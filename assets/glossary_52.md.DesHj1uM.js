The summit is offset to the west of the rocky central ridge of the Maumturks, and its western facing slopes have a distinctive \\"diagonal\\" rock stratification when viewed from the Inagh Valley. Naming Irish academic Paul Tempan records that Knocknahillion derives its name from , which is the name of a nearby townland, that translates as \\"peak of the west elbow\\"; however the translation is apt given the positioning of the peak, which is to the west of the central spine of the Maumturks range at point at which the range turns to a more south-easterly direction (e.g. an elbow). Geography Knocknahillion is in the middle sector of the long north-west to south-east central spine of the Maumturks range in the Connemara National Park. To the north, Knocknahillion is connected to Letterbreckaun, the 2nd highest peak in the range at , by a high winding rocky ridge that includes the subsidiary peak of Knocknahillion North Top at , whose prominence of qualifies it as an Arderin. Further along this ridge lies the minor peak of Barrlugrevagh at , whose prominence of qualifies it as an Arderin Beg.

Hill walking The easiest way summit Knocknahillion is a 5-kilometre 2-3-hour route via the pass of Maumahoge; however, because of its positioning on the high rocky central spine of the central Maumturk range, it is also summited in a longer 14-kilometre 5-6 hour loop-route starting at the col of Maumahoge in the south, climbing Knocknahillion and then along a winding 2-kilometre rocky ridge to the top of Letterbreckaun, before descending via the sharp \\"v-shaped\\" col of Maam Turk (, meaning \\"pass of the boar\\"), from which the entire range bears its name. Knocknahillion is also climbed as part of the Maamturks Challenge, a 25-kilometre 10‚Äì12 hour walk over the full Maumturks range (from Maam Cross to Leenaun), which is considered one of the \\"great classic ridge-walks of Ireland\\", but of \\"extreme grade\\" due to the circa 7,600 feet of total ascent; however, because the peak of Knocknahillon is offset to the west of the core winding rocky ridge, it is not always summited during the challenge. Rock climbing While the Maumturks range is not particularly known for rock climbing routes (unlike Bencorr and its Carrot Ridge spur, across the Inagh Valley), some have been developed at a crag just below and west of Lough Maumahoge (L876 532), with routes of 90 to 190 metres at climbing grades of S to HVS.

History  = Signs of conflicts among the PSI =  Socialists in exile  On 16 November 1926, after the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate voted for the removal of 120 opposition deputies, police closed the headquarters of anti-fascist parties and organizations. The direction of PSI was dissolved, transferring its powers to some managers living abroad and in contact with the socialist secretary Olindo Vernocchi from Rome, while sections ceased to communicate with each other. Remaining parts of the socialist organization were integrated in the Italian federations located in France, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium and Americas.. The new direction of PSI was formed by the maximalist majority emerged during the 19th Congress of PSI in Rome of 1922, when the reformist faction was expelled. Ugo Coccia was elected as the political secretary while Giorgio Salvi was the deputy political and administrative secretary. On 10 December 1926 Avanti! became a weekly newspaper, reduced to a minimal format and with Ugo Coccia as editor-in-chief. Leaders decided to keep the party alive ¬´with its physiognomy, tactics and programme¬ª, recommending to cease every trending activity and to act ¬´in favour of comrades affected by the fascist terror¬ª. Regarding the struggle against fascism, the party declared its will to operate ¬´along with other parties active on the field of class conflict¬ª. = End of parties and first hypothesis of socialist unity = Delegates of the 2nd World Congress of the Comintern. Leon Trotsky is the third from the left, while in front of him there is Giacinto Menotti Serrati, supporter of the merger of PSI with PCd'I. Furthermore, Alfred Rosmer (France), Paul Levi (Germany), Grigory Zinoviev, Nikolai Bukharin and Mikhail Kalinin can also be found. Moscow, 1920. The first party to be dissolved by the Fascist Regime was the Unitary Socialist Party (PSU) on 6 November 1925, founded on 5 October 1922, a day after the 19th Congress of the Italian Socialist Party. After this event, the co-director of Avanti! Pietro Nenni proposed to make way for reformists within the party, recalling Claudio Treves in Avanti! and rebuilding the unity between all socialists. The direction, with the exception of Giuseppe Romita, refused the proposal of Nenni, who left Avanti! and the PSI executive on 17 December 1925 and founded the journal Il Quarto Stato with Carlo Rosselli.. However, Pietro Nenni was not in favour of a fusion with the Communist Party of Italy (PCd'I): in January 1923, he wrote an article on Avanti! entitled La liquidazione del Partito Socialista? (\\"Is this the liquidation of the Socialist Party?\\") where he considered the merger as a liquidation at loss of PSI.La liquidazione del partito socialista? in In the same edition of the newspaper, Giacinto Menotti Serrati, supporter of Comintern and director in charge of Avanti!, published an article exalting to the fusion between PSI and PCd'I.All'unit√† comunista! in An anti-merger movement wasformed in Milan on 14 January 1923 within the National Committee of Socialist Defence (Comitato Nazionale di Difesa Socialista), which occupied the headquarter of Avanti! and elected Tito Oro Nobili as the parliamentary leader, replacing the fusionist Francesco Buffoni. However, the fusionist group founded the National Unionist Committee (Comitato Nazionale Unionista).. PSI was then divided between autonomist and fusionist maximalists and a congress was convened for the 14 November 1926 to discuss about the merger. During that, three points were discussed: * The first one, known as Socialist Defence (Difesa Socialista), was the expression of the maximalist majority (Vella, Vernocchi, Momigliano, Nobili and others) against the merger with PSU but divided on the proposal of joining the International Working Union of Socialist Parties - the future London Bureau formed in 1926 with the Russian revolutionary maximalist Angelica Balabanoff as secretary; * The second one, called Socialist Action (Azione socialista) and supported by Bacci, Mazzali, Morigi and Valeri, was in favour of the unification but on leftist intransigent positions; * The third one, headed by the Committee for Socialist Unity within PSI (Comitato per l‚Äôunit√† socialista nel PSI) and supported by Nenni, Romita, Amedeo, Schiavi and Viotto, was strongly unitary with the PSU. There was also a fourth position, called thirdinternationalist (terzinternazionalista) and supported by Lazzari, Mancini and Clerici, which was in favour of joining the Communist International without presenting any motions but converging its votes on the maximalist motion. This dialectic, derived from the traditional libertarian soul of the party, was completely inconclusive and inadequate to face with determination the contemporary political situation, characterized by freedom-destroying provisions that confirmed the establishment of the fascist regime with the end of syndical freedoms, the illegality of strike proclamation and the suppression of elective communal councils, replaced by mayors appointed by the government.. In the meantime, the congress was not organized and the debate regarding the fusion did not produce any result. A call to the proletarian unity against fascism was addressed by PSI to Unitarian socialists, communists, republicans and anarchists on the Avanti! of 27 February 1927, hoping for ¬´the formation of a strong beam of the working class to oppose against the beam of the bourgeoisie in power in Italy¬ª. The Communist Party of Italy refused the proposal, denouncing the maximalist appeal as ¬´a miserable move of the party¬ª, while the Unitary Socialist Party (PSULI) invited maximalist socialists to join the Antifascist Action Concentration (Concentrazione d‚ÄôAzione Antifascista). Maximalists accepted hoping that the Concentration would welcome also the communists.  Agreement between anti-fascist forces  Badge of a CAI member, 1931. On 27 March 1927, the Italian Anti-Fascist Concentration (Concentrazione Antifascista Italiana, CAI) was formed in Paris and made a public appeal signed by Claudio Treves and Giuseppe Emanuele Modigliani (PSLI), Pietro Nenni and Angelica Balabanoff (PSI),Her adhesion was approved by a referendum among militants. . Fernando Schiavetti and Mario Pistocchi (Italian Republican Party), Bruno Buozzi and Felice Quaglino (CGdL) and by Alceste De Ambris (Italian League for Human Rights, Lega italiana dei diritti dell'uomo, LIDU). The purpose of CAI was the organization of Italian antifascist forces in order to reorganize the anti-fascist movement abroad avoiding to repeat the old divisions existing in Italy before the establishment of the regime. Communists remained outside along with liberals, populars and others in order to keep contact with Italian masses ¬´in their social defence and political resistance moves¬ª. The official weekly newspaper La Libert√† was created on 1 May 1927 with Claudio Treves as director. Due to the divisions among the members, CAI showed poor accomplishing skills since its first actions: it obtained success defending the emigrates in France, urging the intervention of LIDU in the assistance to the victims (including communists) of police provisions. But the work of CAI was insignificant in Italy and for this reason republicans and leftists in particular kept their distances from it without leaving the organization. The leading group authority of PSLI weighed on CAI and imposed itself as the mediator of financial contributions granted by the Labour and Socialist International, of which it was member. Moreover, this circumstance fuelled the left opposition within the PSI, which had its strengths in the sections of Vienne and Paris, where a third formation was formed in favour of the entry of socialists into the Antifascist Proletarian Committees (Comitati Proletari Antifascisti), organized by PCd'I. Socialist left founded Il nostro Avanti (\\"Our Avanti\\") in Paris, a newspaper that antifascists called Il piccolo Avanti (\\"The Little Avanti\\"). = Towards the split =  Convention of Marseille  Contrasts about the fusion sharpened at the end of 1927. The area led by Angelica Balabanoff tried to rebut the fusionist moves of Nenni with an expedient: a political line change and a merger with socialist reformist PSULI had to be confirmed by a formal congress held in Italy, not by an emigrated representation of PSI. In the meantime, the socialist Direction declared a convention for 15 January 1928 in Marseille in order to clarify the PSI relations with PSLI and LSI.. Balabanova did not participate to this convention, because she was in Sweden as a member of the secretary office of the International Information Bureau of Revolutionary Socialist Parties. Also Nenni did not attend because he thought that ¬´It could be useless to participate to a convention where we can not discuss, until it would possible in Italy¬ª.. The debate, joined by 30 delegates, overcame the claim of the Direction to limit the discussion to the only organizational field; all the participants, maximalists, fusionist o thirdinternationalists in favour of a united front with communists, wanted to discuss and deliberate, so that some motions were proposed by the Committee of Defence (maximalist), Filippo Amedeo (fusionist) while others were voted in the different federations, including those of London and Zurich. The convention ended with a majority vote which sanctioned the attitude of the Direction but recommended ¬´the unity of purposes and action of the whole Party for the struggle that comrades of Italy conduct against the fascist dictatorship¬ª and gave a mandate ¬´to the Party Direction in order to hit with an inflexible energy comrades, sections and federations that not observe with loyal discipline to the duties traced by the Convention¬ª. Furthermore, all the members of the assembly admitted the impossibility to keep alive a party organization in Italy. Those results were negatively received by who was openly in favour to the fusion with PSLI. The PSI Direction convened on 19 February 1928 and elected Angelica Balabanoff as new political secretary, along with an Executive Committee formed by Giorgio Salvi, Giovanni Bordini, Siro Burgassi and Ugo Coccia, who would flank Pietro Nenni in the executive of the Antifascist Concentration. The Direction assumed three new members: left maximalist Carlo Marchisio, manager of the Lyon section, fusionist Filippo Amedeo, former syndicalist and deputy of Turin, and maximalist Franco Clerici, already member of PSI Direction in 1921.  Appeal to the revolutionary unity  An important symbol of Italian anti- fascism: the flag of Arditi del Popolo. Those events were not appreciated by socialists who were convinced about the necessity to strengthen the LSI. Among them there was the Grand Orient of Paris: according to a confidential communication of the Italian Ministry of the Interior, it deliberated to push on socialist leaders in order to achieve the fusion of the two parties ¬´generally not belonging to Masonry¬ª, of whose support ¬´they need every day for work purposes and political protection¬ª. The intervention of the Grand Orient, which had a great influence in the French political life, was probably defined by factors of international politics like threatens of crises that Benito Mussolini alluded during a speech of 5 June 1927. In February 1928, PSI direction renewed the leading bodies and deliberated a manifest as an appeal to the unity of revolutionary left in which ¬´the two great illusions maturated during the war with the proletariat were attacked: the collaborationist illusion and the Bolshevik one¬ª, expecting the liquidation of the two working class internationals (LSI and Comintern) and aiming to recreate the international proletarian unity achieved before WWI. Adversaries to the appeal moved resolutely to action starting to push on hesitants. Nenni, along with Amedeo Clerici from Vienna and Ugo Coccia, openly criticized the Direction. Coccia left the direction of Avanti! when the Authority Direction declared closed every discussion about the fusion with reformists, and he was replaced on 12 August 1928 by the political secretary Angelica Balabanoff herself. On 3 February 1929, Balabanoff wrote on the socialist newspaper:Il Partito √® intangibile in The autonomist majority imposed the ceasing of the debate on socialist unity and took disciplinary actions after rebellions among federal conventions. The controversy within PSI became unstoppable and spread also outside the French borders, in particular among the Italian Socialist Federation of Switzerland which was publishing in Zurich L'Avvenire dei lavoratori (\\"The Future of Workers\\"), supporter at the time of pro-merger positions. Nenni was alleged to be approached by a ¬´person sent specially from Italy¬ª who propose to him a return in exchange for a charge among fascist labour unions. Fascist OVRA police took advantage from this situation and infiltrated some agents in the PSI section of Paris. Another cause of conflicts within the party was the role of the Concentration: Balabanoff accused reformists (who were holding the power inside the association as well as the LSI funds) to keep it inert. She aimed to a more wide unitary solution, within the framework of a political line of the unity of all the proletarian movement but without breaking up with the Concentration.  Convention of Grenoble and the fusionist split  Fusionists then formed the Committee for Socialist Unity (Comitato per l'unit√† socialista) and Nenni asked moreover for a regular congress to be held. The direction, under the protests of opponents who objected the threaten of an auto-convocation by rebel federations, postponed a convention about organizational problems initially scheduled for 6 January 1930. However, the direction expelled 58 militants. On 16 March, two different meetings were held in Grenoble among tensions:Il 2¬∫ Convegno del P.S.I., all'estero in * The fusionist group, headed by Coccia and Nenni, debated until the morning of 17 March and elected a direction formed by Antonio Bianchi, Franco Clerici, Ugo Coccia, Mario Gabici and Pietro Nenni, appointed as secretary and director of L‚ÄôAvvenire dei Lavoratori of Zurich * The maximalist autonomist group, led by Angelica Balabanoff, elected a new direction formed by Sigfrido Ciccotti, Carlo Marchisio, Oreste Mombello, Pietro Refolo, Giorgio Salvi (deputy secretary and administrative secretary) and Gino Tempia. Autonomists confirmed Balabanoff as political secretary and nominated the \\"fiduciary directionals\\" of the Federations, formed by convinced workers, and intensified the relations with socialists in Latin America. Both factions claimed to have the majority in the party, obtained actually by fusionists in Zurich, London and Marseille, while the left claimed to have the three-quarters of subscribers to PSI. During a reunion, fusionist ascertained that the direction did not want to revoke the expulsion measures (rejecting also their motion) and they decided to not participate to the Convention held in the local Bourse du Travail. Another split of PSI happened when a group of maximalist terzini visited the two political assemblies announcing their adhesion to the Communist Party of Italy.  Dispute on Avanti! and the name of the party  Pietro Nenni, deputy secretary and editor-in-chief of L'Avvenire dei lavoratori of Zurich, renamed his newspaper to Avanti! on 22 March 1930, forcing then Angelica Balabanoff and his party to make appeal to justice: the court annulled the renaming and conceded the rights of Avanti! to the maximalists, who would publish the newspaper until 1 May 1940. In 1934, Nenni tried again to take the Avanti! in Paris, but the local court impeded him and his newspaper was later renamed to Nuovo Avanti (\\"New Avanti\\", without the exclamation mark). Another dispute regarded the old abbreviation of PSI, because on the socialist cards released in exile by the fraction of Pietro Nenni, from 1931 until the creation of the first Italian Socialist Party of Proletarian Unity, had the wording Partito Socialista Italiano-Sezione dell'Internazionale operaia socialista (or PSI-IOS, literally \\"Italian Socialist Party - Section of Labour Socialist International\\"). While the cards released by maximalist socialists (who legally held the rights on the old name) had the simple abbreviation Partito Socialista Italiano, modern historians add the adjective \\"massimalista\\" (\\"maximalist\\") to it. Those circumstances suggest the Balabanoff area was the majoritarian one. = Looking for a political line =  Exit from Concentration and General Confederation of Labour  Under the hegemony of internal left, PSIm quitted the Concentration, claiming that it was not the ideal place for \\"authentic revolutionary\\" forces. Moreover, the party decided to leave the reformist General Confederation of Labour led by Bruno Buozzi, who wanted to join the Sindacati Rossi (\\"Red Unions\\") formed by the communists. Meanwhile, the fusionist fraction of Nenni managed the confluence into the new party, during a congress known as the 21st Congress or Congresso dell‚ÄôUnit√† (\\"Congress of Unity\\") held in the House of French Socialists between 19 and 20 July 1930 in Paris. Among the representatives of various foreign socialist parties, there were 47 delegates representing 1017 members for fusionist maximalists and other 50, representing 811 former members of PSULI. Nenni, along with Giuseppe Saragat, performed an operation intended to liquidate reformism and maximalism in favour of the establishment of a ¬´rigorously Marxist and democratic socialism, adopting the class struggle as instrument and the liberation of humanity from every economical and political serfdom as purpose¬ª. The party was then affiliated with the Labour Socialist International, and the name chosen for the unified party was Partito Socialista Italiano-Sezione dell‚ÄôInternazionale operaia socialista. In 1931, due to internal divergences, Nenni distanced himself from the party of Guido Salvi, deputy political secretary of PSIm as well as administrative secretary and owner of the Avanti!. The newspaper administrator Giuseppe Andrich resigned too, while Avanti! and the party were in serious economical troubles. In a climate of attacks from PCd'I when it was carrying out the political line of ‚Äúsocial fascism‚Äù, the third General Convention of the Italian (Maximalist) Socialist Party was hold abroad in Lyon on 27 and 28 March 1932.  Between the ideological and political identity of the United Front  The last common appearance of the old guard of Bolshevik Party during the funerals of Felix Dzerzhinsky on 30 April 1926. Between Kalinin, Kamenev and Bucharin, there are Joseph Stalin and Leon Trotsky. About sixty delegates took part to the PSIm Lyon convention, debating on the anti-fascist struggle and the relations with other organizations abroad. The exit from the Italian League for Human Rights was approved, confirming the leave from CGdL, while the join to Red Unions was proposed but rejected by the majority of delegates, who approved instead the participation of PSIm to a united front with communists. In 1932, after the death of Turati and Coccia, Nenni and Saragat reinforced their role within the PSI-LSI. In a turbulent international situation, communists were talking about a \\"world revolution\\" while socialists (including PSIm) were attracted by the opposition to Stalin of Leon Trotsky. Meanwhile, the rise to power of the National Socialist German Workers‚Äô Party pushed Italian communists to begin negotiations with other leftists parties in order to create a consultative committee regarding actions to be performed in Italy and abroad. A few days later, the 22nd Congress of PSI-LSI was held in Marseille on 17‚Äì18 April 1933.. An invitation was addressed to PSIm for the reconstruction of the socialist unity among the LSI, while the proletarian one with communists was complained, but refusing the Bolshevik notion of power which would have dictatorship and terrorism as main fatal consequences. On 4 and 5 June 1933, during the 4th convention of PSIm, the Direction identified as the main causes of the victory of fascism and nazism not only the misunderstanding of the two phenomena by Second and Third International, but also the paralysis provoked by disagreements and fratricidal fights within the action of masses which destroyed the faith in the future revolution. The convention tried to stimulate comrades by creating positive statements and reporting the successes obtained in the struggles to perform syndicalist and class unity among Italian emigrates, and giving themselves the merit to have associated the parties adhering to the Cominform with a call for unity addressed to the two Internationals. An intermediate movement was formed among the Direction and it considered the creation of a sincere and effective agreement of proletarian organizations as the main task of the party, in order to give back to masses the faith in the future revolution and the necessary force to oppose the imperialism and transform the capitalist society into a socialist one. It was recommended the abstention from everything could break the new contacts established among members of the different proletarian movements, evidencing the need to denounce to the proletarian public opinion all whose activities that aimed to the establishment of the supremacy at the expense of the other. The debate focused mainly on the relations with PCd'I and the creation of a united front with communists, a proposal which would be later approved. Balabanoff was confirmed as secretary and director of Avanti!, with Dino Mariani as deputy secretary. Despite the LSI was considered by the maximalist PSI as \\"the International of war and collaborationist reformism, den of social chauvinists\\", this kind of collaborative \\"elasticity\\" or spirit of understanding towards the London Bureau was a surprise. While Leon Trotsky accused the merger of Spanish right and communist left into the POUM as a \\"surrender to centrism\\", Italian maximalists considered it as a clear example of \\"reconstitution of the proletarian unity\\".  Socialist left conferences  Left Opposition of Leon Trotsky, one of co-signers of the Declaration of Four. On 19 June 1933, while Adolf Hitler was conquering the power in Weimar Republic, a World Conference was held in Bruxelles with all the proletarian organizations not affiliated with Comintern nor Labour Socialist International. During that conference, a permanent committee was formed and Angelica Balabanoff declared: The representatives of 14 marxists held a Conference in Paris between 27 and 28 August of the same year, and three different sides faced each other in that occasion: * The one belonging to the Labour Party of Norway and French Proletarian Unity Party (PUP) which was collocated in the tradition of Vienna International and claimed that every common action with the Communist International was impracticable. This side was also in favour to the reunification of the proletarian movement through the social democracy. * An intermediate position, defended also by the British Independent Labour Party, which aimed to a future alliance with Comintern. * While other organizations - including PSIm - considered failed the reformist LSI and the Comintern controlled by USSR. However, members of this faction had various lines of thought: the most extreme ones were deduced by Socialist Workers' Party of Germany, Dutch Independent Socialist Party and Revolutionary Socialist Party, as well as by the Left Opposition, which signed a manifest (known as the \\"Declaration of Four\\") in favour of a new Workers' International and the foundation of new communist parties. While acknowledging the failure of the two main international political forces of the proletarian movement, the Swedish Communist Party, the Spanish Federaci√≥n Comunista and the Independent Labour Socialist Party (NSPP) of Poland refused to participate to a new international. Commemorative plate of the illegal typography of the Workers' Socialist Party of Germany, co-signer party of the Declaration of Four. Among the poor results of the Paris Conference, there were the proposal of boycotting Germany and holding a world congress ¬´representing all the workers' organizations of the world that accept the need of struggle to realize socialism as a basis¬ª. Due to the heterogeneity of point of views of the participants to the conference, no common decision could be adopted about the new International. During the Conference, communists were criticized about the United Front and the committees against war, while the participation of PSIm annoyed PCd'I. Later, a policy of rapprochement to reformists provoked an internal controversy and various federations and sections intervened, forcing the Direction to gather in order to answers to the communist direction and the United Front Committee Against Fascism and War. In this occasion, the PSIm was allowed to criticize the mistakes committed by the two International and it could contact the other political organizations in order to achieve the syndical union. PSIm was also allowed to invite Trotskyists and other proletarian political tendencies to the debate.  Message to comrades of Italy  Since the elections of 1933 in the Second Spanish Republic, with the rise of the Spanish Confederation of Autonomous Rights (CEDA) and the establishment of a government coalition with radicals within the cabinet of Alejandro Lerroux,. revolts led by anarchic syndicates blew up throughout the country and provoked the general strike organized by left labour unions on 5 October 1934, causing revolutionary popular motions in Asturias. These events convinced Angelica Balabanoff about the coming of the ideal time to reprise contact with socialists in Italy. A committee formed by Dino Mariani and the political secretary tried to send an invitation to trustees living in Italy and the secretaries of sections abroad. The message was formed by seven pages divided into two documents and stated that: * Fascism managed ¬´to spiritually pulverize masses, scare them, disorient them and to lead them towards indifference and wide passivity¬ª * ¬´The action of the Party should set the goal of arousing, first of all, a mass movement around immediate claim through a work to be done among the ‚ÄúFascist institutions of labour‚Äù¬ª * The general criteria assigned to the socialist action consisted in ¬´the creation of a dynamism having masses as the subject or which can directly give that attitude to them‚Äù: as a mean, the party should be organized into groups ‚Äúof revolutionary avant-garde‚Äù¬ª * The party should be warned about ‚Äúintransigentists‚Äù and ‚Äúvisionary activists‚Äù (who aimed to a general strike and an armed insurrection, considering unstable the fascist regime) as well as those who were waiting for operate ¬´sufficient enlargement in the meshes of the dictatorship¬ª The second part of the letter indicated the themes of propaganda to promote, drawing the attention of activists to the active movement among the fascist youth, who ¬´takes seriously the devilries of the fascist arsenal and believes in the anti-capitalistic function of corporations¬ª. The letter ensured Italian socialists that the PSI Direction did not want to impose any political and tactical directives to the Italian groups, nor a dictatorial organization control. Furthermore, it stated that the programme had to be reworked according to the needs that would be revealed with the development of the movement in Italy.  Convention of Saint-Ouen  Meanwhile, PSIm held its General Convention in Paris between 30 and 31 December 1934. It was attended by 52 delegates and Dino Mariani introduced the debate with an article published on Avanti! of 30 December, the opening day of the assembly.Oggi si apre il V¬∞ Convegno delle Sezioni all'Estero del P.S.I. on Mariani accused the division among the labour and socialist movement provoked by right and left sections, between social democratic and communist leaders, for the victories achieved by the fascist reaction in Italy and elsewhere. He talked then about the need to unite the working class in both the syndical and political field. Mariani also condemned the refusal to the PSIm question to be admitted to the Unity of Action Pact, and he invited comrades to insist in asking for the proletarian unity based ¬´on clear principles¬ª. The motion summarizing the works included a courageous defence of the Russian Revolution, but at the same time it included also a severe criticism towards the ant-unitary behaviour of Comintern leaders, and concluded indicating the points of the programme that the Party established for the immediate future. An idea of a new relation with communists made instead its way through the cadres of PSIm since the Marseille Congress of 1933. This re-approaching process between PSI-LSI and PCd'I culminated into the Unity of Action Pact signed on 17 August 1934, although PSIm was exclued. Pietro Nenni and Giuseppe Saragat signed for socialists, but the ideas of Saragat regarding communists were preserved at the ideological level but outdated at the political one; the joint struggle against the common fascist enemy was considered instead as an absolute priority. That happened while actions of the United Front did not seem to proceed well, given that there were resistances against the joint action among the Labour Socialist International. According to Nenni, only the collaboration on the syndical level could be possible; while communists stated that ¬´the PSI-LSI was invited to a self-criticism for the wrong behaviour towards the allies¬ª. = Hypothesis of the new Labour International =  Conference of Paris  In February 1935, a conference was held in Paris by left socialists among the London Bureau and two different political sides clashed: one wanted to ¬´work for the unity of working class¬ª, while another one aimed to engage ¬´for the revolutionary unit of the working class, which it would not be realized between the two existing internationals - LSI and Comintern, considered as a failure¬ª, and asked for the establishment of a new international body. The unity of parties signatory of the ¬´Declaration of Four¬ª in June 1933 (proclaiming ¬´the establishment of a new proletarian International and new communist parties¬ª), was however deteriorated: since the beginning, the SAPD and the Dutch Independent Socialist Party voted in favour of the \\"resolution on the reconstruction of the world labour movement\\", without advancing the prospective of a new proletarian International and consequently keeping their affiliation to the Internationale Arbeitsgemeinschaft (IAG), a body of the London Bureau considered \\"centrist\\" by Left Opposition. Furthermore, there were divergences between SAP and the Trotskyist movement about how a new International had to be created: according to SAP, this should happen through a long process of maturation of labour movement avant-garde; while Trotskyist stated that it was necessary to immediately select an avant-garde at world level according to a very precise programme, explaining the need of this kind of construction work. During the Conference, the debate about a new International divided the PSIm, with a part of its Direction around Balabanoff in favour of it and a group around Dino Mariani against. However, the party joined the proposal presented by SAP that expected a long period of fascism rule in Germany and Italy and a mass orientation to left-wing, advising also to ¬´facilitate, help social democratic left movements¬ª in Germany and Austria, urging to defend the democratic freedoms and developing an active police in the other countries..  Policies of Popular Fronts  \\"Soviets are the ones who pull the threads of the Popular Front\\"; manifest of Independent Republicans for French elections of 1936. In July 1935, at the same time of the \\"frontist\\" turn of Comintern during its 7th Congress (25 July - 20 August 1935), French Communist Party and Section of the Workers' International formed the Popular Front along with other smaller French left-wing groups, inaugurating the political line of Popular fronts followed also by SAP in Germany during the same period. The PSIm group of Dino Mariani accepted the invitation by Communist Party of Italy and PSI-LSI to join the Congress of Italians abroad, while a group of PSIm militants solicited for a merger with PSI-LSI. The PSI-LSI Direction convened in Paris on 14 and 15 July 1935 and approved the motion in favour of the ¬´realization of one of the main goals of workers: one Party, one syndical organization, one International¬ª, in order to support the quest of peace and, in case of an attack against the Soviet Union, to ¬´defend Russia without any kind of compromises with any imperialism¬ª. A common manifest was stipulated with communists ¬´to turn the war towards the defeat of fascism and the victory of popular revolution, for a socialist Italy¬ª. Among PSI-LSI, resistances against the Unity of Action Pact with PCd'I arose: Pietro Tresso and Nicola Di Bartolomeo, exponents of New Italian Opposition (Nuova Opposizione Italiana, NOI), stated that ¬´the Popular Front would lead to the capitulation in Stalin's hands¬ª, considering ¬´the constitution of a Fourth International as necessary¬ª. Meanwhile, Leon Trotsky inaugurated his new entrist tactic in order to ¬´conquer and transform them into \\"marxist revolutionary parties\\" - or destroy them¬ª (referring to parties considered as \\"centrists\\" by him), expecting a long battle during that it was necessary to clarify and sharpen contradictions among those parties for an internal differentiation. The NOI, founded as an opposition group within PCd'I against the political line dictated by the party following the turn of so- called Third Period, was expelled by the Central Committee of 9 June 1930 which accused the opposition of ¬´contacting Trotskyists, conducting a slanderous campaign against the party and having a ‚Äúwrong evaluation of the prospectives of the fascist regime‚Äù¬ª. NOI then became the Italian section of the International Left Opposition and subsequently joined PSI-LSI.. The debate within PSIm about the need of a new proletarian International saw the group of Balabanoff in favour of the Trotskyist proposal, and due to that the party accepted two meetings with dissident NOI exponents of PSI-LSI organized in September 1935.  Agreement Committee with communist left  A meeting was held in Brussels at the end of October 1935 between Alessandro Consani for PSIm and the leaders of Left Fraction of PCd'I, followed by a meeting held on 5 November by Consani, Dino Mariani, Nicola Di Bartolomeo and other Trotskyist exponents for their admission to the party. Another meeting was held five days later, with the participation of Trotskyist Mario Bavassano, and the formation of an Agreement Committee (Comitato d‚ÄôIntesa) was approved, pushing on Pietro Tresso, Alfonso Leonetti, Paolo Ravazzoli and other NOI leader in order to make them join to PSIm. The Party Direction, considering the leave of Balabanoff to the United States, redistributed the charges: international relations were entrusted to Balabanoff and Giuseppe Andrich, relations with not French federations to Santo Semeraro, communications with the United Front to Siro Burgassi, while Dino Mariani became the effective secretary replacing Angelica Balabanoff. Meanwhile, a polemic was provoked towards Dino Mariani by Alessandro Consani, a maximalist leader who would be later revealed as an agent provocateur and spy for Fascist OVRA,. and Mariani resigned from most of his charges, being aware of his limits and his absolute dedication to the cause that he did not want to hinder. = Armed representation during the Spanish Civil War =  Victories of lefts in Spain and coup d'etat  Flag of the Popular Front. The 1936 Spanish general election was won by the Popular Front (Frente Popular) with 4,176,156 votes and 276 deputies, against 3,783,601 votes of the Counter-revolutionary National Front with 132 deputies.. Since the first days after the victory of the Popular Front, peasants began to occupy the lands of their owners,. and left activists started to request the amnesty for prisoners among the cities. In Oviedo, jails were opened and detainees freed.. These events gave hopes among exiled antifascists who thought about how to act in Italy. However, a group of officers tried to overtake the Popular Front government with a military coup. The uprising became active between 17 and 18 July 1936, and also if the rebellion had to be a \\"quick coup d'√©tat\\", the republican government was able to maintain the control over most of the country.. Fascist Italy of Mussolini and Nazi Germany of Hitler violated the embargo against Spain and sent troops and vehicles to golpists, unleashing a civil war occurred..  Maximalist military engagement in POUM  With the motto ¬´Oggi in Spagna, domani in Italia!¬ª (\\"Today in Spain, tomorrow in Italy\\") launched by Carlo Rosselli, Giustizia e Libert√† and the Maximalist Italian Socialist Party gave their support to republicans and addressed an appeal to other anti-fascist parties among Italian emigrates, in order to make them intervene in the conflict. About thirty maximalist socialists came in Spain to join the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (Partido Obrero de Unificaci√≥n Marxista, POUM), the Spanish homologue and political referent of PSIm. Among them there was Giuseppe Bogoni, who settled in Perpignano as a link officer with Aldo Garosci, the organizer of the Italian column armed and trained in Barcelona by Mario Angeloni. Meanwhile, another Italian formation, guided by the militant of the Italian Fraction of Communist Left Enrico Russo, joined to the first international brigade formed in Spain, Columna Internacional Lenin (Lenin International Column), created by POUM for the Aragona front in July 1936. Chapter: El POUM, la revoluci√≥n y la guerra, tenth paragraph. On 29 July, PSIm Direction sent a solidarity letter to POUM, and Juli√°n Gorkin answered thanking in the name of his party secretary, while the socialist newspaper Avanti! exalted the Spanish revolutionary action. PSIm gave its support to POUM by sending men. and funds through Alessandro Consani, despite their financial troubles. Between 31 October and 2 November 1936, the London Bureau indicted an \\"International Conference Against War and Fascism\\" in Brussels , to which PSIm Direction took part, and that was preceded by a meeting between PSIm, POUM, SAP and SFIO revolutionary left (Marceau Pivert, Michel Collinet and Michel Duchesne). PSIm agreed with the proposal of POUM regarding the creation of a new Workers' International, but French were not in favour and concrete decisions were not made. Meanwhile, Avanti! and PSIm defended POUM which was ousted by the Catalan government due to a denounce of \\"Trotskyism\\". = WWII and dismantle = The Maximalist Italian Socialist Party continued its political activity and the publishing of Avanti! (which remained to maximalists) beyond 1940, but it was dismantled after the end of WWII, joining the Italian Socialist Party of Proletarian Unity (Partito Socialista Italiano di Unit√† Proletaria, PSIUP). Some PSIm exponents preferred to join instead the Italian Communist Party. Balabanoff later abandoned the maximalist positions and adhered to the Italian Democratic Socialist Party (Partito Socialista Democratico Italiano, PSDI).  Ideological profile  The historical and ideological base of Maximalist Italian Socialist Party was the maximalist socialism which had controlled the PSI since the 13rd Socialist Congress of Reggio Emilia held in July 1912. Considering maximalism as an interpretation of the SPD Erfurt Program and an archaic concept of parties of Second International related to Orthodox Marxism and debates since the first 20th century, along with the rising revisionist movement, the unity of the Italian proletariant movement was undermined by theoretical re-elaborations done since the first years of 1900 by other Marxists, in particular by Lenin, provoking the split up during the 17th Congress of PSI. From those assumptions, Maximalist PSI characterized itself for a strict ideological intransigence, remaining faithful to the concept of dictatorship of the proletariat but with a different interpretation from whose imposed in the USSR of Stalin.. The political rigour of PSIm led Palmiro Togliatti to define the exiled party as a ¬´Trotskyist-poumist sect of provocateurs¬ª. In view of the International Conference Against War and Fascism convened by the London Bureau (31 October - 2 November 1936), PSIm promulgated a resolution of participation whose declaration of principle hoped the Bureau transformation ¬´from a simple connection point to a coordination body¬ª, and where the following proposal were postulated resuming the political positions of PSIm: * The possibility of an ideological change for the better had to be denied to LSI and Comintern, ascentaining their failure; * PSIm position had to be redefined in relation of the anarchical and trotskyist movement, on the base of experience in Russia and Spain; * The concept of dictatorship of proletariat should be replaced with that of the \\"revolutionary power of the proletariat\\"; * The definition of United Front should be replaced with \\"revolutionary front\\"; * The proletarian characteristic of the Soviet Union had to be recognized, even denying the identification of \\"socialist state\\" because its labour productivity was less than that of the capitalist society, the revenue distribution gave place to privileged castes and the despotism of Stalinian bureaucracy would suppress every principle of proletarian democracy . Despite the acts of generosity and anti-fascist coherence done by PSIm toward the Communist Party of Italy and PSI-LSI, the group of Balabanoff remained always firmly critical against these political subjects.  International affiliation  Maximalist PSI was affiliated to the International Revolutionary Marxist Centre (IRMC), also known as London Bureau. This took origin from the experience of Vienna International founded on 27 February 1921 by a series of left socialist parties with the purpose of overcoming the division suffered by the world proletarian movement after the October Revolution and the establishment of Communist International. The experience ended with a failure and, on 10 May 1923, some parties of the Vienna International rejoined reformists of the former Second International and co-founded the Labour Socialist International. Socialist parties that were still faithful to the revolutionary method as the way to socialism, including PSI, formed instead the International Information Bureau of Revolutionary Socialist Parties, the future London Bureau. The IRMC, after being politically near to the trotskyist movement and Left Opposition since the first years of the 1930s, became a meeting point for those parties ideologically belonging to communist left, communist right and left socialism. Chapter: Organizzazioni presenti alla Conferenza di Parigi del 1933, fitth paragraph. So that in August 1933 two different political orientations appeared: one claimed that left socialism should work for the unity of working class, while the another one aimed to the revolutionary unity of the working class, which could not be achieved by the failed policies of the two existing Internationals but only through the creation of a new International. at the beginning of the 1940s, while the Soviet Union did no longer advocate for a world revolution but it was defending only its own national interests, and the reformism had been completely included in the system of bourgeois companies and capitalism, Chapter: Il massimalismo alla guida del partito (see first paragraph). the IRMC and most of its parties suffered due to this situation and the World War II.

Arian has won several international awards for his achievements, and regularly speaks as an expert in innovation, technology and global health. Early life Arian was born on 5 August 1983 in Kabul, Afghanistan. His early childhood was spent during the Soviet-Afghan conflict, his family frequently moving home because of the fighting. His schooling was significantly disrupted as schools were often closed. As the fighting intensified, Arian's parents made the decision to seek safety in Pakistan. His family made a hazardous seven-day mountain crossing, travelling at night to try to avoid Soviet military aircraft. Arian and his father narrowly avoiding being killed during a rocket attack during the crossing. Arian's family eventually reached safety at a Peshawar refugee camp, but conditions were poor and the family of 10 were living in a single room with no running water or electricity. Arian contracted tuberculosis (TB) and malaria, and suffered from malnutrition. Arian was treated by a volunteer doctor at the camp, who was pivotal in inspiring him to study medicine. Arian's family returned to Kabul following the Soviet withdrawal in 1989. However, the civil war ensued soon after and when it began to heighten in 1999, with Arian aged 15, his parents sent him to safety in the UK, to stay with a distant family friend.

Malaysia rejects China's nine-dash line claim which covers most of the South China Sea and extends much further than from China's shoreline. The nine-dash line runs through Malaysia's Exclusive Economic Zone in the South China Sea and would reduce Malaysia's EEZ by 2/5th. In the latter half of the 1970s, Malaysia and the Philippines began referring to the Spratly Islands as included in their own territory. On 11 June 1978, President Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines issued the Presidential decree No. 1596, declaring the north-western part of the Spratly Islands (referred to therein as the Kalayaan Island Group) as Philippine territory. Since the 1990s, Malaysia occupies 5 of the Spratly Islands.

Career Ded was elected Bishop of V√°c sometime after 1157, when his predecessor Hippolytus was last mentioned by contemporary records. The name of Ded appears in a single document without the exact date. Accordingly, G√©za II ordered Ded of V√°c and Chama of Eger to rededicate the Szentjobb Abbey (present-day S√¢niob in Romania) with the consent of Lucas, Archbishop of Esztergom. Consequently, the narration occurred sometime between 1158 (Lucas' ascension to the see of Esztergom) and 1162 (the death of G√©za II). The aforementioned document was issued by G√©za's son and successor Stephen III of Hungary, who narrated in his charter that the Benedictine monastery of Szentjobb was attacked and plundered by the sons of a certain \\"Palatine Paul\\" thereafter. As a result, Archbishop Lucas excommunicated them. The charter was later transcribed by both B√©la III of Hungary and Charles I of Hungary and preserved until the 18th century. Its text was published and annotated by Croatian historian Baltazar Adam Krƒçeliƒá in his work Historiarum cathedralis ecclesiae Zagrabiensis partis primae tomus I, and it is the only surviving text form as the original charter is lost. Historian Tam√°s K√∂rmendi questioned the validity of the issuance, which suffers from 18th-century misinterpretations, explanations, anachronisms and factual errors made by plausibly Krƒçeliƒá, thus the authenticity of the original lost royal charter is also uncertain. According to 18th-century historians Istv√°n Katona and Gy√∂rgy Pray, Ded still held the dignity of Bishop of V√°c in 1169, but there is no source of that.

She encouraged female education in the state.Contemporary Review 105 (1914), p.335 In 1908 she visited England with her husband and sister. The couple were childless, and in 1913 the Nawab married another woman with Nazli's consent. After a son was born to this wife, Nazli moved to live in Bombay, with guards 'suitable to her rank' provided at state expense. In 1915 she relinquished a Rs 3,000 monthly allowance, and returned state jewellery, but maintained her guards. After Ahmad Khan died in 1922, Janjira State subsequently stopped paying for her retinue of guards. In July 1926 she brought a complaint to the British government. Her complaint came to court in 1930-31, and the Janjira state successfully argued that she had been divorced. Nazli argued that a divorce deed had never been served on her, and that - since she was a Shia Muslim - any divorce should have followed Shia law. In 1933 she gained the support of Mohammad Iqbal. Iqbal wrote on her behalf to the private secretary of Lord Willingdon, the British Governor. Nazli continued to press for the right to be called 'ex-Begum of Janjira', though the state of Janjira remained resistant to her claims.

He was a recipient of the Military Order of William for his actions in the Dutch East Indies campaign while serving in the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army and was the only Indonesian in the war to receive a highest military honor from an allied country during World War II. He briefly held various cabinet posts in the State of East Indonesia during the Indonesian National Revolution in 1947 and later worked for and established the Indrapura conglomerate which became one of the largest in the country. Early life and education Tahija was born in Surabaya, then part of Dutch East Indies, on 13 July 1916. Tahija was of Ambonese descent. Due to his father's efforts, Tahija received Dutch education at the Handels School (trading school), as he had initially intended to pursue a career in business. Military and political career In 1937, Tahija joined the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL). He initially received training as a pilot, but was transferred to infantry ‚Äì according to Tahija, he believed that this was due to his uncle's pro-independence views. He saw action in Aceh before World War II. =World War II= Following the outbreak of the Pacific War, he was dispatched to Australia to escort a group of Japanese civilians interned there. After the beginning of the Dutch East Indies campaign, Tahija (then a sergeant) volunteered to lead a group of Indonesian soldiers on an intelligence gathering mission to Saumlaki in the Tanimbar Islands. According to Tahija's accounts, he arrested several Japanese spies and discovered that Japanese forces were about to stage a landing on the island. After setting up some trenches with the help of local officials, the group ambushed the Japanese soldiers who landed before dawn, with around eighty Japanese soldiers killed before Tahija and his party retreated into the jungle. The group ‚Äì which had been reduced from thirteen to seven men ‚Äì managed to secure a schooner and sailed back to Australia's Bathurst Island with 27 (including local officials and other civilians) on board. He was later bestowed with a Military Order of William, fourth class award in August 1942 for the Saumlaki action, the only Indonesian to receive the highest military decoration from an allied nation during WWII. His six surviving comrades also received other awards. Tahija (far right) with Simon Spoor and Hubertus van Mook in 1947 Tahija (left) as Minister of Social Affairs, meeting Dutch politician Carl Romme in 1947 Later, he was promoted to lieutenant and served in American general Charles A.

During his time in Australia, he met and began to date Victoria-born dentist Jean Walters, and the two later married in 1946. =Indonesian Revolution= During the Indonesian National Revolution, Tahija was the adjutant of Simon Spoor. Despite his position, he maintained good personal relationships with nationalist leaders, especially Sutan Sjahrir. Between 1946 and 1949, he also played a part in the formation of the State of East Indonesia (NIT). He was one of the candidates for the state's first provisional legislature, though he was defeated in the leadership vote by Tadjoeddin Noor. He also served in the Cabinet of the State of East Indonesia, where he initially was made Minister of Social Affairs under Nadjamuddin Daeng Malewa's first cabinet, and later taking up the post of Minister of Information in Malewa's second cabinet between 2 June and 11 October 1947. His next cabinet post was the Minister of Economy between 11 October and 15 December 1947 in S.J. Warrouw's cabinet. He then became head of NIT's representative office in Jakarta. Journalist Rosihan Anwar wrote that Tahija approved of the 1947 Dutch offensive against the Indonesian nationalist forces, but disapproved of the second, 1948 offensive. He attended the Dutch‚ÄìIndonesian Round Table Conference as a representative of the Federal Consultative Assembly (BFO). Following the conclusion of the conference and the recognition of Indonesian sovereignty, Tahija transferred to the Armed Forces of the United States of Indonesia (Angkatan Perang Republik Indonesia Serikat/APRIS) as a lieutenant colonel. During his service at APRIS ‚Äì later the Indonesian National Armed Forces ‚Äì he gave advice to the Indonesian government during military operations against the Republic of South Maluku and was assigned under Ahmad Yani in a mission to purchase arms. He resigned from military service in 1951. Business career After leaving military service, Tahija was introduced to Caltex by an acquaintance in the U.S. Army. Tahija himself noted that he \\"learned to be a manager\\" at the company, and he eventually became the managing director of the Indonesian branch of the company on 1971, a position he held for six years. During this time, he also engaged in business activities outside Caltex ‚Äì which he had explicitly requested to be permitted for in his contract of employment. During his time at the company, Tahija's links with Sukarno spared Caltex from the nationalization of foreign companies conducted by the Indonesian government in the 1950s. Tahija's companies operated under a conglomerate, known as the Indrapura group. The group was centered around an insurance company with the same name which was one of the largest in Indonesia during the 1950s. In 1955, Tahija founded Bank Niaga in a partnership with Soedarpo Sastrosatomo. By 1972, Tahija's group had become the bank's main shareholder, until it sold a controlling 40 percent stake to Hashim Djojohadikusumo in 1997 for Rp 605 billion (US$232.3 million at the time). Following Suharto's takeover of the presidency, Tahija maintained his influence, and he was given some interest in the newly established Grasberg mine of Freeport-McMoRan after he approached the company to negotiate with the Indonesian government in 1965. Later on, he was part of a joint venture to provide power for the mine with a 10 percent stake in Puncak Jaya Power. By 1994, Indrapura group was Indonesia's ninth- largest conglomerate by asset and 25th in terms of revenue. It was also the largest conglomerate held by \\"indigenous\\" Indonesians in terms of assets, the value of which was estimated at US$2.9 billion in 1994. Aside from his conglomerate, Tahija at some point served as the chairman of Trisakti University, became a trustee for the World Wildlife Fund, and joined the business advisory council of the International Finance Corporation. President Suharto awarded him with the Bintang Mahaputra Nararya in 1994. Later life and death Tahija and his wife founded the charitable Tahija Foundation in 1990, which works on health, education, culture, environment and social services. He was also made an honorary member of the Order of Australia in February 2002 for \\"service to Australian-Indonesian business relations\\". Anwar wrote that in their last encounter, Tahija had said to Anwar: Tahija died in Jakarta on 30 July 2002, at the age of 86. At the time of his death, he had two sons. He was buried next to his wife in Puncak, West Java.

It is mostly in Hardin County, with sections in Hamilton County. The district serves Hubbard and Radcliffe. History The district formed on July 1, 1993, with the merger of the Hubbard and Radcliffe school districts.\\"REORGANIZATION & DISSOLUTION ACTIONS SINCE 1965-66.\\" Iowa Department of Education. Retrieved on July 20, 2018. From 1997 to 2006, the district enrollment decreased by 130 students, or 20% of the original total. In 2006 the Iowa Department of Education figures resulted in a projection that the enrollment would, from 2006 to circa 2011, decline by an additional 65 students, or 13%. It began a grade-sharing arrangement with Hubbard-Radcliffe in 2006, with the former housing senior high school and the latter hosting middle school. There was controversy over this arrangement as different people in different parts of the Hubbard-Radcliffe district preferred grade-sharing with different districts. Residents in northern sections preferred cooperation with the Iowa Falls district, those in southern portions preferred such with the Roland-Story district, and those in the west preferred such with the South Hamilton district; those in eastern sections were satisfied with the arrangement with Eldora-New Providence. Due to the differences in opinion regarding whom to cooperate with, in 2006 about one quarter of the school-aged students living in the Hubbard-Radcliffe boundaries, about 127 in total, chose to enroll in other area school districts. Some parents preferring the South Hamilton district purchased a bus to transport their children there. Tom Barton of the WCF Courier wrote that \\"many\\" Hubbard-Radcliffe parents chose South Hamilton schools. In 2017 there was a proposal to continue the arrangement with Eldora-New Providence until 2023. This was done as other area districts had increased ties and/or consolidated altogether. Schools Prior to the grade-sharing agreement, its schools were Hubbard-Radcliffe Elementary School, Hubbard-Radcliffe Middle School, and Hubbard-Radcliffe Senior High School. They are now HR Elementary, South Hardin Middle School and South Hardin High School (along with ENP Elementary). South Hardin Middle School in Hubbard, serving both grade-sharing districts, was renovated by 2015. =South Hardin High School= *see Eldora-New Providence Community School District Operations The district has entered into multiple agreements with other school districts to share employees; Iowa school districts may share employees to save money (most commonly the superintendent). By 2014 the Hubbard- Radcliffe, GMG, and BCLUW school districts shared a single elementary guidance counselor, and Hubbard-Radcliffe and BCLUW have a single consumer sciences teacher.

Each monastery of the order is autonomous. Congregational monasteries are located in France, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Mexico, Poland, Germany, Uganda, Italy and Haiti. According to a 2011 statistic, overall 553 nuns were members of the order at the time.Annuario Pontificio, Citt√† del Vaticano 2011, p. 1489.  History  The founder of the order, Mechtilde of the Blessed Sacrament, was the superior of the Annonciades under the name of Sister Catherine of the Saint-John the Evangelist. Due to wars, the nuns had to leave their monastery. The exile roam lasted about two and a half years, and caused illness, leaving Catherine with only five nuns. Finally, in May 1638, the sisters found shelter in the Benedictine order at Rambervillers. After some time the superior of the Benedictine family of Rambervillers proposed that the sisters join their assembly, which they did. Then, Catherine took the name Mechtilde. Already then, for a long time she has had a special honor for the Eucharist. In 1653, with the help of Queen Anne of Austria, the first monastery of the new congregation was established in Paris, France. After the constitution was approved, the sisters began to make an additional vow to sustain the cult and ceaseless adoration of the Blessed Sacrament. = Poland = St. Kazimierz Church in Warsaw's New Town, Poland, part of the Benedictine Nuns of Perpetual Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament monastery in Warsaw In Poland, the first convent of Benedictine of the Most Blessed Sacrament was founded in Warsaw in 1688 by Queen Marie Casimire in recognition of the victory of Polish King's Jan III Sobieski victory over the Turks near Vienna (1683). The nuns departed from France on August 22, 1687, and arrived to Warsaw after two months of travel. Since the monastery was not yet built for them, they temporarily lived in the Royal Castle, where they started their adoration on January 1, 1688. They moved to a new monastery on June 27, 1688. The Warsaw monastery is the only foundation from the time of the founder that exists continuously in the same place, and one of ten established during the lifetime of Mother Mechtilde. During the Warsaw Uprising in 1944 the church and convent were completely destroyed, burying in its ruins 35 nuns and a high number of inhabitants of the Old Town. The second convent in Poland was established in Lviv in 1715. In 1946, it was repatriated to the Silesia, and is now located in the City of Wroc≈Çaw. The third convent in Poland, founded in 1959, is located in Siedlce, in the Podlasie area.  Activity  The nuns live according to the rules of Benedict of Nursia. The order has a contemplative character, and the center of life is the cult of the Eucharist. Depending on the monastery, the sisters bake the host, produce rosaries, icons, candles and food products. The sisters live in a strictly enclosed way, nevertheless, they may take in their circle a few people who want religious life with adoration of the Blessed Sacrament without the obligation to keep a strict enclosure. The religious costume in Poland, Italy and some of the monasteries in France consists of a black habit belted with a leather belt, a black scapular, a white bonnet surrounding the face and a black veil. On the chest there is (except for monasteries in Germany) the symbol of the Blessed Sacrament, which may look different depending on the monastery. In other countries, the religious costume may look different.

It was built in the 14th century, and served as the first residence of the duke (tavadi) family Amilakhori.  Architecture  Skhvilo castle stretches along a ridge, bordered by the ravine of Rekhula river from the west and Tiriponi valley from the east. The castle is elongated rectangular, with only a narrow entrance to the west. Relatively well preserved, it has an area of about 45 √ó 20 m, protrudes with high walls of three to four floors (about 14 m) from the ground, ending with merlons. Wooden battle trail, held on consoles, was stretching along behind. Arrowslits were on the same level.

[Zakaraya, P. Monuments of Eastern Georgia](In Russian)) On the west side there are two semicircular bastions, while on the east there are four, which emerge from the pillar-shaped wall. The only access was located on the southwest side, and getting inside was possible only by temporarily attaching a wooden ladder. In the small courtyard behind the door, there was another courtyard wall that blocked the passage to the buildings beyond. The whole structure is supported by two towers. To the north is a five-storie quadrangular tower used as a watchtower. This main tower is meant to hold the northern corner. A second tower, also quadrangular, but reduced to the height of the wall, is located on the south side of the fortress. The space between both towers is split by additional walls, and contains constructions of various age, including the residential buildings leaning against the defensive wall and a building originally used as a church. Because of limited space the church had two floors. A water reservoir, which was filled from aqueduc, is found near the church. Occasionally sappings can be observed under the walls, as well as other signs of the castle siege.  History  The history of Skhvilo castle is related to the rise of the feudal ancestors of Zevgendenidze (Amilakhvarni). In the 14th century, they first received the property, which they used as their residence. In the XVI-XVII centuries, they moved to Kvemo Chala where they built Amilakhvari castle, and Skhvilo castle only served as a fortress. In the 17th century, Iota, fortified in the castle, attacked King Rostom and defeated Amilakhvari. In the seventeenth century, it was one of the bastions of the governor of Kartli, Givi Amilakhvari, who fought against Iran's aggression. Until the end of the 18th century, Skhvilo Castle belonged to the Amilakhvarts family. It subsequently lost his former value.

After a brilliant career in the Navy as a pioneer of the A√©ronavale and having risen to the rank of Captain, he fell out of favour with the Vichy Regime for his sympathies with the Resistance. He became a leader of an intelligence network focused on the Mediterranean, and was eventually betrayed and assassinated by the Nazis, along with his wife, Lotka Leitner. Both were posthumously and jointly made Compagnons in the Ordre de la Lib√©ration.  Biography  = Youth and studies = Jacques Trolley de Pr√©vaux was born to an old family of nobility of the Robe and with a modest fortune. The family was from Normandy and had been knighted by Henri III in 1586.. Apart from a remote connections to Jean d'Arc,En 1773, une descendante de Jean d'Arc, aurait √©pous√© Pierre Trolley de Pr√©vaux, √©cuyer du roi, cf. Aude Yung-de Pr√©vaux, Un Amour dans la temp√™te de l'histoire..., ibid, p.23. the elder brother of Joan of Arc, there was no military tradition in the family. Jacques' father, Alfred Trolley de Pr√©vaux, was a professor of commercial law at the Institut catholique de Lille. Jacques' mother died in 1899, as he was 11. Trolley de Pr√©vaux studied at √âcole Saint-Joseph de Lille, proving a keen reader. Choosing a naval career, he entered the √âcole navale in 1906, ranking third out of 48 in the competitive entrance examination. He graduated 5th out of 48 in the class of 1908. He then performed the customary practical training year with a circumnavigation aboard from 1908 to 1909. Trolley de Pr√©vaux was first appointed as an Ensign to the battleship Charlemagne in Toulon in 1910. There, he acquired a taste for opium, which was a common pastime in the Navy at the time, Toulon harbouring several establishments specialised in that trade., qui cite un ouvrage que son p√®re emporte avec lui en mer : Claude Farr√®re, Fum√©e d'opium, √©d.

In April 1914, he was appointed to the flotilla Division of the 1st naval Army as second officer on the heavy torpedo boat Fanfare. = First World War = Trolley de Pr√©vaux took part in the First World War, mostly in the Mediterranean. In August 1914, he served as gunnery and manoeuver officer on the torpedo boat Chasseur; in May 1916, he transferred on Paris as aid to the chief of the naval fusilliers. In June 1916, he was appointed as second officer on gunboat Diligente. In Juin 1917, Trolley de Pr√©vaux was granted a transfer to the Naval aviation, which he had been pursuing since 1915. He trained on airships at Saint-Cyr before graduating and being promoted to Lieutenant. He then took his first command as head of the Airship base of Marquise-Rinxent in Pas-de-Calais, near Boulogne- sur-Mer, from October 1917 to November 1919.¬´ M√©moires du canton de Marquise ‚Äì La Guerre 14/18 dans le canton ‚Äì Les dirigeables √† Rinxent ¬ª , sur multimania.fr, consult√© le 4 f√©vrier 2010.¬´ Le bapt√™me du feu ‚Äì La Premi√®re Guerre mondiale ¬ª, sur postedeschoufs.com, consult√© le 4 f√©vrier 2010. He was responsible for around 100 men. As airships emerged as a powerful weapon against shipping, and as the French naval aviation was growing, reaching 700 places, 460 pilots and around 20 airships in late 1917, Pr√©vaux clocked numeroul flight hours, earning the Legion of Honour, the Croix de guerre, and a Brigade-level mention in despatches. After the Armistice, he flew over the frontlines from Nieuport to Verdun with a cameraman, filming the war-torn landscape; the film was subsequently lost, and found again in the late 1990s.Documentaire La Grande Guerre vue du ciel, de Mark Radice, diffus√©e sur la cha√Æne de t√©l√©vision RMC D√©couverte, le 11 novembre 2013, √† .. = Interwar period = From November 1919, Trolley de Pr√©vaux was given command of the Airship base at Montebourg in Manche. In February 1920, he was appointed to the Naval Ministry as staff officer to Minister Adolphe Landry, and later to Minister Gabriel Guist'hau. On 12 April 1920, Pr√©vaux married Blandine Ollivier in the 8th arrondissement of Paris. Ollivier was of high bourgeois extraction and granddaughter of Acad√©micien and Deputy √âmile Ollivier, who had served as Minister and Chief of Government under Napol√©on III between 1869 and 1870, and of Blandine Liszt.Fille a√Æn√©e de Franz Liszt et de Marie d'Agoult. The couple would sire two children. In January 1922, Pr√©vaux was appointed to command a minesweeper flotilla in Toulon, with his flag on the gunboat Diligente. In July 1923, he was promoted to Lieutenant-Commander. On 1 June 1924, he was given command of Cuers-Pierrefeu airbase in Var, which put him in charge of large zeppelin M√©diterran√©e (ex-Nordstern, transferred from Germany to France as war reparation, and sister-ship to the ill-fated Dixmude).

From 1934 to 1935, he headed Rochefort airbase. He then moved to Toulon to train at the Centre des hautes √©tudes navales and at the Institut des hautes √©tudes de d√©fense nationale, until July 1937.

In 1939, Duguay- Trouin deployed to protect shipping between the metropolitan France and the French West Africa, before transferring to the naval division of Levant. = Second World War = After the outbreak of the Second World War, at the time of the Armistice of 22 June 1940, Duguay-Trouin was in Alexandria with the rest of the Force X, under Admiral Godfroy.

In contrast to a few officers, such as d'Estienne d'Orves, whom this incident drove to join Free France, Pr√©vaux remained loyal to the Government and immediately later to the Vichy Regime. In November 1940, Pr√©vaux fell fravely ill and was rapatriated to Toulon. In July 1941, he was appointed President of the naval tribunal of Toulon. At this time, he established contacts with the R√©sistance when he came in relations with the Franco-Polish intelligence network \\"F2\\". In December 1941, his sympathies for De Gaulle and for the R√©sistsance led Admiral Darlan to dismiss him.Jean-Pierre Rioux, Vingti√®me Si√®cle. Revue d'histoire, Vol.62, No.62, 1999, p.185-186 . From early 1942, Pr√©vaux served as an informer to F2 under the nom de guerre of \\"Vox\\", along with his wife Lotka Leitner as \\"Kalo\\", providing intelligence about the German Navy. In November 1942, when the Nazis invaded the so-called Zone Libre, F2 disbanded to avoid arrests; Pr√©vaux was subsequently instrumental in reconstituting the network. British authorities bestowed him the Distinguished Service Order in 1943. He rose to head the network \\"Anne\\", which constituted the Mediterranean branch of F2, covering Marseille, Toulon, and Nice. In the course of the following year, this network provided intelligence about German naval and air units, as well as about coastal fortifications, which proved of interest for Operation Dragoon.La plaque comm√©morative √† Toulon., sur le site chemin2traverses.skyrock.com, consult√© le 4 f√©vrier 2010. On 29 March 1944, the Gestapo arrested Leitner and Pr√©vaux. They were brought to Baumettes and later to Montluc Prison in Lyon, where Pr√©vaux was tortured. He refused to talk, taking the whole of the network activities as his personal responsibility. On 19 August 1944, they were assassinated by firing squad in Bron, during one of the last executions perpretated by the Nazis before they fled Lyon.

Aside from filtering the mass-media and falsify documentations, members can also use flip phone-like device called to rid their target's memories of the Ultraman and Space Beasts. This works by suppressing a specified keyword within the target's brain, but can also be removed if they ever encounter the same incident for the second time. Despite their modus operandi helped in suppressing fear among citizens for the Space Beasts to prey upon, it also removed Nexus from his ability to strengthen himself through human bonds. Following the death of Dark Zagi, the Memory Police was disbanded as humanity slowly regained hope to confront the threat of Space Beasts. *: The leader of Memory Police, she is a realist who believes that ignorance of Space Beast was the best for the citizens.

Their original form is yet to be seen and usually took the appearance of jellyfishes in the Illustrator's room. They were originally citizens of an unnamed planet from Messier 80, who were under attacked by the Space Beasts. Inspired by Noa's heroics, they replicated the giant into Dark Zagi, but this became their undoing as Zagi went rampant and protected the Space Beasts instead. In order to stop their creation, the Visitors detonated their system's sun and their home world altogether. As they arrived on Earth, the Visitors helped in the foundation of TLT and their technologies. Through the forms of Earth jellyfish, they took residence within the Fortress Freedom's neutrino tank from which they constantly communicating with Illustrator. In aftermath of The Next's battle in Shinjuku during 2004, the Visitors deploy their creation Lethe to erase the inhabitant's memories and erecting Potential Barriers to prevent the Space Beasts from entering populated areas.

It is armed with and . Usually rode by Komon and Nagi, the latter piloted it herself when Komon received the Delta model. Before Shiori was reassigned to Gamma, she was the initial sole pilot of another Alpha model. *Beta: A small commander-use machine with greater communication and search purposes. Its purpose is to analyze the battlefield in order to carry out battle plans. It is armed with on both sides of the gyros and the on the nosecone. Its main pilot is captain Wakura, although Ishibori drove it before the Gamma model's introduction and Nagi during her training period. *Gamma: Debuted in episode 4, this model is equipped with a large metal generator, high mobility and can perform high speed flight. Its notable trait is a pair of caterpillar treads, one on each wing, and is the main component for each formation. Its armaments are a pair of and the micro missiles. Its main pilots are Shiori and Ishibori, while Nagi replaced the latter during the machine's debut. *Delta: The last of the Chester models, first appeared in episode 20 as means of independently entering Nexus' Meta Field. Its main armaments are four , each with built-in and stronger variants of Gamma's Avilock missiles. Komon is the main pilot, but Nagi boarded it in episode 31 and Wakura in the last episode. ;Chrome Chester Configurations is a combination process of the Chrome Chesters to eradicate the Space Beasts. Each combination has different components and formations: *: Created from Komon's experience in Nexus' Meta Field during the fight against Pedoleon Guros, it is the combination of Chrome Chesters Alpha, Beta, and Gamma into a fighter jet capable of entering the Meta Field. Through Gamma's , the machine possesses high speed and agility while maintaining sufficient armaments in combat. Its main weapon is the beam ray, fired to eradicate Space Beasts in conjunction with Alpha's Spider Missiles and Gamma's Avilock. *: A tank formation for land-based combat. While incredibly lacking in speed and mobility, it is compensated by the two extended from Beta's Mega Lasers, which fires the , boasting a 25% rise of output compared to the Strike Chester's Strike Banisher. *: A variation of the Strike Chester, with Chrome Chester Delta included, which appeared in episode 24. As its name implies, this machine boasts an improved performance from its predecessor, including a faster entrance into the Meta Field. Based on the data of Jun Himeya during his captivity and experimentation in Fortress Freedom, the aircraft is armed with the , a beam attack which has the same strength as Nexus Junis' Over Ray Schtrom. All three shots are made by Komon, first against Kutuura, second in a failed attempt to attack Mephisto and the last one was modified to save the weakened Nexus by firing the beam into his Energy Core. Unfortunately, the data of the Ultimate Banisher was lost when an unknown spy (Ishibori) hacked the TLT's server. Afterwards, it was replaced by during the fight against Megaflash. *: A subterranean combination of Chrome Chesters Alpha, Beta, and Gamma. This formation never made it into the series despite its existence confirmed by Tsuburaya Productions. =Other terminologies= *: A hydroelectric dam found in the mountainous Kanto region (eastern Japan) which is actually a front to the base of TLT-J. It was portrayed by the Miyagase Dam in real-life. *: The Visitor's creation, a massive memory erasing device which can render the entire population amnesiac and controlling mass-media from the information of Ultraman and Space Beast. Due to its massive size, an activation requires the power of Visitors and this cause them to be weakened. For five years, Lethe erected the in populated areas around the world, including the Fortress Freedom and the facility that held it. However, constant Beast attacks on urban area since Megaflash's arrival caused it to be weakened. In the final episode, Lethe was prepared to be launched again until Ishibori reveal himself as Zagi and provoked Nagi to transform into Nexus, causing the machine to absorb her intense hatred and Nexus' light for Zagi to return to power. Komon would dive into the darkness to save Nagi, allowing Nexus to broke free and destroy the machine. This action caused the originally repressed memories by TLT to resurface as humanity regain hope in against the Space Beast attacks. Dunamists and Ultraman Nexus The Dark Giants The were the adversaries of Ultraman Nexus, whose appearances resemble an Ultraman. Each had a human host designated as , but neither of them were counted as actual ones. Although much of their characteristic remain unknown, they emitted an opposite wavelength to Ultraman Nexus. A common ability for them is to deploy a dark pocket dimension called , which neutralizes Nexus' Meta-Field and caused disruption in radio waves. It also empowers both Dark Giants and Space Beasts alike while preventing Nexus from exerting his full power. =Dark Zagi= The is the major antagonist of ULTRA N PROJECT, as well as the final villain in Ultraman Nexus. Alternatively, he is also known as , due to his resemblance to Ultraman Noa and by TLT before his cover was blown. Dark Zagi was originally a biological weapon created by the Visitors in the likeness of Ultraman Noa as their protector from Space Beast assaults. Designated , he was equipped with a self-evolution program which allows him to counter the Space Beasts' ability to grow stronger upon predation. Unfortunately Zagi was awakened with a distorted awareness and went rogue from the revelation that he is a mere imitation of Ultraman Noa. The Visitors try to destroy their creation by self- detonating their home world, but this created a black hole which Zagi exploited to invade the Land of Light, fighting against the Space Garrisons before Noa dragged him back. After an intense battle between the two giants, Dark Zagi lost his physical body while Noa was devolved into The Next due to sealing the aforementioned black hole. Zagi arrived on Earth in 1991 as he possessed and killed the members of his research team, save for the young Nagi to plant hatred into her. In the early days of the Night Raiders, Zagi joined the group as their analyzer and bio-weapon expert to spy on Nagi's development. It was also from this point that he corrupted Mizorogi into Dark Mephisto and killing Riko as a host for Dark Faust. Four years after Beast the One's destruction, Ishibori continues to strengthen Nexus through his fight with Space Beasts while actively supporting said monsters after the deaths of his Dark Giants. During Ren's final days as a Dunamist, Ishibori created Ezmael as the final push to strengthen Nexus. As the light chose Nagi, he dropped his cover and attacked the entire TLT facility before provoking the former into Nexus and him absorbing its power. Restored to his original form, Dark Zagi marched his way on Shinjuku while facing Nexus on his forms before said hero restored to his original form, Noa, turning the tides of the battle as Dark Zagi exploded during a beam struggle on Earth's orbit. In the form of Mitsuhiko Ishibori, the Unknown Hand is capable of maintaining his human shell's youthful appearance for almost 2 decades and utilizing the skills of a hacker. He still maintain his original powers, such as remotely deploying to secure or empowering a Space Beast's regenerative factor or creating other Dark Giants. As Dark Zagi, he possessed all twisted counterparts of Ultraman Noa's techniques, including his own finisher . The lack of Noa Aegis and his color schemes are his only distinction from his rival and his mere presence can cause a simultaneous global-scale Beast attack. Mitsuhiko Ishibori/Hajime Yamaoka is portrayed by , who also voiced Dark Zagi. In a scrapped planning, the last episode would have included a fight between Noa and Zagi in outer space. =Dark Faust= is a clown-themed female Dark Giant, as well as Himeya's first adversary during his active period as Nexus. A year prior to Ultraman Nexus, Komon's kind-hearted artist girlfriend was ambushed by the Space Beast Nosferu, who killed the rest of her family members. Mizorogi killed her on the spot as Dark Faust assimilated with her to revive the girl. Since then, Riko lives a delusional life wherein her family members were still alive as Dark Faust occasionally surfaced to fight Nexus. The Dark Ultra had fought Nexus on two occasions to support the Space Beasts Bugbuzun and Lafleya. By the time Riko discovered her double life and the fact that she shared her injuries with Faust, the Dark Ultra gained full control of her body and engaged in a final fight with Nexus until Riko's consciousness resurfaced. When Nosferu attempted to kill Komon, Riko/Faust shielded him at the cost of her own before Nexus open fired with Cross-Ray Schtrom. Riko dissipated into light as Komon took a long time to recover. Dark Faust's main ability is to corrupt Nexus' Meta-Field with her Dark Field and absorb the Ultra's own light energy. Her finisher is . Dark Faust is voiced by and Riko Saida is portrayed by . The revelation of Faust's true gender as female was only highlighted in the magazine but design, voice and action wise were purposely portrayed to resemble otherwise. =Dark Mephisto= is the second Dark Giant in the series to appear and took over Faust's role in antagonizing Nexus after her demise. He is themed after the Grim Reaper, with visible motifs of rib cage and spine. His human host is , a former sub-captain of Night Raider and former accomplice of Nagi, who originally received the dream of ancient ruins that most of Nexus' Dunamists experienced. During one mission, Shinya and Nagi formed a pact to kill each other should any of them brainwashed into a Beast Human but while separated, he was contacted by Dark Mephisto, who sway Mizorogi to his side. Ever since then, Mizorogi disappeared and overseer the Space Beast attacks, including the murder of Riko Saida under his master (Unknown Hand)'s request. In the present day, Mizorogi/Mephisto try to sway Komon and Nagi to his side through various manipulation and mind games, but failed an instead delivering psychological attack to his foes, including Nexus and a young boy. He would later kidnap Himeya's colleague as a leverage for the Ultraman as he was killed by Kutuura in the Land of Dead. Before he could absorb Nexus' light to empower himself, the Night Raiders attacked him and revived the Ultra to full power. Nexus and Mephisto fought in a heated battle that ended with both sides seemingly perish. Mizorogi survived but remain amnesiac and lost his ability to become Mephisto. After being arrested by TLT to dissect the secret of an Ultra's power, Mizorogi escaped the facility with his memories returned and was shot in the back by Memory Police member Misawa, who becomes the new Mephisto. Wanting to redeem himself, Mizorogi's willpower allows him to transform for one final time into the original Dark Mephisto and grabbed his clone for Nexus Junis Blue to finish him. In his dying breath, Mizorogi apologized to Nagi and reveal that the Unknown Hand is among their ranks. Mizorogi transforms into Dark Mephisto with the naginata, which can also be used to fire vacuum bullets in human form. As Dark Mephisto, he retained the use of ESP from his human form and is armed with the from his right hand, allowing him to erect the Dark Field with on his own or exuding for melee combat. His finishing move is , which had the same strength as Nexus Junis' Over-Ray Schtrom. After his seeming demise from the final battle with Himeya, Mizorogi regains the ability to transform into Mephisto by absorbing nearby lights, signifying his redemption before death. Shinya Mizorogi is portrayed by . Dark Mephisto was originally meant to have a separate voice actor until Takeshi Yagi chooses to have Mitsutoshi's voice being altered for the Dark Ultra. =Dark Mephisto (Zwei)= is a copy of Dark Mephisto created by Unknown Hand as he possessed the Memory Police officer . Hiroyuki ambushed Mizorogi in his attempt to run from TLT's Fortress Freedom and transformed to attack Nagi, Komon and Yayoi. As he managed to overpower Nexus Junis Blue, Mizorogi joined the fray as the original Mephisto to fight his clone before giving an opening for Nexus to finish both of them. As with the original Mephisto, Misawa can transform with his own Dark Evolver. While physically identical to his predecessor, Zwei's initial black eyes turned red and displayed abilities that are superior to the original Mephisto, including , , and the ability to siphon Nexus' energy through his Energy Core. Hiroyuki Misawa is portrayed by . =Dark Lucifer= is the final Dark Giant of the ULTRA N PROJECT, who appeared in Dreams, a novel bundled with the DVD release of Ultraman Nexus in 2012. Masquerading as a retired Memory Police officer, Lucifer begins erasing his targets of their memories being attacked by Space Beasts. The Memoraser he wielded also double as his transformation item and fight against Ultraman Noa, whose bonded to both Komon and Nagi. Dark Lucifer is actually one of the unused concept as a result of Ultraman Nexus being put to an abrupt end. Its appearance is based on the Divine Comedy, with masks of Dark Faust and Mephisto on each side of his neck. The original concept was for Dark Lucifer to be Mitsuhiko Ishibori's transformed state instead of his creator, Dark Zagi. Additionally, Lucifer would have took up the role of the second last boss of the series, which was given to the combined Space Beast, Ezmael.

They are capable of growing rapidly by obtaining information and feed on the fears of intellectual life forms. Due to this, they naturally prey on human beings. Each individual emits wave from internal organs to share information, and can evolve to fight against their enemies. The Dark Giants, including Unknown Hand can manipulate then and strengthen a Space Beast with the Dark Field. Their true identity are extraterrestrial life forms that ravaged the Messier 80, the Visitors' home world. The Beast Oscillation Waves resonated with the fears of intelligent life forms which gave birth to these monsters. Although the threat of Space Beast were reduced through Noa's presence, the Visitors' anti-Beast weapon Ultinoid Zagi went rogue and enhanced the Beast, endangering their home planet once more. To erase their mistake, they try to detonate their planet to destroy both the Beasts and their creation, but said monsters were reduced to X Neutrino by Zagi's hand and fell on Earth. According to Sara Mizuhara, since the Beasts prey on human fear, their presence would be shrouded by the TLT, as massive outbreak by citizens would signify the end of the Earth. Potential Barriers were erected by the Visitors in populated area to prevent these monsters from trespassing, but continuous appearance of Megaflash, Galberos and Ezmael in Aoba New Town caused the barriers to be weakened. Furthermore, Space Beasts continued to appear even after Zagi's demise, but its threat had been significantly under control by the expanded TLT. The Space Beasts are designed by Yasushi Torisawa. As the last season Ultraman Cosmos emphasizes coexistence with monsters, the Space Beasts are incapable of coexisting with others and needed to be destroyed. Apart from that, the resemblance of Space Beasts in Nexus are also compared to Beast the One.

As a creature incapable of coexisting with humans, the Space Beasts are not treated as \\"monsters\\", but as \\"alien life forms\\". *: The first Space Beast that Noa fought on Earth as Ultraman the Next.

Another one was targeting a bus full of passengers and once a defenseless Komon was about to be eaten like the rest, Nexus crushed it with his fist. When feeding on several factory workers, the attack from Night Raiders forced the surviving members to fuse into Guros. After the first Guros' destruction, several more Kurain would march its way to a nearby tunnel to merge into another Guros within an hour. In episode 12, several Kurain appeared as illusions when Komon was under influence of a Beast cell until Himeya expelled it from the former. **: Pedoleon Guros' transformed form (see below). In the final episode, several smaller and silver-colored Furigen attacked the citizens as the A Unit of Night Raider fought them a year after Zagi's demise. **: The combined form of Pedoleon Kurain. Guros fought against Nexus Anphans and secreted kerosene gas from its back to prevent Night Raiders from firing. It assumed Furigen and try to approach the urban area but Nexus trapped it within the Meta Field halfway and destroy it.

With the ability to modify Beast Vibration Waves, they can turn themselves undetectable to Night Raiders and creating 16 disappearance cases within a week. One of them targeted Shiori's old colleagues and threw their scent before Ren intercepted it. The Unknown Hand however bath the single Brood with Dark Field G into a giant for Nexus to fight with. As the colleague still had the Bugbuzun's scent, another Brood would target her until Komon damaged its head. This caused its Beast Vibration Wave to be unmasked and allows the Night Raiders to find its source (Grolar). * **: The first monster that Himeya fought as Nexus, it was created when the nucleus from Beast the One's Beast Cell infected a dog. Galberos was summoned to an ancient ruins wherein he fought and destroy the monster for the first time.

Unfortunately Galberos was able to exploit its hypnosis to disable them while injuring Nexus' arm before disappearing. In its next reappearance, Galberos gained the advantage on Nexus due to Mizorogi's interference until Nagi fired upon him, allowing the Ultra to finish the monster once and for all. As Ren was fighting against Megaflash, a second Galberos was summoned to assist the nautilus Space Beast until it became the receiving end of Schtrom Sword.

When Riko's consciousness awoke, she used Faust's body to shield Komon from the monster's own claws, allowing Nexus to defeat Nosferu with Cross Ray Schtrom while Riko passed away from her injuries. Nosferu however revived itself and assaulted the Yamamura family to turn the parents into Beast Humans, which led to their daughter Riko held hostage within Nosferu's forehead. As part of Mizorogi's twisted game, Nosferu was killed by the Night Raiders' Chrome Chester with Riko still inside while Nexus was pre-occupied with Dark Mephisto. However, Nosferu was revived as its original 5 meter form and attacked a factory and its workers while Komon's hesitation allow it to escape. Somewhere nearby Negoro's secret base, Nosferu grew giant to intercept the Night Raiders. With Nexus' help, the regenerative organ was exposed long enough for Komon to open fire, allowing Nexus Junis to finish it with Over Ray Schtrom. **: A marine life-themed Space Beast with appearance based on Edvard Munch's The Scream. Kutuura's original location is the and utilized dimensional portals to create six cases of disappearances under Mizorogi's request to lure the Night Raider.

Having escaped Nexus and the Chrome Chesters after feeding on some hikers, Golgolem fell in a trap set by TLT to destroy its crystals, causing it to become vulnerable. However, the operation was interrupted due to Horokusa and his crew's involvement as Golgolem devour Horokusa and forced the Night Raider to retreat upon the regeneration of its crystals. With the Chrome Chester Delta, Komon managed to enter the same phase as Golgolem to bring it into the real world while the Mega Cannon Chester fired their attacks.

Names Dabasun Nor is a romanization of the lake's Mongolian name, which means simply \\"Salt Lake\\". The same name also appears as Da-ba-sun Nor, Dabasun-Nor, Dabsoun Nor,. and Dabsoun-Noor.. The name was calqued into Chinese as (D√†y√°n H«éizi), \\"the Great Salt Lake\\". It was also known to foreign geographers as Charamannai Nor, Kara-Manna√Ø-Omo, Karamanni Omo, Hara Manlay Nuur, and Dalay Dabasun, the last meaning \\"Sea\\" or \\"Ocean of Salt\\", although these names were unknown to locals by the 20th century. Geography In the 1840s, the lake was reckoned as about 20 lis (about ) in circumference. As late as the mid-1950s, Dabasun Nor was reckoned as usually long and wide, with an expansive salt marsh to its east. After a rain, its depth could reach as much as . Its former bed lies about above sea level.. The area surrounding the lake was once so saturated with salt and natron as to glow white and was scattered with thorn-covered yardangs. The aridity and salinity precluded almost any trees from growing. History Przhevalsky recorded the local tradition that the burial place of Genghis Khan was found by traveling about south of Dabasun Nor. In the 1840s, Huc and Gabet followed a caravan route south of the lake. The few freshwater springs that occurred were marked at the time by long poles, each topped with a small flag. Their journey came just a decade after Tao Zhu's liberalization of the imperial salt monopoly, and Huc reported that the lake's salt trade had become so extensive as to supply several nearby provinces. This made the area economically important for trade and popular as a destination along caravan routes, but did little to help locals for whom the salt was nearly worthless. The salinity of the ground also kept them from growing any crops or keeping cattle, although camels and sheep were able to thrive on the local thorny vegetation.. Wild lizards, deer, and rabbits were also abundant into the 20th century. The lake was still exporting large quantities of salt into the 1930s, but by the early 20th century the revenue was being kept by the local Mongol lord at Hanggin and its reduced economic importance meant that most trade followed the Yellow River around the curve of the Ordos, only bothering with crossing directly across the desert when summer flooding made the river valley impractical.

Perched on a promontory at the confluence of the Mashavera and Pinezauri rivers, the site is an open-air museum, containing the early medieval Dmanisi Sioni cathedral and the ruins of one of the most important towns and commercial centres in medieval Georgia, with fortifications, churches, Muslim and Christian cemeteries, bathhouses, and workshops. A palaeoarchaeological site at Dmanisi, unearthed under the medieval layers, has yielded a set of hominin fossils, dated to approximately , one of the earliest unequivocal evidence for presence of the genus Homo outside the African continent. History =Early history and Muslim rule = The Dmanisi site was once settled by one of the largest and richest towns in medieval Georgia. The toponym \\"Dmanisi\\" is explained by the 18th-century Georgian scholar Prince Vakhushti as being derived from the Old Georgian daba, \\"a hamlet\\". Dmanisi emerged from a small settlement around an episcopal see, with the jurisdiction over the Dmaniskhevi (Mashavera) and Ktsia valleys and already known among the six dioceses of Kartli in the 6th century, to a major commercial town in the 9th‚Äì10th century, when the area was under the Arab rule. According to the medieval Georgian chronicles, the caliph's commander Bugha al-Kabir settled 100 Alan households from the Darialan at Dmanisi during his campaign in Kartli in 853. In 989, Dmanisi was conquered by the Armenian king David I of Lori, but the town then appears to have reverted to a Muslim control. The Georgian chronicles make mention of the certain Sitlarabi, apparently the corrupted name of Sayyid al-'Arab, a Muslim from Dmanisi who was installed by King Bagrat IV of Georgia as his vassal emir at Tiflis in 1068. An unnamed \\"emir of Dmanisi\\" is known to have supported the Seljuq commander Sau-tegin Sarhang al-Khass‚Äî\\"Sarang Alkhazi\\" of the Georgian sources‚Äîagainst King George II of Georgia in 1073. = Kingdom of Georgia = Sioni cathedral at Dmanisi. Ruins of the town walls. Church of St. Marina. Threatened by the resurgent Georgian monarchy, the Muslim oligarchy of Dmanisi joined the appeal of Ganja and Tiflis to the Seljuq sultan Mahmud II against the encroachments from David IV of Georgia in 1121. David captured Dmanisi in March 1123, but his son Demetrius I had to reconquer the town in 1125. Under the Kingdom of Georgia, Dmanisi continued to prosper; crafts and trade flourished. According to Yaqut al-Hamawi, the town exported silk. Dmanisi's vibrant economic history is evidenced by more than 800 coins, mostly foreign, found in the area as well as the archaeological artifacts such as imported Iranian fa√Øence and Chinese celadon and locally produced pottery, glassware, and jewelry. The population of medieval Dmanisi was heterogeneous. Muslims constituted the single largest group in the town as indicated by a sizable cemetery, with the 13th‚Äì14th-century Arabic inscriptions, which numerically surpass the extant Christian‚ÄîGeorgian and Armenian‚Äîtombstones. Some Muslims left after the Georgian takeover: a sheikh named Sadr ad-Din Hamid b. Ali ad-Damanisi (died 1245) operated a madrasa in Damascus. The position of emir was now reduced to that of an appointed royal official: an early 13th-century stone inscription in Georgian from a small ruined chapel in Dmanisi mentions George IV's contemporary emir Job, son of Mikhrik, who had erected a cross-stone in the name of St. Demetrius. When Georgia became a vassal to the Mongol Empire, Dmanisi was chosen for producing coinage: a copper type was minted in the name of David VI of Georgia in 1245. In the 1270s, Demetrius II of Georgia was constrained to make Dmanisi and the surrounding district over to his powerful minister Sadun, who had the confidence of the Mongols. King David VIII, being on good terms with the Mongol khan Baydu, was able to retrieve Dmanisi in 1293, but subsequently lost it to his rival brother, Vakhtang III, who was buried in the town on his death in 1308. Dmanisi then passed in possession of Vakhtang's elder son, Demetrius. = Downfall = Timur's invasions of Georgia between 1386 and 1403 brought Dmanisi's heyday to an end. In 1486, the town was devastated in an attack by Yaqub bin Uzun Hasan, the ruler of Aq Qoyunlu. After the final disintegration of the Kingdom of Georgia in the 1490s, it became part of the Kingdom of Kartli. Dmanisi was then granted by the crown to the Baratashvili family, whose two lines divided all of the town and its premises in 1536. Dmanisi was occupied and refortified by the Ottoman troops in 1578, but recovered by King Simon I of Kartli in 1583. Afterwards, Dmanisi was little more than a military outpost owned by the Baratashvili. A modest revival of economic and ecclesiastic life at Dmanisi, then also known as Dbanisi, in the early 18th century proved to be short-lived. Dmanisi's downfall in a renewed warfare and political anarchy was followed by the dissolution of its episcopal see in the middle of the 18th century; the area became largely depopulated until new rural settlements began to emerge around the former town already under the Imperial Russian rule over Georgia in the early 19th century. One of these, Bashkicheti, was renamed into Dmanisi after the historical town in 1947.  Research  Archaeological digs in 2007. In 1853, the ruins at Dmanisi were first visited and briefly described by Colonel Ivan Bartolomei and Prince Dimitri Orbeliani. Some of the Georgian inscriptions copied by these men were published by the French scholar Marie-F√©licit√© Brosset in 1854. Ekvtime Taqaishvili oversaw some digs at the Dmanisi necropolis and republished Georgian inscriptions in 1894. Archaeological exploration of the ruins began in 1936, but systematic excavations were not undertaken until the 1980s. In the process it became apparent that medieval pits or cellars had been dug into sand and ash deposits containing prehistoric animal bones and stone tools. In 1991 a human jaw and teeth showing anatomical similarities to Homo erectus were unearthed, followed by the landmark discovery of a series of skulls between 1991 and 2005. Dated to approximately , these finds made Dmanisi one of the most ancient human habitation sites anywhere in Eurasia. In 2007, the Dmanisi Hominid Archaeological Site was added on the Tentative List of UNESCO World Heritage Centre.  Site  A copper coin of King David VI of Georgia stuck at Dmanisi in 1245. A wine jar, kvevri, buried sometime between the 15th and 18th centuries. The Dmanisi historic site consists of two major parts comprising the remains of a settlement, its fortifications, churches, cemeteries, and other structures. One part is the proper town, occupying an area of 13 ha on a promontory at the confluence of the Mashavera and Pinezauri rivers, and the other one is an adjoining suburb, covering 12 ha along the Pinezauri river. = Proper town = The town was defended by a basalt wall, forming a great rampart and fortified with buttresses, on the east and by the Mashavera valley on the north and northwest, going to the depth of 90 metres here. The southern part of the promontory was occupied by a citadel, of about 3,250 square metres. It was located inside the town wall, separated from the town by a special rampart which contains the only gate. The citadel contained a palace, bathhouse, and other structures. To the west, a 200 m-long clandestine tunnel, largely preserved to this day, led to the Mashavera river. A road from the south entered the town through a gate. Its continuation and streets within the town were about 2,5 metre-wide, paved with large stone slabs, and edged by a low stone wall. Houses in Dmanisi were built of irregular lines of basal stones, with brick fireplaces and niches, inner walls plastered and, in case of richer houses, covered with green ceramic tiles. In the ruined town's centre, just below the citadel, stands Dmanisi's cathedral church of Sioni, an early medieval basilica with a three-bay nave and apse, and a richly adorned narthex added in the early 13th century. North of it, there is a small single-nave church of St. Marina, rebuilt in 1702, as revealed by a Georgian inscription above its southern portal. Farther to the northeast, there are ruins of two other small churches, which contain stones with Armenian inscriptions. = Suburb = The suburb was located south of the proper town. It contained an extensive 12th‚Äì14th-century cemetery, nearly as large as the town itself, consisting of Christian‚ÄîGeorgian and Armenian‚Äîand larger, Muslim sections. Ruins of a small single-nave church survive in the Christian cemetery. Along the right bank of the Pinezauri, there are ruins of three bathhouses. = Museum = The Dmanisi site is an open-air museum, administered as part of the Georgian National Museum as the Dmanisi Historic and Architectural Museum-Reserve. The museum also contains an exhibition hall, displaying more than 2300 artifacts. The Dmanisi museum operates seasonally, from May to October. The Dmanisi Sioni cathedral and other structures in the site were inscribed on the list of the Immovable Cultural Monuments of National Significance in 2007.

It stars Pubudu Chathuranga, Dasun Pathirana and Isuru Lokuhettiarachchi in lead roles along with Chamathka Lakmini and Anjana Premaratne. Music composed by Keshan Perera. The film is a remake of 2015 Spanish film The Corpse of Anna Fritz.  Plot  Kumara (played by Dasun) works as an orderly at a hospital, a job that gives him the opportunity to watch the bodies of young women that are brought to the hospital's morgue. One day he is stunned when the body of a beautiful and desirable actress, Tharuka Wijesinghe (played by Chamathka) arrives. Kumara cannot resist taking a picture. Meanwhile, two of his friends Ruwan (played by Isuru) and Namal (played by Pubudu) arrives to the hospital for having a drink with Kumara. Then Kumara showed the photo of Tharuka and they went morgue to view Tharuka's nude body. Ruwan asked if it is possible to rape a corpse and Kumara replies that saliva must be used for lubrication. When asked whether he knows this from past experience, Kumara confesses he has raped the corpse of a teen girl and showed photos. Ruwan soon decides that he wants to rape Tharuka's corpse and begins raping it, prompting Kumara to suggest that he take a turn after Ruwan. Namal is disgusted when they suggest he takes a turn and refuses. During Kumara's act of necrophilia, Tharuka suddenly returns to life and opens her eyes. She cannot move, but her eyes are open in terror. Kumara screams when he realizes this and the others come into the room. The men are then faced with two choices: They can either report Tharuka's revival and face rape charges, as there was no way Tharuka could have consented to sex, or they can murder her and cover up their crimes. While Kumara and Ruwan both want to hide their crime, Namal pushes for them to save Tharuka and take responsibility for what they have done. The three men argue and Ruwan unintentionally kills Namal. Without Namal to stop them, Ruwan is set on killing Tharuka. Ruwan convinces Kumara that he would be an accessory to the murder of Namal, and that there is no way Tharuka would stay silent if she is left alive. They decide to smother her with bunched up sheets so no mark is left on her body. While Ruwan disposes of the evidence, Kumara cleans Tharuka's body and covers her in a white sheet. As he is about to leave, Kumara tells Tharuka to pretend she is dead and it is revealed that he faked the murder. Ruwan returns and they both leave the room. As they are about to get on the elevator, Ruwan checks his wallet and realizes he forgot his card in the morgue. Kumara unsuccessfully tries to convince him to leave rather than get his card, saying he will pick it up the next day however Ruwan opens the door to see Tharuka putting on a hospital wear. Ruwan furiously starts to punish Kumara, accusing him of conspiring to blame all of it on him. He finally stops, announcing that he does not care anymore if Kumara wants to go to jail. Tharuka sneaks up behind him and stabs him twice. He bleeds to death from the wound in his neck. Meanwhile, Kumara cries, saying that Ruwan had already said he would leave. Silent, Tharuka repeatedly stabs Kumara. Tharuka is then seen staring off with tears in her eyes and blood spatter on her face.

Later, at the end of the 8th century - the beginning of the 9th century, the dome of the church of Kvelazminda (All Saints) was built. The church is built of stone and brick. Kvelazminda refers to the transition period of Georgian architecture (VIII - X) and is one of the most significant and highly artistic monuments.

It was built by an independent company to connect Wainfleet, at first, and then the seaside town of Skegness, with the main line network at Firsby. It opened in 1871 from Firsby to Wainfleet, and 1873 throughout. With the development of Skegness as a seaside holiday and excursion destination, the line increased in usage in the latter decades of the nineteenth century, and retained its popularity in most of the twentieth. In 1970 the main line at Firsby was closed north of the junction for Skegness, and the branch is now connected by the residual part of the main line from Boston. Although British seaside holidays have declined in popularity, Skegness as a resort, and the branch line remain in heavy use. A publicity poster for Skegness as a holiday destination was published by the Great Northern Railway in 1908, and caught the public imagination; it is still familiar today. Billy Butlin established his first holiday camp, Butlins, at Skegness in 1936, attracting much business to the line. The branch line is open at the present day, although the connection to the former main line at Firsby faces towards Boston, by-passing the original junction. Origins The Firsby to Wainfleet line in 1871The East Lincolnshire Line had been opened by the Great Northern Railway in 1848; it ran from Boston to Grimsby by way of Firsby and Louth. Wainfleet All Saints was an ancient river port, consisting of a quay alongside the Steeping River, known locally as Wainfleet Haven. Leleux says that it was a \\"decayed port and stagnating market town of 1,355 inhabitants\\" in 1871.Robin Leleux, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 9: The East Midlands, David and Charles (Publishers) Limited, Newton Abbot, 1976, , page 204 A public meeting held on 7 August 1868 agreed that a railway branch line from Firsby to Skegness was desirable. However by the time of the deposition of plans in November, this had been limited to a line from Firsby to Wainfleet.Stephen Walker, Firsby to Wainfleet and Skegness, KMS Books, Boston, 1987, , page 7 Authorisation to Wainfleet, and opening Wainfleet railway stationThe Wainfleet and Firsby Railway was authorised by an Act of 13 May 1869;Donald J Grant, Directory of the Railway Companies of Great Britain, Matador Publishers, Kibworth Beauchamp, 2017, , page 580 Authorised share capital was ¬£18,000, and the line was to be 4 miles 22 chains in length. As a small local branch line connected to the Great Northern Railway (at Firsby) the concern was likely to be dependent on the GNR. However the GNR had had bad experiences in the past in similar situations, and it declined to offer any financial help to the Wainfleet line, although it did carry ballast for it free of charge during the construction stages.John Wrottesley, The Great Northern Railway: volume II: Expansion and Competition, B T Batsford Limited, London, 1979, , page 3 The line was laid with 73 lb rails; there were five level crossings and no bridges. The Skegness branch in 1881Goods traffic began on 11 September 1871; on 18 October Col Hutchinson of the Board of Trade visited the line and approved it for passenger train operation. Passenger trains started running on 24 October 1871. There were eight trains each way on weekdays only, and the single line was operated by train staff. Passengers for Skegness completed their journey from Wainfleet by horse-buses and wagons. Rent was charged to the Wainfleet company for the use of the GNR station at Firsby at ¬£50 per annum; at first the GNR worked the line for 60% of the receipts.Walker, page 8 On to Skegness Skegness stationSkegness was rising in importance, and stopping short at Wainfleet was hardly logical, so the Wainfleet and Firsby Railway Company obtained an Act on 18 July 1872 to extend its line to Skegness. The extension was constituted as a separate entity for shareholding purposes; ¬£27,000 in new share capital was authorised by the Act. The single line made an end-on junction at Wainfleet, and was 5 miles 2 chains in length. The train service was extended from Wainfleet to Skegness for general traffic on 28 July 1873. On summer Sundays one train was run each way. The GNR now worked the line for 50% of the receipts. A large sum was expended on constructing a commodious Skegness station.Wrottesley, volume 2, page 26Charles H Grinling, History of the Great Northern Railway, 1845 ‚Äì 1895, Methuen and Co, London, 1898Walker, page 13 Heavy holiday traffic Thorpe Culvert railway stationSkegness proved a very popular seaside resort, and the branch generated a considerable revenue from excursion traffic. About 220,000 excursion passengers were brought to and from Skegness, from Nottingham, Yorkshire, and London in 1878.Grinling, page 336 At the half-yearly shareholders' meeting later in 1878, the General Manager of the GNR company referred to an exceptionally busy day when many passengers were unable to get home promptly, saying, \\"We were overtaken by the traffic upon that day, and, though we got the people to Skegness all right, we could not get them away like clock-work. It is single line part of the way.\\"Grinling, page 359 The junction for the branch at Firsby faced Grimsby, so all the excursion trains had to reverse there. A south curve, enabling through running to and from the south, had been authorised in 1874 but the work did not proceed at first. The scheme was revived in 1881, and the Board of Trade inspector approved it for passenger operation on 24 May 1881. Signal boxes for the new junctions were built at Firsby South and East. Construction of the curve was retrospectively authorised by an Act on 18 Jul 1881.Wrottesley, volume 2, page 93Walker, page 28 The junction with the East Coast Main Line at Barkston (then spelt Barkstone) faced south, and this too was inconvenient for any Skegness traffic coming from the north. A new north curve was opened on 29 March 1882, (authorised after the event by an Act on 19 August 1882). It was double track. The GNR proposed doubling the line from Firsby to Skegness but the Wainfleet and Firsby Railway company, still owner of the line, was not prepared to find the money, and suggested that the GNR could purchase the line. The W&FR; was paying a handsome dividend of % at the time, and suggested that the GNR should pay ¬£25 for every ¬£10 share. This was more than the GNR was prepared to pay, so some limited improvements were carried out at W&FR; expense. A 470-yard long passing place was installed at Wainfleet. The line was doubled for miles from Cowbank to Skegness, and the terminus was re-signalled and the platforms extended.Wrottesley, volume 2, page 94 More infrastructure enhancements The working agreement between the GNR and the W&FR; was due to expire in August 1895. The GNR offered to buy the Company at ¬£15 per share, and in November after some negotiation, terms were agreed at ¬£17 for each of the Wainfleet Company's ¬£10 shares, of which there were 4,500. By an act of 30 May 1895, the GNR absorbed the smaller company as from 1 January 1896,Grant and Walker say 1 January 1896; Wrottesley says 1 July 1896. Carter says 31 December 1895. at the price of ¬£76,500. Now that the line was its own, the GNR obtained powers on 25 July 1898 to double the line. Doubling was in hand by May 1899; it reached Thorpe Culvert on 9 July, Wainfleet soon afterwards, and it was completed in June 1900 in time for the summer traffic. Skegness station was provided with another island platform.John Wrottesley, The Great Northern Railway: volume III: Twentieth Century to Grouping, B T Batsford Limited, London, 1981, , pages 52 and 53Walker, page 56Ernest F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959 Train service Nine trains each way ran between Firsby and Skegness in 1878, then six daily in 1889, and eleven in December 1938.Vic Mitchell and Keith Smith, Branch lines to Skegness and Mablethorpe, also to Spilsby and Coningsby, Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2016 Publicity Poster: Skegness is So Bracing by John HassallIn the early part of the twentieth century, the GNR ran cheap excursions to seaside towns. Skegness had been popular with Midlands excursionists, but had not attracted Londoners. In an attempt to change that, the GNR ran a series of day excursions in the summer of 1905, coupling them with heavy publicity. The trains often ran on Sunday, usually from King's Cross. They were a considerable success, and on August Bank Holiday 1905, six trains were required. The GNR further encouraged the business, and in 1908 the GNR published a poster of a burly fisherman capering along the sands, proclaiming 'Skegness is so bracing,'; the image caught the public imagination, and caused a sensation. The GNR purchased the painting from the artist, John Hassall for ¬£12; the transaction took place on 13 February 1908. The GNR added to the painting the words \\"Skegness is so bracing\\" and it was first used to advertise a trip from London King's Cross to Skegness on Good Friday 17 April 1908. The trip cost 3/-, and the train left King's Cross at 11.30 am. Even today \\"the Jolly Fisherman\\" is still proudly used by the resort in its advertising and the original painting hangs in the Town Hall at Skegness.Walker wrote this in 1987.Walker, page 32 Later there was a painting of a scene from Charley's Aunt (from the well-known play), on the sands at Skegness, announcing that excursions were \\"still running\\".Wrottesley, volume 3, page 93 Better train services Skegness Council approached the GNR in November 1910 to ask for a better holiday train service Manchester, Birmingham, and Leeds, suggesting a new line to shorten the distance. The GNR suggested an alternative new line, which became the Kirkstead and Little Steeping Railway, and promised improved services. In the summer, the Leeds train came five days a week (including Sundays) there were Manchester through carriages (attached to the Yarmouth train between Retford and Sleaford) and Lincoln trains reversing at Boston.Wrottesley, volume 3, page 113 The new line consisted of 15 miles of double track; it opened for passenger and goods traffic on 1 August 1913. In summer, through carriages from Manchester and Sheffield, and the Leeds train diverted to the new route.Wrottesley, volume 3, page 131 Butlins Holiday Camp In 1936 Butlin's Holiday Camp was opened at Skegness. It became a good revenue earner for the railway and Saturdays were particularly busy at Skegness Station. Road transport was laid on from Skegness station to and from the Camp. During World War II the Camp was taken over by the Royal Navy and re-named HMS Royal Arthur. It was used to train new recruits.Walker, page 34Derek Tait, An Illustrated History of Butlins, Amberley Books, Stroud, 2012, 1950s Up to forty holiday trains arrived from Leicester, Nottingham, Derby, Birmingham and London on summer Saturdays in 1955, so the 24 carriage sidings were well used.Paul Anderson, Railways of Lincolnshire, Irwell Press, Oldham, 1992, , page 65 Diesels Diesel traction was introduced into Lincolnshire in 1955 and by 1959 the whole branch passenger services were taken over by the DMU's.Walker, page 21 Paytrains The paytrain (conductor-guard) system was introduced on the branch from 7 October 1968. Station ticket offices were closed and passengers obtained tickets on the trains.Walker, page 26 East Lincolnshire Line closed On 5 October 1970 the East Lincolnshire Line was closed between Grimsby and Firsby, inclusive.Walker, page 27 Restricted hours To limit expenditure on signallers' and crossing keepers' wages, Skegness train operation was restricted to a single ten-hour shift from October 1977; buses provided early morning and late evening connections with Boston. However, British Rail and Lincolnshire County Council embarked on a jointly funded venture to provide automatic barriers at level crossings. The full timetable was restored during 1989 and in 1992 there were 16 trains each way on the branch. Current train service The Skegness branch continues in passenger use at the present (2019) with an approximately hourly service to and from Nottingham.East Midlands Trains printed timetable Station List * Firsby; opened 3 September 1848; closed 5 October 1970; * Thorpe Culvert; opened 24 October 1871; still open; * Wainfleet; opened 24 October 1871; still open; * Croft Bank; opened 28 July 1873; renamed Havenhouse 1900; still open; * Cow Bank; opened 28 July 1873; renamed Seacroft 1900; closed 7 December 1953; * Skegness; opened 28 July 1873; still open.

The Oakland Buddha is a statue of a Buddha placed in a traffic median in Oakland, California in 1999. The statue was placed by neighborhood resident Dan Stevenson who was upset about the frequent use of the median for illegal dumping. Stevenson attached the statue to the median using epoxy and rebar to deter theft of the figure. The city's Public Works Department initially stated that it would remove the statue after receiving a complaint about it, but backed off its plans to do so after receiving substantial opposition. After its installation, local Vietnamese residents made the statue into a Buddhist shrine for daily worship services. Following the installation of the statue and its conversion into a shrine, Oakland police stated that criminal activity in the area, including dumping, graffiti, drug dealing, and prostitution, had dropped by 82% as of 2014. Statue installation Stevenson first installed the statue in 1999, after becoming frustrated with large amounts of illegal dumping on a newly constructed traffic median at the intersection of East 19th Street and 11th Avenue in Oakland, California, and the failure of city government to meaningfully correct the problem. While he frequently contacted the city's public works department about the problem, the dumping continued unabated. Though not a Buddhist, Stevenson stated that he believed Buddha to be a neutral and uncontroversial figure who might cause those considering dumping to think twice. During initial installation, Stevenson decided to install the statue with rebar and epoxy to deter theft. An attempt at theft was made shortly after the figure was installed, but the reinforced mounting resulted in the would-be thief being unable to remove the statue. Use as Buddhist shrine Offerings left at the shrine by worshippers Approximately four months after installation, Stevenson noticed that the figure had been painted white. In 2010, local Vietnamese residents became aware of the statue, and decided to convert it into a Buddhist shrine. The residents cleaned, repainted, and decorated the statue, built a wooden structure for its protection, and began to leave offerings such as flowers and fresh fruit, as well as to use the statue as a meeting place for worship. The shrine is now used as a daily meeting space for prayers, and an additional statue of the Buddhist icon of compassion Guanyin was installed by worshippers. Removal attempt by city In 2012, the Oakland Public Works Department stated that it had received complaints about the presence of the Buddha and shrine, and would remove it from the median. City officials stated that it represented a \\"safety issue\\" as it was located in a road median and that some neighbors were unhappy with early morning noise from worshippers. After receiving substantial opposition from neighborhood residents and worshippers who use the shrine, the city announced that it would \\"table\\" the issue, and as of 2020 has not made further attempts at removing either the statue or shrine. Effects The Oakland Buddha has been featured on episodes of the Criminal and 99% Invisible podcasts. During the second time featured on Criminal, the show producer noted that the episode was one of the most popular that the series had made. The Oakland Police Department stated that since the statue was made into a shrine and daily worship began in 2012, crime had fallen in the neighborhood by 82% by 2014, though Oakland PD noted that they could not definitively state that the shrine is the cause. Stevenson stated that he receives visits both from worshippers at the shrine, who sometimes offer him gifts, and by tourists curious about it.

Explanation and application  A fuzzy bit may be an unwanted side effect of a defective storage medium or reader, but can also be a deliberately generated effect. For example, in the 1980's and 1990's, with magnetic media such as floppy disks such bits were deliberately created by poor formatting to serve as a copy protection mechanism. An example of this is the game Dungeon Master, in which inconsistency in multiple read access to such a bit was checked when loading the software and was a prerequisite for operation. Since usual floppy disk drives could not produce such bits, this was an effective mechanism for preventing illegal copies and one of the only possible approaches to circumvent such protection was to disable the check routine in the software.

Biography Schreiber was born to a Hasidic Jewish family in London. He moved to New York City and in 2000 - with the help of his family and private investors - purchased residential real estate in Brooklyn, upstate New York, and New Jersey. In 2004, he sold most of the residential portfolio to concentrate on commercial properties in Manhattan. In 2006, he founded Waterbridge Capital as a vehicle for his investments. Waterbridge generally leaves the development of properties to its partners and focuses on raising capital and finding partners. His first major investment was the $190 million purchase of 536 Broadway in 2007. In 2010, he purchased a 33-percent interest in WeWork (founded by Adam Neumann and Miguel McKelvey) for $15 million after meeting the founders who were inquiring about a potential lease. McKelvey stated that the deal was a pivotal moment for the company. In 2012, he partnered with Ben Bernstein and Ben Stokes of RedSky Capital and purchased a group of properties for $66 million on Bedford Avenue in Williamsburg, Brooklyn; they redeveloped the real estate and subsequently signed Apple to a 20,000-square-foot retail lease. In 2012, Schreiber partnered with Brooklyn real estate investor David Werner and purchased One Court Square for $481 million in Long Island City, Queens from Stephen L.

The regiment was captured at Fort Donelson in 1862 and sent to Northern prison camps. After the survivors were exchanged and new recruits added, the regiment was reconstituted and fought at Raymond, Jackson, Chickamauga, Missionary Ridge, and Ringgold Gap in 1863. The unit served in the Atlanta Campaign and at Franklin, Nashville, Averasborough, and Bentonville in 1864‚Äì1865. The regiment's 65 survivors surrendered to William Tecumseh Sherman's Federal forces on 26 April 1865. History =Formation= In 1861, John Gregg, a district judge from Fairfield, Texas was appointed colonel with authority to raise an infantry regiment. On 2 October 1861, nine companies were formed into a regiment at Marshall, Texas. The district attorney of Harrison County, Jeremiah M. Clough became lieutenant colonel and the chief justice of McLennan County, Hiram B. Granbury became major. The new regiment rode a train to Shreveport, Louisiana and marched from there to Memphis, Tennessee. It was mustered into the Confederate States Army on 10 November 1861 at Hopkinsville, Kentucky. Between that date and February 1862, 130 soldiers died of disease at camp. =1862= On 9 February 1862, the 7th Texas marched to Clarksville, Tennessee and from there to Fort Donelson on 13 February. The 7th was the only one of the 28 Confederate infantry regiments in the garrison from Texas. The 7th Texas formed part of a brigade commanded by Colonel T. J. Davidson, which also included the 8th Kentucky Infantry, 1st Mississippi Infantry, and 3rd Mississippi Infantry. During the Battle of Fort Donelson on 15 February, the brigade sustained losses of 68 killed and 218 wounded. During the fighting, the 7th Texas lost 20 killed, including Clough, and 40 wounded. On 16 February, the garrison of Fort Donelson surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant's Union army. Some soldiers of the 7th Texas avoided capture and later joined Terry's Texas Rangers or the 9th Texas Infantry Regiment. Nevertheless, over 300 men from the regiment were shipped to Federal prison camps where 65 men died. On 16 September 1862, the soldiers of the 7th Texas were exchanged at Vicksburg, Mississippi. There were so few remaining men that they were temporarily consolidated with the 49th and 55th Tennessee Infantry Regiments, which were also captured at Fort Donelson. Gregg received promotion to brigadier general, effective 29 August 1862, and Granbury replaced Gregg as colonel. William L. Moody, a businessman from Fairfield, became lieutenant colonel and Khleber M. Van Zandt, a lawyer from Marshall, became major. =1863‚Äì1865= In January and February 1863, so many recruits from Texas arrived that the 7th Texas resumed its individual identity. The regiment was assigned to Gregg's brigade and fought in the Battle of Raymond on 12 May 1863. Gregg's brigade consisted of the 7th Texas, 1st Tennessee Battalion, 3rd, 10th/30th (consolidated), 41st, and 50th Tennessee Regiments, and Hiram Bledsoe's Missouri Battery. At Raymond, the brigade suffered losses of 73 killed, 251 wounded, and 190 missing, or 514 total casualties. The Union forces sustained 442 casualties. At Raymond, Gregg with only one brigade unwittingly courted battle with an entire Union corps under James B. McPherson. The Federals deployed two brigades and advanced into the dense vegetation bordering Fourteen Mile Creek. Not realizing he was facing a corps, Gregg aggressively decided to attack frontally with the 7th Texas and 3rd Tennessee while sending the 10th/30th and 50th Tennessee to hit the Union right flank. The Texans attacked the 20th Ohio Infantry and the Federal unit only held its ground because its division commander John A. Logan personally rallied it. A second Union division arrived on the field and the 7th Texas faced three Federal regiments before being compelled to withdraw. The 7th Texas lost 22 killed, 66 wounded, and 70 captured out of a total strength of 305 men. Sugg's brigade is shown attacking Horseshoe Ridge late on the second day of the Battle of Chickamauga. Gregg's brigade fought in the Battle of Jackson, Mississippi on 14 May 1863. Moody was badly wounded in July near Jackson, Mississippi and never returned to the regiment. The 7th Texas fought at the Battle of Chickamauga on 19‚Äì20 September, losing eight killed, 78 wounded, and one captured out of 177 men. Gregg's brigade, which formed part of Bushrod Johnson's division, suffered 109 killed, 474 wounded, and 18 missing, a total of 601 casualties. On the first day, Gregg's brigade became involved in a see-saw musketry duel with Hans Christian Heg's Federal brigade. Later, as Gregg's regiments were moving through the forest, they bumped into Charles Garrison Harker's Union brigade. In heavy woods, Gregg inadvertently rode into a Federal skirmish line and was shot down. After the skirmishers took his sword and spurs, some men from the nearby Texas Brigade rescued the unconscious general. Cyrus Sugg took command of Gregg's brigade. On the second day, James Longstreet placed Johnson's division at the forefront of his heavy column of attack. The 7th Texas formed the left flank of Johnson's first line. By an astonishing blunder, the opposing Union troops marched away, leaving a hole in their line. Johnson's division advanced into the gap, beginning the rout of the Union right wing. Later, when Sugg's brigade was striking toward the Union rear at Horseshoe Ridge, James B. Steedman's Union division fortuitously appeared and repulsed the Confederate attacks. Hiram B. Granbury Before the Battle of Missionary Ridge on 25 November 1863, there was a reorganization that assigned the 7th Texas to James Argyle Smith's brigade in Patrick Cleburne's division. The other units in Smith's brigade were the consolidated 6th Texas and 10th Texas Infantry, and 15th Texas Cavalry Regiments, and the consolidated 17th Texas, 18th Texas, 24th Texas, and 25th Texas Cavalry Regiments. All cavalry units were dismounted. Smith's brigade counted about 1,300 men and was deployed to defend Tunnel Hill at the northern end of Missionary Ridge. Beginning around 10:30 am, Smith's brigade and nearby units became the target of piecemeal Federal attacks. During an early counterattack, Smith was badly wounded and Granbury took command of the brigade. So many gunners from Swett's Mississippi Battery became casualties, that soldiers from the 7th Texas were detailed to man the guns. At 4:00 pm Cleburne ordered a counterattack which was highly successful. Led by Granbury's Texans, the Confederates charged, capturing numerous Union soldiers and sweeping the survivors off Tunnel Hill. Granbury's Texas brigade fought at the Battle of Ringgold Gap on 27 November 1863. Cleburne's division took a strong position at the gap in order to slow Federal pursuit of the Confederate army. Cleburne posted Granbury's brigade on the right flank on a ridge. The Texans routed the first three Union regiments from Charles R. Woods's brigade that tried to attack. When another regiment threatened to outflank the 7th Texas on the brigade's right flank, Cleburne sent in the 1st Arkansas Infantry Regiment which drove back the Federal troops. After four hours of combat, Cleburne withdrew his division in good order and there was no pursuit. Granbury was soon promoted to brigadier general in command of the brigade. Throughout the Atlanta Campaign in summer of 1864, Granbury's men were engaged in the Battle of Rocky Face Ridge, the Battle of Resaca, the Battle of Pickett's Mill, the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain, the Battle of Peachtree Creek, the Battle of Atlanta, and the Battle of Jonesborough. At different times during the campaign, the 7th Texas was commanded by Captains J. H. Collet, C. E. Talley, and J. W. Brown. The 7th Texas lost 17 killed, 76 wounded, and seven missing in the campaign. At the Battle of Jonesborough on 1 September 1864, a Federal corps overran Daniel Govan's Arkansas brigade, capturing its commander and half of its soldiers. However, Granbury's brigade was next in line and it stopped the Union attack. At the Battle of Franklin on 30 November 1864, the 7th Texas lost 18 killed, 25 wounded, and 22 captured. Generals Cleburne and Granbury were both killed and the commanding officer of the 7th Texas, Captain Brown was captured. In the Battle of Nashville on 15‚Äì16 December, Granbury's former brigade, which now included the 35th Tennessee Infantry Regiment, was so reduced in officers and men that it was commanded by a captain and the 7th Texas was led by Captain O. P. Forrest. After the battle, at least 23 soldiers from the 7th Texas fell into Federal hands, many of whom lay wounded in hospitals. About one-fourth of the regiment was furloughed at this time. The remnant of the 7th Texas served in the Campaign of the Carolinas in early 1865. The regiment was assigned to Govan's brigade in John C. Brown's division of William J. Hardee's corps. The 7th Texas was consolidated with the other Texas units from Granbury's old brigade and the unit was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel W. A. Ryan. The Texans were present at the Battle of Averasborough on 16 March 1865 and the Battle of Bentonville on 19‚Äì21 March. When Joseph E. Johnston surrendered to Sherman on 26 April 1865, the 7th Texas counted two surgeons, six officers and 57 men. The last known survivor of the 7th Texas was Charles W. Trice of Company A who died on 1 December 1936 at Lexington, North Carolina. Trice was wounded at the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain on 27 June 1864 and had an arm amputated.

Background From July 27, 1919, to August 3, 1919, there was a Chicago Race Riot that was covered extensively in national media. This increased tension in both the Black and White communities. Also, in July 1919 there were a number of racial incidents in Alabama including a race riot in Tuscaloosa, Alabama and in Hobson City, Alabama the black mayor, Newman O'Neal, faced death threats and was assaulted forcing him to flee. Race riot On August 1, 1919, a fight broke out between a White man and a group of Black youths. The violence quickly spiralled out of control and a gun battle broke out between White and Black communities where two white men and one Black man were shot but not seriously wounded. A few of those wounded were Fred Bates and Charles Chapman who received a bullet in the hip. The Chattanooga News reported that at one point a white mob had surrounded a group of Blacks in the woods. Media reports later said that local Sheriff C. E. Cox, of Clarke County was able to suppress the riot with his police presence. Alabama Senate At the time the Alabama legislature was worried about racial strife and passed a resolution. This resolution says: The resolution went to the senate at once and was adopted by that body. Aftermath This uprising was one of several incidents of civil unrest that began in the so-called American Red Summer of 1919. Terrorist attacks on black communities and white oppression in over three dozen cities and counties. In most cases, white mobs attacked African American neighborhoods. In some cases, black community groups resisted the attacks, especially during the Chicago Race Riot and Washington D.C. race riot which killed 38 and 39 people respectively. Most deaths occurred in rural areas during events like the Elaine Race Riot in Arkansas, where an estimated 100 to 240 black people and 5 white people were killed.

The riot occurred in Toledo, Ohio, beginning on July 23, 1967. Tensions were high across the midwest that week as the 1967 Detroit riots in nearby Detroit had been escalating since Sunday July 23. The first glass was broken in Toledo on Monday, the day after the unrest began in Detroit. It was mostly the work of roving gangs of kids, likely inspired by the images they were seeing on TV coming from the Motor City. They began their copycat crime spree by walking the streets of several neighborhoods, breaking windows, looting stores and setting fires. A dozen fires were set the first night, many of them in the Dorr Street corridor between Detroit Avenue and City Park. The first glass was broken in Toledo on Monday, the day after the unrest began in Detroit. It was mostly the work of roving gangs of kids, likely inspired by the images they were seeing on TV coming from the Motor City. They began their copycat crime spree by walking the streets of several neighborhoods, breaking windows, looting stores and setting fires. A dozen fires were set the first night, many of them in the Dorr Street corridor between Detroit Avenue and City Park. There was also looting of stores in the downtown area at Monroe and 17th Streets and windows were smashed in the Miracle Mile Shopping Center in west Toledo. As the night progressed, violence flared in numerous sections of the city. At Monroe and 10th Street, nine people were arrested with gasoline, bottles and rag wicks, the crude ingredients for firebombs. A fire bomb was believed to have caused a $10,000 fire at the Kellermyers Chemical Co on Brown Ave in east Toledo. As the reports of fires and looting continued in the early hours of the morning, more Toledo police officers were called in to help quell the situation and even in the Toledo suburbs, of Oregon, Maumee and Sylvania, extra crews were summoned just in case their normally tranquil streets would become targets for the restless youth. In another preemptive move, Toledo Police and County Deputies camped out on the Michigan State border to stop any potential Detroit \\"rioters\\" from coming across the state line. Also on alert, and ready for deployment was the Ohio National Guard and they got their chance the next day when 500 guardsmen were mobilized and put on standby at the Secor Road Armory in the event that Toledo Police needed their assistance. A 9pm curfew was placed on everyone under the age of 21 in the city by Mayor John Potter. Many stores and bars and taverns were also asked to close, while some Community Traction bus routes were shut down through some neighborhoods. After several motorists were attacked and seriously injured by rock and bottle throwing teens, police opted to block off some streets in area of known trouble spots. Tuesday and Wednesday brought more reports of looting and dozens of scattered disturbances around the city including the arrests of more than a dozen people caught with fire bomb materials and weapons. When the city finally calmed down after five tense and turbulent days, police had made more than 180 arrests, and fire crews had responded to almost 80 arson fires.

Among its students were painters Mabel Alvarez, Herman Cherry, Stanton MacDonald-Wright and Rex Slinkard; illustrators Conrad Buff, Pruett Carter and Paul Sample; architects Harwell Hamilton Harris and Chalfant Head; and artists who worked on Hollywood films, such as Carl Anderson, John Huston and Dorothy Jeakins.Julia Armstrong-Totten, \\"The Legacy of the Art Student League,\\" in Julia Armstrong-Totten, et al., A Seed of Modernism: The Art Students League of Los Angeles, 1906-1953, exhibition catalogue, Pasadena Museum of California Art. 2008. The League had a pattern of hiring its own--many of its instructors and most of its directors were alumni. It suspended classes during World War II, and had a short-lived revival after the war. History The League grew out of the life classes taught by landscape painter Hanson Puthuff in his L.A. studio.Will South, \\"The Art Student League of Los Angeles: A Brief History,\\" in Julia Armstrong-Totten, et al., A Seed of Modernism: The Art Students League of Los Angeles, 1906-1953, exhibition catalogue, Pasadena Museum of California Art. 2008. Puthuff and Los Angeles Times art critic Antony Anderson co-founded the League on April 18, 1906. The school offered three-day-a-week morning classes for women (taught by Anderson) and three-day-a-week evening classes for men (taught by Puthuff). By December, the League had outgrown Puthuff's studio, and rented space in the Blanchard Music Hall and Art Gallery, at 10th & Figueroa Streets. > \\"One of the most interesting of the art schools in Los Angeles is the Art > Students League. Only a little over a year old, it is still in its > beginnings. Yet its growth has been steady, and there can be no doubt, it > seems to me, that it will someday be a great power for artistic good in our > community.\\" -- Antony Anderson, The Los Angeles TimesAntony Anderson, \\"Art > and Artists,\\" The Los Angeles Times, September 8, 1907. Walter Hedges bought out Puthuff's share in the League in 1907, and became the school's second director.Phil Kovinick, \\"The Art Student League of Los Angeles Chronology,\\" in Julia Armstrong-Totten, et al., A Seed of Modernism: The Art Students League of Los Angeles, 1906-1953, exhibition catalogue, Pasadena Museum of California Art. 2008. Hedges had been a student of painter Robert Henri, and embraced Henri's philosophy that an artist should paint scenes of contemporary life, capturing its energy through the use of bold color and vigorous brushwork. This was in contrast to the more conservative aesthetic of Puthuff and the California Impressionists. Puthuff and Anderson also had been among the eleven founding members of The Painters' Club of Los Angeles, a group of men artists that met every two weeks in each other's studios.Antony Anderson, \\"Art and Artists,\\" The Los Angeles Times, March 25, 1906, pp. 2, 5-6. In a diplomatic gesture, Hedges invited the Painters' Club to hold its meetings and exhibitions at the League. The Painters' Club reorganized as the California Art Club in 1909,Antony Anderson, \\"Art and Artists,\\" The Los Angeles Times, January 29, 1911. and (grudgingly) evolved into admitting women. One of the attractions of the League under Hedges was the regular availability of a nude model for the sketching and painting classes. Hedges hired champion bodybuilder and Los Angeles Athletic Club trainer Al Treloar as one of the models. =Slinkard= Rex Slinkard was an alumnus of the League, and had been the beneficiary of a 1908 League scholarship that enabled him to study under Robert Henri in New York City. Following Hedges's untimely death in January 1910, 23-year-old Slinkard was recruited to be the chief instructor at the League, and soon became the school's director. Carl Sprinchorn, another student of Henri, was hired to teach alongside Slinkard. > \\"For the present, instructors of the ASL of LA are pupils of Robert Henri of > NY--and you know what that means! You know, at once, that they are strictly > up-to-date in their artistic ideas, that they are the most modern of the > moderns, and that they are smashing academic traditions with every vigorous > stroke of charcoal stick or paintbrush.\\" -- Antony Anderson, The Los Angeles > TimesAntony Anderson, \\"Art and Artists,\\" The Los Angeles Times, [date?] > 1910. Slinkard was a dynamic teacher and extremely popular with the students. He taught at the League for fewer than three years, before \\"a hasty marriage to his pregnant model\\" led to his resignation in January 1913. Sprinchorn assumed the directorship following Slinkard's abrupt departure, but himself left after less than a year.Carl Sprinchorn, Biography, at Sprinchorn.com. =MacDonald- Wright= Following a period of slow decline, the League was re-invigorated in the 1920s under the leadership of Stanton MacDonald-Wright, yet another League alumnus. He moved the school to new quarters at the Lyceum Theatre, and professionalized its curriculum. MacDonald-Wright stayed for nine years, but the school suffered an even greater decline during the Great Depression. Two of his students, James Redmond and Don Totten, attempted to turn things around, but the school was eventually reduced to little more than evening sketch classes. =World War II= Benji Okubo instructing a life class at Heart Mountain Relocation Center, 1943 Japanese-American students Benji Okubo and Hideo Date sustained the League into 1942, when they were \\"evacuated\\" to Heart Mountain Relocation Center in Wyoming.Benji Okubo, from Japanese American National Museum.Hideo Date, from Japanese American National Museum. They founded an Art Students League in the internment camp, where Okubo taught until their release in September 1945. =Post-war revival= The Art Students League of Los Angeles was revived after the war under the directorship of alumnus Fred Sexton. He reopened the school in 1949, in the same space at the Lyceum Theatre that had been its home from 1924 to 1942. It was financially unsuccessful, even after he moved classes to his private studio, and the school closed in 1953. Directors * Hanson Duvall Puthuff, 1906-1907 * Warren Hedges, 1907-1910 * Charles C.

She is the author of nonfiction books The Personality Brokers: The Strange History of Myers-Briggs and the Birth of Personality Testing (2018) and Paraliterary: The Making of Bad Readers in Postwar America (2017) and has published essays and articles in The Atlantic, Harper's Magazine, The New York Times Magazine, and other publications. Emre is an associate professor of American literature at Oxford University.  Early life  Emre was born in Adana, Turkey. She graduated in 2003 from Paul D. Schreiber Senior High School in Port Washington, NY.  Career  After graduating from Harvard in 2007, Emre worked for six months as a marketing consultant at Bain & Company. Emre says that she was a \\"terrible consultant\\" and spent most of her time at Bain studying for the literature GRE under her desk. It was at Bain that Emre first took the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, which would later be the subject of her second work of nonfiction, The Personality Brokers. Emre earned her PhD in English literature from Yale University and thereafter joined the English department faculty at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. In 2018, she was appointed an Associate Professor of American Literature at Oxford University.  Works  Emre has written extensively about the pseudonymous writer Elena Ferrante, including a lengthy essay on Ferrante's collaboration with HBO on the television series, My Brilliant Friend, based on Ferrante's Neapolitan novels. Ferrante, a famously private author who uses an alias, agreed to field questions for Emre's essay on the HBO series, resulting in a two-month correspondence between the two. She has argued against the position taken by other writers and critics, including Alexander Chee, that Ferrante's identity is irrelevant to her work; Emre contends that it is \\"precisely [Ferrante's] refusal of the biographical, and her subsequent representation of that refusal, that has lodged the biographical ever deeper into the heart of what she writes.\\" Emre's literary criticism focuses principally on \\"form and style,\\" which she contends is missing from much of today's criticism. \\"I continue to be surprised by how few critics actually engage with the text itself, how so much of the criticism is just a projection of people‚Äôs feelings and a little bit of hand waving at plot and theme,\\" Emre has said. In 2017, Emre published Paraliterary: The Making of Bad Readers in Postwar America (The University of Chicago Press). The Los Angeles Review of Books said that Paraliterary is about \\"bad readers,\\" and \\"is appropriately conscious that throughout the 20th century, a disproportionate number of readers labeled bad were female.\\" Emre published The Personality Brokers (Penguin Random House) a year later; it is a historical and biographical account of Katherine Briggs and Isabel Briggs Myers' invention of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). She is finishing a book titled Post-Discipline, and is reportedly working on a book to be titled The Female Cool, about \\"cold, cruel, unsentimental, unempathetic women writers and artists.\\"  Reception  The Personality Brokers generally received favorable reviews. The New York Times called the work \\"inventive and beguiling.\\" The Wall Street Journal called it a \\"riveting\\" book to which Emre brought \\"the skills of a detective, cultural critic, historian, scientist and biographer.\\" The Personality Brokers was listed in the New York Times Critics' Top Books of 2018 and named one of The Economist's \\"books of the year\\" for 2018. However, Louis Menand, writing for The New Yorker, criticized Emre for using the \\"wrong context\\" to analyze the MBTI's historical antecedents and took issue with her credentials for critiquing the MBTI, arguing that \\"professors are the last people who should object to society‚Äôs people-sorting operations.\\" Louis Menand, himself a professor, in turn faced criticism for his review, including the charge that Menand betrayed a \\"fundamental misunderstanding\\" of how the MBTI was intended to be used.

It was constituted of the old battleship Lorraine, of the three modern heavy cruisers Duquesne, Tourville and Suffren, of the light cruiser Duguay-Trouin, three destroyers , , Fortun√©, and the submarine Prot√©e.  Career  Under Admiral Godfroy, the squadron departed Toulon on April 1940, arriving at Alexandria on 24 May, where she met with her British counterpart under Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham. On 4 July 1940, a secret order from British Prime Minister Churchill, Operation Catapult, tasked the Royal Navy to destroy, neutralise or capture French naval forces. Godfroy and Cunningham having a trusting relationship, and their families being related by alliance, they engaged in negotiations and managed a compromise, whereby French ships would remove fuel from their bunkers and firing mechanisms from their weapons, and the remaining crews would not attempt to escape; in return, Cunningham promised to repatriate most of the crews, accepted that the ships retain their French commanding officers, and would not be scuttled. The heavy cruiser Duquesne would be allowed to radio official messages, and private messages once a week. On the occasion, several officers deserted to join the Free French, such as Commander Auboyneau, or Lieutenant-Commander d'Estienne d'Orves and his companions Roger Barberot and Andr√© Patou. The ships were then interned at Alexandria with skeleton crews. Godfroy and Cunningham signed the convention on 7 July, and renewed it on 20 June 1942. On 30 May 1943, following the invasion of the so-called Free Zone by the Nazis, the whole of Force X joined the Allies. Admiral Godfroy was thus granted authorisation from the British to put to sea, and put his forces at the disposal of the provisional government in Algiers, as the French Committee of National Liberation was put in place. The squadron rallied Dakar through the Suez Canal and Cape Town, before arriving at Algiers. Upon his arrival, Godfroy, suspected of favouring General Giraud over De Gaulle, was retired by decree in December 1943.

Background  Active labour market policies (ALMP) are used to maintain labor force participation, and social mobility over time in order to improve market efficiency . The focus of these policies can vary depending on the challenges faced in promoting or retaining labor force participation through the use of socially progressive policies. More specifically, these types of policies are employed as a measure for reducing bouts of high unemployment, but do not necessarily focus on creating more jobs within the labor market. In Denmark, the country's Social Democracy was first established during the end of the 19th century, after serious labor conflicts that led to the recognition of trade union rights. The resulting labor agreements severely limited the right to strike and disrupt production, in exchange for union involvement in the crafting of labor policy. Over the last century, labor organization have retained this influence on policy, with the state taking charge of much of the cost associated to skill development and other social aspects of the work. The Danish welfare-through-work approach that evolved is based on this compromise. 1990s During the 1990s Denmark had implemented a variety of ALMP strategies that focused on the restructuring of its welfare state through a 'welfare-through-work' model. This model formulated the ALMP strategies based on three critical principles: # the basis of need, # decentralization, and # actively involved social partners. By 1994, Denmark had begun to implement the focus its labor policy reforms on ALMP policies geared towards promoting access to educational leave and employment training offers that were later translated into the Active Social Policy Act of 1998. Between 1998 and 2002, Denmark spent on average 1.7% of its total GDP on ALMPs and was one of the biggest spenders among Nordic social market economies. Post-1994 policies were delegated to local governments and were primarily geared toward reducing the period during which unemployed workers could receive benefits, which in turn, emphasized the salience of educational leave programs that provided forms of vocational training and supervised work- based experience. Most ALMPs that were being promoted during this decade were aimed at maintaining unemployment levels at a steady rate and effectively mobilizing the unemployed, a practice named activation. 21st Century Following the turn of the century, the 2007-08 Great Recession promoted a healthy economic growth and resilient demand of labor which, in turn, resulted in a low ratio of available jobs and a high level of unemployed job seekers. The changing economic situation constituted a challenge to the effectiveness of pre-established ALMPs in Denmark and other OECD countries. Initial increases in the investment into ALMPs proved necessary in order to adjust for the economic downturn. In a 2015 report on public expenditures on activation policies, Denmark was listed as the top country investing in ALMP programs, spending 2.05% of GDP that year.

In 1982, she became the first woman to be elected a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering.  Early life  Killick was born in London to George Killick and Winifred Baines. Her father was a chartered accountant who was made an Order of the British Empire in 1954 for service to the Cotton Board. Her maternal grandfather was a political agent, and her mother's brothers worked for the London Stock Exchange. Killick attended Streatham and Clapham High School. She moved to Cheshire during World War II to avoid the Blitz.  Career  Killick joined the Women's Auxiliary Air Force and worked as a radar mechanic. When she was demobilized in 1947, Killick was briefly at the Royal Air Force Institute of Aviation Medicine as a laboratory assistant, before going to the University of St Andrews where she earned a degree in natural philosophy in 1951 and was awarded an honorary doctorate in 1998. In 1951 Killick joined the Admiralty Signals and Radar Establishment, working in a group which later became the Antenna Division. By 1966 she had risen to the civil service grade of Senior Principal Scientific Officer, although the ASRE had by then been absorbed into the Admiralty Surface Weapons Establishment (ASWE). Her work was of course highly secret but in 1967 she made one of only a few public presentations of her work, a paper on Radar Techniques at a meeting of the Portsmouth and District Physical Society on 8th March 1967. She joined the Admiralty Underwater Weapons Establishment (AUWE) in 1969, in which year she was also allowed to present some more of her work at the 1st European Microwave Conference. At the AUWE she worked on the radar systems used in Royal Navy warships, as well as the torpedoes used in submarines and aircraft. She concentrated on defence and radar systems before moving to torpedoes development. The provision of radar to the Royal Navy was the remit of ASWE. The AUWE's work was in investigating future techniques and technologies, such as homing and guidance systems for the torpedoes, which were eventually incorporated into submarines' Spearfish and Sting Ray torpedoes. In 1976 she was promoted to Deputy Chief Scientific Officer and Head of the Underwater Weapons Department at AUWE. During her time at the AUWE, the main building became known as Betty's Hilton because of Killick's presence. She did not like being considered a \\"woman engineer\\"; and would not permit the Women's Engineering Society to interview her. Whilst she preferred being known for her excellence, not her gender, she worked to promote equality during her time at the AUWE. This included removing a rule claiming women must wear skirts. In 1980, Killick was elected Fellow of the Institution of Electrical Engineers, and was the first woman to be elected to the Royal Academy of Engineering in 1982. She served as a board member for the Marine Technology Directorate, where she coordinated projects between the government, academia and industry. After leaving the AUWE, Killick joined the General Electric Company, who were building the torpedoes developed by Killick. She did not get on well with Arnold Weinstock and left the organisation. In 1988 St Andrews University awarded her an honorary doctorate.  Personal life  Killick lived in Stoughton, West Sussex. Recreational interests included sailing, skiing and local history. She died of a heart attack on 7 July 2019.  Publications  A temperature independent frequency scanning antenna. Croney J., Killick E.A., Foster D. 1st European Microwave Conference.

Early life David Caldwell was born in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania Colony on March 25, 1725. He was the oldest of four sons of Andrew and Martha Caldwell. His father was a farmer. Caldwell served as a carpenter until age twenty five when he entered the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) and was graduated in 1761. After graduation, he studied theology and was licensed as a clergyman in 1763 by the Presbytery of New Brunswick. Caldwell was ordained in 1765 and took an assignment as a missionary in the North Carolina back country. He became pastor of the Buffalo and Alamance Presbyterian churches, established by the Nottingham Colony, in Rowan County, North Carolina (the section that became Guilford County in 1771). Caldwell married Rachel Craighead in 1766. Teaching, military and political career Site of the Caldwell Log College, now Tanger Bicentennial Gardens In 1767, he established what became known as the Dr. Caldwell's Log College in what would become Guilford County. This college was a theological and classical school for young men. A lack of physicians in the area of North Carolina where he lived, prompted him to study medicine from books that he acquired from Philadelphia. He became a self-taught practicing physician, which was useful also during the military conflicts of the times. David Caldwell was present at the Battle of Alamance during the War of the Regulation on May 16, 1771. He represented Guilford County at the North Carolina Provincial Congress at Halifax in 1776 that wrote and adopted the North Carolina Constitution. He was also a delegate to the Hillsborough Convention in 1788 that considered the U.S. Constitution but failed to ratify it. Rev. Caldwell urged his congregations to volunteer during the American Revolution and War of 1812.

He was first a major. In 1781, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel under Colonel Francis Locke. On May 1, 1782, he was assigned as a lieutenant colonel in the newly re-created 2nd Rowan County Regiment, where he served until the end of the war. He was at the Battle of Cowpens in South Carolina, where he was wounded; and also fought at the Battle of Haw River.

The mountain's name is derived from the depression between the two peaks of nearly identical elevation. The Cradle is situated within the Alpine Lakes Wilderness and is part of the Wenatchee Mountains, which is subset of the Cascade Range. Its nearest higher peak is Jack Ridge, to the east-southeast. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of Icicle Creek, which in turn is a tributary of the Wenatchee River. The first ascent of the south peak was made in 1944 by Gene Paxton and Dwight Watson, whereas the north peak wasn't climbed until 1952 by Bill and Gene Prater. Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the Cascades experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Geology The Alpine Lakes Wilderness features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite walls spotted with over 700 mountain lakes. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The last glacial retreat in the Alpine Lakes area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada‚ÄìUS border by 10,000 years ago. The U-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area.

The battle took place against a background of a long-running enmity between the Cuncos and Spanish dating back to the destruction of Osorno in 1603. More immediate causes were the killing of Spanish shipwreck survivors and looting of the cargo by Cuncos which led to Spanish desire's for a punishment combined with lucrative slave raiding. While Cuncos and Jesuits made attempts to placate the mood of war, maestre de campo Juan de Salazar eventually convinced Governor of Chile Antonio de Acu√±a Cabrera to authorise and support his expedition. The battle was fought across Bueno River where Cuncos and Huilliches repelled Spanish attempts to cross the river, ending up with hundreds of Spanish troops drowned or killed. The battle contributed to the eventual Mapuche uprising of 1655, in which many Spanish settlements and haciendas were ravaged. The Battle of R√≠o Bueno along with the subsequent events led to a political crisis among the Spanish in Chile with a risk of civil war. The severity of the crisis made Miguel Luis Amun√°tegui list it among the precursors to the Independence of Chile. The Cuncos and Huilliches south of Bueno River these tribes remained de facto independent until the late 18th century. Background =Renewed Cunco-Spanish conflict= Governor of Chile Antonio de Acu√±a Cabrera arranged the Parliament of Boroa in January 1651.Barros Arana 2000, p. 339. With this parliament, peace was established between the Spanish and the northern Mapuches.Pinochet et al., 1997, p. 83. On March 21, 1651, a ship sailing to the newly re- established Spanish city of Valdivia was pushed by storms onto coasts inhabited by the Cuncos, a southern Mapuche tribe.Barros Arana 2000, p. 340. There, the ship ran aground and while most of the crew managed to survive the wreck, nearby Cuncos killed them and took possession of the valuable cargo.Barros Arana 2000, p. 341. The Spanish made fruitless efforts to recover anything left in the wreck.Barros Arana 2000, p. 342. Governor Acu√±a Cabrera was temporarily dissuaded to send a punitive expedition from Boroa by Jesuits fathers Diego de Rosales and Juan de Moscoso who argued that the murders were committed by a few Indians and warned the governor that renewing warfare would evaporate gains obtained at Boroa. Punitive expeditions were finally sent against the Cunco, one from Valdivia and one from Carelmapu.Barros Arana 2000, p. 343. Governor of Valdivia Diego Gonz√°lez Montero advanced south with his forces but soon found that tribes he expected to join him as allies were indifferent and even misled him with false rumors. His troops ran out of supplies and had to return to Valdivia. While Gonz√°lez Montero was away coastal Huilliches killed twelve Spanish and sending their heads to other Mapuche groups of southern Chile \\"as if they wanted to create a grand uprising\\" according to historian Diego Barros Arana. Both Spanish expeditions were meant to meet each other at Bueno River but the failure of the expedition from Valdivia prevented this. The expedition from Carelmapu led by Captain Ignacio Carrera Yturgoyen penetrated north to the vicinity of the ruins of Osorno where they were approached by Huilliches who handed over three \\"caciques\\", allegedly responsible for the murders. The Spanish and local Huilliches exchanged words telling each other of the benefits of peace. Then, the Spanish of Carelmapu executed the three, hanged them in hooks as a warning, and returned south. Spanish soldiers in Concepci√≥n, the \\"military capital\\" of Chile, were dissatisfied with the results. Barros Arana consider some may have pushed for war for personal benefit. =Salazar's slave-hunting army= Acu√±a Cabrera and his brother in law maestre de campo Juan de Salazar began to plan an expedition to the lands of the Cuncos in the spring of 1653.Barros Arana 2000, p. 346. It was thought to be a lucrative slave raiding expedition. Despite a general ban on the slavery of indigenous people by the Spanish Crown, the 1598‚Äì1604 Mapuche uprising that ended with the Destruction of the Seven Cities made the King of Spain in 1608 declare slavery legal for those Mapuches caught in war.Valenzuela M√°rquez 2009, p. 231‚Äì233 Mapuches \\"rebels\\" were considered Christian apostates and could therefore be enslaved according to the church teachings of the day. In reality these legal changes only formalized Mapuche slavery that was already occurring at the time, with captured Mapuches being treated as property in the way that they were bought and sold among the Spanish. Legalisation made Spanish slave raiding increasingly common in the Arauco War. Mapuche slaves were exported north to places such as La Serena and Lima.Valenzuela M√°rquez 2009, pp. 234‚Äì236 To reinforce the expeditionary army, Acu√±a Cabrera attempted first to revive a practice of military service for local encomenderos, however, the encomenderos refused to obey the order. Acu√±a Cabrera ignored this insubordination and proceeded instead to boost the expedition with the purchase of 400 horses in Santiago. Battle The Spanish expedition started from the fort of Nacimento in La Frontera with a force of 900 soldiers and 1500 Indian auxiliaries.Pinochet et al., 1997, p. 79. Bueno River as seen from Chile Route 5. The Spanish reached the northern shores of east-to-west flowing Bueno River on January 11, 1654. To cross the river, Salazar ordered the construction of a pontoon bridge.Barros Arana 2000, p. 347. Local Mapuche-Huilliches had been warned in advance of the Spanish advance south, so they concentrated in large numbers on the opposite shore of the river. The Mapuche-Huilliche had brought women and children with them, but they remained hidden in the forest, as did also most of the men, only the ones on horseback revealing themselves to the Spanish. In total Mapuche-Huilliche forces numbered about 3000 men armed primarily with lances. Some veteran officers expressed their doubts about Salazar's plans, including the stability of the bridge. As the pontoon bridge stood ready, Juan de Salazar sent a first force across. About 200 soldiers that had crossed were quickly surrounded and were being routed, so Salazar ordered the other soldiers to speed up their march across the bridge. However, the bridge was not stable enough and at this point broke apart with disastrous consequences for the Spanish. Altogether, the Spanish lost a hundred professional soldiers and two hundred auxiliaries in a battle where the actual fighting was very limited. Despite these losses, the Spanish managed to get back north to their bases without harassment from the Mapuche. Aftermath When learning about the defeat, governor Acu√±a Cabrera ordered an investigation about military misconduct during the campaign. Rather than blaming Juan de Salazar for his recklessness, his sister Juana de Salazar, who was the wife of the governor, arranged for witnesses to justify her brother's conduct. Furthermore, the investigation results called for Juan de Salar to be granted the command of an even larger army to chastise the Cuncos and allow Salazar to \\"recover his honour\\". The planning of a second expedition in the summer of 1655 contributed to unleashing a large Mapuche uprising that year.Barros Arana 2000, p. 348.Barros Arana 2000, p. 349.

It was officially considered an Armenian National division, and initially almost all its personnel were of that nationality. After forming it remained in service along the border with Turkey until nearly the end of 1942, when it was redeployed to the 44th Army in Transcaucasus Front, assisting in driving the German 17th Army into the Kuban peninsula. Following this the division was moved to the 46th Army in Southwestern Front and took part in the summer offensive through the Donbass and eastern Ukraine. In October it was moved again, now to the 57th Army in 2nd Ukrainian Front; it would remain in that Front for the duration of the war, moving to the 7th Guards Army in December. After crossing the Dniepr the 409th won a battle honor in January, 1944, then spent the spring and summer in the battles around Jassy and Kishenev in Moldova. After the defeat of Romania the division advanced into Hungary as part of the 27th Guards Rifle Corps. In October it rejoined the 7th Guards Army, where it remained for the duration, mostly in the 25th Guards Rifle Corps. After the fall of Budapest the division joined the final advances on Vienna and Prague in the spring of 1945, and was disbanded shortly thereafter.

Glantz, Colossus Reborn, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2005, pp. 594-95 For well over the entire first year of its service, the 409th was in 45th Army along the border with Turkey. On February 3, 1942, Kombrig Mikhail Ivanovich Zaporozhchenko took command of the division from Colonel Vasilyan, but the latter returned to command on July 15. Shortly before the 409th moved to the fighting front, Vasilyan handed the unit over to Col. Vasilii Fedorovich Gladkov. Kuban, Donbass and Ukraine In December the division was moved to 44th Army in Lt. Gen. Ivan Maslennikov's Northern Group of Forces in Transcaucasus Front.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 19 By the beginning of January, 1943, with the destruction of German 6th Army at Stalingrad imminent, Army Group A was forced to fall back from the positions it had taken in the Caucasus region during the previous summer and fall. The Northern Group was in the Grozny and Taman sector and set out in pursuit when 1st Panzer Army began its retreat on January 1. The German command planned to fall back only as far as the Kuma River, but this could not be held and Maslennikov's forward detachments were over it in force on January 10. Meanwhile the Soviet Southern Front was advancing towards the Manych River, threatening Army Group A's supply line through Rostov. In the event the 4th Panzer Army was able to hold this line long enough for 1st Panzer Army to escape, while 17th Army fell back to the Kuban bridgehead.Robert Forczyk, The Kuban 1943, The Wehrmacht's Last Stand in the Caucasus, Osprey Publishing, Oxford, UK, 2018, Kindle ed. On January 18 Colonel Gladkov had handed command of the 409th to Col. Mikhail Ignatevich Dobrovolskii. By the beginning of February the division had been moved to the 37th Army in what was now called the North Caucasus Front,Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 42 where it engaged in mostly fruitless fighting against the heavily fortified bridgehead. In March it was removed to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command and sent north. When the summer campaign began in July the division was part of the 46th Army in Southwestern Front.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", pp. 112-13 As of the beginning of August the 409th was back in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command with 46th Army, returning that month to Southwestern Front, then to Steppe Front in September.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, pp. 206, 225, 252 Steppe Front would be renamed 2nd Ukrainian Front on October 20, and the division would remain in this front for the duration of the war. During October is was reassigned to the 64th Rifle Corps in 57th Army. By the end of 1943, after five months of almost continuous offensive combat, the division had a total strength of 2,947 officers and men, armed with 1,424 rifles, 483 sub-machine guns, 11 heavy machine guns, 36 light machine guns, 30 antitank rifles, 23 mortars and 21 artillery pieces of all calibres.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 113 =Kirovograd Offensive= In December the 409th was moved to the 25th Guards Rifle Corps of 7th Guards Army. It would be part of that Army for most of the rest of the war, apart from those periods when it was serving as a separate rifle division directly under Front control. On December 5 Colonel Dobrovolskii was succeeded in command by Col. Gavriil Stepanovich Sorokin. On January 3, 1944 the 2nd Ukrainian Front began a new offensive against German 8th Army in the great bend west of the Dniepr River, aimed at Kirovograd.Earl F. Ziemke, Stalingrad to Berlin, Center of Military History United States Army, Washington, DC, 1968, p. 223 On January 8 the city was liberated, and the division was awarded a battle honor:On February 7, in a final change of command, Colonel Sorokin was replaced by Maj. Gen. Evstafii Petrovich Grechanyi. During the westward advance from Kirovograd the division was recognized for its part in the liberation of Novoukrainka with the award of the Order of Bogdan Khmelnitsky, 2nd Degree, on March 29. Jassy-Kishinev Offensives As of the start of April the 409th was serving as a separate rifle division in the reserves of the Front. A month later it had been joined with the 297th Rifle Division in the 27th Guards Rifle Corps, still in the reserve.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, pp. 108, 138 Due to its reserve status the division saw little, if any, combat in the early stages of the first Jassy-Kishinev offensive, but in the last days of May the German 8th Army began a counteroffensive against the 52nd Army north of Ia»ôi which they codenamed Operation \\"Sonja\\". This made significant gains over two days and the Front commander, Marshal Ivan Konev, ordered the 27th Guards Corps to reinforce the adjacent 27th Army. This proved timely as the 8th Army launched its Operation \\"Katja\\" with four panzer and three infantry divisions against that Army's positions northwest of Ia»ôi on June 2. This powerful force was facing three weak rifle divisions and about 50 tanks of 2nd Tank Army. The arrival of 27th Guards and 35th Rifle Corps would tip the balance of forces in Soviet favor, but this would take from two to five days.Glantz, Red Storm Over the Balkans, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2007, pp. 339, 347, 351 Overnight on June 4/5 the 409th arrived at the front, taking up positions between the remnants of the 202nd Rifle Division at Epureni and the 337th Rifle Division at Tipilesti, facing elements of the Gro√üdeutschland Panzergrenadier Division and the Romanian 18th Mountain Division. In the morning the panzergrenadiers reached the southern approaches to Tipilesti but faltered in the face of the 409th's resistance, backed by the remainder of the 3rd Tank Corps. After further fighting on the following day the German offensive went into a lull which was followed by a Soviet counterattack on June 7 south of Epureni involving the division which drove part of Gro√üdeutschland back and convinced the German command to go over to the defensive. The fighting front remained quiet until late August.Glantz, Red Storm Over the Balkans, pp. 361-65 =Second Jassy-Kishinev Offensive= At the beginning of August the 409th was still in 27th Guards Corps, with the 297th and 214th Rifle Divisions,Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 229 and was in the second echelon behind the 7th Guards and 27th Armies between the Seret and Prut Rivers. According to the plan of the offensive the Corps was to be prepared to operate in the zone of either of these Armies. For the artillery preparation when the offensive began on August 20 all the Corps' artillery, including that of the 409th and the other divisions, was used in support of 27th Army, specifically the 206th Rifle and 4th Guards Airborne Divisions in the first echelon. In the event the offensive unfolded so successfully that 27th Guards Corps remained in Front reserve until the end of the operation and through August 25‚Äì27 was employed in clearing the central part of the Mare ridge of roaming groups of defeated German and Romanian troops. In the last days of the month there was one remaining major group of German forces in the rear of 2nd Ukrainian Front, and the Corps was brought in to secure the road from Roman to BacƒÉu to Adzud Nou.

History  The fortress was built by the wife of King Heraclius II, Darejan of the Dadiani family in 1788-1798. It was the last of its kind in feudal Georgia. Kolagiri fortress served as an outpost for Tbilisi and was a hiding place for the surrounding population during the raids. At the beginning of the 19th century, the fortress lost its defensive value and was used for some time as a prison. At present, a monastery inhabits the fortress.  Description  Queen Darejna This complex was one of the last carried out by the Kolagiri resident family of these types built in Kartli-Kakheti. It is built in 1788-1798 by Queen Darejan.

Adams (February 26, 1865 ‚Äì September 8, 1949) was a musician, teacher, and author who, with the assistance of Adelle Prentiss Hughes, founded the Cleveland Music School Settlement.  Biography  Adams was born on February 26, 1865 in Meadville, Pennsylvania to James Adams, an itinerant preacher, and Katherine Adams (n√©e Ketchum). As an infant, Almeda lost her eyesight and was blind the rest of her life. Her family lived in many places in Ohio, and Almeda attended the State School for the Blind in Columbus, Ohio. She sold 2000 subscriptions to the Ladies Home Journal to earn a scholarship to the New England Conservatory of Music. After graduation, she taught for a period in Nebraska at Lincoln Normal University and Nebraska School for the Blind, eventually returned to New York city for further study, and finally settled in Cleveland, Ohio. In Cleveland, Adams pursued many musical endeavors including teaching at several settlement houses. Inspired by the creation of music settlement houses in New York City and encouraged by her father, she approached Adella Prentiss Hughes, who founded The Cleveland Orchestra, for assistance in establishing a music settlement house in Cleveland. In 1912, Adams, with the assistance of Hughes, established the Cleveland Music School Settlement with a $1000 donation from the Fortnightly Musical Club and support from other notable Cleveland families. The Cleveland Music School Settlement, which continues to operate today as The Music Settlement, grew to include music instruction, music therapy, and other services at both its main location and several outreach sites. Adams was dedicated to making music instruction available to children and adults and focused on making lessons and other services accessible to underprivileged individuals. From its inception, The Cleveland Music Settlement School provided free and low-cost instruction to better serve the community. Along with the establishment of the Cleveland Music School Settlement, Adams also directed the Schumann Society from 1918 to 1931, which was a choral group for working girls. Adams published Seeing Europe Through Sightless Eyes in 1929. In this book, Adams described her personal reactions to art she was able to experience in Europe either through the descriptions of the voice student she was chaperoning or through touch. She continued to teach until 1948 and died a year later on September 8, 1949 at the age of 84. Adams was interred with her family in Lakeview Cemetery.

Tanjiro is a teenager who goes on a quest to restore the humanity of his sister, Nezuko, who was turned into a demon after his family was killed by Muzan Kibutsuji following an attack that resulted the death of his other relatives. After an encounter with Giyu Tomioka, a demon slayer, Tanjiro is recruited by Giyu to also become a demon slayer to help his sister turn human again and avenge his family. Besides Ufotable's Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba anime adaptation, Tanjiro has also appeared in a light novel that acts as a prequel to the manga. Koyoharu Got≈çge created Tanjiro following a suggestion from his editor of having a bright main character who would stand out in his dark narrative. His design influenced by Himura Kenshin from Nobuhiro Watsuki's manga Rurouni Kenshin when deciding how andrognynous the character should look. In the anime series, Tanjiro is voiced by Natsuki Hanae in Japanese and Zach Aguilar in English. The character has been well received by manga and anime critics due to his caring nature and relationship with his sister while also becoming a strong fighter. This has led to the character winning multiple awards based on his popularity with Hanae's performance as him also receiving one. Creation and design Early sketches of Nezuko and Tanjiro Tanjiro Kamado originates from Koyoharu Got≈çge's ideas involving a one-shot with Japanese motifs. Tatsuhiko Katayama, his editor, was worried about the one-shot being too dark for the young demographic and asked Got≈çge if he could write another type of main character who would be \\"brighter\\". Got≈çge has cited issues in the making of the character due to the contrast he has with the dark narrative. For the release of the manga's seventh chapter, Got≈çge drew a cover of Tanjiro wielding his sword while smiling. However, due to the constrating aesthetics the manga had. As a result, Got≈çge discarded the drawing and instead drew a similar design with Tanjiro having a serious expression. In the initial design, Tanjiro did not have a scar or wear earrings, but in the end they felt these features really accentuated the character. In the making of the cast, Tanjiro had four supporting characters who would balance each other due to their different skills. The editor commented about Tanjiro, \\"[He] is a type of male main character that you don't really see much. He's so kind. He has Nezuko, so he's coming from this position where he can't just say all demons are absolute evil. He's in the gray zone.\\" Tanjiro's design was also influenced by Got≈çge's editor: he suggested giving Tanjiro a facial scar in his forehead inspired by Himura Kenshin from Nobuhiro Watsuki's manga Rurouni Kenshin while also giving him earrings in order to balance how androgynous he would look. Yuma Takahashi, the producer behind the adaptation of the manga said he enjoyed Tanjiro's role in the manga, making him engaged in reading the series. For how Tanjiro's Water Breathing was portrayed, Ufotable received inspiration from Katsushika Hokusai's ukiyo-e style. The first fight scene between Tanjiro and Giyu was also carefully animated to give viewers an appealing choreography. Tanjiro's water-based techniques were created using a mix between hand-drawn animation and CGI, while his battle against Rui was one of the most worked scenes in the making. Takahashi also said that Tanjiro is his most relatable character from the series due to how his constant hard work inspires him. When the anime series premiered in China, Tanjiro's design was sightly altered. Due to his piercings having Rising Sun style elements, it was feared it would offend the Mainland leading to brief retouches to them. = Voice actors = Tanjiro has been voiced by Natsuki Hanae in Japanese. Hanae noted that multiple response to his career involved him portraying sad characters. However, in Tanjiro's case, he said Tanjiro is on the easy side because he says what he thinks, and is not the type that thinks one way and other things. Nezuko's actress, Akari Kit≈ç, said Hanae is like a big brother to her at the studio, supportive and if there are parts she has difficulty recording, Hanae would stay and wait till she finishes even though his part has finished. Hanae said she also thinks of Kit≈ç as a younger sister. He also says it is easier for him to do his best when he is around people who he is friendly with. Tanjiro's fighting style was liked by Hanae who reported he often made Tanjiro's shouts when playing video games. He appreciated the feedback he was given by the viewers of the anime. English voice actor Zach Aguilar was overjoyed when being given the role of voicing Tanjiro in the dub due to him being a fan of the series, as well as noting he was supported by multiple fans. In another news, Aguilar ended liking the character as well as his fellow companions, wishing to find merchandising of Tanjiro. Allegra Clark voices Tanjiro as an infant. Clark admitted she became emotional during recording of the series and liked the younger incarnation of the character. Appearances The main protagonist, Tanjiro Kamado is the oldest son of a charcoal-seller. In the first chapter of the manga, his family massacred by a demon named Muzan Kibutsuji, with only his sister Nezuko Kamado surviving. After seeing skills in battle as well as Nezuko's unwllingness to devour his brother, Giyu Tomioka sends the siblings to Sakonji Urokodaki on Mt. Sagiri in order to become a demon slayer. After a year and a half of training his body and learning swordsmanship, Tanjiro learns the sword-style. After passing a test, Tanjiro becomes a member of the Demon Slayer Corps. The siblings later meet a friendly demon named Tamayo and assists with her research to find a way to restore Nezuko's humanity. As a result, Tanjiro starts collecting samples of blood from the demons he vanquishes, the stronger the better. Later in his battle with Rui he began to use his family's technique, which itself is based on the original breath style, the , merging both to create a more sustainable fighting style. His sword's color is black, occasionally turning crimson red and becoming much stronger when combined with Nezuko's Blood Burst, a technique he later learns to perform without her help. Though he eventually avenges his family during the final battle, losing his arm and eye in the process while being fatally wounded, he recovers after Muzan turns him into a demon before his death. By losing his consciousness in the transformation to the point of attacking his own friends, Tanjiro as a demon becomes a bigger threat than Muzan himself, given that he is immune to sunlight like his sister, until he manages to return to human form, thanks to his friends's efforts, although both the eye and arm that grew back when he became a demon lost most of their functions. After the battle, Tanjiro returns home with her sister and friends. Later it is revealed that he married fellow slayer Kanao Tsuyuri. A light novel entitled Demon Slayer: Flower of Happiness chronicles the lives of Tanjiro and Zenitsu before the start of the main series. Merchandising based on Tanjiro has also been released. Reception =Critical= Critical reception to Tanjiro's character has been positive ever since his introduction. Otaku USA found Tanjiro an anti-stereotypical take from the shonen main characters due to his desire to fight being solely to find a cure to protect Nezuko, calling him as a \\"fascinating breath of fresh air\\", while highlighting his friendly personality in a dark story. Anime News Network also liked Tanjiro's design due to how it translates the narrative of his family being poor, while also liking the way the characters lives with them and later only Nezuko. Comic Book Bin felt Tanjiro's journey was inspirational due to the pain he goes to save Nezuko, making him likable. While noting that the character becomes a warrior in the second manga volume, the writer believed he might experience major pain through his quest. Nevertheless, regardless of how many battles he takes, Comic Book Bin enjoyed how Tanjiro retained his caring personality. IGN noted that despite similarities between Kimetsu no Yaiba and other series from the same genre, Tanjiro also stands out due to his caring traits, comparing him to Allen Walker from Katsura Hoshino's D.Gray-man series who also exhibits these traits when being faced with the dilemma of hurting an enemy. Tanjiro's relationship with Nezuko was acclaimed by IGN as \\"one of the most endearing parts of Demon Slayer, if not arguably its beating heart and soul\\". Fandom Post also liked Tanjiro's care for others even if the other characters he meets are antagonists, with most of them being demons. As a result, Fandom Post believed the writing in the manga made him endearing. Similarly, Manga.Tokyo questioned how would Tanjiro change in his quest due to his need of becoming stronger and whether or not he might reach the happy ending he wants. In regards to Ufotable's handling of the series, Manga.Tokyo liked his visual appearance, finding it outstanding within the shonen genre, but felt that his struggle with Giyu was harsh, making the main character more likable. Natsuki Hanae's performance as Tanjiro's Japanese voice actor was praised by the reviewer. Anime News Network shared similar feelings, but felt that his traits made him predictable. Nevertheless, the handling of Tanjiro's horror in regards to Nezuko's condition was the subject of praise. The Fandom Post enjoyed Tanjiro's debut in the series due to how Ufotable handled the character's shock upon the tragedy of his family and how he battles Giyu in order to protect his sister. As a result, he sees Tanjiro as a character with potential to be appealing. The Fandom Post enjoyed how skilled Tanjiro became in the manga's tenth volume, making it one of the best reasons to keep following the printed media. Writing for Comic Book Resources, Sage Ashford praised the protagonists, whom he called \\"the most likable male and female leads of the decade\\". Gadget Ts≈´shin listed both the breathing techniques suffix and \\"Ah! The era, the era changed again!\\" in their 2019 anime buzzwords list. Manga.Tokyo felt Tanjiro's characterization to be unique within the series the writer has seen, citing the scenes where the character cheers himself up and tries to work for his responsibilities. Tanjiro's skills in regards to his breathing was noted to be one of most surprising events in the anime series by Latin America's IGN. In late 2019, IGN wondered about the possibilities of Tanjiro dying in the manga at the hands of Muzan due to the multiple wounds he suffered in his match against the demon. By April 2020, the site once again talked about whether or not Tanjiro dies in his battle. Rather than having died, Tanjiro was commented to have suffered a worse fate; Tanjiro was confirmed to have become a demon, making his fate far darker. =Popularity= Tanjiro's character has been popular. He was ranked in 1st place as of the first Demon Slayer character popularity poll with 6,742 votes. In February 2020 at Crunchyroll Anime Awards, Tanjiro won the \\"Best Boy\\" category and the fight of Tanjiro and his sister Nezuko against Rui won the \\"Best Fight Scene\\" category. He won the Newtype \\"best male character\\" award for his role in the series, along with Natsuki Hanae also being awarded for his performance as Tanjiro. According to Comic Book Resources, Tanjiro's hanafuda earring are also highly popular within the fanbase. The same site also made a list of the 10 best quotes the character says in the anime series. He also appeared in TV Time article featuring the best characters from 2019.

A gunman shot and killed 23 people and injured 23 others. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating the shooting as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime. The shooting has been described as the deadliest attack on Latinos in modern American history. Patrick Crusius, a 21-year-old from Allen, Texas, was arrested shortly after the shooting and charged with capital murder. Police believe a manifesto with white nationalist and anti-immigrant themes, posted on the online message board 8chan shortly before the attack, was written by Crusius; it cites the year's earlier Christchurch mosque shootings and the right-wing conspiracy theory known as the Great Replacement as inspiration for the attack.  Incident  The Walmart Supercenter where the shooting took place The shooting occurred at a Walmart Supercenter near the Cielo Vista Mall on the east side of El Paso. The gunman walked into the store carrying what is believed to be a WASR-10 rifle, a semi-automatic civilian version of the AK-47, and opened fire just before 10:40 a.m. The store manager witnessed the gunman begin firing in the parking lot prior to entering the crowded store. He issued a \\"Code Brown\\", designating an active shooter, to his employees, who began helping customers evacuate or hide. Many customers and employees fled to other stores in the adjacent mall, hid under tables, or in shipping containers located behind the building. First responders began to arrive within six minutes of the initial 9-1-1 call. The El Paso Police Department, Texas Rangers and paramedics responded to the scene along with the FBI. Other first responders included off-duty police officers and members of US Customs and Border Protection. After the shooting, the suspect, Patrick Wood Crusius, drove to the intersection of Sunmount and Viscount, where he identified himself as the shooter and surrendered to Texas Rangers and an El Paso motorcycle officer.  Victims  The shooting has been described as the deadliest anti-Latino attack in recent U.S. history, resulting in 23 deaths and 23 injuries. One victim died the day after the event, another victim died two days after, and a third died eight months later on April 26, 2020. Among the dead were thirteen Americans, eight Mexicans and one German. The names, ages, and citizenships of 22 of the dead were released by the El Paso Police Department on August 5. Seventeen were 56 or older, two were in their 40s, two in their 20s, one was 36, and one was 15. \\\\- says \\"patient list\\" but the file only has the deceased--> press release from the city government Thirteen victims were taken to the University Medical Center of El Paso, and another eleven to the Del Sol Medical Center. Two children, ages 2 and 9, were transferred to El Paso Children's Hospital after their conditions were stabilized. The Del Sol Medical Center patients were between 35 and 82 years old.  Suspect  Patrick Wood Crusius (born July 27, 1998) was arrested after the shooting and charged with capital murder. A 21-year-old white male, he was last known to have lived in his family's home in Allen, Texas, in the Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth metroplex, approximately from El Paso.Tanya Eiserer, El Paso shooter was anti- social loner, former classmate says, WFAA ( August 4, 2019). He graduated in 2017 from Plano Senior High School, and was enrolled at Collin College from 2017 until spring 2019. Police said he bought the gun used in the attack legally, but provided no details about the purchase. During his first interrogation, he told detectives he had targeted Mexicans, according to an arrest warrant affidavit. =Manifesto= The El Paso police chief, Greg Allen, said that they are \\"reasonably confident\\" that a manifesto, titled The Inconvenient Truth, was posted by the suspect on the online message board 8chan shortly before the shooting. It identifies the type of weapon used in the attack; the suspect's name was revealed in a separate document in the post. Site moderators quickly removed the original post, though users continued sharing copies. Claiming to have been inspired by the Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand that killed 51 people earlier the same year, the author expresses support for the perpetrator of the Christchurch shootings and bemoans grievances such as environmental degradation, \\"cultural and ethnic replacement\\", and a \\"Hispanic invasion\\". The anti-Hispanic, anti-immigrant manifesto promotes the white nationalist and far-right conspiracy theory called the Great Replacement, often attributed to the French writer Renaud Camus. While the document uses similar language about immigrants as used by U.S. president Donald Trump, such as referring to a migrant \\"invasion\\", it states that the author's beliefs predate Trump's presidency, and that Trump should not be blamed for the attack. The author's \\"racially extremist views\\", according to The New York Times, could be used to prosecute the shooting as a hate crime or domestic terrorism. The manifesto states that Democrats would soon control the United States partly due to an increasing Hispanic population, an idea that had gained acceptance for years on right-wing radio shows. Criticizing both the Democratic Party and Republican Party for allowing corporations to \\"import foreign workers\\", the author describes the shooting as an \\"incentive\\" for Hispanics to leave the country, which would \\"remove the threat\\" of a Hispanic voting bloc. While primarily focused on ethnic and racial grievances, the document also expresses fears of automation's effects on employment and blames corporations for overusing natural resources.  Legal proceedings The arrest warrant affidavit says the suspect waived his Miranda rights, confessed to detectives that he was the shooter, and admitted that he targeted \\"Mexicans\\" during the attack. There are multiple investigations and jurisdictions involved with the case. FBI officials in El Paso served multiple warrants in the Dallas area and interviewed acquaintances of Crusius in Dallas and San Antonio. =State charges= Crusius was indicted on capital murder charges by a Texas grand jury on September 12, 2019. He pleaded not guilty to capital murder charges at his arraignment on October 10, 2019 at the El Paso County Courthouse. Mark Stevens, a San Antonio criminal defense attorney, was appointed by the state court to represent Crusius, along with defense attorney Joe Spencer. On April 28, 2020, prosecutors announced they would be seeking a new capital murder charge following the recent death of a twenty-third victim after he spent nine months in the hospital. =Federal charges= On February 6, 2020, Crusius was charged with 90 federal charges: 22 counts of committing a hate crime resulting in death, 22 counts of use of a firearm to commit murder, 23 counts of a hate crime involving an attempt to kill, and 23 counts of use of a firearm during a crime. Federal prosecutors of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Texas are seeking the death penalty, but the final decision on whether a federal capital sentence will be sought will be made by the Attorney General of the United States.Aaron Martinez, El Paso Walmart mass shooter cases inch closer to trial despite COVID-19 pandemic, El Paso Times (May 18, 2020). Crusius waived his federal bond hearing on February 12, 2020 during his first federal court appearance. A trial in federal court is expected before the trial in state court. On July 23, 2020, Crusius entered a plea of not-guilty to federal charges. He also waived his arraignment on those charges. =Defense motion= On July 14, 2020, the court accepted a motion by the defense team in which they cited mitigating factors, citing Crusius' alleged lifelong neurological and mental disabilities, which they described as \\"severe\\". The defense added that he was treated with anti-psychotic medication and that he was in a \\"psychotic state\\" when arrested.  Aftermath Memorial for the shooting victims =Funerals and vigils= Several funeral homes in El Paso and Ciudad Ju√°rez announced they would provide funeral services for free to the families of the victims as a sign of solidarity for their community. Ciudad Ju√°rez's Rotary International chapter organized a vigil in Ciudad Ju√°rez. They gathered at a park and lit candles and shone cellphone lights in El Paso's direction as a sign of solidarity. Antonio Basco declared his wife's funeral on August 16 to be open to anyone who wished to attend. Hundreds of people from El Paso and other parts of the country attended, and flowers were sent from around the world. =Tributes= One week after the shooting, a citizen from Ciudad Ju√°rez, Jorge Luis Mart√≠nez Ch√°vez, ran a total of 22 miles, a mile for each of the people killed in the Walmart shooting (one additional victim died months later), starting at the Zaragoza bridge in Ju√°rez, Mexico, and finishing at the Walmart memorial in El Paso where the attack was perpetrated. =Walmart's reaction= Two days after the shooting, a Walmart corporate employee in the e-commerce division sent a memorandum to Walmart's entire e-commerce team (which includes thousands of employees) urging a \\"sick out\\" strike to force the corporation to stop selling guns. Walmart issued a statement that the company would not be altering any form of gun-sale policies within its stores. Walmart also sent out a memo instructing workers to remove signs and displays that \\"contain violent themes or aggressive behavior.\\" The company also pledged $400,000 for funds that were aimed at helping the victims of the mass shooting. On September 3, 2019, Walmart announced it will stop selling ammunition for handguns and some assault weapons in all of its American stores. The company also asked customers not to openly carry firearms into their stores.  Reactions  Terrorism experts, including Peter R. Neumann, cited the Great Replacement conspiracy theory as a common factor among several similar attacks. The Southern Poverty Law Center's Hatewatch blog linked the shooting with the earlier Christchurch mosque shootings and the Poway synagogue shooting, citing the similar white nationalist contents of the respective attackers' manifestos. Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation league, said that the shooting, as part of a series of similar attacks, indicated a \\"global threat\\" of white supremacy. NATO secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg urged countries to work together to prevent \\"lone wolf\\" attackers who find inspiration in one another's actions. Others, including the writer Daniel Okrent, disputed the \\"lone wolf\\" idea, pointing to the ways in which technology allows those with similar violent ideologies to congregate online. Several commentators attributed both the El Paso and Christchurch shootings to an ideology of eco-fascism. The Washington Post described the El Paso and Christchurch shootings as examples of an eco-fascist trend among white supremacists. Writing in GQ, Luke Darby referred to the \\"distinctly environmental theme\\" of Crusius' alleged manifesto. Jeet Heer in The Nation described the manifesto as being based in \\"Malthusian fascism\\", a worldview in which different races vie against one another in the face of environmental crises such as global warming. Mainstream environmentalists, including the executive director of the Sierra Club, denounced the attacker's alleged white-supremacist motivations. = United States = President Trump and the First Lady with the family and baby son of El Paso shooting victims Jordan and Andre Anchondo. President Donald Trump condemned the shooting as hateful and cowardly later that day. He promised that his administration would provide \\"total support\\". In a later statement, Trump announced after the shootings in El Paso and in Dayton, Ohio, that all US flags, both domestic and abroad, would be flown at half-staff until sunset on August 8. In a speech from the White House on August 5, Trump said: \\"In one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry and white supremacy. These sinister ideologies must be defeated. Hate has no place in America.\\" On August 7, Trump said he was \\"concerned about the rise of any group of hate\\", whether it was \\"white supremacy, whether it‚Äôs any other kind of supremacy, whether it's antifa\\". Within two days of the shooting, #WhiteSupremacistInChief reached the number one trend on Twitter as critics pointed out that statements in the suspect's alleged manifesto mirrored comments Trump had made in the past, including references to illegal immigration as an \\"invasion\\" and telling a group of minority congresswomen (all U.S. citizens) to \\"go back\\" to their home countries. Media outlets also highlighted an incident in May 2019 where an audience member at a campaign rally suggested shooting illegal migrants crossing the border, to which Trump responded with a joke, saying, \\"only in the Panhandle you can get away with that\\". Former president Barack Obama broke his self-imposed vow of silence on the new president's leadership to release the statement, \\"We should soundly reject language coming out of the mouths of any of our leaders that feeds a climate of fear and hatred or normalizes racist sentiments,\\" which has widely been interpreted as a criticism of Trump's specific rhetoric. Trump's remark that violent video games contributed to such mass shootings, a view echoed by other politicians such as House Minority Leader of the United States House of Representatives Kevin McCarthy and Texas Lt. Governor Dan Patrick, drew criticism from the video game industry, as past studies have found that no link exists between shootings and video games, and accused the government of using the medium as a scapegoat. Texas Senator John Cornyn and Trump meet with survivors U.S. Representative Veronica Escobar, who represents El Paso in Congress, brought a town hall meeting in the city to an early close following the shooting. Escobar later said there was also a hate epidemic, with domestic terrorism resulting from the dehumanization of others. Texas Senator Ted Cruz issued a written statement deploring \\"this unspeakable evil.\\" Beto O‚ÄôRourke, a native of El Paso who represented the city in Congress from 2013 to 2019, said he was \\"incredibly saddened\\" but that \\"The [El Paso] community is going to stay together. Everyone's resolved to make sure this doesn't continue to happen in this country.\\" Texas Governor Greg Abbott called the shooting \\"a heinous and senseless act of violence\\". Texas Senator John Cornyn said that gun violence would not be solved by focusing on law-abiding citizens. Texas Lt. Governor Dan Patrick said violent video games were partly to blame. Members of the Democratic Party, including several 2020 presidential candidates, criticized Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric in the wake of the shooting, including O'Rourke, Cory Booker, Joe Biden, and congresswoman Escobar. Other 2020 candidates called for political action to eliminate gun violence, including Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Andrew Yang. The incident also caused many celebrities and media figures to debate gun rights within the United States, with some condemning the perceived inaction of many political figures in stopping the large number of mass shootings in the country. That same evening, Moms Demand Action, which had a meeting planned in Washington, DC, led a march and vigil outside the White House in support of gun control in the United States and the ban of assault weapons. The day after the shooting, some prominent Republicans, including Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush, also spoke of the need to combat white-supremacist terrorism. Texas senator Ted Cruz decried the shooting as a \\"heinous act of terrorism and white supremacy\\". On Twitter, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein classified the attack as \\"white terrorism\\". Many Latinos interviewed by The New York Times said they felt disturbed at becoming targets of white- nationalist violence. Dan Stein, the president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), issued a statement on Twitter denouncing the shooting, with no mention of Crusius' alleged manifesto. The group regularly makes similar anti-immigration arguments to those contained in the document, prompting worries of political fallout from the shooting among FAIR and similar groups, according to David Nakamura in The Washington Post. Both Stein and Mark Krikorian of the Center for Immigration Studies, which also advocates restrictions on immigration, dismissed any connections between Crusius' ideology and their own. In response to the shooting, some 8chan users claimed that the shooter was \\"our guy\\". The purported manifesto of the shooter, after being deleted, was re-uploaded by some users, while others commented that it showed \\"zero effort\\", or claimed that it was fake. Following the attack, Cloudflare terminated its website security service for 8chan, commenting that \\"8chan has repeatedly proven itself to be a cesspool of hate\\". The site later went dark after its server rental provider Voxility discontinued its service. Trump visited El Paso and Dayton on August 7. The president and first lady also met with the mayors of El Paso and Dayton. In El Paso, protesters showed up at the site of the shooting, some claiming that Trump's attitude and statements had led to the shooting; Two days before the visit, congresswoman Escobar said that Trump was \\"not welcome\\" in the city and declined an invitation to meet with him. The White House published photos and a video of Trump's trip; in some photos, Trump was pictured smiling and giving thumbs up gestures, while the video was focused on Trump shaking hands and posing for photos. Trump said that he had an \\"amazing day\\" of visits, praising the \\"love, the respect for\\" him as president. = Mexico = News report from Notimex about the shooting and memorials Mexican president Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador extended his condolences to the families of the victims, both Americans and Mexicans. L√≥pez Obrador also criticized the \\"indiscriminate use of weapons\\" in the United States. The Mexican Secretariat of Foreign Affairs (SRE) identified the eight Mexican citizens killed, and the seven Mexican citizens wounded, in the attack. The Mexican victims killed in the attack came from Ciudad Ju√°rez, Chihuahua City, and Torre√≥n, Coahuila. Javier Corral Jurado, the governor of the Mexican state of Chihuahua, offered his assistance to Texas governor Greg Abbott and El Paso mayor Dee Margo, and said that Chihuahua authorities were ready to assist in any capacity if needed by the U.S. government. The Chihuahua government also directed Chihuahua residents and Mexican citizens affected by the attack to Mexico's Executive Committee for Victims (Spanish: Comisi√≥n Ejecutiva de Atenci√≥n a V√≠ctimas), and set up a phone line for Mexican citizens who needed assistance. The Mexican Consulate in El Paso provided consular assistance to Mexican nationals affected by the attack, and sent personnel to visit Mexican victims treated at the hospitals. The SRE confirmed that the consul Mauricio Ibarra Ponce de Le√≥n would coordinate with El Paso and Ciudad Ju√°rez officials. On August 4, Mexican Secretary of Foreign Affairs Marcelo Ebrard announced that Mexico would issue a formal charge against the suspect for terrorism against Mexican nationals should Mexico's Attorney General's Office (FGR) support it, and possibly request his extradition from the U.S. to Mexico to face those charges. If the suspect is charged with terrorism, it would be the first time in history that Mexico issues a criminal charge of this nature for a crime committed in the U.S. In addition, it would guarantee Mexico access to information about the case. Ebrard also stated that the Mexican government would remain in contact with the victims' families throughout the investigation and trial, and that they would press charges against the individual(s) or firm who sold the weapons to the suspect. Former Mexican president Felipe Calder√≥n offered his condolences on Twitter, and also directed a message against Trump. He said that notwithstanding if the attack was confirmed to be a hate crime or not, that Trump should stop his \\"hate speech\\" and \\"stigmatization\\". = International = UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres condemned \\"in the strongest terms the terrorist attack against Latinos on Saturday in the Texas city of El Paso\\" and called for everyone to work together to combat violence born of hate, racism and xenophobia. Recently the UN launched an action plan to \\"fight against discourses that incite hatred\\". The incident was mentioned by Pope Francis during a speech in St. Peter's Square on August 4, in which he condemned attacks on defenseless people and said he was spiritually close to the victims, the wounded, and the families affected by the attacks that had \\"bloodied Texas, California, and Ohio\\". The Gilroy Garlic Festival shooting happened in California around a week before the El Paso shooting, while the 2019 Dayton shooting occurred in Ohio less than 24 hours after. Uruguay and Venezuela issued travel warnings to avoid certain United States cities, including Baltimore, Detroit, Albuquerque, Cleveland, Memphis, and Oakland, citing \\"proliferation of acts of violence\\" and \\"growing indiscriminate violence, mostly for hate crimes, including racism and discrimination\\". Both countries warned their citizens to avoid any place with large crowds, including shopping malls, festivals, and \\"any kind of cultural or sporting events\\". Japan issued a similar travel warning, advising its citizens to pay attention to the potential for gunfire \\"everywhere\\" in the U.S., which they described as a \\"gun society\\". President Trump threatened undefined retaliation against countries and organizations that issue travel warnings on the United States because of gun violence.

Background and context  Polish Tatar soldiers in Battle of Grunwald painting Prior to World War II, the vast majority of Poland's Muslim population was Tatar, who had been present in Poland since the 14th century. However the boundary changes of the war left most of the Tatars outside of Poland, and this led the Polish Muslim community to be increasingly diverse.Narkowicz, Kasia, and Konrad Pƒôdziwiatr. \\"Saving and fearing Muslim women in ‚Äòpost-communist‚ÄôPoland: troubling Catholic and secular Islamophobia.\\" Gender, Place & Culture 24.2 (2017): 288-299. According to a 2015 estimate, Muslims in Poland are estimated to number between 25,000 to 40,000 people or some 0.1% of the population, and are composed of some 5,000 Lipka Tatars as well as more numerous recent immigrants. Initially the small Muslim community was treated equally unlike other minorities, Jews in particular, that have faced hostility and suspicion. During communist rule the censorship office barred unfavorable portrayals of Muslims due to Poland's geopolitical alignment with Arab countries during this period.Pƒôdziwiatr, Konrad. \\"The Catholic Church in Poland on Muslims and Islam.\\" Patterns of Prejudice 52.5 (2018): 461-478.

Islamophobia in Poland is related to Polish antisemitism, and arises as part of a continuing framework of othering and racism.The Everyday Politics of Migration Crisis in Poland: Between Nationalism, Fear and Empathy, Palgrave Macmillan, chapter by Krzysztof Jaskulowski, 2019, pages 31-53 While Islamophobia is based on Western Orientalism, in its expression it evokes prior antisemitic canards. Traditional Polish national identity formed in comparison to the \\"strange Jew\\" and in modern expression of Islamophobia Muslims fulfill a similar function of a \\"Muslim Other\\" who stands opposed to the Polish ingroup. According to historian Jan T. Gross, the root of hostility to Muslim refugees in East European countries generally and Poland specifically is connected to the failure to come to terms with their role in the Holocaust and specifically complicity with the Nazis.Remembering the Second World War, Routledge, page 249, chapter by Jie-Hyun LimKalmar, Ivan. \\"‚ÄòThe battlefield is in Brussels‚Äô: Islamophobia in the Visegr√°d Four in its global context.\\" Patterns of Prejudice 52.5 (2018): 406-419. After World War 2, The Muslim Religious Association grew leading to the eventual migration of Muslim Arab students to Poland during the 1970s and 80s. Immigration of Poles to the United Kingdom has led many migrants from the homogeneous Polish society to encounter a culturally diverse setting for the first time. This contact, coupled with continued contact with family members in Poland, has led to a transnational transfer of Islamophobia back into Poland.Gawlewicz, A. and Narkowicz, K. (2015) Islamophobia on the move: circulation of anti-Muslim prejudice between Poland and the UK. In: Suleiman, Y. (ed.) Muslims in the UK and Europe I. Centre of Islamic Studies, University of Cambridge: Cambridge, pp. 90-100. While Islamophobia existed previously in Poland, in connection to Polish casualties in the War on Terror and mosque construction in 2010 and 2012, the 2015 European migrant crisis made Islamophobia a central issue. In conjunction, xenophobic attitudes increased in Poland including antisemitism and Islamophobia.Narkowicz, Kasia. \\"‚ÄòRefugees Not Welcome Here‚Äô: State, Church and Civil Society Responses to the Refugee Crisis in Poland.\\" International Journal of Politics, Culture, and Society 31.4 (2018): 357-373.How big an issue is Islamophobia in Poland?, Shafik Mandhai, Al Jazeera, 14 November 2017 As of 2018 Poland exhibits one of the highest rates of Islamophobia in Europe.  Polls  An anti-Islamic protest in Poland According to a 2011 poll, 47% of Poles stated that \\"too many Muslims live in Poland\\", and 62% stated that \\"Islam is an intolerant religion\\", the highest rate of the eight countries surveyed in the poll. A 2017 poll of Polish secondary school pupils showed that the majority expressed strong homophobic, anti-refugee, and Islamophobic prejudice.Bayrakli, Enes, and Farid Hafez. \\"The state of islamophobia in Europe.\\" European Islamophobia report 2017 Between January and October 2017, 664 anti-Muslim hate crime proceedings were started in Poland, of which 193 proceeded to an indictment. Muslims were the most targeted group, and some 20% of all recorded hate crimes were directed at Muslims. Whereas the normal age distribution of prejudice is tilted towards older people, the opposite is true in Poland: A 2015 opinion poll showed 59 percent of 18 to 24 years associated Islam with dangers contrasted with 37 percent of those older than 65. According to a 2016 poll, Poles significantly overestimate the size of the small Muslim community, believing that there are 2.6 million Muslims in Poland and that the Muslim population is expected to increase to 5 million (13 percent of the population) by 2020. In a 2018 poll of Catholic seminary students, 75 percent said they had no contact with Muslims. On a negative/positive scale of +50 to -50, students placed Catholicism at 44, Orthodox Christianity at 23, Islam at -8.4, and Jehovah's Witnesses at -10.2. 80 percent responded that Islam encourages violence, a notion that extends to individual Muslims which 80 percent viewed as more aggressive than non- Muslims. Almost 80 percent of future priests indicated that Muslims mistreat Women. Some 44 percent supported (partially or fully) the banning of Islam in Poland. According to a 2016 study, many Poles incorrectly believe every Muslim is Arab and that vice versa every Arab is Muslim. 48% of Arab respondents said they experience racism in Poland and 26% said they were physically assaulted. Despite this hostility, Arab respondents think that while some Poles are racist, most are not.Switat, Mustafa. \\"Arabic Community in Poland‚ÄìFacts and Myths.\\" Yearbook of Polish European Studies 19 (2016): 249-260.

Mosques  Historic wooden Kruszyniany Mosque, used by Lipka Tatar community, and targeted by an Islamophobic attack in 2014 In 2010 the planned the first purpose-built mosque in Warsaw in the Ochota district. A group called Europe of the Future () organized protests against construction, framing their opposition in terms of \\"European values\\" of freedom of expression, secularism, democratic ideals, and women's rights. Prior to the protest, the group distributed posters resembling prior Swiss posters with a niqab clad woman and minarets resembling missiles.Narkowicz, Kasia, and Konrad Pƒôdziwiatr. \\"From unproblematic to contentious: mosques in Poland.\\" Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies 43.3 (2017): 441-457.Hafez, Farid. \\"Street-level and government-level Islamophobia in the Visegr√°d Four countries.\\" Patterns of Prejudice 52.5 (2018): 436-447. In 2012, the Ahmadiyya community attempted to build a mosque in the W≈Çochy district of Warsaw. Europa Przysz≈Ço≈õci, who were the main opponents of the Ochota mosque, declared they would not protest as they viewed the Ahmadiyya community as peaceful. However, local councilors opposed the mosque construction, and most of the neighborhood signed a petition organized by Law and Justice councilors. The local council rejected the plan in 2013. While much of the opposition to the mosque employed spatial planning concerns, a subtext of resentment towards Muslims was evident in the debate as well as in the council's rejection letter which noted that \\"the construction of a culturally foreign object is a reason for concern regarding the loss of value of the estates in W≈Çochy\\". The Ochota mosque, the first in Warsaw, was finally opened before the Ramadan of 2015, a turning point in Polish Islamic history. However, the mosque had been faced with hostilities since construction, including an incident it was shot at and the tossing of a pig's head into the building after it opened. Furthermore, a wave of attacks against Polish mosques accompanied construction, including notably the drawing of a pig's head on the Kruszyniany Mosque of the Tatar community who had previously lived in Poland for hundreds of years without hostilities directed at them.  Women  Traditionally Lipka Tatar women did not wear the hijab, making the visibility of Muslim women in Polish society a recent trend. This visibility has made Muslim women targets of Islamophobia by two camps: right-wing Catholicism and a secular liberal camp. While these two camps share little in common value, the Islamophobic expression towards the bodies of Muslim women is shared, both camps stating that Muslim women face oppression.Narkowicz, Kasia, and Konrad Pƒôdziwiatr. \\"Saving and fearing Muslim women in ‚Äòpost-communist‚ÄôPoland: troubling Catholic and secular Islamophobia\\" Gender, Place & Culture 24.2 (2017): 288-299. In Polish Islamophobic discourse, veiled Muslim women are symbolized as threatening in conjunction with the narrative that the women themselves are oppressed. The gendered anti- Muslim narratives in Poland is a version of \\"gendered exceptionalism\\" similar to that prevalent in Western countries in which the patriarchy of the ingroup is minimized while the patriarchy of the outgroup is emphasized.  Political parties  alt= alt= = Law and Justice = Following the European migration crisis, migration has become a central issue in Polish politics. The ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party has adopted the discourse typical of the far-right in Europe. PiS has linked national security with migration, and connected refugees with Muslims. Utilizing earlier antisemitic tropes, PiS normalized biological and cultural racism, with Muslims facing racial othering. In their statements, PiS politicians used falsified data and differentiated between refugees and so called economic migrants which had wholly negative connotations. Following the 2015 Polish parliamentary election, PiS cemented control of public media and utilized Islamophobic rhetoric to rally its supporters. The mainstreaming of Islamophobic discourse may lend legitimacy to physical violence versus the \\"racialized Other\\".Jaskulowski, Krzysztof, and Marek Pawlak. \\"Migration and Lived Experiences of Racism: The Case of High- Skilled Migrants in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland.\\" International Migration Review (2019): 0197918319839947. = Extreme right = While in other countries, such as the Czech Republic, there have been positive relations between the extreme right and Islamism, in Poland this is rare. In the 2006, League of Polish Families's MP Wojciech Wierzejski wrote a blog entry titled \\"Resistance to Islam\\" which was criticized by the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights.Mare≈°, Miroslav. \\"The extreme right's relationship with Islam and Islamism in East-Central Europe: From allies to enemies.\\" East European Politics and Societies 28.1 (2014): 205-224. In 2007 a branch of Stop Islamisation of Europe was established in Poland, and from 2010 the conservative Europe of the Future led by Jan W√≥jcik and the Euroislam.pl portal led by Piotr Slusarczyk have become vocal. Islamophobic groups like the \\"Polish Defense League\\" were formed to defend Polish honor and prevent Polish women from being seduced by Muslim men. During 2015 elections, the KORWiN party ran an openly racist advertisement titled \\"The invasion has started\\" showing aggressive dark-skinned men coupled with derogatory statements and world map in which white marked parts succumbed to a black invasion.  Media  On public television, guests have spoken of Muslims as uncivilized and a threat to European and Christian values and have described them as violent: as Jihadists, terrorists, and rapists. Piela and ≈Åukjanowicz contend that guests they say engage in anti-Muslim rhetoric‚ÄîMiriam Shaded (director of the Estera Foundation), Tomasz Terlikowski, Wojciech Cejrowski, Marcin Rola, Witold Gadwoski and Dariusz Oko‚Äîare \\"handpicked\\" by the networks.Anna Paela and Anna ≈Åukjanowicz. \\"The state of islamophobia in Europe.\\" Islamophobia in Poland report 2017 pp. 464-482 One evening program on TVP‚ÄîAfter Eight‚Äîhas hosted guests overtly hostile to Islam, one of whom referred to the Qur'an as a Satanic book \\"about hatred and intolerance\\" in contrast to the Bible, which the guest called \\"a book about love\\". While the moderate wing of the Catholic Church has espoused tolerance, the opinions of those closer to the conservative wing of the Church, expressed in Fronda.pl and Polonia Christiana (PCh24.pl), have been significant in their contribution to the stereotyping of refugees and Muslims. In 2016, the right-wing wSieci magazine ran a cover with a white women assaulted by dark males under the title \\"The Islamic rape of Europe\\" which evoked outrage,Polish magazine's 'Islamic rape of Europe' cover sparks outrage, The Guardian, 16 February 2016 and has been compared to WWII propaganda with the same imagery.The so-called 'Islamic rape of Europe' is part of a long and racist history, Washington Post, 16 February 2016 According to Jaskulowski, the more liberal Polish media (Polityka and Gazeta Wyborcza) opposed the right-wing discourse of fear and focused in some instances on the human aspect of the immigration story, but have also used spoken of a \\"flood\\" and a \\"wave\\". Jaskulowksi writes that Polish identity rap evokes aggressive nationalist sentiments while avoiding the anti-Semitic tropes of national rock, and that it has received the support of state institutions and right-wing media. Some artists, like , have adapted their style to become known as \\"identity rappers\\", and have found themselves consulted \\"as experts on national identity\\" on public television. One video in the genre was so extreme it was deleted from Youtube as hate speech (after having been viewed 300,000 times).  Role of the Catholic Church  With some 90% of Poles defining themselves as Catholic, the role of the Catholic Church is unique as the public's faith in the church is strong and the church itself wields significant political power.Kalmar, Ivan. \\"Islamophobia in the East of the European Union: an introduction.\\" (2018): 389-405. Highly valued in Poland, the Church has a significant impact on social issues. Polish nationalism and Catholicism are intertwined as part of a process of in which the Polish nation is sacralized. Despite modernization, Poland remains a religious country, with 43% of Polish adults regularly attending church. While Pope Francis has called for Catholic communities to aid refugees, this call has not been well received in Poland. Some Polish bishops have questioned the papal call, and some younger priests have taken an active role in anti-Muslim and anti-refugee protests. This has contributed to Islamophobia moving from the fringes to mainstream discourse in Poland. Whereas in other Western countries Islamophobia has been linked with concerns of public displays of faith by Muslims, in Poland it has been connected to the Catholic church and the notion of European re-Christianization. The othering of Muslims is used to rally the faithful around \\"Christian\\" values in order to halt the imagined \\"conquest of Europe\\" by Islam. One of the key targets of Catholic Islamophobic narratives is Muslim women. Within this narrative, Muslim women are seen as reproducers of the faith, a message that fits within the Church's emphasis on reproductive politics. The Polish Catholic church is composed of two camps: authoritarian, nationalist, traditionalist Catholicism and open post-conciliar Catholicism. While the leaders of the Church expressed themselves in the discourse of the open church, they also evoked the terrorist threat of the religious other. Furthermore, the church leaders endorsed a \\"help them where they are\\" (in refugee camps outside Poland) approach towards refugees, which was adopted by the ruling PiS party. A small group, connected to the liberal and low-circulation Tygodnik Powszechny and Wiƒô≈∫ publications, expressed true open church sentiments criticizing the restrained approach of the Church hierarchy and the anti-refugee bishops. The opposing traditionalist bishop criticized the Church hierarchy as well, and expressed Islamophobic clich√©s. Archbishop Henryk Hoser stated that jihadists controlled the migration and that communities of refugees would be a \\"perfect breeding ground for the recruitment of fanatics\\".

He played organ for the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field in Chicago, Illinois. On Saturday, May 25, 2019, Pressy reached his 2,633-consecutive played game; never having missed a day in 33 years. He retired at the end of the 2019 season. Early life Pressy knew he wanted to play organ for a sports team, especially a major league team, since he was 5-years old. He began playing the organ as a young boy in the Ashburn area of Chicago, near St. Thomas More Church. Pressy would often imitate the organists he would hear on the radio during broadcast games. Watching the World Series on television, he thought to himself: ‚ÄúBoy, I‚Äôd like to do that! ‚Äù Pressy played the organ throughout his school days at St. Laurence High School in Chicago, graduating in 1975. He continued private organ studies with Russ Caifano while in college and began sending out resumes to area teams who may have been in need of an organist. John McDonough hired him to play for the Chicago Sting soccer club. When McDonough transferred to the Chicago Cubs organization in 1987, Pressy went with him. Of Pressy, McDonough says: ‚ÄúThe one thing that struck me with Gary was he was so reliable. Those jobs are important. It‚Äôs hard to have a backup for the organist. He gets along with everybody. He‚Äôs a craftsman.‚Äù Career Wrigley Field was the first Major League ballpark to have organ music on April 26, 1941. Pressy was hired in 1987. He marks the 2016 Chicago Cubs World Series as one of his most cherished highlights of his career. On August 28, 2017, Pressy tweeted: Big homestand starts tonight, but special night as it's my 2500th consecutive game as organist at WF. Thank you fans! - GP.

The streak would surpass Baltimore Orioles‚Äô Cal Ripken Jr.'s Hall of Fame consecutive games-played on the field (2,632). Pressy spoke of the achievement and comparison in an April 2019 interview stating: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a whole different ballgame, pardon the pun ‚Ä¶ but it is flattering that they even mention that.‚Äù As of July 2019, Pressy has played for 2,653 games. Ballgame music Regarding the famous ‚Äú7th inning stretch‚Äù, for years legendary sportscaster Harry Caray would sing Take Me Out to the Ballgame. After Caray died in February 1998, various singers and celebrities would guest appear to lead the crowd in singing the song. Pressy cites Mike Ditka‚Äôs performance on July 4th, 1998 as his most memorable accompaniment. Others include Ozzy Osbourne, who Pressy still says to this day he [Ozzy] ‚Äúsang it backwards ‚Ä¶ but he did sing at the end: \\"let‚Äôs get some runs!‚Äù, and Vin Scully: ‚ÄúHe nailed it.‚Äù Pressy, an avid baseball fan himself, knows the game inside and out: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll know when a batter has three balls on him and the next pitch could be a walk, so you are going to need to play a walking song. And you have to just know things like how you don‚Äôt play when the pitcher is about to throw the ball. There are a lot of rules that you have to follow.‚Äù For 26 years, Pressy would play specifically assigned ‚Äúwalk-up‚Äù music for each player, saying: ‚Äúit was fun to choose songs based on a player's number, their names or their hometowns.‚Äù When the Cubs retired catcher Buster Posey, Pressy played the theme to Ghostbusters. For Cubs pitcher Kerry Wood's last game on May 18, 2012, Pressy played My Way as Woods left the mound. For pitcher Tom Gorzelanny, Pressy performed the Marist High School‚Äôs fight song whenever he entered the game. In 2016, a big screen was introduced along with a DJ. Pressy adapted to the new format by updating his repertoire to include such artists as Lady Gaga, Bruno Mars, Katy Perry, etc. ‚ÄúYou try to do different types of styles ‚Ä¶‚Äù, Pressy says, ‚ÄúThe one thing about the fans, there‚Äôs all different types of people who come to the ballpark.

The Cubs created a special bobblehead of Pressy seated at the Wrigley organ to commemorate 30 years with the organization. Pressy awards fans with the one- of-a-kind prize who answer trivia questions correctly on his Twitter account during games. Today, organs at baseball stadiums have been made redundant in exchange for canned music.

It is a cruciform building, exhibiting features of neoclassical and baroque architecture, with an elaborate east-facing facade, and north and south transepts with stained glass windows. Originally designed by Walter Lovi and William Robertson in the early 1830s, its large copper dome was added in 1916 by Charles M√©nart, who also remodelled the interior. It has been designated a Category A listed building. Description St Thomas's is sited in a prominent location on Chapel Street in Keith, facing toward Reidhaven Square, amongst the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century buildings of Keith's new town area. Incorporating elements of neoclassical and baroque design, it has a cruciform shape, with an elaborate east front, made of polished ashlar sandstone, and rubble in flanks and rear. Walker and Woodworth describe St Thomas's as \\"the grandest and most prominent Catholic church in Moray,\\" and Charles McKean describes its facade as \\"the best in the area.\\" =Exterior= The east front is based on the design of Santa Maria della Vittoria in Rome. It has three bays, separated by pilasters, the central one advanced slightly. The side bays, topped with volutes and finials, have corniced central panels which have inset round-topped niches housing statues. The pedimented entrance is in the central bay. An inscription reads Columna et Firmamentum Veritatis. Behind the east front, where the transepts meet the nave, is a large, octagonally faceted copper dome, with oval windows in each face. The dome is made of concrete, covered with sheets of copper, and is topped with a cross finial. The sides and rear of the church are much simpler than the front. Made of granite rubble, each of the transepts has three round-arched windows at their gable ends, and there are lean-to side aisles with rectangular windows. The western end of the building serves as a presbytery, with two storeys and bay windows. The church sits on a relatively restricted plot of land; there is no graveyard, and only a small garden, in which there is a wooden gazebo. =Interior= The classical Greek cross-form interior is dominated by the central dome, which is painted with a pattern of gold stars on a dark blue background. Regularly spaced Corinthian pilasters and plaster-cast cornices line the walls of the nave and the sanctuary. The nave and transepts are lined with oak pews, and focused on the shallow chancel at the west end. This contains the high altar, behind which, in a pedimented aedicule, is a painting of the incredulity of St Thomas by Fran√ßois Dubois. The altar itself is of stone, and has three carved panels depicting the Madonna and Child with angels on either side, below a tabernacle. At the east end of the nave, close to the entrance, is a small gallery, housing a pipe organ, which is accessed via a marble-floored vestibule. There is also a chapel dedicated to St John Ogilvie, who was born nearby. =Windows= St Thomas's has a number of stained glass windows. The main window in the north transept gable is a war memorial, dated 1918, depicting the crucifixion. The corresponding window in the south transept, signed by J.H. Maum√©jean Fr√®res of Paris, shows Christ the Good Shepherd. Each of these main windows is flanked by two smaller windows, dating to the 1970s, by Dom Ninian Sloane of Pluscarden Abbey. History The church was designed by Walter Lovi, a Catholic priest and architect, and William Robertson, a well-regarded architect based in Elgin. It was intended to replace the cottage and chapel at Kempcairn that had been used by the local Catholic congregation prior to the 1829 emancipation of Catholics in Scotland. The construction was paid for using money collected by Lovi on a European fund-raising trip, during which Charles X, the King of France, donated the painting by Dubois of St Thomas, which forms the altarpiece. It was opened for worship on 1 August 1831, but work continued on the building until it was completed in 1832. In 1916, the interior was extensively renovated, and the large dome added, by Charles M√©nart. Wood from the campanile, which had been in its place originally, was used to build the gazebo currently present in the church's garden. It was designated a Category B listed building in 1972, and upgraded to Category A in 1988. It underwent repairs and restoration in 1996, carried out by Oliver Humphries partners. Current usage The church is still an active place of worship, presided over by its dean, Father Colin Stuart. There are Masses every day except Wednesdays, and confessions are heard on Fridays.

It runs for from Lelant on Cornwall‚Äôs north coast to St Michael‚Äôs Mount on the south coast. History Established in 1994, the route follows a path likely taken by early Christian pilgrims, missionaries and travellers from Ireland and Wales that would have enabled them to travel southwards towards Continental European sites of pilgrimage whilst avoiding the perilous journey by sea around the southwestern tip of Britain. Description of route St Michael's Way has been signposted and waymarked in both directions using a stylistic shell based on the Council of Europe's sign for pilgrim routes. The directional arrows are coloured yellow for footpaths, blue for bridleways and red for byways; Cornwall Council has chosen to use black arrows on public roads. Pilgrims arriving at the Pilgrim's Office at Santiago de Compostela Cathedral who have walked St Michael's Way as well as the Camino Ingl√©s from La Coru√±a may be awarded the Compostela certificate of accomplishment on production of a suitably stamped Credencial. Approximately a third of the route coincides with the South West Coast Path National Trail: specifically, the initial segment from Lelant to the western end of Carbis Bay, and the final segment from Eastern Green to Marazion and St Michael's Mount. St Michael‚Äôs Way is named and shown as a series of green diamonds on the Ordnance Survey 1:25000 scale map, although it is not indicated on the 1:50000 scale map. The full route involves a significant westward excursion from Ludgvan church to Gulval church, then returning eastwards from Eastern Green (near Penzance) to Marazion along the Long Rock beach segment of the coast path. There is a shorter alternative route (also waymarked) southwards between Ludgvan church and Marazion that reduces the trail length by approximately ; however, the shorter route is riskier as it involves crossing the A30 and A394 roads without the assistance of designated pedestrian crossings, as well as crossing the Penzance-to-St Erth railway line at a pedestrian level crossing.

There is an events space on the ground floor and above it a separate housing group. History  Vrankrijk as a printers in 1880 The building was constructed in 1875. It was called Vrankrijk (Frankrijk means 'France' in Dutch) from the very beginning. After first being a woodworking shop, it became a printers. During World War II it was used by Marten Toonder and others to print fake documents for the resistance. Occupation Vrankrijk was squatted in November 1982 in order to stop its demolition. It had stood empty for 7 years and was in a very bad state. It was repaired by the occupiers and became a central meeting space for the Amsterdam squatters movement, still thriving after the coronation and Vondelstraat riots of 1980. In 1991, the owner of the building at first threatened to evict the squatters and then offered to sell them the building. The first offer was rejected but after the owner's workplace was occupied by 50 people, he stated he would sell the building if certain conditions were met. Uses Since 1984, the groundfloor functions as a non-commercial events space. Many groups have organised benefits and infonights there. The venue, which is separate to the living spaces above it, remains squatted. In the 2010s, Vrankrijk hosts mainly punk and queer parties. The building itself is well-known in Amsterdam for its colourful facade and anarchist slogans beside the door. The German NGO Sea-Watch, which supports the rescue of migrants in the Mediterranean, uses Vrankrijk as its official location. In September 2008, an incident occurred late at night in which two people were thrown out of the bar. When they tried to re-enter Vrankrijk, they were aggressive and caused a fight. One of the two, a squatter nicknamed Yoghurt, ended up unconscious and received serious injuries. In consequence Mayor of Amsterdam Job Cohen closed the bar. In 2009, two people were sentenced to two years in jail (8 months suspended) for attacking Yoghurt with a piece of scaffolding pipe. A third person was not punished, since the court decided he had hit Yoghurt but his violence was proportionate. The bar reopened in 2012, run by a new collective (Stichting Twee√´nveertig). The mayor, Eberhard van der Laan made the conditions that all the people involved in the previous incident were excluded and that the collective had to make a business plan. European Council protests The 1997 European Council meeting occurred in Amsterdam on 16 and 17 June, resulting in the Treaty of Amsterdam. On Sunday 15 June, a large police operation targeted Vrankrijk, which was a base for the planned counter-demonstrations. Police filmed everyone entering and leaving the building. Some people were arrested and charged with membership of a criminal organisation. Later on, a group of 350 people left Vrankrijk, heading to the police station to support the arrestees. The entire group was arrested and charged with the same crime, making it the largest mass arrest in the Netherlands since 1966. Vrankrijk itself was not raided. A judge was later highly critical of the actions of the police. Juanra Juan Ram√≥n Rodr√¨guez Fern√°ndez was arrested on January 17 2001 in an Amsterdam supermarket by Dutch police acting on a Eurojust request from the Spanish Guardia Civil related to investigations concerning the Basque group ETA. Fern√°ndez, known as Juanra, was singer in the Barcelona hardcore band KOP. The police then raided Vrankrijk with 200 officers, checking all 14 bedrooms despite only having a warrant to search where Fern√°ndez had been staying.

Biography Jawahar was the son of Manna Singh Aulakh, and the brother of the future Maharani Jind Kaur, whose son Maharajah Duleep Singh he was appointed guardian and tutor of. He was eventually superseded as Duleep's tutor by Lal Singh, who was appointed by Wazir Hira Singh. Hira Singh later had Jawahar imprisoned on suspicion of making treasonous overtures to the East India Company, and during his imprisonment he was beaten and tortured by a Brahmin named Jodha Ram. Upon Hira Singh's fall from power, Jawahar, Lal Singh, and Gulab Singh all put themselves forwards for the position of Wazir; the Maharani selected her brother as Wazir on 14 May 1845. He held the position only briefly, during a tumultuous nine months in which he persecuted those who had antagonised him in the past, including Jodha Ram, who was mutilated. A heavy drinker, Jawahar distrusted and was distrusted by the Sikh Khalsa Army, and relied more upon the troops of Alexander Gardner. The killing of Jawahar Singh on 21 September 1845, as portrayed in The Illustrated London News His most significant action was his alleged ordering of the murder of the rebel Prince Pashaura Singh, which was carried out after Pashaura had been offered safe conduct and surrendered. The Khalsa believed that Jawahar had personally ordered the death, fearing that the prince presented too great a threat to young Duleep Singh. The leaders of the Khalsa demanded he present himself before them on 21 September 1845, which he did after much prevarication and attempts at bribery.Malleson, George Bruce (1914) The Decisive Battles of India: From 1746 to 1849 Inclusive.

Jawahar met with the Khalsa on the appointed date, with an escort of elephants and people including the Maharani, and the Maharaja himself seated beside him, in an attempt to ensure his own safety. The soldiers, however, removed the escort and dragged away the Maharani, causing Jawahar to panic: Duleep was pulled out of his arms and taken to the Maharani, and the Wazir was bayoneted, dragged from his elephant, and speared to death, supposedly being stabbed fifty times.Keay, John (2017) The Tartan Turban: In Search of Alexander Gardner.

He was Professor of Physics at MIT, a leader in the study of quantum field theories and the quark substructure of matter. Johnson contributed to the understanding of symmetry and anomalies in quantum field theories and to models of quark confinement and dynamics in quantum chromodynamics.  Biography  = Early life = Ken Johnson was a student at Case Western Reserve University and obtained his bachelor's degree from the Illinois Institute of Technology in 1952. He studied theoretical physics at Harvard University, completing his Ph. D. under the direction of Julian Schwinger in 1955. Johnson remained at Harvard as a Research Fellow and Lecturer from 1955 through 1957 and during 1957-1958 he was an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow at the Institute for Theoretical Physics (Niels Bohr Institute), Copenhagen. = Career at MIT = Johnson was appointed to the MIT faculty in 1958 as Assistant Professor, promoted to Associate Professor in 1961, and to Full Professor in 1965. Johnson remained at MIT, with the exception of visiting positions at SLAC (1971‚Äì72, 1980‚Äì81), University of Washington (1972), and Nordita (1981), for the remainder of his career. Early in his career, Johnson together with Marshall Baker (University of Washington) undertook a systematic study of the short distance and high energy behavior of quantum electrodynamics (QED), which presaged modern studies of renormalization group flow and the search for ultraviolet fixed points of the QED ùõΩ-function. Johnson was one of the first to discover chiral and other anomalies in gauge-field theories, anticipating the work of Stephen Adler (IAS), John Bell (CERN), and Roman Jackiw (MIT) on chiral anomalies. Continuing his study of anomalies, Johnson, collaborating with Frances Low (MIT), introduced limiting methods for studying the short distance behavior of operator products. Similar methods were introduced by James Bjorken (SLAC). The Bjorken-Johnson-Low Limit was used extensively in the study of scaling and perturbative anomalies in the late 1960s and was subsumed into the more general framework of the operator product expansion by Kenneth Wilson. Working with Jackiw, Johnson showed that gauge invariance could break down dynamically in a theory with massless fermions but without fundamental scalar particles, leading to mass generation for both the fermions and the gauge bosons. This work formed the foundation for technicolor theories of compositeness beyond the Standard Model. In the early 1970s Johnson became interested in the confinement of quarks in theories of hadron structure. He led a collaboration with Alan Chodos, Robert Jaffe, Charles Thorn, and Victor Weisskopf (all MIT) in the development of a relativistic, gauge invariant, and heuristic model of quark confinement known as the ‚ÄúMIT Bag Model‚Äù, which emerged as a standard model for describing hadrons in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The MIT Bag Model provided a framework for the initial investigation of many aspects of the behavior of confined quarks and gluons in QCD. In several of these studies, Johnson played a leading role. Together with Thomas DeGrand (University of Colorado), Joseph Kiskis (UC Davis), and Jaffe, Johnson showed that the spectra of light-quark baryons and mesons could be accommodated in QCD. With Thorn, Johnson demonstrated the emergence of string-like excitations of hadrons in QCD, and Johnson and Jaffe explored the spectra and interactions of exotic hadrons composed purely of gluons or made of more than three quarks. Studies of such unusual hadrons remains a topic of current experimental and theoretical interest. In his later years, Johnson focused on finding a heuristic description of the gluon field configurations that dominate the confining condensate in the QCD vacuum, a search that continues to this day.  Personal life  Ken Johnson was married to Gladys (Diaz de los Arcos) Johnson, who also studied physics at Harvard in the early 1950s. Gladys was an accomplished artist. They had one son, Keith Johnson.

It was first issued as a series of eight (later eleven) stories, most of which were first published between 1975 and 1998. Plots =\\"The Means of Escape\\"= The story is set in the mid-19th- century, in the penal colony of Van Diemen's Land. Alice Godley, daughter of the rector of the English Church in Hobart, lives a constrained life doing little apart from working in the local laundry and playing the seraphine in her father's church. She lives quietly at the rectory with her father, two lodgers, and the housekeeper Mrs Watson. Mrs Watson was originally a transported convict who, having served seven years, now has her ticket of leave. One day, alone in the church, Alice is surprised by an escaped prisoner in felon‚Äôs clothing and hood who tells her that he is an educated man, a poisoner by the name of Savage. Although fearful, she feels herself attracted to him and agrees to hide him in the church, bringing him food over several days. Savage tells her that he needs women's clothes to make good his escape on the next ship bound for England, and they arrange for him to come to her house under cover of darkness. He tells her that when he reaches England he will invite her to join him there. Alice waits expectantly all night, but Savage does not appear. Eight months later, Alice receives a letter from England. Savage says that in the darkness that night he had mistaken her room, and had accidentally gone into that of Mrs Watson. The housekeeper had welcomed him, provided him with the necessary clothes, and decided on the spur of the moment to accompany him to England herself. =\\"The Axe\\"= The story is narrated by a bureaucratic middle-manager of a small firm, who has been forced by the firm's owner to make his ageing clerical assistant, WS Singlebury, redundant. Singlebury lives alone, has worked for years in the same small cubbyhole, and says that he does not know what he will do if he is forced to leave. A damp smell that has been permeating the office for some time gets worse after Singlebury's departure, becoming a putrid stench. Returning late at night to his office after accidentally leaving the lights on, the narrator feels a sense of creeping tension. Shuffling along the corridor to his cubbyhole is Singlebury, with his throat cut from ear to ear. The narrator retreats into his office, locks himself in, and sits writing a report on the incident, unable to bring himself to look behind him to see whether there is blood seeping under the door. =\\"The Red-Haired Girl\\"= A group of young English artists travel to Paris in 1882 to practise plein air painting. One of the group, Hackett, searches for a female model and finds at his hotel the ideal candidate: a young red-haired servant girl called Annik, with a blank expression, \\"built for hard use and hard wear\\". He engages her, and tells her to come to be painted at specific time, wearing a red shawl. She will be paid once the painting is complete. Over several sessions, Hackett becomes increasingly frustrated and angry with Annik, not understanding that her poverty means that she has no way of accurately determining the time, has no shawl of her own and no friend from whom she could borrow one. She complains \\"you don't know what I want, and you don't know what I feel\\". Hackett realises that he knows nothing of Annik‚Äôs heart, but his realisation comes too late and Annik has disappeared. Initially he fears that she may have killed herself, but ultimately discovers from one of the servants that she has been dismissed for stealing from the hotel - some money, and a watch. =\\"Beehernz\\"= Hopkins, the artistic director of a music festival, plans to bring back out of retirement an old maestro, Beehernz, for one last Mahler concert. Taking with him Mary, a young soprano, he travels to Beehernz‚Äôs retreat on a small island off Iona. There they discover Beehernz living alone in an old house with no electricity, no radio, no books, no bookcase, no scores or manuscripts. In the kitchen is a broken piano that makes no sound. Beehernz is cryptic and evasive, showing little interest in the contract that Hopkins has bought with him and no interest in Mahler. Overhearing Mary in the kitchen singing German lieder quietly to herself while making the tea, Beehernz insists that she be taken straight back to Iona. Hopkins spends an uncomfortable night in an armchair, and is surprised in the morning to find Beehernz not only dressed but ready to accompany him. Beehernz explains that he has changed his mind, and that he would like to hear Mary sing again: \\"You see, it is so long since I heard music\\". =\\"The Prescription\\"= Dr Mehmet Bey, a prosperous Turkish doctor in the Beyazit area of Istanbul, takes on 14-year-old Alecco as an apprentice as an act of compassion. But Mehmet Bey resents the fact that his apprentice is very bright, and as Alecco is of lowly Greek nationality he is not permitted to do anything that would allow him to learn about medicine. After discovering the boy reading his books without permission, an incensed Mehmet Bey forces him to drink a poisoned prescription, which almost kills him. Alecco leaves, and is picked up on the waterfront by a Greek cook who finds him a place on a ship bound for London. Many years later, Alecco - now an experienced young doctor who has studied with the greatest specialist in Vienna - is asked to provide a second opinion on one of Mehmet Bey‚Äôs cases. Mehmet Bey listens to Alecco‚Äôs diagnosis and instantly rejects it, questioning Alecco‚Äôs honesty and telling him that in spite of all his education his nature cannot not have changed. Alecco withdraws his diagnosis. =\\"At Hiruharama\\"= Tanner travels from England to New Zealand hoping to take up an apprenticeship, but finds that he has to accept a job as a servant. There he meets and courts Kitty, also a servant from England who had had hopes of employment as a governess. Tanner asks Kitty to wait three years, while he saves his wages, and they are then married. Still lacking funds, they settle in a remote spot in the countryside, Hiruharama, where their nearest neighbour - an eccentric man called Brinkman - lives nine or ten miles away. Brinkman calls over for dinner once every six months. Kitty becomes pregnant and Tanner makes arrangements to summon the doctor via carrier pigeon when she goes into labour. When the doctor arrives, Kitty has already given birth, and he discovers that Tanner has accidentally thrown out the smaller of his twin daughters, mistaking her for the afterbirth. Brinkman arrives for his dinner and makes no effort to leave, sitting quietly by the table, smoking his pipe. He reasons that his hosts will have to serve dinner sometime. =\\"Not Shown\\"= Fothergill is employed by Lady P. as a poorly-paid caretaker at Tailfirst farm, an Arts and Crafts building by Philip Webb that is shown to the public on Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays. Assisting him are two longstanding rooms stewards. Hearing that Fothergill has recently appointed a disruptive new steward, Mrs Horrabin, Lady P. calls her employee in and instructs him to dispense with her services. Fothergill‚Äôs mind returns to the preceding Tuesday when the aggressive and vulgar Mrs Horrabin had arrived unheralded, baldly announcing that she intended to take over from the existing stewards. She had intimated that she knew something disreputable about Fothergill‚Äôs past, and it became clear that she wanted his job, his piece of mind, and even his body. The caretaker had a narrow escape when Mrs Horrabin‚Äôs husband called her mobile phone, but she made it clear that she would be back the next day. Lady P. reassures Fothergill that the poor takings are not his fault, and that the house‚Äôs great drawback is that nothing interesting ever happens. =\\"The Likeness\\"= Demetrius Christiaki has been trained as a painter in London. In 1880 at the age of 20 Dimi is sent by his father to paint a portrait of an elderly relative, Aunt Calliope, who lives with her great niece Evgenia in Fener, the Greek district of Stanboul. Dimi does not make much progress on the proposed painting, but is invited to meet many of Aunt Calliope‚Äôs friends at one of her soir√©es. The next day his aunt asks Dimi whether he has considered marrying Evgenia. = \\"Our Lives Are Only Lent To Us\\" = San Thom√°s de las Ollas, an old silver-mining town in Mexico, is dominated by English and American incomers whose culture is markedly different from that of the native residents. Mrs Sheridan, widow of one of the mine investors, is benevolently concerned for the family of her Mexican chauffeur, Pantale√≥n, who has been taking advantage of her to support his dependants. One of his family members is a young mixed-race woman named Esperanta, paternity uncertain, who sells fish in the local market while looking after a new baby. The market burns down, and Esperanta is killed. The Europeans and Americans donate large sums to money to build a new market, while the locals resignedly endure the catastrophe with the nostrum \\"venimos prestados\\" ‚Äì our lives are only lent to us. =\\"Desideratus\\"= On Jack Digby‚Äôs eleventh birthday his godmother gives him a keepsake, a gilt medal inscribed 'Desideratus' that had been minted on the day of his birth in 1663. He keeps the medal on him always, but one day while standing on a hill overlooking the great house nearby, he loses it. Returning the next day, he finds the medal in a puddle shining beneath thick ice. When the ice melts, the medal is washed down via a drain to the great house itself. Taking his courage in his hands, Jack enquires at the servant‚Äôs door and is called into the master‚Äôs presence. He insists that Jack accompanies him upstairs where he finds an apparently lifeless boy lying on a bed with the medal clasped in his outstretched hand. The master takes the medal and returns it to Jack. =\\"Worlds Apart\\"= Hester, whose husband has left her years earlier, lives with her six-year old daughter Tilly. She starts to develop feelings for her Polish lodger, Ernst, but is quite unable to express herself. Uncertain about Hester‚Äôs reactions, and fearful that he may accidentally have offended her, Ernst suggests moving out. Taking matters into her own hands, Tilly tells Ernst that her mother had lost her husband on 25 October, and on that day Ernst unexpectedly turns up with a bottle of wine by way of comfort and consolation. Angry that her daughter has lied, Hester shouts at him. Ernst pours the wine down the drain and leaves the house. Realising that at last she has to act, Hester chases down the street after him, catches up and asks \\"what are we going to do?\\" He replies that he is going to take her home. Background Fitzerald died in 2000, with the collection being published later the same year. The eight stories of the first edition span Fitzerald's entire career, from her first fictional publication, \\"The Axe\\" (1975), to the last published in her lifetime, \\"The Red-Haired Girl\\" (1998). Fitzgerald had originally wanted the title of the volume to be Not Shown but was overruled by her US editor. The collection was later expanded to eleven stories.For example:  Critical reception  Welcoming the book's publication in 2000, Ruth Scurr for The Times considered that each of the stories reflected the careful and distinctive hand of a true artist. She felt that the volume would win the author many new admirers. The Observer Review said that the collection showed Fitzgerald \\"at the top of her form\\". Adam Mars-Jones noted that all of Fitzgerald‚Äôs novels are miniatures, making it the more surprising that yet a further reduction of scale should result in stories that are so readable and so sharply tender. Frank Kermode for the London Review of Books praised the author's \\"wonderfully economical habit\\", and suggested that although not all these stories have the fineness and fullness of the novels, some of them do have a touch of the same quiet power to astonish. Publisher‚Äôs Weekly called the stories strange, whimsical, gothic and bizarre, demonstrating Fitzgerald's cool and civilized wit and the merciless eye she casts on worldly pretensions. Crisp, with the economical suggestiveness of poetry, each tale ends with a surprising twist. Kirkus Reviews thought that \\"everything that Fitzgerald touches here, large or small, turns quietly to gold‚Äù and that the collection will disappoint readers ‚Äúonly by the fact of its being so slender\\". Fitzgerald's 2013 biographer Hermione Lee called these 'mysterious stories' that are \\"full of Fitzgerald's unprivileged vulnerable people, making their way in the world with some bewilderment\\". Although the realities of life include cruelty, indifference, violence, and the exercise of power, the stories are also coloured with Fitzgerald's characteristic tender, funny alertness to human oddity and ordinariness. Just occasionally, she noted, in the author's luminous, dark, unflinching world, people do find ... their means of escape.

She has been politically active from Morang district. She joined active politics as a member of the CPN (ML) affiliated student union, ANNFSU. She was central deputy chair of ANNFSU at the time she graduated from student politics in 2052 BS (1995-96). She registered as a member of CPN (ML) in 2047 BS (1990-91) and was elected to the central committee of CPN (UML) by the ninth general convention in 2071 BS (2014-15). She also briefly served as the Morang district incharge of the party, before its merger with CPN-Maoist Centre in 2018. She was nominated as the ambassador of Nepal to Israel by the cabinet of KP Sharma Oli in 2016, but the government was dissolved before her nomination could be confirmed. She is considered to be a close ally of prime minister KP Sharma Oli, in addition to being particularly close to president Bidhya Devi Bhandari. She was elected to the federal parliament under the proportional representation system, nominated by the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) (CPN UML), and elected as deputy speaker with the support of her party CPN (UML), as well as the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre) (CPN MC) of the left alliance, defeating Pushpa Bhusal of Nepali Congress, on 15 March 2018 by a margin of 143 votes. Her election as deputy speaker was controversial due to the fact that the constitution prohibits having both speaker and deputy speaker from the same party, which has been the case since the merger of CPN (UML) and CPN (MC) to form the NCP. Following her election as deputy speaker, she resigned as a member of her party as per the constitutional requirement. She was 53 years old when elected deputy speaker. She resigned as the deputy speaker on 20 January 2020, and on 17 February 2020 was appointed as the Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs. She is the younger sister of NCP leader Bijay Subba, who is also a central committee member of the party and a member of the House of Representatives through proportional representation system. Subba is said to have been inspired to pursue his own doctorate (in \\"the political movement of indigenous peoples\\") from the example of Tumbahamphe. While Subba had once defected from the party and started his own party, Tumbahamphe has been a life-long member of the CPN (UML). Tumbahamphe famously challenged Bhim Acharya to a trainer dual once, after Acharya reportedly suggested a need to bring in trainers from the capital to educate party cadres in her district.

Early life and education  Watkins was educated at the University of Cambridge where she studied the Natural Sciences Tripos as a student of Christ's College, Cambridge.Kate Watkin's She completed postgraduate research and study in neuropsychology at the UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health. For her PhD in neuropsychology she used structural image analysis to study the KE family, who have a severe motor speech disorder and a mutation in the FOXP2 gene. She worked with Faraneh Vargha-Khadem and . Career and research Watkins was a postdoctoral researcher with Tomas Paus in the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital. Here she used Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), a method of stimulating the brain, in combination with electromyography (EMG) recordings of the lip and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to identify the role of the motor cortex in speech perception. She also worked alongside Brenda Milner. Watkins was appointed to the University of Oxford Functional MRI of the Brain (RMRIB) centre in 2003. She began to lecture experimental psychology at St Anne's College, Oxford in 2006. Watkins established the University of Oxford speech and brain research group, which uses neuroimaging and neurostimulation to monitor the sensorimotor interactions required for speech. Watkins uses cognitive neuroscience to investigate speech and language development. She is particularly interested in people who have stuttering, developmental verbal dyspraxia and aphasia. She has demonstrated that there are small differences in the brain activity of people who do and don't stutter, with more activity in the right hemisphere. She completed a randomized controlled trial that demonstrated that transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) can be used to enhance fluency in people who stutter. tDCS involves passing a small current through the brain, and could be used in combination with speech training to make more permanent improvements to fluency. It increases the firing rate of neurons in brain regions that Watkins has identified as important in speech disorder. She combines magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) to measure brain activity as well as the activity from the muscles responsible for producing speech. = Selected publications = Her publications include: * Tract-based spatial statistics: Voxelwise analysis of multi-subject diffusion data * Correspondence of the brain's functional architecture during activation and rest * Differential Effects of Early Hippocampal Pathology on Episodic and Semantic Memory * Seeing and hearing speech excites the motor system involved in speech production Watkins serves as the editor-in-chief of the open access journal Neurobiology of Language.

Early life Vowell was born in Oklahoma but was raised in the small Texas Panhandle community of Mobeetie. He graduated from Mobeetie High School in 1965. He then attended Southwestern Oklahoma State University in Weatherford, Oklahoma, graduating with a bachelor's degree in 1969 and a master's degree in 1978. While at Southwestern Oklahoma State, he was a member of the Bulldogs track team and also was on the dean's list. Coaching career =Early coaching= After graduating, Vowell coached at several high schools in Texas.

During World War II it changed roles and specialised in bridgebuilding and rafting to help 21st Army Group cross the numerous water obstacles encountered during the campaign in North West Europe. It continued in the post-war TA until 1967. Origin The unit was formed as part of the Royal Engineers (RE) in November 1932, when Commander V.M. Cooper, DSO, Royal Navy (retired), was commissioned as Major and Officer Commanding.Monthly Army List, various dates. It consisted of No 1 (Electric Light and Works) Company at Portman Road, Ipswich, tasked with operating electrical generators and searchlights (S/Ls) at Landguard Fort and Beacon Hill, Dovercourt, defending the ports of Harwich and Felixstowe.CQMS Donald Skeates at BBC WW2 People's War. World War II =Mobilisation= The unit mobilised on 24 August1939, shortly before the outbreak of war, and its first tasks were to establish Links Battery in holiday bungalows at Gorleston and to collect searchlights from the railway station and install them in the batteries.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 187. =584 (Suffolk) Army Field Company= In May 1940 it was decided to transfer responsibility for S/L provision to the Royal Artillery (RA) and a few of the Suffolk Fortress Engineers transferred to the RA. The rest of the unit became 584 (Suffolk) Army Field Company, RE, at Milton Barracks, Gravesend. By September it had joined companies from the Kent Fortress Royal Engineers to form Kent Corps Troops Royal Engineers (CTRE), later III (Kent) CTRE.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 120‚Äì1, 130, 133, 171. The new unit moved to Northern Ireland for training. Detachments of the Kent Fortress Engineers had already been used to destroy oil installations on the Continent during the Dunkirk evacuation to deny them to the advancing Germans; now 584 Fd Co trained for raids on enemy-held territory in Italy, but these operations were cancelled. Instead, the unit developed techniques for rafting tanks across rivers.Ford, pp. 35‚Äì7.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol VIII, pp. 76‚Äì80. III (Kent) CTRE returned to England in July 1942 and became 1st (Kent) GHQ Troops RE, assigned to First Army. However, it did not accompany First Army to North Africa in Operation Torch. Normandy In the spring of 1943 the Kent CTRE was redesignated 15th (Kent) GHQ Troops RE and reassigned to 21st Army Group for the planned invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord). It trained in building heavy bridges, and also in assembling Naval Pontoon Causeways to provide firm roads over soft beaches and to provide 'dryshod' landings for disembarking vehicles. Although delayed by storms, the sappers had some of these causeways operating by 11 June 1944 (five days after D Day) and steady steam of vehicles and stores was coming ashore.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, p. 368. Vernon Bridge Bridges laid at Vernon, 28 August 1944 After 21st Army Group broke out from the Normandy beachhead, 15th (Kent) GHQTRE was assigned to 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division for the assault crossing of the River Seine at Vernon. While the Kent companies took part in the infantry assault that established a bridgehead on 25 August, the rest of the unit with the heavy equipment was held up on the road away. The vital one and half platoons of 584 (Suffolk) Fd Co with the tank rafting material did not arrive at the river's edge until 21.00 on 26 August and struggled to get a tank ferry into operation before morning on the 27th. Once the bridgehead was secure, the Kent REs' next task in this complex operation was to build a 223-metre Bailey bridge, codenamed 'Saul', in 36 hours. When 15th (Kent) GHQTRE and other bridging units had completed their tasks, 43rd Division and its supporting armour crossed in strength on 28 August and began 21st Army Group's rapid advance to Brussels.Ellis, Normandy, pp. 452‚Äì3, 466.Essame, pp. 98‚Äì110.Ford, pp. 109‚Äì10, 123, 129, 171.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, pp. 379‚Äì83. Nijmegen After the failure of Operation Market Garden, the vital road and rail bridges that had been captured at Nijmegen were damaged by German swimmers who attached mines to the piers. A hole was blown in the roadway of the road bridge, but was swiftly repaired by the insertion of two Bailey spans by 15th (Kent) GHQTRE and XXX CTRE; the bridges were also camouflaged.Morling, pp. 191, 202.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, p. 408. Operation Plunder Men of 15th Scottish Division crossing the Rhine by stormboat on 24 March 1945. Early in 1945, in order to improve the lines of communication for the planned assault crossing of the Rhine (Operation Plunder), additional bridges were constructed over the Maas at Venlo. 15th (Kent) GHQTRE was responsible for a 1220-foot (370 m) all-weather Class 40 Bailey pontoon bridge.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, p. 475. The unit was then assigned to XII Corps for Operation Plunder itself, controlling all engineering work for the assault crossing by 44th (Lowland) Brigade of 15th (Scottish) Division near Xanten on the night of 23/24 March 1945 (Operation Torchlight).Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, pp. 484. The first wave of infantry crossed at 02.00 aboard Buffalo tracked landing vehicles; once it was known that this crossing had been successful, the Kent RE field companies manned stormboats to ferry infantry across. At 03.30, rafting equipment was moved down to the river bank on sledges and by 06.30 the unit had two of these in operation (two others were destroyed by shellfire before they could be completed and had to be replaced later from reserves). The RE History records that the rafting troops received an unsolicited testimonial for their watermanship from a captured German officer who was being ferried back.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, pp. 486‚Äì7.Martin, pp. 275‚Äì83.Saunders, pp. 149‚Äì59. Afterwards, 584 (Suffolk) Fd Co assisted in building 'Sparrow' bridge across the Rhine at Xanten, named after Sapper Sparrow who was drowned during its construction.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, p 502. Bremen After Bremen had been captured on 27 April, 15th (Kent) GHQTRE built a barge bridge with Bailey superstructure to link the two halves of the city.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, pp. 514‚Äì5. All German forces facing 21st Army Group surrendered at L√ºneburg Heath on 4 May, but there were many months of bridgebuilding and reconstruction work before the troops could be demobilised. 584 (Suffolk) Fd Co was moved from Bremen to M√ºnster to clear destroyed railway bridges from the Dortmund‚ÄìEms Canal so that food supply routes could be opened up for the German civilians.Pakenham-Walsh, Vol IX, pp. 545‚Äì51. 15th (Kent) GHQTRE and its companies were disbanded on 10 June 1946. Postwar When the TA was reconstituted in 1947, the Suffolk RE unit was reformed at Ipswich as the independent 584 Field Squadron, RE. In 1961 it was redesignated 251 Field Park Squadron, RE, and assigned to 54th (East Anglian) Division/District. When the TA was reduced into the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve (TAVR) in 1967 the squadron was disbanded, with 54th Division/District RE forming a cadre within the Essex Yeomanry.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 290, 302, 306.576‚Äì873 Sqns RE at British Army 1945 on.226‚Äì255 Sqns RE at British Army 1945 on.

The oldest reference to this church dates from 1001. The church was declared a Monumento nacional in 1931, and it is one of the most important and best preserved Romanesque churches of the Valley of Mena, despite the 19th-century restorations that altered its original scheme and replaced some of its sculptures with new statuary.Fundaci√≥n Santa Mar√≠a la Real, Enciclopedia del Rom√°nico en la Pen√≠nsula Ib√©rica, Burgos - pp 2001-2003 The building The building plan follows the standard Romanesque style, with a single rounded apse on the eastern side. The layout is basilical, with two small chapels on both sides of the main nave. There are two entrances to the church, one on the western fa√ßade and a second one on the south fa√ßade.  The interior  The church's interior is richly decorated with sculpture that, although unrefined, is highly expressive. In the southern chapel is a relief representing Santa Juliana pulling the hair of a kneeling devil. The capitals show a variety of motifs, mostly demons and fantastic animals. A hanging corbel is decorated with the charming head of a character that looks out over the border. The northern chapel has a capital with a scene of fighting knights of good quality making.

Retrieved August 3, 2019. It consists of demo recordings made in 1983 prior to their self-titled debut release in 1985 and was recorded by the original Lone Justice lineup consisting of Maria McKee, Ryan Hedgecock, Dave Harrington and Don Willens. All tracks are previously unissued, except \\"Drugstore Cowboy\\" which was included on the compilation album This World Is Not My Home in 1999. David Mansfield, who has toured with Bob Dylan and later became a member of Bruce Hornsby and the Range, guests on pedal steel guitar and fiddle. Background Musician Marvin Etzioni had met Maria McKee and Ryan Hedgecock in 1982, when he saw them perform as a duo at the Cathay de Grande night club in Los Angeles, playing half a dozen country covers. He was impressed by their performance and suggested that they start writing their own songs. McKee and Hedgecock soon added bassist Dave Harrington and drummer Don Willens to the lineup and became Lone Justice. Etzioni: \\"Once they added a rhythm section, Ryan called and asked me to come by rehearsals. I was then brought in as producer, arranger and songster.\\" Etzioni wrote \\"Working Late\\" and \\"I See It\\" specifically for the band. Through their live performances, the band garnered interest from Geffen Records, who offered to finance a demo recording. The band then recorded five songs in May 1983 at the Record Plant in Los Angeles with Etzioni producing. Geffen liked the demo tape but worried about the band being \\"too country\\", especially for a label that didn't have any experience with country music. This caused Geffen to pass on Lone Justice for the time being. The Record Plant recordings make up five of the six tracks on The Western Tapes, 1983, while an earlier session produced by Hedgecock and recorded at Mystic Sound in Los Angeles provides the sixth track. Three of the songs (\\"Working Late\\", \\"Don't Toss Us Away\\" and \\"The Train\\") would be rerecorded during sessions for the band's debut album Lone Justice, released by Geffen in 1985. Critical reception Coachella Valley Weekly wrote, \\"Listening to this music 35 years on, the songs are imbued with a passion and authenticity that somehow eluded their Geffen debut. ... imagine how great their first full-length could have been with Marvin Etzioni behind the boards. He captures the raw exuberance that made Lone Justice so special.\\" AllMusic wrote that the band has \\"an energy and freshness that are absolutely winning\\" and also praised Marvin Etzionis production for its \\"straightforward but full- bodied\\" sound, and for bringing out \\"solid performances\\" from everyone involved. They felt that Maria McKee's voice \\"is still a thing of wonder all these years later, a pure country instrument that still has the force to sing thoroughly convincing rock & roll.\\" AllMusic added: \\"One can't help wish some smart indie label had cut a low-budget album on this band ... that would have documented their heyday before Geffen got ahold of them.\\" They concluded, saying: \\"this is great fun from a band that had a lot to offer - more than their best-known work might suggest.\\" Country Standard Time wrote, \\"There's a freshness and innocence about these six recordings that will remind you just how special Lone Justice was at their inception\\", adding that \\"Lone Justice was alt.-country long before alt.-country was cool\\". All About Jazz singled out \\"Working Late\\" and \\"Don't Toss Us Away\\", describing them as \\"superior to subsequent studio versions\\". They felt that the EP was mastered \\"to impressive effect ... forging a sonic clarity in line with the pioneering stylistic vision of Lone Justice.\\" Track listing Adapted from the EP's liner notes.

His diary of his service with the 12th Royal Scots Regiment of the British Army at Passchendaele and the Somme during the First World War was published in 1928. A scholar of Italian literature and Carnegie research fellow at the University of Glasgow, he later entered the electricity industry where he became a senior economist and statistician and advocated the greater use of Scottish hydro-electric power distributed through the newly constructed National Grid. He wrote on German history, the electricity industry, the advantages of central planning in housing and industry, and on topographical subjects such as the two books he produced on his native Scotland. He was closely associated with the British Labour Party and a member of the influential XYZ Club that fed financial intelligence to the party in the 1930s. Early life and family Hugh Quigley was born in Stirling, Scotland, on 6 August 1895, the eldest son of James and Catherine Quigley. He was educated at Lanark Grammar School and then the University of Glasgow. He also studied in Naples and Munich. He served in the 12th Royal Scots Regiment of the British Army during the First World War and was at Passchendaele and the Somme where he was injured.

Career Quigley worked as an economist in the research department of the Metropolitan-Vickers Electrical Company from 1922 to 1924 and was head of the economic and statistical department of the British Electrotechnical and Allied Manufacturers' Association from 1924 to 1930.

He was involved in the production of Paul Rotha's documentary film The Face of Britain (1935) which was sponsored (uncredited) by the Central Electricity Board. He saw the potential for power from Scottish hydro-electrical sources, distributed by the newly built National Grid (1928‚Äì33), to play a major role in the reorganisation of British industry that was also one of the themes of Rotha's film.Face of Britain, The (1935). Jez Stewart, BFI screenonline. Retrieved 7 August 2019. Politics Quigley was associated with the Labour Party and an advocate generally of central planning and government intervention, arguing in respect of housing for instance that the planned city was a \\"necessity of the modern world; it takes the place of an economic scheme based on laissez-faire, which has been unequal to the task of maintaining the population, absorbing its natural increase and creating a higher standard of living\\". He was a member of the XYZ Club, formed in 1932, which met in secret at first and existed to provide financial intelligence to the Labour Party. It drew up plans for the nationalisation of the Bank of England, and these were put into practice in 1946 when a Labour government came to power immediately after the end of the Second World War. Writing In 1927 he published Towards Industrial Recovery, a survey of post-First World War industrial conditions and organisation in Britain, France and Germany. Barbara Wootton, in reviewing the work, summarised Quigley's recommendations for more competitive industry as \\"closer horizontal combination by the formation of trusts or central selling and purchasing agencies, closer association of finance and industry and the establishment of a council like the German Reichswirtschaftsrat.\\"\\"Review: Towards Industrial Recovery\\", Barbara Wootton, The Economic Journal, Vol. 37, No. 148 (Dec., 1927), pp. 649-651.

Angell &c.;\\", Hugh Quigley, Journal of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, Vol. 9, No. 2 (March 1930), pp. 266-268. In 1934 he wrote, with Ismay Goldie, on Housing and Slum Clearance in London, comparing the developments of the London County Council at Kennington and Stamford Hill, the Duchy of Cornwall's building at Kennington, the development at Somers Town by the St Pancras House Improvement Society, and others favourably with the new schemes built in Austria, Germany and the Netherlands. The authors concluded that piecemeal slum clearance by private developers was insufficient and that more comprehensive development should begin while \\"cheap money, cheap material, and idle labour are procurable.\\"\\"Housing in London\\", The British Medical Journal, Vol. 2, No. 3840 (Aug. 11, 1934), p. 257. via Jstor. His topographical works included a study of Lombardy, the Tyrol and the Trentino (1925), a book about the Rh√¥ne (1927), and two on his native Scotland: an anthology of Lanarkshire (1929) and a volume on the Scottish Highlands in Batsford's The Face of Britain series (1936). In that book, despite mainly covering the natural environment, Quigley returned regularly to the contribution that electrification could make to national prosperity, advocating, for instance, the electrification of Highland railways using hydro-electric power.Quigley, H.

Named for Samuel Johnson's 18th- century historical essay series The Idler, the magazine published primarily non-fiction essays as well as some poetry and fiction.

Toronto Star, October 31, 1992. History The magazine was launched by David Warren, a freelance journalist and editor, in January 1985, and was run by Warren as founding editor and Gerald Owen as managing editor. Funded entirely by Warren's own savings, the first issue was almost entirely given away as free promotional copies in an effort to gain notice and build a subscription list for future issues. It was only modestly successful in attracting subscribers, and suspended publication after the sixth issue; in 1986, Toronto businessman Manny Drukier stepped in to salvage the magazine.\\"There's room at the inn for The Idler\\". Toronto Star, May 10, 1986. Drukier also spearheaded the conversion of the magazine's offices into a pub which would serve as a literary salon where customers could engage in intellectual conversation, attend literary readings, and help to fund the magazine through alcohol and food sales.\\"'Angel' gets Idler hands busy again\\". The Globe and Mail, June 25, 1986. Although initially founded on the principle that it would not seek government publishing grants, it applied for grants from the Canada Council and the Ontario Arts Council in 1987.Barbara Amiel, \\"Literary magazine deserves our tax dollars\\". Windsor Star, December 9, 1987. Its applications that year were declined by both organizations, with statements that the juries felt the publication substandard ‚Äì though the same week, the University of Ottawa made a request to reprint a half-dozen Idler articles as \\"examples of fine prose\\" in a textbook of essays and journalism. The editors and some in the mainstream press claimed that the magazine had been denied the grants because of its political outlook.Mavor Moore, \\"A bad case of politesse oblige\\". The Globe and Mail, February 20, 1988. Because the Canada Council had approved grants to 97 other magazines, The Idler then launched a subscription drive under the slogan \\"Subscribe to the 98th Best Literary Magazine in Canada\\".David Warren, \\"Of a pub and publishing: As the Idler Pub closes its doors, the founder of the Idler magazine looks back on the publication's early years\\". National Post, September 30, 2002. In 1989, Warren left the magazine to become a political columnist for the Kingston Whig-Standard, and Owen was joined by new partners Paul Wilson and Alexander Szemberg. The new editorial team announced plans to expand the magazine from a bimonthly to a monthly. That year the magazine was successful in receiving grants from both the Ontario Arts Council\\"Grant gives Idler the breath of life\\".

The magazine was acquired by Devon Cross in 1992. Cross brought Warren back as the magazine's editor, and Owen, Wilson and Szemberg left.

Toronto Star, February 14, 1992. At this time, the magazine also received a $25,000 grant from the Smith Richardson Foundation. The magazine ceased publishing in 1993 after its grant from the Smith Richardson Foundation ran out; it was unable to convince the foundation to support the magazine for another year, on the grounds that the magazine's content was not conservative enough, and was more literary than policy- oriented. Despite the magazine's cessation, The Idler Pub remained in operation until 2002.\\"Idler poetry pub closing its doors after 15 years of readings\\". Toronto Star, September 10, 2002.

One of its sole ideological redlines was that it would not publish content that supported abortion; otherwise, the magazine was willing to print any writing, whether progressive or conservative or apolitical, that was written from an intellectual perspective and not beholden to what Warren perceived as Establishment values. According to columnist Barbara Amiel, \\"while it is inaccurate to describe it as a right-wing publication, it is perhaps accurate to say it has a right-wing cultural sensibility ‚Äì insofar as it values excellence and elite cultural standards\\"; according to Warren himself, \\"we struck the pose of 18th-century gentlemen and gentlewomen, and used sentences that had subordinate clauses. We reviewed heavy books, devoted long articles to subjects such as birdwatching in Kenya or the anthropic cosmological principle, and we printed mottoes in Latin or German without translating them. This left our natural ideological adversaries scratching their heads.\\" Most frequently compared to The New Yorker, the magazine was deliberately archaic in its design. It was printed on heavy stock book paper rather than glossy magazine or newspaper stock,\\"The Idler is well worth your time\\". Ottawa Citizen, December 15, 1991. and typeset in Baskerville. It included some cartoons similar to those in The New Yorker, but was otherwise illustrated with woodcut prints and lithographs rather than photographs. One of the magazine's most famous features was its \\"Amours & Companions\\" column, a personals column for readers looking for love which was renowned for the quirkiness of many of the ads.\\"Bluestocking seeks welder and other Idler pursuits\\". The Globe and Mail, November 29, 1988. The first appearance of \\"Amours & Companions\\" consisted entirely of fake ads written by the staff to demonstrate the desired tone for real submissions in subsequent issues. Contributors to the magazine included Scott Symons, Michael Coren, Malcolm Muggeridge, Josef Skvorecky, Jane Jacobs, George Grant, Andrew Coyne, Neil Bissoondath, Mark Kingwell, Patricia Pearson, David Frum, Kildare Dobbs, Russell Smith and Danielle Crittenden.

Besides residential homes and shops, including a supermarket, there are restaurants and cafes. History The Anjeliersgracht was dug in the first half of the 17th century as part of the city's expansion program. The canal was dug in 1650; it was filled in in 1861 (the water quality was poor, and there was a need to create room for traffic), and was called Westerstraat. Between 1922 and 1932 streetcar 20 ran from the Marnixstraat through the Westerstraat to its terminus on the Noordermarkt. There have been plans to open up some of the canals again, but citizens and businesses protested.  Market There is a market every Monday morning.  Alleys Many streets in the Jordaan had alleys between the houses; some of these were covered by other buildings in the course of time.

The deal involved the airing of a Thursday night Game of the Week in markets at least 50 miles (80 km) from a major league park. The deal earned Major League Baseball less than $500,000, but led to a new two-year contract for 40-45 games per season. Year-by-year breakdown =1980= ABC's contract was further modified prior to the season, with the network airing just five Monday Night Baseball telecasts in June of that year, followed by Sunday Afternoon Baseball in August and September. ABC did Sunday afternoon games late in the season in order to fulfill the number of games in the contract and to not interfere with Monday Night Football. From 1980 to 1981, Jim Woods and Nelson Briles (replacing Bud Harrelson) broadcast the early games on USA, while Monte Moore and Wes Parker (replacing Maury Wills) called the late game. Also in 1980, ABC (with Al Michaels and Bob Uecker on the call) broadcast the National League West tie-breaker game between the Houston Astros and Los Angeles Dodgers. On October 11, 1980, Keith Jackson called an Oklahoma-Texas college football game for ABC in the afternoon, then flew to Houston to call Game 4 of the NLCS). In the meantime, Don Drysdale filled-in for Jackson on play-by-play for the early innings (up until the middle of the fourth inning). Meanwhile, ABC used Steve Zabriskie as a field reporter during the 1980 NLCS. The 1980 World Series is tied with the 1978 Series for having the highest overall television ratings for a World Series to date, with the six games averaging a Nielsen rating of 32.8 and a share of 56. Although Bryant Gumbel anchored NBC's pregame coverage for Game 5 of the 1980 World Series, he was not present at Royals Stadium in Kansas City. Game 5 was scheduled on a Sunday, which conflicted with Gumbel's hosting duties for the network's NFL pre-game show NFL '80. As a result, Gumbel had to anchor the World Series coverage from the NBC Studios in New York City. Gumbel, however, would be present at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia for Game 6, which turned out to be the clincher for the Phillies. =1981= In , ABC planned to increase coverage to 10 Monday night games and eight Sunday afternoon games, but the players' strike that year ended up reducing the network's schedule to three Monday night and seven Sunday afternoon telecasts. Also in , as means to recoup revenue lost during a players' strike, Major League Baseball set up a special additional playoff round (as a prelude to the League Championship Series). ABC televised the American League Division Series while NBC televised the National League Division Series. The Division Series round wasn't officially instituted until 14 years later. Games 3 of the Brewers/Yankees series and Royals/Athletics series were aired regionally. On October 10, Keith Jackson called an Oklahoma-Texas college football game for ABC and missed Game 4 of the Milwaukee-New York series. In Jackson's absence, Don Drysdale filled- in for him on play-by-play alongside Howard Cosell. On a trivial note the ABC's affiliates, WTEN in Albany, New York and its satellite WCDC-TV in Adams, Massachusetts, as well as WIXT (now WSYR-TV) in Syracuse, New York, did not carry any of ABC's games at that time because of the New York Yankees games that were simulcasted from New York City's WPIX, movies, and syndicated series and specials among others in order to provide advertising for those extra money. During the 1981 players' strike, NBC used its Saturday Game of the Week time-slot to show a 20-minute strike update, followed by a sports anthology series hosted by Caitlyn Jenner (then Bruce)Jenner changed her name due to gender transition in 2015. called NBC Sports: The Summer Season. Even though Dick Enberg did play-by-play for the 1981 NLCS for NBC (working alongside Tom Seaver), Merle Harmon was, for the most part, NBC's backup baseball play-by- play announcer (serving behind Joe Garagiola, who called that year's ALCS for NBC with Tony Kubek) in 1981. Harmon's broadcast partner during this period was Ron Luciano. In late 1979, Harmon left the Milwaukee Brewers completely in favor of a multi-year pact with NBC. Harmon saw the NBC deal as a perfect opportunity since according to The Milwaukee Journal he would make more money, get more exposure, and do less traveling. At NBC, Harmon did SportsWorld, the backup Game of the Week, and served as a field reporter for the 1980 World Series. Most of all, Harmon had hoped to cover the American-boycotted 1980 Summer Olympics from Moscow. After NBC pulled out of their scheduled coverage of the 1980 Summer Olympics, Harmon considered it to be \\"a great letdown.\\" To add insult to injury, NBC fired Harmon in 1982 in favor of Bob Costas. =1982= In , ABC aired 11 Monday night games and one Sunday afternoon game. Game 1 of the 1982 NLCS had to be played twice. In the first attempt (on October 6), the Atlanta Braves led against the St. Louis Cardinals 1‚Äì0 behind Phil Niekro. The game was three outs away becoming official when the umpire stopped it. When the rain did not subside, the game was canceled. Game 1 began from the start the following night in a pitching match-up of Pascual P√©rez for the Braves and longtime Cardinal starter Bob Forsch. Howard Cosell did not broadcast Game 2 of the 1982 NLCS (alongside Al Michaels and Tommy Lasorda) because of his commitment of hosting the Pittsburgh Steelers' 50th Anniversary dinner in Pittsburgh on October 9, 1982, which was broadcast live on Pittsburgh's ABC affiliate, WTAE-TV and Pittsburgh's NBC affiliate, WPXI-TV. ABC's Jim Lampley interviewed the winners in the Cardinals' clubhouse after clinching the National League pennant in Game 3. In 1982, USA's doubleheaders did not start until June 17. Prior to the doubleheaders starting, Monte Moore and Wes Parker did the individual game until then. When the doubleheaders finally began, Moore and Parker moved over to the late game for the rest of the year. Meanwhile, Eddie Doucette (replacing Jim Woods) and Nelson Bridles were assigned to call the early game. USA continued with the plan of not starting doubleheaders until June in the final year of the package in 1983. Steve Zabriskie and Al Albert filled in for Eddie Doucette in September 1982 (Steve Grad also occasionally substituted) while Albert replaced Doucette for a game or more in 1983. On June 26, 1982, before the bottom of the 9th inning of NBC's Game of the Week between Boston and Milwaukee the power went out at Fenway Park. All television equipment stopped functioning except for one camera and the intercom. Luckily, the director of the telecast was Harry Coyle, who had previously guided 36 World Series broadcasts for NBC. He told the lone cameraman, Mario, ‚ÄúWe'll show ‚Äôem what one cameraman can do!‚Äù and proceeded to direct the final inning of the game with just a single camera and zoom lens, located above home plate ‚Äî including a frantic near-comeback by the Red Sox, who before the start of the inning, was down 11‚Äì8. According to his autobiography, Oh My, Dick Enberg (then the lead play-by-play voice for The NFL on NBC) was informed by NBC that he would become the lead play-by-play voice of the Major League Baseball Game of the Week beginning with the 1982 World Series (sharing the play-by-play duties for that game with Joe Garagiola, alongside analyst Tony Kubek) and through subsequent regular seasons. Enberg wrote that on his football trips, he would read every edition of The Sporting News to make sure he was current with all the baseball news and notes. He then met with NBC executives in September 1982, who informed him that Vin Scully was in negotiations to be their lead baseball play-by-play announcer (teaming with Garagiola, while Kubek would team with Bob Costas) and would begin with the network in the spring of 1983. Therefore, rather than throw him in randomly for one World Series, Enberg wrote that he hosted the pre-game/post-game shows while the team of Joe Garagiola and Tony Kubek did the games. According to the book, Enberg was not pleased about the decision (since he loved being the California Angels' radio voice in the 1970s and was eager to return to baseball) but the fact that NBC was bringing in Scully, arguably baseball's best announcer, was understandable. Enberg added that NBC also gave him a significant pay increase as a pseudo-apology for not coming through on the promise to make him the lead baseball play-by-play announcer. Tom Seaver provided periodic commentary during the 1982 World Series, but was not in the booth. As previously mentioned, Dick Enberg and Joe Garagiola traded off play-by-play duties (just as Tony Kubek had done with Garagiola in NBC's previous World Series broadcasts) for NBC's coverage in 1982. Garagiola called the first three and last three innings. Enberg, meanwhile, hosted the pregame show and then called the middle innings. =1983= On April 7, 1983, Major League Baseball, ABC, and NBC agreed to terms of a six-year television package worth $1.2 billion. The two networks continued to alternate coverage of the playoffs (ABC in even numbered years and NBC in odd numbered years), World Series (ABC televised the World Series in odd numbered years and NBC in even numbered years), and All-Star Game (ABC televised the All-Star Game in even numbered years and NBC in odd numbered years) through the 1989 season, with each of the 26 clubs receiving $7 million per year in return. The last package gave each club $1.9 million per year. ABC contributed $575 million for regular season prime time and Sunday afternoons and NBC paid $550 million for thirty Saturday afternoon games. ABC was contracted to televise 20 prime time regular season games a year in addition to other games (the aforementioned Sunday afternoon games). But ABC didn't come close to using that many, which meant they actually paid for games they weren't showing. To give you some perspective, ABC televised six prime time games in 1984 and eight 1985. They planned to again televise eight prime time games in 1986. USA Network's coverage became a casualty of the new $1.2 billion TV contract between Major League Baseball, ABC and NBC. One of the provisions to the new deal was that local telecasts opposite network games had to be eliminated. The New York Times observed the performance of the team of Vin Scully and Joe Garagiola by saying \\"That the duo of Scully and Garagiola is very good, and often even great, is no longer in dispute.\\" A friend of Garagiola's said \\"he understood the cash\\" concerning 407% hike in Major League Baseball fees paid by NBC for the 1984‚Äì89 contract. At this point the idea was basically summarized as Vin Scully \\"being the star\\", whereas Joe Garagiola was Pegasus or NBC's junior light. When NBC inked a six-year, $550 million contract in the fall of 1982, a return on the investment, so to speak, demanded that Vin Scully be their star baseball announcer. Scully reportedly made $2 million a year during his time with NBC in the 1980s. NBC Sports head Thomas Watson said about Scully, \\"He is baseball's best announcer. Why shouldn't he be ours?\\" Dick Enberg mused \\"No room for me. 'Game' had enough for two teams a week.\\" Henry Hecht once wrote \\"NBC's Curt Gowdy, Tony Kubek, and Monte Moore sounded like college radio rejects vs. Scully.\\" Vin Scully earned approximately $2 million per year for his NBC baseball broadcasting duties. Scully also reworked his Dodgers schedule during this period, as he would broadcast only home games on the radio and road games for television. Besides calling the Saturday Game of the Week for NBC, Scully called three World Series (1984, 1986, and 1988), four National League Championship Series (1983, 1985, 1987, and 1989), and four All-Star Games (1983, 1985, 1987, and 1989). Scully also reworked his Dodgers schedule during this period, broadcasting home games on the radio, and road games for the Dodgers television network, with Fridays and Saturdays off so he could work for NBC. Scully was on hand for several key moments in baseball history: Fred Lynn hitting the first grand slam in All-Star Game history (1983); the 1984 Detroit Tigers winning the World Series (along the way, Scully called Tigers pitcher Jack Morris' no-hitter against the Chicago White Sox on April 7); Ozzie Smith's game-winning home run in Game 5 of the 1985 National League Championship Series; the New York Mets' miracle rally in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series; the 1987 All-Star Game in Oakland, which was deadlocked at 0‚Äì0 before Tim Raines broke up the scoreless tie with a triple in the top of the 13th inning; the first official night game in the history of Chicago's Wrigley Field (August 9, 1988); Kirk Gibson's game-winning home run in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series; and chatting with former President of the United States Ronald Reagan (who said to Scully, \\"I've been out of work for six months and maybe there's a future here.\\") in the booth during the 1989 All-Star Game in Anaheim as Bo Jackson hit a lead off home-run. When Tony Kubek first teamed with Bob Costas in 1983, Kubek said \\"I'm not crazy about being assigned to the backup game, but it's no big ego deal.\\" Costas said about working with Kubek \\"I think my humor loosened Tony, and his knowledge improved me.\\" The team of Costas and Kubek proved to be a formidable pair. There were even some who preferred the team of Kubek and Costas over the musings of Vin Scully and the asides of Joe Garagiola. Costas was praised by fans for both his reverence and irreverence while Kubek was praised for his technical approach and historical perspective. For the 1983 season, NBC introduced a wraparound studio show (airing for about 15 minutes) co-hosted by Bill Macatee and Mike Adamle called 30 Rock (a reference to the New York City skyscraper that housed NBC's headquarters). The show would offer sports news, highlights and feature reports from Len Berman. It would actually handle breaking news as well. NBC canceled the 30 Rock pregame show after one year. It was also used to wraparound college basketball games, golf, and NBC SportsWorld. 1983 was also the last season that the old blackout restrictions were in place. Thus, Vin Scully's first Game of the Week telecast (Montreal at Los Angeles on April 9) did not air in Los Angeles. On June 6, 1983, Al Michaels officially succeeded Keith Jackson as the lead play-by-play announcer for Monday Night Baseball. Michaels, who spent seven seasons working backup games, was apparently very miffed over ABC Sports' delay in announcing him as their top baseball announcer. Unlike Jackson, whose forte was college football, Michaels had gigs with the Cincinnati Reds and San Francisco Giants before joining ABC in 1976. TV Guide huffed about Jackson by saying \\"A football guy, on baseball!\\" Jackson was unavailable for several World Series games in and because of conflicts with his otherwise normal college football broadcasting schedule. Thus, Michaels did play-by-play for games on weekends. For NBC's coverage of the 1983 All-Star Game in Chicago, Don Sutton was in New York, periodically tracking pitches with the aid of NBC's \\"Inside Pitch\\" technology. 1983 marked the last time that local telecasts of League Championship Series games were allowed. In 1982, Major League Baseball recognized a problem with this due to the emergence of cable superstations such as WTBS in Atlanta and WGN-TV in Chicago. When TBS tried to petition for the right to do a \\"local\\" Braves broadcast of the 1982 NLCS, Major League Baseball got a Philadelphia federal court to ban them on the grounds that as a cable superstation, TBS could not have a nationwide telecast competing with ABC's. Earl Weaver was the #1 ABC analyst in , but was also employed by the Baltimore Orioles as a consultant. At the time, ABC had a policy preventing an announcer who was employed by a team from working games involving that team. So whenever the Orioles were on the primary ABC game, Weaver worked the backup game. This policy forced Weaver to resign from the Orioles' consulting position in October in order to be able to work the World Series for ABC. =1984= One of the most memorable broadcasts for the pair of Bob Costas and Tony Kubek was the \\"Sandberg Game\\" on June 23, 1984 from Chicago's Wrigley Field. In that particular game, Cubs second baseman Ryne Sandberg hit two crucial, game tying home runs off of St. Louis Cardinals closer Bruce Sutter in both the bottom of the ninth and tenth innings. The Cubs (who were at one point in the game, down 9-3) would ultimately go on to win the game in eleven innings, by the score of 12‚Äì11. Bob Costas considered the Game of the Week his dream job saying \\"You can put a personal stamp on a baseball broadcast, be a reporter, something of a historian, a storyteller, conversationalist, dispenser of opinion.\\" As champions of the National League, the San Diego Padres had home-field advantage (at the time, the NL automatically gained home-field advantage in even years of the World Series) during the 1984 World Series. However, had the Chicago Cubs won the National League Championship Series (which appeared likely after the Cubs took a 2‚Äì0 lead in the best-of- five series), the Detroit Tigers would have gained home-field advantage despite the fact the American League's Baltimore Orioles had it the season before. NBC was contractually obligated to show all mid-week series games in prime time, something that would have been impossible at Wrigley Field, since the Cubs' venerable facility lacked lights at the time (they would not install lights until four years later). Had the Cubs advanced to the Series, Detroit would have hosted Games 1, 2, 6, and 7 (on Tuesday and Wednesday nights), while the Cubs would have hosted Games 3, 4, and 5 (on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), with all three games in Chicago starting no later than 1:30 p.m. Central Time. The 1984 NLCS schedule (which had an off day after Game 3 rather than Game 2) allowed ABC to have a prime time game each weeknight even though Chicago's Wrigley Field did not have lights at the time (which remained the case until four years later). ABC used Tim McCarver as a field reporter during the 1984 NLCS. During the regular season, McCarver teamed with Don Drysdale (who teamed with Earl Weaver and Reggie Jackson for the 1984 NLCS) on backup games while Al Michaels, Jim Palmer and Earl Weaver/Howard Cosell formed ABC's number one broadcasting team. For ABC's coverage of the 1984 All-Star Game, Jim Palmer only served as a between innings analyst. Had the 1984 ALCS between the Detroit Tigers and Kansas City Royals gone the full five games (the last year that the League Championship Series was a best-of-five series), Game 5 on Sunday October 7, would have been a 1 p.m. ET time start instead of being in prime time. This would have happened because one of the presidential debates between Ronald Reagan and Walter Mondale was scheduled for that night. In return, ABC was going to broadcast the debates instead of a baseball game in prime time. Al Trautwig interviewed the Detroit Tigers from their clubhouse following their pennant clinching victory in Game 3. =1985= On Thursday, October 10, 1985, NBC didn't come on the air for Game 2 of the NLCS until 8:30 p.m. ET to avoid disrupting The Cosby Show at 8 (similarly to how the network aired the soap opera Return to Peyton Place, before Game 5 of the 1972 World Series, rather than a pre-game show). NBC would do the same thing for Thursday night games in subsequent postseasons. Dick Enberg hosted the 1985 NLCS pregame shows with Joe Morgan. It was Enberg who broke the news to most of the nation that Vince Coleman had been injured before Game 4. NBC even aired an interview with one of the few people who actually saw the incident, a Dodger batboy. Dick Enberg was also at Exhibition Stadium in Toronto for Games 1 and 7 of the 1985 ALCS on NBC. Enberg hosted the pregame show alongside Rick Dempsey (who was still active with Baltimore at the time). Meanwhile, Bill Macatee provided a report on Game 2 of the ALCS during the pregame of the NLCS opener. In 1985, ABC announced that every game of the World Series would be played under the lights for the biggest baseball audience possible. Just prior to the start of the 1985 World Series, ABC removed Howard Cosell from scheduled announcing duties as punishment for his controversial book I Never Played the Game. In Cosell's place came Tim McCarver (joining play-by-play man Michaels and fellow color commentator Jim Palmer), who was beginning his trek of being a part of numerous World Series telecasts. Reportedly, by , Cosell was considered to be difficult to work with on baseball telecasts. Apparently, Cosell and Michaels got into a fairly heated argument following the conclusion of their coverage of the 1984 American League Championship Series due to Cosell's supposed drunkenness among other problems. Rumor has it that Michaels went as far as to urged ABC executives to remove Cosell from the booth. Ultimately, Michaels went public with his problems with Cosell. Michaels claimed that \\"Howard had become a cruel, evil, vicious person.\\" =1986= By , ABC only televised 13 Monday Night Baseball games. This was a fairly sharp contrast to the 18 games to that were scheduled in . The Sporting News believed that ABC paid Major League Baseball to not make them televise the regular season. TSN added that the network only wanted the sport for October anyway. Going into , ABC had reportedly purchased 20 Monday night games but only used eight of those slots. More to the point, CBS Sports president Neal Pilson said \\"Three years ago, we believed ABC's package was overpriced by $175 million. We still believe it's overpriced by $175 million.\\" During the 1986 season, Don Drysdale did play-by-play ABC's Sunday afternoon games, which aired until July, when Monday Night Baseball began. Al Michaels did the main Sunday game usually with Jim Palmer, while Drysdale and Johnny Bench did the backup contests. Keith Jackson, usually working with Tim McCarver did the #2 Monday night games. Bench took a week off in June (with Steve Busby filling in), and also worked one game with Michaels as the networks switched the announcer pairings. While Drysdale worked the All-Star Game in Houston as an interviewer he did not resurface until the playoffs. Bench simply disappeared, ultimately going to CBS Radio. On October 15, 1986, Game 6 of the NLCS ran so long (lasting for 16 innings, 5 hours and 29 minutes), it bumped up against the start time of Game 7 of the ALCS (also on ABC). During Game 6 of the NLCS, color commentator Tim McCarver left the booth during the bottom of the 16th, in order to cover the expected celebration in the New York Mets' clubhouse. As a result, play-by-play man Keith Jackson was on the air by himself for a short time. Eventually, McCarver rejoined the broadcast just before the end of the game, watching the action on a monitor in the Mets' clubhouse, then doing the postgame interviews with the Mets. Meanwhile, Corey McPherrin, a sports anchor with WABC (ABC's flagship station out of New York) interviewed Mike Scott when he was presented with the 1986 NLCS MVP award after Game 6. During the late 1980s, McPherrin delivered in-game updates during ABC's Monday Night Baseball and Thursday Night Baseball broadcasts. In his last ever ABC assignment, Don Drysdale interviewed the winners in the Boston clubhouse following Game 7 of the 1986 ALCS. Vin Scully's call of the final play in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series on NBC television would quickly become an iconic one to baseball fans, with the normally calm Scully growing increasingly excited: \\"So the winning run is at second base, with two outs, three and two to Mookie Wilson. [A] little roller up along first... behind the bag! It gets through Buckner! Here comes Knight, and the Mets win it!\\" Scully then remained silent for more than three minutes, letting the pictures and the crowd noise tell the story. Scully resumed with \\"If one picture is worth a thousand words, you have seen about a million words, but more than that, you have seen an absolutely bizarre finish to Game 6 of the 1986 World Series. The Mets are not only alive, they are well; and they will play the Red Sox in Game 7 tomorrow!\\" Game 6 caused the first preemption of Saturday Night Live, due to extra innings. The preempted episode would air two weeks later on November 8, with an introduction by Ron Darling, who explained that when the Mets entered the locker room, they were informed that they caused the first delay in SNLs 11-year history (at the time) to their dismay. NBC's broadcast of Game 7 of the 1986 World Series (which went up against a Monday Night Football game between the Washington Redskins and New York Giants on ABC) garnered a Nielsen rating of 38.9 and a 55 share, making it the highest-rated single World Series game to date. Game 7 had been scheduled for Sunday, but a rain-out forced the game to Monday. NBC's telecast of the Series ended with the song \\"Limelight\\" from Stereotomy, penultimate album of The Alan Parsons Project. =1987= NBC used Don Sutton as a pre- and post-game analyst for their 1987 LCS coverage. Sutton also made an appearance in the booth during Game 3 of the ALCS. Sutton talked with Bob Costas and Tony Kubek about Twins pitcher Les Straker's borderline balk in that game. Sutton later interviewed Detroit Tigers manager Sparky Anderson following their loss in Game 5. Meanwhile, Marv Albert went back-and-forth during both 1987 LCS. He hosted the pregame for Game 1 of the NLCS with Joe Morgan, and in fact had to read the lineups to the viewing audience. There was a problem with the P.A. feed at Busch Memorial Stadium in St. Louis, so he ended up reading the script from the Cardinal dugout while the players were introduced to the crowd. He then went to Minneapolis the next night to host the ALCS pregame with Don Sutton at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. Jimmy Cefalo hosted the pregame coverage for Game 5 of the NLCS, as Marv Albert was away on a boxing assignment for NBC. Jay Randolph, who was also the sports director for St. Louis NBC affiliate KSDK, interviewed the winners in the St. Louis Cardinals' clubhouse following their Game 7 victory. Also following Game 7, NBC's Marv Albert interviewed 1987 NLCS MVP, Jeffrey Leonard of the San Francisco Giants (to date, the last person from the losing team to win a postseason series Most Valuable Player Award, either League Championship Series or World Series). For the 1987 World Series between the Minnesota Twins and St. Louis Cardinals, ABC utilized 12 cameras and nine tape machines. This includes cameras positioned down the left field line, on the roof of the Metrodome, and high above third base. There have been a few occasions when two Monday Night Football games were played simultaneously. In 1987, a scheduling conflict arose when Major League Baseball's Minnesota Twins went to Game 7 of the World Series (which also aired on ABC), making the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome unavailable for the Minnesota Vikings' scheduled game (against the Denver Broncos) that Sunday. Although Al Michaels, Jim Palmer and Tim McCarver had done the 1985 and 1987 World Series together as well as the 1986 All-Star Game, ABC did not team them on a regular basis on Monday Night Baseball until (after three 'experiments' in ). =1988= Ratings for the Game of the Week had dropped from an average of 6.1 in 1984 to 5.5 in 1988 and an average of 4.8 by July 1989. According to a Major League Baseball report, an average of fewer than five million households viewed the Saturday afternoon Game of the Week in 1988. In an effort to push the ratings higher, NBC tried to feature a club from one of the major media markets. Of the 32 games it aired during 1988, only three did not feature a club from New York City, Chicago, or Los Angeles. During the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike, networks benefited from sports programming, including NBC, which relied on the Summer Olympics in September and the World Series in October, and ABC, which in addition to its postseason baseball coverage, moved up the start time for the early weeks of Monday Night Football (when Al Michaels was unavailable to do play-by-play on Monday Night Football, which he had done for ABC beginning in 1986 due to his postseason baseball duties, Frank Gifford covered for him) from 9 p.m. ET to 8 p.m. ET (MacGyver, which normally aired at 8 p.m., was not yet ready with new episodes). ABC's coverage of Game 2 of the 1988 NLCS didn't start until 10 p.m. ET due to a presidential debate. This is the latest ever scheduled start for an LCS game. Gary Bender did play-by-play for the 1988 American League Championship Series between the Oakland Athletics and Boston Red Sox. Bender spent two years (1987-1988) as the #2 baseball play-by-play man for ABC behind Al Michaels. Bender worked the backup Monday Night Baseball broadcasts (with Tim McCarver in 1987 and Joe Morgan in 1988) as well as serving as a field reporter for ABC's 1987 World Series coverage. After Bender spent an entire summer developing a team with Joe Morgan, ABC brought in Reggie Jackson to work with the duo for the 1988 ALCS. According to Bender's autobiography Call of the Game (pages 118-120), ABC's decision to bring in Jackson to work with Bender and Morgan caused problems: During the spare time of his active career, Reggie Jackson worked as a field reporter and color commentator for ABC Sports. During the 1980s (1983, 1985, and 1987 respectively), Jackson was given the task of presiding over the World Series Trophy presentations. As previously mentioned, longtime Los Angeles Dodgers' broadcaster Vin Scully called the 1988 World Series for a national television audience on NBC with Joe Garagiola. Unknown to the fans and the media at the time, Kirk Gibson was watching the game on television while undergoing physical therapy in the Dodgers' clubhouse. At some point during the game, television cameras scanned the Dodgers dugout and Scully, observed that Gibson was nowhere to be found. This spurred Gibson to tell Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda that he was available to pinch hit. Gibson immediately returned to the batting cage in the clubhouse to take practice swings. Bob Costas, who, along with Marv Albert, hosted NBC's World Series pre-game coverage and handled post-game interviews, made on-air statements that enraged many in the Dodgers' clubhouse (especially Tommy Lasorda). After the Dodgers won Game 4, Lasorda (during a post-game interview with Marv Albert) sarcastically said that the MVP of the World Series should be Bob Costas. While Kirk Gibson was taking practice swings in the Dodgers' clubhouse during Game 1, Orel Hershiser set up the hitting tee for his teammate. Along the way, Costas could hear Gibson's agonized-sounding grunts after every hit. Costas said that the 1988 Dodgers possibly had the weakest hitting line-up in World Series history. The following is Vin Scully's call of Kirk Gibson's game inning home run in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series[180] of the 1988 World Series: \\"All year long, they looked to him to light the fire, [Scully began] and all year long, he answered the demands, until he was physically unable to start tonight ‚Äì with two bad legs: The bad left hamstring, and the swollen right knee. And, with two out, you talk about a roll of the dice... this is it.\\" Scully made repeated references to Gibson's legs, noting at one point that the batter was \\"shaking his left leg, making it quiver, like a horse trying to get rid of a troublesome fly.\\" Gibson worked the count to 3‚Äì2 as Mike Davis stole second base; the camera turned at that point to Steve Sax getting ready for his turn at the plate, and Scully reminded the viewers that Sax was waiting on deck, but that the game right now is at the plate. \\"High fly ball into right field, she i-i-i-is... gone!!\\" Scully said nothing for over a minute, allowing the pictures to tell the story. Finally, he said, \\"In a year that has been so improbable... the impossible has happened!\\" Returning to the subject of Gibson's banged-up legs during a replay, Scully joked, \\"And, now, the only question was, could he make it around the base paths unassisted?!\\" \\"You know, I said it once before, a few days ago, that Kirk Gibson was not the Most Valuable Player; that the Most Valuable Player for the Dodgers was Tinkerbell. But, tonight, I think Tinkerbell backed off for Kirk Gibson. And, look at Eckersley ‚Äì shocked to his toes!\\" \\"They are going wild at Dodger Stadium ‚Äì no one wants to leave!\\" As NBC showed a replay of Gibson rounding second base in his home run trot, Scully then made a point to note Eckersley's pitching performance throughout the 1988 season, to put things in perspective. \\"Dennis Eckersley allowed five home runs all year. And we'll be back.\\" The 1988 World Series marked the last time that NBC would televise a World Series for seven years. Beginning in , NBC would be shut out of Major League Baseball coverage completely, after CBS signed a four-year, exclusive television contract. After splitting coverage of the 1995 World Series with ABC, NBC would next cover a World Series exclusively in 1997. =1989= In (the final year of ABC's contract with Major League Baseball), ABC moved the baseball telecasts to Thursday nights in hopes of getting leg up against NBC's Cosby Show. After braving the traumatic Loma Prieta earthquake and an all-time low 16.4 rating for the 1989 World Series, As previously mentioned former President of the United States, Ronald Reagan (who had just left office) served as the color commentator instead of Tom Seaver (Vin Scully's normal NBC broadcasting partner at the time) for the first inning of the 1989 All-Star Game from Anaheim. Bo Jackson became a popular figure for his athleticism in multiple sports through the late 1980s and early 1990s. He served as a spokesman for Nike and was involved in a popular ad campaign called \\"Bo Knows\\" which envisioned Jackson attempting to take up a litany of other sports, including tennis, golf, luge, auto racing, and even playing blues music with Bo Diddley, who scolded Jackson by telling him, \\"You don't know diddley!\\" (in a later version of the spot, Jackson is shown playing the guitar expertly, after which an impressed Diddley says, \\"Bo...you do know Diddley, don't you?\\") Serendipitously, the original spot first aired during the commercial break immediately following Jackson's lead- off home run in the 1989 Major League Baseball All-Star Game (as Vin Scully exclaimed, \\"Look at that one! Bo Jackson says hello!\\"). On Saturday, June 3, 1989, Vin Scully was doing the play-by-play for the NBC Game of the Week in St. Louis, where the Cardinals beat the Chicago Cubs in 10 innings. Meanwhile, the Dodgers were playing a series in Houston, where Scully flew to be on hand to call the Sunday game of the series. However, the Saturday night game between the teams was going into extra innings when Scully arrived in town, so he went to the Astrodome instead of his hotel. He picked up the play-by-play, helping to relieve the other Dodger announcers, who were doing both television and radio, and broadcast the final 13 innings (after already calling 10 innings in St. Louis), as the game went 22 innings. He broadcast 23 innings in one day in two different cities. CTV would simulcast NBC Game of the Week telecasts of Toronto Blue Jays games, such as NBC's final Game of the Week telecast on September 30, 1989, where the Blue Jays clinched the American League East against the Baltimore Orioles. Meanwhile, in the latter part of his career, National League umpire Doug Harvey became known for appearing in the \\"You Make the Call\\" segments on NBC's Game of the Week telecasts. Then Texas Rangers manager Bobby Valentine worked as an on-the-field analyst for NBC's 1989 ALCS coverage. Likewise, recently retired Philadelphia Phillies legend Mike Schmidt did the same for the NLCS. Vin Scully was unable to call Game 2 of the 1989 National League Championship Series (on Wednesday, October 4) because he was suffering from laryngitis. As a result, secondary play-by- play announcer Bob Costas filled in for him. Around the same time, Costas was assigned to call the American League Championship Series between Oakland and Toronto. Game 2 of the NLCS occurred on Thursday, October 5, which was an off day for the ALCS. NBC then decided to fly Costas from Toronto to Chicago to substitute for Scully on Thursday night. Afterwards, Costas flew back to Toronto, where he resumed work on the ALCS the next night. Jimmy Cefalo hosted the pregame show for Game 4 of the 1989 ALCS as Marv Albert was away on an NFL assignment for NBC. As previously mentioned, Game 3 of the 1989 World Series (initially scheduled for October 17) was delayed by ten days due to the Loma Prieta earthquake. The earthquake struck at approximately 5:04 p.m. Pacific Time. At the moment the quake struck, ABC's color commentator Tim McCarver was narrating taped highlights of the previous Series game. Viewers saw the video signal begin to break up, heard McCarver repeat a sentence as the shaking distracted him, and heard McCarver's colleague Al Michaels exclaim, \\"I'll tell you what, we're having an earth‚Äî.\\"\\"Earthquake\\".

Retrieved August 29, 2009. The network put up a green ABC Sports graphic as the audio was switched to a telephone link. Michaels had to pickup a POTS phone in the press booth (phones work off a separate power supply) and call ABC headquarters in New York, at which point they put him back on the air. Michaels cracked, \\"Well folks, that's the greatest open in the history of television, bar none!\\" accompanied by the excited screams of fans who had no idea of the devastation elsewhere.\\"Earthquake\\". Time. Monday, October 30, 1989. Ed Magnuson. p. 3. Retrieved September 5, 2009. After about a 15-minute delay (ABC aired a rerun of Roseanne and subsequently, The Wonder Years in the meantime), ABC was able to regain power via a backup generator. ABC's play-by- play man, Al Michaels (who was familiar with the San Francisco Bay Area dating back to his days working for the San Francisco Giants from 1974-1976) then proceeded to relay reports to Ted Koppel at ABC News' headquarters in Washington, D.C. Al Michaels was ultimately nominated for an Emmy for his on- site reporting at the World Series. The Goodyear blimp was aloft above the ballpark to provide aerial coverage of the World Series. Blimp pilot John Crayton reported that he felt four bumps during the quake. ABC was able to use the blimp to capture some of the first images of the damage to the Bay Bridge. The end of the ABC-NBC pact After calling the 1988 World Series with Vin Scully, Joe Garagiola resigned from NBC Sports. Although it was not official at the time, NBC was on the verge of losing the television rights to cover Major League Baseball to CBS. Garagiola claimed that NBC left him \\"twisting\\" while he was trying to renegotiate his deal. Joe Garagiola was replaced by Tom Seaver for the 1989 season. Al Michaels took ABC's loss of baseball to CBS as \\"tough to accept.\\"Michaels added that \\"baseball was such an early stepchild at ABC and had come such a long way.\\" Gary Thorne, who served as ABC's backup play-by-play announcer in 1989 and was an on-field reporter for the World Series that year (and covering the trophy presentation in the process), simply laughed while saying \\"Great reviews, just as ABC baseball ends.\\" Meanwhile, Dennis Swanson, president of ABC Sports, noted in a statement that baseball had been a blue-chip franchise since 1976 for the network, which was disappointed to lose it. After ABC lost the Major League Baseball package to CBS, they aggressively counterprogrammed CBS' postseason baseball coverage with made-for-TV movies and miniseries geared towards female viewers. NBC's final Major League Baseball broadcast was televised on October 9, 1989; Game 5 of the National League Championship Series between the San Francisco Giants and Chicago Cubs from Candlestick Park. Vin Scully said \\"It's a passing of a great American tradition. It is sad. I really and truly feel that. It will leave a vast window, to use a Washington word, where people will not get Major League Baseball and I think that's a tragedy. It's a staple that's gone. I feel for people who come to me and say how they miss it, and I hope me.\\" Bob Costas said that he would rather do a Game of the Week that got a 5 rating than host a Super Bowl. \\"Who thought baseball killed its best way to reach the public? It coulda kept us and CBS ‚Äì we'd have kept the 'Game' ‚Äì but it only cared about cash. Whatever else I did, I'd never have left 'Game of the Week' Costas claimed. Tony Kubek, who (as previously mentioned) teamed with Bob Costas since 1983, said \\"I can't believe it!\\" when the subject came about NBC losing baseball for the first time since 1947. Author and presidential speechwriter Curt Smith went a step further in saying that Major League Baseball's deal with CBS Sports was \\"sportscasting's Exxon Valdez.\\" Had baseball valued national promotion provided by the Game of the Week, said Smith, it never would have crafted a fast-bucks plan that has cut off the widest viewership. \\"It's an obscene imbalance\\", Smith also said, \\"to have 175 games going to 60 percent of the country [in reference to Major League Baseball's corresponding cable television deal with ESPN, which at the time was only available in about 60% of the country] and 16 games going to the rest.\\" He added: \\"Baseball has paid a grievous price for being out of sight and out of mind. It's attacked the lower and middle classes that forms baseball's heart. ... In the end, the advertising community has come to view baseball as a leper.\\" Arthur Watson, president of NBC Sports, said in a statement that NBC had \\"aggressively\\" bid to continue its 41-year involvement in baseball (NBC's bid was reportedly in the $800 million range in contrast to CBS' bid of $1.08 billion) and was \\"deeply saddened\\" when learning of CBS' deal. One possible key factor towards why NBC lost the baseball package to CBS was due to their commitment to broadcasting the 1992 Summer Olympics from Barcelona. To put things into proper perspective, two weeks prior to the announcement of the baseball deal with CBS, NBC had committed itself to paying $401 million for U.S. broadcast rights to the 1992 Summer Olympics. After the baseball deal was announced, some skeptics surmised that CBS had lowballed the Barcelona bidding so that it would have at least $1 billion to spend on baseball. According to industry insiders, neither NBC nor ABC wanted the entire baseball package‚Äîthat is, regular-season games, both League Championship Series and the World Series‚Äîbecause such a commitment would require them to preempt too many highly rated prime time shows. Thus, ABC and NBC bid thinking that two of the networks might share postseason play again or that one of the championship series might wind up on cable. Commissioner Peter Ueberroth had encouraged the cable idea, but after the bids were opened, NBC and ABC found to their chagrin that he preferred network exposure for all postseason games. Only CBS, with its weak prime time programming, dared go for that. After NBC lost the Major League Baseball package to CBS, the network aggressively counterprogrammed CBS's postseason baseball coverage with made- for-TV movies and miniseries geared towards female viewers.

Mutual may have been reindulging in dreams of becoming a television network or simply taking advantage of a long-standing business relationship; in either case, the broadcast rights were sold to NBC in time for the following season's games at an enormous profit. Year-by-year breakdown =1950= On July 11, 1950, the All-Star Game out of Chicago's Comiskey Park was televised for the first time. On November 8, 1950, Commissioner Happy Chandler and player reps agreed on the split of the TV-radio rights from the World Series. By , World Series games could be seen in most of the country, but not all. 1950 also marked the first time that there was an exclusive network television broadcaster (NBC). West Coast viewers finally saw live major league games on television during the 1951 postseason. =1951= On August 11, 1951, WCBS-TV in New York City televised the first baseball game (in which the Boston Braves beat the Brooklyn Dodgers by the score of 8‚Äì1) in color. On October 1 of that year, NBC aired the first coast-to-coast baseball telecast as the Brooklyn Dodgers were beaten by the New York Giants in the first game of a playoff series by the score of 3‚Äì1 featuring Bobby Thomson's two-run home run. Thomson's famous now-legendary home run) would occur in the third game of the best of 3 series. NBC aired the second and third games of the 1951 National League tie-breaker series between the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants, necessitated by the teams' finishing the regular season in a tie for first place. The three-game pennant playoff, which featured the first baseball games televised live from coast to coast (with CBS airing the first game), culminated on October 3 when the Giants won the third and deciding game by the score of 5‚Äì4 (off Bobby Thomson's home run). Ernie Harwell called the game for Giants television flagship WPIX ‚Äì the independent station's broadcast was simulcast nationally by NBC ‚Äì and his description of the home run was a simple shout of \\"It's gone!\\" almost at the moment Thomson's bat struck Ralph Branca's pitch. Harwell later admitted he had probably called it \\"too soon\\", but fortunately for him, the call proved to be correct. \\"And then\\", Harwell recalled, \\"the pictures took over.\\" The 1951 playoff between Brooklyn and the New York Giants and that year's World Series were the first major league baseball games telecast live from coast-to-coast to coast; transcontinental network transmission lines had been completed and activated in September, in- time for the Japanese Peace Treaty Conference in San Francisco and the start of the 1951‚Äì52 television season. =1952= The 1952 All-Star Game at Shibe Park in Philadelphia was the first nationally televised All-Star Game, but it was shortened due to rain. =1953= On January 31, 1953, the New York Yankees, Cleveland Indians and Boston Red Sox joined forces against St. Louis Browns owner Bill Veeck. The respective franchises tried to force the Browns to play afternoon games in an attempt to avoid having to share television revenues. A month later, Major League Baseball owners received a warning from Senator Edwin Johnson about nationally televising their games. Johnson's theory was that nationally televising baseball games would be a threat to the survival of minor league baseball. The owners pretty much ignored Johnson since the games on NBC in particular, were gaining a large and loyal following. In 1953, ABC-TV executive Edgar J. Scherick (who later created Wide World of Sports) broached a Saturday Game of the Week, TV sport's first network series. At the time, ABC was labeled a \\"nothing network\\" that had fewer outlets than CBS or NBC. ABC also needed paid programming or \\"anything for bills\\" as Scherick put it. At first, ABC hesitated at the idea of a nationally televised regular season baseball program. ABC wondered how exactly the Game of the Week would reach television in the first place and who would notice if it did? Also, Major League Baseball barred the Game of the Week from airing within 50 miles of any ballpark. Major League Baseball according to Scherick, insisted on protecting local coverage and didn't care about national appeal. ABC, though, did care about the national appeal and claimed that \\"most of America was still up for grabs.\\" In April 1953, Edgar Scherick set out to sell teams rights but instead, only got the Philadelphia Athletics, Cleveland Indians, and Chicago White Sox to sign on. These were not \\"national\\" broadcast contracts since they were assembled through negotiations with individual teams to telecast games from their home parks. It was until the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961, that antitrust laws barred \\"pooled rights\\" TV contracts negotiated with a central league broadcasting authority. In 1953, ABC earned an 11.4 rating for their Game of the Week telecasts. Blacked-out cities had 32% of households. In the rest of the United States, 3 in 4 TV sets in use watched Dizzy Dean and Buddy Blattner (or backup announcers Bill McColgan and Bob Finnegan) call the games for ABC. CBS took over the Saturday Game in 1955 (the rights were actually set up through the Falstaff Brewing Corporation) retaining Dean/Blattner and McColgan/Finnegan as the announcing crews (as well as Gene Kirby, who produced the Dean/Blattner games and alternated with them on play-by-play) and adding Sunday coverage in 1957. As Edgar Scherick said, \\"In '53, no one wanted us. Now teams begged for \\"Game\\"'s cash.\\" =1955= By 1955, Dizzy Dean and the Game of the Week would move from ABC to CBS (the rights were actually set up through the Falstaff Brewing Corporation). \\"CBS' stakes were higher\\" said Buddy Blattner, who left the Mutual Broadcasting System to rejoin Dean. Ron Powers wrote about the reteaming of Dean and Blattner, \\"they wanted someone who'd known Diz, could bring him out.\\" Gene Kirby, who had worked with Dean and Blattner at Mutual and ABC, produced the telecasts and also filled in on announcing duties. Bob Finnegan, who along with Bill McColgan had called backup games for ABC, performed the same role for CBS, working with a variety of color men including future Wide World of Sports host Jim McKay and future World News Tonight anchor Frank Reynolds. Another first for NBC during this period was the first color telecast of a World Series, the 1955 matchup between the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Yankees. =1956= In 1956, CBS Sports director Frank Chirkinian devised an earplug called an Intercepted Feed Back (or IFB) to connect the announcer, director, producer and thus, smoothing on-air flow. =1957= In 1957, NBC started airing weekend Game of the Week telecasts (Sunday telecasts were added in 1959) with Lindsey Nelson and Leo Durocher calling the action. During this period, NBC (as rival CBS had the rights to broadcast at least eight teams) typically broadcast from Pittsburgh's Forbes Field, Chicago's Wrigley Field or Milwaukee's County Stadium. NBC purchased the rights to 11 Milwaukee Braves games, 11 Pittsburgh Pirates games, two Washington Senators games, and two Chicago Cubs games. Leo Durocher was succeeded as color commentator by Fred Haney in 1960, and Joe Garagiola in 1961, while Bob Wolff replaced Nelson on play-by-play in 1962. Also in 1957, CBS added a Sunday Game of the Week. ABC's Edgar Scherick said \\"In '53, no one wanted us. Now teams begged for \\"Game\\"'s cash.\\" That year, the National Football League (NFL) began a US$14.1 million revenue-sharing pact. By 1965, Major League Baseball ended the large-market blackout, got $6.5 million for exclusivity, and split the pot. With CBS now carrying the Game of the Week, the network's stations in Phoenix (KOOL-TV), Little Rock (KTHV) and Cedar Rapids (KGAN-TV) were finally receiving the broadcasts. Bud Blattner said \\"America had never had TV network ball. Now you're getting two games a week [four, counting NBC, by ].\\" =1958= In 1958, Dizzy Dean ruffled the feathers of CBS Sports head Bill MacPhail when he said \\"I don't know how we come off callin' this the 'Game of the Week'. There's a much better game ‚Äì Dodgers‚ÄìGiants ‚Äì over on NBC.\\" Dean also once refused a Falstaff ad because the date was Mother's Day. When United Airlines backed CBS' Game of the Week telecasts, Dean ‚Äì who hated to fly ‚Äì said \\"If you have to, pod-nuh, Eastern is much the best.\\" That year, George Kell served as host for the pregame show. During one broadcast, Kell hoped to ask guest Casey Stengel about the Yankees' batting order. When asked about how it went, Kell said, \\"Fine. But in our 15 minutes, Casey didn't get past the leadoff batter.\\" From 1958 to 1960, NBC aired a special regional feed of its games in the southeast, where the network had a different sponsor (such as National Bohemian beer) than for the rest of the country. This feed featured its own announcing team, with Chuck Thompson calling the games with Bill Veeck (1958) and Al Rosen (1959‚Äì60). NBC never had a true backup game until 1966, when the network got exclusivity for the Game of the Week. In the process, NBC brought in Curt Gowdy and Pee Wee Reese for the primary game, and Jim Simpson and Tony Kubek for the alternate game (which was always shown in the markets of teams playing in the primary game). KTTV in Los Angeles, California aired the first regular-season baseball game ever played on the West Coast, a Los Angeles Dodgers-San Francisco Giants game from Seals Stadium in San Francisco, California, with Vin Scully announcing. In its first year airing Major League Baseball, KTTV aired only the Dodgers' road games. =1959= Jack Whitaker and Frankie Frisch announced the backup games on CBS from 1959 to 1961. They usually did games that took place in Philadelphia, New York City, Washington, D.C. or Baltimore. Whitaker once said in three years, he would only broadcast three innings because CBS would not switch away from Dizzy Dean. However, he said that he learned a lot of baseball just sitting next to Frisch. CBS had other backup crews for games featuring the Chicago Cubs and White Sox, Cleveland Indians and Cincinnati Reds. In these cases, Bob Finnegan would handle the play-by-play duties with various analysts depending on the city. CBS did not have Game of the Week rights from any other ballparks in those years. What may be the first sports instant replay using videotape occurred on July 17, 1959, during a broadcast of a New York Yankees game by New York TV station WPIX. It came after a hit by Jim McAnany of the Chicago White Sox ended a no-hitter by the Yankees' Ralph Terry. Since the game was being videotaped, broadcaster Mel Allen asked director Terry Murphy to play a tape of McAnany's hit over the air. In 1959, ABC broadcast the best-of-three playoff series (to decide the National League pennant) between the Milwaukee Braves and Los Angeles Dodgers. The cigarette company L&M; was in charge of all of the telecasts. George Kell and Bob DeLaney were the announcers. Chicago White Sox announcer Bob Elson missed a chance to call the 1959 World Series ‚Äì the White Sox' first since 1919, and Elson's first since 1943 ‚Äì on NBC because the then head of NBC Sports, Tom Gallery (who incidentally, grew up on the same block as Elson) did not like him. Elson was, however, allowed to call the Series on the White Sox' radio flagship, WCFL.

Jack Buck and Carl Erskine were the lead announcing crew for this series, which lasted one season. ABC typically did three games a week. Two of the games were always from the Eastern or Central Time Zone. The late games (no doubleheaders) were usually San Francisco Giants or Los Angeles Dodgers' home games. However, the Milwaukee Braves used to start many of their Saturday home games late in the afternoon. So if the Giants and Dodgers were both the road at the same time, ABC still would be able to show a late game. Year-by-year breakdown =1960= In 1957, NBC started airing weekend Game of the Week telecasts (Sunday telecasts were added in 1959) with Lindsey Nelson and Leo Durocher calling the action. During this period, NBC (as rival CBS had the rights to broadcast at least eight teams) typically broadcast from Pittsburgh's Forbes Field, Chicago's Wrigley Field or Milwaukee's County Stadium.

In these cases, Bob Finnegan would handle the play-by-play duties with various analysts depending on the city. CBS did not have Game of the Week rights from any other ballparks in those years. Pee Wee Reese replaced Blattner as Dean's partner in . That year, Jerry Coleman hosted the pregame show for CBS' Game of the Week broadcasts. A rather embarrassing incident for Coleman occurred when he was interviewing Cookie Lavagetto when the \\"Star- Spangled Banner\\" started. Coleman later said, \\"Believe me, when the Anthem starts, I stop, whether I'm taping, talking, or eating a banana.\\" =1961= One other note about ABC baseball coverage during this period. Despite temporarily losing the Game of the Week package in 1961, ABC still televised several games in prime time (with Jack Buck returning to call the action). This occurred as Roger Maris was poised to tie and subsequently break Babe Ruth's regular season home run record of 60. As with all Major League Baseball games in those days, the action was totally blacked out of major league markets. As a matter of fact, as documented in the HBO film 61*, the Maris family was welcomed into ABC's Kansas City, Missouri affiliate KMBC-TV so they could watch the in-house feed of the game, which was blacked out of Kansas City. =1962= In 1962, CBS dropped the Sunday baseball Game of the Week once the NFL season started, dropping the option clause for affiliates to carry baseball or football in place since 1957. =1963= In 1963 and 1964, viewers in San Francisco were unable to see certain baseball telecasts aired by CBS on KPIX-TV locally, although the games aired on stations in markets adjacent to the Bay Area. In 1963, KPIX pre-empted the July 13 game between the San Francisco Giants-Philadelphia Phillies (at 10:15 a.m.), and the Los Angeles Dodgers-Phillies game on July 14 (at 9:30 a.m.); in 1964, the station pre-empted the Kansas City Athletics-New York Yankees game on May 16 (at 10:45) and the Milwaukee Braves-St. Louis Cardinals game on May 17. All four games did air on NBC affiliate KSBW in Salinas, KXTV in Sacramento and ABC affiliate KHSL-TV in Chico (the games also aired on KOLO-TV in Reno, Nevada, however it joined the two July 1963 games in progress, at 10:25 and 9:55 a.m. on the respective dates). =1964= By , CBS' Dean and Reese called games from Yankee Stadium, Wrigley Field, St. Louis, Philadelphia and Baltimore. The New York Yankees got a $550,000 share of CBS' $895,000. Six clubs that exclusively played nationally televised games on NBC were paid $1.2 million. The theme music used on the CBS telecasts during this era was a Dixieland styled rendition of \\"Take Me Out to the Ballgame\\". On July 17, , a game out of Los Angeles between the Chicago Cubs and Los Angeles Dodgers contest became the first Pay TV baseball game. Subscription television offered the cablecast to subscribers for money. (The Dodgers beat the Cubs by the score of 3‚Äì2, with Don Drysdale collecting 10 strikeouts.) =1965= In , ABC provided the first-ever nationwide baseball coverage with weekly Saturday broadcasts on a regional basis. ABC paid $5.7 million for the rights to the 28 Saturday/holiday Games of the Week. ABC's deal covered all of the teams except the New York Yankees and Philadelphia Phillies (who had their own television deals) and called for two regionalized games on Saturdays, Independence Day, and Labor Day. Each Saturday, ABC broadcast two 2 p.m. games and one 5 p.m. game for the Pacific Time Zone. ABC blacked out the games in the home cities of the clubs playing those games. Major League Baseball however, had a TV deal with NBC for the All-Star Game and World Series. At the end of the season, ABC declined to exercise its $6.5 million option for , citing poor ratings, especially in New York. According to ABC announcer Merle Harmon's profile in Curt Smith's book Voices of Summer, in , CBS' Yankee Game of the Week beat ABC in the ratings in at least Dallas and Des Moines. To make matters worse, local television split the big-city audience. Therefore, ABC could show the Cubs vs. the Cardinals in the New York market, yet the Mets would still kill them in terms of viewership. Harmon, Chris Schenkel, Keith Jackson, and (on occasion) Ken Coleman served as ABC's principal play-by-play voices for this series. Also on the network's announcing team were pregame host Howard Cosell and color commentators Leo Durocher, Tommy Henrich, Warren Spahn (who worked with Chris Schenkel on a July 17 Baltimore-Detroit contest), and Hall of Fame Brooklyn Dodger great Jackie Robinson (who, on April 17, 1965, became the first black network broadcaster for Major League Baseball). According to ABC Sports producer Chuck Howard, \\"(Robinson) had a high, stabbing voice, great presence, and sharp mind. All he lacked was time.\\" =1966= The New York Yankees, which, the year before, had played 21 Games of the Week for CBS, joined NBC's package in 1966. The new package under NBC called for 28 games, as compared to the 123 combined among three networks during the 1960s. On October 19, 1966, NBC signed a three-year contract with Major League Baseball. As previously mentioned, the year before, Major League Baseball sold an exclusive league-wide television package for the rights to the Saturday-Sunday Game of the Week to ABC. NBC covered only the All-Star Game and World Series in 1965. In addition, a previous deal limited CBS to covering only twelve weekends when its new subsidiary, the New York Yankees, played at home. As previously mentioned, before 1965, NBC aired a slate of Saturday afternoon games beginning in 1957. Under the new deal, NBC paid roughly US$6 million per year for the 25 Games of the Week, $6.1 million for the 1967 World Series and All-Star Game, and $6.5 million for the 1968 World Series and 1968 All-Star Game. This brought the total value of the contract (which included three Monday night telecasts such as a Labor Day 1966 contest between the San Francisco Giants and Los Angeles Dodgers) up to $30.6 million. On April 16, 1966, in New York City, about 50 baseball, network, and advertising officials discussed NBC's first year with the Game of the Week. New York could not get a primary match-up between the Detroit Tigers and New York Yankees with Curt Gowdy and Pee Wee Reese calling the action because of local blackout rules. Instead, that market received a backup game (or \\"'B' game\\") featuring Tony Kubek and Jim Simpson calling a game between the Cincinnati Reds and Chicago Cubs. That rule would be eliminated after the 1983 season. In replacing CBS, NBC traded a circus for a seminar. Reese said \\"Curt Gowdy was its guy (1966‚Äì75), and didn't want Dizzy Dean ‚Äì too overpowering. Curt was nice, but worried about mistakes. Diz and I just laughed.\\" Falstaff Brewery hyped Dean as Gowdy in return said \\"I said, 'I can't do \\"Wabash Cannonball.\\" Our styles clash --\\" then came Pee Wee Reese. Gowdy added by saying about the pairing between him and Reese, \\"They figured he was fine with me, and they'd still have their boy.\\" To many, baseball meant CBS's 1955‚Äì64 Game of the Week thoroughbred. A year later, NBC bought ABC's variant of a mule so to speak. \\"We had the Series and All-Star Game. 1966‚Äì1968's Game meant exclusivity\\", said NBC Sports head Carl Lindemann, who added that \\"[Colleague] Chet Simmons and liked him [Gowdy] with the Sox and football\\" also, getting two network sports for the price of one. As his analyst, Gowdy wanted his friend Ted Williams. NBC's lead sponsor, Chrysler declined the idea when Williams, a Sears spokesman, was pictured putting stuff in a Ford truck. Before 1966, local announcers exclusively called the World Series. Typically, the Gillette Company, the Commissioner of Baseball and NBC television would choose the announcers, who would represent each of the teams that were in the World Series for the respective year. For the 1966 World Series, Curt Gowdy called half of each game before ceding the microphone to Vin Scully in Los Angeles, and Chuck Thompson in Baltimore. Scully was not satisfied with the arrangement as he said \\"What about the road? My fans won't be able to hear me.\\" In Game 1 of the 1966 World Series, Scully called the first 4¬Ω innings. When Gowdy inherited the announcing reins, Scully was so upset that he refused to say another word. As previously mentioned, before , NBC typically paired the top announcers for the respective World Series teams to alternate play-by-play during each game's telecast. For example, if the Yankees played the Dodgers in the World Series, Mel Allen (representing the Yankees) would call half the game and Vin Scully (representing the Dodgers) would call the other half of the game. However, in 1966, NBC wanted its regular network announcer, Curt Gowdy, to call most of the play-by-play at the expense of the top local announcers. So instead of calling half of every World Series game on television (as Vin Scully had done in , , , , and ) they would only get to call half of all home games on TV, providing color commentary while Gowdy called play-by-play for the remaining half of each game. The visiting teams' announcers would participate in the NBC Radio broadcasts. In broadcasts of Series-clinching (or potentially Series-clinching) games on both media, NBC would send the announcer for whichever team was ahead in the game to that team's clubhouse in the ninth inning in order to help cover the trophy presentation and conduct postgame interviews. =1967= In 1967, main Game of the Week broadcasts were blacked-out in the cities of the two participating teams. In some cases, those games were aired by way of the teams' respective local flagship stations, with their local announcing crews ‚Äì for example, the May 27, Dodgers-Giants contest in San Francisco was not carried by either KRON-TV in the originating city or KNBC in Los Angeles. The game was, however, telecast in Los Angeles over the Dodgers' flagship station KTTV, with Jerry Doggett and Vin Scully providing play-by-play. At the time, Dodgers' broadcasts over KTTV were limited to road games in San Francisco. Conversely the Giants' broadcast partner, KTVU, did not broadcast the team's home games in 1967. Viewers in the San Francisco Bay Area may have been able to view this game on one of two NBC affiliates from nearby areas, KSBW-TV in Salinas and KCRA-TV in Sacramento, California. =1968= The June 8, 1968 Game of the Week broadcast was cancelled due to coverage of the funeral/burial of Robert F. Kennedy. Cleveland at Detroit and Atlanta at Chicago Cubs were the games scheduled to air on that date. Both games were canceled as well, due to Kennedy assassination. Tony Kubek initially had trouble adjusting to the world of broadcasting. Although he had a lot to say, he was gangling, he tended to stutter, and he talked too fast. Curt Gowdy soon suggested to Kubek that he should work in the off-season to improve his delivery. Kubek bought a tape recorder and took to reading poetry aloud for 20 minutes a day. In 1968, Kubek wowed as a World Series field reporter. Pee Wee Reese, who was soon fired by NBC (and replaced by Kubek as the top analyst) said of Kubek \\"He wormed his way around, but I wasn't bitter. I just think if you don't have anything to say, you should shut your mouth.\\" =1969= In the early years of the League Championship Series, NBC typically televised a doubleheader on the opening Saturday, followed by a single game on Sunday (because of NFL coverage). They then covered the weekday games with a 1.5 hour overlap, joining the second game in progress when the first one ended. NBC usually swapped announcer crews after Game 2. From to , the Major League Baseball television contract allowed a local TV station in the market of each competing team to also carry the LCS games. So in 1969, for example, Mets fans in New York could choose to watch either the NBC telecast or Lindsey Nelson, Bob Murphy and Ralph Kiner on WOR- TV. Games 3, 4, and 5 of the 1969 World Series are believed to be the oldest surviving color television broadcasts of World Series games (even though World Series telecasts have aired in color since ). However, they were \\"truck feeds\\" in that they do not contain the original commercials, but show a static image of the Shea Stadium field between innings.

It is located about half a mile north of Aberllefenni in Gwynedd, north Wales, on the eastern side of the isolated Cwm Ceiswyn. It worked the Narrow Vein. History = Early years = Cymerau was started around 1860, following the success of the earlier Ratgoed quarry to the north. Slate was extracted from five underground chambers which were below the water table and were pumped using a waterwheel. In 1864 the Ratgoed Tramway opened, a gauge horse-worked tramway connecting the Ratgoed and Cymerau quarries with the newly opened Corris Railway at Aberllefenni. This prompted significant expansion work at the quarry. In 1878, the quarry was owned by H. R. Hughes and his nephew. = Second quarry = A second quarry was opened around 1880 between the original Cymerau workings and Ratgoed. This was a series of surface pits, connected to the Ratgoed Tramway by an incline. Slate was taken down to the mill at the southern site for processing. Cymerau had several private wagons which it used to haul slate along the Ratgoed Tramway and on down the Corris Railway to Machynlleth. At its peak the quarry employed over 100 men. = The First World War to closure = Cymerau and Ratgoed were worked as a single operation immediately before the First World War. Both quarries closed down during the First World War. Cymerau re-opened on a smaller scale after the conflict, owned by the Inigo Jones company of Groeslon. In 1921 it produced just three tons of finished slab, and employed only three men. Fortunes improved modestly during the 1920, reaching a peak employment of 14 men in 1927. Slab from the quarry was roughly shaped and planed in the Cymerau Mill, before being shipped out by the Ratgoed Tramway to Aberllefenni, then the Corris Railway to Machynlleth, before being transferred to the main line and shipped to Groeslon for finishing and enamelling. Cymerau continued its limited production during the 1930s. By the outbreak of the Second World War the quarry was down to just 6 men employed. It continued to produce through the war years, but finally closed in October 1946.
