It debuted on ITV1, and ran in reruns on ITV2 for two seasons. The series was first broadcast on 18 July 2002 and ran for twenty one-hour editions.  Format  The show would open with a monologue by the two hosts, usually loosely referencing what the contestants were to do, followed by a really quick montage of the following dares to come. Contestants were picked off the street at random, and most of the time, not even told what dare they were going to do prior, but what cash amount they were to receive. The show also usually had a big challenge where 1,000 GBP was up for grabs. These were usually accumulative three part challenges with each one getting worse. Money wasn't received for these until the last one was completed. The show is usually done in a leave-off format, in that the contestants tend to be already rounded up, skipping the process of finding them in the street more often than not. Transitions are coupled by quick montages.  Recurring Dares  Although Wudja Cudja has its share of variations, episodes tended to contain much nudity, branding it an adult program overall. Some of the recurring games were: *Rip and Strip Two [not always] female contestants would compete in a contest to see who could rip their clothes off the fastest. The women weren't allowed to use any zippers, or buttons, and had to strip down to just their panties. This was a common game and the contestants were always caught off guard and picked randomly off the street. *Bikini Tug-O-War Another female specific game in which contestants would have each other's bikinis put together, and pull against each other to see whose ripped off.  Varied Dares  Aside from the usual strip games, Wudja Cudja's other dares were similar to that of its American counterpart, I Bet You Will, with contestants either: * Eating something disgusting. * Getting their head shaved. * Being covered in something messy, and or publicly humiliated. * Something involving endurance, such as how many clothes pins can one put on their face, or how long can one hold sawdust in her bikini bottoms without scratching.

In 1914, during the early phase of World War I, he commanded the 4th Bavarian Infantry Division but retired the following year to devote himself to careful study of the matters relating to the outbreak of the war and responsibility for it.

He was married to Countess Pauline von Wimpffen. He was a German count and the official spokesman for the German Weimar Republic at the Paris Peace Conference following World War I to investigate the question of responsibility for the war. He helped to draft the German answer to the charges of war guilt and was one of the four signatories to the Memorandum, presented in May 1919, in reply to the Western Allies. Later, in the absence of the other members of the German Commission, he was jointly responsible, with Delbruck, for a further Memorandum replying to the Allied Note of 16 June.Vesey, Constance, 1925, p.5-6.

The name \\"Shasta\\" refers to both a live and an anthropomorphic costumed cougar mascot. History The origin of Shasta dates back to 1927 when John R. Bender, a former head football coach of the Washington State Cougars came to Houston. Because of his fondness for the animal, Bender decided it would be the name of his new teams. Later that year, the school newspaper actively used the name, and other student organizations followed. In 1946, the cougar was named the official mascot by the University as Houston as it became involved in intercollegiate sports. The next year, the Alpha Phi Omega fraternity raised funds to purchase a live cougar for the university, and held a contest to name it. Among 225 other entries, student Joe Randol won the contest with the following submission: \\"Shasta (She has to). Shasta have a cage, Shasta have a keeper, Shasta have a winning ball club, Shasta have the best.\\" The first runner-up was \\"Raguoc\\" (cougar spelled backwards). From 1947 until 1989 a live cougar mascot was used. However, from 1989 until 2012, Shasta existed as only a costumed mascot. Although a current live mascot was adopted by the university through a partnership with the Houston Zoo, a costumed student is still used for game appearances. Live mascots =Shasta I= Shasta I (1947‚Äì1962) was the longest serving Shasta. She was purchased in Mexico during the fall semester of 1947 by members of the Alpha Phi Omega fraternity. Student caretakers of Shasta were known as the \\"Cougar Guard\\", and were responsible for bringing the cougar to the football team's away games among other activities. Following her service as the University of Houston mascot, she resided at the Houston Zoo. =Shasta II= Shasta II (1962‚Äì1965) was the shortest serving Shasta, and was the first to live in \\"Shasta's Den\\" (a cage built for her) at the southwest corner of Lynn Eusan Park. It's said that she was retired so soon due to an unruly attitude. She later resided at the Houston Zoo. =Shasta III= Shasta III (1965‚Äì1977) was also known as \\"The Lady\\". She was featured in several commercials for the American Motors Corporation, but was forced to retire due to poor health. =Shasta IV= Shasta IV (1977‚Äì1980) was also known as \\"Baby Shasta\\". She only served three years due to the difficulty in controlling her. =Shasta V= Shasta V (1980‚Äì1989) was the last female cougar of the original continuous line to serve as a live mascot for the University of Houston. After a kidney failure, she was euthanized. After Shasta V, interim President George Magner ended the tradition of a live mascot at the university, until 2012. =Shasta VI= Shasta VI, The University of Houston's current live mascot with his trainer Shasta VI (2012‚ÄìPresent) was announced as the first live mascot at the university since 1989, in partnership with the Houston Zoo. Prior to the current mascot, there was much debate as to whether or not the university should purchase another cougar. Those who opposed another live cougar often claimed that having a caged cougar was inhumane and dangerous.Cougar pride . The_Daily_Cougar. Retrieved 18 September 2007. Shasta VI was born in September 2011 in the U.S. state of Washington, and was adopted by the university as a cub. Shasta's mother was killed in 2011, when a hunter shot her. After a search from the Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife, Shasta VI was rescued, and transported to the Houston Zoo on December 11, 2011. In March 2012, the University of Houston Alumni Association announced that the cub would be adopted. Although the Shasta mascot costume has been a male since 1989, Shasta VI is the first male live UH cougar mascot. Shasta VI was vested in a ceremony for alumni on 24 March 2012. Costumed mascots A costumed Shasta walking off the field of a football game at Robertson Stadium From 1989 through 2012, the university chose not to purchase another live cougar, and Shasta only existed as a costumed mascot. During this time, although a live cougar appeared in University of Houston's \\"Learning. Leading.\\" campaign named \\"Tigger\\", this cougar did not live on campus nor was it owned by the university. Another live mascot, Shasta VI was adopted in 2012 through a partnership with the Houston Zoo, but a costumed student is still used for game appearances. The costumed Sasha mascot eventually began making appearances with Shasta, and now the two are seen at many University of Houston events. =The Oregon Duck incident= During the 2007 football season opener game between the Houston Cougars and the Oregon Ducks at Oregon, the costumed Shasta became involved in a physical fight with Oregon's Donald Duck mascot. The duck attacked Shasta while Shasta was doing push-ups for total points after each touchdown in front of the Cougar fans at Autzen Stadium. Push-ups for the total points scored are a tradition for the University of Houston as well as Oregon. After finishing some push-ups, the duck mascot physically attacked Shasta, eventually taking the mascot to the ground. Shasta, actually portrayed by the football player Matt Stolt for the Cougars, tackled the duck and walked away. The duck answered by punching the Houston mascot in the face and then performing simulated lewd acts on top of the cougar. The fight was captured by both amateur video and game cameras, and was subsequently posted on YouTube as well as being reported on by most major media organizations including ESPN. University of Oregon's mascot was suspended for their next game against Fresno State as a disciplinary action. It was never revealed what further penalty the student in the duck suit faced.Oregon mascot suspended. Houston_Chronicle. September 14, 2007.

Plot A South Seas island prince is wrongly convicted of murder and executed by having a knife driven into his heart, the result of a plot by a witch doctor (the true murderer) who resented the prince's friendly relations with American scientists stationed on a field laboratory on the island. The prince is buried in a hollow tree trunk and forgotten about until nuclear radiation reanimates him in the form of the \\"Tabonga\\", a scowling tree stump.

On his mother's side, he was descended from the goldsmith and silversmith Paul Storr; his cousins thus included Rev. Vernon Storr, Archdeacon of Westminster from 1931 to 1936, Rev. Frank Utterton, Archdeacon of Surrey from 1906 to 1908, the obstetrician Sir Francis Champneys, 1st Baronet and his brothers Basil Champneys and Weldon Champneys, and the artists Rex Whistler and Laurence Whistler.Paul Storr 1771-1844, Silversmith and Goldsmith, N. M. Penzer, Hamlyn Publishing Group, 1971, pp. 16-17 He was educated at Gresham's School, Holt, and Balliol College Oxford. After Oxford, he became a lecturer at Yenching University in Peiping, China and American University in Washington, DC. Using his protected status as a foreign citizen, Lindsay began smuggling radio and medical supplies to the communist, who were resisting the Japanese occupation of China. He needed a native speaker of Chinese, so he recruited his student, Hsiao Li, whom he married on 25 June 1941. They had one son, James, born on 29 January 1945, and two daughters, Erica (1942-1993) and Mary Muriel (b. 1951). Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, Lindsay became a citizen of an enemy state and thus liable for arrest, but the pair managed to escape. For the next four years, they acted behind enemy lines. Lindsay first worked in the communists' Radio Department and then at the New China News Agency. Two children were born to them during their 500-mile journey on foot to the communist headquarters in Yenan: Erica, born in a hut in the mountains in 1942, and James, born in a hospital cave in Yenan in 1945.  Baron Lindsay of Birker  After the war, in 1945, Lindsay's father was created Baron Lindsay of Birker, and he moved to Britain with his wife, where they lived with his parents. They moved to Australia when Lindsay started lecturing at the Australian National University. In 1952, he succeeded to his father's barony. Seven years later, Lord and Lady Lindsay moved to Washington, D.C., where he taught at the Far Eastern Program at American University until his retirement in 1975. They remained there after he retired. They visited China in 1949 and 1954; in 1954, they functioned as official interpreters for an unsuccessful Labour Party delegation to China. Later, however, they were refused visas because of Lord Lindsay's criticism of the communist leadership. Lord and Lady Lindsay were only able to enter the country after the death of Mao Zedong. Lord Lindsay died in 1994, a year after his daughter Erica. He was succeeded by his son James, 3rd Baron.

Established in 1977, it is currently based in Toronto (with satellite offices in Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal), publishes 10 issues a year and has a total readership of 1.85 million (PMB Oct 2010). The magazine covers international, national and local fashion and beauty trends and news. It aims to reach affluent, style-conscious urban women. The magazine's first editor- in-chief was John MacKay, who had previously been responsible for Toronto Life's men's fashion supplements. The current editor-in-chief is Bernadette Morra. Previous to joining Fashion, Morra spent 23 years at the Toronto Star, first as fashion writer, then (since 1993) as fashion editor. She left the Star in 2008 to be a freelance writer and launch a website for jewellery lovers. Bernadette has reported from the runways of Milan, London, Paris and New York, and interviewed many top fashion designers, models and celebrities including Karl Lagerfeld, Marc Jacobs, Nicolas Ghesqui√®re, Victoria Beckham and Linda Evangelista. In 2009, FASHION launched its men's magazine Men's FASHION as a bi-annual special interest publication. In 2012, they added a Holiday issue, in addition to the Spring/Summer and Fall/Winter editions. The current editor-in-chief is Canadian journalist David Livingstone. St. Joseph Communications, the magazine's publisher, also publishes Toronto Life, Canadian Family, Weddingbells, Quill & Quire and Where Canada magazines. Website and digital brand expansion FASHION's website was first launched in the summer of 2000. In 2008, the brand made two significant efforts to expand their online presence. In March, FASHION announced a content partnership with MySpace Canada that included sharing behind-the-scenes news, videos and photo galleries. In April, the magazine announced a national \\"Reporter Search\\" in an effort to find 10 new style bloggers from across Canada who could write about fashion trends in their home communities. The eventual winners of the contest were given a year-long blog on the FASHION website and were also awarded other prizes. In a 2008 interview, online editor Jennifer Campbell outlined the multi-pronged strategy that was bringing the site success, which included daily blogging, community outreach, slideshows, newsletters and social media networking. At the time, the site received 100,000 visitors/month, and the most popular site sections were FASHION Lovelies (a weekly street fashion snap) and FASHION Reporters (the aforementioned blogs from the cross-Canada Reporter Search contest). Video played a large role in Fashionmagazine.com's early online strategy. In October 2009, the site was recognized with the \\"Best Video\\" award at the first year of the Canadian Online Publishing Awards. The site was a finalist for the same \\"Best Video\\" award in 2010, and won top prize in the \\"Cross-platform\\" category for an online men's style guide that contained online video. Randi Bergman is the current online editor. She replaced Campbell in December 2010 after the latter left for a role with rival Canadian fashion publication Flare. Shortly thereafter, Paige Dzenis joined the team as associate online editor. In 2011, the site was a finalist for \\"Website of the Year\\" at both the Canadian National Magazine Awards and the Canadian Online Publishing Awards. That same year, the website was extensively redesigned by Randi Bergman, Paige Dzenis, Laura Antonik, Gary Campbell and Michelle Darwin. Subsequently, the website won two silver awards at the 2012 Canadian National Magazine Awards‚Äîone for best digital design and one for best multimedia feature for the \\"At The Shows/Spring 2012\\" package. In August 2012, it was announced that FASHION had the largest Twitter following of any magazine in Canada, with 352,079 followers. This success was attributed to the brand being an early adopter of social media. In August 2013, the brand launched an online shopping extension called \\"FASHION Shopping\\" featuring 1,500 clothing and accessory items selected by the editors that can be purchased online. The eCommerce store works on both desktops and smartphones. In February 2020, the brand announces a shift towards #FashionForAll and celebrating inclusivity with a group of 7 cover stars who are advocates for inclusivity.

Outside Japan, it is not usually distinguished from urolagnia, though they are different things: the Handbook of Clinical Sexuality for Mental Health Professionals specifically defines omorashi as persistent sexual arousal toward a full bladder. Dr. J. Paul Fedoroff acknowledges this distinction, observing that \\"The theme of taking control of autonomic process is prominent in the paraphilia known as omorashi, which involves sexual arousal associated with the sensation of needing to urinate due to a full bladder.\\" Westerners who make the distinction sometimes use the term \\"bladder desperation\\" to do so, though some fetishist communities in the West adopt the more specific Japanese language terminology. The Japanese term \\"omorashi\\" means to wet oneself. The word is also occasionally romanized as \\"omorasi\\" in the Kunrei- shiki romanization system. In the English speaking BDSM community, the term bathroom use control is used to describe omorashi play in which the dominant controls how and when the submissive is allowed to use the bathroom. Attitudes toward sexuality in omorashi media Most fetish activities concerning the use of bodily waste are considered by the general public as \\"hardcore\\", taboo, or edgeplay. However, because the object of the fetish is clothed incontinence, omorashi videos do not necessarily feature direct sexual contact, though some use it as a form of foreplay. The focus on clothed (rather than overtly sexual images) makes garment fetishism a prominent feature in most omorashi erotica: commonly featured outfits include school uniforms, those worn by working professionals, and other people attempting to look dignified before succumbing to the need to urinate. Fetishists who are into this kink may have specific scenarios they enjoy, such as while waiting in line for a bathroom or just doing it for fun in front of the toilet. Regardless of their personal wetting preferences, everyone who is into this kink enjoys watching someone wet themselves or have an accident in clothing. Japanese subculture There are many ways in which omorashi fetishism is practiced in Japan. =Yagai= One of the variations is known as omorashi yagai, which translates as \\"to wet oneself outdoors (or publicly).\\" A further variation includes yagai h≈çny≈ç, or \\"outdoor (or public) urination\\", in which the subject publicly removes their clothes to urinate. Other yagai h≈çny≈ç practitioners operate much like graffiti artists, attempting public urination acts without being caught. =Diapers= Another variation of omorashi play is omutsu omorashi („Åä„ÇÄ„Å§„Åä„ÇÇ„Çâ„Åó) or omutsu play („Åä„ÇÄ„Å§„Éó„É¨„Ç§), less commonly called oshime omorashi („Åä„Åó„ÇÅ„Åä„ÇÇ„Çâ„Åó), both of which translate as \\"to wet oneself in a diaper.\\" This omutsu variation is essentially the same as the standard omorashi, except that the participants are wearing a diaper. Diapers may be favorable for public wetting because they render it more discreet and eliminate mess, and their use is not limited specifically to those with a diaper fetish. However, omorashi fetishists specifically interested in this aspect of the subculture could be considered a Japanese variation of the diaper lover community. Japanese acceptance of adult diaper use is comparatively high, with the market for such products growing as much as 6‚Äì10% a year. However, these are largely intended for and worn by the elderly, with the growth due to Japan's aging population, and younger people wearing these have met with some criticism. In 2012, the Japanese magazine SPA ran an article entitled \\"The Ultimate Form of Slob\\", which criticized the trend of young Japanese women who wear diapers to avoid public restrooms. The article included an interview with a 25-year-old woman who had been wearing diapers \\"instead of going to the toilet\\" for a period of six months, \\"wearing [them] almost every day.\\" = Skirt omorashi = Some individuals find it attractive when someone wets themself in a skirt, since it allows for upskirt views of the accident. This is referred to as sukƒÅto omorashi („Çπ„Ç´„Éº„Éà„Åä„ÇÇ„Çâ„Åó). This can combine with uniform fetishism, and pornography with skirted performers dressed as high school girls and office workers is common, as well as depictions of skirted people in casual dress. =Fetish films= In order to avoid Japan's strict censorship laws, which limited depictions of actual sex and pubic hair, erotic films (known as pink films) often relied on fetish elements which could skirt such restrictions. One such film, Terrifying Girls' High School: Lynch Law Classroom in 1973, would be the first to depict an omorashi scenario to a cinematic audience. As the AV (adult video) genre took hold in the 1980s, videos specifically devoted to omorashi began to appear. Several notable AV idols have starred in such scenes, including Sakura Sakurada. However, perhaps because of its softcore nature, omorashi never became a clearly pornographic genre. Today, Japanese omorashi fans also enjoy game show-style videos in which contestants must compete in various urine-holding challenges. The Giga video company's \\"Desperation Tournament\\" series is an example of this kind of contest. One such activity is a panel of contestants competing to hold their bladders, or to guess which woman has to use the restroom the most. =Periodicals= Since the 1990s, magazine companies catering to the Japanese kink community have produced a number of periodicals dedicated to omorashi subculture, including most notably Sanwa Publishing's Omorashi Club (rendered phonetically as the wasei-eigo „Åä„ÇÇ„Çâ„ÅóÂÄ∂Ê•ΩÈÉ®, or Omorashi Kurabu). First published September 22, 1994, Omorashi Club's success allowed Sanwa to extend the brand in 2006 to include a DVD magazine. The following year, the demand for material catering specifically to omutsu omorashi fandom led to further expansion with the spin- off periodical Diapers Club („Åä„ÇÄ„Å§ÂÄ∂Ê•ΩÈÉ®, or Omutsu Kurabu). The scarcity of earlier issues of these magazines has caused them to become collector's items. =Anime and manga= Japanese-produced omorashi media also include comic books and cartoons. These range from independently produced d≈çjinshi to large, commercially-produced manga. Some focus exclusively on omorashi stories, while others include only the occasional scene. Some contain obvious sexual themes and could be considered a form of H manga, while others, like Iinari! Aibure- shon, are well known to be suitable for all ages, since they have only mild ecchi content such as panchira. Wetting scenes have existed in anime as early as the popular Doraemon and Devilman series of the 1970s. However, these did not have the erotic context which characterizes modern omorashi media, since they predated the first full-blown anime pornography, which was not available until 1984, when the advent of the first H anime OVAs such as Wonder Kids' Lolita Anime were made possible by the widespread availability of home video. One example of this later erotic context is the 1994 H anime OVA Vixens, which features scenes of incontinence in a setting that is overtly sexual. =Eroge= An eroge (erotic game) is a Japanese video or computer game that features erotic content, usually in the form of anime-style artwork. The crossover of omorashi and anime fandom has produced a number of games such as Water Closet: The Forbidden Chamber which are specifically focused on omorashi. The limited popularity of omorashi in the West has prompted a number of programmers in the scene to create software patches for these Japanese games which translate the on screen text into English. Some eroge game designers have capitalized on the omorashi fandom's niche market by including the occasional wetting scene in their games as a selling point. MAID iN HEAVEN SuperS, for example, which contains only a single, diapered wetting scene, was used to spin-off an entire set of collectible figures in various omorashi poses. These PVC model figures were created by toy manufacturer Giga Pulse, which is not related to the video company of similar name. =Collectibles= A promotional image of collectible Shizukuishi kyuun kyuun toilet paper, with images from the omorashi comic Iinari! Aibure-shon. With the translation of omorashi into manga and its subsequent adoption by otaku fandom, a number of omorashi themed collectibles have appeared on the Japanese market, including figurines and \\"Shizukuishi kyuun kyuun toilet paper\\" printed with wetting scenes featuring the character Shizukuishi from the omorashi manga, Iinari! Aibure-shon. Outside Japan Though there is a small community devoted to such fetishism outside Japan, it is usually overshadowed by the more hardcore fetishes, urolagnia and urophagia. Vice Media has documented an account of an omorashi community existing in the United States since at least 1970. Outside Japan omorashi groups sometimes refer to their shared interest as \\"desperation/wetting\\" fetishism, often making a distinction between content featuring males and females. In 2018, People magazine and the New York Post reported the use of the English language portmanteau word \\"peegasm\\" among people who practiced \\"releasing urine after a long period of time\\" in order to achieve \\"a stimulation of pelvic nerves\\" that \\"could feel like an orgasmic response.‚Äù Some English language fetish websites with a focus on females simply identify as \\"panty wetting.\\" Since such sites abandon the \\"desperation\\" title which implies an effort not to wet, they are more likely to include nudity, overtly sexual models and situations, as well as purposeful (as opposed to accidental) wetting. There are still communities which focus on the more tame or softcore aspects of omorashi, which are generally focused on simple wetting in fully or semi-clothed situations without the overtly sexual models and situations. However, this softcore side is more rare in English- speaking communities than the more explicitly sexual omorashi content. Though there is generally no wide acceptance of incontinence-based play, studies in England have shown that urinary incontinence during sexual activity is a \\"common, but rarely volunteered symptom\\" observed in 24% of sexually active women. Moreover, no connection could be identified with any specific abnormality of bladder function associated with these symptoms, indicating that such leakage is both normal and healthy. =Western publications and media= Because of the western stigma in numerous countries against urine, omorashi subculture has not received such diverse exposure in non-Japanese media. In some countries, governments have even banned such materials. In New Zealand for example, creating, trading, distributing (e.g., making available on one's web page) anything promoting or supporting \\"the use of urine or excrement in association with degrading or dehumanising conduct or sexual conduct\\" is a felony punishable by up to ten years in jail. Nonetheless, urination is a common fetish in pornography; the 1915 film A Free Ride, widely considered the first pornographic film made in the USA, contains scenes of urination. Print An early example of urination and skirt-wetting appearing in a sexualized context in the west can be found in the 1928 erotic novel Story of the Eye. Underground periodicals dedicated to pants wetting subculture outside of Japan began to appear in the 1991 with the British underground magazine Cascade, which collected erotic letters related to the fetish that occasionally appeared in older publications such as Feista and combined them with original stories, drawings, and photography. This was followed in 1993 by the Australia-based Wet Set Magazine. Wet Set publications were originally only available in English, but readership in German speaking countries proved high enough to justify printing some materials in German. Such publications facilitated the burgeoning subculture by providing opportunities for contact between its members via personal ads. The importance of these printed materials declined with the advent of the internet, and both Cascade and Wet Set ceased publication of physical magazines in the 21st century as the subculture shifted increasingly toward message boards and social media. Though Wet Set did not generally acknowledge the comparatively large Asian fan base over any other country, it exposed its readers to the Japanese kink community through articles reporting on that subculture's activities. During the 21st century, some Western writers on the subject of omorashi began to recognize the Asian influence upon the subculture in a more direct way. For instance, in a February 2006 issue of The Brooklyn Rail, American poet Garrett Caples of Oakland, California chose to describe the shooting of an omorashi film in a Japanese setting. Aside from lending Western omorashi media an \\"authentic\\" quality, the inclusion of Japanese models and settings might also be seen as an attempt to play upon the stereotype of ultrapassivity globally associated with Asian women, further enhancing their perceived moe qualities and catering to Asian fetishists. Film The 2002 award-winning film Secretary depicted a scene of bathroom use control resulting in the submissive wetting her dress. =Fashion= Despite omorashi subculture's intrinsic relationship to garment fetishism, taboos in the west against relating sexuality and urine prevented mainstream acceptance of overtly sexual garments related to incontinence until the 21st century, when New Zealand-based underwear brand Confitex debuted a line of incontinence lingerie at New Zealand Fashion Week 2015. The organizers stated in a press release that \\"This is the first time, anywhere worldwide, that incontinence underwear has graced a catwalk as a designer range.\\" In Cosmopolitan Magazine's coverage of the event, they proclaimed that \\"You Can Feel Sexy Even if You Leak,\\" despite the ban existing in that country against promoting or supporting incontinence-based play. The Sweden-based brand TENA subsequently followed the precedent set by Confitex with their Silhoutte Noir line of disposable incontinence undergarments, which were designed to \\"dismantle taboos around incontinence.\\" Anna McCrory, senior brand manager for TENA UK, explained the goal of the product as \\"helping women to feel sexy, confident and able to wear what they like without being restricted by the colour or shape of their underwear, an important step towards normalising incontinence.‚Äù In 2019, Greek fashion designer and performance artist Dimitra Petsa released a collection entitled Wetness showcasing pants \\"dyed in such a way that it seems someone peed in them.\\" According to Petsa, the idea for her design came from a piece of performance art in which she deliberately wet herself on a crowded subway in Athens. In a subsequent interview, she explained that though she initially experienced shame at peeing her pants publicly, \\"Afterwards I felt very free and powerful, but at the same time I felt very naked.\\" She went on to state that models who were asked to wet their pants during the presentation of the collection experienced it as \\"an emotional process\\" and an \\"eye opening experience.\\" She described this as \\"the ultimate metaphor for letting go -- both of my bodily fluids and of my shame\\" and explained that \\"shaming is an effective way of keeping women under control. I think that‚Äôs one of the main reasons why shame is such a central theme in my work.\\" Similar sentiments regarding fashion as a tool for overcoming stigmas against adults wetting themselves were previously expressed by the organizers of a 2008 Japanese fashion show for adult diapers aimed at Japan's increasingly elderly population, in which an organizer stated that \\"Diapers are something that people don't want to look at, but if you make them attractive, then people can learn about them more easily.\\" See also * Diaper fetishism * Garment fetishism * Panty fetishism * Salirophilia * Urolagnia References Works cited  Sexuality and society Japanese sex terms Anime and manga terminology Japanese subcultures Japanese pornography Fetish subculture Urine ","title":"Omorashi"},{"id":"9744351","text":"View of platforms is a railway station in the city of Natori, Miyagi, Japan, operated by third-sector railway operator Sendai Airport Transit (SAT).

In early 1866, local entrepreneur Samuel Platt discovered the presence of brine while drilling for oil in the community. He subsequently developed a salt extraction business, using an evaporation process. This discovery inspired the development of several salt extraction operations in the immediate area, eventually culminating in the opening of the Sifto Salt mine in nearby Goderich, currently (2007) the third largest salt producer in the world. Saltford's name has been changed several times throughout its history. In 1834, brothers William and Robert Dunlop named their settlement on the north shore of the Maitland River Gairbraid, after their mother's home in Dunbartonshire, Scotland. The name changed to Bridgend Place, Maitlandville, and finally in 1879, Saltford.Rayburn, Alan Place Names of Ontario (University of Toronto Press), Toronto-Buffalo-London,1997, ), pg.305 History Pre 1900 In 1866 Samuel Platt was drilling the northern bank of the Maitland river in search of oil.

Universitario hosts the practise of a large variety of sports and activities, including aikido, mountaineering, basketball, boxing, scuba diving, fencing, skiing, football, gymnastics, artistic gymnastics, golf, field hockey, judo, swimming, yachting, paddle tennis, basque pelota, rugby union, squash, taekwondo, tennis, volleyball, windsurf and yoga.Sports at CUBA, retrieved 15 April 2017 One of the sports the club had gained more recognition is rugby union, which senior team currently plays in Top 12, the first division of the Uni√≥n de Rugby de Buenos Aires league system. \\"CUBA\\" has won 14 first division titles to date.  History  The Club was founded on May 11, 1918, by a group of university students as a means of fostering camaraderie in a politics-free environment. The main request to become a member was to be a university student. In 1917, after a basketball game played in the Young Christian Association -which ended in a riot act- some of its members were punished. Many of those members would establish the club one year later.History of CUBA on club's website The first president of the institution was Dr. Carlos P.Waldorp.\\"El Club Universitario de Buenos Aires y el Rugby\\" by Eduardo Garc√≠a Saenz, rugbytime.com, 8 May 2014 (Archive) On 31 October 1918, the club acquired a house on Viamonte street of Buenos Aires, which would be the headquarters of Universitario. From 1933 to 1948 (when Universitario acquired land in Villa de Mayo district of Greater Buenos Aires), the club hosted its activities at the club Obras Sanitarias.  Rugby union  Universitario rugby team of 1924. It is believed that rugby union began to be practiced at the club because of the friendship between members of Club Atl√©tico San Isidro and the founders of CUBA. Furthermore, the first CUBA captain was Oscar Mena that had previously played in San Isidro. He arrived at the club not only to play but to serve as a coach of junior divisions. Universitario registered its rugby team with Uni√≥n del Rugby del R√≠o de la Plata (today Argentine Rugby Union) in 1919. At the beginning the team only played friendly matches, debuting against Lomas with a victory of 16‚Äì3. Universitario would they play San Isidro, Belgrano AC and Lomas again. Universitario started to take part in official competitions in 1922, playing at the Uni√≥n de Rugby de Buenos Aires second division. The first official game was on May 15, 1921, when \\"CUBA\\" defeated Huemac by 11‚Äì0 in the Club Metropolitan field sited in Santos Lugares. Universitario won the championship without being defeated, therefore promoting to the top division of Argentine rugby. Only two players of that team had experience in playing rugby, Julio Dellepiane Rawson and Rodolfo de Surra (that had played in San Isidro and Eastbourne College of England, respectively).\\"CUBA, campe√≥n despu√©s de 43 a√±os\\", Clar√≠n, 6 May 2014 = First championship = URBA championship. Universitario won its first title in the first division in 1931. The team won 14 of 16 games, with a loss (to current champion San Isidro by 25‚Äì0 with 7 tries conceded) and 1 game drew (against Gimnasia y Esgrima de Buenos Aires). Universitario scored 213 points (43 tries), receiving 77. Universitario recovered from the thrashing defeat by San Isidro, making a great campaign and winning all the games of the second round, including a victory against San Isidro by 12‚Äì6, taking revenge from the first-round game. At the international level, Universitario played several matches against teams outside Argentina, such as the Junior Springboks in 1932 and 1959, an Oxford & Cambridge combined team in 1948, 1956 and 1965, the Ireland national side in 1952 and the \\"Gazelles\\" from South Africa in 1966. Nevertheless, the most significant achievement for the club was in 1965 when Universitario won the title in all divisions (First to fifth, including reserve teams). = Return to glory = Forty-three years had to pass before Universitario won a new title in 2013. In 2006 and 2007 the team reached the semi-finals and was near to be relegated in 2010 and 2011. That same year Universitario had to play a match against Lomas to remain in the top division.\\"CUBA, una historia de reconstrucci√≥n\\" at RugbyFun In 2013 Universitario won its 14th championship, defeating Hind√∫ by 11‚Äì9 in San Isidro.\\"\\", CanchaLlena.com, 26 Oct 2013 That same year Universitario became the national champion when winning the Nacional de Clubes after defeating Rosarian team Duendes by 21‚Äì20 at a final match played in Villa de Mayo.\\"CUBA es el mejor del pa√≠s: derrot√≥ a Duendes en la final del Nacional del Clubes\\", CanchaLlena.com, 3 May 2014\\"CUBA luch√≥, gan√≥ y grit√≥ campe√≥n\\" , 3 May 2014 ‚Äì UAR website = Notable rugby union players = * Frank Chevallier Boutell El Gr√°fico N¬∞ 377 (Sep 1926)Rugby Did√°ctico 3: Historia y Estad√≠sticas by Sebasti√°n Perazzo.

Building Ulm HfG, photography by Hans G. Conrad. Model for the continuous study of the workshop of Tomas Maldonado. The Ulm School of Design () was a college of design based in Ulm, Germany. It was founded in 1953 by Inge Aicher-Scholl, Otl Aicher and Max Bill, the latter being first rector of the school and a former student at the Bauhaus. The HfG quickly gained international recognition by emphasizing the holistic, multidisciplinary context of design beyond the Bauhaus approach of integrating art, craft and technology. The subjects of sociology, psychology, politics, economics, philosophy and systems-thinking were integrated with aesthetics and technology. During HfG operations from 1953‚Äì1968, progressive approaches to the design process were implemented within the departments of Product Design, Visual Communication, Industrialized Building, Information and Filmmaking. The HfG building was designed by Max Bill and remains intact today as a historically important and functional building under the auspices of Foundation Ulm. The HfG was the most progressive educational institution of design in the 1950s and 1960s and a pioneer in the study of semiotics. It is viewed as one of the world's significant design schools, equal in influence to the Bauhaus.Lindinger, Herbert. (1991) Ulm Design: The Morality of Objects , The MIT Press. Spitz, Ren√©. (2002) The Ulm School of Design: A View Behind the Foreground, Edition Axel Menges. The history of HfG evolved through innovation and change, in line with their own self-image of the school as an experimental institution. This resulted in numerous changes in the content, organization of classes and continuing internal conflicts that influenced the final decision of closing the HfG in 1968. Although the school ceased operation after fifteen years, the ‚Ä≤Ulm Model‚Ä≤ continues to have a major influence on international design education. History Poster designed by Margarete K√∂gler in the class of Otl Aicher. =Background and early political history= The postwar years, between 1945 and 1952 in West Germany were characterized by heavy restructuring and financing plans, such as the Marshall Plan.. The origins of HfG go back to an initiative by the brother-and-sister Scholl Foundation. The Scholl Foundation was created in 1950 by Inge Scholl in memory of their siblings Sophie and Hans Scholl, members of the resistance group \\"White Rose\\", executed in 1943 by the National Socialists (Nazis). In 1946 Inge Scholl along with Otl Aicher and a group of young intellectuals considered creating a teaching and research institution to foster the humanistic education ideal and link creative activity to everyday life. They would seek this goal in context of the cultural reconstruction of German society morally destroyed by Nazism and World War II. The project was funded through the influx of a million marks by John McCloy of the American High Command for Germany in the post-war governing structure. Through contacts with Max Bill and Walter Gropius, the Foundation also received financial support from the German Federal Financial Directorship and from the European Aid to Europe as well as private contributions and industry funding.Gay, Achilles and Samar, Lidia (2004),The History of Industrial Design , C√≥rdoba: Ediciones TEC. . Page 137. Clock designed by Max Bill for Junghans during his time at the HfG. HfG began operating the new college in 1953 with Max Bill, a former student at the Bauhaus, as rector. On 3 August of that year, operations were begun in rooms at the Ulm ‚ÄòVolkshochschule‚Äô (institution for adult education) with a faculty consisting of Josef Albers, Johannes Itten and Walter Peterhans (former Bauhaus instructors) and Helene Nonn√©-Schmidt (Bauhaus graduate). Later HfG faculty would include Hans Gugelot, Otl Aicher, Tom√°s Maldonado, Friedrich Vordemberge-Gildewart and Walter Zeischegg. Distinguished visiting lecturers were invited from a variety of disciplines and included: Mies van der Rohe, Walter Gropius, Charles and Ray Eames, Herbert Bayer, Josef M√ºller-Brockmann, Reyner Banham, Buckminster Fuller, Hugo H√§ring, Konrad Wachsmann, Norbert Wiener and Mia Seeger. The teaching was based on a curriculum covering four years. The first academic year was devoted to the basic course and then students chose a specialty from Product Design, Visual Communication, Industrialized Building, Information (which lasted until 1962) and Filmmaking, which until 1961 belonged to the Visual Communications department since 1962 and became independent. In 1953 the new building was started, designed by Max Bill, and the inauguration took place on October 2, 1955. The HfG building complex was one of the first in Germany built as reinforced concrete structures with spacious workshops, dormitories and a cafeteria. The interiors and furnishings were designed for flexible use and outdoor terraces were often used for lectures. =Internal conflicts= Bench designed by Max Bill. This versatile functional design furniture was used for multiple purposes in the workshops of the HFG Ulm. In 1956 Max Bill resigned as rector, due to changes in the body of academic development and differences in the approach to design school teaching. Tom√°s Maldonado took his place as rector. Bill continued to teach but finally left the school in 1957. Max Bill favored a teaching approach that followed the continuation of the \\"heroic\\" Bauhaus tradition, based on the Arts and Crafts model, in which the artist-designer saw their primary role in product development as form-giving. A key objective of the Bauhaus was also to ensure the form-giving artist-designer considered the technology of materials and mass production methods. However, many teachers at HfG, especially those of theoretical courses, sought to emphasize analytic methods encompassing sociological, economic, psychological and physiological considerations. Among them was Tom√°s Maldonado, who saw the design process as a system embodying both scientific-based and intuitive-based thinking. Aesthetic considerations were no longer the primary conceptual basis of design. The professional designer would be an \\"integrator\\" with responsibility for integrating a large number of specialties in addition to aesthetics, mostly the diverse requirements of materials, manufacturing and context of product use, as well as considerations of usability, identity and marketing.Maldonado, Tom√°s. \\"New developments in the training industry in product design\\", in: \\"ulm\\", 2 October 1958, p. 31 Under the leadership of Maldonado, the school dropped the \\"artist\\" focus of Max Bill and proposed a new philosophy of education as an \\"operational science\\", a systems-thinking approach which embodied both art and science. Corporate Identity Design for Lufthansa. Max Bill's departure also heralded a new phase: the creation of \\"development groups\\" that were created specifically to create links with industry. Many of the resulting designs went into production immediately. Among the most successful was audio equipment for the company Braun, corporate identity for the German airline Lufthansa and elevated trains for Railroad Hamburg. These industrial commissions brought a wealth of experience in teaching and decisive influence to the school and enhanced its reputation. In the fall of 1958 a major exhibition was held in the HfG five years after its opening. The HfG was presented to the general public for the first time, showing both the results of work from student workshops and the work of teachers. That same year also came the first issue of the HfG magazine \\"ulm\\", which was published in German and English, and lasted until the school closed in 1968. The formal education process continued to evolve during the 1960s. Teachers such as the mathematician Horst Rittel, sociologist Hanno Kesting, and industrial designer Bruce Archer were in favor of a design methodology based primarily on analytical studies, including business analysis. This approach caused internal conflicts as Otl Aicher, Hans Gugelot, Walter Zeischegg, and Tom√°s Maldonado resisted such an overly analytical emphasis and claimed instead that the design process had to be more than strictly a 'method of analysis'. It must be a balancing of both art and science, such as with the study of semiotics. Cup as part of stackable tableware for hotels designed by Hans Nick Roericht for thesis work during 1958 and 1959. The consequence of this debate was a great exhibition of work that had been created in the classes of HfG and showcased the successful balancing of art and science. The show was initially in Ulm and Stuttgart in 1963, later in the Neue Sammlung, Munich, and in the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam. In addition to the fundamental debate over curriculum, changes were made in the constitution and the reintroduction of a single rector to replace the Board of Governors. =Closure of HfG= 'Family' squabbles over the direction of the curriculum, led to a press attack in 1963 against HfG. The Parliament of Baden- Wuerttemberg repeatedly discussed whether the school deserved subsidies. The problems were becoming more frequent. After the unsuccessful Parliament demand that HfG join the Ulm School of Engineering, Federal subsidies were abolished and the financial situation became untenable. With the cessation of grants, the School Foundation was in debt. In 1968 some teachers were dismissed because of the difficult financial situation and the number of classes was reduced. In November, the Regional Parliament voted to withdraw all funding, therefore, the school was closed amid protests later that same year. Curriculum Vehicle designed by Klaus Krippendorff for the final graduation project of Product Design. The curriculum lasted 4 years. The first year was devoted to the basic design course (Vorkurs) that was intended to offset the deficit in primary and secondary education in terms of creative project activity. The second and third years were for elective specialization: Product Design, Industrialized Building, Visual Communication and Information, with Filmmaking being added later. The last year of study was intended for thesis. The plan was subject to investigations that were made in regard to new approaches to design and which were then implemented in each department of the specialties. =Basic Course= Students of all programs shared the same basic design course, which lasted a year. This course was mandatory before proceeding to one of the five specialization programs offered by the institution. The course content was: * Visual experiments: two- and three- dimensional studies based on the perceptions and teachings of symmetry and topology. * Workshops: wood, metal, plastics, photography, etc.. * Presentation: constructive drawing, writing, language, freehand, etc. * Methodology: introduction to logic, mathematics, combinatorics and topology. =Department of Product Design= Project Scooter-Van of the second year of Product Design. Design by Michael Conrad, Pio Manz√π and Fritz Busch. The product design department was the one who had more achievements and that radically changed the vision of industrial design. The development of new methods of mass production during the Second World War implored the designer to stop focusing primarily on the artistic point of view of the profession. Therefore, HfG teaching put increased emphasis on science and technology considerations, more in keeping with the times, and on industrial production processes that determine the final product quality and affect the product aesthetic form. * Instruction in manufacturing: product design, operational organization, processes, procedures, calculations. * Technologies: Ferrous metals, nonferrous metals, wood, plastics and forming technologies. * Construction techniques. * Mathematical analysis of operations: Group theory, statistics, standardization. * Scientific theories. * Ergonomics: Human- machine systems. * Theories of Perception, especially social * Mechanics: Kinematic, dynamic and static. * Copyright and miscellaneous. =Department of Visual Communication= At first the department was called Visual Design, but it quickly became clear their goal was to solve design problems in the area of mass media, so that in the 1956/56 academic year the name changed to Visual Communication Department. The curriculum included the development and implementation of visual reports, news systems and transmission media. Emphasis included the field of planning and analysis of modern means of communication, with a clear focus on the illustrative arts. Maldonado also introduced the study of semiotics. This department worked closely with the Department of Information. Although HfG distanced itself from an affiliation with the mass media advertising industry. The HfG worked primarily in the area of persuasive communication in areas such as vehicular and pedestrian traffic sign systems, plans for technical equipment, visual translation of scientific content to be readily understood and unity of company communications materials. Teaching approach Schematic teaching of HFG Ulm. The school design was characterized by formulating a scheme based education in art and science. In the early years of operation, and with the direction of Max Bill, the teaching of the school was guided by the principles of the Bauhaus, where the designer had a profile of being much more artistic than analytic. Based on the discrepancies between Bill's approach and that of other teachers, including the systems principles of Tom√°s Maldonado, the school shifted its ideology to a more methodological and structured field of study, but one that also strongly embraced aesthetics as a primary factor. This resulted in an academic program with a common basic course and an introduction to consolidated theoretical disciplines. The new design teaching approach became known as the \\"Ulm Model\\" which significantly influenced worldwide design education, especially industrial design, as the HfG reputation spread and many HfG graduates established Ulm-influenced education programs around the globe. Collaboration with Braun Midway through the 1950s, the HfG and Braun, began a phase of cooperation. Braun needed to stand out from the competition and asked Otl Aicher, Hans Gugelot, and students to work on new designs for the company. Dieter Rams, who was a newly hired Braun designer, collaborated with HfG on developing the forward-looking Braun product design approach. With this partnership the \\"Braun style\\" was developed, and according to Tom√°s Maldonado, \\"the style differed from Olivetti who sought unity in variety, while the style of Braun sought unity in the product and its coherence with other products. Because of this, the Braun-HfG collaboration was a formidable test bench for the design of \\"honest\\" form and coherent identity as an alternative to the random \\"styling\\" of individual objects.\\"Styling\\", Maldonado, Thomas. Industrial design review. Barcelona, Ediciones Gustavo Gili. 1977, page 77. Legacy Until the founding of the Ulm HfG in 1953, there was no systematic approach of design education. HfG pioneered the integration of science and art, thereby creating a teaching of design based on a structured problem-solving approach: reflections on the problems of use by people, knowledge of materials and production processes, methods of analysis and synthesis, choice and founded projective alternatives, the emphasis on scientific and technical disciplines, the consideration of ergonomics, the integration of aesthetics, the understanding of semiotics and a close academic relationship with industry. In concept, the \\"Ulm Model\\" represented early foundation principles of the design management discipline. The Ulm School of Design buildings designed by Max Bill and the surrounding green spaces are well maintained, used by various organizations and considered important heritage.  Exhibits  Between September 2011 and April 2012 the Disseny Hub Barcelona held an exhibition about the Ulm School of Design.

He graduated the United States Military Academy in 1845. As a lieutenant in the 2nd Dragoons, he was assigned to duty in Texas and then in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. He was cited for gallantry for his actions at the battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma. He plotted out 84 city blocks with stakes and rawhide rope, as the foundation of what is now Las Cruces, New Mexico. In 1848, during the summer, he was with 87 soldiers of the First Dragoons of Company H, charged with defending homesteads from Apache raids.

The couple had a daughter, but Mrs. Sackett died in August 1849 in Arkansas while her husband was serving on the frontier.Chronicles of Oklahoma In December 1850, Sackett returned to West Point as Assistant Instructor of Cavalry Tactics, serving until April 1855. With the rank of captain in the 1st U.S. Cavalry, he went to Kansas Territory to Fort Leavenworth and served on various expeditions against hostile Indians. He then served on a variety of posts around the country and took a leave of absence for an extended trip to Europe. He was serving in the Indian Territory when the Civil War erupted.

At the outset of the war, Sackett, then the lieutenant colonel of the 5th U.S. Cavalry, was assigned to Washington, D.C. as the Acting Inspector- General of the Department of Washington. He held that position until August 1861, when he was reassigned as the Mustering and Disbursing Officer for New York City until December, spending much of his time helping to organize newly recruited troops. In late December, he joined the Army of the Potomac as its Inspector General, serving in that role until January 1863. He was in the Peninsula Campaign as a staff officer and advisor to Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan and again during the Maryland Campaign. After serving under Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside at Fredericksburg, Sackett took command of the Inspector General's Office in Washington. He then served on a variety of military boards (helping to organize the Invalid Corps) until April 1864, when he was sent to the Western Theater on inspection duty for the Departments of the Tennessee, Cumberland, Arkansas, and New Mexico. On December 3, 1867, President Andrew Johnson nominated Sackett for appointment to the grade of brevet major general in the regular army, to rank from March 13, 1865, for \\"faithful and meritorious services during the Rebellion,\\" and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on February 14, 1868.Eicher, John H., and David J.

After spending a year in New York City awaiting orders, Sackett was sent to the Montana Territory on an inspection tour, and then went on to the Pacific Coast. He was then assigned as Inspector General of the Department of the Tennessee from November 1866 through to March 1867. He served in the same role in a variety of posts until 1881, when he returned to Washington as a brigadier general and Inspector General of the U.S. Army, a post he held until his death in Washington at the age of 63 of gangrene. He was buried in his native Cape Vincent, where he had built an impressive house in 1872. Post # 268 of the Grand Army of the Republic in Cape Vincent was named for Delos B. Sackett.

Baseball pocket billiards or baseball pool (sometimes, in context, referred to simply as baseball) is a pocket billiards (pool) game suitable for multiple players that borrows phraseology and even some aspects of form from the game of baseball. For instance, although baseball pool is played on a standard pool table, the 9 ball is known as the \\"pitcher\\", the table's where balls are racked is known as \\"home plate\\", and each team or player is afforded \\"nine innings\\" to score as many \\"runs\\" as possible. Baseball pocket billiards has been in existence since at least 1912, when Brunswick soberly described it in a pamphlet as \\"the most fascinating game of the twentieth century.\\" The game has relatively simple rules. The winner is the player with the highest run tally after all players have taken nine turns \\"at bat\\". Gameplay =Set-up= Full setup Baseball pocket billiards is played with 21 numbered . Since a standard set of pool balls is numbered 1 through 15, sets of balls numbered 16 through 21, known as \\"baseball sets\\", have been marketed specifically for the game, along with the oversized triangle racks needed for proper . The balls are racked at the end of a pool table, with the of the triangle centered over the (\\"home plate\\"). Viewed from the racker's vantage point, the 1-ball is placed at the triangle's apex, the 2-ball at the right corner, and the 3-ball at the left corner, similar to that of rotation. The 9-ball, called the \\"pitcher\\", is placed at what would be the center of the rack if the game were to be played with 15 balls. All other balls are placed randomly. Because most physical racks only accommodate 15 balls, the last row of balls may be placed manually after placement with a standard triangle. The opening break and subsequent breaks, if any (see infra), are performed with the from the (behind the table's ). =Object of the game= Baseball pocket billiards is a game, meaning a player must call the ball to be hit and the intended pocket on all shots but for the . Any incidental balls pocketed on a successful called shot count in the player‚Äôs favor but must be spotted to home plate if unsuccessful. Each player is allowed nine at the table, played in succession, in which to score as many runs as possible. The game ends when all players have completed their rounds. The winner is the player with the most runs after all have finished their turn \\"at bat\\". =Scoring= Each legally pocketed balls garners the shooter the numerical face value of the ball. For example, pocketing the 2- and 15-balls during an inning results in a score of 17 runs for that . Scores must be contemporaneously recorded on a score sheet with the total tally for each inning marked. If a player pockets all 21 balls before his inning allotment ends, the balls are re-racked and play continues, with a re-break from the kitchen. Each inning continues until a player misses a ball or commits a . =Penalty for fouls= The penalty for a foul is a loss of turn, no score for the ball or balls pocketed on the fouled stroke, as well as no score for the immediately preceding pocketed ball during any inning. This means that if a player did not legally pocket a ball on the preceding the foul, the last ball pocketed in the last scoring inning is spotted and subtracted from that prior inning's score. All balls on a fouled stroke are to home plate. If the player has not yet made any balls at the time of the foul, the first subsequent ball pocketed is spotted at the inning's conclusion and does not count toward the player's score.

It was built in 1918 by the Dominicans; the attached priory serves as the headquarters of the Eastern United States Province of the order. Its architecture has some unusual features: above the front entrance is one of the few statues of the Crucifixion on the exterior of an American Catholic church; and inside, the Stations of the Cross depict Christ with oil paintings instead of statuary or carvings. It has two Schantz pipe organs. The church building, at the corner of Lexington Avenue and East 66th Street in the Lenox Hill section of the Upper East Side, has been called \\"one of New York's greatest architectural adornments.\\" Tom Fletcher's New York Architecture The church is under the patronage of Saint Vincent Ferrer, a Dominican preacher from Valencia, Spain. It was made a New York City designated landmark in 1967. Seventeen years later, in 1984, the church and priory, designed in 1881 by William Schickel, were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. St. Vincent Ferrer High School for girls is on its grounds and is administered by resident Dominican Sisters. Members also work in charitable efforts like local shelters and food pantries. They are also involved in interfaith lobbying for affordable housing in Manhattan. Grounds The church complex comprises four buildings, all on the block between East 65th and 66th on the east side of Lexington. Across the street are low rowhouses; just to the north are the Seventh Regiment Armory, a National Historic Landmark, and the apartment building at 131‚Äì35 East 66th Street, also a city landmark. The entire site is less than The address of the church, as listed in 1892, was 871 Lexington Avenue.The World Almanac 1892 and Book of Facts (New York: Press Publishing, 1892), p.390. Within the site, four buildings ‚Äì the church, priory, Holy Name Society building and St. Vincent Ferrer High School ‚Äî are connected by adjoining walls. All are architecturally compatible, but only the church and priory are considered contributing properties due to their age and simpler architecture. The cruciform church is built of limestone laid in a random ashlar pattern on three sides. The east (rear) elevation, barely visible from the street, is faced in brick. On the west, facing Lexington Avenue, is the five-bayNew York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, ; February 28, 1967. tower. It has two engaged octagonal towers flanking the large rose window, with stone tracery forming conjoined trefoils, in the center of the upper stage. Below the window is a tall round-arched entryway and stone steps topped with a carving of the Crucifixion. On the north and south the bays are divided by buttresses supporting the steeply pitched copper roof Inside, the entire nave is finished in the exterior limestone. In addition to the rose window, all the side windows are filled with stained glass. Pews and choir stalls are in ornate carved wood, and the altar is set off by a carved stone reredos. At the rear the oak pulpit is decorated with carvings in medieval Gothic style. The Stations of the Cross are represented by oil paintings. A large four-manual console in the choir controls the two Schantz pipe organs, Opus 2145 in the choir and Opus 2224 in the west gallery. The interior also features two relics of St. Vincent Ferrer in the church and the only example of a hanging pyx that is not in a museum. The priory, at the northeast corner of 65th and Lexington, is a five-story brick building on a brownstone foundation. Its facades are decorated with alternating stone and brick voussoirs, arched openings, stone bands at the imposts, pilasters and buttresses. The roofline is lined with stone and brick corbels below the cornice, with elongated stone corbels on the projecting gabled entrance tower in the center of the east (front) facade. A high brownstone stoop with cast iron newels and rails leads from the street to a deeply recessed, arched first floor entrance with clustered colonnettes. The mix of the brick and stone with the slate tiling on the dormer-pierced mansard roof gives the building a polychromatic effect. The Holy Name Society building and school are both similar structures of brick and stone. Much of their detailing and ornament, such as their buttresses and tracery, echoes or mirrors that found on the church and priory. The Society building and school date to 1930 and 1948 respectively and are not considered sufficiently historic to be included in the National Register listing with the church and priory at this time. History =19th century= In the 1860s, a Dominican priest from France, Father Thomas Martin, was sent to the Diocese of New York and took up residence in a brownstone on Lexington Avenue and 62nd Street. Others followed, and the Dominicans became popular among the city's Catholic population. John McCloskey, the archbishop of the Diocese of New York and the first American cardinal, asked them to establish a parish on what is now the Upper East Side. Father Martin and the other priests borrowed $10,000 ($ in contemporary dollars), bought 18 lots totaling at the present location and began to construct a chapel on the northeast corner of 65th Street. The first Mass was offered in this chapel on July 2, 1867.Remigius Lafort, S.T.D., Censor, The Catholic Church in the United States of America: Undertaken to Celebrate the Golden Jubilee of His Holiness, Pope Pius X. Volume 3: The Province of Baltimore and the Province of New York, Section 1: Comprising the Archdiocese of New York and the Diocese of Brooklyn, Buffalo and Ogdensburg Together with some Supplementary Articles on Religious Communities of Women.. (New York City: The Catholic Editing Company, 1914), p.379. Priory on south side By 1879 the construction was expanded and on December 12, a second church was dedicated. Its first Mass was celebrated on the feast day of St. Vincent Ferrer, September 8, 1879. At the same time the order decided to build a priory at the church to serve as its provincial headquarters. It commissioned William Schickel, a German-born architect who had recently completed his first major work in New York, the John Crimmins House at 40 East 68th Street. The priory's intricate use of materials and its overall polychromy, characteristics of the High Victorian Gothic style popular in the late 19th century, reflect Schickel's training in Bavaria and the strong influence there of Friedrich von G√§rtner. It was the first of many buildings Schickel would design for the New York diocese. Five years later, in 1884, the first school was built. =20th and 21st centuries= The church would serve the congregation until 1914, when it was demolished in order to begin construction of a new one designed by Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue, who had recently struck out on his own from Cram, Goodhue & Ferguson. While it was being built, the congregation worshipped in a temporary building at East 67th Street. alt=A drawing of a church with high, sloping roof and a narrow tower with open belfry off to the right of the roof ridge The architect wrote to a friend that he considered St. Vincent Ferrer his best Gothic work; he designed the Gothic Revival church in the style of 14th-century French Gothic, with echoes of Romanesque. Lee Lawrie's carving of the Cross above the entrance was the first time one had been located on the exterior of an American Catholic church, and is still one of the few instances. Guastavino tile was used on the interior to provide for excellent acoustics;. Goodhue had Charles Connick's stained glass windows positioned so that the colors complemented each other. He also decided that, reflecting the Dominican Order's Spanish origins, the representations of Christ at each of the Stations of the Cross would be oil paintings rather than the statuary or carvings more commonly used in American Catholic churches. The images were painted by Telford and Ethel Paullin in imitation of styles from different countries and eras, which accounts for the changing color of Christ's robe between them. As originally planned the church was to have a fifteen-story fleche. As construction progressed that became unfeasible. A former stream that passed under the site, as well as the construction of the IRT Lexington Avenue Line subway tunnels, made it impossible to lay a sufficient foundation. On October 22, 1916 the construction of the present incarnation of St. Vincent was completed, at a cost of $1.5 million ($ in contemporary dollars). It was dedicated on May 5, 1918, when over 50,000 people attended. In 1930 the Holy Name Society building was constructed. It was one of architect Wilfrid Anthony Edwards' many designs for the Catholic Church, and considered one of his best overall. The oaken High Pulpit was installed in the sanctuary. Its 14th-century French Gothic detailings were consistent with the church's architecture. alt=The church shown previously with the sidewalk covered and screens and scaffolding along either side. The school building quickly outgrew its intended design, and a new one was built over it in 1948. Architects Elliott Chisling-Ferenz & Taylor designed a building with sympathetic Gothic motifs that help it blend into the older buildings. Following Vatican II in the 1960s, the Dominicans replaced their rite with the standard Roman Rite Mass of Paul VI. A new altar was installed at the front of the choir, while the original High Altar at the rear continues to be used for reserving the Blessed Sacrament. During the late 1960s and 1970s Andy Warhol, a devout Byzantine Catholic who lived nearby, attended Mass regularly at St. Vincent Ferrer. Father Sam Matarazzo, the priest at the time, remembers him sitting quietly in the back of the church, taking neither communion nor confession. He speculated that Warhol, one of many gay men who attended services at St. Vincent Ferrer despite Matarazzo's regular preaching of Catholic doctrine opposing homosexuality, was perhaps afraid of being recognized. Warhol himself said he was self-conscious about being seen crossing himself \\"the Orthodox way.\\" Later in the 20th century, contributions from William E. Simon and an anonymous donor allowed the church to purchase the newer of its two Schantz pipe organs. In the early 2000s a capital campaign allowed the church to install new heating and cooling systems, and restore its exterior. That latter project was complete in 2009. On May 8, 2015, the Archdiocese of New York announced the merger of parishes between St Vincent Ferrer and St. Catherine of Siena Church. Both churches will remain open. Programs and services The church celebrates Mass three times a day and four times on Sunday. Vigils are observed on Saturday nights and the evenings before Holy Days of Obligation. The Sacrament of Reconciliation (confession) is offered all evenings except Sunday. The Liturgy of the Hours is observed by the Dominican friars daily in the Friars' Chapel which is open to the public. Outside the church, the congregation's Social Concerns Committee coordinates involvement in charitable work in the area. Members host holiday parties and bingo games at the Women's Shelter in the neighboring Park Avenue Armory, staff the Yorkville Common Pantry and assist members of nearby Jan Hus Presbyterian Church in feeding the homeless on Tuesday nights. The congregation is also a member organization of East Congregations for Housing Justice, which advocates for affordable housing in Manhattan. Notable people Andy Warhol regularly attended Mass at the church.

Schlemmer was interested in the birdlife of the island and made several studies which provide information on historic bird populations. However, Schlemmer and his family unwittingly introduced rabbits to Laysan, leading to the extinction of the Laysan rail and Laysan millerbird and permanently changed the island's ecology in the early 20th century. A biography of Schlemmer was written by his grandson, Tom Unger. Early life Schlemmer was born in 1856 to German parents living in Scheibenhardt, on the border of Germany and France. He moved to New York in 1871 fearing the advance of the Prussian army into France and worked for several years aboard whaling ships before moving to Kauai in 1885 to live in a \\"German town\\" called Lihue.Unger:5 Schlemmer worked for some years at a sugar mill and applied his mechanical skills to a small railroad system for transporting material at the mill. He married Auguste Bomke on September 5, 1886 at the Lutheran church in Lihue. Auguste had three children (Marianne called Mary, Auguste called Gussie and Max Jr.) and after her death he married Auguste's younger sister, Therese, on March 22, 1895. Therese had several more children with him.Unger:23 Schlemmer obtained a job in the North Pacific Phosphate and Fertilizer Company which extracted nitrate from the guano obtained from islands where birds nested in large numbers, particularly Laysan Island. Schlemmer, his family, and two workers moved to Laysan and were the sole humans occupants, leading to the jocular epithet of \\"King of Laysan.\\" They continued to mine guano even after the company that he worked for moved out their operations. \\"King of Laysan\\" Schlemmer was made superintendent of the guano operation in 1896. Soon after, he left to open a bar and boardinghouse on Kauai during which time a Japanese miner on Laysan was murdered during a dispute between American and Japanese workers. In the ensuing court case, the existing superintendent was removed and Schlemmer returned to Laysan again. The North Pacific Phosphate and Fertilizer Company sold their mining rights to Schlemmer, and he in turn sold them to a Genkichi Yamanouchi of Tokyo, allowing him to export anything from Laysan. Yamanouchi used this permission to export not guano, which had been mostly depleted, but bird feathers. Max Schlemmer hired Japanese workers, and together they slaughtered over 300,000 birds. They were starved, had their wings removed, tossed aside on the beach, and slowly baked and died in the sun. Photo of eggs being harvested. The girl in hat is Ottilie, Schlemmer's daughter. With the creation of the bird reservation in 1909, however, these activities became illegal, and Schlemmer was removed from the island. The rabbits that he had previously let loose now became uncontrolled and ravaged the island for food. The US Biological Survey sent a crew to exterminate them in 1913, but ran out of ammunition after 5,000 were killed, leaving a substantial number still alive. Schlemmer was unable to live away from Laysan, and in 1915 the government allowed him to return while denying his request to become a federal game warden. With nothing to eat on the bare island, Schlemmer's family nearly starved before they were rescued by the USS Nereus. With World War I having broken out and the subsequent anti-German paranoia, Schlemmer found himself accused of being a German spy using Laysan as his headquarters. Repercussions of the rabbit outbreak Not all of the animals on Laysan were hardy enough to survive the following few years, during which time Laysan lost most of its vegetation. Many species consequently became extinct in the early 1920s, including the Laysan rail (which survived on other islands for a while), the Laysan millerbird, and the Laysan fan palm. The Laysan finch was able to survive by scavenging other dead birds, and the Laysan duck survived because its diet of brine flies was unharmed.

Biography  Karnaviƒçius was born in Kaunas, Lithuania, which at the time was a part of the Russian Empire. After completing his basic education in his homeland, he began the study of Law in St. Petersburg, Russia. Karnaviƒçius' son, also named Jurgis Karnaviƒçius (1912‚Äì2001), was a pianist and the long-time rector of the Lithuanian Academy of Music. His grandson, Jurgis Karnaviƒçius (born 1957), is a concert pianist. Music had always been his main interest, and he began to simultaneously study music theory and composition. This soon superseded his pursuit of a career in the legal profession. His primary instrument was the viola. Eventually he became a professor at the Conservatory of Music in the now renamed city of Leningrad. During this period he began experimenting with his own theories of musical composition and began writing his own works. In 1927, Karnaviƒçius returned to Lithuania, which had only regained its independence as a sovereign nation less than ten years earlier. In addition to teaching at the Conservatory of Music in Kaunas, he opted to play the viola with the orchestra of the State Opera for a number of years. Having a personal desire write a new opera himself, and under the influence of the renewed national pride released by Lithuania's regaining its independence, Karnaviƒçius began to write his first opera, Gra≈æina, which premiered on February 16, 1933. It had incorporated more than forty melodies borrowed from Lithuanian folk songs, and was a popular success. It is considered among the first of the \\"Lithuanian National Operas\\".

It is the first album to feature the members of the classic quartet of himself with McCoy Tyner, Jimmy Garrison, and Elvin Jones. In contrast to his previous album for Impulse!, this one generated much turmoil among both critics and audience alike with its challenging music. Background In 1961, Coltrane created controversy both with the hiring of Eric Dolphy and with the kind of music his band was playing. In reaction to the Quintet's residency at the Village Vanguard in New York City starting in late October 1961, Down Beat critic John Tynan described the group as \\"musical nonsense being peddled in the name of jazz\\" and \\"a horrifying demonstration of what appears to be a growing anti-jazz trend.\\"Lewis Porter. John Coltrane: His Life and Music. Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press, 1999. , p. 193. European critics and audiences also had difficulty with appearances earlier in the year, finding the group's music, especially that of Coltrane and Dolphy, puzzling and difficult to follow.Porter, p. 194. Down Beat magazine editor Don DeMichael took the step of inviting the pair to defend themselves, a piece appearing in the April 12, 1962 issue entitled \\"John Coltrane and Eric Dolphy Answer the Critics\\".Ben Ratliff. Coltrane: The Story of A Sound. New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2007. , p. 143.David A. Wild. The Complete 1961 Village Vanguard Recordings. Impulse IMPD4-232 liner notes, p. 12. It was the idea of new producer Bob Thiele to record Coltrane live over four nights in early November, Thiele meeting the saxophonist for the first time face-to-face at the club.Impulse IMPD4-232 liner notes, p. 12. This commenced a close working relationship between Thiele and Coltrane that would last for the rest of his time at Impulse!, Thiele producing virtually every subsequent album. Thiele secured Coltrane's trust right away by not insisting he record his most popular song, \\"My Favorite Things\\", during these shows.Ratliff, p. 75. Sound engineer Rudy Van Gelder set up his equipment at a table by the stage,Impulse IMPD4-232 liner notes, p. 15-16. and for these concerts Coltrane often enhanced the Quintet by adding tampura,wrongly labelled as oud in the disc notes contrabassoon, oboe, or a second bass. These were Reggie Workman's final recordings with the group, as by December 1961 Garrison was announced as his replacement, stabilizing a line-up that would remain constant for the next four years.Porter, p. 200. (Garrison's performance on the album marked the first time he had played with the group.) Two additional recordings taken from these shows appeared on the album Impressions, \\"Impressions\\" and \\"India\\". On September 23, 1997, Impulse! issued a box set The Complete 1961 Village Vanguard Recordings, with the sets from all four nights chronologically on four compact discs. Music Three performances (two original compositions and one jazz standard) were chosen for the album. \\"Spiritual\\", played by a quintet featuring Coltrane on tenor and soprano saxophones (the album credits only list the soprano; however, Coltrane acknowledged playing both instruments on the piece in a 1966 interview) and Eric Dolphy on bass clarinet, is possibly an adaptation of \\"Nobody Knows de Trouble I See\\" published in The Book of American Negro Spirituals by James Weldon Johnson.Porter, p. 206. Coltrane stated: \\"It's a piece we'd been working with for some time because I wanted to make sure before we recorded it that we would be able to get the original emotional essence of the spiritual.\\" \\"Softly, as in a Morning Sunrise\\", a pop standard, is played by a quartet with Coltrane again on soprano sax. Coltrane stated that the piece \\"seems to me to round out the two originals, and I especially like the swinging by Jones...\\" The third selection, the blues \\"Chasin' the Trane\\", is seen by some as \\"the birth cry of sixties avant-garde jazz: an outpouring of stylistic tongues and melodic ideas that linked the bebop dexterity and daring of the past with a free, stripped- bare, spiritually charged future,\\" and was described by Coltrane biographer Ben Ratliff as \\"a great statement...\\",Ratliff, p. 72. his \\"landmark performance of the period\\",Ratliff, p. 73. and \\"one of the most important recordings in jazz as it is currently practiced.\\" One notable aspect of the track is the fact that it was recorded as a trio, without Tyner, freeing Coltrane, who plays tenor sax, from the harmonic underpinnings normally provided by the piano. Jimmy Garrison, the bassist on \\"Chasin' the Trane\\", had recently played with Ornette Coleman's piano-less quartet,Ratliff, p. 74. and, in a 1961 interview prior to the recording, Coltrane expressed great admiration for Coleman and acknowledged his influence, stating that \\"there probably will be some songs in the future that we're going to play, just as Ornette does, with no accompaniment from the piano at all.\\" Coltrane also noted: \\"When I played with Monk... I played many times without a piano: Monk... after two pieces, would return to the dressing room or even stand looking out the window for two or three hours. So, we played without a piano.\\" The absence of a piano, along with a rhythm section playing with what Gary Giddins called \\"formidable concentration\\", allowed Coltrane to \\"stretch out\\" on \\"Chasin' the Trane\\". Coltrane stated that \\"the melody not only wasn't written but it wasn't even conceived before we played it. We set the tempo, and in we went.\\" (Ratliff wrote that the piece \\"just vaults into being,\\" and is \\"remarkable for the way it starts at absolute full intensity and retains that level without peaking or deflating.\\") According to Ratliff, in his solo, Coltrane \\"trips up the internal 12-bar logic. He causes patterns to change every bar, or stretches a single pattern across the 2nd and 3rd bar, or the 4th and 5th, or three in a row. In under a minute, Garrison, walking in hiccupped phrasing... loosens himself from the 12-bar structure; Coltrane (and Jones) still demarcate the end of the 12 bars by the beginning of a new melodic idea and an emphatic cymbal crash... at two and a half minutes in, Coltrane starts to disregard the 12-bar markers, and he's off, at large, exploring texture, fooling with short, sweet melodies...\\" Aspects of the solo reflect the influence of John Gilmore's \\"run-on language of short motivic cells\\", which Coltrane confirmed, stating: \\"I'd listened to John Gilmore kinda closely before I made 'Chasin' the Trane'... So some of those things on there are really direct influences of listening to this cat.\\" Nat Hentoff wrote that Coltrane's solo on \\"Chasin' the Trane\\" is \\"particularly fascinating for the astonishing variety of textures Coltrane draws from the full range of his horn,\\" reflecting the fact that \\"when he developed his embouchure to reach the higher notes on the soprano, he started to think in higher pitch ranges for the tenor. He began to play much more of his instrument...\\" Coltrane also explores multiphonics and split tones; Eric Nisenson wrote that \\"he squeals, wails, and cries through his saxophone\\" during the solo. \\"Chasin' the Trane\\" is in part successful because of the tension between what Gary Giddins called Coltrane's \\"desire to pare down harmony and escape any form ‚Äî chords, choruses, the tempered scale ‚Äî that keeps him from an elusive grail of total expressiveness\\" with the fact that \\"Garrison and Jones follow him... but whenever he threatens to push beyond the blues, they bring him home.\\" Giddins wrote: \\"In pushing jazz orthodoxies to but not through the wall, Coltrane employs everything he has learned in order to challenge the validity of what he had already mastered... No matter how far afield he goes, he upholds the playful quality of the theme, recurrent and childlike, for the duration of the performance.\\" Ratliff stated that \\"Chasin' the Trane\\" \\"is a unifier. This recording, precisely, is what free jazz and straight-ahead jazz... have in common.\\" Reception Pursuant to the article by Coltrane and Dolphy, for the following April 26 issue Down Beat presented two reviews of Live! at the Village Vanguard, both focusing on \\"Chasin' the Trane\\". Pete Welding described it as \\"a torrential and anguished outpouring, delivered with unmistakable power, conviction, and near-demonic ferocity.\\"Porter, p. 196. On the other hand, Ira Gitler, who had coined the phrase \\"sheets of sound\\", stated that \\"Coltrane may be searching for new avenues of expression, but if it is going to take this form of yawps, squawks, and countless repetitive runs, then it should be confined to the woodshed.\\" Writing in 2020 in his Substack-published \\"Consumer Guide\\" column, Robert Christgau found the \\"relaxed \\"quietude of side one\\" to be \\"lovely enough\\" but went on to say, \\"this endlessly rereleased album is sacred for one reason: a second side consisting entirely of the 16-minute 'Chasin' the Trane,'\\" which he regarded as equal in importance to Louis Armstrong's \\"West End Blues\\" (1928) and the Beatles' \\"She Loves You\\" (1963). He said the album track \\"both evoked and rendered unto history a theretofore unknown species of chaotic command\\", with \\"Trane wailing and whaling on tenor as Jones furiously drives and depth-bombs and bassist Jimmy Garrison tirelessly anchors and intensifies (and Dolphy is said to interpose brief alto commentary, though I‚Äôve given up on figuring out where)\\". Writers have acknowledged the sheer emotional impact of \\"Chasin' the Trane\\". In his liner notes, Nat Hentoff wrote: \\"Listening to Coltrane in this unyielding performance is so absorbing because it allows the outsider to be present at an uncompromising act of spontaneous creation. Usually, even in jazz, some polishing has been done beforehand to avoid at least some of the dangers of unbridled improvisation; but here the whole piece comes newly and unpredictably alive before us. It is possible, therefore, to experience vicariously that rare contemporary phenomenon - a man going for broke. And in public no less. If you can open yourself emotionally to so relentless a self- exploration, you can gain considerable insight into the marrow of the jazz experience and into Coltrane's own indomitably resourceful musicianship through this whirlpool of blues.\\" Eric Nisenson wrote that on \\"Chasin' the Trane\\", \\"Coltrane's playing is the most intensely emotional of his career... Analyzing the tune technically is beside the point - it is an experience, a catharsis shared by Coltrane and his audience, and it is unlike anything that preceded it... 'Chasin' the Trane' is especially hair-raising because it is clear that Coltrane has dug deeply into his psyche to create this music - 'cleaning the mirror,' as he would put it a few years later. The music sounds as if it is a portrait of the raw stuff of his inner being, music so frankly confessional we feel slightly embarrassed listening to it. It is, in its subjectivity, in the tradition of the most innovative twentieth-century art and literature. This type of inner-driven improvising was key to Coltrane's quest. By looking within, he was trying to find a center of both that musical 'essence' and the mind of God. From here on, most of his music would similarly be a result of his 'cleaning the mirror.'\\" Gary Giddins stated that \\"Chasin' the Trane\\" was \\"the most vivid documentation of [Coltrane's] struggle to date,\\" describing it as \\"preeminent and indispensable... a sweat-soaked fury of resolute musical invention\\" He wrote: \\"Gone are the piano, routine theme, harmonic substitutions, auxiliary soloist(s), call-and-response, and conventional duration. He attenuates the music still more by draining his virtuoso technique ‚Äî sanding the shine off his sound, indulging a glossary of false notes, overtones, and vocalisms. He pushes himself and the blues to the limits of endurance, drawing light from dark, pleasure from pain, liberation from constraint.\\" Coltrane biographer J. C. Thomas described \\"Chasin' the Trane\\" as \\"fifteen minutes and fifty-five seconds of energetic, expressive changes and counterchanges, interpolations and improvisations in a continuous stream-of-consciousness creation that would leave listeners shaking their heads not in negation but disbelief that such a difficult project had not only been attempted but had also emerged with such musically successful results.\\" He noted that, during the performance and recording, \\"Max Gordon was nodding his head so forcefully that it seemed ready to snap off... Bob Thiele was tapping his feet hard enough to wear down his heels, puffing so fiercely on his pipe that he nearly insulated himself in a smoke screen of his own making... Rudy van Gelder was a study in near-perpetual motion, following Coltrane around as closely as a bill collector and keeping one of his microphones just inches from the leader's tenor saxophone at all times, even though he had to climb over half the customers to do it.\\" (Van Gelder suggested the title \\"Chasin' the Trane\\" for the previously-untitled piece partly as a result of his having to scramble to maintain good microphone placement \\"with Coltrane swinging his saxophone and stalking the small stage of the basement club.\\") Archie Shepp recalled the first time he heard \\"Chasin' the Trane\\": \\"I was living in a loft in [New York's] East Village in 1962. I heard my neighbor's record player booming and I knew it was Trane. But the piano never came in. As he began to develop the line it became clear that the structure wasn't so apparent and he was playing around with sounds: playing way above the normal scale of the horn, neutral and freak notes, overtones, and so on. I found it as shocking a piece of music as Stravinsky's 'Rite of Spring' was in his day... the song's form is much less important than the melody itself, and the relation between the melody and the rhythm. Sonny Rollins had worked without piano before, but his playing was primarily harmonically oriented ‚Äî and Ornette Coleman too, who was totally aharmonic. Coltrane was able to integrate the two, to put everything in context, in such a sophisticated way that it influenced everybody. [Without the piano] it's the point where the Coltrane Quartet became an avant-garde trio... ['Chasin' the Trane' was] a synthesis of what came before. You could say that it's free jazz, but it's not totally free because there are still very strong structural indications: chords, harmony. Trane said that 'Giant Steps' [1959] was sort of the end of one phase where he had exhausted all of the permutations of chords. 'Chasin' the Trane' was another door that opened: the use of sound for sound itself... I think it's one of the most innovative pieces in the history of African-American improvised music, as important as Charlie Parker's 'Ko-Ko' [1945] or Coleman Hawkins' 'Body and Soul' [1939]. That's the greatness of Trane, that he always kept the feeling of dance and the spiritual elements so important to what they used to call 'hot jazz.' That's why his peers all respected him so much, because he didn't throw the baby out with the bathwater.\\" Track listing =Side one= =Side two= Personnel * John Coltrane ‚Äî soprano saxophone on side one; tenor saxophone on side two * Eric Dolphy ‚Äî bass clarinet on \\"Spiritual\\" * McCoy Tyner ‚Äî piano on side one * Reggie Workman ‚Äî bass on side one * Jimmy Garrison ‚Äî bass on side two * Elvin Jones ‚Äî drums References External links * Live at the Village Vanguard Albums produced by Bob Thiele John Coltrane live albums 1962 live albums Impulse!

They were under the command of American merchant and maritime fur trader Captain Robert Gray. History In early August 1791, John Kendrick had arrived in Clayoquot Sound and bought land from Wickaninnish in exchange for firearms. The land was near the native village of Opitsaht. By the time Gray arrived on the Columbia Redivia in late August for trading, Kendrick had fortified a small island and given it the name Fort Washington. Kendrick soon left for China, while Gray remained for the winter. For most of the winter relations with Wickaninnish and his people were good. On Christmas Day Wickaninnish and a number of other chiefs dined aboard the Columbia, and on New Year's Day, the Americans were entertained onshore by the natives. =Construction= Launch of Adventure with Fort Defiance and Columbia in background. Painting by George Davidson, who served as an artist on Columbia The men of Columbia began building their winter quarters on September 21, 1791.Howay. p. 247 They completed the main building by September 30. This structure measured long by wide and was two stories tall. Fort Defiance also had a brick fireplace, as the traders had brought with them 5,470 bricks from Boston.Scofield. p. 242 The main building had two cannons mounted and musket loop holes for defending against native attacks.Howay. p. 382 Additionally, other buildings constructed included a blacksmith shop, two sawpits for cutting logs, cabins, and a boat builder's shed.Howay. p. 305 Once the fort was complete, four cannons, 40 muskets, and various other weapons were transferred from the Columbia; Robert Haswell was placed in charge of the base and ten men.Howay. p. 248, 305, 382 At this point, the crew at Fort Defiance began construction of the ship on the frame that Columbia had brought.Scofield, John. p. 241 =Use= On October 3 the keel was laid for the ship.Howay. p. 248 Over the winter the ship slowly began to take shape.Howay, Frederic W., p. 227 On February 23, 1792, the ship was launched, making it the first American-built vessel in the Pacific Northwest.Howay. p. 313-314, 276Carey, Charles Henry.

He is famous for having a 33 cm (13 inch) long tail, which has made him an object of devotion to many, who believe him to be an incarnation of Hanuman, a Hindu deity associated with monkeys.Indian man‚Äôs 13-inch tail Daily Times June 22, 2006Confessions of Emergency Room Doctors Rocky Lang, Erick Montero, Andrews McMeel Publishing, 2007 , Length-208 pages  Object of devotion  Oram was born on the date known as Rama Navami, which is the birthday of legendary Hindu king Rama who is considered to be an incarnation of Vishnu, one of the many Gods as per Hinduism. According to the Ramayana, Hanuman was devoted to Rama, and helped him rescue his wife, Sita, who was being held captive by an evil king. As a consequence of his apparent resemblance to Hanuman, Oram has been visited by large numbers of people who wish to receive his blessings. Some of his followers also report miraculous healings of severe ailments after touching his tail. Oram claims to enjoy other aspects of monkey-like behaviour, including jumping, climbing, and eating bananas. Oram has set up a shrine to honour Hanuman, on top of which there is a red silk flag, which is Hanuman's symbol.  Clinical explanation  According to physicians, the tail Oram has is not a real tail, but a congenital malformation known as spina bifida, in this case of the rare meningocele category. It is possible for human embryos to develop a real tail, as the genes which cause it still exist in many people. However, the probability of this gene expressing is very low: it can happen because of rare recessive gene coupling, or some form of mutation that brings the gene back to a dominant place. That is why very few cases have been recorded in the history of medicine. The presence of these kind of vestigial structures is known as an atavism. When a human embryo develops a true tail, it is located as a prolongation of the coccyx, just like the tail of a dog or a monkey. Oram's tail emerges from his lumbar region, which is a clear sign that it is caused by split spine. The tail consists of a 33 cm (13 inches) long and 25 mm (1 inch) thick appendix to the bone of the spine. It is covered by much hair.  Social issues  Oram has refused any operation to remove his tail. According to his family, it has become a part of him which he could not live without. However, this also has its costs, as he has been unable to settle down and raise a family of his own. He has reported that approximately twenty women have rejected offers of marriage because of his tail. He has said: \\"I have decided to marry the woman who accepts me and my tail. Or else, I'll remain a bachelor like Hanuman.\\" Oram was married in 2007 and has a child. According to his wife, \\"He doesn't look good. My mother and my father passed away when I was young. My brothers wanted me to get married, so I had to compromise and marry him.\\"http://theviralpost.com/man-with-tail-hailed-as-monkey-god Notes Year of birth missing (living people) Living people People from Alipurduar district People with spina bifida ","title":"Chandre Oram"},{"id":"9745090","text":"Duke Ellington & John Coltrane is a jazz album by Duke Ellington and John Coltrane recorded on September 26, 1962, and released in February 1963 on Impulse!

These books, also called the Named series, are about intelligent self-aware large cats who have puma, cheetah and lion characteristics, and are based on fossil creatures who are ancestors of the saber-tooth cat. The first book in the series, Ratha's Creature appeared in 1983. The flap copy on the paperback re-issue of Clan Ground (the second book in the series which appeared in 1984) states that Bell: :is a scientist, engineer, and author whose work has taken her to Norway to build electric cars, to Tahiti for research, to Marine World/Africa United States to meet a cheetah and into the depths of prehistory to develop the Ratha series...The author blends science and fantastic projection in her depiction of the Named ‚Äì- cheetah-like cats with an organized society. Readers who followed Erin Hunter's Warriors series about feral cats have gone on to read the Ratha series. Bell's love for big cats is also expressed in Tomorrow's Sphinx (about cheetahs in past and future Egypt) and The Jaguar Princess (a werecat (jaguar) woman in Aztec Mexico). Bell is also fascinated with flight, writing People of the Sky about Pueblo Indians who migrate from Earth to another planet and learn to ride winged aliens. Bell's short stories have appeared in the Witch World and CatFantastic (cats and magic) anthologies, both edited by science fiction and fantasy writer, Andre Norton. Recently Bell composed Ratha's Island, an experimental novelette written specifically for the Twitter microblogging service, which intentionally limits posts to 140 characters or less so that they can be read on cellphones and other portable wireless devices. Ratha's Island is an early entry into the area of Y/A Twitter fiction and has been well received. It is similar to the phenomenon of cellphone novels which are popular in Japan. The piece ran on Twitter beginning on March 14, 2009 and ending on May 9, with blocks of 5-10 Tweets, appearing twice daily during that time. Ratha's Island also explored the possibilities of alternative evolution in hexapodal (six- legged) as opposed to quadrupedal (four-legged) prehistoric mammals that evolved on an isolated island.

After attending the University of California, Santa Cruz Gale Reference Team, \\"Biography - Bell, Clare (Louise) (1952-),\\" Contemporary Authors (Biography) (Thomson Gale, 2003) she used her training in biology and chemistry by working as a hydrological and geological field technician for the US Geological Survey, serving on the USGS research vessel Polaris, based in Redwood City, California. Returning to college under the Women in Engineering Program at the University of California, Davis, she then joined IBM in San Jose, California as an electrical engineer. Inspired since childhood by Olaf Stapledon's novel Sirius: A Tale of Love and Discord, about a sheep dog with human-level intelligence, she began writing Ratha's Creature, the first novel of the Named series.

Ratha's Creature was also adapted for television animation and aired as a CBS Storybreak episode in the late 1980s. Leaving IBM in 1990 to begin a full-time writing career, Bell also became interested in electric vehicles. After converting a VW beetle to electric with a conversion kit, she began building, racing, repairing, designing, and racing electric cars. From 1992 to 1999 also became the editor of the Electric Auto Association's (a nationwide US electric car club) monthly newsletter, Current Events. As part of the Women's Electric Racing Team, she competed in the Arizona Public Service utility company's APS Solar and Electric 500 and APS Electrics electric vehicle races, held in Phoenix, Arizona from 1993 to 1997. She also turned her electric vehicle experience into a profession, working as an electric vehicle engineer for CALSTART and private companies until 2003. Bell found to her surprise that books written nearly twenty years ago still had fans and had been kept alive on the Internet. The first four Ratha titles were reissued as Firebird paperbacks in Summer and Fall 2007, and a new book, Ratha's Courage, was published by Imaginator Press in October, 2008.

The Episcopal Diocese of Indianapolis, formerly known as the Episcopal Diocese of Indiana, is a diocese in Province V (for the Midwest region) of the Episcopal Church. It encompasses the southern two-thirds of the state of Indiana. Its see is in Indianapolis, Indiana, at Christ Church Cathedral. According to the diocesan newsletter, the diocese has 10,137 communicants in 49 parishes. The current bishop is Jennifer Baskerville-Burrows, the first African-American woman to serve as diocesan bishop in the Episcopal Church and the first woman to succeed another woman as a diocesan bishop in the Episcopal Church; Catherine Waynick served as bishop of the diocese from 1997 to 2017. History Like many of the Episcopal diocese in the Midwest, the history of the Diocese of Indianapolis begins with the consecration of Jackson Kemper as Missionary Bishop of the Northwest in 1835. At the time, Indiana was a wilderness and the first Anglican meetings were often held in remote Methodist and Presbyterian churches, as well as courthouses, stores, schoolhouses and private homes. Kemper founded several Indiana churches; the oldest one still standing is Saint John's Church in Crawfordsville, Indiana. The Episcopal Diocese of Indiana was formed in 1849 with the consecration of George Upfold as bishop of Indiana. The first cathedral was Saint John's Church in Lafayette, Indiana, because it was the only parish with a parsonage at the time. Within a few years, Upfold moved the episcopal residence to Indianapolis, where Saint Paul's Church, Grace Church, and All Saints' Church served as the cathedral before it was moved to Christ Church in 1954. Christ Church was consecrated as the pro-cathedral for the diocese on October 10, 1954. In 1898 the Episcopal Diocese of Indiana was divided to create the Episcopal Diocese of Indianapolis, covering the southern two-thirds of the state, and the Episcopal Diocese of Northern Indiana, covering the northern one-third. Churches in the Diocese The Episcopal Diocese of Indianapolis is made up of 48 parishes across the lower two-thirds of the state of Indiana: * All Saints Episcopal Church, Indianapolis, Indiana * Chapel of the Good Shepherd, West Lafayette, Indiana * Christ Church Cathedral, Indianapolis, Indiana * Christ Church, Madison, Indiana * Church of the Nativity, Indianapolis, Indiana * Episcopal Campus Ministry at Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana * Good Samaritan Episcopal Church, Fishers, Indiana * Peace Episcopal Church, Rockport, Indiana * St. Alban's Episcopal Church, Indianapolis, Indiana * St. Andrew's Episcopal Church, Greencastle, Indiana * St. Augustine Episcopal Church, Danville, Indiana * St. Christopher's Episcopal Church, Carmel, Indiana * St. David's Episcopal Church, Bean Blossom, Indiana * St. Francis-in-the-Fields Church, Zionsville, Indiana * St. George's Episcopal Church, West Terre Haute, Indiana * St. James Episcopal Church, New Castle, Indiana * St. James' Episcopal Church, Vincennes, Indiana * St. John's Episcopal Church, Bedford, Indiana * St. John's Episcopal Church, Crawfordsville, Indiana * St. John's Episcopal Church, Lafayette, Indiana * St. John's Episcopal Church, Washington, Indiana * St. Luke's Episcopal Church, Cannelton, Indiana * St. Luke's Episcopal Church, Shelbyville, Indiana * St. Mark's Episcopal Church, Plainfield, Indiana * St. Mary's Episcopal Church, Martinsville, Indiana * St. Matthew's Episcopal Church, Indianapolis, Indiana * St. Michael's Episcopal Church, Noblesville, Indiana * St. Paul's Episcopal Church, Columbus, Indiana * St. Paul's Episcopal Church, Evansville, Indiana * St. Paul's Episcopal Church, Indianapolis, Indiana * St. Paul's Episcopal Church, Jeffersonville, Indiana * St. Paul's Episcopal Church, New Albany, Indiana * St. Paul's Episcopal Church, Richmond, Indiana * St. Peter's Episcopal Church, Lebanon, Indiana * St. Philip's Episcopal Church, Indianapolis, Indiana * St. Stephen's Episcopal Church, New Harmony, Indiana * St. Stephen's Episcopal Church, Terre Haute, Indiana * St. Stephen's Episcopal Church, Elwood, Indiana * St. Thomas Episcopal Church, Franklin, Indiana * St. Timothy Episcopal Church, Indianapolis, Indiana * Trinity Episcopal Church, Anderson, Indiana * Trinity Episcopal Church, Bloomington, Indiana * Trinity Episcopal Church, Indianapolis, Indiana * Trinity Episcopal Church, Lawrenceburg, Indiana Bishops of the Diocese The bishops of the diocese in order are: # Jackson Kemper, I Indiana, (1838‚Äì1849) # George Upfold, II Indiana, (1849‚Äì1872) # Joseph Cruickshank Talbot, III Indiana, (1872‚Äì1883) # David Buel Knickerbacker, IV Indiana, (1883‚Äì1894) # John Hazen White, V Indiana, (1895‚Äì1899) Knickerbacker worked with the Episcopal General Convention to split the Diocese in two to better serve the growing congregation.

It is based on the novel of the same name by Juko Nishimura. Plot Morioka, a prosecutor in Tokyo, is accused of theft by a woman and again by a man. The stolen items are found at his house, much to his bewilderment, and he flees out the bathroom window. Morioka's superior revokes his position as prosecutor and calls out a manhunt on him, assigning detective Yamura (from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department) to the case. Morioka tracks one of his accusers to Makami Village in the Noto Peninsula in Ishikawa Prefecture but finds her dead. Among her items he finds a wedding photo of her and the other accuser. After Morioka has left, the police later arrive and find the body, tracking her husband Yokomichi Keiji back to a town called Kounogi in Hokkaido, where they set up an ambush. Morioka soon arrives but manages to escape the chasing police. While moving through the woods, Morioka notices and disarms a tripwire hooked to a shotgun then uses it to scare off a bear attacking a woman who is stuck up a tree. The bear chases Morioka off a cliff and into a river. The woman, Mayumi, rescues him and nurses him back to health at her family home. Morioka states that his name is Maeda but Mayumi's father Tonami Yohinori, who wants to run for governor, recognizes him as Morioka and offers to help. Tonami's assistant Nakayama calls the police in an attempt to help Tonami's political ambitions and Morioka flees the house. Mayumi follows him on horseback and helps him escape, confessing what she has done to Yamura when the police arrive at her house. Yamura follows her to a seaside shanty where Morioka is hiding and forces them back toward her house at gunpoint. While walking they are attacked by a bear and Yamura is clawed. Morioka helps the injured Yamura back to the hideout and cauterizes the wound with a burning branch. Yamura asserts that he will still arrest Morioka despite this but Morioka easily overpowers the weakened Yamura and escapes with Mayumi to a cave hideout. Mayumi's father finds them there and offers his private plane to Morioka so that he can hurry to Tokyo to find Yokomichi. Tonami then withdraws from the race for governor and sends Mayumi to Tokyo under the guise of concluding a business deal for him. Morioka crash lands on a beach near Mito, sneaks past police roadblocks on a truck, and makes his way through the woods to Tokyo. He falls ill and is helped by an unknown woman who recognizes him from the wanted posters. The next night Morioka is spotted by police in Tokyo and chased through the crowded streets before being rescued by Mayumi on horseback leading a pack of horses that crashes through a shield wall set up by the police. The next day Yamura arrives at Mayumi's hotel and shows Morioka a copy of Yokomichi's medical record from a mental hospital where he is being treated for paranoid schizophrenia under the name Suzuki Takeshi. He states that the hospital is operated by the Nagaoka Company owned by Representative Nagaoka Ryosuke. Representative Ryosuke was speaking with Representative Asakura before Asakura suddenly jumped out a window in an alleged suicide, an explanation that Morioka always doubted. The day before Asakura died, a large amount of money was extorted from him by the Tonan company, a company that also purchased guinea pigs from Yokomichi Keiji. Morioka and Mayumi escape from the hotel before police can arrive. Yamura's superior reprimands him and reminds him of the five-year prison sentence that is mandatory for making deals with suspects. Morioki and Mayumi drive to the mental hospital, where they pretend that Morioki is her husband and have him committed. The doctor, Vice President Sakai, recognizes Morioki and taunts him by showing him Yokomichi, who has been rendered incoherent by a strong sedative. Sakai force feeds the same sedative to Morioka and imprisons him in the mental hospital as a schizophrenic under the name Tsuyama and refuses to release him to Mayumi. Morioka intentionally spills some of the pills given to him so that he can pocket them. He slips a pill into Mayumi's hand when she visits and she takes it to Yamura. Representative Ryosuke visits the hospital and is given a demonstration of the effects of the sedative known as \\"AX\\" that blocks parts of the brain responsible for will and makes those who take it obedient to commands. The doctor demonstrates this by commanding a patient to stab himself in the arm, which the patient does. The patient formerly headed the protests against Ryosuke's company but the new drug will be used as a means to get rid of people like him. Morioka, who has been vomiting up the pills after swallowing them, is instructed to write a suicide note then taken to a roof and instructed to jump. Morioka walks to the edge of the roof but instead of jumping he explains that he now understands that Asakura was convinced to jump after being given drugs by Nagaoka. The orderlies attempt to strangle Morioka as Yamura and Hosoi arrive. Sakai runs from Yamura and commits suicide by jumping off the roof and Ryosuke's assistant Doto is found dead as a result of suicide as well. Morioka, Yamura, and Hosoi catch Ryosuke preparing to fly to South Korea with a briefcase full of dollars and Morioka explains that they know Asakura was blackmailing Ryosuke about the drug \\"AX\\". He continues that Ryosuke knew that he did not believe it was a suicide and therefore sent the Yokomichis to stop him. Morioka also recognizes Ryosuke's assistants as the men who killed Mrs. Yokomichi and later shot at him in Hokkaido. Yamura orders Hosoi to arrest Ryosuke's men and Ryosuke tells his men that he will get them out of jail the next day. Ryosuke attempts to leave for his flight but Yamura pulls out his gun and commands Ryosuke to jump out the window but Ryosuke fights back so Morioka and Yamura both shoot him and call it self-defense. The General Prosecutor accepts this explanation but states that Morioka will still have to face prosecution for some of his actions. Morioka explains that he now believes that some criminals cannot be battled with the law along and that he no longer wishes to be prosecutor. Yamura says that when he comes to arrest Morioka he will give him another chance to escape. Morioka leaves and meets Mayumi, explaining that they will have to live on the run. She accepts this and says that she will stay on the run with him.

It is involved in the control of blood sugar level by enhancing insulin secretion. In humans it is synthesised by the gene GLP1R, which is present on chromosome 6. It is a member of the glucagon receptor family of G protein-coupled receptors. GLP1R is composed of two domains, one extracellular (ECD) that binds the C-terminal helix of GLP-1, and one transmembrane (TMD) domain that binds the N-terminal region of GLP-1. In the TMD domain there is a fulcrum of polar residues that regulates the biased signaling of the receptor while the transmembrane helical boundaries and extracellular surface are a trigger for biased agonism. Human receptor ligands GLP1R binds glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1) and glucagon as its natural endogenous agonists. Receptor agonists: *GLP-1 - endogenous in humans *glucagon - endogenous in humans *Oxyntomodulin *exendin-4, *exenatide *lixisenatide *albiglutide *beinaglutide *dulaglutide *efpeglenatide *langlenatide *liraglutide *semaglutide *Taspoglutide *Pegapamodutide Receptor antagonists: *[9-39]-GLP-1 *\\"T-0632\\" *\\"GLP1R0017\\" Receptor positive allosteric modulators: *\\"BETP\\" Receptor negative allosteric modulators: * \\"HTL26119\\" Function and therapeutic potential GLP1R is known to be expressed in pancreatic beta cells. Activated GLP1R stimulates the adenylyl cyclase pathway which results in increased insulin synthesis and release of insulin. Consequently, GLP1R has been a target for developing drugs usually referred to as GLP1R agonists to treat diabetes mellitus. Exendin-4 is one of the peptides used therapeutically to treat diabetes, and its biological binding mode to the GLP-1R has been demonstrated using genetically engineered amino acids. GLP1R is also expressed in the brain where it is involved in the control of appetite. Furthermore, mice that over express GLP1R display improved memory and learning. Stretch responsive vagal neurons in the stomach and intestines also express GLP1R. GLP1R neurons particularly and densely innervate stomach muscle and can communicate with additional organ systems changing breathing and heart rate due to activation. =Huntington's disease= The diabetic, pancreatic, and neuroprotection implications of GLP1R are also thought to be potential therapies for treating the diabetes and energy metabolism abnormalities associated with Huntington's disease affecting the brain and periphery. Exendin-4, an FDA-approved antidiabetic glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, has been tested in mice with the mutated human huntingtin protein showing neurodegenerative changes, motor dysfunction, poor energy metabolism, and high blood glucose levels. Exendin-4 (Ex-4) treatment reduced the accumulation of mutated human huntingtin protein aggregates, improved motor function, extended the survival time, improved glucose regulation, and decreased brain and pancreas pathology. Exendin-4 increases beta cell mass in the pancreatic islets to improve the release of insulin to ultimately increase glucose uptake. The mechanism regarding this insulin increase involves Ex-4 and GLP-1. When the islets in the pancreas are exposed to GLP-1, there is an increased expression of the anti-apoptotic gene bcl-2 and decreased expression of pro-apoptotic genes bax and caspase-3, which leads to greater cell survival. GLP-1 binding to its G protein-coupled receptor activates various different pathways including the growth factor receptor and is coupled to pathways stimulating mitogenesis. Some of these pathways include Rap, Erk1/2, MAPK, B-RAF, PI3-K, cAMP, PKA, and TORC2 that are activated to initiate exocytosis, proinsulin gene expression and translation, increase insulin biosynthesis, and genetically increase beta cell proliferation and neogenesis. The GLP-1R is a G protein-coupled receptor that is dependent on glucose and GLP-1 is a peptide hormone that acts directly on the beta cell to stimulate insulin secretion by activating signal transduction when glucose is present. When glucose is not present, this receptor no longer couples to stimulate insulin secretion in order to prevent hypoglycemia. Relating glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity back to Huntington's disease, increased insulin release and beta cell proliferation by a GLP-1 agonist, Ex-4, helps combat the damage done by mutant htt in peripheral tissues. Htt aggregation decreases beta cell mass and thus impairs insulin release and increases blood glucose levels. Disruption of glycemic homeostasis then affects nutrient availability to neurons and alters neuron function contributing to neurodegeneration and motor problems seen in Huntington's disease. The health of the nervous system is related to metabolic health, thus a diabetes medication as a Huntington's disease treatment is a potential treatment. Ex-4 easily crosses the blood-brain barrier and GLP-1 and Ex-4 have been shown to act on neurons in the brain by exerting neuroprotective actions. In studies with Huntington's disease mice, daily treatments of Ex-4 significantly reduced glucose levels compared to those mice treated with saline. It also increased insulin sensitivity by about 50%, improved insulin- stimulated glucose uptake, and protect pancreatic beta cell function. Huntington's disease has also been linked to imbalances in leptin and ghrelin levels. Ex-4 restored ghrelin levels and also lowered leptin levels allowing Huntington's disease mice to eat more and counteract symptomatic weight loss. This treatment restored beta cell cells and islet structure, reduce mutated human huntingtin aggregates in the brain and pancreas, and also improve motor function seen by the increased activity level of the mice. Improvements were found in the areas of the body that expressed GLP-1R. In addition to its other effects on the Huntington's disease mouse model, daily treatment of Ex-4, the GLP-1R agonist, significantly delayed the onset of mortality and extended the lifespan by approximately one month.

Force-placed insurance controversy  Maintaining a property insurance policy is one of the most common conditions imposed upon anyone who borrows money to purchase a house. If a borrower allows such a policy to lapse, US lenders will purchase force-placed insurance for the property owner (also called lender-placed insurance, or collateral protection insurance) The use of force-placed insurance by lenders is an ongoing practice that, in the wake of the financial crisis, has become increasingly common, being cited by many experts as the cause of foreclosures themselves. The coverage prevents gaps in insurance, which is required by the terms of most mortgages. The financial industry justifies higher premium costs of force-placed insurance policies because of the heightened insurance risk of borrowers who aren‚Äôt paying for their own insurance. Opponents of the product consistently provide statistics in opposition to these statements, citing kickback payouts and loss ratios that are much lower than the rest of the insurance industry.citing kickback payouts and loss ratios that are much lower than the rest of the insurance industry Force-placed insurance policies fell under regulatory scrutiny when the New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) launched an investigation into the lender-placed insurance industry that has so far led to settlements with QBE and Assurant Although testimony in these hearings discussed \\"reverse competition\\" and kickbacks from Assurant to its banking clients, In response to the settlement, DFS Superintendent Benjamin Lawsky stated, \\"Prices should not be pushing up and up, pushing borrowers over the foreclosure cliff.\\" In January 2013, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued new mortgage servicing rules that ensures borrowers are warned in advance of force-placed insurance's cost and prevent banks from force- placing policies on many escrowed loans. ‚ÄúAll consumers will receive protections before a servicer may impose a charge for a force-placed insurance,‚Äù an agency spokeswoman wrote. In October 2012, QBE and California agreed to a rate reduction for lender-placed insurance, with an average savings to policyholders of $577 annually. The Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the federal home loan banks, has looked into the relationships between force-placed insurers and their clients, determining the relationships to be fraudulent and banning any future service kickbacks. In addition, the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation is looking into the practice.

It was the Asian version of the US Turner Classic Movies and aired in the Indian Subcontinent, Southeast Asia and Middle East. After 24 years of operation, the channel was shut down on 2 January 2019. History The channel normally launched as TNT in October 1994, it was time shared with Cartoon Network, and aired from 21:00 CET to 6:00 CET (from 20:00 UTC to 5:00 UTC) and IST respectively and Cartoon Network the remaining time, mainly for analogue cable systems across Europe and India, although it was originally targeted at the Republic of Ireland, India and the United Kingdom. It was formerly free-to-air, but is now carried encrypted and provided only to cable companies and on some commercial satellite systems. It was one of the three movie channels available on Foxtel, and Austar in Australia. Turner Classic Movies and Cartoon Network became two separate channels operating in Europe and the Indian subcontinent in 1999. On 3 April 2000, TNT was relaunched as an Asian version of Turner Classic Movies. In Malaysia, the channel was available on Mega TV (Malaysia) until 1 October 2001. The channel has been discontinued on Mega TV (Malaysia) from 1 October 2001. In India, this channel was exclusively available on Dish TV until 15 March 2009. Now it is available on IN Digital Cable from the Hinduja Group and from 31 August 2009, on Tata Sky. The channel has been discontinued on Tata Sky from 15 September 2012. From 1 July 2011, TCM's Australian and New Zealand feed began broadcasting in 16:9 widescreen. From 12 June 2012, TCM's Asian feed began broadcasting in 16:9 widescreen. From 13 December 2016, Australian satellite and cable provider Foxtel ceased to offer TCM. It is believed the cause of the removal was due to the channel's repeated broadcasting of a limited catalogue of films. Ultimately, this saw TCM no longer available in Australia. Foxtel has since been criticised by its customers for its decision. In December 2017 Starhub in Singapore unilaterally announced they were removing Turner Classic Movies from their channel line up at the end of the year, Meanwhile, Turner Classic Movies was only available on Singtel TV. On 30 November 2018, Sky Network Television in New Zealand replaced the channel with their own version called Sky Movies Vintage. On 31 December 2018, Filipino cable provider SkyCable and Singaporean cable provider Singtel ceased to provide the channel. The channel ceased broadcasting on 2 January 2019, after which the channel space created in 1994 by TNT ceased to exist.

It is named after Otto Folin, VintilƒÉ Cioc√¢lteu, and Willey Glover Denis. Absorbance of different concentrations of tyrosine reacted with Folin-Ciocalteu's reagent are detected at 660 nm The reagent does not measure only phenols, but will react with any reducing substance. It therefore measures the total reducing capacity of a sample, not just phenolic compounds. This reagent is part of the Lowry protein assay, and will also react with some nitrogen-containing compounds such as hydroxylamine and guanidine. The reagent has also been shown to be reactive towards thiols, many vitamins, the nucleotide base guanine, the trioses glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone, and some inorganic ions. Copper complexation increases the reactivity of phenols towards this reagent. This reagent is distinct from Folin's reagent, which is used to detect amines and sulfur-containing compounds. A 1951 paper entitled \\"Protein measurement with the Folin phenol reagent\\" was the most cited paper in the 1945‚Äì1988 Science Citation Index, with 187,652 citations. Physiologic significance Because it measures anti-oxidant capacity in vitro, the reagent has been used to assay foods and supplements in food science. The oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) used to be the industry standard for antioxidant strength of whole foods, juices and food additives. Earlier measurements and ratings by the United States Department of Agriculture were withdrawn in 2012 as biologically irrelevant to human health, referring to an absence of physiological evidence for polyphenols having antioxidant properties in vivo. Consequently, the ORAC method, derived only from in vitro experiments, is no longer considered relevant to human diets or biology. The Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity assay - also based on the presence of polyphenols - is an alternative in vitro measurements of antioxidant capacity.

In 2005 she completed an MFA in Sculpture at the University of Texas at Austin and also received the Joan Mitchell Foundation MFA Grant in New York. Richardson has presented her sculpture in numerous exhibitions throughout Canada, the United States and Taiwan. Her large-scale installation Red State was featured in the Supernovas group show at the Winnipeg Art Gallery and at the Michael Gibson Gallery in London, Ontario. Her solo exhibitions include a presentation of Inter-glacial Free Trade Agency.ca at Regina's Dunlop Art Gallery in 2007 and a series of new works at Harcourt House in Edmonton in 2008.

She has taught sculpture at the University of Manitoba School of Art and courses at the University of Texas. In 2007, she was artist-in-residence at the Bemis Center for Contemporary Art in Omaha, Nebraska. Reception Critic Peter Goddard described Richardson's Inter-Glacial Free Trade Agency.ca as giving the message \\"Any bleak future can look terrific if it just has the right design.\\" In Goddard's view, Richardson is creating a \\"brave new northland\\" (of Canada), where a \\"wonderfully deadpan installation\\" gentrifies the oil rigs in the tundra; where protective suits \\"come in zippy matching colours\\" and even the reindeer are glammed-up. Art critic Amy Karlinsky, writing in BorderCrossings, opined that Richardson's \\"minimal and collapsible\\" Red State \\"hinted at her capacity to generate metaphor\\": its \\"monumentality\\" was \\"all sham and seductive illusion - a tidy reference to both art and politics\\". And Karlinsky had earlier enjoyed \\"Richardson's fabulous and funny kinetic sculptures of 2002\\", which in her view \\"invited viewer participation and provided wry commentary on Canadian icons and symbolism\\". But Karlinsky found Inter-Glacial Free Trade Agency.ca \\"more fraught\\" by contrast, and agreed with the exhibition curator that Richardson's environmental concerns were integral to her works and had \\"catalyzed\\" her into production.

The team was founded by the Hopkins Brothers sporting goods stores. One day, however, the team's manager absconded with the daily gate proceeds. J. L.

The team was based out of Kansas City and Des Moines. 1914 All Nations Team Under the management of Wilkinson, the All Nations' approach to the game was more serious than that of many teams who followed Abe Saperstein's farcical approach. They did however provide additional entertainment for their audiences, including having a dance band to play before the games and wrestlers like Ben Reeves to perform after their games.\\"Pitcher Fans 21 Jacksons\\" Superior Tribune, Superior, Wisconsin, June 17, 1912, Page 9, Column 5 Wilkinson transported the team from location to location in a $25,000 Pullman car, which also held portable bleachers which would be set up for the game.

It went 3-1 against the Indianapolis ABC's in 1916 and splitting a series with the Chicago American Giants. The team encountered difficulties during World War I, when it found most of its better players were drafted, and was finally disbanded in 1918.

Biography Bistolfi was born in Casale Monferrato in Piedmont, north-west Italy, to Giovanni Bistolfi, a sculptor in wood, and to Angela Amisano. In 1876 he enrolled in the Brera Art Academy in Milan, where his teacher was Giosu√® Argenti. In 1880 he studied under Odoardo Tabacchi at the Accademia Albertina in Turin. Work Bronze crucifix by Leonardo Bistolfi in the Mausoleum in the Vittoriale degli Italiani on Lake Garda. His first works (Le lavandaie (‚ÄòThe Washerwomen‚Äô), Tramonto (‚ÄòSunset‚Äô), Vespero (‚ÄòEvening‚Äô), Boaro (‚ÄòCattle-hand‚Äô), Gli amanti (‚ÄòThe Lovers‚Äô)), executed between 1880 and 1885, show the influence of the Milanese Scapigliatura. In 1882 he sculpted L'Angelo della morte (‚ÄòThe Angel of Death‚Äô) for the Brayda tomb in the Turin cemetery known as the Cimitero Monumentale, and in 1883 he produced a bust of the painter Antonio Fontanesi for the Accademia Albertina: these works show a turn towards Symbolism which the artist was never to abandon. From this time until 1914 Bistolfi produced many busts, medals and portraits of prominent figures including the Piedmontese painter Lorenzo Delleani, the kings of Italy Vittorio Emanuele II and Umberto I, the criminologist Cesare Lombroso, the writer Edmondo De Amicis, and the publisher and journalist Emilio Treves. In the early 1890s he was made an honorary member of the Accademia Albertina and became secretary of the Circolo degli Artisti (‚ÄòArtists‚Äô Circle‚Äô). In 1892 he began a two-year task of decorating Chapel XVI of the Sacro Monte di Crea, one of the Sacri Monti of Piedmont and Lombardy which are recognised as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. In 1893 he married Maria Gusberti. Also during the years 1892‚Äì1908 Bistolfi executed numerous funerary monuments (statues and reliefs), including the memorial plaque for Andr√© Gladis. In 1902, along with Davide Calandra, Giorgio Ceragioli, Enrico Reycend and Enrico Thovez, he founded the magazine L'arte decorativa moderna (‚ÄòModern Decorative Art‚Äô). Between 1895 and 1905 he displayed works at a number of Venice Biennale exhibitions. In 1906 he produced a monument to the painter Giovanni Segantini La bellezza liberata dalla materia (‚ÄòBeauty liberated from matter‚Äô) known also as L'alpe (‚Äòthe Alp‚Äô), which is conserved at the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna in Rome. For the Monument of Vittorio Emanuele II in Rome Bistolfi produced the marble group Il sacrificio (‚ÄòSacrifice‚Äô). In 1923 he was made a Senatore del Regno (Senator of the Kingdom). In 1928 Bistolfi produced the Monumento ai Caduti (war memorial) for Casale Monferrato. Bistolfi died at La Loggia, in the province of Turin, on 2 September 1933. He was interred in the cemetery of Casale Monferrato. His work is exhibited at La Loggia, at the Mus√©e d'Orsay in Paris, at The National Museum of Western Art in Tokyo, and at the Galleria d'Arte Moderna in Turin. The largest collection, however is at the Gipsoteca ‚ÄúLeonardo Bistolfi‚Äù in Casale Monferrato, where more than 170 of his works are on display in five rooms. These include drawings and sketches as well as works and bozzetti in terracotta, plasticine, and gesso and some sculptures in marble and bronze. Sculpture by Bistolfi is also to be found in the Cimitero monumentale di Staglieno of Genoa, a town where his influence was seen in the work of a number of sculptors, particularly those specializing in funerary art.

Currently, EULs are used by the Department of Defense and the Veterans Administration. Temporary authority has also been granted to the General Services Agency and the National Aeronatics and Space Administration. EUL authority is derived from Congress and is specific to each agency (e.g. 10 USC 2667 for the DoD). The information below is specific to DoD EULs. Granted a ground lease (the term may vary by agency or project), the developer is able to make improvements to the property which can be leased at market rents to any interested tenants. Under EUL, the U.S. government retains control over the leased property, the EUL developer (lessee) retains a lease interest only. Since the agency can issue enhanced use leases only on land that is unneeded, the improvements must not be directly tied to any programmatic requirements of the installation. The advantages to the developer include prime secure convenient locations on military installations, and the opportunity to provide sole-source services and products in lieu of rent for the ground lease. The advantages to the federal agency include the possibility of fast-tracking alterations, repairs or new construction so that the improved space becomes available for lease. In-kind considerations or cash to no less than the fair market value of the property is provided in return by the developer. The enhanced use lease is becoming a very popular tool to accommodate realignment of military functions under Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC). Military installations are legally bound, but not necessarily funded, to accommodate BRAC-mandated realignments of functions. The use of EULs has mushroomed with the expanded authority of Title 10 USC, Section 2667, of the National Defense Authorization Act. It remains to be seen whether this form of privatization will create increased financial, security or environmental risks. Legal complications that have emerged include how EUL-encumbered property will be treated when an installation is targeted for closure under BRAC (example, Building 40 at Walter Reed).

History Logo of FV Motor Eberswalde until May 2011. The club was founded on 1 July 1909 as FC Preussen Eberswalde (FC Prussia Eberswalde) and steadily improved in the period leading up to World War I advancing to play in the top local league. The club nearly collapsed during the war but resumed play in 1920 and soon returned to its previous good form going through the 1922‚Äì23 season with only a single loss and advancing to the country's second highest play class. After the rise to power of the Nazis in 1933 German football was re-structured and Prussia kept its place playing in the second tier Oberliga. In 1936 the team slipped back to local city league competition and after the outbreak of World War II played progressively fewer games. In 1943‚Äì44 Prussia briefly partnered with longtime local rival Eberswalde SV 1912 (originally FC Britannia) as a combined wartime side or Kriegspielgemainschaft. At war's end occupying Allied authorities banned most organizations in Germany including sports and football clubs. The two wartime partners emerged in 1946 as ZSG (Zentralen Sportgemeinschaft) Eberswalde-Nord and ZSG Eberswalde-S√ºd, respectively. Eberswald was located in the Soviet zone of occupation which would soon become East Germany and football leagues separate from those in the western half of the country would emerge. As was common in the east, the club would undergo a number of name changes playing first in 1948 as ZSG Eintracht Eberswalde, as BSG (Betriebssportgemeinschaft) Stahl Eberswalde in 1950 and finally as BSG Motor Eberswalde beginning in 1952. A re-organization of the league structure that year meant that the club would no longer have to regularly face strong teams from Potsdam and Lausitz in their division and they capitalized by taking district titles in 1955 and 1956. They were not able, however, to make it through the subsequent playoff rounds into the second division DDR-Liga. That failure dogged the club in five more attempts at promotion up to 1970 until they finally won promotion in 1972. Over the next decade Eberswalde found themselves in the position of being able to easily dominate the third division Bezirksliga Frankfurt/Oder, but not being good enough to stay up for any length of time in the DDR-Liga (II). After slipping again to third division play in 1984 they would win division titles in five of the next six seasons, but failed to make it through the promotion rounds back to second-tier competition until after German reunification in 1990. BSG changed its name to SV Motor Eberswalde and in 1995 the football section became independent as FV Motor Eberswalde. After the merger of the football leagues of the two Germany's Eberswalde took up play in the Amateur Oberliga Nordost-Nord (III) where they spent two seasons before being relegated to the fourth division. The club played in the Oberliga Nordost-Nord (IV) and in the last dozen years has typically earned lower table results, before being relegated to the Verbandsliga Brandenburg in 2007. On 10 June 2011 Motor merged with FC Freya Marienwerder and changed name to FV Preussen Eberswalde after a 24 May 2011 meeting; members of the merged clubs decided for approval.

It is the first lesbian paperback novel, and the beginning of the lesbian pulp fiction genre; it also addresses issues of conformity in 1950s American society. The novel tells the story of Susan \\"Mitch\\" Mitchell, an awkward, lonely freshman at a Midwestern college who falls in love with Leda, her popular but troubled sorority sister. Published by Gold Medal Books, Spring Fire sold 1.5 million copies through at least three printings. Cleis Press re-released the book in 2004 after extensive negotiations with Meaker, who had long denied permission over her feelings about the ending. Following the exposure of their relationship, Leda is committed to a mental institution and Mitch realizes she never loved Leda. Meaker later wrote, \\"I still cringe when I think about it. I never wanted it republished. It was too embarrassing.\\" Meaker explained in the 2004 foreword that Dick Carroll, her editor at Gold Medal Books, told her that because the book would be sent through the mail, no references to homosexuality as an attractive life could be portrayed or postal inspectors would send it back to the publishing house. He said that one character must acknowledge that she is not a lesbian, and the other she's involved with \\"must be sick or crazy\\".Packer, Vin. Spring Fire, Introduction. 2004, Cleis Press. Background The story is based on an affair Meaker had in boarding school as a teenager. She was awkward and shy in a new school and fell in love with a more experienced, older girl. They traded love letters, and the other girl's mother found them on the eve of a weekend trip they were to take together. When the girl's mother approached her, \\"She said she'd rather kill herself than be like me,\\" Meaker remembered.Luksic, Nikola. \\"Authors look back at the heyday of lesbian pulp.\\" In Xtra! Toronto: August 4, 2005. She initially wished to title the book Sorority Girl, but her business-minded editor changed the title to Spring Fire in order to confuse potential readers with the James A Michener title The Fires of Spring. Plot summary Susan (\\"Mitch\\") Mitchell is pledging to the Tri Epsilon sorority at fictional Cranston University. She is seen as a boon to the sorority due to her father's significant wealth, and the sorority is promised a new silverware set from the alumni if she is accepted. Large, ungainly, and shy, she is drawn to older sorority member Leda Taylor who is direct and independent; they become roommates and have double dates‚ÄîLeda with boyfriend Jake and Mitch with the sullen, boorish president of the \\"Sig Eps\\" who humiliates her during a fraternity party. Mitch flees the party after striking the fraternity president on the head and the sorority is blackballed. Much-more-experienced Leda trades her exasperation with Mitch's innocence with overt affection for her in rapid mood switches. To avoid further exclusion, Mitch is persuaded by her sorority to invite the fraternity president to a dance at the sorority house, where he rapes her after getting her drunk. Afterwards Leda finds her stunned and calms her down by telling her how much she loves her. They begin a secret affair while Leda publicly continues dating Jake, whom she tells Mitch she rather despises, and Mitch going with relatively harmless \\"independents\\" (non-fraternity boys), which is frowned-on by the sorority leaders. Mitch's only friend in the pledge class is kicked out of the sorority after getting home at 1 AM because her date had a flat tire. Leda tries to teach Mitch that they must put men first so they aren't disrespected, but they may love each other in private. Leda's promiscuous, alcoholic young mother visits, and Leda tries to test Mitch so she's able to answer her mother's questions about men, but Mitch is shy and reluctant to lie about her feelings. But after her mother leaves, Leda apologizes for ignoring Mitch, shows her affection again, and tries to reassure her that they aren't lesbians. Mitch tries to sleep with her date to see if he makes her feel the way Leda does, but he is unable to perform. Convinced that she is abnormal and infectious and that Leda is a temptation, Mitch writes to Leda telling her she's leaving the sorority. Leda tries to stop her by seducing her again, but their sorority sisters enter the room and see what is happening. In an emergency meeting, Leda reads the sisters Mitch's heartfelt letter and explains that Mitch has had a crush on her and the sisters had seen Mitch attacking Leda. While the Dean of Women interrogates Mitch, Leda gets drunk and wallows in her guilt for selling Mitch out to the sorority. When the Dean asks to see Leda, sorority members find her sobering up, but she is still not sober enough to drive and she crashes the car; in the aftermath, witnesses hear her calling out deliriously for Mitch. Her injuries are serious enough that she is hospitalized for 3 days, during which Mitch moves out of the sorority house and back into the dorm. They meet a final time when the Dean drives Mitch to visit Leda in the hospital; the tenuous confrontation leaves Leda laughing and crying simultaneously as Mitch departs. The day the sorority's new silverware set arrives, they learn that Leda has had a complete nervous breakdown and is to be institutionalized. Mitch begins new friendships as she realizes that she never really loved Leda after all. Impact Released as a pulp fiction novel solely because of its content, Spring Fire was sold in train and bus station kiosks and drug stores with other sensationalist books about crime, drugs, gangsters, and cowboys. Although it was not reviewed by any renowned literary critiques, Spring Fire sold more copies in 1952 than The Postman Always Rings Twice by James M. Cain and My Cousin Rachel by Daphne du Maurier, also released the same year. When the paper in pulp novels was not designed to last more than a year, Spring Fire went through three printings, eventually selling nearly 1.5 million copies. Its success earned Meaker an invitation to meet Roger Fawcett, the owner of Gold Medal Books' parent company, who wanted to, \\"shake the hand of the writer who outsold God's Little Acre (Erskine Caldwell).\\"Server, Lee. \\"Vin Packer.\\" Encyclopedia of Pulp Fiction Writers: The Essential Guide to More than 200 Pulp Pioneers and Mass-Market Masters; Checkmark Books, 2002. Spring Fire inspired other serious writers in the lesbian pulp fiction genre such as Ann Bannon and Valerie Taylor, and indeed, proved so profitable that the genre attracted (usually male) writers whose books exploited the topic of lesbianism. In short, it launched an entire genre of fiction. In 1989, Meaker spoke about realizing the impact the book had while she was working at Gold Medal Books: \\"Spring Fire was not aimed at any lesbian market, because there wasn‚Äôt any that we knew about. I was just out of college. We were amazed, floored, by the mail that poured in. That was the first time anyone was aware of the gay audience out there.\\"Keller, Yvonne. \\"Was it Right to Love Her Brother's Wife So Passionately? Lesbian Pulp Novels and U.S. Lesbian Identity, 1950‚Äì1965.\\" American Quarterly, 2005. In 2004 upon the re-release of the Cleis Press edition, a reviewer noted, \\"Spring Fire not only plays a vital pioneering role in lesbian writing, it‚Äôs also as a warning of how difficult things could be. It‚Äôs ironic that Spring Fire was released now, when we need it the most, to remind us of the incredible courage of those who came before, the enormity of what has been accomplished, and why we must remain vigil, and treasure and protect every step forward we‚Äôve managed to take.\\"Parks, Joy. \\"The Book That Sparked the Fire.\\" In Sacred Ground: News and Reviews on Lesbian Writing.

He persuaded the Bemba, feared by the Europeans colonizers and by neighbouring tribes, to allow him to become the first missionary into their territory around Kasama. At the time the British South Africa Company (BSAC) chartered by Britain to administer North-Eastern Rhodesia was not in control of all the territory.Website of the Catholic Diocese of Mpika: \\"Brief history of the Catholic Church in Zambia.\\" Accessed 25 March 2007. Origins Dupont was born in Maine et Loire, on 23 July 1850 to a peasant family. After a short and quite successful military service, he died to become a member of the White Fathers missionary society, now called the Society of the Missionaries of Africa. He was ordained a priest on 21 December 1878, and took his oath as a member of the White Fathers the following year. He was then sent to teach at the College of Saint-Louis of Carthage at Thibar in the French protectorate of Tunisia, now in the B√©ja Governorate. He was later sent to the Karema Mission on Lake Tanganyika in 1892.Dictionary of African Christian Biography website\\" \\"Dupont, Joseph\\". Accessed 15 March 2007.] Early years in Africa The White Fathers had arrived at Mponda, west of Lake Nyasa, in 18850, and in 18910 had moved up the Stevenson Road which had been built to connect Nyasa with Lake Tanganyika, stopping at Mambwe Mwela. They attempted to set up in Bemba lands but the Paramount Chief of the Bemba, the Chitimukulu, was fiercely opposed to any incursion by missionaries. When Dupont arrived at Mambwe in 1895 he found that some of the independently minded Bemba Senior Chiefs were not opposed, and one of them, Makasa at Kayambi, gave Dupont a foothold in his area in 1895. Dupont tried to expand into the Bemba heartland and though gaining favour from many of the chiefs, was still opposed by the Chitimukulu. A story goes that one day the Chitimukulu (VII Sampa Kapalakasha) sent two warriors armed with bows and arrows to kill Dupont, and they hid to ambush him where he used to shoot guinea fowl. Suddenly a bird burst from the bush and Dupont hit it with a single shot and it landed almost on the head of one of the warriors. This put them in such awe of his power that they stayed hidden and did nothing.Great North Road website . Related by Heather Chalcraft, publisher of Zambia Lowdown magazine, December 09, 2002. Accessed 25 March 2007. In 1897 Dupont was appointed the first Vicar Apostolic of Nyassa, which covered today's Malawi and the whole northern half of present-day Zambia. He was consecrated the Titular bishop of Thibaris on 15 August 1897 by Bishop Adolphe Le Chaptois, M. Afr. There are several versions of the origin of the nickname 'Moto Moto' (fire fire). One is that it was in recognition of his energy, another that Dupont smoked a pipe and was constantly calling for a light, another was that it was a Chewa war cry from the Nyasa area, another, more unlikely, that he had an early kind of motorbike. The Chieftainship succession crisis In 1896 Chitimukulu VII Sampa Kapalakasha died and the title remained vacant while the succession was worked out. Dupont tried to get permission from the most powerful Senior Chief, Mwamba III at Milungu, to expand the mission but was rejected. However, in 1898 Chief Mwamba fell ill and sent for Dupont, who had some medical skills and a reputation for healing. Before the chief died the next year he and his council were sufficiently impressed by Dupont's help they asked him to succeed as chief.New Advent Catholic Encyclopedia website: \\"Nyassa\\", accessed 26 March 2007 This provoked a crisis because, firstly, the coronation of a new chief required human sacrifice, and, secondly, a Bemba civil war threatened over the succession of the Chitimukulu. At first Dupont, who had become very knowledgeable about Bemba culture and traditions, agreed to act as chief to forestall trouble, joking that he should take on Chief Mwamba's wives. Meanwhile, he gathered support from the 33 subordinate Bemba chiefs for his next action. British control of the Bemba To avoid bloodshed Dupont asked the BSAC administration based in Fort Jameson to take control of the Bemba lands. On 3 November 1898 the BSAC sent Charles MacKinnon and R.A. 'Bobo' Young from Mbala with a force which did the job and paved the way for a new Chitimukulu and Chief Mwamba to be installed and eventually led to a BSAC boma being based in Kasama.Carmody, Brendan: \\"The politics of Catholic education in Zambia: 1891‚Äì1964\\".

Despite the fact that this must have been one of the few occasions in history when a Frenchman pushed a territory into the British Empire,Origin of this remark uncertain ‚Äî possibly Professor David M Gordon or recounted by him. MacKinnon in particular was opposed to Dupont's presence in the country, not only because of the strife which it caused with the Chitimukulu, but also because Protestant missionaries of the London Missionary Society had set up in Mackinnon's district of Mbala and there were some rivalries with the Catholic White Fathers. To Dupont's amazement Mackinnon told him that he had no permission to remain there, according to orders of the new Administrator, Robert Codrington. Dupont protested that it was he who had opened up the Bemba to British control, and he stayed put. Codrington accepted the reality of the situation, and as a gesture of reconciliation and gratitude invited Dupont to sit beside him at the installation of the next chief in 1899.The Northern Rhodesia Journal online at NRZAM.org: W. F. Rea, SJ: \\"Bishop Dupont and the Bemba\\". Vol V, No. 6 (1964) pp 617‚Äì618. This article includes correspondence between Dupont and Codrington refuting the contention by some writers that Dupont actively sought the Mwamba chieftaincy. 1900‚Äì1930 In 1899 Dupont founded the Chilubula Mission enclave, which still stands today near Kayambi. Later he had some quarrels with colleagues who found his discipline too military and who felt he devoted to much attention to the Bemba and not enough to many other groups living in the huge area of the Vicariate. Dupont resigned his office on 28 February 1911 and left for Thibar in Tunisia where the White Fathers had a retirement home, and where he died in 1930 and was buried.

The Club has 38 tennis courts in all four surfaces (clay court, Har-Tru, grass court and hardcourt), a junior Olympic-size swimming pool and other amenities. It is the home of the Forest Hills Stadium, a 14,000 seat outdoor tennis stadium and concert venue. It is most notable for hosting 60 editions of the U.S. National Championships (renamed the US Open Tennis Championships in 1968), first from 1915 to 1920, and then again from 1924 to 1977. In addition, the finals of the Davis Cup were held at the club 10 times, more than any other venue. The US Pro tournament was held at the venue 11 times, and another big professional tournament, the Tournament of Champions, was held at the venue 3 times. The West Side Tennis Club was the venue of the Forest Hills Tennis Classic, a now- defunct WTA Tour Tier IV event, and a men's challenger event. The Open saw some of its biggest moments and changes while at West Side, including the introduction of seedings in 1927, tiebreakers in 1970, equal prize money for men and women in 1973, and night play in 1975. Currently, the stadium is used as an outdoor concert venue. History Entrance Stadium, late 2011 The club was founded in 1892 when 13 original members rented land on Central Park West for three clay courts and a small clubhouse. Ten years later, the land had become too valuable, and the club moved to a site near Columbia University with room for eight courts. In 1908, the club moved again to a property at 238th Street and Broadway. The new site covered two city blocks and had 12 grass courts and 15 clay courts. The club hosted the International Lawn Tennis Challenge (now known as the Davis Cup) in 1911. With crowds in the thousands, the club leadership realized that it would need to expand to a more permanent location. In 1912, a site in Forest Hills, Queens, was purchased. The signature Tudor-style clubhouse was built the next year. In 1915, the United States Lawn Tennis Association National Championship, later renamed the U.S. Open, moved to West Side. By 1923, the success of the event necessitated the construction of a 14,000-seat horseshoe-shaped stadium that still stands today. The stadium's first event was the final of the International Lawn Tennis Challenge, which saw the U.S. defeat Australia. Althea Gibson became the first black player to play in a Grand Slam event in 1950 (in 1957 she became the first black player to win the tournament), and Billie Jean King was the first player to win a Grand Slam event with a metal racket in 1967. In 1968, the year of the first televised broadcast of the US Open, Arthur Ashe became the first black man to win a Grand Slam tournament there. Beginning in 1971 the stadium was home to the annual Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Tennis Tournament which was a celebrity pro-am for charity featuring the likes of Chevy Chase, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carlos Santana, Edward M. Kennedy, Elton John and more throughout the decade. In 1975, the tournament was switched to Har-Tru clay courts. By 1978, the tournament had outgrown West Side, and the USTA moved the tournament to the new USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows under USTA President William Hester's leadership. In 2008, the stadium was the site of a women's satellite tournament. The New York Empire of World TeamTennis announced it would play its home matches, coached by Patrick McEnroe, at the stadium beginning with its inaugural 2016 season. The team relocated to the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center for its second season in 2017.

In addition to hosting the main court for tennis championships, the Forest Hills Stadium has been used as a concert venue featuring artists like Frank Sinatra, The Supremes, Bob Dylan, The Beatles, Judy Garland, Jimi Hendrix, The Who, Donna Summer, Brand New, Arctic Monkeys and Chance the Rapper, and was the location for the Forest Hills Music Festival. Following the 1978 departure of the Open the stadium fell into disrepair, by 2011 it was called a \\"crumbling ruin\\" and was denied landmark status by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. The West Side Tennis Club received an offer in 2010 to raze the stadium and replace it with condominiums. However, in mid-2013, the stadium re-opened as an outdoor concert venue with Mumford & Sons performing the inaugural concert. Since then the Forest Hills Stadium has held a regular summer concert series featuring Santana, Zac Brown Band, D'Angelo, Van Morrison, Arctic Monkeys, and others. It is also the summer home of The New York Pops. The stadium also has a history of use as a filming location. The Alfred Hitchcock film Strangers on a Train (1951) was filmed in part during the 1950 Davis Cup finals at the West Side Tennis Club on August 25‚Äì27, 1950. Several scenes in Wes Anderson's The Royal Tenenbaums were filmed in and around the stadium including the \\"Windswept Fields\\" meltdown of Richie Tenenbaum.

It is the oldest school in the Mount Diablo Unified School District, founded in April 1901.  Academies  The school features several specialized programs, known as \\"academies\\". Originally these were opt- in; a student could join an academy or choose to pursue their education without taking academy classes. Beginning in 2012 all sophomores and freshmen and all incoming students were required to enroll in one of four academies. While this decision was controversial, Mount Diablo High School continues to house all students from grades 9-12 within these four California Partnership Academies, in addition to the World Academy, which serves students who are new to the country and English language education. The academies are: * The Digital Safari Multimedia Academy program, started in 1996, teaches and integrates digital media into a high school core curriculum using project- based learning. * The International Hospitality and Tourism Academy (IHTA) is a campus program which teaches cooking and hospitality. The program includes the student-run restaurant Serendipity, which operates three days a week and is supported by the students' mentors as well as professional chefs and bakers. IHTA also incorporates the Sustainable Hospitality Pathway, which focuses its nutrition and food prep classes on career fields including healthy food service, agri- and eco-tourism, and outdoor recreation. * Academy of Construction & Mechanical Engineering (ACME) * Medical Bio-Technology Academy (MBTA) * The World Academy, serving students who are newcomers to the United States. MDHS also has an active Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC). At one time, it also offered a FAME (Fine Arts, Media, Entertainment) Academy. History Although there were grammar schools in the area throughout the 1890s, the nearest high schools were in Berkeley and Oakland. In 1901, voters established what was then known as the Mt. Diablo Unified School District, and classes were held in various temporary locations for the first two years, including the grammar school on Willow Pass Road and the Odd Fellows hall at the corner of what are now Salvio and Colfax Streets. On 14 February 1903, district trustees voted to construct the first MDHS building, which opened in 1904 and was torn down in 1963. Digital Safari Academy The Digital Safari Academy (DSA) was founded in the autumn of 1996 on a U.S. Department of Education grant to integrate vocational education with the core academic curriculum. The goal was to do this with professional multimedia design tools. Instead of using educational software, they would attempt to make it. Thus, as students who studied earth science, they would create interactive programs about the universe or geology. As they studied English they would create interactive book reports or websites about their favorite poets. As they studied social science, they would develop websites for model e-businesses or a CD-ROM about World War II. Since 1997, the Digital Safari Academy has won two awards in the California Student Media Festival. In the spring of 2001, the academy produced a seven-day webcast of the International Science and Engineering Fair. The Digital Safari Academy, from 2007 through today, offers design services to businesses, non-profits, and other community organizations, through an annual internship program. The DSA's project design methodology has been adapted by numerous programs around the country. A majority of DSA graduates have chosen to continue their education beyond high school, choosing state and community colleges, graphic arts schools, or technical schools. The number of graduates in the multimedia and technical industries is growing, as more former students finish their career training. In 2013 the Digital Safari Academy expanded its course offerings even further to serve a larger student population: freshmen now participate in an Art and Design course that articulates for possible community college credit, and the original 10th-12th grade Multimedia pathway now runs parallel to a new Interactive Design pathway, which focuses on web design, game design, and software application development.

It operates on a pull model, meaning even servers that are not up when a change is made will receive the change once they come back up. As of version 4, ISconf requires no central server, though it does expect all servers to start identically, which is easiest to accomplish using some form of automated install which may require a central server.  Theory  ISconf comes from the \\"InfraStructure administration\\" movement which created and defined most of the OS-side backgrounds (in theory terms) of what is now making up the DevOps sphere. It is based on the idea that the best way to keep servers from diverging is to apply the same set of operations in the same order. This is in contrast to the \\"convergence\\" theory of system automation, which attempts to \\"converge\\" servers to known states from arbitrary states using sets of rules such as \\"if a package outside of this set is installed, uninstall it\\", \\"if package X is not installed, install it\\", or \\"if daemon X is not running, start it\\". According to Steve Traugott, there is no way to guarantee that a given set of rules will actually be able to converge from any given state. ISconf enforces order of operations by assuming only commands issued through it change the state of the system. As a result, if a package or file is installed on a system manually, it will stay there, which may eventually cause problems such as version conflicts. ISconf is targeted at environments where configurations must remain identical. In such environments, it is typical to give only a few systems administrators root access to hosts. This minimizes the risk of manual changes because it is easy to train a small group of people to only make changes through ISconf. ISconf was inspired by, and originally implemented as, Makefiles. However, Makefiles specify dependencies and not a total ordering of operations. ISconf version 1 dealt with this by making each operation dependent on the previous one, but this was tedious and poorly suited to Make. More recent versions of ISconf use a simple append-only journal.  Major Versions  The major version in common use apparently were ISconf2 and ISconf3, while ISconf4 stayed in a very long beta period. It had in fact been finished and put to use in larger environments but due to the delay saw limited community adoption. * ISconf 1 (Makefiles) * ISconf 2 (early 200x?) written by Steve Traugott tried to adhere to the principles of infrastructure administration better. * ISconf 3 (2002) was a rewrite of version 2 by Luke Kanies. (Unknown to what extent he contributed to it) * ISconf 4 was mostly written by the original author, Steve Traugott.  Trivia  Luke Kanies later switched to CFengine2, until finally authored and released Puppet. As a result, one could consider ISconf an ancestor of Puppet, though both CFengine and Puppet implement the \\"convergence\\" model of configuration management, essentially the opposite of the \\"order of operations\\" model implemented by at least ISconf versions 1, 2, and 4.

With a circulation of 18,000 daily and 22,000 Sunday, the morning paper serves southeastern Wisconsin and northeastern Illinois. It was the original and flagship property of United Communications Corporation. The News also prints the free KN Sampler, which is delivered by mail to homes in the city of Kenosha, as well as select zip codes in Lake County, IL. In February 2019, Lee Enterprises purchased the Kenosha News, as well as its sister paper, the Lake Geneva Regional News, from United Communications Corporation.  Early years  The Kenosha Evening News was first published on the afternoon of October 22, 1894. During its first two years of publication, the newspaper had a circulation of fewer than 400 copies. The number of copies sold daily increased to 1,100 at the turn of the 20th century, and to more than 3,000 by 1915. After World War I, daily circulation tripled, to nearly 10,000 in 1925. By 1947, the figure topped 18,000. Today's Kenosha News circulation averages around 22,000 copies. The Kenosha Evening News had been the dream of Frank Haydon Hall, whose ambition was to establish a daily newspaper for the growing community where he had settled a few years before. In those days, it was common for a newspaper to openly support one of the political parties, and the Evening News was no exception. It would be, Hall declared, \\"dedicated to the principles\\" of the then-dominant Republican Party. In August 1891, Hall, who was also a partner in a large Chicago printing firm, purchased Kenosha's half- century-old Telegraph-Courier from Levi Cass. The venerable weekly, which continued as a sister publication to the Evening News, became the springboard for Hall's new daily. The early Evening News was a simple six-column, four- page broadsheet, printed on a cylinder press and folded by hand. Its first subscriber, reportedly, was Johnson A. Jackson, secretary-treasurer of a local factory that manufactured baby furniture. Its second was Eugene R. Head, who, two years later, would own the Evening News. In the earliest days, national and world news was reprinted, mostly from Chicago and Milwaukee papers, with the inevitable delays. In 1898, during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, the News tentatively experimented with a more timely approach. It received a brief daily telegraphed summary of war news from the American Press Association. For the first seven years of Evening News George W. Johnston was city editor, the paper's only reporter and general jack-of-all-trades. He later bought his own newspaper, becoming editor and publisher of the Campbellsport News. In early 1896, Hall decided to sell the Evening News and Telegraph-Courier to Head, a member of one of Kenosha's best known families. Until he purchased the papers, the 30-year-old Head had been associated with his father's lumber business. Head ran the business and wrote editorials, with Johnston continuing to gather and write the local news. In 1897, they were joined by George P. Hewitt of Appleton, Wisconsin. The new partners formed a successful team, with Head managing the business end of things, and Hewitt, a trained newsman, handling the editorial duties. Almost immediately, Head and Hewitt abandoned the old practice of having ‚Äúboilerplate‚Äù pages, non-timely \\"news,\\" feature material, serial novels and the like, printed in Chicago. The Kenosha Evening News became one of the first \\"homeprint\\" newspapers in Wisconsin, with the entire issue printed locally in its downtown plant. Head and Hewitt also built a thriving real estate company. During the partnership‚Äôs first several years, substantial profits from land dealing were plowed back into the newspaper. In 1898, to accommodate advertising demands, the size of the daily was doubled, from four to eight pages. By the end of the nineteenth century, the Evening News was on a solid business footing.  Early 20th century  In 1901, George Hewitt left the Evening News to enter the automobile industry. His interest in the paper was sold to Samuel S. Simmons, a member of another prominent Kenosha family and nephew of local industrial giant Zalmon G. Simmons of the Simmons Bedding Company. Genial Sam Simmons left a position with the Chicago Gas Company to edit his hometown daily newspaper. The new partnership of Eugene Head and Simmons continued until 1913, when they incorporated as the Head- Simmons Publishing Co. When Hewitt left the paper in 1901, so did George Johnston, who was replaced as city editor by Walter T. Marlatt, a Hoosier and the first of a family of newsmen who would be associated with the Evening News for a half century. In 1903, the linotype and a technique called stereotyping, a process for molding semi-circular printing plates for the new rotary press, were introduced. Before the newspaper got its first linotype machine ‚Äì it would add two more in 1913 and, eventually own 13 before they were replaced by computer-generated typesetting in the 1970s ‚Äì all type was hand set. The linotype machine did away with the letter-by-letter, line-by-line manual task, casting entire lines of type in molten metal, 550 degrees hot. The linotype was an automatic, keyboard-operated machine that had been invented about 20 years earlier and still was not in common use. The linotype clicked and clacked, whirred and vibrated. One by one, slugs of lead type were molded, a line at a time, six lines a minute, 360 an hour. A typical operator might set 10,000 words of newspaper copy each work shift. On September 7, 1915, Eugene Head died suddenly at the age of 48. Head had taken the struggling newspaper and built it into one of the most successful dailies in southern Wisconsin in less than 20 years. His death brought a reorganization of Head-Simmons Publishing Co., with Sam Simmons filling the vacant office of publisher. City editor Walter Marlatt became editor. Marlatt had begun his journalism career in 1889 as a cub reporter in Indiana. After newspaper jobs in Indianapolis, Philadelphia, New York and Chicago, he had come to Kenosha in 1896 as headmaster of a private school. He joined the Evening News after a short stint as editor of the weekly Kenosha Daily Union. Ralph S. Kingsley, who started as bookkeeper in 1908 and advanced to assistant business manager, became business manager. Eugene's son, Clarence E. Head, who joined the paper in 1913 and would remain active in its management for nearly 59 years, was named assistant business manager. On March 8, 1917, Simmons died suddenly at age 47. The death of the well-liked publisher caused a major disruption of the business for almost eight months, until Simmons' estate was settled. In October 1917, a new company, the Kenosha News Publishing Co., was organized by Marlatt, Kingsley and Clarence Head. It purchased the entire holdings of the Head-Simmons Publishing Co., and took over the newspaper and the large printing establishment. Marlatt became president, Head became vice president and assistant business manager and Kingsley served as secretary-treasurer and business manager. Marlatt was an energetic and enlightened progressive, actively promoting a number of important civic causes. He served on the city council for six years and was considered the father of Kenosha's public health and park ordinances. It was during Marlatt's watch that the Evening News took on some of the key editorial elements of a modern newspaper, including a sports page and a society section that, unlike many Wisconsin papers of that era, was allowed to give fair coverage to the women's suffrage movement. In the summer of 1914, the paper joined the Associated Press and received a bulletin service by long distance telephone, supplemented by mailed releases. Then, for several years, the Evening News relied on a telegraphed bulletin service, usually not more than a single column of late news each day. In 1917, United Press service was added to AP, an hour and a half a day of telegraphed news highlights. Two years later, AP's full-time leased wire service was installed. At that time, the newspaper hired Charlotte \\"Charlie\\" Oakes, an experienced operator from South Dakota to monitor the machine that transcribed the incoming news stories on a typewriter. An automatic teletype machine, which was 50 percent faster than the best Morse operator, was introduced to the newsroom in 1926. It could produce both typed copy and punched ticker tape to be fed directly into the linotypes. These clattering devices continued to bring the world to the Evening News editorial office until the advent of a computerized system in the mid-1970s. Wire service news gave the local paper an advantage over its Milwaukee and Chicago newsstand rivals. Besides its coverage of local happenings, the Evening News could, because of its later deadlines, bring readers more late-breaking national and international news than the competing big city papers. Later, in 1922, radio added another dimension to Evening News coverage of events elsewhere in the country and the world. A powerful receiver was installed in the editor's office and monitored for breaking news reports. The first news of President Warren Harding's death in August 1923 reached the editorial office by radio. Radio broadcasts also usually beat the wire services with sports scores and stock market reports. The Evening News also subscribed to the Newspaper Enterprise Association, which supplied features, non-timely interpretive stories, illustrations and photographs in matrix form. The National Newspaper Syndicate also furnished feature materials, including such comic strips as \\"Salesman Sam\\" and \\"The Duffs.\\" In its early days, the Evening News could be purchased at the newspaper's office, or from newsstands or \\"street boys.\\" In later years, home delivery was left to a series of independent dealers. That all changed April 1, 1921, when the company organized its own \\"guaranteed\\" delivery service to some 700 Kenosha homes. Within three years, 4,000 homes in the city and in other smaller communities in Kenosha County were getting doorstep delivery. By the newspaper's 30th anniversary, in 1924, there were 80 people on its payroll and 58 carrier boys delivering papers throughout the county. In April 1925, Walter Marlatt became ill at his desk and died a short time later at home. His brother, city editor Ernest F. Marlatt, was promoted to editor and corporate secretary. The younger Marlatt, with a master's degree from Harvard, had come to the News in 1917 from Indiana, where he had been a high school principal and superintendent of schools. As city editor, he supervised the two general assignment reporters who covered government, police and courts. He remained in the editor's chair for 23 years, during which time his staff grew to eight. Business operations were assumed by Kingsley, who became publisher and president. He led the corporation until his death in 1963, guiding the newspaper safely though the Depression. He also was active in numerous civic efforts such as Kenosha Youth Foundation, United Fund and the Chamber of Commerce. Meanwhile, the circulation of the Evening News, under the guidance of Willis H. Schulte, had shifted almost entirely to home delivery, through the development of a carrier-merchant plan. The News also became a member of the Audit Bureau of Circulations, assuring advertisers of accurate circulation figures. Schulte, who began his long association with the paper as a seven- year-old newsboy in 1914, was 17 when he was placed in charge of circulation. As his career progressed into six decades, it was estimated that he had supervised and influenced some 6,500 newspaper carrier boys and girls. In later years, his work was carried on in the circulation department, first by Frank Sisk, and now by James F. Jones.  After World War II  As World War II ended, so did the century-long history of the Evening News‚Äô companion publication, the Telegraph-Courier. Since 1894 the weekly Telegraph-Courier had served Kenoshans who preferred a summary of six days‚Äô worth of local events. Shortly before the formal opening of the remodeled building, longtime editor Ernie Marlatt suffered a heart attack at his desk and died. However, the Marlatt name, in the person of his nephew, Walter ‚ÄúBus‚Äù Marlatt Jr., outdoor writer and conservationist, continued at the paper for another decade. F. Lee Hancock, an experienced newsman from Superior, Wisconsin, arrived as managing editor in June 1947. When Marlatt died, he assumed direction of the newsroom, and, eventually, in 1963, was formally promoted to editor. Jim Barnhill, the newspaper‚Äôs sports editor and, incidentally, a professional football official, replaced Hancock as managing editor. Willis H. Schulte became general manager in 1955, and, corporate president upon Ralph S. Kingsley‚Äôs death in 1963. After Bill Schulte died on April 26, 1979, his long record of civic activities was recognized with the naming of a city park in his honor.  1960-2018  In 1961, controlling interest in the Kenosha News passed to Howard J. Brown, a newspaperman with experience in Chicago, Cleveland and at several small dailies in the east. Brown said of the newspaper business, ‚ÄúIt is not a business at all. Nor is it a way of life or even a philosophy. Newspapering, in short, is a delightful disease, the only cure for which is heavier doses of the same.‚Äù On Monday, April 30, 1962, the 67-year-old Kenosha Evening News nameplate disappeared forever, replaced on the masthead by the Kenosha News. The dropping of the word ‚ÄúEvening‚Äù was done quietly and without fanfare. In the 1970s, the Kenosha News offices at Seventh Avenue and 58th Street underwent its third major remodeling, which included the replacement of its old letterpress with the first Goss Cosmo offset press ever built, and, perhaps the most revolutionary, computerized typesetting. Electronic journalism had driven ‚Äúhot metal‚Äù from the newsroom‚Äôs back shop. They also introduced the popular Kenosha Kid article. Editor Lee Hancock retired at the beginning of 1976, replaced by Richard D. Martin, who came to Kenosha after serving 10 years as editor of the Chronicle-Tribune in Marion, Indiana. Martin was only the eighth editor in the newspaper‚Äôs 100-year history. The paper was published just six days a week, Monday through Saturday. In May 1980, the slim Saturday edition was dropped, replaced by the multi-section Sunday Kenosha News. The loss of the Saturday paper was not popular, however, and seven years later, on May 9, 1987, the News returned to Saturday publication, becoming a true 7-day-a-week daily. The daily newspaper, in time, became one element in a larger corporate structure called United Communications Corporation. In December 1988, Eugene Schulte, Willis‚Äô son and long a part of the News‚Äô management team, became senior vice president of the corporation. On August 12, 1991, the Kenosha News became a morning newspaper. The move from afternoon to morning was explained as a response to changing advertising needs and reader lifestyles. In 1992, Kenneth L. Dowdell, director of public service, and Ronald J. Montemurro, controller of United Communications Corporation, were named corporate vice presidents. On December 31, 1995, editor Richard D. Martin retired at age 62. During Martin‚Äôs tenure, the News won several awards for its news and photo coverage. In 1989, the Kenosha News was one of 74 finalists among 465 newspapers in an American Society of Newspaper Editors‚Äô survey seeking excellence in small daily newspapers. Martin was replaced in mid-January 1996 by Craig W. Swanson, who was previously editor of the Lincoln Journal, an afternoon newspaper that merged with the morning Lincoln Star.. Prior to working at the Journal, Swanson spent four years as editor of the Herald-Palladium in St. Joseph, Michigan, and five years as editor of The Mining Journal in Marquette, Michigan. He began his newspaper career as a reporter at the Daily News in Iron Mountain, Michigan, in 1975. Swanson retired in 2009, citing personal reasons.  Lee Enterprises  In January 2019, Lee Enterprises purchased Kenosha News from United Communications. The sale also included the Lake Geneva Regional News. Mark Lewis, publisher of the Racine Journal Times, was named head of the new media group comprising all three publications.  Buildings  In 1894, the Evening News home was the \\"Flatiron\\" building, which still stands at 5901 Sixth Avenue, at the corner of Main and Park. Initially, the newspaper used only the first floor offices, and the pressroom was located in the building's small basement. A few years later, it expanded to an upper floor, where a newsroom was established. By 1903, the Evening News and Telegraph-Courier had outgrown the \\"Flatiron\\" building and moved to a building on the north side of Wisconsin Street. The building, which no longer stands, was located on today's 600 block of 58th Street. With this move, the daily newspaper modernized, installing a Cranston perfecting press that could simultaneously print eight newspaper page edition. Within five years, it was outdated and was replaced with a web press that could print 8,000 copies per hour. On March 7, 1913, in a front-page story, the Evening News announced plans to erect a new newspaper plant one block west, on the opposite side of Wisconsin Street, today's corner of Seventh Avenue and 58th Street. \\"It is proposed,\\" the story said, \\"to make this the permanent home of the Kenosha Evening News.\\" Though the building has undergone three major remodelings and several additions, it remains the current home of the Kenosha News. The new fireproof brick newspaper plant was designed by Head, based on his experience in the printing business. In August 1913, the Kenosha Evening News moved into its new home. The offices, business and editorial departments, were located on the first floor, along with the job printing department, which had become an important income source for the Head-Simmons Publishing Co. The job shop was responsible for printing, illustrating, cutting and binding of all kinds of labels, circulars, booklets and programs. It handled local publications like the Women's Club bulletin and the high school newspaper, Kenews. Customers could have stationery, posters, handbills and many other items printed. Installed in the building's basement was the newspaper's own brand-new high speed rotary color press, which printed 18,000 copies per hour and was the first of its kind in Wisconsin. The entire second floor was built as a lodge hall and, for a number of years, was home to the Loyal Order of Moose. During World War I, the newspaper's hall was turned into a recreation center for soldiers and sailors who visited from the northern Illinois training camps. The Evening News again outgrew its facilities and an addition was constructed west of the existing building. When it formally opened February 19, 1924, the newspaper plant's floor space doubled and the building's general layout would continue for a quarter century. The composing room, editorial and advertising offices were moved to the second floor. The job printing department was housed on the first floor. The basement area was used for storage, including a fireproof vault to store bound copies of local newspapers, some dating back as far as 1840. Amenities were impressive, a ladies rest room, tiled toilets, ample natural skylighting, a marble stairway and attractive decor. In the addition's basement a new Goss Straightline press was installed. It was a 30-ton, -high behemoth capable of printing 32-page newspapers with various color options at a speed of 25,000 copies per hour. In 1948, the News building underwent a complete remodeling. The job printing shop disappeared, its first floor space given over to the business and advertising departments. The composing room was enlarged and a photo darkroom was installed. Highlighting the renovation was the installation of a five-unit color press, three times the size of the one it replaced. It could print up to 80 pages at once, while cutting the press run of 18,000 copies to less than two hours. Through a large picture window fronting on 58th Street, passers by could watch the daily being printed. The 1980s also saw the construction of a distribution center, including insertion equipment to accommodate the growth of preprinted advertising sections.  Advertising changes  By 1920, it was clear that streamlining and specialization was needed in the advertising department. So business manager Ralph S. Kingsley divided it into two sections, one focusing on traditional display advertising by businesses, the other to handle the growing want ad columns. These small ads have appeared in the News since its first edition, when a dozen were lumped together in a daily bargain column, which, after a century, still survives as Kenosha Kernels. Initially, the newspaper treated these few ads as something of a nuisance, a necessary nuisance, perhaps, but not a major revenue source. As their number grew, however, want ads claimed their own section of the newspaper and took on greater importance. In 1905, approximately 65 want ads appeared daily and by 1910, there were about 100. This increased to perhaps 200 in 1920. Readers had come to rely on them to such an extent that the News bragged these little ads had become as much a public utility as the electric or telephone companies. In 1923, the Evening News installed a new indexing system, the Basil L. Smith Co. National Standard, which divided all these advertisements into 11 main classifications, such as merchandise, real estate, business services. These were split into sub-categories, some 90 in all, making it easy for readers to quickly locate ads of interest to them. Soon, the newspaper could say it ran more daily classifieds than any other Wisconsin publication, except one in Milwaukee. In 1925, it included some 300 to 500 daily, and today the number often tops 1,000, not including automobile, help wanted and real estate business ads also handled by the classified department.  Bob the Evening News Dog  Editor-publisher Frank Haydon Hall had just three employees when the Kenosha Evening News started in 1894. A decade later, the staff had grown to a half dozen‚Äîand Bob the Evening News Dog. According to legend, Bob, \\"a dog of genial nature and remarkable intelligence,\\" was brought to Kenosha as a pup around 1898, probably by the editor. For a dozen years, he was a regular fixture in the newspaper office. Bob visited downtown shopkeepers and wagged greetings to countless friends, particularly the children. He had a reputation as \\"champion rat dog of the city,\\" which he proved by keeping the Evening News and neighboring buildings mostly rodent-free. When the old dog died, October 7, 1910, his passing was marked with a page one eulogy: \\"He was taken with his fatal malady on Thursday and paid his last visit to his old haunts during the afternoon ... and when he reached his bed, he never left it. Death came as a result of advanced years. A good dog, a companionable little fellow, he will be greatly missed by those who had been accustomed to see him daily during his life!\\" References External links * Newspapers published in Wisconsin Kenosha County, Wisconsin Publications established in 1894 1894 establishments in Wisconsin Lee Enterprises publications ","title":"Kenosha News"},{"id":"9746023","text":"Rock Island Township is located in Rock Island County, Illinois.

Whilst serving as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Tony Blair concurrently served as the First Lord of the Treasury, the Minister for the Civil Service, the Leader of the Labour Party (until Gordon Brown was declared Labour leader on 24 June 2007) and the Member of Parliament for Sedgefield. He remains a Privy Counsellor, having first been appointed in July 1994 when he became Leader of the Opposition. Blair is the Labour Party's longest-serving Prime Minister, the only Labour Prime Minister to have led the party to victory since 1974, and‚Äîhaving led the party to three consecutive general election victories‚Äîalso the only Labour Prime Minister to serve two full consecutive terms. Blair is both credited with and criticised for moving the Labour Party closer to the centre of British politics, using the term \\"New Labour\\" to distinguish his pro-market policies from the more socialist policies which the party had espoused in the past. In domestic government policy, Blair significantly increased public spending on healthcare and education while also introducing controversial market-based reforms in these areas. In addition, Blair's tenure saw the introduction of a minimum wage, tuition fees for higher education, constitutional reform such as devolution in Scotland and Wales and progress in the Northern Ireland peace process. The UK economy performed well and the real incomes of Britons grew 18% during 1997‚Äì2006. Blair kept to Conservative commitments not to increase income tax in the first term although rates of employee's National Insurance (a payroll levy) were increased. He also presided over a significant expansion of the welfare state during his time in office, which led to a significant reduction in relative poverty. Blair ardently supported United States foreign policy, notably by participating in the invasions of Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003. On 7 September 2006, Blair publicly stated he would step down as party leader by the time of the TUC conference in September 2007. On 10 May 2007, he announced his intention to resign as UK Prime Minister on 27 June 2007. First term (1997‚Äì2001) =Independence for the Bank of England= Immediately after taking office, Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown gave the Bank of England the power to set the UK base rate of interest autonomously, as agreed in 1992 in the Maastricht Treaty. This decision was popular with the British financial establishment in London, which the Labour Party had been courting since the early-1990s. Together with the Government's decision to remain within projected Conservative spending limits for its first two years in office, it helped to reassure sceptics of the Labour Party's fiscal \\"prudence\\". Associated changes moved regulation of banks away from the Bank of England to the Financial Services Authority- and these changes were unwound in 2013 following perceived failures by the FSA in the banking crisis. =Euro= The Blair ministry decided against joining the Eurozone, and adopting the euro as the currency to replace the pound sterling. This decision was generally supported by the British public, and by all political parties in the UK, as well as the media. On 24 June 1998, The Sun had famously put the front-page headline \\"Is THIS the most dangerous man in Britain?\\" beside a photograph of Blair, when it was still uncertain whether he would lead Britain into the Euro, or keep the sterling currency. =Domestic politics= In the early years of his first term, Blair relied on political advice from a close circle of his staff, among whom was his press secretary and official spokesman Alastair Campbell. Campbell was permitted to give orders to civil servants, who had previously taken instructions only from ministers. Unlike some of his predecessors, Campbell was a political appointee and had not come up through the Civil Service. Despite his overtly political role, he was paid from public funds as a civil servant. Also in Blair's team were a number of strong female aides, who acted as gatekeepers and go-betweens, including Anji Hunter, Kate Garvey, Ruth Turner and Sally Morgan. Blair in Armagh, Northern Ireland, September 1998 A significant achievement of Blair's first term was the signing, on 10 April 1998, of the Belfast Agreement, more commonly referred to as the \\"Good Friday Agreement\\". In the Good Friday Agreement, most Northern Irish political parties, together with the UK and Irish Governments, agreed upon an \\"exclusively peaceful and democratic\\" framework for the governance of Northern Ireland and a new set of political institutions for the province. In November 1998, Blair became the first UK Prime Minister to address D√°il √âireann. The Scottish Parliament Building in Holyrood Blair's first term saw an extensive programme of changes to the constitution. The Human Rights Act was introduced in 1998; a Scottish Parliament and a Welsh Assembly were established following referenda held with a majority voting in favour; most hereditary peers were removed from the House of Lords in 1999; the Greater London Authority and the position of Mayor of London were established in 2000; and the Freedom of Information Act was passed later in the same year, with its provisions coming into effect over the following decade. This last Act disappointed campaigners , whose hopes had been raised by a 1998 White Paper which had promised more robust legislation. Blair later described the FoIA as one of his \\"biggest regrets\\", writing in his autobiography, \\"I shudder at the imbecility of it.\\" Whether the House of Lords should be fully appointed, fully elected, or be subject to a combination of the two remains a disputed question to the present day. 2003 saw a series of inconclusive votes on the subject in the House of Commons. Significant change took place to legislation relating to rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people during Blair's period in office. During his first term, the age of consent for homosexuals was equalised at sixteen years of age (see Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000) and the ban on homosexuals in the armed forces was lifted. Subsequently, in 2005, a Civil Partnership Act came into effect, allowing gay couples to form legally recognised partnerships with the same rights as a traditional heterosexual marriage. At the end of September 2006, more than 30,000 Britons had entered into Civil Partnerships as a result of this law. Adoption by same- sex couples was legalised, and discrimination in the workplace (Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003), and in relation to the provision of goods and services (Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations) were both made illegal. Transgender people were given the right to change their birth certificate to reflect their new gender as a result of the Gender Recognition Act 2004. Tony Blair's touch was less sure with regard to the Millennium Dome project. The incoming government greatly expanded the size of the project and consequently increased expectations of what would be delivered. Just before its opening, Blair claimed the Dome would be \\"a triumph of confidence over cynicism, boldness over blandness, excellence over mediocrity\\". In the words of BBC correspondent Robert Orchard, \\"the Dome was to be highlighted as a glittering New Labour achievement in the next election manifesto\\". =Social policies= During his first term as Prime Minister, Blair raised taxes; introduced a National Minimum Wage and some new employment rights; introduced significant constitutional reforms; promoted new rights for gay people in the Civil Partnership Act 2004; and signed treaties integrating the UK more closely with the EU. He introduced substantial market-based reforms in the education and health sectors; introduced student tuition fees; sought to reduce certain categories of welfare payments, and introduced tough anti-terrorism and identity card legislation. Under Blair's government, the amount of new legislation increased which attracted criticism.Blair's 'frenzied law making' : a new offence for every day spent in office 16 August 2006. Retrieved 12 March 2010. Blair increased police powers by adding to the number of arrestable offences, compulsory DNA recording and the use of dispersal orders.Jon Silverman, Legal affairs analyst, \\"Blair's new look civil liberties\\", BBC News, 14 May 2007 According to one study, in terms of promoting social equality, the first Blair Government \\"turned out to be the most redistributive in decades; it ran Harold Wilson's 1960s' government close.\\" From 1997-2005, for instance, all the benefits targeted on children through Tax Credits, Child Benefit and Income Support had gone up by 72% in real terms. Improvements were also made in financial support to pensioners, and by 2004, the poorest third of pensioners were ¬£1,750 a year better off than under the system as it used to be. As a means of reducing energy costs and therefore the incidence of fuel poverty, a new programme of grants for cavity wall and loft insulation and for draught proofing was launched, with some 670,000 homes taking up the scheme. Various adjustments were also made in social welfare benefits. Families were allowed to earn a little more before Housing Benefit was cut, and the benefit was raised for families where the main earner worked part-time, while 2,000,000 pensioners were offered automatic help with their council tax bills, worth ¬£400 each, although many did not take advantage of this benefit. According to one study, the Blair ministry's record on benefits, taken in the round, was \\"unprecedented,\\" with 3.7% real terms growth each year from 2002-2005.Better of Worse? Has Labour Delivered? By Polly Toynbee and David Walker Under the years of the Blair ministry, expenditure on social services was increased, while various anti- poverty measures were introduced. From 2001-2005, public spending increased by an average of 4.8% in real terms, while spending on transport went up by 8.5% per annum, health by 8.2% per annum, and education by 5.4% per annum. Between 1997-2005, child poverty was more than halved in absolute terms as a result of measures such as the extension of maternity pay, increases in child benefit, and by the growth in the numbers of people in employment. During that same period, the number of pensioners living in poverty fell by over 75% in absolute terms as a result of initiatives such as the introduction of Winter Fuel Payments, the reduction of VAT on fuel, and the introduction of a Minimum Income Guarantee. To reduce poverty traps for those making the transition from welfare to work, a minimum wage was established, together with a Working Tax Credit and a Child Tax Credit. Together with various tax credit schemes to supplement low earnings, the Blair Government's policies significantly increased the earnings of the lowest income decile.Ten Years of New Labour edited by Matt Beech and Simon Lee In addition, under the Working Time Regulations of 1998, British workers gained a statutory entitlement to paid holidays. Between 1997-2003, spending on early years education and childcare rose in real terms from ¬£2.0 billion to ¬£3.6 billion. During Blair's first term in office, 100 \\"Early Excellence\\" centres opened, together with new nurseries, while 500 Sure Start projects began. Although the number of children fell, the amount of state support to families with children increased, with money paid only to them (child contingent support) going up by 52% in real terms from 1999‚Äì2005. The Blair ministry also extended to three- year-olds the right to a free nursery place for half a day Monday to Friday. Tax credits assisted some 300,000 families (at January 2004) with childcare costs, while the 2004 budget exempted the first ¬£50 of weekly payments to nannies and childminders from tax and National Insurance, restricted to couples earning not more than ¬£43,000 per annum. The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 extended a legal right to walk to about 3,200 square miles of open countryside, mainly in the North of England. During its first year in office, the Blair Government made the controversial decision of cutting Lone Parent Benefit, which led to abstentions amongst many Labour MPs. In March 1998, however, Brown responded in his Budget statement by increasing child benefit by ¬£2.50 a week above the rate of inflation, the largest ever increase in the benefit. Public expenditure on education, health, and social security rose more rapidly under the Blair government than it did under previous Labour governments, the latter due to initiatives such as the introduction of the Working Families Tax Credit and increases in pensions and child benefits. During the Blair Government's time in office, incomes for the bottom 10% of earners increased as a result of transfers through the social security system. New rights for workers were introduced such as extended parental rights, a significant raising of the maximum compensation figure for unfair dismissal, a restoration of the qualifying period for protection against unfair dismissal to twelve months, and the right to be accompanied by a trade union official during a disciplinary or grievance hearing, whether or not a trade union is recognised. In addition, an Employee Relation Act was passed which introduced for the first time ever, the legal right of employees to trade union representation. In 2003, the Working Families Tax Credit was split into two benefits: a Working Tax Credit which was payable to all those in work, and a Child Tax Credit which was payable to all families with children, whether in work or not. During Blair's time in office, over 2,000,000 people had been lifted out of poverty. A proportional voting system was introduced for the election of Britain's MEPs, while legislation changing executive structures in local government was passed. Regional Development Agencies were set up in the 8 English regions outside London, and changes were made to the regulation of political parties and referendums, with the introduction of a new Electoral Commission and stricter spending rules. In addition, voting experiments resulted in an opening up of postal voting and reform of electoral registration, while the right of hereditary peers to sit in the House of Lords was abolished after 700 years. In addition, the Water Industries Act 1999 ended the right of water companies to disconnect supplies \\"as a sanction against non-payment.\\"Transforming Britain: Labour‚Äôs Second Term edited by Adrian Harvey The Employment Act 2002 extended rights to paternity, maternity, and adoption leave and pay, while the Police Reform Act 2002 established community support officers and reorganised national intelligence gathering. The Adoption and Children Act 2002 enabled unmarried couples to apply to adopt while speeding up adoption procedures, while the Private Hire Vehicles (Carriage of Guide Dogs) Act 2002 banned charges for guide dogs in minicabs. The International Development Act 2002 required spending to be used to reduce poverty and improve the welfare of the poor. The Travel Concessions (Eligibility) Act 2002 equalised the age at which men and women become entitled to travel concessions. Under the Homelessness Act 2002, councils had to adopt homelessness strategies and do more for those homeless through no fault of their own, and the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002 made it easier to convert long-term residential leasehold into freehold through \\"commonhold\\" tenures. The British Overseas Territories Act 2002 extended full British citizenship to 200,000 inhabitants of 14 British Overseas Territories, while the Office of Communications Act 2002 set up a new regulatory body known as the Office of Communications (Ofcom). The Enterprise Act 2002 included measures to safeguard consumers, while also reforming bankruptcy and establishing a stronger Office of Fair Trading. =Immigration= Non-European immigration rose significantly during the period from 1997, not least because of the government's abolition of the primary purpose rule in June 1997. This change made it easier for UK residents to bring foreign spouses into the country. The former government advisor Andrew Neather in the Evening Standard stated that the deliberate policy of ministers from late-2000 until early-2008 was to open up the UK to mass migration. =Foreign policy= In 1999, Blair planned and presided over the declaration of the Kosovo War. While in opposition, the Labour Party had criticised the Conservatives for their perceived weakness during the Bosnian war, and Blair was among those urging a strong line by NATO against Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá. Blair was criticised both by those on the left who opposed the war in principle and by some others who believed that the Serbs were fighting a legitimate war of self-defence. One month into the war, on 22 April 1999, Blair made a speech in Chicago setting out his \\"Doctrine of the International Community\\". This later became known by the media as the \\"Blair doctrine\\", and played a part in Blair's decision to order the British military intervention in the Sierra Leone Civil War in May 2000. Another significant change in 1997 was the creation of the Department for International Development, shifting global development policy away from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to an independent ministry with a Cabinet- level minister. Also in 1999, Blair was awarded the Charlemagne Prize by the German city of Aachen for his contributions to the European ideal and to peace in Europe. Second term (2001‚Äì2005) President Bush to Chequers on 19 July 2001 In the 2001 general election campaign, Blair emphasised the theme of improving public services, notably the National Health Service and the State education system. The Conservatives concentrated on opposing British membership of the Euro, which did little to win over floating voters. The Labour Party retained its large parliamentary majority, and Blair became the first Labour Prime Minister to win a full second term. However, the election was notable for a large fall in voter turnout. =War in Afghanistan= Following the 11 September 2001 attacks on New York City and Washington DC, Blair was very quick to align the UK with the United States, engaging in a round of shuttle diplomacy to help form and maintain an international coalition prior to the 2001 war against Afghanistan. He maintains his diplomatic activity to this day, showing a willingness to visit countries that other world leaders might consider too dangerous to visit. In 2003, he became the first Briton since Winston Churchill to be awarded a Congressional Gold Medal by the United States Congress for being \\"a staunch and steadfast ally of the United States of America\\", although media attention has been drawn to the fact that Blair has yet to attend the ceremony to receive his medal. In 2003, Blair was also awarded an Ellis Island Medal of Honor for his support of the United States after 9/11‚Äîthe first non-American to receive the honour. =War in Iraq= Blair gave strong support to US President George W. Bush's invasion of Iraq in 2003. He soon became the face of international support for the war, often clashing with French President Jacques Chirac, who became the face of international opposition. Widely regarded as a more persuasive speaker than Bush, Blair gave many speeches arguing for the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in the days leading up to the invasion. Blair's case for war was based on Iraq's alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction and consequent violation of UN resolutions. He was wary of making direct appeals for regime change, since international law does not recognise this as a ground for war. A memorandum from a July 2002 meeting that was leaked in April 2005 showed that Blair believed that the British public would support regime change in the right political context; the document, however, stated that legal grounds for such action were weak. On 24 September 2002, the UK Government published a dossier based on the intelligence agencies' assessments of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Among the items in the dossier was a recently received intelligence report that \\"the Iraqi military are able to deploy chemical or biological weapons within 45 minutes of an order to do so\\". A further briefing paper on Iraq's alleged WMDs was issued to journalists in February 2003. This document was discovered to have taken a large part of its text without attribution from a PhD thesis available on the internet. Where the thesis hypothesised about possible WMDs, the Downing Street version presented the ideas as fact. The document subsequently became known as the \\"Dodgy Dossier\\". 46,000 British troops, one-third of the total strength of the British Army (land forces), were deployed to assist with the invasion of Iraq. When after the war, no Weapons of Mass Destruction were found in Iraq, the two dossiers, together with Blair's other pre-war statements, became an issue of considerable controversy. Many Labour Party members, including a number who had supported the war, were among the critics. Successive independent inquiries (including those by the Foreign Affairs Select Committee of the House of Commons, the senior judge Lord Hutton, and the former senior civil servant Lord Butler of Brockwell) have found that Blair honestly stated what he believed to be true at the time, though Lord Butler's report did imply that the Government's presentation of the intelligence evidence had been subject to some degree of exaggeration. These findings have not prevented frequent accusations that Blair was deliberately deceitful, and, during the 2005 election campaign, Conservative leader Michael Howard made political capital out of the issue. Then Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, stated in September 2004 that the invasion was \\"illegal\\", but did not state the legal basis for this assertion. Prior to the war, the UK Attorney General Lord Goldsmith, who acts as the Government's legal advisor, had advised Blair that the war was legal. British Armed Forces were active in southern Iraq to stabilise the country in the run-up to the Iraqi elections of January 2005. In October 2004, the UK government agreed to a request from US forces to send a battalion of the Black Watch regiment to the American sector to free up US troops for an assault on Fallujah. The subsequent deployment of the Black Watch was criticised by some in Britain on the grounds that its alleged ultimate purpose was to assist George Bush's re-election in the 2004 US presidential election. As of September 2006, 7,500 British forces remain in Southern Iraq, around the city of Basra. After the presidential election, Blair tried to use his relationship with President Bush to persuade the US to devote efforts to resolving the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. In an interview with David Frost on Al Jazeera in November 2006, Blair appeared to agree with Frost's assessment that the war had been \\"pretty much of a disaster\\", although a Downing Street spokesperson denied that this was an accurate reflection of Blair's view. =Domestic politics= After fighting the 2001 general election on the theme of improving public services, Blair's government raised taxes in 2002 (described by the Conservatives as \\"stealth taxes\\") to increase spending on education and health. Blair insisted the increased funding would have to be matched by internal reforms. The government introduced the Foundation Hospitals scheme to allow NHS hospitals financial autonomy, although the eventual shape of the proposals, after an internal Labour Party struggle with Gordon Brown, allowed for less freedom than Blair had wished. But with the supply of healthcare services increasing less quickly than demand, benefits from the NHS have not yet increased to the same degree, and the NHS had an ¬£800,000,000 deficit for the 2005/6 financial year. The peace process in Northern Ireland hit a series of problems. In October 2002, the Northern Ireland Assembly established under the Good Friday Agreement was suspended. Attempts to persuade the IRA to decommission its weapons were unsuccessful, and, in the second set of elections to the Assembly in November 2003, the staunchly unionist Democratic Unionist Party replaced the more moderate Ulster Unionist Party as Northern Ireland's largest unionist party, making a return to devolved government more difficult. At the same time, Sinn F√©in replaced the more moderate SDLP as the province's largest nationalist party. In its first term, the government had introduced an annual fixed tuition fee of around ¬£1,000 for higher education students (rejecting requests from universities to be allowed to vary the fee), with reductions and exemptions for poorer students. At the same time, the remaining student maintenance grant was replaced with a low-interest loan, which was to be repaid once the student was earning over a certain threshold. In 2003, Blair introduced legislation permitting universities to charge variable fees of up to ¬£3,000 per year. At the same time, the repayment of student loans was delayed until the graduate's income was much higher, and grants were reintroduced for some students from poorer backgrounds. It was claimed the increase in university fees violated a promise in Labour's 2001 general election manifesto, though this claim is arguably unsustainable if the relevant promise is interpreted strictly and literally. At its second reading in the House of Commons in January 2004, the Higher Education Bill which contained the changes was passed with a majority of only five votes, due to a large-scale backbench Labour rebellion. A defeat was averted by a last-minute change of intention by a small number of Gordon Brown's backbench allies.. Effigy of Tony Blair from a 2003 anti-war demonstration against the Iraq War On 1 August 2003, Blair became the longest continuously-serving Labour Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, surpassing Clement Attlee's six-year term from 1945‚Äì51. The Hutton Inquiry into the death of Dr. David Kelly reported on 2 August, ruled that he had committed suicide, and despite widespread expectations that the report would criticise Blair and his government, Hutton cleared the Government of deliberately inserting false intelligence into the September Dossier, while criticising the BBC editorial process which had allowed unfounded allegations to be broadcast. Evidence to the inquiry raised further questions over the use of intelligence in the run- up to the war, and the report did not satisfy opponents of Blair and of the war. After a similar decision by President Bush, Blair set up another inquiry‚Äîthe Butler Review‚Äîinto the accuracy and presentation of the intelligence relating to Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction. Opponents of the war, especially the Liberal Democrats, refused to participate in this inquiry, since it did not meet their demands for a full public inquiry into whether the war was justified . The political fallout from the Iraq War continued to dog Blair's premiership after the Butler Review. On 25 August 2004, Plaid Cymru MP Adam Price announced he would attempt to impeach Blair, hoping to invoke a Parliamentary procedure that has lain dormant for 150 years but has never been abolished. However, of 640 MPs in the House of Commons only 23 backed the Commons motion‚Äîofficially known as an Early day motion‚Äîin support of considering \\"whether there exist sufficient grounds to impeach\\" Blair (a 24th MP signed the motion but later withdrew his name). The Early Day Motion has now expired. In April 2004, Blair announced that a referendum would be held on the ratification of the EU Constitution. This represented a significant development in British politics: only one nationwide referendum had previously been held (in 1975, on whether the UK should remain in the EEC), though a referendum had been promised if the Government decided to join the Euro, and referendums had been held on devolved structures of government in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It was a dramatic change of policy for Blair, who had previously dismissed calls for a referendum unless the constitution fundamentally altered the UK's relationship with the EU. Michael Howard seized upon this \\"EU-turn\\", reminding Blair of his declaration to the 2003 Labour Party conference that \\"I can only go one way. I haven't got a reverse gear\\". The referendum was expected to be held in early 2006; however, after the French and Dutch rejections of the constitution, the Blair government announced it was suspending plans for a referendum for the foreseeable future. During his second term, Blair was increasingly the target for protests. His speech to the 2004 Labour Party conference, for example, was interrupted both by a protester against the Iraq War and by a group that opposed the government's decision to allow the House of Commons to ban fox hunting. On 15 September 2004, Blair delivered a speech on the environment and the 'urgent issue' of climate change. In unusually direct language he concluded that \\"If what the science tells us about climate change is correct, then unabated it will result in catastrophic consequences for our world ... The science, almost certainly, is correct.\\" The action he proposed to take appeared to be based on business and investment rather than legislative or tax-based attempts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions: \\"it is possible to combine reducing emissions with economic growth ... investment in science and technology and in the businesses associated with it\\". =Health problems= On 19 October 2003, it emerged Blair had received treatment for an irregular heartbeat. Having felt ill the previous day, he went to hospital and was diagnosed with supraventricular tachycardia. This was treated by cardioversion and he returned home that night. He was reported to have taken the following day (20 October) more gently than usual and returned to a full schedule on 21 October. Downing Street aides later suggested the palpitations had been brought on by drinking lots of strong coffee at an EU summit and then working- out vigorously in the gym. However, former minister Lewis Moonie, a doctor, said the treatment was more serious than Number 10 had admitted: \\"Anaesthetising somebody and giving their heart electric shocks is not something you just do in the routine run of medical practice.\\" In September 2004, in off-the-cuff remarks during an interview with ITV News, Lord Bragg said Blair was \\"under colossal strain\\" over \\"considerations of his family\\" and that Blair had thought \\"things over very carefully.\\" This led to speculation Blair would resign. Although details of a family problem were known by the press, no paper reported them because according to one journalist, to have done so would have breached \\"the bounds of privacy and media responsibility.\\" Blair underwent a catheter ablation to correct his irregular heartbeat on 1 October 2004, after announcing the procedure on the previous day, in a series of interviews in which he also declared he would seek a third term as Prime Minister, but not a fourth. The planned procedure was carried out at London's Hammersmith Hospital. =Connaught Square= At the same time as Blair's operation, it was disclosed the Blairs had purchased a house at 29 Connaught Square, London, for a reported ¬£3,500,000. Third term (2005‚Äì2007) The Labour Party won the 2005 general election held on Thursday 5 May and a third consecutive term in office, for the first time ever. However, Labour won fewer votes in England than the Conservatives. The next day, Blair was invited to form a government by Queen Elizabeth II. The reduction in the Labour Party's majority (from 167 to 66 seats) and the low share of the popular vote (35%) led to some Labour MPs calling for Blair to leave office sooner rather than later; among them was Frank Dobson, who had served in Blair's cabinet during his first term. However, dissenting voices quickly vanished as Blair took on European leaders over the future direction of the European Union in June 2005. This election also marks the most recent victory by the Labour Party. =G8 and EU presidencies= The rejection by France and the Netherlands of the treaty to establish a constitution for the European Union presented Blair with an opportunity to postpone a UK referendum and Foreign Secretary Jack Straw announced that the Parliamentary Bill to enact a referendum was suspended indefinitely. It had previously been agreed that ratification would continue unless the treaty had been rejected by at least five of the 25 European Union member states who must all ratify it. In an address to the European Parliament, Blair stated: \\"I believe in Europe as a political project. I believe in Europe with a strong and caring social dimension.\\" Jacques Chirac held several meetings with Schr√∂der and the pair pressed for the UK to give up the rebate won by Margaret Thatcher in 1984. After verbal conflict over several weeks, Blair, along with the leaders of all 25 EU member states, descended on Brussels for the EU Summit of 18 June 2005 to attempt to finalise the EU budget for 2007‚Äì13. Blair refused to renegotiate the rebate unless the proposals included a compensating overhaul of EU spending, particularly on the Common Agricultural Policy which composes 44% of the EU budget. The CAP stayed as it was agreed upon in 2002 and no decision about the budget was reached under the Luxembourg presidency. Now it fell to Blair to broker a deal on the EU budget during the UK's Presidency of the European Union during the latter half of 2005. Early international opinion, particularly in the French press, suggested that Blair held a strong opening position partly on account of the concurrence of British presidencies of the EU and G8. However, early in the UK's six-month term; the 7 July 2005 London bombings distracted political attention from the EU despite some ambitious early statements about Blair's agenda. Domestically, Blair faced further distractions from European affairs including a resurgent Conservative Party under its newly elected leader David Cameron, and assessments of the British presidency's achievements under Blair have been lukewarm in spite of some diplomatic success including a last-minute budget deal. One of the results of which was an agreement to increase British contributions to the EU Development Budget for new member countries, which effectively reduced the UK rebate by 20% . =London to host the 2012 Summer Olympics= On 6 July 2005, during the 117th International Olympic Committee (IOC) session in Singapore, the IOC announced that the 2012 Summer Olympics, the Games of the XXX Olympiad, were awarded to London over Paris by only four votes. The competition between Paris and London to host the Games had become increasingly heated particularly after French President Jacques Chirac commented three days before the vote that \\"one cannot trust people [ie: the British] whose cuisine are so bad.\\" The surprise win by London over the perceived frontrunner Paris was said to have been decided by the presence of Blair at the IOC session. Irish IOC member Patrick Hickey said, \\"This is down to Tony Blair. If he hadn't come here I'd say that six to eight votes would have been lost and London would not be sitting here today winners\\". =2005 London bombings= Blair, flanked by G8 leaders, reads a statement on their behalf condemning the attacks in London. On Thursday 7 July 2005, a series of four bomb explosions struck London's public transport system during the morning rush-hour. All four incidents were suicide bombings. Fifty-six people were killed and 700 people were injured. The incident was the deadliest single act of terrorism in the United Kingdom since the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland which killed 270 people and replaced the 1998 Omagh bombing (29 dead) as the second-most deadly terrorist attack on British soil. It was also the deadliest bombing in London since World War II. Blair made a statement about the day's bombings, saying that he believed it was \\"reasonably clear\\" that it was an act of terror, and that he hoped the people of Britain could demonstrate that their will to overcome the events is greater than the terrorists' wish to cause destruction. He also said that his determination to \\"defend\\" the British way of life outweighed \\"extremist determination\\" to destroy it . On 13 July 2005, he told that international co- operation would be needed to \\"pull up this evil ideology by its roots\\". On 21 July 2005, a second series of explosions were reported in London, two weeks and some hours after the 7 July 2005 London bombings. Four controlled explosions, of devices considerably less advanced than those of the previous attacks, were carried out at Shepherd's Bush, Warren Street and Oval underground stations, and on a bus in Shoreditch. Even though the attacks on 21 July were less severe than those two weeks earlier, Blair was reported to have said that the bombings in London today were intended \\"to scare people and to frighten them, to make them anxious and worried\\". He went on to say how the \\"police have done their very best, and the security services too, in the situation, and I think we have just got to react calmly and continue with our business as much as possible normal\\". Concerns about terror attacks led to 10 Downing Street requesting media organisations not to identify the location of Blair's 2005 summer holiday. After Blair attended a public function it was acknowledged that the holiday was in Barbados, as a guest of the singer Cliff Richard with whom Blair had stayed with before. During a renewed stay there in August 2006, Blair refused to endorse calls for a ceasefire in Lebanon . A Guardian/ICM poll conducted after the first wave of attacks found that 64% of the British population believed that Blair's decision to wage war in Iraq had led indirectly to the terrorist attacks on London. The public did however indicate approval of Blair's handling of the attacks, with his approval rating moving into positive territory for the first time in five years. In December 2005, Blair was presented with the \\"Statesman of the Decade\\" award by the EastWest Institute, a trans-Atlantic think tank that organises an annual Security Conference in Brussels. Proposed laws to cope with the threat of terrorism proved extremely controversial; an amendment to require that glorifying terrorism be deliberate to be an offence was rejected in the House of Commons by just three votes (a result initially announced as a one-vote margin, due to a miscount). The proposal to allow terrorist suspects to be held for questioning for up to 90 days was defeated on 9 November by a margin of 31 with 49 Labour MPs voting against the government. Instead, MPs supported an amendment to allow questioning for 28 days proposed by veteran backbencher David Winnick. This was Blair's first defeat on the floor of the House of Commons since he became Prime Minister in 1997, and most commentators saw this as seriously undermining his authority. =Education reforms, 2006= The introduction of further reforms to the education system, which restricted the involvement of local education authorities in opening new schools, proved controversial. Labour backbenchers opposed to the proposals produced a rival manifesto, and the Bill to introduce the changes was delayed while the government negotiated with them. The Conservative Party declared its support for the reforms, making passage certain but increasing the likelihood that Labour MPs would vote against them. On 15 March 2006, the Education and Inspections Bill passed its second reading, with 52 Labour MPs voting against; had the Conservative Party also voted against it would have been defeated. =Local elections on 4 May 2006 and cabinet reshuffle= The local elections in England on 4 May 2006 dealt a blow to Blair, with the loss of 317 seats and 18 councils. This result was thought to be partly continued fallout from public dissatisfaction over the decision to invade Iraq, and partly due to a scandal concerning the Home Office's mishandling of the deportation of foreign criminals. At the same time, an affair of Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott with his diary secretary had been made public. Further, some Primary care and Hospital Trust sustained significant deficits and had to release staff, which called into question the position of Health Secretary Patricia Hewitt. On 5 May, Blair reshuffled his Cabinet. Most significantly, Home Secretary Charles Clarke and Foreign Secretary Jack Straw were relieved of their duties and many other positions were reassigned. =Darfur= Blair urged EU member states on 20 October 2006 to send a strong message to the Sudanese government that it must allow a UN force into Darfur, arguing that it is a critical time for Darfur and therefore a chance for the EU to strengthen the pressure on the Sudanese government. =Debate over Muslim women wearing veils= A debate over Muslim women wearing veils developed after Leader of the House of Commons Jack Straw said he asked women in his constituency to remove them when they visited him. Blair believed that this was a \\"mark of separation\\" and made some \\"outside the community feel uncomfortable\\". He also backed Kirklees Council, which suspended a classroom assistant Aishah Azmi for refusing to remove her full-face veil at school. =Cash for Honours= Blair was interviewed in connection with the \\"Cash for Honours\\" investigation by the police in December 2006, the first time that a serving Prime Minister has been questioned by police regarding a criminal investigation.Blair questioned in honours probe, BBC, 14 December 2006 He was interviewed for a second time on 26 January 2007 after the arrest of Downing Street official Ruth Turner. An embargo was placed on this news at the request of the Metropolitan Police until 1 February.Blair interviewed again by police, BBC, 1 February 2007 =Resignation as Labour Party leader and Prime Minister= After the 2004 Labour Party conference, on 30 September 2004, Blair announced in a BBC interview that he would serve a \\"full third term\\" but would not contest a fourth general election. No term limits existed in British politics at that time, and such an announcement was historically unprecedented. Blair said he would give \\"ample time\\" for his successor to establish himself before the next general election, likely to be held in 2009 or 2010. Following the 2005 general election, in which Labour was re-elected but with a significantly reduced majority; there was constant speculation over the date of Blair's departure from office. At Westminster, he was expected to retire after the proposed UK referendum on a European Union Constitution, but the constitution being thwarted at referendum in other countries negated any need for one in the UK (such a major issue as a union- wide constitution would require unanimity amongst the EU's member states). The 7/7 terror attacks also reduced the likelihood of an early departure. Speculation as to the likely timing of Blair's departure increased in May 2006, following Labour's poor results at the English local elections. It was reported on 30 July 2006 that Blair had agreed to a ¬£4,000,000 deal, in exchange his personal diaries, with a publishing firm owned by Rupert Murdoch. On 5 September 2006, a letter signed by 17 Labour MPs called for Tony Blair to resign. On the same day, 49 other Labour MPs signed a statement supporting Blair's departure timetable. The next day The Sun reported that Blair would step down as Leader of the Labour Party on 31 May 2007, and as Prime Minister when a new leader is elected. That same day, seven of the MPs who signed the letter resigned as Parliamentary Private Secretaries (unpaid and unofficial posts assisting Government ministers). On 7 September 2006, Blair announced that the 2006 Labour Party conference would be his last as leader (in other words, he planned to resign by September 2007). He did not announce a specific timetable for either his departure or the election of a new leader, but he did state that he would \\"set a precise date\\" at some point in the future. On 26 September 2006, he restated this at Labour's annual conference \\"this is my last conference as leader\\". On 24 November 2006, Tony Blair addressed the Scottish Labour Party conference as Labour Party leader and Prime Minister for the last time. Blair in Osnabr√ºck, Germany, 25 March 2007 His successor was widely expected to be Gordon Brown, the-then Chancellor of the Exchequer, who launched his leadership bid on 11 May 2007. The only other politician to formally declare himself a contender for the Labour leadership following Blair's departure was the left-wing Labour MP John McDonnell, who launched his campaign on 14 July 2006. To stand in the leadership contest, candidates required the nominations of 12.5% of sitting Labour MPs‚Äîthen 44 MPs. On 2 May 2007, on the tenth anniversary of the 1997 general election, Tony Blair announced that he would be stepping down as Prime Minister in a matter of weeks. He further encouraged Gordon Brown as his successor as Leader of the Labour Party. On 3 May, it was further clarified by Downing Street that the exact date of resignation would be announced on 10 May. The following election of a new leader of the Labour Party was expected to take 48 days. On 10 May 2007, Blair held a Cabinet meeting where he told his ministers about his resignation plans and later making a speech at the Trimdon Labour Club in his Sedgefield constituency before announcing at a press conference that he would step down as Prime Minister on 27 June 2007 and that he would be asking the NEC to begin seeking a successor as Labour leader immediately. His deputy, John Prescott, announced that he was also stepping down as Deputy Prime Minister later in the day at his local meeting in Hull. Blair began a world tour with a visit to Paris on 11 May 2007 to visit newly-elected French president Nicolas Sarkozy. His last two major events were the 33rd G8 summit in Heiligendamm and the European Council summit from 21‚Äì22 June 2007. Gordon Brown was duly elected Labour leader as the only successfully nominated candidate with 313 nominations compared to John McDonnell's 29 at close of nominations on 17 May 2007, the result being declared formally and coming into effect on 24 June 2007 with Tony Blair resigning as Prime Minister on 27 June 2007 and Gordon Brown being asked to form a government by The Queen later that day. Blair stepped down as an MP immediately triggering a by-election in Sedgefield. He declined the traditional seat in the House of Lords offered to former Prime Ministers, commenting that it was \\"not my scene\\".Oonagh Blackman The Blair interview: I won't be Lord Blair Mirror 14 December 2005  \\"Presidential\\" Premiership  = Presidential Nature = Tony Blair's premiership has been termed as ‚Äòpresidential‚Äô by various political commentators and authors. In 1997, Dan Balz of Washington Post narrated his take on Blair's leadership: \\"Tony Blair has adopted many persons as Britain‚Äôs leader: political reformer, griever in chief, general host of Friday night town meetings, relentless enforcer of a disciplined message. Both as a candidate and as Prime Minister, Blair has embraced a presidential style of leadership geared for the age of television and the era of declining faith of political parties\\". Tony Blair's presidential style of leadership was also the subject of study of Michael Foley's book The British Presidency: Tony Blair and the Politics of Public Leadership. Foley uses Blair's premiership as a case study to further the ‚Äòpresidentialisation thesis‚Äô, which is a model used to study the growing power of the British Prime Minister at the behest of the Cabinet, and the Parliament. According to Foley, centralisation of power under Blair, and his broader conduct in office points to the cementing of presidential tendencies in British politics. He writes: ‚ÄúThe British Prime Minister has evolved, and is evolving away from what a Prime Minister used to do and used to be‚Ä¶ Blair‚Äôs premiership represents another part of the clinching proof that British politics has accommodated and adjusted to a distinctive presidential dimension‚Äù. Thomas Poguntke and Paul Webb also studied the presidentialisation of the British government, and have mentioned the various aspects of Blair's premiership, that as whole, point to his presidential nature. These included: * Tony Blair's heavy reliance on the Prime Minister's Office for decision making rather than the Cabinet. * His step of strengthening the executive office at Whitehall. * Extensive changes were made to the Prime Minister's Office, which also included the appointment of a Chief of Staff. * The size of the Prime Minister Office increased from 110 to 150 by the end of Blair's first term as premier. Special advisors assisting Blair increased from 8 (during John Major's term) to 25. Collectively, Blair's premiership has been informally referred to by many academics and political opponents as a \\"sofa government\\", as Blair was reliant on his advisors and close colleagues for decision making, rather than the Cabinet. This depiction of Blair has been endorsed by various of Blair's own party member and ministers, including, Graham Allen, Mo Mowlam and Claire Short. The Butler Review of 2004 also criticised Blair's style of sofa government. = Blair Defended = Various authors and writers have criticised the application of the presidentialisation thesis on the premiership of Tony Blair and have instead defended Blair. They have termed the use of presidential analogies for Blair as an unfair comparison between two systems that are fundamentally different. According to Richard Heffernan, for example, British Prime Ministers, including Blair, have dispensed their duties in a parliamentary model of governance, which is essentially very different from presidential models, which are largely based on the principle of separation of powers. In this context, Blair had four defeats in the Parliament, including an amendment that would have allowed the conditional detention of terrorism suspects. Political commentators have also pointed to the constant tussle between the Chancellor Gordon Brown and Tony Blair as evidence that the Prime Minister was not all too powerful. This, according to them, demonstrates that the Cabinet was still an effective arena for political dialogue. Chancellorship of Gordon Brown (1997‚Äì2007) Gordon Brown speaking at the annual World Bank/IMF meeting in 2002 Gordon Brown served as Chancellor of the Exchequer of the United Kingdom from the Labour Party's 1997 general election victory on 2 May 1997 to 27 June 2007, when elevated as Prime Minister. It was the second-longest continuous period of office of any Chancellor, surpassed only by Nicholas Vansittart two centuries before. Brown's time as Chancellor was marked by major reform of Britain's monetary and fiscal policy architecture, by a wide extension of the powers of the Treasury to cover much domestic policy, and by largely benign economic conditions. =Records= Brown's ten years and two months as Chancellor of the Exchequer set several records. He was the longest-serving Labour Party Chancellor of the Exchequer ever, beating Denis Healey, who was Chancellor for 5 years and 2 months from 5 March 1974 to 4 May 1979. On 15 June 2004, he became the longest continuous serving Chancellor since the Reform Act 1832, passing the figure of 7 years and 43 days set by David Lloyd George (1908‚Äì1915). However, William Ewart Gladstone was Chancellor for a total of 12 years and 4 months in the period from 1852 to 1882 (although not continuously). Brown stated his chancellorship had seen the longest period of sustained economic growth in UK history,\\"Budgeting for stable economic growth\\" although part of this growth period started under the preceding Conservative government in 1993, and the details in Brown's growth figures have been challenged, as have his more general claims to have created the conditions for prosperity and declining poverty levels. =Major acts as Chancellor= Bank of England On taking office as Chancellor, Brown gave the Bank of England operational independence in monetary policy, and thus responsibility for setting interest rates. At the same time, he stripped the Bank of England of its regulatory powers, giving them to the newly created Financial Services Authority, whose board is appointed by the Treasury. Taxation and spending Brown adhered to Labour's 1997 election manifesto pledge not to increase the basic or higher rates of income tax. He reduced the starting rate from 20% (pre-1997) to 10% in 1999, before abolishing the starting rate in 2007; a decision that led to an immense backbench revolt, and reduced the basic rate from 23% (pre-1997) to 22% (2000) and then 20% (2007).Figures from A survey of the UK tax system Adam, S. and J. Browne, Institute for Fiscal Studies, Briefing note No. 9, March 2006 Brown increased the tax thresholds in line with inflation, rather than earnings, which rise more quickly during periods of economic growth. This results in fiscal drag in which more taxpayers are drawn into the upper rates (e.g. in 2000‚Äì01 there were 2,880,000 higher-rate taxpayers, whereas in 2005‚Äì06 there were 3,160,000). In 1997, Brown also introduced taxation of pension funds. Documents subsequently released under the Freedom of Information Act showed that civil servants warned at the time that the move, which generated ¬£5,000,000,000 in tax revenue, could lead to the closure of many occupational schemes, which subsequently came to pass. In 2008, a biographer of Brown, Tom Bower, claimed that Brown had originally sought a larger sum from pension funds, but backed down in the face of opposition.Brown's tax raid on pensions The Metro 26 Oct 2009 In contrast, corporation tax fell under Brown, from a main rate of 33% (pre-1997) to 30% (1999) and then 28% (2007), and from 24% to 19% for small businesses (although the lower rate was set to rise to 22% by 2010). Under Brown, telecom radio frequency auctions gathered ¬£22,500,000,000 for the government. By using a system of sealed bids and only selling a restricted number of licences, they extracted high prices from the telecom operators. Germany at this time applied a similar auction; some allege that these together caused a severe recession in the European telecoms development industry (2001 Telecoms crash) with the loss of 100,000 jobs across Europe, 30,000 of those in the UK.Spectrum pricings uncertain future, Electronics World, Vol 108. September pp.24‚Äì25 But, as Paul Klemperer, one of the designers of the auctions, points out, \\"[t]he United States held no 3G auctions, yet telecoms companies lost just as much: in fact, they lost more.\\" Once the two-year period of following the Conservative's spending plans was over, Brown's 2000 Spending Review outlined a major expansion of government spending, particularly on healthcare and education. In his April 2002 budget, Brown raised National Insurance to pay for increased health spending. Brown has changed tax policy in other ways, such as the introduction of working tax credits. This is one of several ideas borrowed from the US Clinton administration whereby welfare payments are accounted for as negative taxation. The separate means-testing process for tax credits has been criticised by some as bureaucratic, and in 2003‚Äì04 and 2004‚Äì05 problems in the system led to overpayments of ¬£2,200,000,000 and ¬£1,800,000,000 respectively.More get tax credit overpayments BBC News, 31 May 2006 However, economic theory suggests tax credits can strengthen work incentives for those at the margin between employment and unemployment, and the IFS has estimated the reforms brought at least 50,000 single mothers into part-time work.The impact of tax and benefit changes between April 2000 and April 2003 on parents' labour supply Blundell, R., M. Brewer and A. Shepherd, Institute for Fiscal Studies, Briefing Note No. 52, 2004 The Centre for Policy Studies found the poorest fifth of households, which accounted for 6.8% of all taxes in 1996-7, accounted for 6.9% of all taxes paid in 2004-5. Meanwhile, their share of state benefit payouts dropped from 28.1% to 27.1% over the same period.Poor lose out in Brown's tax reforms, The Times 3 September 2006. According to the OECD UK taxation had increased from a 39.3% share of GDP in 1997 to 42.4% in 2006, going to a higher level than Germany.General Government Outlays as percentage of GDP OECD This increase has mainly been attributed to active government policy, and not simply to the growing economy. To have brought this about with only one explicit tax rise has led to accusations of Brown imposing stealth taxes. A commonly reported example resulted in 1997 from a technical change in the way corporation tax is collected, the indirect effect of which was for the dividends on equity investments held within pensions to be taxed, thus lowering pension returns and allegedly contributing to the demise of some pension funds.Brown's raid on pensions costs Britain ¬£100 billion, The Daily Telegraph 16 October 2006. The Treasury contend that this tax change was crucial to long-term economic growth: the existing corporation tax system created biased incentives for corporations to pay out profits as dividends to shareholders (including pension funds, who could then reclaim the tax paid) rather than to reinvest them into company growth (which would result in corporation tax being paid). The old system of corporation tax was widely viewed by economists as a constraint on British economic growth.That pensions raid, Evan Davis 2 April 2007. Growth development and employment Brown pointed to two main accomplishments: growth and employment. An OECD reportOECD Economic Outlook No. 78 Annex Tables ‚Äî Table of Contents OECD shows UK economic growth averaged 2.7% between 1997-2006, higher than the Eurozone's 2.1%, though lower than in any other English-speaking country. UK unemployment is 5.5%,National Statistics Unemployment rate down from 7% in 1997 and lower than the Eurozone's average of 8.1%. In October 1997, Brown took control of the United Kingdom's membership of the European single currency issue by announcing the Treasury would set five economic testsThe five tests The Guardian 29 September 2000 to ascertain whether the economic case had been made. In June 2003, the Treasury indicated the tests had not been passed.UK 'not yet ready for the euro' BBC, 9 June 2003 Between 1999-2002, Brown sold 60% of UK gold reserves at $275 an ounce.HM Treasury review of UK gold reserves sales It was later attacked as a \\"disastrous foray into international asset management\\"Brown's gold sale losses pile up as bullion price surges Scotsman.com website 28 November 2005extrac as he had sold at close to a 20-year low. The UK eventually sold about 395 tons of gold over 17 auctions from July 1999 to March 2002, at an average price of about US$275 per ounce, raising approximately US$3,500,000,000.a b c Gold: Does Gordon Brown's regret selling half of Britain's gold reserves 10 years ago?, The Daily Telegraph, 8 May 2009 By 2011, that quantity of gold would be worth over $19,000,000,000. He pressured the IMF to do the same, but it resisted. Brown believes it is appropriate to remove much of the unpayable Third World debt but does not think all debt should be wiped out. When Labour was re- elected for a third consecutive term at the 2005 general election (though with a vastly reduced majority following the landslide victories at the previous two elections), many MPs spoke of the Labour election victory as being Brown's achievement rather than Blair's; while Blair was facing criticism as Prime Minister for leading the UK into needless wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, Brown was receiving credit for helping secure a strong economy for Britain. On 20 April 2006, in a speech to the United Nations Ambassadors, Brown outlined a \\"Green\\" view of global development: =Other statements and events= Higher education In 2000, Brown started a major political row about higher education (referred to as the Laura Spence Affair) when he accused the University of Oxford of elitism in its admissions procedures. He described the University's decision not to offer a place to state school pupil Laura Spence as \\"absolutely outrageous\\" and implied its decision was based on her background rather than her academic potential. This started a major and hotly argued row in the media in which Oxford strongly denied these accusations. With his comments, Brown can arguably be credited with raising widening participation to higher education up the political agenda. However, many of his opponents said Brown's comments were ill-founded; including Lord Jenkins (then Chancellor of the University of Oxford) who said \\"nearly every fact he used was false,\\" and that Brown's speech had been a \\"little Blitzkrieg in being an act of sudden unprovoked aggression\\". Anti-racism and popular culture During a diplomatic visit to India in January 2007, Brown responded to questions concerning perceived racism and bullying against Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty on the UK reality TV programme Celebrity Big Brother saying, \\"There is a lot of support for Shilpa. It is pretty clear we are getting the message across. Britain is a nation of tolerance and fairness.\\" He later said the debate showed Britain wanted to be \\"defined by being a tolerant, fair and decent country.\\" References Further reading * Ian Nelson, \\"Infinite conditions on the road to peace: the second New Labour government‚Äôs foreign policy approach to the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict after 9/11\\", Contemporary British History, vol. 33, no. 1 (2019), pp. 123‚Äì153.

They can be divided into three types: counts, nest monitoring, and capturing and marking. Basic counts Basic bird counts are a good way to estimate population size, detect changes in population size or species diversity, and determine the cause of the changes if environmental or habitat data is collected as well. Basic bird counts can be completed fairly easily and inexpensively, and they provide general information about the status of a bird population. Birds can be directly counted on breeding colonies, and at roosts, flocks, or Leks. Large diurnal migrants, like many raptors, can be counted as they pass through migration bottlenecks. Small nocturnal migrants are harder to count, but many advances have been made in the use of radar and microphone arrays to identify and count them. =Point counts and area searches= Perhaps the simplest method of counting birds is called a \\"point count\\", in which a trained observer records all the birds seen and heard from a point count station for a set period of time. A series of point counts completed over a fixed route can then be compared to the results of the same point counts in other seasons or years. A similar method, called an area search, involves searching throughout a fixed area for a set amount of time and recording the number of birds seen and heard. Nest monitoring Nest monitoring is essential for measuring the reproductive success of a population, which is important for identifying changes in a population's birth rate. Nests can be found either through systematic searching of the birds‚Äô preferred habitat or by watching birds for behavioral clues. A researcher can then track the success of each nest by regularly checking nests for signs of hatching, fledging, or predation. Nest monitoring can also provide extremely valuable information about nesting behavior, habitat selection, and nest predation. Cameras can be used to study bird to monitor nest and record information about nest survival, nesting behaviors, or even to catch nest predators in the act. The timing of breeding in relation to weather variables can be studied, as well as the size of eggs and chicks in relation to food quality and abundance. Records of habitat variables at each nest provide helpful information on the birds‚Äô nest site selection criteria, and maps of all nests found in a study area allow for examination of how territories are distributed through the habitat. Capturing and marking Capturing and marking birds allows for individuals to be identified whenever or wherever they are captured or seen again. It is a powerful method for studying bird migration, estimating population sizes and survival rates, and recognizing changes in productivity. There are many different ways to capture birds, but the most widely used method is a mist net, a net made of fine nylon mesh which is nearly invisible. Birds fly into the net, becoming entangled, and are extracted by researchers. Birds can then be identified, measured, weighed, and marked with a small aluminum band bearing a unique number. The number is reported to a central database so that information about the bird can be updated if the bird is ever recaptured somewhere else. Birds may also be marked with a locally unique combination of colored plastic leg bands, leg flags, patagial tags, or dyes which allow the bird to be recognized in the field without requiring recapture. Finally, a bird may be outfitted with a radio or satellite transmitter, which enables the bird to be tracked as it moves around within the local landscape or even as it migrates around the world.

Her father was the Doge of Genoa and she had a short marriage due to being widowed in 1607.Widower Virginia Centurione Bracelli (1587-1651) Life Virginia Centurione was born on 2 April 1587 in Genoa and was of noble origins. She was the daughter of Giorgio Centurione (who was the Doge of Genoa from 1621 to 1623) and Lelia Spinola. Despite her desire to live a cloistered life, she was forced into marriage to Gaspare Grimaldi Bracelli, who was a rich noble, on 10 December 1602. She had two daughters: Lelia and Isabella. The marriage did not last long, for she became a widow on 13 June 1607 at the age of 20. She refused another arranged marriage brought on due to her father's influence and took up a vow to live a chaste life. After her husband's death she began charitable works and assisted the poor and the sick. To help alleviate the poverty in her town she founded the \\"Cento Signore della Misericordia Protettrici dei Poveri di Ges√π Cristo\\". The center was soon overrun with people suffering from the famine and plague of 1629‚Äì30 and soon she had to rent the Monte Calvario convent to accommodate all the people that came in. Around 1635 the center was caring for over 300 patients and received recognition as a hospital from the government. Due to declining funds given from the middle and upper classes the institute lost its government recognition in 1647. Bracelli spent the remainder of her life acting as a peacemaker between noble houses and continuing her work for the poor. Bracelli died on 15 December 1651 at the age of 64. Sainthood incorrupt. The informative process for the canonization cause commenced on 28 April 1933 and finished its set business in 1957. Theologians approved all of her writings to be in line and respective of the faith in a decree dated 10 April 1959. Historians were tasked to assess whether the cause had obstacles that would impede it and make the process difficult. But the historians cleared it on 1 December 1971 and allowed for the cause to proceed. The formal introduction of the cause came on 7 January 1977 under Pope Paul VI in which she was accorded the title of Servant of God as the first official stage of the proceedings. An apostolic process was held after this while both processes were validated in Rome so that the Congregation for the Causes of Saints could commence their own investigation. Theologians approved the cause on 18 October 1983 while the C.C.S. approved it on 20 March 1984. On 7 April 1984 she was made Venerable when Pope John Paul II confirmed her heroic virtue.

It was the last masque acted before King James I of England (who died two months later on 27 March), and therefore the final masque of the Jacobean era. The show The masque had, as its theme, the vision of a unified British kingdom under the guidance of a wise king. \\"It reflected perfectly the image that he [James] had tried, in his rough-hewn way, to cultivate -- even if history, in allotting him part of the blame for the catastrophe that was to befall his son, would be less generous to his reputation.\\"Leapman, p. 217. The Fortunate Isles opens with the entrance of Johphiel, \\"an airy spirit\\"Johphiel's costuming has been taken to suggest how such a figure (like Ariel in Shakespeare's The Tempest) would have been portrayed on the Jacobean stage. Johphiel is \\"attired is light silks of several colours, with wings of the same, a bright yellow hair, a chaplet of flowers, blue silk stockings, and pumps, and gloves, with a silver fan in his hand.\\" who is supposedly \\"the intelligence of Jupiter's sphere.\\" Johphiel has a long conversation with Merefool, \\"a melancholic student,\\" which involves much material on the then- new and controversial subject of \\"the brethren of the Rosy Cross.\\" Jonson devotes this masque to his skeptical and satirical view of the Rosicrucians, just as he had taken a similarly jaundiced view of alchemy in his masque of the previous decade, Mercury Vindicated from the Alchemists (1615). A more specifically English cast to the masque comes with the introduction of the two poets John Skelton and Henry Scogan. The English theme is stronger in the anti-masque, which, in addition to generic figures (\\"four knaves\\"), introduces the figures of Mary Ambree, Elinor Rumming, Long Meg of Westminster, and Tom Thumb. Later come the stereotypical mythological figures of the masque form -- in this case, the minor sea gods Proteus, Portunus, and Saron.Portunus and Saron were the ancient Greek gods of ports and navigation, respectively. Inigo Jones's staging featured a floating and moving island (another element that would have appeared in the cancelled masque of the previous year). Though The Fortunate Isles was the major entertainment of the 1624-25 Christmas season at the Stuart Court, Jonson did not hesitate to re-cycle some lyrical passages from the previous year's masque, Neptune's Triumph for the Return of Albion, which had been cancelled due to Court scheduling controversies.Leapman, P. 216. (Jonson would re-use other material from Neptune's Triumph for his next stage play, The Staple of News.) Sources For source material for his text, Jonson relied upon the Speculum Sophicum Rhodo-strautoricum of Teophilus Schweigardt (1618) and the Artis Kabbalisticae of Pierre Morestel (1621).Schuchard, p. 361. The name Johphiel derives from Cornelius Agrippa's De Occulta Philosophia (later translated to English under the title Three Books of Occult Philosophy). Publication The text of The Fortunate Isles was published in quarto soon after its performance in 1625. The quarto is dated \\"1624,\\" since prior to 1751 the English started the New Year on 25 March. [See: Old Style and New Style dates.] The masque was reprinted in the second folio collection of Jonson's works in 1641, and in subsequent editions of the collected works.

He was Bishop of Faisalabad from 1998 to 2012. Pope Francis created Coutts a cardinal on 28 June 2018. Biography Coutts was born in Amritsar, British India on 21 July 1945. He received his religious training at the Christ the King seminary in Karachi and was ordained a priest in Lahore, Pakistan, on 9 January 1971. After ordination, he completed ecclesiastical studies in Rome from 1973 to 1976 and then became professor of philosophy and sociology at Christ the King Regional Seminary, Karachi, rector of St. Mary's Minor Seminary, Lahore, and diocesan vicar general from 1986 to 1988. On 5 May 1988 he was appointed Coadjutor Bishop of Hyderabad in Pakistan by Pope John Paul II and consecrated a bishop on 16 September. He chose as his episcopal motto the word Harmony. He became Bishop of Hyderabad on 1 September 1990. On 27 June 1998 he was appointed Bishop of Faisalabad. Coutts is the longtime Chairman of Caritas Pakistan and directed its earthquake relief efforts in 2005. In Faisalabad he developed ties with Muslim scholars and clerics. The Catholic University of Eichst√§tt-Ingolstadt, Germany, awarded Bishop Coutts the 2007 Shalom Prize for his commitment to interfaith dialogue in Pakistan. For 25 years, the award has been given to people and projects working for human rights. On 25 January 2012, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Bishop Coutts as Archbishop of Karachi to succeed Archbishop Evarist Pinto. Anticipating his return to the city where he had studied and taught, he stressed the challenges posed by the city's refugee-driven population explosion and the \\"sporadic bursts of violence and terrorism\\" that had become a feature of life in Karachi. In both Faisalabad and Karachi, he has campaigned against Pakistan's blasphemy law, which he believes is too easily manipulated for personal attacks or to target religious minorities for insubstantial or pretended offenses. In Karachi he has established multiple connections for inter-religious dialog between Muslims and Catholics, aiming at both acceptance by the general population and increased understanding on the part of political and religious leaders. Coutts was hospitalized with pneumonia and unable to travel to Rome to receive his pallium, the symbol of his status as a metropolitan archbishop, from Pope Benedict in June 2012. He was president of the Pakistan Catholic Bishops' Conference from 2011 to 2017.

The U.S. state of Vermont is home to several breweries, microbreweries, nanobreweries, and brewpubs that produce a wide variety of beer. In 2011, 2012, and 2014, the Brewers Association ranked Vermont as the state with the greatest number of breweries per capita. Using the 2010 US Census population estimate of 625,741 and 26 breweries, there is one brewery for every 24,067 people. The 2012 Brewers Association Economic Impact Report shows Vermont with a total economic impact of beer brewed by craft brewers at $196,287,000. The data places Vermont as third in the category of craft beer industry output per adult (21+) with $418.57 per person. The report states that there are 2,200 full-time employees with an average wage of $30,176. When using the economic impact of beer as a percentage of GDP, Vermont ranks fourth with a percentage of 2.40% for 2012. History The history of beer in Vermont is similar to its history in the rest of the United States ‚Äì no local breweries existed from the late 1800s when Vermont passed its own local prohibition laws, several decades prior to national Prohibition, until the microbrewery explosion of the 1980s and 1990s. Since then a number of strong breweries have developed despite Vermont's small population. =Pre-Prohibition= On November 2, 1798, Vermont passed a law which began restricting sales of strong beer, ale, and cider. This law was eventually overturned on November 10, 1814. However, the temperance movement remained very strong in Vermont. In 1840, tax statistics published by Zadock Thompson show there were one brewery in Vermont producing 12,800 gallons of beer. This brewery was operated in Burlington and went by the name of Burlington Brewery. In 1840, the brewery was completely destroyed when an arson set fire to numerous downtown buildings. The Burlington Brewery was rebuilt and fully operational by late 1841. In 1844, a law was passed which set brewing license fees and appointed county commissioners to approve each license. In 1846, a provision was passed by the legislature to allow a \\"local option\\" to whether grant or deny these licenses. This meant the citizens of the towns could vote on whether to allow or disallow these establishments. In 1850, town selectmen became authorized to approve business license to sell small beer or cider, but not strong beer. In 1852, several more laws were passed which started Vermont's prohibition era. In 1853, the legislature passed the Vermont Prevention of Traffic in Intoxicating Liquors for the Purpose of Drinking law. Licenses published in the Burlington Free Press of January 1863 show only one licensed brewer within Vermont. In 1877, Internal Revenue records show two breweries, one liquor establishment, and 433 saloons. In 1887, the Boston Journal reported that \\"Vermont seems to be the nearest place to paradise for prohibitionists. There is not a brewery in the state.\\" Vermont hop production took off around 1840 and peaked in 1860. In 1840, Vermont produced 48,137 pounds of hops, 292,023 pounds in 1850, 638,657 pounds in 1860, and 527,927 pounds in 1870. Around 1900, there were around 4,400 pounds produced. By 1910, hops production had been reduced to near zero. On January 16, 1919, the 18th Amendment (Federal Prohibition) which outlawed the manufacture, transportation, and sale of alcohol was passed by 3/4 of US states and became law. =Post-Prohibition= On December 5, 1933 Federal Prohibition came to an end. In 1935, two alcoholics from Vermont, Bill Wilson, from East Dorset, and Bob Smith, from St. Johnsbury, started Alcoholics Anonymous with a twelve step program. In 1988, after spending three years lobbying the Vermont legislature to legalize brewpubs Greg Noonan opened the first brewpub in Vermont, the Vermont Pub & Brewery. On the 25th Anniversary of the Vermont Pub & Brewery, the city of Burlington dedicated a plaque commemorating Noonan at the front of the pub. In 1997 Wolaver's Fine Organic Ales became the first certified organic brewery in the United States. In 2014, Wolaver's (now owned by Otter Creek Brewing Company) became the first non-GMO certified brewery in Vermont. Due to proximity, distribution, and availability of beer produced by these three brewers, the town of Waterbury was named the Best Beer Town in New England by the Boston Globe in 2012. Beer regulations and laws Within Vermont statutes, beer is defined as a \\"malt beverage\\" containing \\"not less than one percent nor more than 16 percent of alcohol by volume at 60 degrees Fahrenheit.\\" An exception to the law provides that any beverage with an alcohol content of \\"more than six percent and has a terminal specific gravity of less than 1.009\\" which is considered a spirit and not a malt beverage. A \\"specialty beer\\" is defined as a malt beverage that contains \\"more than eight percent alcohol and not more than 16 percent alcohol by volume at 60 degrees Fahrenheit\\". Holders of first and third class licenses may sell malt beverages between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 2:00 a.m. the next morning. Holders of second class licenses may sell malt between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 12:00 a.m. the next morning. A person may import or transport not more than six gallons of malt or vinous beverages providing it is not for resale. It is illegal to serve more than 32 ounces of beer at a time which prevents sales of normal 64 oz pitchers of beer. Beer styles =Black IPA= Greg Noonan, owner and head brewer of The Vermont Pub & Brewery, and Glenn Walter, then an assistant brewer, are cited with creating the Black IPA (AKA Cascadian Dark Ale, India Black Ale, or Vermont Porter) with the initial brewing of Blackwatch IPA on December 4, 1994.Black and Bitter, True Origins of Black IPA The Blackwatch IPA second brewing was November 25, 1995, where Noonan was assisted by John Kimmich, who is now the owner and brewer of The Alchemist. This beer inspired John Kimmich's (The Alchemist) El Jefe Black IPA (2003) and Shaun Hill's (then Shed Restaurant & Brewery) Darkside Black IPA and later Hill Farmstead's James. Mitch Steele, head brewer of Stone Brewing Co., states the Darkside Black IPA was the inspiration for Stone's Sublimely Self Righteous Ale. =Vermont IPA= The Alchemist, Hill Farmstead Brewery, and Lawson's Finest Liquids have created a loosely named beer India Pale Ale (IPA) category called \\"East Coast IPAs\\" or \\"New England IPAs\\". In 2012, Jeff Baker wrote \\"The Case for the Vermont IPA.\\"Hops & Barly: The Case for the Vermont IPA In 2013, Gary Dzen of the Boston Globe called the style \\"East Coast IPAs\\", but noted that Vermont \\"brewers have started something of their own IPA revolution, helping to loosely create the category of 'East Coast IPAs'. While these beers can be as bitter as their counterparts out west, they're generally less so, focusing on aromatics and perceived bitterness rather than actual pucker-factor. These brews are heavily dry-hopped and lighter on the palate, forgoing malt sweetness for levity in the quest for balance.\\" In 2014, Jeff Baker restated his case, saying Vermont IPAs are \\"bright golden and hazy (unfiltered typically) in appearance, soft in mouthfeel, dense with hop flavor and aroma, yet restrained in bitterness allowing for balance to occur between the hops and the malt.\\" Beers Magic Hat Brewing Company's #9 in a mug One of the most widely known beers from Vermont is #9 from Magic Hat Brewing Company. #9 is an apricot-flavored fruit beer based on a traditional pale ale. Heady Topper from The Alchemist is only sold in Vermont as of January 2014. Heady Topper is a double India Pale Ale and is one of the highest rated beers on both BeerAdvocate and RateBeer. Other beers, such as Hill Farmstead's Edward and Abner and Lawson's Finest Liquids Double Sunshine IPA, have gained national acclaim. Breweries As of May 2019, there were 56 operating production breweries and brewpubs operating in Vermont. Two Vermont brewers have been awarded the Brewers Association Russell Schehrer Award for Innovation in Craft Brewing. Steve Parkes, owner of the American Brewers Guild and Drop-In Brewery in Middlebury, won the award in 2009.Brewers Association 2009 Achievement Award Winners Greg Noonan, owner of Vermont Pub & Brewery, won the award in 2005. In 1996, Jigger Hill Brewery, which used the \\"Tunbridge Quality Ales\\" brand name, was opened by Liz Trott and her partner Janice Moran. Trott became the first female head brewer in Vermont and the first Vermont brewer to distribute bottle conditioned beer. This was also the first woman-owned, lesbian-owned brewery in Vermont, and one of the first within the United States. In 2000, the partners helped reformulate and re-launch Gay Pride Beer for J. Lewis Company. In May 2002, the brewery closed due to one of the partners' health complications. In 2011, Hill Farmstead Brewery was named the 2011 Best New Brewer in the World by RateBeer. In 2013, Hill Farmstead Brewery was named the 2013 Best Brewery in the World, Best Brewery in Vermont, and Best Brewery in New England by RateBeer. Additionally, Alchemist Heady Topper was named the Best Beer in Vermont for 2012. In 2014, Hill Farmstead Brewery was named the 2014 Best Brewery in Vermont, Alchemist Heady Topper was named the 2014 Best Beer in Vermont, and Lost Nation Brewery was named the 2014 Best New Brewery in Vermont. In 2015, Hill Farmstead Brewery was named the Best Brewery in the World by RateBeer. The Alchemist, Hill Farmstead, and Lawson's Finest Liquids have become so popular that the route that leads between the three breweries is called the IPA Highway and is a popular destination for beer enthusiasts. =Craft breweries= According to the Vermont Brewers Association, as of May 2019, there were 56 breweries operating in Vermont that could be described as craft breweries. *14th Star Brewery ‚Äì St. AlbansHirsch, Corin (May 15, 2013). \\"14th Star Brewing Brings Craft Beer to St. Albans\\", Seven Days.

During their stay, King Dharmaraja and his mother Kunthi Devi sanctified the idols of Sri Tripurantaka Swamy and Sri Janardhana Swamy, at this place. About five hundred years ago the local people unearthed an idol of Sri Madhava Swamy while quarrying for sandstone on the nearby rocky knoll. They installed it in between the earlier two temples and built a third temple named after Sri Venugopalaswamy (another name of Lord Krishna). The twin Jammi trees at the Tripurtantaka Swamy temple are considered to be holy and have miraculous healing properties. The temple is in existence at least for a thousand years as per the stone inscription on site. Modern day geologists have estimated that the Shivalinga extends more than 179 feet deep into the earth.

He played four seasons in the North American Soccer League and was a member of the U.S. soccer team at the 1972 Summer Olympics. Youth Seerey was a standout U.S. collegiate soccer player at St. Louis University where he starred for the school's men's soccer team from 1969 to 1972. During his four years with the Billikens, the team won the NCAA championship three times. In 1971, Seerey was a first team All American. He also won the Hermann Trophy as the top collegiate player of the year. Ironically, he was named the NCAA Tournament's Offensive MVP although this was the only year St. Louis did not win the championship during Seerey's four seasons. Seerey repeated as the Hermann Trophy winner in 1972, making him the second two-time winner after fellow St. Louis teammate Al Trost. However, he was not named to the All American list his senior year. As of 2007, he is ranked fourth on season points list at St. Louis with 55 in the 1971 season. Olympics In addition to playing collegiate soccer, Seerey was also a member of the 1972 U.S. Olympic soccer team. He began playing with the Olympic team while in 1971 while still in college. That year, the team went 3‚Äì2‚Äì2 in first-round qualifications. In 1972, the U.S. qualified for its first Olympics in twelve years. Seerey scored two goals in a 2‚Äì0 victory over Guatemala and another two goals in a 2‚Äì2 tie with Mexico. The U.S. finished the second round qualifications with a 2-1-3 record and a berth in the 1972 Summer Olympics. Seerey started and played all 90 minutes in the first two U.S. games at the Olympics. In the first game, the U.S. held Morocco scoreless in a 0‚Äì0 tie. However, the next game brought the team back to Earth as Malaysia easily won 3‚Äì0. The U.S. coach sent out his reserves for the last game against host West Germany and Seerey watched his teammates get humbled 7‚Äì0. Professional After the Olympics, Seerey turned pro with the Miami Toros of the North American Soccer League (NASL). The Toros selected him in the first round (second overall) of the 1973 NASL draft. He played 14 games and scored 3 goals, adding 4 assists. The next year, he moved to the Saint Louis Stars, also of the NASL, where he played for the next three years. He never found his scoring touch with the Stars and when he retired from the NASL after the 1976 season, he had only scored 1 goal in 43 games with that team.

Along with the NWS's global forecast system (GFS), which runs out to 16 days, the ECMWF's Integrated Forecast System (IFS), which runs out 10 days, the Naval Research Laboratory Navy Global Environmental Model (NAVGEM), which runs out eight days, and the UK Met Office's Unified Model, which runs out to six days, it is one of the five predominant synoptic scale medium-range models in general use.  Operation  = Deterministic model = The GEM's operational model, known as the global deterministic prediction system (GDPS), is currently operational for the global data assimilation cycle and medium-range forecasting, the regional data assimilation spin-up cycle and short-range forecasting. Mesoscale forecasts (distributed under the names regional deterministic prediction system or RDPS for the coarser mesh and high- resolution deterministic prediction system or HRDPS for the finer mesh) are produced overnight and are available to the operational forecasters. A growing number of meteorological applications are now either based on or use the GEM model. Output from the GEM goes out to 10 days, on par with the public output of the European Integrated Forecast System. = Ensemble model = The ensemble variant of the GEM is known as the Global Ensemble Prediction System (GEPS). It has 20 members (plus control) and runs out 16 days, the same range as the American global forecast system. The GEPS runs alongside the GFS ensemble to form the North American Ensemble Forecast System. A regional ensemble prediction system (REPS), covering North America and also having 20 members plus control, runs out 72 hours.  Development  The GEM model has been developed to meet the operational weather forecasting needs of Canada for the coming years. These presently include short-range regional forecasting, medium-range global forecasting, and data assimilation. In the future they will include nowcasting at the meso-scales, and dynamic extended-range forecasting on monthly to seasonal timescales. The essence of the approach is to develop a single highly efficient model that can be reconfigured at run time to either run globally at uniform-resolution (with possibly degraded resolution in the \\"other\\" hemisphere), or to run with variable resolution over a global domain such that high resolution is focused over an area of interest. = Mechanics = The operational GEM model dynamics is formulated in terms of the hydrostatic primitive equations with a terrain following pressure vertical coordinate (h). The time discretization is an implicit two-time-level semi- Lagrangian scheme. The spatial discretization is a Galerkin grid-point formulation on an Arakawa C-grid in the horizontal (lat-lon) and an unstaggered vertical discretization. The horizontal mesh can be of uniform or variable resolution, and furthermore can be arbitrarily rotated, the vertical mesh is also variable. The explicit horizontal diffusion is -2 on all prognostic variables. The operational GEM model is interfaced with a full complement of physical parametrizations, these currently include: * solar and infrared radiation interactive with water vapor, carbon dioxide, ozone and clouds, * prediction of surface temperature over land with the force-restore method, * turbulence in the planetary boundary layer through vertical diffusion, diffusion coefficients based on stability and turbulent kinetic energy, * surface layer based on Monin‚ÄìObukhov similarity theory, * shallow convection scheme (non precipitating), * Kuo-type deep convection scheme (global forecast system), * Fritsch‚ÄìChappell type deep convection scheme (regional forecast system), * Sundqvist condensation scheme for stratiform precipitation, * Gravity wave drag. = Future = The next stage of development of the GEM model is to evaluate the non-hydrostatic version for mesoscale applications where the hydrostatic assumption breaks down. The limited-area (open-boundary) version is scheduled to follow. The distributed memory version of GEM is almost completed, it is a major recoding effort that is based upon a locally developed communication interface currently using Message Passing Interface. Research on the performance of different land surface schemes such as ISBA (Interaction Soil-Biosphere-Atmosphere) and CLASS (Canadian Land Surface Scheme) is making progress. The strategy is progressing towards a unified data assimilation and forecast system, at the heart of which lies a single multipurpose and multiscale numerical model.

UMBC Chess The UMBC chess team has won Pan-American Championships against fields with dozens of teams, including Ivy League institutions and other top competitors. Through 2002, the team had proven dominant in winning the Pan-American Intercollegiate Chess Championship six out of seven years. However, in the two following years it was upset in the tournament by its chief rival in chess, UT-Dallas. In 2005, UMBC defeated UT-Dallas en route to its third consecutive Final Four of College Chess. However, with this success certain aspects of the program have also drawn scrutiny. It has been reported that UMBC is only one of two schools (along with UT-Dallas) in the United States to offer major scholarship packages for chess proficiency, and was cited as a potential motivator in a WSJ article discussing the potential for firmer guidelines on eligibility for collegiate chess. The university hosted the 2006 Pan American Chess Championships, which were held at the Washington, D.C. Renaissance Hotel in late December. The team's most recent achievement was a third-place finish in the 2013 President's Cup behind UT-Dallas and the winners from Webster University in St. Louis.http://www.retrieverweekly.com/news/umbc-chess-team- finishes-third-in-president-s-cup-1.3028321#.UZZVsaIp8i0  UMBC Mock Trial  UMBC Mock Trial began competing in 2011 within the American Mock Trial Association (AMTA), which governs intercollegiate Mock Trial. In 2015, UMBC Mock Trial earned the team's first bid to the Opening Round Championship Series (ORCS), which is the second level of sanctioned playoffs within AMTA. The team returned to ORCS in 2016, and advanced two teams to ORCS in 2017 and 2018. In 2017, UMBC Mock Trial earned their first ever bid to the AMTA National Championship Tournament, and finished in fourth place in the \\"A\\" division at the Yale University Mock Trial Invitational. During the 2018-19 competitive season, UMBC Mock Trial won two invitational tournaments, finishing 7-1 at the Duke University Tobacco Road Invitational, and finishing a perfect 8-0 at the Georgetown University Hilltop Invitational. UMBC Mock Trial then earned their fifth consecutive bid to ORCS, and advanced to the 2019 AMTA National Championship Tournament. At the 2019 AMTA National Championship Tournament, UMBC earned their first top-ten finish in program history, finishing in eighth place in the Dr. Frank Guliuzza Division. In 2016, UMBC Mock Trial co-hosted their first invitational tournament, the First Annual Charm City Classic Mock Trial Invitational, and co-hosted the Classic again in 2017. UMBC took sole ownership over the Classic in 2018 and hosted the third iteration of the tournament in October at the University of Maryland School of Law. In 2018, UMBC Mock Trial co-hosted their first AMTA Regional Tournament, along with Stevenson University. In 2019, UMBC and Stevenson co- hosted an AMTA Regional Tournament again.

It is served by the Cascades and Coast Starlight trains. The track and platforms are owned by BNSF Railway. Local transit connections are provided by Twin Transit. History The station was constructed by the Northern Pacific Railway (NP) and opened in 1912. It is the third station to have been constructed in Centralia since rail service began in 1880. The large brick structure was built to accommodate a 400% population boom in the area from 1900-1914. Only 2 years after its opening, Centralia Union Depot was being served by 44 passenger trains and 17 freight trains daily. The station faced 14 hotels along Tower Avenue, as well as 5 theaters and 8 banks in the downtown core. NP later merged into the Burlington Northern Railroad (BN) in 1970, and Amtrak began operating passenger rail service on the Seattle‚ÄìPortland route on May 1, 1971. Amtrak trains initially did not stop in Centralia, but were added during a service change on July 12, 1971. The demise of NP, coupled with increased automobile traffic on Interstate 5 saw the Centralia Union Depot deteriorate, much as the city's downtown core was experiencing economic decline. Local civic leaders recognized the problem during the mid-1980s and began a two-decade project that would see the structure acquired by the city and restored as part of a larger downtown revitalization project. The 1996 merger of BN with the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway to form the BNSF Railway (BNSF) spurred both the city and the state Department of Transportation (Rail Branch) to negotiate with BNSF to acquire the depot. Following its purchase, the city began the design process for the historic restoration which took place as follows: * Phase 1 (1996) consisted of exterior work. Stabilize structure deterioration, restore roof dormers that had been removed, install new tile roof, re-point brick exterior, new utilities, new parking lots at each end of the building. * Phase 2 (2000) consisted of interior work. New floors, restored mill work and brass fittings, Amtrak ticket office, baggage room, freight room, express building, HVAC, elevator. The restoration project was completed in April 2002 and celebrated in the city's \\"Railroad Days\\" festival. The depot is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

He traveled extensively among them to share agricultural products and build relations, as well as to promote trade. According to one source, the influence of Manuel Lisa, exerted from Fort Lisa, was strong enough to hold all the Missouri River Indians firmly in alliance with the United States during the War of 1812. He organized war expeditions from Fort Lisa against tribes on the Mississippi River allied with the British. During the same period he secured the allegiance of tribes along the northern Missouri River.Chittenden, H. M. and Swagerty, W. R. (1986) The American Fur Trade of the Far West, University of Nebraska Press, p. 128 In 1819 the first steamboat to ply the Missouri River, the Western Engineer, piloted by Stephen Harriman Long, arrived at the fort. Aboard the ship were General Henry Atkinson and Captain Stephen Watt Kearny, both important to the future development of the American West. Later forts in the Nebraska Territory were named after them: Fort Atkinson and Fort Kearny. Lisa spent the winter of 1819-20 at Fort Lisa with his third wife, Mary Hempstead Keeney. That winter at the fort, they had the company of Major Stephen H.

Fort Lisa likely influenced the positioning of several nearby historically significant sites. In competition, the American Fur Company established Cabanne's Trading Post two and one-half miles south in 1822. The proximity of the posts, along with Fort Atkinson, in turn influenced the positioning of Cutler's Park, the Mormon Bridge, Fort Omaha, and Florence. These establishments attracted the flow of Mormon Trail pioneers, which in turn led to the development of Kanesville, Omaha, Saratoga, and eventually all of North Omaha, as well as many further points in the western expansion of the United States.(n.d.) \\"Chapter 4: Council Bluffs and Winter Quarters: 1846-1847\\", in Mormon Pioneer Historic Resource Study, National Park Service, Retrieved 8/6/08 See also *Cabanne's Trading Post *Engineer Cantonment *Fort Atkinson *Winter Quarters *History of North Omaha, Nebraska *Landmarks in North Omaha, Nebraska *Louisiana Purchase *Nebraska Territory *Timeline of North Omaha, Nebraska history References External links * 1902 photo of the site of Fort Lisa Landmarks in North Omaha, Nebraska Trading posts in Nebraska History of United States expansionism Missouri River 1812 establishments in the United States Buildings and structures in Omaha, Nebraska Archaeological sites in Nebraska Lisa Pre-statehood history of Nebraska Forts along the Missouri River ","title":"Fort Lisa (Nebraska)"},{"id":"9746930","text":"KPAY-FM (93.9 FM) is a commercial radio station located in Chico, California.

The building was designed and built by the \\"Chief Kyiv Project\\" architects group led by Vadym Hopkalo, with assistance by Vadym Hrechyna, Volodymyr Kolomiyets, and Leonid Filenko. In 1985 the authors of the project received the Shevchenko State Prize of the Ukrainian SSR. Since 1938 the Kyiv city exhibition of the All-Union Lenin Museum was located in Teacher House at 57 Volodymyr Street. The museum was moved to the Ukrainian House building when it was opened in 1982, where it remained until after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. On April 2, 1993 the building was renamed and converted to a conference and exhibition hall. The Lenin museum exhibition was dismounted and placed into storage funds. In 2004 the entire collection of the Museum of the History of Kyiv was moved from its location at the Klov Palace to the fourth and fifth floor of Ukrainian House, where much of the collection remains to this day.

Background  Gillette was born in Montana, but spent part of his childhood in Spokane, Washington. His parents were financially comfortable, but deeply religious, and eventually renounced material wealth to join The Salvation Army. The family traveled around the United States West Coast and to Hawaii during his adolescence. Chester never took to the religious aspects of his upbringing. He attended Oberlin College's preparatory school on the generosity of a wealthy uncle, but left after two years in 1903. After leaving school, he worked at odd jobs until 1905 when he took a position at an uncle's skirt factory in Cortland, New York.  Murder of Grace Brown  Grace Brown At the factory, Gillette met Grace Brown, another employee. Gillette and Brown soon began a sexual relationship, with Brown assuming Gillette would marry her. In the spring of 1906, Brown revealed that she was pregnant. She continued to pressure Gillette to marry her, often writing him pleading letters. Brown then returned to her parents' home for a time, but returned to Cortland when she discovered that Gillette had been courting other girls. One popular story involved Miss Harriet Benedict, a wealthy acquaintance of Gillette who the newspapers later speculated was the \\"other woman\\" for whom Chester had left Grace. Harriet heatedly denied this, going so far as to issue a formal press release proclaiming: \\"I have never been engaged to Chester E. Gillette ... Our acquaintance was of ... a limited duration, and ... not a word or suggestion was ever made between us [about an engagement].\\" As the spring and summer of 1906 progressed, others noticed an increasing frequency of Gillette's raised voice and Brown's tears at the factory or at each other's homes. Brown continued to press Gillette for some kind of decision, and Gillette played for time with vague statements about their future and of their going away on a trip sometime soon. Finally, Gillette made arrangements for a trip to the Adirondack Mountains in upstate New York. The pair stayed for a night in Utica, New York, and then continued to Tupper Lake in Franklin County, spending the night. Rain the next day ruined their plans for an outing on a nearby lake, so they returned south to Big Moose Lake in Herkimer County. At the lakeside Glenmore hotel, Gillette registered under a false name (although one that used his own initials to match the monogram on his suitcase). He was carrying one suitcase and a tennis racquet. Brown, at this point, may have expected some kind of elopement ceremony. On July 11, Gillette took Brown in a rowboat on Big Moose Lake, where he clubbed her with his tennis racquet and left her to drown. An overturned boat was found floating in the lake, together with Gillette's hat, leading authorities initially to believe both had drowned. Meanwhile, Gillette, carrying a suitcase, hiked through the woods to Fulton Chain Lakes, where he checked into the Arrowhead hotel under his real name. Later, witnesses said that Gillette seemed calm, collected, and perfectly at ease; nothing seemed to be amiss. Brown's body was found at the bottom of the lake the next day. An autopsy revealed she had suffered major head trauma, turning an accidental drowning case into a murder investigation. Gillette had done a poor job of planning the cover-up, and was quickly arrested in nearby Inlet, New York.  Trial and execution  The trial took place in Herkimer County, and quickly drew nationwide attention. Gillette's uncle refused to pay for his defense. Court appointed attorneys claimed that their client was innocent, that Brown had committed suicide, and that Gillette was a helpless onlooker to the suicide. It did not help that Gillette had changed his story - claiming he wasn't there when Brown drowned, then accidental drowning, then suicide. He also had a hard time explaining to the jury Brown's injuries, why he took his suitcase on a boat ride, and how it ended up dry even though the boat overturned. The jury convicted Gillette of murder. The New York Appeals Court upheld the verdict, and Governor Charles Evans Hughes refused to grant clemency or give a reprieve. On March 30, 1908, Chester Gillette was executed by electric chair at Auburn Prison in Auburn, New York. The case was officially reported as People v. Gillette, 191 N.Y. 107, 83 N.E. 680 (1908).  In recent years  The television series Unsolved Mysteries aired an episode about the historical incident of Gillette and Brown in January 1996. In 2007, Gillette's diary, which he wrote during the last seven months he was in prison, was donated to the Hamilton College Library by Gillette's grandniece. In addition to the diary, 12 letters written by Gillette during his time in prison also were donated. Eleven of the letters were addressed to Bernice Ferrin, a friend of the family who moved to Auburn, New York to stay with Gillette's sister Hazel. The twelfth letter, a farewell letter written the day before his execution, was addressed to Hazel Gillette. The diary and letters were published in December 2007, almost 100 years after the execution of Chester Gillette.

(2003) \\"Karate Pioneer Kentsu Yabu, 1866-1937.\\" Following separation from the service, Yabu studied at Shuri's Prefectural Teacher's Training College, and in 1902, he became a teacher at Shuri's Prefectural School Number One.Noble, Graham, with McLaren, Ian and Karasawa, N. (1988). \\"Masters of the Sh≈çrin-ry≈´, Part II,\\" Fighting Arts International, 51, 9:3, 1988, pp. 32-35. In 1908, Yabu's oldest son, Kenden, went to Hawaii. In 1912, Kenden went to California. In the USA, Kenden Yabu became known as Kenden Yabe, after a method of transliteration then being used on Japanese passports.History of the Okinawans in North America, translation of Hokubei Okinawajin shi, translated by Ben Kobashigawa. Los Angeles: University of California and the Okinawan Club of America, 1988. In 1919, Kenden Yabe married, and in 1921, his wife became pregnant. Yabu Kentsu immediately went to California to visit his son (and, hopefully, grandson). However, Kenden Yabe and his wife only had daughters. Thus, Yabu Kentsu went back to Okinawa disappointed. Yabu visited the United States twice, once during 1921-1922, and again in 1927. During the second visit, he returned to Okinawa via Hawaii. He spent about nine months in the Territory. He spent most of his time on Oahu, but he also visited other islands. In Honolulu, he gave two public demonstrations of karate at the Nuuanu YMCA.Goodin, Charles.

Black, 1989, p. 86. Yabu died at Shuri, Okinawa, on August 27, 1937.  Influence on Karate  As a former soldier, Yabu has been credited with helping make Okinawan karate training more militaristic. That is, students were expected to line up in rows, and respond by the numbers. If so, this was probably part of the general militarization of Japanese athletics common during the early 20th century.Abe, Ikuo, Kiyohara, Yasuharu, and Nakajima, Ken. \\"Sport and Physical Education under Fascistization in Japan,\\" Bulletin of Health & Sport Sciences, University of Tsukuba, 13, 1990, pp. 25-46.

She was arrested by the Bolsheviks and shot to death outside Perm in the autumn of 1918. Like the Romanovs and their servants who were killed on 17 July 1918, Hendrikova and Catherine Adolphovna Schneider, the elderly court tutor who was killed with her, were canonized as martyrs by the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia in 1981. Biography Hendrikova, who was nicknamed \\"Nastenka,\\" was the daughter of Count Vassili Alexandrovich Hendrikov, Grand Master of Ceremonies of the Imperial Court, and his wife, Princess Sophia Petrovna Gagarine. She was a descendant of the sister of Catherine I of Russia, the wife of Peter the Great. Hendrikova was appointed a lady of waiting in 1910. She acted as a \\"sort of unofficial governess\\" to the four grand duchesses.King, Greg, and Wilson, Penny, The Fate of the Romanovs, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 2003, p. 51 =Exile and death= From left to right: Catherine Schneider, Count Ilya Tatishchev, Pierre Gilliard, Anastasia Hendrikova and Prince Vasily Dolgorukov Hendrikova was devoted to the Romanov family and followed them into exile after the Russian Revolution of 1917, going with them first to Tobolsk and later to Ekaterinburg, even though she was worried about her own family. Hendrikova's sister Alexandra Balashova, nicknamed \\"Inotchka,\\" was ill with tuberculosis. \\"The two sisters were all the world to each other,\\" wrote her fellow lady in waiting, Baroness Sophie von Buxhoeveden, recalling how Hendrikova's \\"dark eyes glowed\\" when she heard news about her sister. \\"And it was from Inotchka's bedside that Nastenka had rushed back to Tsarskoe Selo on the news of the revolution to join the empress in her danger. Now she seldom had news.\\" Buxhoeveden thought Hendrikova was aware of the danger that she was in. Hendrikova had \\"so fixed her thoughts on approaching death that it had no terror for her,\\" Buxhoeveden wrote in her memoirs. \\"She was very pretty and looked younger than her twenty-eight years, but she welcomed the thought of death, so weary had she become of life and so much detached from earthly interests. I felt her drifting away to higher planes.\\"King and Wilson, p. 144 Hendrikova was forcibly separated by the Bolsheviks from the Romanov family at Ekaterinburg and imprisoned in Perm for some months. =Account of death= On 4 September 1918, Hendrikova and Schneider were taken from their prison cell and led to the prison office along with Aleksei Volkov, a sixty-year-old valet in the household of the Tsar. They were joined by eight other prisoners, including the chambermaid from the house where Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia had lived. They had an escort of twenty-two guards, none of them Russian. Volkov, who later escaped, recalled that when he asked a guard where they were being taken, he was told they were being taken \\"to the house of arrest.\\" Hendrikova, who had been in the washroom, asked a guard the same question when she came out. She was told they were being taken \\"to the central prison.\\" Hendrikova asked him, \\"and from there?\\" The guard replied, \\"Well! to Moscow.\\" Hendrikova repeated this conversation to her fellow prisoners and made the sign of the cross with her fingers.

After a while another sailor said, \\"Let's go.\\" They lined the prisoners up in the street in rows of two, the men in front and the women in back. The group walked all the way to the edge of town and onto the Simbirsk road. Volkov asked another prisoner where the central prison was and was told they had long passed it. Volkov realized they were being taken into the woods to be shot. Volkov broke from the group and ran for his life at the first opportunity. A bullet whizzed past his ear. Behind him he heard gunshots as the other prisoners in the group, among them Hendrikova, were shot and killed.King and Wilson, p. 504 The bodies of Hendrikova and Schneider were recovered by the Whites in May 1919,Rappaport, p. 377 and were reburied in the Yegoshikha Cemetery.

Its publication was one of the first to focus on poor, working-class blacks following the enactment of the British Nationality Act 1948 alongside George Lamming's The Emigrants (1954). Overview The book details the life of West Indians in post-World War II London, a city the immigrants consider the \\"centre of the world.\\"Samuel Selvon, The Lonely Londoners, p. 134. Covering a period of roughly three years, The Lonely Londoners has no plot in the usual sense of the term. Rather, the novel follows a limited number of characters of the \\"Windrush generation\\", all of them \\"coloureds\\", through their daily lives in the capital. The various threads of action form a whole through the unifying central character of Trinidadian Moses Aloetta, a veteran √©migr√© who, after more than ten years in London, has still not achieved anything of note and whose homesickness increases as he gets older. Every Sunday morning \\"the boys\\", many a recent arrival among them, come together in his rented room to trade stories and inquire after those whom they have not seen for a while. Not surprisingly, their lives mainly consist of work (or looking for a job) and various petty pleasures. Social commentary A recurring theme in Selvon's character development addresses upward social mobility. This mobility, however, is clouded by the character's designation as the \\"other\\". Selvon's characters are offered the worst jobs, they are exploited by housing landlords, and romance for these characters oftentimes only includes sex. Their accents and skin colour mark them as outsiders and force them to form a group identity based on the principle of congregation via segregation. This analysis allows the reader to better understand the self-hate, disappointment, and struggle that haunts Selvon's characters. The protagonist, Moses, describes London as a lonely city that \\"divide[s] up in little worlds, and you stay in the world where you belong to and you don't know anything about what is happening in the other ones except what you read in the papers.\\"Selvon: The Lonely Londoners, p. 60. Against a backdrop of invisibility, many of the characters struggle with a sense of failed promise. By looking at the various coping mechanisms: sex, lavish spending, drinking, hard work, appeasing white women, etc., the author ultimately conveys the unity in their experience. Regardless of their actions, a certain sense of stagnancy prevails. Moses says: \\"...I just lay there on the bed thinking about my life, how after all these years I ain't get no place at all, I still the same way, neither forward nor backward.\\"Selvon, The Lonely Londoners, p. 113. Helon Habila has noted: \\"One imagines immediately the loneliness that must have gnawed at these immigrants whose memory of their sunny, convivial island communities was their only refuge at such moments. But although this is a book about exile and alienation, it is not a sad book. Even when his characters are under-going the direst of tribulations, Selvon has a way of capturing the humour in the situation.... The message of The Lonely Londoners is even more vital today than in 50s Britain: that, although we live in societies increasingly divided along racial, ideological and religious lines, we must remember what we still have in common - our humanity.\\"Helon Habila, \\"Out of the Shadows\\", The Guardian, 17 March 2007. Retrieved 7 August 2007. Narrative technique, language and style The most striking feature of The Lonely Londoners is its narrative voice. Selvon started writing the novel in standard English but soon found out that such language would not aptly convey the experiences and the unarticulated thoughts and desires of his characters.Susheila Nasta, \\"Introduction\\" to Sam Selvon, The Lonely Londoners (Penguin Books: London, 2006), p. vi. In creating a third person narrator who uses the same creolized form of English as the characters of the novel, Selvon added a new, multiculturalist dimension to the traditional London novel and enhanced the awareness in both readers and writers of a changing London society which could no longer be ignored. Thus, in style and context, The Lonely Londoners \\"represented a major step forward in the process of linguistic and cultural decolonization.\\" Nasta, \\"Introduction\\" to The Lonely Londoners (Penguin, 2006), p. x. The language used by Selvon's characters and by the narrator contains a multitude of slang expressions. For example, when \\"the boys\\" talk about \\"the Water\\" or \\"the Gate\\", they are referring to Bayswater and Notting Hill respectively. (Unlike today, the Notting Hill area evoked a down-at-heel area of cheap lodgings where Caribbean immigrants could more easily find accommodation than elsewhere in London, but be victims of practices like Rachmanism.) Sometimes referring to themselves and each other as \\"spades\\", in their spare time they can be found \\"liming\\"--the Caribbean pastime of hanging around with friends eating, talking and drinking--and some of their talk will be \\"oldtalk\\", reminiscences of their previous lives in the West Indies and the exchange of news from home. Finally, a white English girl can be a \\"skin\\" (\\"a sharp piece of skin\\"), a \\"frauline\\" [sic], a \\"cat\\", a \\"number\\", or of course a \\"chick\\" or \\"white pussy\\". A remarkable passage within the novel about a typical London summer is written in the stream-of-consciousness mode, linking up Selvon with the modernist movement.Selvon, The Lonely Londoners, pp. 92‚Äì102.

The building itself is kept isolated - the federal government owns the property behind the building, and no other government tenants are near the facility. After the Oklahoma City bombing, where a federal building was destroyed by explosives, the federal government has taken care to isolate sensitive archived records and documents away from other government agencies. The building houses over 200 million records from 110 different United States federal agencies, as well as 10,000 records from federal courts of the Pacific Sierra region. Records staffers make over 100,000 photocopies per year. It would take 40 people approximately 100 years to microfilm all of the records currently available at the National Archives and Records Administration division of the Leo J. Ryan Federal Building. As of 1998, the budget for the Pacific Sierra Region of the National Archives and Records Administration was USD$1,000,000 per year, and annual visits to the archives numbered over 15,800. The building is specifically designed for the archiving of government documents - it is isolated, fireproof, and climate-controlled..

His recent work concentrates on computational fluid dynamics and contemporary data collection, retention and visualization, particularly as they pertain to the future's ecology.

The engagement took place from 5 February to 1 April 1941, between a mixed Italian army of regular and colonial troops and British troops (mostly from Sudan and British India) and Free French forces. The town of Keren, in the colony of Italian East Africa, was of tactical importance to both sides in 1941. The road and railway through Keren were the main routes to the colonial capital at Asmara and the Red Sea port of Massawa, which surrendered to the British after the battle. Background =Eritrea= Italian East Africa, May 1940, before the conquest of British Somaliland Colonised by the Italians in 1885, Italian Eritrea was used as a staging ground for Italian invasions of the Ethiopian Empire in the First and Second Italo-Abyssinian Wars. The second invasion began in 1935 and Ethiopia fell in 1936. Ethiopia, Italian Somaliland and Eritrea were combined to form Italian East Africa (Africa Orientale Italiana) part of the Italian Empire. Following the Italian declaration of war on 10 June 1940, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini ordered his troops to capture the British Somaliland and border towns in the Sudan and Kenya. Eritrea has three climate zones, a coastal region, with a sandy plain and low scrub running inland for in the east with elevations of up to , which is hot and humid for most of the year, with June, September and October the hottest months. At Massawa the average temperature is and in summer can reach in the shade. Most rain falls in the summer monsoon, with occasional showers in the winter. In the escarpments and valleys, the climate is temperate with only summer monsoon rains, except close to the coast, where there is some winter rain; May is the hottest month. Towards the high plateau, the elevation rises steeply to , with some peaks high and the ground declines to the west. It is cooler, with the monsoon from June to September and light rain in April and May. The temperature is highest during the dry season from November to April and above , sub-alpine temperatures are found. The high ground continues into Northern Ethiopia, where the mountains and ravines make ideal defensive terrain. =Middle East Command= The British responded by building up a force of more than two divisions in Sudan and three in Kenya by early February 1941. The Sudan-based forces‚Äîcommanded by Lieutenant-General William Platt and under the command of General Archibald Wavell (Commander-in-Chief British Middle East Command)‚Äîhad invaded Eritrea through Kassala on 18 January and by 1 February had captured Agordat about further east. =Italian Invasion of Sudan= Anglo-Egyptian Sudan shared a border with the AOI, and on 4 July 1940, was invaded by an Italian force of about from Eritrea, which advanced on a railway junction at Kassala and forced the British garrison of of the SDF and some local police to retire, after inflicting casualties of and for ten casualties. The Italians also drove a platoon of No 3 Company, Eastern Arab Corps (EAC) of the SDF, from the small fort at Gallabat, just over the border from Metemma, about south of Kassala and took the villages of QaysƒÅn, Kurmuk and Dumbode on the Blue Nile. From there the Italians ventured no further into Sudan, owing to lack of fuel. They proceeded to fortify Kassala with anti-tank defences, machine-gun posts and strong-points, later establishing a brigade-strong garrison. The Italians were disappointed to find no strong anti-British sentiment among the native population. Prelude =Keren= The advance of Platt's forces into Eritrea Keren was not fortified but it is surrounded on most sides by a jumble of steep granite mountains and sharp ridges which gave the defending forces on the high ground a distinct advantage. Control of the mountains provided the Italian artillery with perfect observation of an attack. The narrow Dongolaas Gorge at through which the road and railway from Agordat to Keren passed was dominated on the south eastern side by the massif of Mount Zeban and Mount Falestoh on which stood the imposing defences of Fort Dologorodoc at . The other side of the gorge was commanded by the mass of Mount Sanchil with a saddle of secondary summits, Brig's Peak, Hog's Back and Flat Top stretching north-westwards toward Mount Sammana. In front of the Sanchil feature on its south western side was a secondary ridge, feature 1616, which became known as Cameron Ridge, overlooking the Ascidera Valley and the railway line. =Northern front= The 5th Indian Infantry Division began to arrive in Sudan in early September 1940 and the 29th Indian Infantry Brigade was placed on the Red Sea coast to protect Port Sudan, the 9th Indian Infantry Brigade south-west of Kassala and the 10th Indian Infantry Brigade (William Slim) were sent to Gedaref with the divisional headquarters, to block an Italian attack on Khartoum from Goz Regeb to Gallabat, on a front of . Gazelle Force (Colonel Frank Messervy) was formed on 16 October, as a mobile unit to raid Italian territory and delay an Italian advance. Late on 30 January, Gazelle Force was ordered to make pursuit of the enemy retreating down the road to Keren. As the British forces approached Keren, Brigadier-General Nicolangelo Carnimeo, commander of the 2nd Eritrean Division and the X Territorial Defence Command, drew in his 5th and 44th Colonial Brigades from positions to the north. 42nd Brigade had reached Keren from Agordat almost intact, and the 2nd Brigade‚Äîwhich had suffered greater casualties there‚Äîwas reforming. The 11th Regiment of the Savoia Grenadiers and the Alpini battalion of the 10th Savoia Grenadiers had just arrived after a three-day non-stop truck journey from Addis Ababa while the 11th Colonial Brigade was also in place, having previously been called from reserve in Addis Ababa. Meanwhile, the 6th Brigade‚Äîhaving relinquished its responsibilities at Metemma‚Äîwas also making its way to Keren. Battle =5‚Äì8 February= Sketch map of the Keren battlefield (not to scale) Keren battlefield today Indian troops at a signal point in a fort overlooking Sanchil. At 08:00 on 1 February 1941, Gazelle Force was held up in crossing the Baraka River about from Keren, where the Ponte Mussolini had been blown and the approaches to the river mined. By noon on 2 February, they were across the river and winding up the Ascidera Valley, until brought to a halt at the Dongolaas Gorge, about from Keren, where the road had been blocked by the Italians, who blew down the overhanging crags, to fill the gorge with boulders and rocks. The 11th Indian Infantry Brigade, (4th Indian Division) arrived on 3 February, reconnoitred the next day and attacked on the left of the gorge on 5 February. The 2nd Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders fought their way to the top of the ridge called feature 1616, in front of Sanchil and on the night of 6/7 February, the 3/14th Punjab Regiment passed through and advanced onto Brig's Peak. The Indians were counter- attacked by elements of the 65th Infantry Division \\"Granatieri di Savoia\\" (Grenadiers of Savoy) who forced them back towards Cameron Ridge, which was being consolidated by (Wellesley's) the 1st Battalion/6th Rajputana Rifles. The ridge was overlooked in front by Sanchil, to the left by Mount Sammana and from behind by other mountains along the Ascidera Valley. The Cameron Highlanders and Rajputana Rifles clung on, despite frequent attacks and having to carry food, water and ammunition up hill for , across exposed terrain. By 6 February, the 5th Indian Infantry Brigade (4th Indian Division) had arrived and next day, attacked the Dologorodoc feature east of the gorge, looping right through the Scescilembi Valley (known as Happy Valley) and then attacking from the south-east toward Acqua Col joining Mount Zelele and Mount Falestoh. On the night of 7 February, a company of (Outram's) the 4th Battalion/6th Rajputana Rifles took the col until 4:30 am, when they ran out of ammunition and were driven back to a lower feature. On 8 February, having spent most of the day under heavy artillery and mortar fire, they withdrew to their jumping-off positions. =10‚Äì13 February= On the afternoon of 10 February, 3/1st Punjab Regiment attacked Brig's Peak and by the morning of 11 February were on top of Sanchil. The need for men to handle and carry supplies, ammunition and wounded meant there were only two platoons to hold the feature. Having endured heavy shelling and mortar fire throughout the day, they were forced off Sanchil and Brig's Peak with heavy casualties by a determined counter-attack from the Savoia Grenadiers. Once again the attackers were thrown onto desperate defence on Cameron Ridge. Despite the failure by the Punjabis to hold the important observation posts on Sanchil, the renewed attack on Acqua Col‚Äîplanned for 12 February‚Äîwent ahead. The 29th Indian Infantry Brigade of the 5th Indian Infantry Division was brought up from Barentu and put under command of Major-General Beresford-Peirse (4th Indian Infantry Division) and held in readiness to exploit a break-through. At 05:30, supported by an intensive artillery barrage, the 4/6th Rajputana Rifles once again led the way. Richhpal Ram was less fortunate and having gained the crest, had a foot blown off and shortly thereafter was mortally wounded. He was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross for his exploits on the Col. The 4/11th Sikh Regiment were pushing up around the side of Acqua Col but the attack could not be carried through, lacking the extra impact that might have come from the 2/5th Mahratta Light Infantry which had been diverted to reinforce the hard-pressed defences on Cameron Ridge. Platt decided to pause, regroup and train before making a further attempt at Keren. To release road transport to bring forward supplies for a new attack, the 5th Indian Infantry Division returned to Kessala where it could be maintained by the railhead for a period of intensive training until preparations were complete and the division could be brought forward again for the offensive. Skinners Horse and most of the Motor Machine Gun companies assembled in front of Arressa and Adi Ugri to pose a threat to the Italian line of reinforcement to Keren. From the north, Briggsforce, comprising two battalions from the 7th Indian Infantry Brigade (Brigadier Harold Briggs) of the 4th Indian Infantry Division and two Free French battalions. After crossing the border into Eritrea on the Red Sea coast, Briggsforce had captured Karora and then moved south to take Kubkub. In late February, Marching Battalion n¬∫ 3 of the Free French Orient Brigade captured Kubkub, becoming the first French unit to engage in combat against Axis forces since the Fall of France. On 1 March, Briggsforce had broken through the Mescelit pass some north-east of Keren. Briggsforce provided a third potential direction of attack to occupy the Keren defenders and created a threat to Massawa on the coast, pinning valuable reserves there. Plan of attack Vickers Wellesley of No. 47 Squadron RAF based at Agordat, Eritrea, in flight during a bombing sortie to Keren The scene was set for a set-piece battle with Major-General Noel Beresford-Peirse's 4th Indian Infantry Division concentrated on the Sanchil side of the gorge and Lewis Heath's 5th Indian Infantry Division, brought forward from Kessala once again, on the Happy Valley side. The Keren defences had been reinforced with the arrival of 6th Colonial Brigade from Metemma and also the 11th Blackshirt Battalion of the Savoia Grenadiers. The defenders now totalled 25,000 facing an attacking force which had grown to more than 13,000. Beresford-Pierce would launch the 11th Indian Brigade, expanded to five battalions under command, against the peaks of the Sanchil mass and 5th Brigade against Mount Sammana on the left of his front. On the 5th Division front, the Italian reinforcements on Dologorodoc meant Happy Valley was dominated by the defenders and the attackers' artillery had had to be withdrawn from their forward positions in the valley to safer locations. Without the artillery, it was no longer considered practical to continue the flanking attack through Acqua Col to threaten the Dologorodoc lines of supply. Instead, Major-General Lewis Heath determined that Fort Dologorodoc would be the key objective for his Indian 5th Infantry Division. Gaining the fort would not only give the attacking forces the artillery observation post to direct fire on both sides of the gorge but would expose the reverse slopes of the Dologorodoc mass (which had been immune to his artillery fire and so a haven to the defenders for supplies and reserves) to direct fire from the fort. The two offensives were planned to take place one after the other on 15 March so that the full force's artillery could be employed for the preliminary bombardment of them both. At the final meeting on 14 March with his commanders Platt said, =15‚Äì27 March= At 07:00 on 15 March, the British and Commonwealth troops of 4th Indian Infantry Division attacked from Cameron Ridge making for Sanchil, Brig's Peak, Hog's Back and the three peaks of Mount Sammana. That night, the battle ebbed and flowed with attack and counter-attack inflicting very heavy casualties on both sides. On the right, 5th Indian Infantry Division launched its attack on the Dologorodoc feature at 10:30 on 15 March. The 2nd Highland Light Infantry led the attack on the lower features (\\"Pimple\\" and \\"Pinnacle\\") but made no progress in the daylight because of fire from the overlooking Sanchil peak, where the Italian defenders had defeated the 11th Brigade assault. They were pinned down, suffering casualties and without supply until darkness provided the opportunity to withdraw. By moonlight that evening, the attack on Dologorodoc was taken up by 9th Brigade, now commanded by the recently promoted Brigadier Messervy. Heath and Messervy planned a near two battalion attack on Pimple and Pinnacle, with a third battalion ready to pass through and attack the fort. The capture of Pinnacle that night by the 3/5th Mahratta Light Infantry led by Lieutenant-Colonel Denys Reid (with the 3/12th Frontier Force Regiment less two companies under command to take Pimple), In the early hours of 16 March, the defenders of Fort Dologorodoc counter-attacked Pinnacle and Pimple for several hours. The defences at the fort were depleted and during the counter- attack, the 2nd West Yorkshire Regiment made their way over a seemingly impossible knife-edge to surprise the defenders of the fort. The fort was captured after a determined defence by 06:30 with 40 prisoners taken. Finally, Platt had the artillery observation point so greatly needed. Through 16 March, the Italians counter-attacked while the 29th Brigade made an unsuccessful attack in the evening to Falestoh and Zeban, which was abandoned after dark on 17 March after a day exposed to blistering heat, fierce fighting and no supply. For the next ten days, the 5th Indian Division position at Fort Dologorodoc‚Äîexposed to the enemy on three sides‚Äîwas subject to intense fighting, as the Italians threw in more new units but failed to regain the position. On the Sanchil feature, the 4th Indian Division, with the 10th Indian Infantry Brigade under command, continued to batter away to no avail. On the night of 17/18 March, having suffered many casualties, they withdrew from the slopes of Sanchil and Brig's Peak and the 10th Brigade returned to the 5th Indian Division to reform. The 4th Indian Division continued to hold Hog's Back and Flat Top. Over the next three days, the Italian forces continued to counter-attacks on both sides of the gorge involving desperate, often hand to hand, fighting. Indian soldiers in action before the capture of Keren in Eritrea, 1941. Platt decided to regroup and concentrate his forces before attacking again and disbanded Gazelle Force (with Messervy taking over the 9th Indian Brigade) and brought the 5th Indian Infantry Division (which had been mopping up at Agordat) to the front. On 1 March his command was expanded by the arrival of Briggs Force from the north. Although it lacked the artillery for a big attack, Briggs Force drew off a significant part of the Keren garrison. This aided Platt's main offensive, which was being launched from the south-west. Briggs Force also menaced Massawa to the east, obliging the Italians to maintain a reserve on the coast. Platt and his commanders decided that the supreme attack should be made through the Dongolaas Gorge. Heath felt that, because of its physical defensive advantages, the Italians might have neglected its defence. On the nights of 16/17 and 17/18 March, escorted engineers reconnoitred the road block and attempted to make a start to clear it. This failed because of fire from the Italian lines. The information led Heath to decide that the key to the gorge was not Sanchil but two smaller features (the Railway Bumps) which overlooked the roadblock and could be approached, with much less opposition, along the railway line from the tunnel below Cameron Ridge. An attack on the defenders at the head of the gorge was planned to give the sappers and miners the 48 hours they needed, free of interference from mortar and machine gun fire, to clear the road. Heath had to wait until the 10th Indian Brigade had refitted after its mauling on the Sanchil feature. The plan was for the 10th Indian Brigade to advance into the gorge while the 9th Indian Brigade (which was holding the Fort Dologorodoc positions) would move down to take three smaller hills overlooking the far end of the gorge; The 29th Brigade would then attack to take Mount Zeban and Mount Canabai, beyond it to the east, which looked down on Keren and guarded the road to Asmara. Thomas \\"Pete\\" Rees was appointed to command the 10th Indian Brigade and his predecessor, Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Fletcher was released to form Fletcher Force, a mobile force comprising the Central India Horse and six Matilda II tanks, which would be used to exploit the break-through in the gorge and move rapidly into the defenders' rear position to attack their reserves. On 24 March, diversionary attacks were made on Sanchil and just before midnight, the West Yorkshires and the 3/5th Mahrattas in Fort Dologorodoc moved down to take the lower hills overlooking the gorge. The West Yorkshires were able to take their hill unopposed but the Mahrattas met dug-in Italian opposition. By 07:30 the three hills were taken and the defences on the south eastern side of the gorge silenced. At 03:00 on 25 March, the 2nd Highland Light Infantry and the 4/10th Baluch Regiment on their right, advanced from the shelter of the railway tunnel, previously cleared by the sappers and miners, up the gorge. A hundred-gun artillery bombardment was raining down on the ridge on Sanchil above (to suppress any defensive fire from this dominating height) and the attack in the gorge achieved surprise, the defenders concentrating on Sanchil. The 3/2nd Punjab Regiment then advanced between the Baluchis and the West Yorkshires to clear the gorge. By 05:30, the railway bumps and most of the objectives were captured and the defenders no longer held positions from which to direct fire into the gorge below. The sappers and miners laboured on the road while the battles on the Sanchil and Dologorodoc features continued. By midday on 26 March, they had repaired the road through the gorge. In the early hours of 27 March, the British artillery turned onto Zeban and Falstoh. The 29th Brigade passed through the 9th Indian Brigade to attack at 04:30 but found the defenders had withdrawn and were able to occupy Falestoh Ridge and the two Zeban summits unopposed. The Italian position was untenable and by first light the Royal Air Force (RAF) was reporting their withdrawal along the road from Keren to Asmara. The defenders on the Sanchil ridge were less fortunate and the Savoia Grenadiers and Bersaglieri were cut off and with no option but surrender. Fletcher Force was in Keren by 10:30 and was then sent in pursuit along the Asmara road.

From 27 March 1941, the route to Asmara and Massawa was open and Wavell was able to order the 4th Indian Division move to Port Sudan for transport back to Egypt. On 11 April, the US President, Franklin D. Roosevelt, rescinded the status of the Red Sea as a combat zone under the Neutrality Acts, freeing US merchant ships to use the route to carry supplies to the Middle East. =Casualties= In the 4th Division history of 1948, Stevens gave of whom about ten percent were killed.

During the evening of 31 March, three of the last six destroyers at Massawa put to sea, to raid the Gulf of Suez and then scuttle themselves but Leone ran aground and sank the next morning and the sortie was cancelled. On 2 April the last five destroyers left to attack Port Sudan and then sink themselves. Heath telephoned Bonetti with an ultimatum to surrender and not block the harbour by scuttling ships. If this was refused, the British would leave Italian citizens in Eritrea and Ethiopia to fend for themselves. The 7th Indian Infantry Brigade Group sent small forces towards Adowa and Adigrat and the rest advanced down the Massawa road, which declined by in and the Indians rendezvoused with Briggs Force, which had cut across country, at Massawa by 5 April. Bonetti was called upon to surrender but refused again and on 8 April, an attack by the 7th Indian Infantry Brigade Group was repulsed. A simultaneous attack by the 10th Indian Infantry Brigade and the tanks of B Squadron 4th RTR broke through the defences on the west side. The Free French overran the defences in the south- west, taking Montecullo and Fort Umberto April 7 as the RAF bombed Italian artillery positions. Colonel Monclar of the 13th French Foreign Legion Demi- Brigade captured the Italian Admiralty building and accepted Bonetti's surrender, taking and The harbour was found to have been blocked by the scuttling of two large floating dry docks, ships and a floating crane in the mouths of the north Naval Harbour, the central Commercial Harbour and the main South Harbour. The Italians had also dumped as much of their equipment as possible in the water. The British re-opened the Massawa‚ÄìAsmara railway on 27 April and by 1 May, the port came into use to supply the 5th Indian Division. The Italian surrender ended organised resistance in Eritrea and fulfilled the strategic objective of ending the threat to shipping in the Red Sea.

The station is served by Amtrak's (the National Railroad Passenger Corporation) Amtrak Cascades and Coast Starlight. Local transit connections are provided by Intercity Transit. Bus routes 64 and 94 connect to Lacey and Olympia Transit centers. History The original Union Pacific East Olympia station in East Olympia was demolished in the late 1960s. It was used by the pool trains that ran between Seattle and Portland by all three railroads that used the line, Northern Pacific, Great Northern, and Union Pacific. Northern Pacific also had a station at Kyro, approximately northeast of the current station. Amtrak trains during the 1970s and 1980s used a wooden shelter as East Olympia's passenger train station. However, the station site was remote and had no public transport, no lighting and a pot- holed gravel parking lot with a public telephone that rarely worked. The stop was listed in the October 28, 1990 Coast Starlight timetable. The new Centennial Station was built by the non-profit Amtrak Depot Committee, which began raising funds in 1987 and aimed to open a permanent station in time for the state centennial in 1989. The committee raised $500,000 through government grants, business contributions, individual donations, and the sale of engraved bricks that were later laid in the station plaza. Centennial Station opened to the public on May 1, 1993, following the delayed installation of a sewer system, and was added to the Amtrak system. It is believed to be the only Amtrak station in the nation and operated entirely by volunteers. The train station was sold to Intercity Transit for $1 in September 1993, while the Amtrak Depot Committee remained the main operators of the facility. The committee also raised $10,000 to install a clocktower in the courtyard, which was dedicated on November 14, 1994, as part of a ceremony for the Talgo trainsets entering service on the Seattle‚ÄìPortland corridor. The station's parking lot was expanded to 133 stalls as part of an improvement project that was completed in 2001. A second improvement project, completed in 2003, included a rebuilt train platform for accessibility and the installation of an electronic information kiosk.

Fort Robidoux was founded in 1832 after Antoine Robidoux bought the Reed Trading Post that had been in operation there since 1828. Robidoux had traded for beaver pelts in the Uintah Basin as early as 1824. By 1828 he had established his first trading post in the intermountain corridor of the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains on the Gunnison River near present-day Delta, Colorado. That same year, Robidoux took out Mexican citizenship and married Carmel Benevedes, the daughter of the governor of New Mexico. This enabled him to obtain a Mexican trading and trapping license. With Robidoux's focus on the Colorado fort, William Reed, his twelve-year-old nephew James Reed, and Denis Julien traveled to the Uinta Basin and established the Reed Trading Post, making this the first permanent non-Indian residence and business in the State of Utah. Once his operations were well established on the Gunnison River, Robidoux purchased both the site and business from Reed and expanded their operation by building a larger fort and bringing in trappers to trap the beaver-rich streams of the Green and Uintah rivers. Robidoux successfully competed in the Uinta Basin region's fur trade against competition from Fort Davy Crockett, the American Fur Company, the Hudson's Bay Company, and traders out of Bent's Fort. Robidoux's business practices at Fort Robidoux included trapping and trading for furs from the Indians and from free trappers, horse trading, and the illegal practice of trading both guns and liquor to the Indians. There is some evidence that Robidoux was also involved in Indian slave trade.John D. Barton, Antoine Robidoux?Buckskin Entrepreneur (1993); David Weber, The Taos Trappers (1968); and LeRoy R. Hafen, The Old Spanish Trail (1954) During his years in business such notables as Kit Carson, Miles Goodyear, Marcus Whitman, Joe Meeks, Captain John C. Fremont, August Archambeaux, Rufus Sage, and the Reverend Joseph Williams all visited Fort Uintah. As the beaver trade declined in the late 1830s and early 1840s, so too did Robidoux's business. In August 1844 Ute warriors attacked and burned both Fort Robidoux and the Gunnison fort. Causes for the attack could have included Robidoux's cheating of the Indians, involvement with the capture of Indian women and children for prostitution and slavery, and sales of guns and alcohol to the Utes. The attack and burning of Robidoux's forts were the only successful attack by Indians of a trading post in fur trade history.

The pact divided Andalusia into separate zones of conquest for the two kingdoms, so that the work of the Reconquista would not be stymied by internecine feuding over spoils among the Christians. Aragon was given the places of X√†tiva, Denia, and Biar, from Biar to Calpe towards Valencia. Castile had all the lands on the other side of Biar. Compared with the earlier Treaty of Tudil√©n, Aragon had lost the right of annexing Murcia. The agreement further stipulated that it was to be held in perpetuity and upheld by the successors of both Alfonsos. This was reinforced with a clause stating that neither king could give up his part or diminish the part of the other, nor could any obstacle be put in the way by either king of the conquest by his counterpart of his rightful division. The subsequent breach of the treaty by both parties led to the Treaty of Almizra in 1244. References *Barton, Simon. 1997. The Aristocracy in Twelfth-Century Le√≥n and Castile.

Biography =Early life= Jeanne was born in Saumur, located in the region of Anjo√∫, France, the youngest of twelve children. Throughout much of her childhood and early life she was described as very selfish, thinking only of herself. Her father was a draper, and her mother ran a shop selling religious goods, catering to pilgrims to a local shrine to the Blessed Virgin Mary, under the title of Our Lady of Ardillier. She took this business over at the age of 25 when her mother died. She also provided accommodations to pilgrims who were visiting the shrine. The fact, however, that her only goal was to make money from them was apparent when she opened her store on Sundays, an unusual practice in that period. =Conversion= On Pentecost 1693, Jeanne encountered a poor widow and pilgrim from Rennes, named Francoise Fouchet, who predicted that Jeanne would one day spend her life in care for the poor. Though Jeanne was already a devout person, this prediction was met with skepticism; but as time passed, caring for the less fortunate is exactly what Jeanne came to do. She began caring for orphans and living a truly spiritual life, to the point where she eventually closed the family business to commit herself more fully to this work. As she converted her ways, many doubted her sincerity but she was not discouraged. Jeanne, along with other women who shared her vision of helping the needy, founded the Sisters of Saint Anne of Providence of Samur. The congregation was formally approved by the Vatican in 1704. Worn out by her labors, Jeanne Delanoue died on 17 August 1736 at Fencet, France, of natural causes. At the time of her death there were twelve communities of her sisters, spread throughout France, serving the poor and needy. Legacy The congregation Jeanne founded was renamed Congregation of the Sisters of St. Anne of Providence of Saumur on 3 December 1964. She was canonized in October 1982 by Pope John Paul II. Today the congregation she founded serves the poor in France, Madagascar and Sumatra. La Nef ardente is an oratorio by Michel Bosc about Jeanne Delanoue.

The masque is notable for the contradictory historical evidence connected with it and the confusion it caused among generations of scholars and critics.  Context  The masque was intended as the major entertainment of the 1623-24 Christmas holiday season, and was scheduled to be performed on Twelfth Night, 6 January 1624. During the Jacobean era, however, attendance at the performances of the Stuart Court masques was coveted and controversial -- especially among the foreign diplomats of the Court, who competed fiercely among themselves for admittance to the masques and especially for seating near the King.Chambers, Vol. 3, pp. 375-91. In the case of Neptune's Triumph, the dispute between the French and Spanish ambassadors was so intense that James I cancelled the performance. There was more than ego or vague national pride involved: James's son and heir, the future Charles I, had returned from Spain and his fruitless quest for a marriage with the Spanish Infanta, the \\"Spanish match\\" that was a point of intense controversy in Britain at the time. His arrival back in England on 5 October 1623 is the \\"return of Albion\\" of the title. James himself had censored and approved the text of the masque; but since he had been the prime backer of the Spanish match, a masque that took a benign view of its failure was perhaps easy for the King to cancel.  Contents  The masque opens with a long conversation between a poet and a cook, who represent Jonson and Jones respectively. The cook and his cookery are Jonson's satire on Jones's artistry in masque design. After the anti-masque, Jones's set of the floating island of Delos was meant to be revealed, with Apollo and Mercury presenting the serious portion of the work, supported by the minor Greek sea gods Proteus, Portunus, and Saron.Portunus and Saron were the gods of ports and navigation respectively. Songs and dances would have ensued, and an anti-masque of sailors. It is possible that Jonson's unperformed masque may have influenced the most famous literary work connected with the Spanish match affair, Middleton's A Game at Chess.Howard-Hill, p. 42. When Jonson's text was published, in quarto in 1624 and in the second folio collection of Jonson's works in 1641, the wording of the title pages gave the impression that the masque had in fact been performed. Generations of scholars took these statements at face value, and believed that the masque had been staged. The fact that none of his contemporaries had actually seen the masque allowed Jonson to re-use material from the text in subsequent works. Some \\"lyrical passages\\" from Neptune's Triumph re-appeared in the next year's masque The Fortunate Isles and Their Union, while comedy material from the anti-masque that satirizes Inigo Jones is employed in The Staple of News (1626).Leapman, pp. 216-17.

It is about the effects of the Nigerian Civil War (1967‚Äì1970) on the people and the \\"civil peace\\" that followed. Plot summary The story starts off in eastern Nigeria after the civil war has ended. The protagonist, Jonathan Iwegbu, was able to keep his bicycle, which he turns into a taxi to make money. In two weeks he makes 150 pounds. Jonathan then travels to Enugu to search for his home, and to his surprise it is still standing when other structures around it are demolished. The house needs some repairs, so Jonathan finds some supplies around and makes it look like a home again. He then moves his family back in. The entire family works hard to earn money and rebuild their lives. The children pick mangoes and sell them to soldier‚Äôs wives, while Maria makes akara balls to sell to their neighbors. After finding that his job as a miner isn't a possibility, he decides to run a bar for soldiers out of his house. Jonathan gets an \\"egg rasher\\" (a butchered pronunciation of the Latin ex gratia, which translates into \\"as a favor\\") for turning in rebel currency to the Treasury, and in exchange they gave him 20 pounds legitimate currency. The next night, a large group of robbers show up at his house demanding 100 pounds. When Jonathan replies that he only has 20 pounds, the leader of the robbers demands he hand the money through the open window. After they take the money, life goes on as usual for Jonathan because \\"Nothing Puzzles God,\\" meaning that the robbery has a greater meaning in God's eyes than how it seemed to Jonathan. Character overview ;Jonathan Iwegbu Jonathan Iwegbu, the protagonist of \\"Civil Peace\\", is the optimistic nucleus of the entire narrative. Despite the recent devastation of the Biafran War, Jonathan exhibits a happy tone in the face of death. Jonathan's optimism is first demonstrated in the first paragraph when he exclaims how happy he is for his life. The quote repeated towards the end of the book reflects the theme is \\"Nothing puzzles God\\" and then continues to explain \\"He had come out of the war with five inestimable blessings --- his head, his wife Maria‚Äôs head, and the heads of three out of their four children.\\" The protagonist is happy because he can now enjoy the company of those alive, instead of being sad for the one who died. Jonathan's optimism continues to prevail when he sees his house for the first time which, was slightly damaged \\"But what was that?\\" and then continues to explain that he had enough time left in the day to forage for materials \\"... before thousands more came out of their forest holes looking for the same things,\\" further emphasizing his optimism and its benefits. Later in the story, Jonathan opens a bar, creating new employment as opposed to dwelling in the fact that his former job, mining coal, is no longer an option. Jonathan's optimism remains unshakable through to the end of the story even when all of his money is stolen by thieves. Historical context Much of Chinua Achebe's literature was inspired by the events of the Biafran War and by the responses to a war that, for many Igbo writers, was a struggle for survival, a search for a new beginning for Africa, and a redefinition of Black identity in the context of a complex world behavior. A leading novelist at the time, Chinua Achebe was a pioneer in post-war Igbo literary activities. Achebe maintained Achebe does not hide the fact that the Biafran situation has affected his creativity in no small way.

The treaty was an armistice ending a war between the Greek states and Benevento, during which the Byzantine Empire had not intervened on behalf of its subjects. It was supposed to last five years between the Lombard prince and the Neapolitans. It was a temporary armistice and was distinguished from other treaties such as Pactum Warmundi, which established temporary alliances. The political situation in the Campania region during the ninth- and tenth-century was described as unstable and typified by constant tensions between and within the neighbouring polities. The Pactum Sicardi assumed the form of a multi-clause treaty that probably aimed to address all possible causes of conflict between the two signatories. By the treaty Prince Sicard recognised the rights of merchants from the three cities to travel through his domains. He made navigation up the rivers Patria, Volturno, and Minturno open to merchants, responsales (envoys), and milities (soldiers). Sicard did not give up his powers of enforcement over either the illegal slave trade (in Lombards) or the trafficking in stolen merchandise. He did abolish the lex naufragii (law of shipwreck) by which the landowner on whose shores a wrecked ship or its cargo washed up was the possessor of that wealth: \\"If a ship is wrecked because of the fault [of the men aboard] the goods found in it are to be returned to the one to whome they belonged and still belong.\\" This measure, protecting the property rights of shipping companies and merchants, was \\"far in advance of these times\\".Lopez and Raymond, 33-35, who provide an English translation of a long excerpt from the Vulgar Latin original. Despite these efforts, a war began again in 837, when Duke Andrew of Naples called in Saracens as allies against Benevento. In 838 Sicard captured Amalfi by sea. The Pactum Sicardi has indicated the interest of the parties on this territory, particularly with the fragmentary reference of the treaty, which detailed an interest on both sides to control the activities of the Amalfitans.

The airport is located northwest of Dubbo and is operated by the Dubbo City Council. It is also known as Dubbo Airport or Dubbo City Airport.  History  Airplanes began landing in Dubbo in the 1920s, though it wasn't until 1935 that land was purchased for an official airport. During World War II, the airport was reconstructed to be a military airport. The airport runway was redone by the Department of Civil Aviation in 1969, and a terminal was opened in 1970. The Dubbo City Council accepted ownership of the airport on 1 July 1970. The airport has been used for scheduled, charter, and freight services since then.  Facilities  The airport resides at an elevation of above sea level. It has two asphalt paved runways: 05/23 measuring and 11/29 measuring .  Airlines and destinations   Incidents  * At Dubbo Airport there is a concern of animal and bird strikes. There has been an accident near the airport in July 2009 where a small aerobatic plane crash landed in a paddock near the airport. * In April 2010, it was found that the PIN to access the secure areas of the airport such as the tarmac was taped to the gate above the keypad. This was deemed \\"not acceptable\\" by Federal Transport Minister Anthony Albanese. Despite this security breach, the airport managed to pass a security audit in 2009. Controversy In February 2013, Dubbo City Council (DCC) announced that it would screen all passengers and bags boarding Regional Express and QantasLink aircraft, after QantasLink announced it would introduce the Dash-8 Q400 to the route. DCC would also charge Regional Express (REX) more than per year for the screening, which REX sees as subsidising QantasLink, after DCC claimed to the Deputy Premier, Andrew Stoner, that it is required under the Air Transport Safety Regulations (ATSR) and that it is inflexible. REX hit back at the claims that screening was necessary, pointing out that Albury and Wagga Wagga Airports allow parallel departures under the ATSR and at Mildura, passengers are screened at no extra cost. REX lodged an official complaint against DCC with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission over the screening charge. The Mayor of Dubbo, Mathew Dickerson, stated that the council wouldn't back down on the screenings and also stating that \\"I don't want to be the mayor when a Dubbo plane hits the Harbour Bridge because passengers were not screened\\". REX announced that would refuse to pay any security screening costs and is planning to re-deploy aircraft used on the Dubbo‚ÄìSydney route. On 14 March 2013, REX announced that it could cut the weekly services, in response to DCC decision to charge for screening, on the Dubbo‚ÄìSydney route from 82 to 73 flights from April 2013 and re-deploying its Dubbo‚ÄìSydney aircraft for the Wagga Wagga to Sydney route.

It relies on private contributions to help maintain San Francisco‚Äôs fleet of historic streetcars in service on the E Embarcadero and F Market & Wharves lines and the national landmark cable cars. Market Street Railway operates a vintage vehicle restoration facility at 1 Buchanan Street, in the shadow of the 1937 San Francisco Mint. It is here that Market Street Railway volunteers restore historic vehicles before donating them to Muni. Market Street Railway borrows the name of the Market Street Railway Company, a former commercial streetcar and bus operator in San Francisco. History Founded in 1976, Market Street Railway members created the successful San Francisco Historic Trolley Festival of the 1980s that resulted in the permanent return of streetcars to Market Street in the form of the F Market & Wharves ‚Äî the most popular service of its kind in all of North America. Service on F-Market commenced on September 1, 1995, replacing Muni's 8-Market trolley bus line. Currently, the F line carries nearly four times the ridership of the bus lines it replaced. In 1996, one year after service began, F-Market streetcars carried an average of 7,758 passengers per day, a 43% increase in ridership over the 8-Market trolley bus. By 2008, F-Market streetcars were carrying an average of 20,000 riders per day, and were so overcrowded that drivers were forced to skip stops. For comparison, the Muni Metro system carried an average of 130,000 passengers per day through the Market Street subway in 1999. Service expanded in 2015 with the E Embarcadero line. The E line directly connects several regional transit services, including Caltrain, BART and bay ferries to waterfront businesses and attractions stretching from Mission Bay to Fort Mason. Since its inception, Market Street Railway has helped Muni to acquire and restore more than a dozen historic streetcars and cable cars for service, adding diversity to Muni‚Äôs large historic fleet. Market Street Railway's restoration corps has done much of this restoration work themselves. Its volunteers also clean the cars' interiors at the Castro Street Terminal to improve rider experience. San Francisco Railway Museum Additionally, Market Street Railway developed and operates the San Francisco Railway Museum, a local history museum in the Vitale Hotel on the Embarcadero that showcases historical railway artifacts and tells the story of transportation in San Francisco. Vision for the future Led by President Rick Laubscher, Market Street Railway is working to increase F-line service levels. Extension of historic trolley service through Fort Mason Tunnel is currently being evaluated by Muni. Market Street Railway is also working to restore and inaugurate the Market Street Railway Teaching Trolley, a 1924 streetcar that will serve to teach schoolchildren how electric railway vehicles work.

Some people make similar claims regarding his mother, the Blessed Virgin Mary. Discussions about the authenticity of these visions have often invited controversy. The Catholic Church endorses a fraction of these claims, and various visionaries it accepts have achieved beatification, or even sainthood. The first reported visions of Christ, and personal conversations with him, after his resurrection and prior to his ascension are found in the New Testament. One of the most widely recalled Resurrection appearances of Jesus is the doubting Thomas conversation (John 20:24-29) between Jesus and Thomas the Apostle after his death. The last book of the Bible itself is based on a series of visions. Acceptance and impact Saint Teresa of √Åvila, by Peter Paul Rubens, 1615. Some visions predate the Protestant Reformation, yet among Christian denominations, the Catholic Church has made more formal comments on visions of Jesus and the Virgin Mary. Author Michael Freze argues that Catholic practices such as Eucharistic adoration, rosary devotions and contemplative meditation with a focus on interior life facilitate visions and apparitions. In recent centuries, people reporting visions of Jesus and Mary have been of diverse backgrounds: laity and clergy, young and old, Catholics and Protestants, the devout and the previously non-believing.Wiebe, Phillip H. Visions of Jesus, 1998, Oxford University Press page vii Visions should also be differentiated from interior locutions such as those purportedly experienced by Consolata Betrone, in which inner voices are reported, but no visual or physical contact is claimed. =Vatican guidelines= The Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith at the Vatican has published a detailed set of steps for \\"Judging Alleged Apparitions and Revelations\\" that claim supernatural origin.\\"Expert explains Church‚Äôs criteria for confirming Marian apparitions\\", Catholic News Agency, May 8, 2008 As a historical pattern, Vatican approval seems to have followed general acceptance of a vision by well over a century in most cases. The reported visions of Jesus and Mary by Beno√Æte Rencurel in Saint-√âtienne- le-Laus in France from 1664 to 1718 were only recognized by the Holy See in May 2008, making them the first Marian apparitions and visions of Jesus to be approved in the 21st century. According to Father Salvatore M. Perrella of the Mariunum Pontifical Institute in Rome, this is the 12th Marian apparition approved by the Holy See from a total of 295 that have been studied through the centuries.\\"Vatican recognizes Marian apparitions in France\\", Catholic News Agency, May 5, 2008 L√∫cia Santos (left) with her cousins Francisco and Jacinta Marto, 1917, were the three shepherds of F√°tima. = Controversies = Many visions of Jesus following his ascension have been reported after the Book of Revelation was written. But the Book of Revelation itself specifically mentions the case of ‚Äúfalse prophets‚Äù (Rev 19:20) and undoubtedly not everyone claiming to converse with Jesus can be believed. Over the years, a number of people claiming to converse with Jesus for the sake of monetary gain have been exposed. A well-known example was Protestant televangelist Peter Popoff who often claimed to receive messages from God to heal people on stage. Popoff was exposed in 1987 when intercepted messages from his wife to a small radio receiver hidden in his ear were replayed on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.\\"TV Evangelist Denies Use Of Radio In Healing Service\\". Philadelphia Inquirer. July 15, 1986. \\"Evangelist Popoff Off Air, Files Bankruptcy Petitions\\". Los Angeles Times. September 26, 1987. Another example is messages from Jesus reported by Catalina Rivas, which have been exposed in a number of cases as less than truthful.\\"Catalina Rivas\\", Skeptics Dictionary A number of messages which Rivas reported as having been received from God were later found to correspond to exact pages of books previously written by other authors (e.g. Jos√© Prado Flores), and published instructional literature for Catholic seminarians.\\"Plagiarism of Carmelita Rivas\\" Some reported messages from the Virgin Mary have also involved controversy. Reported Marian messages from Veronica Lueken were declared invalid by Bishop Francis Mugavero of the Roman Catholic Diocese of BrooklynMugavero, Francis. \\"Declaration Concerning The 'Bayside Movement'\\", November 4, 1986 and reports of Our Lady of Surbiton claiming that the Virgin Mary appeared every day under a pine tree in England were flatly rejected by the Vatican as a fraud.Petre, Jonathan. \\"Vatican rejects woman's Virgin Mary claim\\", The Telegraph, September 23, 2007 The Catholic Church has, at times, taken a harsh view of some people who have claimed religious visions. In December 1906, during the reign of Pope Pius X the former Polish nun Feliksa Kozlowska became the first woman in history to be excommunicated by name as a heretic. Some visions of Jesus have simply been classified as hallucinations by the Church, while in a few cases the Church has chosen to remain silent on the authenticity of claimed visions. =Influence= Mary of the Divine Heart Droste zu Vischering. Despite the expected controversies, post-Ascension visions of Jesus and the Virgin Mary have, in fact, played a key role in the direction of the Catholic Church, e.g. the formation of the Franciscan order and the devotions to the Holy Rosary, the Holy Face of Jesus and the Sacred Heart of Jesus. Key elements of modern Roman Catholic Mariology have been influenced by visions reported by children at Lourdes and F√°tima. Reported messages from Jesus have also influenced papal actions and encyclicals. For instance, the 1899 consecration of the world to the Sacred Heart of Jesus by Pope Leo XIII in the encyclical Annum sacrum was due to the messages from Jesus reported by a Sister of the Good Shepherd, Blessed Mary of the Divine Heart Droste zu Vischering. Pope Leo XIII performed the requested consecration a few days after the death of Sister Mary and called it \\"the greatest act of my pontificate\\".Bainvel, Jean. \\"Devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia.

Also Blessed Alexandrina of Balazar, in Portugal, reported many private apparitions, messages and prophecies received directly from Jesus and the Virgin Mary. In June 1938, based on the request of her spiritual director Father Mariano Pinho, several bishops from Portugal wrote to Pope Pius XI, asking him to consecrate the world to the Immaculate Heart of Mary. At that time Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli (later Pope Pius XII) was the secretary of the state of the Vatican, and he later performed the consecration of the world.Calkins, Arthur Burton. Totus tuus: John Paul II's program of Marian consecration and entrustment, 1992, page 97 =Pilgrimages= Churches and sanctuaries built based on reported visions of Jesus and Mary attract many millions of pilgrims each year. According to Bishop Francesco Giogia the majority of the most visited Catholic shrines in the world are vision based, in that with about 10 million pilgrims, the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe, in Mexico City, was the most visited Catholic shrine in the world in 1999,\\"Shrine Of Guadalupe Most Popular In World\\", Zenit News, June 13, 1999 now followed by the Sanctuary of Our Lady of F√°tima, in Cova da Iria, Portugal, with between 6 and 8 million pilgrims per year.\\"Religion moves 330 million tourists a year and six million go to F√°tima\\", Di√°rio de Not√≠cias, February 19, 2017.\\"F√°tima expects to receive 8 million visitors in 2017\\", in Sapo20, December 15, 2016.

On the other hand, some predictions based on visions continue to gather interest decades after they were made. Messages from Jesus reported by John Leary in Rochester, New York, in 1999 had predicted that Pope John Paul II would be forced out of Rome and sent into exile amid chaos. Bishop Matthew Clark of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rochester disallowed these messages at the time; with the election of Pope Benedict XVI the debate about the validity of these messages seems to have been rendered moot. On August 19, 1982, some teenagers in Kibeho, Rwanda reported visions of the Blessed Virgin Mary and Jesus Christ, as Our Lady of Kibeho. The teenagers reported truly gruesome sights such as rivers of blood and the visions were accompanied by intense reactions: crying, tremors, and comas. Some today regard the visions as an ominous prediction of the Rwandan genocide of 1994, and particularly in that specific location in 1995 in which some of the teenagers died a decade after their vision. The apparitions were approved by the local Roman Catholic bishop and later by the Holy See.\\"Declaration Of The Bishop Of Gikongoro, June 29, 2001  Visions of the early saints  Saint Francis of Assisi embracing Christ on the Cross, by Murillo, 1668. The Bible includes primarily pre-Ascension visions of Jesus, except for the vision of Christ by Saint Stephen just before his death (Acts 7:55), and the conversation between Jesus and Saint Ananias in Damascus in which Saint Ananias is ordered to heal Saint Paul (Acts 9:10-18).Bible gateway Acts 7:55 The Damascus appearance is the last reported vision of Jesus in the Bible until the Book of Revelation was written. However, in the following centuries, many saints reported visions of both Jesus and the Blessed Virgin Mary. In 1205, while praying in the Church of San Damiano just outside Assisi, Saint Francis of Assisi reported a vision in which an image of Jesus came alive and told him: \\"Francis, Francis, go and repair My house which, as you can see, is falling into ruins.\\" This vision lead Saint Francis to renounce the outlook of his merchant family, embrace poverty and form the Franciscan order. The Franciscans became a key force in the renewal of the reach of Christianity. During another vision in 1224 Saint Francis reportedly received the very first recorded case of stigmata. Starting in 1208, Saint Juliana of Liege had visions of Christ which she kept a secret for almost 20 years. In these visions she was reportedly told to institute a solemn feast for the Blessed Sacrament as the Body of Christ. When she eventually reported her visions to her confessor, the information was relayed to the bishop. Years later, in 1264, in the papal bull Transiturus de hoc mundo Pope Urban IV (who was formerly the Archdeacon of Liege) formally declared the feast of Corpus Christi as the first papally sanctioned universal feast for the Latin Rite.Jestice, Phyllis. Holy people of the world Published by ABC-CLIO, 2004 page 457 However, in the meantime, due to a conflict with a local church official, she was driven out of Liege and lived in seclusion at Fosses-la- Ville until she died. On her deathbed she asked for her confessor, supposedly to reveal to him some secrets regarding her visions. But neither he nor any of her friends from Liege arrived and other secrets regarding her visions remain unknown.Barbara R. Walters, 2007, The Feast of Corpus Christi, Penn State Press, 2007 page 11 The Blessed Virgin Mary is traditionally said to have appeared to the English Carmelite priest St. Simon Stock in 1251, and given him the Carmelite habit, the Brown Scapular. Saint Catherine of Siena, Doctor of the Church by Tiepolo, c. 1746 Saint Catherine of Siena was a withdrawn Dominican tertiary who lived, fasted and prayed at home in Siena Italy. In 1366, when she was 19 years old she reported her first vision of Jesus after which she started to tend to the sick and the poor. In 1370 she reported a vision in which she was commanded to abandon her life of solitude and to make an impact on the world. She corresponded with Pope Gregory XI and other people in authority, begging for peace and for the reformation of the clergy, writing over 300 letters. Her arguments, and her trip to Avignon, eventually became instrumental in the decision of Pope Gregory XI to return the Avignon Papacy to Rome where she was summoned to live until her death. She is one of only three female Doctors of the Church. In 1372, Saint Julian of Norwich was on her deathbed and had been given her last rites when she reported a series of visions of Jesus, followed by a sudden recovery. Almost twenty years later she wrote about these visions in her book \\"Revelations of Divine Love‚Äù perhaps the first book in the English language written by a woman, presumably because she was unfamiliar with Latin. Her book mentions her illness and her recovery as she saw the shining image of Christ. The sixteen revelations start with the crown of thorns and proceed through the death of Jesus, ending with his resurrection and how Christ still dwells in the souls of those who love him. She is celebrated in the Anglican Church. On St. Peter's Day in 1559, Saint Teresa of Avila (Teresa de Jes√∫s) reported a vision of Jesus present to her in bodily form. For almost two years thereafter she reported similar visions. Saint Teresa's visions transformed her life and she became a key figure in the Catholic Church eventually being recognized as one of only three female Doctors of the Church. One of her visions is the subject of Bernini's famous work The Ecstasy of Saint Teresa in the basilica of Santa Maria della Vittoria, Rome. In the early 17th century, Venerable Mar√≠a de Jes√∫s de √Ågreda reported a number of mystical experiences, visions and conversations with the Blessed Virgin Mary. She stated that the Blessed Virgin had inspired and dictated passages in the book Mystical City of God as a biography of the Virgin Mary. The book Mystical City of God is still frequently studied in college and university programs of Spanish language and culture. However, the book (which makes a number of somewhat unusual claims) has remained controversial within the Roman Catholic church, having been banned and restored a number of times, and her process of beatification (started in 1673) has not been completed.Gies, David Thatcher. The Cambridge history of Spanish literature, Cambridge University Press, 2004 page 157Perry, Tim S. Mary for Evangelicals, InterVarsity Press, 2006 page 228 From 1673 to 1675, Saint Marguerite Marie Alacoque recounted a series of visions of Christ speaking to her. In December 1673 she reported that Jesus permitted her to rest her head upon his heart, and then disclosed to her the wonders of his love. This led her to the founding of the Devotion of the Sacred Heart. Initially, her life, actions, beliefs and writings became the subject of extreme scrutiny by the Catholic Church. However, she was eventually declared a saint in 1920 and the Feast of the Sacred Heart is now officially celebrated 19 days after Pentecost. At her profession as a Capuchin Poor Clare nun in 1678, Saint Veronica Giuliani expressed a great desire to suffer in union with the crucified Jesus for the conversion of sinners.Hess, Lawrence. \\"St. Veronica Giuliani.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 17 Jul. 2013 Shortly after that time she reported a series of vision of Jesus and the Virgin Mary that lasted a number of years. She reported a vision of Christ bearing his cross and of the chalice symbolizing the Passion of Christ. On Good Friday 1697 she received the five wounds of Christ as stigmata.  19th-century visions  The House of the Virgin Mary on Ephesus, Turkey. Blessed Anne Catherine Emmerich was a German Augustinian nun who lived from 1774 to 1824. She was bedridden as of 1813 and is said to have had visible stigmata which would reopen on Good Friday. She reported that since childhood she had visions in which she talked with Jesus. In 1819 the poet Clemens Brentano was inspired to visit her and began to write her visions in his words, with her approval. In 1833, after her death, the book The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ was released by Brentano and was used in part by Mel Gibson for his movie The Passion of the Christ in 2004. In 1852 the book The Life of The Blessed Virgin Mary was published. Emmerich's visions allegedly led a French priest Abb√© Julien Gouyet to discover a house near Ephesus in Turkey in 1881. This house is assumed by some Catholics and some Muslims to be the House of the Virgin Mary. The Holy See has taken no official position on the authenticity of the discovery yet, but in 1896 Pope Leo XIII visited it and in 1951 Pope Pius XII initially declared the house a Holy Place. Pope John XXIII later made the declaration permanent. Pope Paul VI in 1967, Pope John Paul II in 1979 and Pope Benedict XVI in 2006 visited the house. In 1820, Joseph Smith, Jr., founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, reported that the Father and the Son appeared to him in a vision in the woods near his home in rural New York. This led to a series of other manifestations through which he claimed to receive divine instruction, authority, and power to restore the true Church of Jesus Christ to the world. He also claimed to receive a vision of Jesus while in the Kirtland Temple on April 3, 1836. His record of the revelation has since become known as the 110th section of the Doctrine and Covenants. Secondo Pia's 1898 negative of the image on the Shroud of Turin, used in the devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus. In 1843 Sister Marie of St Peter, a Carmelite nun in Tours, France reported visions of conversations with Jesus and the Virgin Mary in which she was urged to spread the devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus, in reparation for the many insults Jesus suffered in his Passion. This resulted in the Golden Arrow Prayer.Ball, Ann. 2003 Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices pages 635 and 239 The devotion was further spread from Tours partly by the efforts of the Venerable Leo Dupont (also called the Apostle of the Holy Face) and influenced Saint Therese of Lisieux.Cruz OCDS, Joan Carroll. Saintly Men of Modern Times, 2003, page 200 The Venerable Marie Martha Chambon. In December 1844, Ellen Gould Harmon (later married name White), co-founder of the Seventh Day Adventist movement, while kneeling at a prayer meeting at the house of Mrs. Haines on Ocean Street in South Portland, Maine, experienced a vision of Jesus Christ. Ellen felt the power of God come upon her and was soon lost to her surroundings. She experienced over one hundred visions which she published as broadside, letters, or incorporated into her religious writings. The Seventh- day Adventist Church, which by 2000 had 18 million modern world-wide followers, is based largely on her interpretations of Christian subjects found in her numerous writings. She was one of the most prolific American women of the nineteenth century, while founding numerous schools, hospitals, medical centers and universities. The Smithsonian Magazine has named her as one of the most significant Americans of all time.Spalding, Arthur W.1947 \\"Footsteps of the Pioneers\\" page 22-23. For recent scholarship, see Terrie Dopp Aamodt, Gary Land and Ronald L. Numbers, Ellen Harmon White: American Prophet (Oxford, 2015). In 1858 Saint Bernadette Soubirous was a 14-year-old shepherd girl who lived near the town of Lourdes in France. One day she reported a vision of a miraculous Lady who identified Herself as the Virgin Mary in subsequent visions.Jestice, Phyllis G. Holy people of the world: a cross-cultural encyclopedia, Volume 3, 2004 page 816 In the first vision she was asked to return again and she had 18 visions overall. Eventually, a number of chapels and churches were built at Lourdes as the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes - which is now a major Catholic pilgrimage site. One of these churches, the Basilica of St. Pius X can accommodate 25 thousand people and was dedicated by the future Pope John XXIII when he was the Papal Nuncio to France. In 1866 Venerable Marie Martha Chambon began to report visions of Jesus telling her to contemplate the Holy Wounds, although it is said that she had received her first vision when only five years old. page 80 She was a member of the Monastery of the Visitation Order who lived in Chamb√©ry, France, and is in the process of canonization by the Roman Catholic Church. In 1899 Saint Gemma Galgani reported a vision of Jesus after which she experienced recurring stigmata. She reported the vision as follows: ‚ÄúAt that moment Jesus appeared with all his wounds open, but from these wounds there no longer came forth blood, but flames of fire. In an instant these flames came to touch my hands, my feet and my heart.‚Äù Thereafter she reported receiving the stigmata every week from Thursday night to Saturday morning, during which time she also reported further conversations with Jesus. The Congregation of Rites has so far refrained from making a decision on her stigmata.  20th-century visionaries  The Franciscan Italian priest Saint Pio of Pietrelcina reported visions of both Jesus and Mary as early as 1910. For a number of years he claimed to have experienced deep ecstasy along with his visions. In 1918, while praying in the Church of Our Lady of Grace he reported ecstasy and visions which this time left him with permanent and visible stigmata, the five wounds of Christ. The stigmata remained visible on his hands and feet for the next fifty years. Marie Julie Jahenny known as \\"The mystic of La Fraudais\\". In 1916, during World War I, Claire Ferchaud ‚Äî a religious Sister Claire of Jesus Crucified ‚Äî lived in the Convent of the ‚ÄòRinfili√®res‚Äô at Loublande, France. At that time, she claimed to have been given a vision of Christ himself showing his heart \\"slashed by the sins of mankind\\" and crossed by a deeper wound still, atheism. On 12 March 1920, however, a decree of the Holy Office disavowed her revelations and stated that belief in the visions of Loublande could not be approved. The Archbishop of Paris, Cardinal L√©on-Adolphe Amette declared that regretfully he was unable to discover a supernatural inspiration in her statements.Jacques Benoist, Le Sacr√©-Coeur des femmes, de 1870 √† 1960, Editions de l'Atelier, 2000, p. 1560 (in french.) The visions of the Virgin Mary appearing to three shepherd children at F√°tima, Portugal, in 1917 were declared \\"worthy of belief\\" by the Catholic Church in 1930 but Catholics at large are not formally required to believe them. However, seven popes ‚Äî Pius XII, John XXIII, Paul VI, John Paul I, John Paul II, Benedict XVI and Francis ‚Äî have supported the F√°tima messages as supernatural. John Paul I met with Sister L√∫cia on July 11, 1977 while he was still Cardinal Patriarch of Venice. He reported being deeply moved by the experience, and vowed to perform the Consecration of Russia as Lucia said Mary had asked.Camillo Bassotto, My Heart Is Still in Venice (Krinon, 1990), p. 113. Pope John Paul II was particularly attached to F√°tima and credited Our Lady of F√°tima with saving his life after he was shot in Rome on the Feast Day of Our Lady of F√°tima in May 1981. He donated the bullet that wounded him on that day to the Roman Catholic Sanctuary of F√°tima, in Portugal. Every year on May 13 and October 13, the significant dates of F√°tima apparitions, pilgrims fill the country road that leads to the Sanctuary of Our Lady of F√°tima with crowds that approach one million on each day.Trudy Ring, 1996, International Dictionary of Historic Places, page 245 Faustina Kowalska. The Holy See has, at times, reversed its position on some visions. In 1931 Saint Faustina Kowalska reported visions of a conversation with Jesus when she was a Polish nun. This resulted in the Chaplet of Divine Mercy as a prayer and later an institution which was condemned by the Holy See in 1958. However, further investigation resulted in her beatification in 1993 and canonization in 2000. Her conversations with Jesus are recorded in her diary, published as \\"Divine Mercy in My Soul\\" - passages from which are at times quoted by the Vatican. Divine Mercy Sunday is now officially celebrated as the first Sunday after Easter. On the first Friday in Lent 1936, Sister Maria Pierina De Micheli, a nun born near Milan in Italy, reported a vision in which Jesus told her: ‚ÄúI will that My Face, which reflects the intimate pains of My Spirit, the suffering and the love of My Heart, be more honored. He who meditates upon Me, consoles Me‚Äù. Further visions reportedly urged her to make a medal with the Holy Face. In 1958, Pope Pius XII confirmed the Feast of the Holy Face of Jesus as Shrove Tuesday (the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday) for all Roman Catholics. Maria Pierina De Micheli was beatified by Benedict XVI in 2009.Catholic News Agency From 1944 to 1947 the bed ridden Italian writer and mystic Maria Valtorta produced 15,000 handwritten pages of text that she said recorded the visions of her conversations with Jesus about his life and the early church. These pages became the basis of her book The Poem of the Man God. The Catholic Church placed it on the Index of Forbidden Books. While the Index no longer exists, the then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger stated in a letter of January 31, 1995 that the condemnation still \\"retains its moral force\\", and the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith declared that the visions \\"cannot be considered supernatural in origin.\\" Cross of Dozul√© in the place of its famous first apparition to Madeleine Aumount in 1972.

Les Nouvelles Editions Latines, Paris. a mother of five children, in the presence of her parish priest Victor L‚ÄôHorset and other faithful people, and is believed to have dictated a series of messages, containing teachings and of warnings for all people, according to those who believe in them. Among them is the daily ¬´Prayer of Dozul√©¬ª.Jean Stiegler; Prayers in Dozul√©. 48 pp. Editions R√©siac, France. The messages are seen as an annunciation of the return of Christ. The followers of the messages of Dozul√© believe also that they are the continuation of the Three Secrets of F√°tima and that they ask, for the conversion of humanity to avoid a material and spiritual catastrophe.  Living visionaries  Among recent visions, the reported apparitions of The Virgin Mary to six children in Meƒëugorje in 1981 have received the widest amount of attention. The messages of Our Lady of Meƒëugorje have a very strong following among Catholics worldwide. The Holy See has never officially either approved or disapproved of the messages of Meƒëugorje, although both critical and supportive documents about the messages have been published by various Catholic figures. For several decades, Sister Agnes Katsuko Sasagawa had encountered many health problems but her health reportedly improved after drinking water from Lourdes. After going totally deaf, she went to live with the nuns in the remote area of Yuzawadai, near the city of Akita. In 1973 she reported messages from the Virgin Mary, as well as stigmata. These purported visions are known as Our Lady of Akita. On April 22, 1984, after eight years of investigations, Rev. John Shojiro Ito, Bishop of Niigata, Japan, recognized \\"the supernatural character of a series of mysterious events concerning the statue of the Holy Mother Mary\\" and authorizes \\"throughout the entire diocese, the veneration of the Holy Mother of Akita, while awaiting that the Holy See publishes definitive judgment on this matter.\\"\\"The Apparitions of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Akita, Japan, to Sr. Agnes Sasagawa\\" Meeting of Vassula Ryden with the Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI) in the offices of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (Vatican, November 22, 2004) As recently as 1985 other people such as Vassula Ryden have reported conversations of theirs with Jesus in their books, resulting in interest, discussion and controversy. Ryden's reported conversations with Jesus are published in a series of books called ‚ÄúTrue Life in God‚Äù and have been translated into over 40 languages by volunteers worldwide. In a 1995 notification the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, while recognizing some positive aspects of Ryden's activities, declared that their negative effects meant that dioceses should not provide opportunities for spreading her ideas and that Catholics should not consider her writings to be supernatural.Notification of 6 October 1995 A further letter from the Congregation written on January 25, 2007, by the new Prefect Cardinal William Levada and this time sent worldwide to all the Catholic episcopal conferences, confirmed the 1995 negative doctrinal evaluation of the writings of which it spoke; stated that, in view of the clarifications offered, a case by case judgement should be passed on the possibility for Catholics to read her writings \\"presented not as divine revelations but rather as her personal meditations\\"; and declared it inappropriate for Catholics to participate in her prayer groups.Circular letter to the presidents of the episcopal conferences regarding the writings and activities of Mrs Vassula Ryd√©n In the book Visions of Jesus Phillip Wiebe chronicled the stories of 30 people from truly diverse backgrounds who claim to have had recent conversations with Jesus. Wiebe analyzed these claims from multiple perspectives, including hallucinations, dreams and real visions.Phillip H. Wiebe 1998 Visions of Jesus Oxford University Press Types of visions  = Visions vs dictations = Some visionaries merely report conversations and images while others also produce large amounts of handwritten notes. Saint Julian of Norwich wrote a book based on her reported visions, the book was written 20 years after her first vision and she did not declare it to be a dictation. At the other end of the spectrum is the case of Blessed Anne Catherine Emmerich who narrated her messages to Klemens Brentano, who transcribed them in his own words. Another case was that of Sister Consolata Betrone who would repeat her reported conversations with Jesus to her confessor Father Lorenzo Sales. After her death, Father Sales wrote the book \\"Jesus Appeals to the World\\" based on her reported messages.Father Lorenzo Sales, 1955 Jesus Appeals to the World: From the Writings of Sr. Consolata Betrone Alba House Publishers There have been other mystics who have produced large volumes of text, but considered them meditations rather than visions or interior locutions. For instance, the Venerable Concepcion Cabrera de Armida's over 60,000 pages of text were never represented as visions, but as her own meditations, often in the presence of the Blessed Sacrament, during Eucharistic Adoration. = Physical marks = A young Padre Pio with stigmata Some visionaries report receiving physical signs on their bodies. Saint Francis of Assisi was one of the first reported cases of stigmata, but the best known recent example is a Capuchin, Saint Padre Pio, one of several Franciscans in history with reported stigmata.Michael Freze, 1989, They Bore the Wounds of Christ: The Mystery of the Sacred Stigmata, OSV Publishing page 255. = Physical contact = Some visionaries have reported physical contact with Jesus. The Bible suggests that post-resurrection (yet pre-ascension) physical contact with Jesus is possible, for in John 21:17 Jesus told Saint Mary Magdalene: ‚ÄùDon‚Äôt touch Me for I have not yet ascended to the Father‚Äù. In John 20:27 Jesus ordered Saint Thomas the Apostle: ‚ÄúPut your hand into My side‚Äù. But the Bible does not mention if Saint Thomas followed that command. Saint Marguerite Marie Alacoque reported putting her head on the heart of Jesus. = Physical artifacts = Our Lady of Guadalupe. Some visionaries produce artifacts based on their reported visions, although this is rare. In 1531, Saint Juan Diego reported an early morning vision of the Blessed Virgin Mary in which he was instructed to build an abbey on the Hill of Tepeyac in Mexico. The local prelate did not believe his account and asked for a miraculous sign, which was later provided as an icon of Our Lady of Guadalupe permanently imprinted on the saint's cloak where he had gathered roses. Over the years, Our Lady of Guadalupe became a symbol of the Catholic faith in Mexico. By 1820 when the Mexican War of Independence from Spanish colonial rule ended Our Lady of Guadalupe had come to symbolize the Mexican nation. Today it remains a strong national and religious symbol in Mexico.

He was a professor of anthropology at Northwestern University. Early life and education Struever was born in Peru, Illinois on August 4, 1931, the son of manager of the American Nickeloid Company. He attended Dartmouth College, majoring in English and graduating in 1959. His graduate work was done at the University of Chicago, where he pursued his interests in the Hopewell Tradition of the Middle Woodland period in the American midwest. He was a well-published researcher before he earned his PhD in 1968 under the supervision of Lewis Binford. Career After completing his doctorate at the University of Chicago, Struever joined the Dept. of Anthropology at Northwestern University where he taught for most of his career and served as chairman for many years. Into the early 1970s he continued to be an active researcher, publishing on topics including settlement pattern, early agriculture, and trade. By the mid-1970s he had begun to focus mainly on leadership of the Foundation for Illinois Archeology (later renamed the Center for American Archeology or CAA), headquartered in Kampsville, Illinois. (This center used the \\"archeology\\" spelling although the conventional spelling is \\"archaeology.\\") The CAA grew rapidly throughout the 1970s, converting many buildings in Kampsville into archaeology laboratories and offices. With the CAA Struever developed the model of using archaeological education to generate funding to support a large multi-disciplinary archaeology research center. Education was provided mainly through numerous field schools, including a university-level field school operated in conjunction with Northwestern University and programs for high-schoolers and adults. The profile of the foundation was raised enormously with its large- scale excavation at the Koster Site in Greene County, Illinois. Initial research at this site was focused on Woodland period remains near the surface, but test pits encountered fourteen cultural levels or \\"horizons\\", dating back to the early Archaic period. Beginning in 1968, excavations at Koster expanded into one of the largest archaeological projects in the country by the mid-1970s. Several hundred college students worked at the site. It was featured in various national magazines and documentaries before excavations ended in 1979. In the 1980s Struever retired from Northwestern and the CAA and moved to Colorado, becoming president of the Crow Canyon Archaeological Center in Cortez. Struever married Indian art dealer and scholar, Martha Hopkins Struever in 1988. He retired from Crow Canyon in 1992, and remained in Colorado. Struever received a Distinguished Service Award in 1995, followed by a Presidential Recognition Award in 2003, from the Society for American Archaeology. Dr. Struever currently resides in Santa Fe. Contributions Struever is best known for accomplishments in three areas: * The New Archaeology Struever was a graduate student in the Dept. of Anthropology at University of Chicago when a sea change was occurring in anthropological archaeology; in a movement that came to be called the New Archaeology, the prevailing concern with prehistoric culture history was being replaced with more theoretical concerns about ancient societies (Willey and Sabloff 1974). The New Archaeology was spearheaded by Lewis Binford, who was Struever's dissertation advisor. Struever was an active and innovative contributor to this body of research, with publications such as \\"Woodland subsistence- settlement systems in the lower Illinois Valley\\" (Struever 1968a). * Woodland Period Archaeology Struever excavated several Woodland period sites in the Lower Illinois Valley and wrote extensively on this period in prehistory. His topics included culture history (Struever 1965), ancient agriculture (Struever and Vickery 1973), and methods of recovering small scale remains through flotation (Struever 1968b), * Large-Scale, Public-Oriented Archaeology Struever realized that the more intellectually ambitious questions being asked by the New Archaeology could not be answered without much broader and richer data on ancient life than archaeologists usually collected, including analyses of ancient plant and animal use, soils, and climate. He made this case in an important 1971 article (Struever 1971), and at the same time he was actively working to build the Center for Illinois Archeology into the sort of large- scale multi-disciplinary research program that he had advocated. Struever had in effect given up his career as a researcher within a few years, in order to devote his time to directing the CIA and later the Crow Canyon Archaeological Center. These centers both generated funding through field schools and a range of other educational programs. A charismatic personality, Struever was an accomplished fund-raiser and spokesman for American archaeology during the 1970s and 1980s; he appeared in national media, wrote widely read books for the public (Struever and Holton 1979) and produced documentaries (Struever 1970).

It is usually considered myeloid-specific, but it can also be found on some lymphoid cells. It binds sialic acids, therefore is a member of the SIGLEC family of lectins. Structure The extracellular portion of this receptor contains two immunoglobulin domains (one IgV and one IgC2 domain), placing CD33 within the immunoglobulin superfamily. The intracellular portion of CD33 contains immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) that are implicated in inhibition of cellular activity.Myeloid cell surface antigen CD33 precursor - Homo sapiens (Human)  Function  CD33 can be stimulated by any molecule with sialic acid residues such as glycoproteins or glycolipids. Upon binding, the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) of CD33, present on the cytosolic portion of the protein, is phosphorylated and acts as a docking site for Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing proteins like SHP phosphatases. This results in a cascade that inhibits phagocytosis in the cell. Clinical significance CD33 is the target of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (trade name: Mylotarg¬Æ; Pfizer/Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories), an Antibody-drug conjugate for the treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

Delbet is remembered for his advocacy of magnesium chloride. During World War I, Delbet was searching for a solution that could cleanse wounds but not damage tissue as traditional antiseptics did. In 1915 he found that magnesium chloride not only worked as an antiseptic, but was also harmless to body tissue. Serendipitously, he discovered that when the magnesium chloride solution was taken orally or intravenously, it appeared to be a remedy for other ailments. Delbet also believed that magnesium was beneficial to the efficiency of white blood cells, of which he described in his treatise \\"Politique Pr√©ventive du Cancer\\".

Completed in 1972 as headquarters of the Continental Insurance Company, the building is among the earlier of San Francisco's modern skyscrapers. By the start of the dot-com bubble the property, then owned by Grosvenor Properties, was outdated and suffered from deferred capital maintenance. In 1997, the building was purchased by Walton Capital, which invested heavily in upgrades, re-measured the building at larger than before, then aggressively re-leased space at higher rates. After two failed transactions, Walton Capital sold the building to investors led by Unico Properties in May 2000 for US$156 million. Unico re-sold the property to the Alaska Permanent Fund based on a US$149 million price in August 2005, but retained a minority ownership share. The property was acquired by the Rockpoint Group in February 2017 for US$287.5 million. Tenants The tower houses many daytime office workers. Major tenants include the New York Life Insurance Company. As of 2016, it is tied with 45 Fremont Center as the twenty-sixth tallest building in San Francisco.

Henri Fournier, built at Gironde (initially ordered by Romania) Forges et Chantiers de la Gironde (literally translated Forges and dockyards of the Gironde) was a French shipbuilder at Lormont near Bordeaux on the Gironde estuary. The company was previously called Usine de construction navale Chaigneau et Bichon, then Chantiers et Ateliers de la Gironde S.A. Ets Schneider, before becoming Forges et Chantiers de la Gironde. It is today the Construction Navale de Bordeaux (CNB). Ships The company built naval ships.

In June 1939 the yard had launched another Bougainville class aviso, the Beautemps Beaupr√©. At the Fall of France she was still being completed at the yard so on 24 June 1940 the French took her out into the Gironde and scuttled her to prevent her from being captured. Another Bougainville class aviso, La P√©rouse, was on order at the time but was cancelled. On 11 November 1939 the French government ordered twelve s including three from Forges et Chantiers de la Gironde. After the Fall of France the company abandoned construction of two of these, La Rieuse and La S√©rieuse, and suspended work on the third, which had been intended to be La Preneuse. Work on her resumed after 1945 and her intended name was changed to Commandant Ducuing in 1946. However, construction was finally abandoned in 1948.

The National Park Service rustic style barn is 5 miles (8 km) west of Jenny Lake in Grand Teton National Park in the U.S. state of Wyoming. The rustic log cabin features saddle-notched log corners on a stone foundation. The foundation is buttressed at the corners to support the projecting log ends, a feature typical of Park Service designs of the era. The original wide barn door has been filled in with windows and a personnel door. The interior consists of a large main room with a small tack room in the southwest corner, now used for tool storage. The partition uses vertical poles faced with 4-1/2: wide tongue and groove planks. The room is furnished with built-in cupboards and a wood-burning cookstove. A loft is framed with logs and 8\\" rough-cut decking, reached by a milled-lumber stairway. The loft deck is covered with 6\\" wide flooring planks. The roof structure is open to the underside of the roof, with exposed log trusses. Positioned deep in Cascade Canyon, the cabin was originally used as a barn, but after an avalanche destroyed the Cascade Canyon patrol cabin in 1960, the barn was converted to a patrol cabin. It shares a common design and purpose with the Death Canyon Barn to the south in the park, with minor differences attributable to available materials and the preferences of the work crews building the barns. Crews from either CCC Hot Springs camp NP3 or Jenny Lake Camp NP 4 built the barn. On August 18, 1998, the barn was listed on the National Register of Historical Places.

Wainui is approximately 5.5 kilometres north-east of Waitoki and 10 km west of Orewa. The Wainui Stream flows south-west through the area, and exits into the Kaukapakapa River. History Wainui is an old established area which saw people with English, Scottish and Irish roots settle around 1850. Among the first settlers were two farmers, Hutson and Thick followed by King, Lloyd and Jacobs. About 1860 the Lambert, Lamont, Fennell and Scott families started to clear further land for cultivation. When these settlers arrived Wainui consisted of teatree and fern with fairly extensive areas in virgin bush including magnificent kauris. The two main means of livelihood open to the settlers at that time were timber and gumdigging. Demographics The statistical area of Wainui-Waiwera, which at 79 square kilometres is much larger than this locality, had a population of 1,674 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 261 people (18.5%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 348 people (26.2%) since the 2006 census. There were 612 households. There were 834 males and 840 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.99 males per female. The median age was 45.6 years, with 291 people (17.4%) aged under 15 years, 276 (16.5%) aged 15 to 29, 819 (48.9%) aged 30 to 64, and 288 (17.2%) aged 65 or older. Ethnicities were 93.0% European/PƒÅkehƒÅ, 9.0% MƒÅori, 2.0% Pacific peoples, 3.8% Asian, and 1.4% other ethnicities (totals add to more than 100% since people could identify with multiple ethnicities). The proportion of people born overseas was 25.6%, compared with 27.1% nationally. Although some people objected to giving their religion, 53.2% had no religion, 35.7% were Christian, and 3.9% had other religions. Of those at least 15 years old, 294 (21.3%) people had a bachelor or higher degree, and 162 (11.7%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $37,400. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 711 (51.4%) people were employed full-time, 285 (20.6%) were part-time, and 39 (2.8%) were unemployed. Education Wainui School is a coeducational full primary (years 1-8) school with a roll of students as of The school opened in 1879 and celebrated its 125th anniversary in 2004. As early as the 1860s formal schooling was conducted, not in a schoolroom, but in the teacher‚Äôs own home. In 1870 the local Presbyterian church was built which is depicted on the Wainui School logo. By 1878 the need for a school was obvious so the schoolhouse was built, then the first classroom opened its door at the beginning of 1879 but the head teacher had to be shared with another school (Locknorrie) so schooling only lasted until lunchtime. It wasn‚Äôt until 1912 that Wainui became a full-time school with a roll of 20 pupils. At this time there was no transport to the nearest high school so pupils stayed on until they were 15 years of age. By 1946 another classroom was required as the roll had risen to 60 pupils and with more farms being developed in the area this was to be a continuing theme. In 1969, the original old school room had become redundant as new classrooms were built. This building was removed from the school grounds. The original school room is now part of the Museum of Transport and Technology in Auckland. Over the proceeding years the roll has continued to grow and with more farms being sub-divided this will be a continuing trend. By the beginning of the new millennium the school had reached 200. While traditionally a farming area, the make-up of the area has changed somewhat. Most of the contributing families are now small holding ‚Äúlife-style block‚Äù owners, working in the local area, the North Shore or Auckland city.

On average, from 2013 to 2017, more than 120,000 passengers used the airport annually. Refers to \\"Regular Public Transport (RPT) operations only\\"  Background  Geraldton Airport is the general aviation and regular passenger transport airport for the City of Greater Geraldton and it meets varying transport, industrial and commercial interests across the Mid West region. Geraldton Airport is the main regional base for aircraft charter operations, flight training, private flying, aerial and agricultural work and aircraft maintenance in the Mid West region. The closest significant aerodromes are Mullewa, to the east or Kalbarri to the north and for larger jet operations Perth Airport, to the south. Geraldton Airport has daily Regular Public Transport (RPT) services to and from Perth, provided by QantasLink using Fokker 100 aircraft. Geraldton Airport is the base for several general aviation flying training and charter operators, namely; * Geraldton Air Charter, who purchased Abrolhos Air Services in 2002 and incorporated into business. * Batavia Coast Air Charter * Shine Aviation Services * Mid West Aero Club * OM Helicopters Shine Aviation Services conduct flying training and utilise a gazetted low flying training area to the south east of the airport. Shine Aviation Services are also a major fly-in fly-out operator in the region. Midwest Aviation conduct aircraft maintenance and have aircraft engineers. Bristow Helicopters provide offshore support services to drill companies exploring offshore from Dongara. Dunns Aerial Spraying & Spreading Service provides crop dusting services from the airport for up to nine months of each year. The Royal Flying Doctor Service in Western Australia utilises the airport on an as-required basis and has an aircraft hangar which is vested in the City of Greater Geraldton adjacent to the general aviation terminal. Local charter operations from Geraldton Airport providing fly-in fly-out services include Shine Aviation to Golden Grove Mine, Mount Magnet and Jack Hills. Virgin Australia operates to Boolgeeda Airport from Geraldton on a Wednesday, and Network Aviation (branded as QantasLink), Cobham Aviation Services Australia and Skippers Aviation operate charters to various sites on a non regular basis. Fixed wing and helicopter charters to the Abrolhos Islands are also well patronised. Geraldton is close enough to Perth to receive a significant number of private operations from aircraft based in Perth. Geraldton is also a convenient location for pilots to fly to for recreational reasons. Flying training squadrons from RAAF Base Pearce also use Geraldton Airport. They pay regular visits with Pilatus PC-9 training aircraft often staying overnight conducting circuits and cross-country navigation exercises. C130 Hercules transport aircraft also use Geraldton Airport for training on occasions throughout the year. Qantas B737-800 aircraft VH-XZJ \\"Mendoowoorrji\\" at Geraldton Airport.

History - WWII  From 1941 to 1945, Geraldton was the site of No. 4 Service Flying Training School RAAF during World War II. It was formed in February 1941 and commenced flying the following month, responsible for intermediate and advanced instruction of pilots under the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS). The school operated Avro Anson aircraft and by November 1941, two Fairey Battles and two de Havilland Fox Moths also operated at No. 4 SFTS. In August 1943, No. 4 SFTS had a visit from an Avro Lancaster, \\"Queenie VI\\". Two reserve squadrons were formed in response to the outbreak of war in the Pacific, though they never saw action. Flying activity was reduced towards the end of 1943, and the school was disbanded in May 1945, having graduated over 1,000 pilots. It re-formed as No. 87 Operational Base Unit, which was renamed Care and Maintenance Unit (CMU) Geraldton in May 1946. CMU Geraldton was disbanded in September 1947.  2018-2019 Airport Expansion Project  In 2019, the City of Greater Geraldton completed a $24 million project to expand the capacity of Geraldton Airport, with works that commenced in November 2018. The expansion project included the renewal and upgrade of the existing runway, taxiway and apron pavements as well as extension of the main runway to 2,389 metres and expansion of the main apron to accommodate larger aircraft such as the A330 and B787. Geraldton Airport will also have greater capacity as an alternative landing port for Perth Airport in case of fog or bad weather events. The City also stated that the expansion will enable development of direct interstate and international services for tourism and airfreight, and should give the private sector greater confidence to invest in Geraldton. The expansion of Geraldton Airport commenced November 2019 and was completed in June 2019, with WBHO Infrastructure being awarded the construction contract. Funding for the project consisted of: * $7.5 million contributed by the City of Greater Geraldton * $6.5 million contributed by the Western Australian State Government * $10 million contributed by the Australian Government through the Building Better Regions Fund The airport runway extensions were officially opened on Friday 6 September 2019 by Federal Member for Durack the Hon.

As the names states, it serves members in Northern California, Nevada, and Utah. It is headquartered in Walnut Creek, California. History The California State Automobile Association traces its history to a 1900 meeting of car buffs in San Francisco's Cliff House. Recognizing the need for better roads (America had very few paved roadways outside of cities), signage, and more friendly laws, those car owners formed the Automobile Club of California (ACC) to deal with barriers that hindered acceptance of the auto throughout the state. The club‚Äôs efforts began to pay off in 1905, when the legislature passed a set of uniform regulations governing the use of motor vehicles on California highways. This established the state, rather than individual local jurisdictions, as the authority on motor vehicle law and did away with a jumble of local regulations. The 1907 logo of the California State Automobile Association 1907 was the year that California State Automobile Association officially incorporated in California as Non-Profit Mutual Benefit Corporation, affiliation with the American Automobile Association (AAA) however did not happen until after AAA itself officially incorporated in 1910 in the State of Connecticut. The new club‚Äôs (stated) focus was ‚ÄúGood Roads and Just Legislation.‚Äù 1909 CSAA highway map CSAA sent teams of cartographers to survey California's roads for the production of maps, with the first ones produced in 1909. The organization also helped post thousands of porcelain-on- steel traffic signs throughout the state and continued to do so until the State of California took over the task in the early 1950s. CSAA began to offer automobile insurance in 1913 and homeowner's insurance in 1974. In 1933, CSAA opened its first office in Nevada, and thereafter became the designated AAA affiliate in that state. In 1994, CSAA acquired the Automobile Club of Utah. In 2005, CSAA and AAA Arizona announced they would affiliate under a shared holding company, AAA Club Affiliates.Arizona, California AAA clubs form partnership By 2006, AAA Club Affiliates counted AAA MountainWest, AAA Oklahoma/South Dakota, and the Hoosier Motor Club as members.

This name change took effect in February 2011, which was reflected in their December 15, 2010 corporate amendments filed with the California Secretary of State. In 2010, there was a reported split of the insurance and auto club operations, with the auto club remaining a non-profit mutual benefit corporation, while the insurance side became a not-for-profit entity.AAA unit splits off nonprofit club The next year, the auto club moved its headquarters to Emeryville.AAA to move hundreds of jobs to Emeryville In 2013, the insurance company changed its name to CSAA Insurance Group, a AAA Insurer.

It represents a chain of particles with exponential potential interaction between neighbors. These concepts are named after Morikazu Toda. The Toda oscillator is used as a simple model to understand the phenomenon of self-pulsation, which is a quasi-periodic pulsation of the output intensity of a solid-state laser in the transient regime.  Definition  The Toda oscillator is a dynamical system of any origin, which can be described with dependent coordinate ~x~ and independent coordinate ~z~, characterized in that the evolution along independent coordinate ~z~ can be approximated with equation : \\\\frac{{\\\\rm d^{2}}x}{{\\\\rm d}z^{2}}+ D(x)\\\\frac{{\\\\rm d}x}{{\\\\rm d}z}+ \\\\Phi'(x) =0, where ~D(x)=u e^{x}+v~, ~\\\\Phi(x)=e^x-x-1~ and prime denotes the derivative.  Physical meaning  The independent coordinate ~z~ has sense of time. Indeed, it may be proportional to time ~t~ with some relation like ~z=t/t_0~, where ~t_0~ is constant. The derivative ~\\\\dot x=\\\\frac{{\\\\rm d}x}{{\\\\rm d}z} may have sense of velocity of particle with coordinate ~x~; then ~\\\\ddot x=\\\\frac{{\\\\rm d}^2x}{{\\\\rm d}z^2}~ can be interpreted as acceleration; and the mass of such a particle is equal to unity. The dissipative function ~D~ may have sense of coefficient of the speed-proportional friction. Usually, both parameters ~u~ and ~v~ are supposed to be positive; then this speed-proportional friction coefficient grows exponentially at large positive values of coordinate ~x~. The potential ~\\\\Phi(x)=e^x-x-1~ is a fixed function, which also shows exponential growth at large positive values of coordinate ~x~. In the application in laser physics, ~x~ may have a sense of logarithm of number of photons in the laser cavity, related to its steady-state value. Then, the output power of such a laser is proportional to ~\\\\exp(x)~ and may show pulsation at oscillation of ~x~. Both analogies, with a unity mass particle and logarithm of number of photons, are useful in the analysis of behavior of the Toda oscillator. Energy Rigorously, the oscillation is periodic only at ~u=v=0~. Indeed, in the realization of the Toda oscillator as a self- pulsing laser, these parameters may have values of order of ~10^{-4}~; during several pulses, the amplitude of pulsation does not change much. In this case, we can speak about the period of pulsation, since the function ~x=x(t)~ is almost periodic. In the case ~u=v=0~, the energy of the oscillator ~E=\\\\frac 12 \\\\left(\\\\frac{{\\\\rm d}x}{{\\\\rm d}z}\\\\right)^{2}+\\\\Phi(x)~ does not depend on ~z~, and can be treated as a constant of motion. Then, during one period of pulsation, the relation between ~x~ and ~z~ can be expressed analytically: : z=\\\\pm\\\\int_{x_\\\\min}^{x_\\\\max}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\frac{{\\\\rm d}a} {\\\\sqrt{2}\\\\sqrt{E-\\\\Phi(a)}} where ~x_{\\\\min}~ and ~x_{\\\\max}~ are minimal and maximal values of ~x~; this solution is written for the case when \\\\dot x(0)=0. however, other solutions may be obtained using the principle of translational invariance. The ratio ~x_\\\\max/x_\\\\min=2\\\\gamma~ is a convenient parameter to characterize the amplitude of pulsation. Using this, we can express the median value \\\\delta=\\\\frac{x_\\\\max -x_\\\\min}{1} as \\\\delta= \\\\ln\\\\frac{\\\\sin(\\\\gamma)}{\\\\gamma} ; and the energy E=E(\\\\gamma)=\\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{\\\\tanh(\\\\gamma)}+\\\\ln\\\\frac{\\\\sinh \\\\gamma}{\\\\gamma}-1 is also an elementary function of ~\\\\gamma~. In application, the quantity E need not be the physical energy of the system; in these cases, this dimensionless quantity may be called quasienergy. Period of pulsation The period of pulsation is an increasing function of the amplitude ~\\\\gamma~. When ~\\\\gamma \\\\ll 1~, the period ~T(\\\\gamma)=2\\\\pi \\\\left( 1 + \\\\frac{\\\\gamma^2} {24} + O(\\\\gamma^4) \\\\right) ~ When ~\\\\gamma \\\\gg 1~, the period ~T(\\\\gamma)= 4\\\\gamma^{1/2} \\\\left(1+O(1/\\\\gamma)\\\\right) ~ In the whole range ~\\\\gamma > 0~, the period ~{T(\\\\gamma)}~ and frequency ~k(\\\\gamma)=\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{T(\\\\gamma)}~ can be approximated by : k_\\\\text{fit}(\\\\gamma)= \\\\frac{2\\\\pi} {T_\\\\text{fit}(\\\\gamma)}= : \\\\left( \\\\frac { 10630 \\\\+ 674\\\\gamma \\\\+ 695.2419\\\\gamma^2 \\\\+ 191.4489\\\\gamma^3 \\\\+ 16.86221\\\\gamma^4 \\\\+ 4.082607\\\\gamma^5 + \\\\gamma^6 } {10630 + 674\\\\gamma + 2467\\\\gamma^2 + 303.2428 \\\\gamma^3+164.6842\\\\gamma^4 + 36.6434\\\\gamma^5 + 3.9596\\\\gamma^6 + 0.8983\\\\gamma^7 +\\\\frac{16}{\\\\pi^4} \\\\gamma^8} \\\\right)^{1/4} to at least 8 significant figures. The relative error of this approximation does not exceed 22 \\\\times 10^{-9} . Decay of pulsation At small (but still positive) values of ~u~ and ~v~, the pulsation decays slowly, and this decay can be described analytically. In the first approximation, the parameters ~u~ and ~v~ give additive contributions to the decay; the decay rate, as well as the amplitude and phase of the nonlinear oscillation, can be approximated with elementary functions in a manner similar to the period above. In describing the behavior of the idealized Toda oscillator, the error of such approximations is smaller than the differences between the ideal and its experimental realization as a self- pulsing laser at the optical bench. However, a self-pulsing laser shows qualitatively very similar behavior. Continuous limit The Toda chain equations of motion, in the continuous limit in which the distance between neighbors goes to zero, become the Korteweg‚Äìde Vries equation (KdV) equation. Here the index labeling the particle in the chain becomes the new spatial coordinate. In contrast, the Toda field theory is achieved by introducing a new spatial coordinate which is independent of the chain index label. This is done in a relativistically invariant way, so that time and space are treated on equal grounds. This means that the Toda field theory is not a continuous limit of the Toda chain.

Immediately to the east lies Hayrick Butte, a prime example of a tuya; the two mountains' names were likely mistaken for each other, but stuck with them over time. The area has been subjected to a number of historic fires. Hoodoo is sometimes considered a subfeature of the Mount Washington shield volcano, and it forms part of the Sisters Reach, which extends from South Cinder Peak to Crane Prairie Reservoir, running for . This region has a high vent density, with many mafic (rich in magnesium and iron) volcanoes of Pleistocene to Holocene age, such as Hoodoo. While Hoodoo has an intact summit crater that was blocked from erosion by glaciers, it has an irregular topography, giving it an open appearance. A ski area, also named Hoodoo, is located on the northwest through northeast flanks of the cone, and includes five chairlifts. Other recreational activities popular in the area include snowshoeing and snowmobiling during the winter, and fishing, hiking, camping, mountain biking, windsurfing, and water skiing popular during the summer season.  Geography  Hoodoo Butte lies in Linn County, in the northern part of the U.S. state of Oregon. With an elevation of , it has a large, rounded shape, rising about above the surrounding platform. The volcano lies northwest of the city of Bend and about southeast of Portland. = Physical geography = In 1967, a stand replacement fire (a fire that kills most if not all of the living upper canopy layer in the forest and initiates succession or regrowth) burned through of the surrounding Santiam Pass area. It reached the vegetation on the eastern and southern flanks of Hoodoo Butte, leaving patches of trees compared to the denser forest on the northern slope. Forest fires tore through the region again during the summer of 2003. Soil on the mountain ranges from shallow to moderately deep with loam, and tends to be loose and cindery. = Ecology = Bird species near Hoodoo include woodpeckers and bald eagles. Deer and American black bears frequent the surrounding area.  Geology  Hoodoo Butte lies near the Santiam Pass area, in the eastern segment of the Cascade Range known as the High Cascades, which trends north‚Äìsouth. Constructed towards the end of the Pleistocene epoch, these mountains are underlain by more ancient volcanoes that subsided due to parallel north‚Äìsouth faulting in the surrounding region. In the region stretching south from Mount Jefferson to Santiam Pass, shield volcanoes dominate, forming a broad ridge with cinder cones. Eruptions at these vents have produced rocks with compositions ranging from basaltic andesite to andesite and basalt lavas. The majority of rock in the region consists of normally polarized material less than 730,000 years old. Hoodoo Butte is part of the Sisters Reach, which extends from South Cinder Peak to Crane Prairie Reservoir, running for . With at least 466 volcanoes active during the Quaternary, it has a high vent density, with many mafic (rich in magnesium and iron) volcanoes of Pleistocene to Holocene age. Hoodoo Butte is one of the larger mafic volcanoes, along with Three Fingered Jack, North Sister, and the vents of the Mount Bachelor chain. Sometimes considered a subfeature of the Mount Washington shield volcano, Hoodoo forms one of several glaciated remnants of Pleistocene volcanoes in the region, other nearby examples including Maxwell Butte and Cache Mountain. It is a cinder cone and possesses an intact summit crater, since the neighboring andesite lava dome of Hayrick Butte prevented Pleistocene glaciers from reaching Hoodoo's summit. The crater is open to the east as a result of its irregular topography, which led to uneven distribution of ejected material such that most of the volcanic rock that forms the edifice was deposited elsewhere. The cinder cone is surrounded by volcanic ash from the Sand Mountain Cones that was moved by water, and some of this ash forms a layer on the floor of the summit crater.  Human history  According to one local story, a cartographer accidentally switched the names for Hoodoo Butte and the nearby tuya Hayrick Butte. The word \\"hoodoo\\" refers to rock buttresses like those observed at the nearby Hayrick Butte, while \\"hayrick\\" is a synonym for haystack, a more fitting name for Hoodoo Butte, which has a profile that resembles a haystack shape. Whether or not this error actually occurred remains unclear, but the names remain to present day. The name Hoodoo Butte was confirmed by the on November 28, 1980. The top of Hoodoo Butte has electronic communication relay sites, which are owned by AT&T; and Bend Telecommunications.  Recreation  Hoodoo Butte, covered with snow The Hoodoo ski area, a popular winter sports destination, sits on Hoodoo Butte. It encompasses with 34 trail runs, five chairlifts, a snow tubing park, night skiing, lodges, rental and repair stores, and a day-care building. First built in 1938, the original ski area was supported by a group funded by Ed Thurston of Eugene. Following World War II, the ski area embarked on improvements, including lodging and chairlifts. The oldest ski area in the Central Cascades, the Hoodoo area offers terrains for all levels of skiing. It closes to off-road motorized vehicle use from November 1 through May 15. In addition to skiing, snowshoeing and snowmobiling are popular winter activities in the area, with fishing, hiking, camping, and mountain biking popular during the summer season. The Hoodoo Ski Bowl offers scenic views of the local region. Fishing is a popular recreational activity in the area, particularly for brook and cutthroat trout at Big Lake, south via the ski area's access road. Recreational boating, windsurfing, and water skiing are also common during the summer.  See also  * Santiam Highway * Hogg Rock  Notes  * [a] Other sources list the elevation at .

Heteronyms ;Xesko Francisco Santos's primary nom d'art or alter ego. ;Alan J. Banta The heteronym Alan J. Banta is described as a civil engineer, born in 1952 in Kakamas, a village located in the Northern Cape, South Africa but living and working in Angola. After independence, in 1975, remained in the country, for he considers his true home. This heteronym, emerges as a prolific writer of fantasy and science fiction, because of their South African origins and English education, is tending to express in a very classical way. According to Francisco Santos, Alan J. Banta, appears for the necessity of the author has in distancing his student's life from his fantasies. ;Elias Karipande By other side, the heteronym Elias Karipande, was born in 1958 in Karipande, a village of Alto Zambeze in Moxico, Angola. Countryman, having only attended primary school, enroll the People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola (FAPLA) in 1977 after the killing of their parents by militants of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).

It never proceeded past the flight testing phase but was the predecessor of the Hughes XF-11. The sole D-2 was completed in 1942‚Äì1943.Winchester 2005, p. 114. Design and development In 1937, Howard Hughes began the design of an advanced twin-engine, twin-boom interceptor in the hope of interesting the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) in its procurement. The design was somewhat similar to the Lockheed P-38 Lightning that won the 1939 USAAC design competition. Hughes later testified to the U.S. Senate that Lockheed had stolen his design, although this was refuted by many others. Rather than abandon the project, as he later recounted in the 1947 Senate investigation, he \\"decided to design and build from the ground up, and with my own money, an entirely new airplane which would be so sensational in its performance that the Army would have to accept it.\\" Barton 1982, pp. 14-15. Most of the airframe of the \\"DX-2\\" was made of Duramold plywood, a plastic-bonded plywood molded under heat and high pressure. This material was advantageous from an aerodynamic and a metals- shortage standpoint, but was difficult to work, and rejected as insufficiently robust by the USAAC. Initially, the aircraft was to have been equipped with a tail wheel but the landing gear was later changed to a tricycle configuration with the main undercarriage units retracting rearwards into the twin booms and the nosewheel retracting rearwards and rotating 90 degrees to lie flat in the small central fuselage. The powerplants were to have been a pair of experimental Wright R-2160 Tornado 42-cylinder, liquid-cooled radial engines. The D-2 was built in secret at the Hughes Culver City, California factory with longtime associate, Glenn Odekirk, providing engineering inputs.Parker, Dana T. Building Victory: Aircraft Manufacturing in the Los Angeles Area in World War II, p. 50, Cypress, CA, 2013. . The secrecy further alienated USAAC officers, especially when Hughes denied Materiel Command access to the plant. The USAAC had requested information about the project's progress, but did not enter into a formal contract until 1944. Final assembly and flight testing occurred at the Hughes Harper Dry Lake facility in the Mojave Desert. The finished D-2 looked like a scaled-up P-38 Lightning but, on paper, promised better performance; the USAAC repeatedly compared it to the Lockheed XP-58 Chain Lightning. Difficulties encountered in obtaining the Wright Tornado engines led to the substitution of proven Pratt & Whitney R-2800s. Numerous designations were given to the project, including D-2, DX-2, DX-2A, D-3, D-5, XA-37, and XP-73. The names reflected difficulties in development, shifting mission emphasis, and the USAAC's uncertainty over how to use the aircraft. In June 1942, a USAAF memorandum stated: \\"Hughes Model DX-2A. Has been submitted as a convoy protector, convoy destroyer, pursuit airplane, fighter, and light bombardment type. Its longest life has been as a convoy protector, but the latest specification which will be used in the negotiations calls it a fighter. If the present airplane is completed as a military weapon, it will have armament substantially as on the XP-58. Its sole claim to being a bomber is the fact that it is equipped with bomb bay doors. Since it is to be purchased in its commercial form ... it is considered advisable to call it the XP-73 for the sake of administering the contract.\\"Hansen 2012, p. 298. The XP-73 was thus a temporary designation applied to the D-2 after the Material Command at Wright Field obtained approval to purchase \\"one Hughes DX-2 airplane in present commercial form as a prototype ...\\"Case History of Hughes D-2, D-5, F-11 Project, Compiled by Historical Section Intelligence, Air Material Command, Wright Field, August 1946. Within three days, the D-2 had been redesignated as the XA-37 for purposes of administering a contract. However, Materiel Command engineers vehemently opposed the aircraft, partly because it was built of wood instead of aluminum, and in part because they believed Mr. Hughes had not the managerial and industrial capability to actually produce the aircraft. Neither of the above USAAF designations thus applied to any actual airplane; in the end, only two XF-11 prototypes and a mock-up were delivered. Because of Mr. Hughes's high political and public profile, the program was highly controversial. In July 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's requested information and progress from USAAF chief General Henry \\"Hap\\" Arnold about the aircraft. Again in August‚ÄìSeptember 1943, the president and White House staff discussed Hughes's progress with Arnold, who then gave the order to purchase 100 F-11 derivatives. Operational history =Testing= After the D-2 was readied for flight in 1942, Hughes himself took over the flight test program. However, after only a few brief hops, it was clear that high control forces were a problem. When full flight tests were finally conducted in spring 1943, modifications still had not been made to correct this problem. Hughes reluctantly concluded that the D-2 needed major modifications, including a complete redesign of the wings and a change in airfoil section. The wing center section, which was continuous through the fuselage nacelle, was to be revised to increase the size of the proposed bomb bay. Following these changes, the aircraft was to be assigned the company designation D-5. After only a few test flights, the sole aircraft was abandoned and further development of the subsequent F-11 proceeded at Culver City.Barton 1982, p. 15. =Aftermath= In August 1943, Colonel Elliott Roosevelt, the President's son and then commander of the Northwest African Photographic Reconnaissance Wing, led a distinguished team tasked with evaluation of several American reconnaissance aircraft projects. He was lavishly entertained by Howard Hughes and his staff, and on 20 August he submitted to Arnold a glowing recommendation of the D-2 with photographic reconnaissance modifications. Roosevelt stated that delivery of a small number of these planes would win the war within six months. It was this recommendation, shared by Elliott with his father the president, that caused General Arnold to verbally order the aircraft, overriding repeated objections from Materiel Command. On 11 October 1943, a letter of intent for 100 F-11s, costing $48,500,000 was signed. The D-2 prototype, which never flew well, was destroyed in an unexplained fire at Harper Dry Lake on 11 November 1944. The aircraft had become the center of a dispute between the USAAC and Hughes, who demanded that the military pay for its original development costs. The USAAF refused, and then insisted on inspecting the plane. However, after the fire, a 50-50 split of costs was agreed. In mid-1944, Hughes entered into the contract to develop the high-altitude, high-speed XF-11 derivative. The entire project was examined in great detail by the Senate War Investigating Committee in 1947. This led to the dramatic, highly publicized Hughes-Roosevelt hearings in August and November of that year. Variants ;D-2 :Prototype. One completed.

Keystone modules have a rectangular face of 14.5 mm wide by 16.0 mm high and are held in place with flexible tabs. This allows them to be snapped into a mounting plate with correspondingly-sized rectangular holes, called ports. All keystones, regardless of the type of jack they carry, are interchangeable and replaceable. This provides much flexibility in arranging and mounting many different types of electrical jacks in one plate or panel without requiring customized manufacturing. Some keystones use a pass-through type connector, where there is a jack on both the front face as well as the rear side. Others only have a jack on the front and employ a different mechanism for hard-wiring signal cables to the rear, such as a mini 110 block, an insulation- displacement connector, or a crimp or solder connection.

Located in the Willamette National Forest near Santiam Pass, it lies adjacent to the cinder cone Hoodoo Butte, which has a ski area. Hayrick Butte likely formed when lava erupted underneath an overlying glacier or ice sheet, producing the flat top with near-vertical walls along the ice-contact margin as the lava cooled and hardened. Hayrick Butte has a nearly flat plateau about across and steep walls rising about above its surroundings. A cartographer accidentally switched the names for nearby Hoodoo Butte and Hayrick Butte; the word \\"hoodoo\\" usually refers to rock piles and pinnacles like those observed at Hayrick Butte. Compared to Hoodoo, Hayrick is less popular for recreation, though it can be climbed, and there are hiking, snowshoeing, and snowmobile routes surrounding the butte. Its north-facing slope has subalpine forests with mountain hemlock and fir, which are common in the Cascades. Geography Hayrick Butte is located in Linn County in the U. S. state of Oregon. Close to Santiam Pass, it forms part of the United States Geological Survey topographic map for the Three Fingered Jack volcano. Hayrick Butte lies south of Three Fingered Jack near Hoodoo Butte, Sand Mountain Field, Potato Butte, and Black Butte, with Belknap Crater and Mount Washington further to the south. It is also within the McKenzie Ranger District of the Willamette National Forest. According to the Geographic Names Information System, Hayrick Butte has an elevation of ; in 1980, the Willamette National Forest Gazetteer listed its elevation as . The butte has a width of about . Hayrick Butte is located next to the Hoodoo ski area. In response to a new master plan at the Hoodoo Ski Bowl in 1995, the United States Forest Service released a draft environmental impact statement for the surroundings. The Forest Service argued that development at Hoodoo Butte and Hayrick Butte would require excavating and/or blasting of soil and rock on Hayrick Butte, which would potentially exacerbate erosion of local soil. The removal of this soil and rock would also substantially limit future revegetation, further reducing soil productivity in the area. The Forest Service statement also asserted that development of new trails would not lead to significant \\"scenic resource effects,\\" and that any \\"landform modification\\" from a proposed snow play area would only have moderate and short-term effects. Ecology The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife determined in the early 1990s that there was potential for peregrine falcon nests at Hayrick Butte, though it was considered low-quality habitat because of its lack of suitable ledges and high amounts of human disturbance. According to a 2003 paper, Hayrick Butte has a rich forest on its steep, north-facing slope with mountain hemlock and mature fir trees at an elevation of . Oroboreal subalpine forests like these usually occur above elevations of in the Cascades, in areas with cool, wet climates. Mean precipitation for these zones ranges from , with cool summers and cold, snowy winters. Dense forests are less common at higher elevations, switching to patchy forest stands separated from each other by shrubs or meadows. Geology North Sister (of the Three Sisters volcano complex) and Mount Washington mark isolated volcanic centers among the highly mafic (rich in magnesium and iron) platform of the central High Cascade arc. About 4.5 million years ago, eruption of mafic lava filled a subsiding Pliocene depression, creating the modern, mafic High Cascades. Compared to the eruptive products at and near North Sister, lava deposits at Mount Washington have a greater abundance of incompatible elements (elements unsuitable in size and/or charge to the cation sites of the minerals of which it is included.) The nearby lava dome and tuya (subglacial volcano) Hogg Rock shows more similarity to the basaltic andesite deposits at North Sister, which are poorly enriched in incompatible elements. The part of the High Cascades that extends south from Mount Jefferson to Santiam Pass includes shield volcanoes, lava domes, and cinder cones. The high elevation of Matuyama-aged rocks east of Santiam Pass, coupled with exposure of Brunhes-aged rocks to the west, imply the presence of a northward-trending normal fault. Hayrick Butte is of late Pleistocene age. Like Hogg Rock, Hayrick Butte is an andesite lava dome with a flat top, suggesting that it is also a tuya, or a subglacial volcano. Both volcanic features have been eroded by glaciation, leaving glassy margins and jointing. Both Hayrick Butte and Hogg Rock produced porphyritic andesite lava with plagioclase and orthopyroxene and trace levels of phenocrysts with olivine. Hayrick Butte also served as a barrier for Hoodoo Butte during the Pleistocene glaciation, blocking the advancement of glacial ice from eroding Hoodoo's summit crater. Most lava domes in the Cascades occur in clusters or surrounding just a few major volcanic centers. There are roughly 190 known domes in the state of Oregon, with 40 located near Mount Jefferson, 22 near the Tumalo volcanic highland, 28 near the Three Sisters, and close to 60 surrounding Mount Mazama. Hayrick Butte, however, is more isolated from other volcanoes. Hayrick Butte, along with Benchmark Butte, formed more than from any major stratovolcano. Hildreth (2007) likewise writes that Hayrick is \\"clearly separated from major clusters or evolved centers.\\" Hayrick Butte has a normal magnetic polarity. Like Hogg Rock and other andesite lava domes in the area, it has lower incompatible element abundances than surrounding andesitic rock deposits. A 1992 element abundance analysis of Hayrick Butte andesite samples from the margin of the volcano shows a silicon dioxide (silica) level of 60.1 percent, aluminum oxide level of 18.4 percent, calcium oxide level of 6.24 percent, iron(II) oxide level of 5.55 percent, and sodium oxide level of 4.42 percent. Magnesium oxide made up 3.3 percent of the samples, with potassium oxide levels at 1.08 percent and manganese(II) oxide, phosphorus pentoxide, and titanium dioxide all below 1 percent. Additional studies from 1980 and 1983 exhibit similar levels of silica in samples from Hogg Rock and Hayrick Butte at about 59 to 60 percent. Human history According to cartographer Stuart Allen, an early cartographer accidentally switched the names for nearby Hoodoo Butte and Hayrick Butte. The word \\"hoodoo\\" refers to rock piles and pinnacles like those observed at Hayrick Butte, while \\"hayrick\\" is a synonym for haystack, a more fitting name for Hoodoo Butte, which has a profile that resembles a haystack shape. Whether or not this error actually occurred remains unclear, but the names remain to present day. Recreation The Obsidian Climb School and Eugene Mountain Rescue offer climbing classes and field sessions at Hayrick Butte. A backcountry, snowshoeing trail runs for from the Hoodoo ski area, rising about in elevation over its course. The route travels between Hayrick and Hoodoo Butte, offering views of Mount Washington. There is an avalanche hazard near Hayrick's base. An old roadbed next to the trail travels up Hoodoo Butte to the Hoodoo Butte Plateau and the butte's summit, where a historic fire cleared many trees. There are snowmobile routes down the old Santiam Pass Wagon Road to the south and Forest Road 2690 to the east, as well as a geocache at Hayrick's summit. Markian Hawryluk of The Bulletin in Bend described Hayrick as \\"antisocial\\" compared to the \\"family- friendly ski area\\" of Hoodoo Butte, citing its tall, nearly vertical walls. The tuya is also surrounded by cliffs. William Sullivan of The Register-Guard wrote that Hayrick offered \\"breathtaking views\\" of Mount Jefferson, Big Lake, Hoodoo Butte, Mount Washington, and Black Butte. Hayrick Butte is also visible from the Patjens Lake Loop trail near Santiam Pass.

It extended from Marblehead through Lakeside to a connection with the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway (later the New York Central Railroad) at Danbury (an unincorporated hamlet bordering Sandusky Bay). A common carrier, it carried both freight and passengers. It was abandoned as a common carrier railroad July 31, 1964, operated for the last time as a private industrial railroad in Summer 1978, and its tracks were removed in Fall 1997. The L&M; was primarily a limestone hauler for the stone quarries at Marblehead. These firms sent out thousands of carloads per year of shell or \\"flux\\" stone to be consumed by blast furnaces across the midwestern United States in the process of making steel. When the original promoters were unable to build enough traffic to keep the line financially afloat, the railroad was purchased by the Cleveland, Ohio-based Kelley Island Lime & Transport Company (KIL&T;) January 1, 1891, as its first step in buying out all of the quarries of Marblehead. After integrating these quarries into one large operation, KIL&T; also used the L&M; to move stone between various lime kilns and processing facilities. The line remained under control of KIL&T; and its successors for its entire existence. Origin  The Lakeside and Marblehead Railroad was the successor of the Cleveland, Toledo and Lakeside Railway, which was incorporated April 18, 1885, to build a steam railroad from the stone quarries at Marblehead to the tracks of the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern at Danbury. The CT&L; was promoted locally by Edgar H. Brennan, a civil engineer, who was unable to find enough financial capital to begin construction. The following year, Brennan made contact with Hiram A. Blood and a syndicate of other railroad promoters based in Massachusetts, who bought out the interests of the CT&L;, incorporated the L&M;, and began construction on or about October 1, 1886. The line was finished by the end of December. The first revenue freight ran on the line January 3, 1887, and passenger service opened January 17, 1887.  Freight and passenger service  The L&M; at its opening used an American-type steam locomotive with a 4-4-0 wheel arrangement. It soon traded this machine to the Cleveland & Canton Railroad in exchange for a steam switch locomotive with a 0-6-0 wheel arrangement. The L&M; owned an assortment of only 0-6-0 models over the years until the last steam locomotive left its property on January 31, 1953. The line's first two diesel-electric locomotives were General Electric 70-ton models. These were succeeded by one General Motors SW7 and two General Motors SW8 locomotives. Freight volume peaked in 1953, when the line hauled 3,134,403 tons of freight in 46,809 cars, almost all of which was outbound limestone. L&M; passengers were carried at first with steam trains, then, beginning in 1910, with two gasoline rail motor cars. The first motor car was a four- wheeled Fairbanks-Morse Model 24 carrying 35 passengers. The second, which operated from 1916 to 1930, was a McKeen car carrying 48 passengers. Passenger ridership peaked around 1904 at roughly 19,000 passengers per year.  Cooperation with an interurban  The Toledo, Port Clinton and Lakeside Railway (TPC&L;), a standard gauge electric interurban railroad, was built to Marblehead in 1905 and also began to serve Lakeside and Marblehead, the only two major settlements on the L&M;, with passenger and freight service. Although steam railroads and interurbans were usually very fierce rivals, the L&M; welcomed the new line with open arms because it provided a new outlet for freight traffic aside from its connection with the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway. The two made a connection at a point named Violet, near Church Road, in rural Danbury Township, until the TPC&L;'s track was abandoned in 1940. In 1907, the L&M; leased to the TPC&L; a short section track extending from Marblehead to Ohlemacher's Dock, which faced north into Lake Erie. The TPC&L; electrified the track and sent its cars over it to meet ferry boats that took passengers from Marblehead to Sandusky. This arrangement ultimately proved unfavorable, so in 1911, the L&M; built and leased to the TPC&L; a new track extension extending south from Marblehead to a dock facing south into Sandusky Bay at Bay Point, where ferry boats took passengers to Cedar Point and Sandusky over a shorter and much more direct route. This arrangement remained in place until June 30, 1926.  Later years  In 1955, the Kelley Island Lime & Transport Company sold the L&M; and the Marblehead stone quarries to Chemstone Corporation, a subsidiary of Minerals Corporation of America. Chemstone continued to operate the railroad as a common carrier, but freight volume quickly dropped as customers moved elsewhere and modernization of the quarry infrastructure required less use of the railroad. In 1962, Chemstone sold the quarry and railroad to the Youngstown, Ohio-based Standard Slag Company. Standard Slag quickly completed modernization of the quarries to mine the lower layers of dolomitic limestone then available. Stone was then moved around the quarry on conveyor belts and all outbound stone was shipped via lake freighter, making the railroad largely obsolete. Only a handful of non-quarry customers remained; not enough to keep the L&M; financially afloat. The Lakeside and Marblehead Railroad was abandoned July 31, 1964, after hauling 85,280,000 tons of freight and almost 570,000 revenue passengers. Its property and infrastructure were transferred to Standard Slag, which kept it largely intact, operating it occasionally over the years for customers who preferred to receive stone by rail rather than water. The last train operated in November 1978, with Standard Slag locomotive number 51 (ex-L&M; 14). Standard Slag sold the quarry and railroad to Lafarge Corporation in 1989. Lafarge scrapped the final locomotive in June 1995, and most of the line beginning in September 1997.  Present day  The railroad's depot at Lakeside, Ohio, was restored in 2003 and is now used as a multi- purpose meeting facility. The railroad's Danbury depot has been moved to Fremont, Ohio, for use as a business. The line's engine houses and station in Marblehead are gone. A portion of the line's right-of-way in Lakeside is now a walking path. None of the line's rolling stock survives. A few sections of original track remain within Lafarge's quarry property.  Archiving and preservation  In 1992 two teenagers from Marblehead, Ohio, David Koran and Michael Crawford, began a research project of archiving, photographing, and researching the abandoned properties of the Lakeside and Marblehead Railroad and the local stone quarries. The research contributed to the formation of The Marblehead Quarry and Railroad Preservation Group in 1994, a non profit organization that was later dissolved in 2005. The results of the preservation work was published on a series of websites including now defunct The Marblehead Quarry History Site in 2004. Material was also used to research a series of local books on the Lakeside and Marblehead Railroad and its quarries. Much of the remaining archives of the Group are pending donation to local museums. A small collection of materials, primarily consisting of correspondence to and from the company, is held at the Center for Archival Collections at Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, Ohio under the catalog number MS-177.

He competed in the AMA Motocross Championships from 1972 to 1980. Weinert won 22 AMA Nationals and three AMA national championships during his racing career. In 1973, Weinert became the first American to defeat international-level riders in the Trans-AMA motocross series. That victory marked a turning point that brought American motocross up to par with the then dominant European riders. TOC Motocross career Born in Middletown, New York, Weinert was the son of a motorcycle dealer and began riding at an early age. Early in his career, he split his time between motocross and dirt track oval racing however, an injury while racing on the high speed dirt track ovals convinced him to concentrate on the burgeoning sport of motocross. Weinert began racing professionally in 1970 riding a CZ. In 1972 he finished runner up to Gary Jones in the inaugural AMA 250cc motocross national championship. At the end of the 1972 season, Weinert along with Jones, Brad Lackey and Jim Pomeroy were selected by the AMA to be the first American team to represent the United States at the Motocross des Nations where the team posted a seventh place result. Weinert earned a place on the Kawasaki factory racing team and went on to win the 1974 AMA 500cc national championship. Weinert along with Brad Lackey, Jim Pomeroy and Tony DiStefano represented the United States at the 1974 Motocross des Nations event where they finished in an impressive second-place, marking the best-ever result at the time for an American team at the event. He successfully defended his 500cc national championship title in 1975. He also won the 1976 AMA 250cc Supercross championship. In the 1979 Supercross championship, Weinert won the Oakland Coliseum round by using a scoop paddle rear tire to win both his heat race and the main event. Within a few weeks, the AMA had banned the use of paddle tires. His last national victory came at the 1979 Daytona Supercross race. Nagging injuries as well as a new generation of younger competitors such as Bob Hannah and Kent Howerton led Weinert to retire in 1980. Weinert continues his involvement in the sport competing in vintage motocross events and operating a motocross training facility in Maysville, North Carolina. In 1999, he was inducted into the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame.

Tin City, a collection of squatters shacks is built on Stockton Beach near the border between Bobs Farm and Salt Ash. Aquaculture industry Bobs Farm is the centre of a thriving, environmentally friendly, aquaculture industry that exports technology. In 2007 pioneering aquaculture technology, based around a recirculating system that is the only one in the world to provide consistent reproduction, was sold for the creation of six farms in the United States. , discussions were in progress with companies in Africa, the Middle East, Europe and Asia. An education and tourism centre was constructed at the site of Tailor Made Fish Farms in 2007.Port Stephens Examiner, 9 August 2007 In addition to it being environmentally friendly and providing consistent results, the technology developed at Bobs Farm is expected to reduce capitalisation costs.

It most likely covered the floor of the great audience hall of Taq Kasra, an iwan in the Sasanian capital of Ctesiphon. The carpet was 27m long and 27m wide. Woven of silk, gold, silver, and rare stones, the carpet depicted a splendid garden akin to paradise. When Ctesiphon fell to the Arabs in 637, the carpet was too heavy for the Iranians to carry away, and which resulted in the carpet being seized by the Arabs. Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas, who led the Arab troops during the capture of Ctesiphon, sent the carpet to the Rashidun caliph Umar, who was in Medina. There the carpet was cut into small fragments and divided among the Arabs. One of the Arabs who received a piece of the carpet was Ali who, although he did not receive the best piece, managed to sell it for 30,000 dirhams.

Founded in 1884, the seminary has 114 seminarians and approximately 60 lay students, mostly from dioceses in New England. The current interim rector is Fr. Stephen E. Salocks, professor of Sacred Scripture.  History  In 1864, wealthy Boston merchant James Stanworth acquired a farm on a hill in Brighton known as the Hildreth estate. Stanworth suffered losses in the Panic of 1873 and his heirs found he owed substantial debts. Archbishop John Joseph Williams purchased the Hildreth estate and construction of the Boston Ecclesiastical Seminary began in 1881 and was completed in 1884. In 1883, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts granted a Charter to the Seminary to grant degrees in philosophy and divinity.\\"History\\", SJS The Archbishop entrusted the seminary to his former teachers, the Sulpicians.Fenlon, John Francis. \\"Sulpicians in the United States.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 14. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 22 August 2019 Students began classes on September 22, 1884. The First rector was John Baptist Hogan. The Seminary was incorporated under the laws of Massachusetts in 1892. In 1911, the Sulpicians withdrew from the seminary at the request of Archbishop William Henry O'Connell, who preferred a diocesan faculty more familiar with local conditions. Grounds surrounding seminary Saint John's Seminary adopted its present name in 1941. =Merger with Cardinal O'Connell Seminary= Cardinal O'Connell Seminary, the archdiocesan minor seminary for high school students in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, was merged with Saint John's Seminary in 1968. In 1970 its programs were relocated to a Foster Street site in Saint Clement's Hall. =Crisis and recovery after 2000 child sexual abuse scandal= In the wake of the Catholic Archdiocese of Boston sex abuse scandal enrollment declined from a peak of 86 students in the academic year 2001‚Äì02 to 34 for 2005-06. Two years later, the seminary recovered to a student population of 63. During the 2000s, nearly all the Seminary's land and buildings were sold to Boston College (BC), the neighboring Jesuit-run college. In 2001, Boston College leased St. Clement's Hall, formerly the site of the Seminary's undergraduate division, and it bought the property in June 2004. In May 2007, the Archdiocese sold the Seminary's open land, its library building and several other structures. Rector John Farren, OP resigned and protested the 2007 sale in a letter to Cardinal O'Malley. After the land sales, the campus of the Seminary consists only of Saint John's Hall. =Sexual misconduct scandal and resignations= In August 2018, the rector of Saint John's was placed on administrative leave after two former seminarians claimed on social media that sexual misconduct frequently occurred at the school. The new allegations forced a new investigation by Archdiocese of Boston against Saint John's. On November 22, 2019, the Archdiocese of Boston and former U.S. Attorney Donald Stern concluded that there was some accuracy to the 2018 allegations, such as the expulsion of two students in 2014 for inappropriate sexual conduct, an incident from 2015 where six students engaged in sexting, and inappropriate sexual behavior at a 2015 bachelor party which was held on campus. Despite also criticizing Saint John's for having poor leadership, poor financial oversight, and inadequate human formation of seminarians, the joint investigation also concluded that the sexual misconduct which occurred at the seminary was not unlawful either. In December 2019, Stephen Shylocks, who was named interim rector when the investigation started, replaced Msgr. James Moroney as the permanent director of Saint John's Seminary. In addition to promoting Shalocks, Boston Archbishop Cardinal Sean Patrick O'Malley also named Fr. Thomas MacDonald vice rector. =Enrollment statistics= (by academic year) * 2001‚Äì2002: 86 * 2005‚Äì2006: 34 * 2007‚Äì2008: 63 * 2009‚Äì2010: 91 (81 diocesan seminarians and 10 religious) * 2015‚Äì2016: 114 (78 diocesan seminarians and 36 religious) * 2016-2017: 139 (100 diocesan seminarians and 39 religious) Participating dioceses Most students are from dioceses in New England: in Massachusetts, from the Archdiocese of Boston and the Dioceses of Fall River, Springfield, and Worcester; in Connecticut, from the Archdiocese of Hartford; and also from the dioceses of Burlington, Vermont, Manchester, New Hampshire, and Providence, Rhode Island. In the academic year of 2014-2015, St. John's began receiving seminarians from the Diocese of Rochester, New York. That same year, the Diocese of Portland, which encompasses all of Maine, resumed sending seminarians. St. John's also serves as the seminary for a few men from dioceses outside the U.S. Statue of St. Patrick, patron of the Archdiocese of Boston College-level seminary candidates for the Archdiocese of Boston reside at Our Lady of Providence Seminary College in Providence, Rhode Island and various other institutions. Academics St. John's Seminary exterior =Seminary programs= As a major seminary, an institution providing formation for the Catholic priesthood, Saint John's offers a four-year program leading to the Master of Divinity degree. There is also a program leading to the Master of Arts in Theology. In addition, \\"St. John's Seminary offers a two-year program of initial formation for those candidates who are college graduates and have no prior experience of formal preparation for the sacrament of Holy Orders.\\" Those who complete the Pre-Theology Program may qualify to receive a Bachelor of Philosophy (B.Phil.). =Programs for lay students= The Seminary's Theological Institute for the New Evangelization offers programs for lay people wishing to work in Roman Catholic ministry, leading to the degrees Master of Theological Studies for the New Evangelization, and Master of Arts in Ministry (MAM). These programs are based at a separate campus in accordance with norms of the Holy See.On Certain Questions Regarding the Collaboration of the Non-Ordained Faithful in the Sacred Ministry of Priest, 1997, art. 13. The MAM division of TINE also offers non-credit catechist training programs in evangelization and apologetics. =Accreditation= The Seminary is accredited by the Association of Theological Schools and by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges.

Twice a year St. John's Seminary competes in softball games against Pope St. John XXIII National Seminary (Weston, MA) and Our Lady of Providence College Seminary (Providence, RI). With access to the Flynn Recreation Complex at Boston College, seminarians contend in intramural basketball and soccer leagues against Boston College students. Daily life The daily schedule includes classes and services in chapel. Seminarians have off-campus pastoral assignments at least once per week. Most seminarians also have a \\"house job\\", such as sacristan or bookstore manager. Each seminarian meets with his spiritual director twice monthly.

A study was completed in 2005 by Wikstrom Economic & Planning Consultants, Inc., to determine if moving the prison would be feasible. The test of feasibility was whether or not the value of the real estate of the current location could support the cost of relocation. It was determined that the cost of relocating the prison far exceeded the value that could be realized from the sale of the Draper prison site. However, on August 19, 2015, a special session of the state legislature voted to move the prison to the west side of Salt Lake City.

The Draper site is located near Point of the Mountain along the Traverse Ridge and consists of several units named after surrounding mountains and mountain ranges. These units range from minimum security to supermax. The Uintas house maximum security units for male inmates and include a supermax facility and execution chamber.

It was first published in the November 1956 issue of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction under the title \\"The Brazen Locked Room\\", and reprinted under Asimov's original title in the 1957 collection Earth is Room Enough. The title refers to what Asimov called \\"the three well-worn gimmicks of pact with the devil, locked room mystery, and time travel\\".Isaac Asimov,In Joy Still Felt, 4:28.  Plot summary  Isidore Wellby has just left the army and, abandoned by his girlfriend, feels lost and let down. In desperation, he signs away his soul in blood to a demon named Shapur. On the proviso that eventually he will be forced to enter hell, either as an ordinary damned soul or as a member of the cadre, he is allotted a number of demonic powers, the nature of which are not initially explained to him. Ten years later, he has become a successful businessman and has married his erstwhile girlfriend. Shapur reappears to demand his price. If Wellby can perform a simple task using his demonic powers, Wellby will be accepted as a member of the elite of hell. Otherwise, he will be just an ordinary damned soul. Wellby is confined to an apparently sealed bronze room and challenged to escape from it. Eventually, with little time left, he realizes that he has the power to move through time - the fourth dimension - and travels backward, thus escaping from the room. In the story's climax, it is revealed that he has moved back to the time before he had signed away his soul and so he is able to turn down Shapur's persuasive offer, much to the demon's fury. However, he still had his ten successful years, since deals with Hell can give a person nothing he could not have obtained on his own. And since the demon no longer owns his soul, he has many more years left.

Although the designs were never finished and no models ever went into production, the project spawned a number of organizational techniques and architectural innovations that have since become incorporated into nearly all high- performance computers in existence today. Many of the ideas resulting from the project directly influenced the development of the IBM RS/6000 and, more recently, have contributed to the Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing (EPIC) computing paradigm used by Intel and HP in high-performance processors. History The ACS project began in 1961 as Project Y with a goal of ‚Äúbuilding a machine that was one hundred times faster than Stretch‚Äù. Initial work began at the IBM Watson Research Center. A number of significant computer pioneers contributed to the project, including John Cocke, Herb Schorr, Frances Allen, Gene Amdahl, and Lynn Conway. A decision by IBM in May 1968 to modify the project to support S/360 compatibility resulted in the name change from ACS-1 to ACS-360 for the computer being designed. At its peak, the ACS-360 project involved over 200 engineers and staff. The ACS-360 project was canceled in May 1969; however, many of the innovations resulting from the project would eventually find direct realization in the IBM RS/6000 series of machines (later known as the IBM System p line of workstations and servers), apart from influencing the design of other machines and architectures. Influence Although neither the ACS-1 nor the ACS-360 was ever manufactured, the IBM Advanced Computing Systems group responsible for their design developed architectural innovations and pioneered a number of RISC CPU design techniques that would become fundamental to the design of modern computer architectures and systems: * Aggressive reduction in the number of logic gate levels for pipeline stages to reduce the cycle time * Tight integration between processor and memory * Cache memory with streamlined I/O to/from cache * Compiler optimization techniques * Virtual-memory operating systems * Multiple instruction decode and issue (a first) * Use of a branch target buffer (a first) * Multithreading implemented in hardware (a first for IBM) * Dynamic instruction scheduling/out-of-order execution * Hardware register renaming * Instruction predication * Level-sensitive scan design (used by IBM) * Fixed-head hard disks * Air-cooled high-speed LSI circuits * Advanced simulation tools used in the design process Notes Further reading * External links * IBM Advanced Computing Systems (ACS) -- 1961-1969 -- Documentation project for the IBM ACS-1 supercomputer maintained by Mark Smotherman Advanced Computing Systems project Advanced Computing Systems project ","title":"IBM Advanced Computer Systems project"},{"id":"9749066","text":"Williamtown is a rural suburb of the Port Stephens local government area in the Hunter Region of New South Wales, Australia.

The Epitaphios (Greek: ·ºòœÄŒπœÑŒ¨œÜŒπŒøœÇ, epit√°phios, or ·ºòœÄŒπœÑŒ¨œÜŒπŒøŒΩ, epit√°phion; Slavonic: –ü–ª–∞—â–∞–Ω–∏—Ü–∞, plashchanitsa; Arabic: ŸÜÿπÿ¥, naash) is a Christian religious icon, typically consisting of a large, embroidered and often richly adorned cloth, bearing an image of the dead body of Christ, often accompanied by his mother and other figures, following the Gospel account. It is used during the liturgical services of Good Friday and Holy Saturday in the Eastern Orthodox Churches, as well as those Eastern Catholic Churches, which follow the Byzantine Rite. It also exists in painted or mosaic form, on wall or panel. The Epitaphios is also a common short form of the Epit√°phios Thrƒìnos, the \\"Lamentation upon the Grave\\" in Greek, which is the main part of the service of the Matins of Holy Saturday, served in Good Friday evening. Armenian Orthodox have also the tradition of the epitaphios. Their celebration on this day is called T'aghman Kark (Rite of the Burial). Etymology The word Epit√°phios is composite, from the Greek ·ºêœÄŒØ, ep√≠, \\"on\\" or \\"upon\\", and œÑŒ¨œÜŒøœÇ, t√°phos, \\"grave\\" or \\"tomb\\". In Greek the word has, inter alia, the meaning of both the English epitaph and the liturgical one presented here, the latter having been acquired during the Christian period.. Iconography The icon depicts Christ after he has been removed from the cross, lying supine, as his body is being prepared for burial. The scene is taken from the Gospel of St. John (). Shown around him, and mourning his death, may be his mother (the Theotokos or Blessed Virgin Mary); John the beloved disciple; Joseph of Arimathea; and Mary Magdalene, as well as angels. Nicodemus and others may also be depicted. Often the Four Evangelists will be shown in the corners. Sometimes, the body of Christ appears alone, except for angels, as if lying in state. The oldest surviving embroidered icon, of about 1200 (Venice) is in this form. The equivalent subjects in the West are called the \\"Anointing of Christ's body\\", or Lamentation of Christ (with a group present), or the Piet√†, with just Christ held by Mary. Epitaphios painted by Viktor Vasnetsov, 1896 (Russian Museum, St. Petersburg). The image may be embroidered or painted on fabric or some other substrate, which is then mounted in a wide cloth border (burgundy is the most common colour) often edged in gold fringe. Some cloths are missing the corners of the border, to allow them to sit neatly on the holy table. Usually, the troparion of the day is embroidered in gold letters around the edges of the icon: :The Noble Joseph, taking down Thy most pure Body from the Tree, did wrap it in clean linen with sweet spices, and he laid it in a new tomb. In the Late Byzantine period, the icon depicting the burial of Jesus was commonly painted below a Christ Pantocrator in the apse of the prothesis (the chapel where the Liturgy of Preparation was performed) in Orthodox churches, illustrating a liturgical hymn which celebrated Christ \\"On the throne above and in the tomb below\\".G Schiller, Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. II,1972 (English trans. from German), Lund Humphries, London, p.199, The icon, in particular a panel mosaic version taken to Rome, probably in the 12th century, developed in the West into the subject Man of Sorrows, which was enormously popular in the Late Middle Ages, though that image shows a living Christ, normally with eyes open. Liturgical use Holy Table at a church in Chicago. The Epitaphios is used on the last two days of Holy Week in the Byzantine rite, as part of the ceremonies marking the death and resurrection of Christ. It is then placed on the Holy Table (altar table), where it remains throughout the Paschal season. =Vespers on Great Friday= The Deposition from the Cross. Prior to the Apokathelosis, Vespers on the afternoon of Great Friday, the priest and deacon will place the Epitaphios on the Holy Table. The priest may also anoint the Epitaphios with perfumed oil. A chalice veil and the Gospel Book is placed on top of the Epitaphios. This may be either the large Gospel Book that otherwise lies on the Holy table, or it may be a small one. During the reading of the Gospel lesson (a concatenation compiled from selections of all four Gospels) which recounts the death and burial of Christ, an icon depicting the soma (corpus) of Christ is taken down from a cross which has been set up in the middle of the church. The soma is wrapped in a white cloth and taken into the sanctuary. Epitaphios adorned for veneration. Near the end of the service, the priest and deacon, accompanied by acolytes with candles and incense, bring the Epitaphios in procession from the Holy Table into the center of the church and place it on a table which is often richly decorated for that purpose. The Gospel Book is laid on top of the epitaphios. In some Greek churches, an elaborately carved canopy, called a kouvouklion, stands over the Epitaphios. This bier or catafalque represents the Tomb of Christ, and is made of wood, usually elaborately carved. On Good Friday morning, the bier is decorated with spring flowers, mostly white, red, and purple, until it is covered by the flowers in its entirety. The Tomb is often sprinkled with flower petals and rosewater, decorated with candles, and ceremonially censed as a mark of respect. The bells of the church are tolled, and in traditionally Orthodox countries, flags are lowered to half-mast. Then the priest and faithful venerate the Epitaphios as the choir chants hymns. In Slavic churches, the service of Compline will be served next, during which a special Canon will be chanted which recalls the lamentations of the Theotokos. The faithful continue to visit the tomb and venerate the Epitaphios throughout the afternoon and evening, until Matins--which is usually served in the evening during Holy Week, so that the largest number of people can attend. The form which the veneration of the epitaphios takes will vary between ethnic traditions. Some will make three prostrations, then kiss the image of Christ on the Epitaphios and the Gospel Book, and then make three more prostrations. Sometimes, the faithful will crawl under the table on which the Epitaphios has been placed, as though entering into death with Christ. Others may simply light a candle and/or say a short prayer with bowed head. In Ukrainian Catholic churches and others of the Ruthenian tradition, the laity will often sing vernacular hymns at this point. One such hymn is stradal'na maty (—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–¥–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞ –º–∞—Ç–∏), the contents of which approximate the Stabat mater, and may be heard here: The priest may hear confessions at the Epitaphios, and he may anoint people who were not able to be present for the Unction service earlier in the week. The Acolouthia of the Holy and Great Saturday and hence the Epitaphios procession (see below), started according to ancient customs during the Saturday Matins (Orthros), but nowadays, it frequently begins a bit earlier, at the night of Holy and Great Friday. =Matins on Great Saturday= Beginning of the epitaphios procession at Great Saturday Matins The Epitaphios is placed on a decorated bier, and carried in procession (Church of the Theotokos Odigitria in Pelekas, Corfu, Greece). St. George Greek Orthodox Church, Adelaide). The Burial of Christ. During Matins, Lamentations (Greek: ·ºòœÄŒπœÑŒ¨œÜŒπŒøœÇ ŒòœÅ·øÜŒΩŒøœÇ, Epitaphios Thrƒìnos, \\"Epitaphic Lamentation\\"; or ·ºòŒ≥Œ∫œéŒºŒπŒ±, Enk≈çmia, \\"praises\\") are sung before the Epitaphios as at the tomb of Christ, while all hold lighted candles. The verses of these Lamentations are interspersed between the verses of Psalm 118 (the chanting of this psalm forms a major part of the Orthodox funeral service as well as being a usual part of Saturday Matins). The Lamentations are divided into three sections called st√°ses, each commonly known by its first phrase; in Greek these are: *First stasis: , He zoe en taphoi, \\"Life in (the) tomb\\" or \\"Life in (the) grave\\". *Second stasis: , Axion esti, \\"Worthy, it is\\" or \\"It is Truly Meet\\". *Third stasis: , Hai geneai pasai, \\"All the generations\\" or \\"Every generation\\".Side by side Greek text, approximate modern Greek pronunciation/transliteration and (free) English translation of the Encomia: At the beginning of each st√°sis, the priest or deacon will perform a censing. In the Greek use, at the third and final st√°sis, the priest will sprinkle rosewater on the Epitaphios and the congregation, symbolising the anointing of Christ's body with spices. Near the end of Matins, during the Great Doxology, a solemn procession with the Epitaphios is held, with bells ringing the funeral toll, commemorating the burial procession of Christ. In Slavic churches, the Epitaphios alone is carried in procession with candles and incense. It may be carried by hand or raised up on poles like a canopy. Many Greek churches, however, will carry the entire bier, with its carved canopy attached. In societies where Byzantine Christianity is traditional, the processions may take extremely long routes through the streets, with processions from different parishes joining together in a central location. Where this is not possible, the procession goes three times around the outside of the church building. The procession is accompanied by the singing of the Trisagion, typically in a melodic form used at funerals. Those unable to attend the church service will often come out to balconies and sidewalks where the procession passes, holding lit candles and sometimes hand- held censers. In many Greek villages, the Epitaphios is also paraded in the cemetery, among the graves, as a covenant of eternal life to those who have died. In many towns where more than one parishes exist, the processions often converge to a single spot, e.g. a square, where they temporarily stop and a common Tris√°gion is sung before they resume their routes. This is notably done on the island of Hydra, where the Epitaphios from the Kam√≠ni parish is brought into the sea until the bier bearers are waist-high in the water, as a special blessing for those who have perished at sea. In larger towns the procession is led by a local marching band playing funeral marches; in some cities the Epitaphios is escorted by military detachments, their arms in the mourning (muzzle towards the ground) position. At the end of the procession, the Epitaphios is brought back to the church. Sometimes, after the clergy carry the Epitaphios in, they will stop just inside the entrance to the church, and hold the Epitaphios above the door, so that all who enter the church will pass under it (symbolically entering into the grave with Christ) and then kiss the Gospel Book. In Greek churches, the Epitaphios is then brought directly to the sanctuary, where it remains on the Holy Table until Ascension Thursday. In Slavic churches, it is brought back to the catafalque in the middle of the church (and may be honoured further with more petals, rosewater and incense), where it remains until the Midnight Office at the Paschal Vigil on Great Saturday night. Where the Epitaphios remains in the centre of the church, the faithful will continue to venerate it throughout Great Saturday. =Liturgy on Holy Saturday= Gold-thread embroidered and inscribed epitaphios, 17th century, Benaki Museum The Little Hours on Holy Saturday are read near the Epitaphios, rather than the kliros; and certain portions of the Divine Liturgy that would normally be performed at the ambo in front of the Holy Doors (Ektenias, reading the Gospel, the Great Entrance, etc.) are instead performed in front of the Epitaphios. Only the Communion of the Faithful and the dismissal take place at the ambo. In some places, the entire Liturgy takes place around the Epitaphios, with it serving as the Holy Table (altar), and the clergy standing around it instead of behind the iconostasis. =Midnight Office of Pascha= During the Midnight Office, after the Usual Beginning and Psalm 50, the Canon of Great Saturday, repeated from the preceding Matins as a reflection upon the meaning of Christ‚Äôs death and his Harrowing of Hell. During the last Ode of the Canon, at the words, \\"weep not for me, O Mother, for I shall arise...\\", the priest and deacon dramatically lift the Epitaphios (which represents the dead body of Christ) from the bier and carry it through the Holy Doors into the sanctuary, laying it upon the Holy Table (altar), so that its border hangs down in front of the Holy Table and is visible through the open Holy Doors. There it will remain throughout the Paschal season as a reminder of the burial cloth left in the empty tomb (). =Paschal season= During Bright Week (Easter Week), the Holy Doors of the sanctuary remain open as a symbol of the empty tomb of Christ. The Epitaphios is clearly visible through the open doors, and thus symbolizes the winding sheet left in the tomb after the resurrection. At the end of Bright Week, the Holy Doors are closed, but the Epitaphios remains on the Holy Table for 40 days, as a reminder of Jesus' physical appearances to his disciples from the time of his Resurrection until his Ascension into heaven. Epitaphios of the Theotokos Mosaic of the Dormition of the Theotokos, 14th century (Chora Church, Constantinople). An Epitaphios of the Theotokos also exists. This too is a richly embroidered cloth icon, but depicting instead the body of the Theotokos lying in state. This is used on the feast of the Dormition of the Theotokos on 15 August, known in the West as the Assumption of Mary. The Epitaphios of the Theotokos is used with corresponding hymns of lamentation, placed on a bier, and carried in procession in the same way as the Epitaphios of Christ, although it is never placed on the Holy Table. The Rite of the \\"Burial of the Theotokos\\" began in Jerusalem, and from there it was carried to Russia, where it was used in the Uspensky (Dormition) cathedral in Moscow. Its use has slowly spread among the Russian Orthodox, though it is not by any means a standard service in all parishes, or even most cathedrals or monasteries. In Jerusalem, the service is chanted during the All-Night Vigil of the Dormition. In some Russian churches and monasteries, it is served on the third day after Dormition.

Electrons are one type of fermion, and when they are found in such materials, they are sometimes referred to as heavy electrons. Heavy fermion materials have a low-temperature specific heat whose linear term is up to 1000 times larger than the value expected from the free electron model. The properties of the heavy fermion compounds often derive from the partly filled f-orbitals of rare-earth or actinide ions, which behave like localized magnetic moments. The name \\"heavy fermion\\" comes from the fact that the fermion behaves as if it has an effective mass greater than its rest mass. In the case of electrons, below a characteristic temperature (typically 10 K), the conduction electrons in these metallic compounds behave as if they had an effective mass up to 1000 times the free particle mass. This large effective mass is also reflected in a large contribution to the resistivity from electron-electron scattering via the Kadowaki‚ÄìWoods ratio. Heavy fermion behavior has been found in a broad variety of states including metallic, superconducting, insulating and magnetic states. Characteristic examples are CeCu6, CeAl3, CeCu2Si2, YbAl3, UBe13 and UPt3. Historical overview Heavy fermion behavior was discovered by K. Andres, J.E. Graebner and H.R. Ott in 1975, who observed enormous magnitudes of the linear specific heat capacity in CeAl3. While investigations on doped superconductors led to the conclusion that the existence of localized magnetic moments and superconductivity in one material was incompatible, the opposite was shown, when in 1979 Frank Steglich et al. discovered heavy fermion superconductivity in the material CeCu2Si2. The discovery of a quantum critical point and non-Fermi liquid behavior in the phase diagram of heavy fermion compounds by H. von L√∂hneysen et al. in 1994 led to a new rise of interest in the research of these compounds. Another experimental breakthrough was the demonstration (by the group of Gil Lonzarich) that quantum criticality in heavy fermions can be the reason for unconventional superconductivity. Heavy fermion materials play an important role in current scientific research, acting as prototypical materials for unconventional superconductivity, non-Fermi liquid behavior and quantum criticality. The actual interaction between localized magnetic moments and conduction electrons in heavy fermion compounds is still not completely understood and a topic of ongoing investigation. Properties Heavy fermion materials belong to the group of strongly correlated electron systems. Several members of the group of heavy fermion materials become superconducting below a critical temperature. The superconductivity is unconventional. At high temperatures, heavy fermion compounds behave like normal metals and the electrons can be described as a Fermi gas, in which the electrons are assumed to be non-interacting fermions. In this case, the interaction between the f electrons, which present a local magnetic moment and the conduction electrons, can be neglected. The Fermi liquid theory of Lev Landau provides a good model to describe the properties of the most heavy fermion materials at low temperatures. In this theory, the electrons are described by quasiparticles, which have the same quantum numbers and charge, but the interaction of the electrons is taken into account by introducing an effective mass, which differs from the actual mass of a free electron. =Optical properties= Typical frequency-dependent optical conductivity of a heavy fermion compound. Blue line: T > Tcoh. Red line: T < Tcoh. In order to obtain the optical properties of heavy fermion systems, these materials have been investigated by optical spectroscopy measurements. In these experiments the sample is irradiated by electromagnetic waves with tunable wavelength. Measuring the reflected or transmitted light reveals the characteristic energies of the sample. Above the characteristic coherence temperature T_{\\\\rm coh}, heavy fermion materials behave like normal metals; i.e. their optical response is described by the Drude model. Compared to a good metal however, heavy fermion compounds at high temperatures have a high scattering rate because of the large density of local magnetic moments (at least one f electron per unit cell), which cause (incoherent) Kondo scattering. Due to the high scattering rate, the conductivity for dc and at low frequencies is rather low. A conductivity roll-off (Drude roll-off) occurs at the frequency that corresponds to the relaxation rate. Below T_{\\\\rm coh}, the localized f electrons hybridize with the conduction electrons. This leads to the enhanced effective mass, and a hybridization gap develops. In contrast to Kondo insulators, the chemical potential of heavy fermion compounds lies within the conduction band. These changes lead to two important features in the optical response of heavy fermions. The frequency-dependent conductivity of heavy- fermion materials can be expressed by \\\\sigma(\\\\omega)=\\\\frac{ne^2}{m^*}\\\\frac{\\\\tau^*}{1+\\\\omega^2\\\\tau^{*2}}, containing the effective mass m^* and the renormalized relaxation rate \\\\frac{1}{\\\\tau^*}=\\\\frac{m}{m^*}\\\\frac{1}{\\\\tau}. Due to the large effective mass, the renormalized relaxation time is also enhanced, leading to a narrow Drude roll-off at very low frequencies compared to normal metals. The lowest such Drude relaxation rate observed in heavy fermions so far, in the low GHz range, was found in UPd2Al3. The gap-like feature in the optical conductivity represents directly the hybridization gap, which opens due to the interaction of localized f electrons and conduction electrons. Since the conductivity does not vanish completely, the observed gap is actually a pseudogap. At even higher frequencies we can observe a local maximum in the optical conductivity due to normal interband excitations. Heat capacity = Specific heat for normal metals = At low temperature and for normal metals, the specific heat C_P consists of the specific heat of the electrons C_{P, \\\\rm el} which depends linearly on temperature T and of the specific heat of the crystal lattice vibrations (phonons) C_{P, \\\\rm ph} which depends cubically on temperature :C_P = C_{P, \\\\rm el}+C_{P,\\\\rm ph} = \\\\gamma T + \\\\beta T^3 \\\\ with proportionality constants \\\\beta and \\\\gamma. In the temperature range mentioned above, the electronic contribution is the major part of the specific heat. In the free electron model -- a simple model system that neglects electron interaction -- or metals that could be described by it, the electronic specific heat is given by :C_{P, \\\\rm el} = \\\\gamma T = \\\\frac{\\\\pi^2}{2}\\\\frac{k_{\\\\rm B}}{\\\\epsilon_{\\\\rm F}}nk_{\\\\rm B}T with Boltzmann constant k_{\\\\rm B}, the electron density n and the Fermi energy \\\\epsilon_{\\\\rm F} (the highest single particle energy of occupied electronic states). The proportionality constant \\\\gamma is called the Sommerfeld coefficient. = Relation between heat capacity and \\"thermal effective mass\\" = For electrons with a quadratic dispersion relation (as for the free-electron gas), the Fermi energy ŒµF is inversely proportional to the particle's mass m: :\\\\epsilon_{\\\\rm F} = \\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2 k_{\\\\rm F}^2}{2m} where k_{\\\\rm F} stands for the Fermi wave number that depends on the electron density and is the absolute value of the wave number of the highest occupied electron state. Thus, because the Sommerfeld parameter \\\\gamma is inversely proportional to \\\\epsilon_{\\\\rm F}, \\\\gamma is proportional to the particle's mass and for high values of \\\\gamma, the metal behaves as a Fermi gas in which the conduction electrons have a high thermal effective mass. = Example: UBe13 at low temperatures = Experimental results for the specific heat of the heavy fermion compound UBe13 show a peak at a temperature around 0.75 K that goes down to zero with a high slope if the temperature approaches 0 K. Due to this peak, the \\\\gamma factor is much higher than the free electron model in this temperature range. In contrast, above 6 K, the specific heat for this heavy fermion compound approaches the value expected from free-electron theory.  Quantum criticality  The presence of local moment and delocalized conduction electrons leads to a competition of the Kondo interaction (which favors a non-magnetic ground state) and the RKKY interaction (which generates magnetically ordered states, typically antiferromagnetic for heavy fermions). By suppressing the N√©el temperature of a heavy-fermion antiferromagnet down to zero (e.g. by applying pressure or magnetic field or by changing the material composition), a quantum phase transition can be induced. For several heavy- fermion materials it was shown that such a quantum phase transition can generate very pronounced non-Fermi liquid properties at finite temperatures. Such quantum-critical behavior is also studied in great detail in the context of unconventional superconductivity. Examples of heavy-fermion materials with well-studied quantum-critical properties are CeCu6‚àíxAu, CeIn3, CePd2Si2, YbRh2Si2, and CeCoIn5.

Prior to joining congress, he was a businessman and investor, best known as the chairman from 1915 to 1924 of the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company which later became IBM. Biography He was born in Oneonta, New York, to Jesse and Belle Fairchild. His father was a poor farmer. George and his siblings had to help their father on the farm and had little opportunity to study. He attended the local school until he was 14 years old, when he apprenticed to a printer. Primarily self- educated, he rose to prominence through his own effort and enterprise. In 1890, he became the sole proprietor of the Oneonta Herald, a weekly newspaper. He was a pioneer in the time recording industry. In 1896, in association with his friend Harlow N. Bundy, he joined the Bundy Manufacturing Company, a time clock manufacturer, as both an investor and director. In 1900 Fairchild formed the International Time Recording Company as the selling agency of the Bundy Manufacturing Company, Willard and Frick Manufacturing Company, and Standard Time Stamp Company, which also manufactured a card recorder. In 1911, when the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company was formed through the efforts of Charles R. Flint, Fairchild became president of the new company. He later became chairman of the company and continued in this role when, in February 1924, CTR was renamed as IBM. He was chairman of IBM until his death on December 31, 1924. =Congressional career= Apart from manufacturing and journalism, Fairchild was a seasoned politician. He was elected as a Republican to the Sixtieth and to the five succeeding Congresses (March 4, 1907 - March 3, 1919) while elected delegate to Republican National Convention from New York, 1912 and 1916. Fairchild was elected vice president of the International Peace Conference. He was appointed by President Taft on August 10, 1910, as special commissioner to the First Centenary of Mexico at Mexico City, with the rank of Minister. =Marriage and family= He married Josephine Mills Sherman, daughter of William Sherman, of Davenport, Delaware County, New York, on March 18, 1891. They had a son, Sherman Mills Fairchild, who was born on April 7, 1896. His home in Oneonta, known as the Fairchild Mansion, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.

As an electron moves past atoms in the lattice its charge distorts or polarizes the nearby lattice. This effect leads to a decrease in the electron (or hole, as may be the case) mobility, which results in a decreased conductivity. However, as the magnitude of the Seebeck coefficient increases with phonon drag, it may be beneficial in a thermoelectric material for direct energy conversion applications. The magnitude of this effect is typically appreciable only at low temperatures (<200 K). Phonons are not always in local thermal equilibrium; they move against the thermal gradient. They lose momentum by interacting with electrons (or other carriers) and imperfections in the crystal. If the phonon-electron interaction is predominant, the phonons will tend to push the electrons to one end of the material, losing momentum in the process. This contributes to the already present thermoelectric field. This contribution is most important in the temperature region where phonon-electron scattering is predominant. This happens for :T \\\\approx {1 \\\\over 5} \\\\theta_\\\\mathrm{D} where Œ∏D is the Debye temperature. At lower temperatures there are fewer phonons available for drag, and at higher temperatures they tend to lose momentum in phonon-phonon scattering instead of phonon-electron scattering. This region of the Seebeck coefficient-versus-temperature function is highly variable under a magnetic field.

It is a follow- up to the 1964-65 Jonny Quest cartoon series, and its 1986 revival The New Adventures of Jonny Quest from The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera. Jonny's Golden Quest reunites the voice talents of Don Messick as Dr. Benton Quest, Granville Van Dusen as Race Bannon, and Rob Paulsen as Hadji from the 1986 series. The film also features Will Nipper as Jonny Quest, JoBeth Williams as Jade Kenyon, Anndi McAfee as Jessie, and Jeffrey Tambor as Dr. Zin. It is set after and references the continuity of the previous two Jonny Quest series. Plot Team Quest, working as associates for international spy operation Intelligence-One, are given an assignment to investigate occurrences of mutated animals and plant life in Peru. Dr. Benton Quest and his bodyguard \\"Race\\" Bannon bring along Benton's sons Jonny and (adopted from India) Hadji, and their dog Bandit. Also coming along is Benton's biologist wife Dr. Rachel Quest, who usually does not come along on their adventures. Upon arriving in Peru, Race runs into his ex-wife Jade Kenyon, who was sent by Intelligence-One as their civilian contact for the investigation. Just after Jade's arrival, Benton and Rachel are kidnapped by Dr. Zin, who has caused the mutations while perfecting processes to bring monsters called \\"replicants\\" to life. Zin has also been working on cloning technology, and manages to successfully clone himself before Race, Jonny, and Hadji arrive to save Benton and Rachel. However, Rachel is taken hostage by Zin's clone and, after Benton freezes while attempting to shoot down Zin in his hovercraft (as he would have shot Rachel as well), both Rachel and Zin's clone are killed in the erupting volcano. Rachel's murder causes Benton to quit I-1, and drives a wedge into his already strained relationship with Jonny. As he begins shutting down the Quest compound in Mexico, an American girl named Jessie turns up with a mask made of synthetically pure gold, which she tells Team Quest she was to deliver to an associate of her alchemist father, Dr. Victor Devlon. When approached by Intelligence-One to discover the whereabouts of Dr. Devlon and the secrets to his alchemy process, Benton reluctantly accepts. Team Quest and Jessie begin a globe-trotting search for Jessie's father and his associates, pursued at every turn by Dr. Zin and his operatives, one of whom is revealed to be a reluctant Jade. Dr. Quest uses a sentient supercomputer, 3-DAC, to help him, the rest of his team, and Jessie follow the trail of Devlon from Tokyo, to Paris, and then to Rome. During the trip, Jonny and Jessie begin to grow fond of one another, while Jonny's relationship with his father continues to deteriorate. Convinced Benton could have taken the shot and saved Rachel, Jonny swears to kill Zin in revenge, avenge his mother's death, and show up his father. Later that night, after a quick coffee break at the cafe, Team Quest and Jessie enter the catacombs of Rome, where Devlon is hiding out in a makeshift lab. It is revealed Devlon was an employee of Zin's who ran away with an alchemy formula he'd helped invent, as 100% pure gold was the key ingredient to improving his cloning process. However, Devlon got greedy which is the reason he stole the formula for himself. Everything Jessie had told Team Quest about her father and the mask were lies to have them help Zin find Devlon, as Zin had kidnapped Jessie's mother - Jade - and forced them to play parts in his schemes. Dr. Zin kills Devlon and kidnaps Race with a tentacled robot, taking him to a compound in the Australian Outback to use Race's DNA to improve the vitality of Zin's own clones. When Zin's intelligent replicant bodyguard Snipe prepares to execute the rest of the group himself, Hadji attempts to hypnotize him into letting them go, but Snipe is unaffected by hypnosis, so Hadji brings the mummies to life. They attack and kill Snipe, allowing Team Quest, Jessie and Jade to get away. Jade later reveals to Jessie that Race is her father. The group arrive at the Australian compound to save Race and destroy Zin's robot along with the remaining replicants, but when Zin captures Benton and Jonny is faced with the same dilemma of whether or not he can take a shot at Zin while he is holding Benton hostage, Jonny freezes as well. However, he is able to use a dolphin communicator his mother had given him to get a pair of dolphins to bump Zin away from his father. Zin escapes to a getaway submarine and sends a missile to destroy the compound. This plan backfires when Zin's sub ends up trapped beneath falling debris, and he is left to die. As the plant begins to explode, Jonny is separated from the rest of Team Quest in their escape, but his dolphin friends lead him safely out of the compound underwater. Jonny and Benton reconcile, and Benton makes a full-fledged return to Intelligence-One work. Race, who now knows Jessie is his daughter, joins Jessie and Jade on a sea cruise vacation - but not before Jessie gives Jonny a goodbye kiss. As the Bannon-Kenyon family sets sail, one of Dr. Zin's clones is revealed to be floating in the ocean waters in a tube, having survived the explosion of the Australian compound. Relation to previous works The main plot of Jonny's Golden Quest repurposes the storyline of \\"Deadly Junket,\\" an episode of The New Adventures of Jonny Quest. In that episode, a little girl appears to ask the Quest party to help her find her missing father, a scientist kidnapped by Dr. Zin. Here, the girl, Jessie, is ultimately revealed to have been lying about her identity, and her parents are really Race and his romantic interest from two episodes of the original series, Jade.

History The entrance to St. John's Seminary St. John's Seminary began teaching seminarians on September 12, 1939. Juan Camarillo, Jr. donated of land from his Rancho Calleguas on March 3, 1927 with the specific desire to have the land used for a seminary named for St. John the Evangelist. On January 14, 1938, John J. Cantwell announced the planned construction of the seminary. The Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada first accredited St. John's in 1976; it had previously been accredited by the American Association of Theological Schools and the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. Beginning in 1961, St. John's granted bachelor's degrees through its subsidiary St. John's Seminary College. Following a 2002 report from a task force appointed by Roger Mahony, the Archdiocese of Los Angeles closed the undergraduate portion of the seminary. Only 12 seminarians graduated in 2002, and the Archdiocese chose to focus solely on graduate training. The task force also scheduled a 2005 review to see if St. John's should be entirely closed with Loyola Marymount University taking over the school's functions; this shutdown has not come to pass. The diocese agreed to sell most of the seminary's land, including the area used for undergraduate study, in 2004, for a price which was dependent on the sort of zoning approval the land would receive. The seminary now seeks to become self-sufficient rather than relying on the archdiocese's funding. Toward that end, they are seeking to have an area formerly used as an undergraduate campus developed into between 270 and 290 houses for people 55 and older. Library The campus of St. John's has two libraries: the Edward Laurence Doheny Memorial Library and the Carrie Estelle Doheny Memorial Library, named for an oil tycoon and his wife who were noted Roman Catholic philanthropists. The Edward L. Doheny Library, inspired by the Cathedral of Mexico City, houses the seminary's collection of theological books, periodicals, and audiovisual materials, as well as the Seminary Board Room and other meeting spaces. The Carrie E. Doheny Library was the library of the undergraduate program until it was discontinued in 2002; since then it has been used to house the seminary's philosophy books as well as offices and classroom space. For nearly half a century, the Edward L. Doheny Library also housed the collection of rare books and other treasures donated to the seminary by Carrie Estelle Doheny in 1940. The collection was sold at auction in 1987 in order to fund the Doheny Endowment to support seminary functions. Academics St. John's offers the Master of Divinity degree as a first professional degree for seminarians. If interested in theological studies and research, eligible seminarians can also concurrently earn a Master of Arts. The seminary offers a Master of Arts in Pastoral Ministry for non-seminarians who are interested in lay ministry. Controversy =Sexual abuse= Alumni of St. John were accused in the sexual abuse scandal, which broke into public in the late 20th century, of molesting the underaged. Of the approximately 625 St. John's graduates to be ordained by the Los Angeles Archdiocese between 1950 and 2005, by 2005 65 had been accused in the sexual abuse scandal, reflecting a rate higher than what studies have found for U.S. priests in general. A seminary spokesman noted in November 2005 that California had extended its statute of limitations on molestation lawsuits, making more cases possible for prosecution. He suggested that a wave of publicity on molestation by priests had made St. John's graduates targets of such accusations. Four days later, the Los Angeles Times ran a letter to the editor from St. John's rector, Helmut A. Hefner. He said that substantial reforms had been implemented in the seminary in terms of recruitment and assessment of students. He noted that changes had been made; as a result, from 1985 to 2005, only two of the 155 priests ordained at St. John's Seminary for the Los Angeles archdiocese had been accused of sexual misconduct.

The summit of Maiden Peak consists of a steeper cinder cone which sits atop the underlying shield volcano. It is located on the Cascade Crest, which forms the boundary between Lane County and Deschutes County.

Biography Kinoshita was born in Los Angeles and grew up in Boyle Heights neighborhood. After graduating from Roosevelt High School, he went to the University of Southern California to study architecture. Kinoshita graduated from USC in 1940 with a bachelor's degree in architecture and design. During World War II, Kinoshita and his wife Lillian Matsuyama were interned at the Poston War Relocation Center in Arizona. His career as a screenwriter started with Hundred Men and a Girl in 1937, while it took several years post war before he returned to the big screen in 1956 for the special effects tasks and built the famous Robby the Robot in Forbidden Planet, although without credit.  Robots and Kinoshita  Kinoshita is best known as the designer of three of the most famous robots in science fiction: Tobor from the 1954 film Tobor the Great as well as the 1957 television pilot Here Comes Tobor; Robby the Robot from the films Forbidden Planet in 1956 and The Invisible Boy in 1957; and Environmental Control Robot from the 1960s TV series Lost in Space, which was called \\"Robot\\". Created at a cost of anywhere between $125,000 and $1,000,000 ‚Äî depending on which source is quoted ‚Äî and measuring around 7 feet (213 cm) tall, Robby the Robot was the result of the efforts of a number of individuals, although the final design as it appeared in Forbidden Planet is usually attributed to Kinoshita, who was head draftsman of the art department, and who produced the working drawings and blueprints for Robby's construction under the supervision of art director A. Arnold \\"Buddy\\" Gillespie at MGM.  As an art director for films  Around April 1965, Irwin Allen hired Kinoshita as the art director for the Lost in Space series. Of the many tasks to befall Kinoshita, two of them were to come up with a robot (which he nicknamed \\"Blinky\\") and to redesign the pilot film's Gemini XII space ship into what would become the Jupiter 2. This robot never had a real name‚Äîonly the model number \\"B9.\\" In the show he was referred to as \\"the robot\\" or called by the generic name, \\"Robot.\\" He was brought to life by the combination of actor Bob May and voice actor Dick Tufeld. Two of Kinoshita's famous robots appeared faceplate-to-faceplate in the Lost in Space episodes \\"War of the Robots\\" and \\"Condemned of Space\\", where Robby the Robot appeared as a guest robotoid and robot, respectively. Among his credits are art direction on four other well- known TV shows: Highway Patrol (1955‚Äì1959), Bat Materson (1960‚Äì1961), Hawaii Five-O (1970‚Äì1971), and Kojak (1973‚Äì1974). Kinoshita also contributed production design to several features including The Phantom Planet (1961). The B9 robot fan club provided photos of Kinoshita on his 94th birthday as well as an interview. Robert Kinoshita turned 100 in February 2014 and died in December 2014.

The rebellion that led to its formation and its collapse are known as the Fujian Incident ( or ) or Fujian Rebellion.  Background  Map of the Administrative divisions of the Fujian People's Government In November 1933 some leaders of the National Revolutionary Army's 19th Route Army‚Äîincluding Cai Tingkai, Chen Mingshu and Jiang Guangnai, who had gained fame for their role in the January 28 Incident‚Äîwere deployed to southern China to suppress a Communist rebellion. Instead, they negotiated peace with the rebels. In alliance with other Kuomintang forces under Li Jishen (), the 19th Route leaders broke with Chiang Kai-shek and took control of Fujian, where they were stationed, and on 22 November 1933, proclaimed a new government. The chairman of the government was Li Jishen, Eugene Chen () was foreign minister, Jiang Guangnai was finance minister and Cai Tingkai was military head and governor of Fujian Province. Deputies of the Chinese National People's Provisional Congress The flag was red, symbolizing the proletariat, and blue, symbolizing the peasants, with a yellow star in the middle symbolizing the glorious unity of the productive people. The name of the new state was the \\"Republic of China\\" (), with its founding being year one. The 19th Route Army was renamed the People's Revolutionary Army. Chen Mingshu led the newly created Productive People's Party, while it had support from the \\"Third Party\\". The Chinese Youth Party considered supporting them, but were put off by their leftism and lack of realistic sustainability. The rebellion initially enjoyed popular support among most Fujianese, but high taxes to support the army decreased its popularity. In addition, the new government's decision to break continuity by issuing a new flag, new symbols and occasionally removing the portrait of the revered leader Dr. Sun Yat-sen caused hesitation in many quarters. After adopting a wait-and-see approach, the New Guangxi clique declined to support the rebels. Feng Yuxiang was widely expected to be supportive, but he remained silent. Chen Jitang and Hu Hanmin were sympathetic to their goals, but condemned them for dividing the country. The fear of a new civil war at a time of Japanese aggression was the main reason why the rebellion had very little popularity. The rebels were motivated by, among other things, personal disagreements with Chiang Kai-shek, opposition to perceived appeasement of Japan and their assignment to the then relatively poor Fujian. The goals of the new government included the overthrow of the Kuomintang government in Nanjing, various social and political reforms and stronger resistance to foreign interference in China. The rebellion brought a temporary halt to the central government's Fifth Encirclement Campaign in southeast China. However, implied or promised aid to the rebellion from the Communist Party's Jiangxi Soviet failed to materialize due to opposition by the 28 Bolsheviks and the effort began to collapse. The Kuomintang responded to the rebellion first with air attacks and, in January 1934, a ground offensive that quickly led to the defeat of the formerly prestigious 19th Route Army. On 13 January 1934, the government was defeated and its leaders fled or defected to Chiang Kai-shek's forces.  Notes   References  * William F. Dorrill.

Addressing CMCDS typically requires prior understanding of credit default swaps. In a CMCDS the protection buyer does not makes periodic payments to the protection seller (these payments constitute the premium leg), and in return receives a payoff (protection or default leg) if an underlying financial instrument defaults. Differently from a standard CDS, the premium leg of a CMCDS does not pay a fixed and pre-agreed amount but a floating spread, using a traded CDS as a reference index. More precisely, given a pre-assigned time-to-maturity, at any payment instant of the premium leg the rate that is offered is indexed at a traded CDS spread on the same reference credit existing in that moment for the pre-assigned time-to-maturity (hence the name \\"constant maturity\\" CDS). The default or protection leg is mostly the same as the leg of a standard CDS. Often CMCDS are expressed in terms of participation rate. The participation rate may be defined as the ratio between the present value of the premium leg of a standard CDS with the same final maturity and the present value of the premium leg of the constant maturity CDS. CMCDS may be combined with CDS on the same entity to take only spread risk and not default risk on an entity. Indeed, as the default leg is the same, buying a CDS and selling a CMCDS or vice versa will offset the default legs and leave only the difference in the premium legs, that are driven by spread risk.

She joined the company in 1995 and became the top star in February 2007 upon the resignation of Kei Takashiro, which made her the first otokoyaku to be top in her class. She resigned from the company in July, 2009, and is currently pursuing a stage career. She is from Bunky≈ç, Tokyo.  Troupe history  * Moon Troupe: 1996‚Äì2003 * Cosmos Troupe: 2003‚Äì2009  Biography  Y≈´ga Yamato began her career in Takarazuka in 1995. She was one of the young stars that were promoted by the company in 1999 (along with Sumire Haruno, the former top star for Flower Troupe and Hikaru Asami, the former top star for Snow Troupe). Before she was promoted to top star, she was considered as one of top-stars-in-waiting along with Kei Takashiro, the former top star for Cosmos Troupe, Kei Aran, the current top star for Star Troupe, Jun Sena, the current top star for Moon Troupe, and Natsuki Mizu, the current top star of Snow Troupe. Even when she was in her underclassman years, she was already in some roles that were quite inside the nuclear cast of the regular cast production. Along with Y≈´hi ≈åzora and Hiromu Kiriya, they were the major trio for the young batch in Moon Troupe. When the trio were still underclassmen, they were always cast in the title roles for the new actor production alternatively. When Jun Shibuki became the top star for Moon Troupe, she became the second man for Shibuki. In 2003, she was transferred to Cosmos Troupe, rejoining Natsuki Mizu, former troupe mate from Moon Troupe. It seemed that she had been downgraded when she is in the role of Rolan Sabatier (considered a role for a third-tier actor) in Lightning in the Daytime. But it was proven wrong when she was in the role of Barak in Calaf & Turandot in the Hakataza Theater performance (replacing Mizu who had a Bow Hall performance at the same time). In the same year, she went on stage with Kei Aran of Star Troupe for Singin' in the Rain. Same as Mizu, she had a special appearance in 2004 for the Star Troupe in A Love Story in 1914 and Ch'Ang-an: Full of Swirling Flowers (replacing Kei Aran in the Hakataza Theater performance). Also she got her solo lead performance The Last Party: S.Fitzgerald‚Äôs Last Day at Bow Hall. In 2005, with the sudden troupe transfer for Mizu, she became the solo second man for Y≈çka Wao. With the resignment of Wao and her successor Kei Takashiro, she became the fourth top star for the youngest troupe of the company, and the youngest of the five. In 2013, she starred in the Sera Myu revival as Tuxedo Mask, and made her TV drama debut in the series Higanjima.

It is a part of the Shikotsu-Toya National Park.  Geography  Lake Shikotsu is located in the south-west part of Hokkaid≈ç. It has an average depth of and a maximum depth of , making it the second deepest lake in Japan, after Lake Tazawa. It is the 8th-largest lake by surface area in Japan and the second largest of Japan's caldera lakes, surpassed only by Lake Kussharo. It is surrounded by three volcanos: Mount Eniwa to the north and Mount Fuppushi and Mount Tarumae to the south. The caldera formed in the holocene when the land between the volcanos subsided. Due to its depth, the volume of Lake Shikotsu reaches 3/4 of the volume of Lake Biwa, Japan's largest lake, despite of having only 1/9 of that lake's surface area. Due to the small surface area to depth ratio, the water temperature remains quite constant throughout the year, making it the northernmost ice-free lake in Japan. The Bifue, Okotanpe, Ninaru and Furenai rivers feed into it, and its main outlet is the Chitose River. Geology The caldera on which Lake Shikotsu sits was formed 40 to 50 thousand years ago. According to the Global Volcanism Program, the caldera was formed 31 to 34 thousand years ago by one of Hokkaid≈ç's largest quaternary eruptions. The caldera consists mainly of dacite, rhyolite, and andesite. The volcanoes Mount Tarumae, Mount Eniwa, and Mount Fuppushi formed on the rim of this caldera. Origin of the name The name of Lake Shikotsu derives from the Ainu language shikot, meaning big depression or hollow. To the Japanese, this sounded too much like , so they attempted to rename it engi, but this name did not stick., , page 60  Use  The red salmon (locally called \\"chippu\\"), introduced from Lake Akan in 1895, has become a noted product of the area and chippu fishing is now a favourite pastime in summer. A visitor centre, various campgrounds and Onsen provide facilities for tourists coming to the area. Chitose is famous for its ‚ÄúIndian Fish Wheel‚Äù, a device situated in Chitose River to collect salmon returning to spawn at Lake Shikotsu.  Transport  National Highway 276 runs along the southern bank, connecting the lake with Tomakomai and Date. Highway 453 runs from the eastern and northern parts of the lake to Sapporo. City bus routes from Chitose lead to the lake. Hokkaid≈ç- Ch≈´≈ç buses connect Shikotsu-ko with Chitose Station and New Chitose Airport. In the summer, there is also a bus from Sapporo Terminal.

An incomplete list of these characters appears below. Willis family =Helen Willis= Helen Willis (n√©e Douglas) (portrayed by Roxie Roker, except for her first appearance in All in the Family, when she was portrayed by Kim Hamilton.) is Louise's best friend and George's nemesis. She has been married to Tom Willis, a white man, for 34 years. George, opposed to miscegenation, calls Helen and Tom \\"zebras\\" or \\"chocolate and vanilla\\". Helen often strikes back by calling George \\"shorty\\". In the fourth season, Helen works with Louise as volunteers at the Help Center, a social services facility, which opened in 1977. Helen and Tom have two children: Jennifer \\"Jenny\\" Willis (Berlinda Tolbert) and Allan Willis (Jay Hammer and Andrew Rubin). Kerry Washington portrayed Helen in 2019 for Live in Front of a Studio Audience. =Tom Willis= Thomas \\"Tom\\" Willis (portrayed by Franklin Cover, except for his first appearance in All in the Family, when he was portrayed by Charles Aidman as Louis Willis.) is an author and president of his publishing company, Pelham Publishers. He lives a content life with his wife Helen. Tom is white and Helen is black, which often makes them the butt of George's insults and jokes. Tom and Helen, however, have both learned to ignore the bigotry of their neighbor. In their initial appearance on the parent show, Tom states that they had met \\"his\\" kind‚Äîblack and white‚Äîand they always handled it. His daughter, Jenny Willis (who more resembles her mother in skin color), marries George's son, Lionel, in 1976. He develops a strong relationship with Jenny, but was never close to his \\"white\\" son, Allan Willis (Jay Hammer) because he never finished school and left New York City and stayed in Paris for two years. As the series went on (particularly after Lionel and Jenny married), George and Tom eventually became good friends, though George continued to make jokes about Tom's weight. Sherman Hemsley felt that it would be insulting to continue the racially themed insults after the characters became friends. Tom is a caring person, but often dominated by his wife. He is known to be a horrible dancer, as indicated in a few episodes. He also reluctantly goes along with George's constant schemes, but generally prefers to be left out of them. Will Ferrell portrayed Tom in 2019 for Live in Front of a Studio Audience. =Allan Willis= Allan Willis (Andrew Harold Rubin/Jay Hammer) is the Willises' only son and older brother of Jenny. Andrew Rubin appears as this character in the first season finale episode entitled \\"Jenny's Low\\" (aired on April 12, 1975), in which Allan returns from Europe, and is treated coldly by his sister. Jenny harbors jealousy of Allan as he turned out to be \\"white\\". They eventually reconcile. Beginning with the 1978‚Äì79 season, Allan was portrayed by Jay Hammer, who joined the cast in a two-part episode of the season opener. Allan returns from New Mexico, while his parents return from Syracuse after Tom's father dies. Allan is left the Fortune Warehouse in the will and the relationship between Tom and Allan becomes very cold because of his \\"happy-go-lucky\\" attitude. Allan is well known for his sharp rebuttals to George's insults and his well-rounded personality. After the 1978-79 season, Hammer was fired from the show cast, and it was explained that Allan moved to Minnesota. Allan was also chosen to be the godfather of Jenny's daughter Jessica, but when he became snowed in, Harry Bentley was chosen as the proxy. Jefferson family =Mother Olivia Jefferson= Mother Jefferson (portrayed by Zara Cully) is Henry and George's mother. Her first appearance was in the All in the Family episode \\"Lionel's Engagement,\\" when she takes offense at being referred to as \\"mammy\\" by Archie Bunker, who thinks the term is a variation of \\"mommy.\\" Mother Jefferson is a catty, disparaging and antagonistic mother-in-law to Louise, while appearing to be a sweet old lady to everyone else. Mother Jefferson is a stereotypical mother-in-law who thinks her daughter-in-law isn't good enough for George. She would frequently torment Louise by criticizing her cooking, her age or her overall character, but Louise frequently came back at her with a witty albeit sarcastic response. (On a couple of rare occasions, however, Mother Jefferson sides with Louise, when she takes offense at George's boorish or sexist behavior [\\"George and the Manager\\"].) In the January 1976 episode \\"Mother Jefferson's Birthday\\", it is revealed that Olivia Jefferson was born in February 1901 and that she has a younger sister, Emma, who was born in 1906. On February 9, 1951, both sisters were in a church bingo game in which the prize was an electric blanket, but they quarreled over which card won the prize and didn't speak to each other for 25 years. After her husband was killed in an accident, Olivia supported her two sons by working as a domestic. A long-running gag had Mother Jefferson blissfully ignorant of how much alcohol she actually consumes, usually in the form of a Bloody Mary, which she stated she drank \\"for the vitamins\\". Cully had been absent from the first 17 episodes of the third season because of a serious case of pneumonia caused by a collapsed lung. Upon recovering, she returned for a few episodes, noticeably thinner and more frail. She died early in the fourth season, and the writers decided to eliminate Mother Jefferson's character rather than to replace her with a different actress. No special episode was created centering on her death, but it was briefly referenced in the second episode of the fifth season, \\"Homecoming (Part 1)\\". =Jenny Jefferson= Jenny Willis-Jefferson (portrayed by Berlinda Tolbert, except for her first appearance in All in the Family, when she was portrayed by Lynne Moody) is the only daughter of Helen and Tom Willis, the younger of their two children. Jenny is an intelligent person, finishing college with her boyfriend, Lionel Jefferson. At first, George often disapproved of Jenny loving Lionel merely because she is biracial, or as George called her, a \\"zebra\\". However, after George discovered Jenny was pregnant with his grandchild, he changed his ways and became much more accepting of her. In 1976, Jenny married Lionel, though they divorced in 1985 after nine years of marriage. She and Lionel have a daughter named Jessica, played by Erin Hollin and Leslie Hollin (Seasons 6‚Äì7) and later by Ebonie Smith (Seasons 10‚Äì11). At first, Jenny disliked her brother Allan when he came home after two years in Paris, mainly because she turned out \\"black\\" and he turned out \\"white\\", though they reconcile. Others =Florence Johnston= Florence Johnston (Marla Gibbs) is the Jeffersons' sassy, backtalking, wisecracking maid. Her first appearance is actually in the pilot episode, when she was interviewed and hired as the Jeffersons' housekeeper. She is lazy and not especially good at her job, and she regularly bickers with George, who repeatedly complains about Florence's laziness and cooking, paying her very little (in one episode, he says her cooking tastes like dog food; she replies it should because she's \\"cooking for a chihuahua\\"). Several times he was on the verge of firing her, but Louise, who thinks of Florence as one of the family, forces him not to. Originally a recurring character, Gibbs later became part of the core of the series as a regular character appearing in 207 of the 253 episodes. Despite being a decent Christian woman (as Gibbs is in real life), Florence never kept a long relationship with men. In a second-season episode, Florence contemplates suicide but is talked out of it by George, who shows his humanity despite his gruff exterior. In an early third-season episode, Florence becomes the Jeffersons' full-time maid, taking Lionel's room after he marries Jenny and finds a place of his own. At first, George refused to allow her to move in, but she helped him escape a sham financial deal with a couple of con artists, and George was grateful. Gibbs starred as Florence in the failed spinoff series Checking In, in which the character became the head of housekeeping for a large hotel. She reprised her role as Florence in 2019 for Live in Front of a Studio Audience. =Harry Bentley= Harry Bentley (Paul Benedict) is the Jeffersons' eccentric English next-door neighbor. Bentley works as a Russian-language interpreter at the United Nations. He is known to https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Jeffersons_supporting_characters#cite_note-2 as a kind, gentle fellow, but George mostly finds him to be weird and annoying, frequently slamming the door in his face. A running gag involved George helping Bentley with his back spasms by walking on Bentley's back. Bentley often tells stories about his childhood in England and his bizarre family. Bentley lives alone, but several times brings home a lady friend. Two of Bentley's most-talked-about ladies are Daphne and Patricia. Benedict left the series in late 1981 at the start of the eighth season of the sitcom. The character of Bentley was written out, saying he went to live in the Soviet Union for two years. Benedict returned to the show in its final two seasons, when George becomes much friendlier to him. Stephen Tobolowsky portrayed Bentley in 2019 for Live in Front of a Studio Audience. =Ralph Hart= Ralph Hart (Ned Wertimer) is the money-crazed doorman of the high-rise Colby East apartment complex. Although he appears to be a hard-working fellow with a decent attitude, he is obsessed with receiving tips. =Jimmy= Jimmy (Garrett Morris) was supposedly a child that George and Louise has sponsored and sent money to for years. However, in their first visit with Jimmy, they realize he is an adult and a con man. =Charlie= Charlie (Danny Wells) owns a bar in the first-floor lobby of the Colby East apartment complex. He is usually talkative with his customers, especially the Jeffersons and the Willis'. George's employees =Marcus Garvey Henderson= Marcus Garvey Henderson (Ernest Harden Jr.) is George's young employee at Jefferson Cleaners. Marcus grew up in a rough neighborhood and steals a jacket from the store on his first day, blaming it on his station in life. However, he becomes a trusted worker. =Leroy Daniels= Leroy Daniels (Vernon Washington) is George's store manager/employee at Jefferson Cleaners. He was born around 1938 and, though talented at managing the store, is occasionally dimwitted. =Hugo= Hugo Mojoloweski (Irwin Keyes) is George's occasional bodyguard, who was originally hired by George to protect him from a serial mugger and career criminal nicknamed \\"Larry The Loon\\" in Season 7.

The mechanism features an intermediate coordination complex that contains both the growing polymer chain and the monomer (alkene). These ligands combine within the coordination sphere of the metal to form a polymer chain that is elongated by two carbons.Hartwig, J. F. Organotransition Metal Chemistry, from Bonding to Catalysis; University Science Books: New York, 2010. The box represents a vacant (or extremely labile) coordination site. Step i involves binding of the monomer to the metal and step ii involves the migratory insertion step. These steps, which alternate from one side of the metal center to the other, are repeated many times for each polymer chain. The details of this mechanism can be used to explain the stereoregularity of the polymerisation of alkenes using Ziegler‚ÄìNatta or metallocene catalysts. Stereoregularity is relevant for unsymmetrical alkenes such as propylene. The coordination sphere of the metal ligands sterically influences which end of the propylene attaches to the growing polymer chain and the relative stereochemistry of the methyl groups on the polymer. The stereoregularity is influenced by the ligands. For the metallocene catalysts, the cyclopentadienyl ligands (or their surrogates) fulfill this role. For heterogeneous catalysts, the stereoregularity is determined by the surface structure around the active site on the catalyst particle, and can be influenced by additives such as succinates or phthalates, which tend to block specific sites, while leaving others (with different stereoreactivity) to catalyse the polymerization.

Until the early 20th century, it was known as Bohemian.  Early West Slavic  Among the innovations in common West Slavic is the palatalization of velar ch > ≈° (v—å≈°—å 'all'), while s (v—ås—å) developed in the East and South Slavic dialects. Within West Slavic, Czech and Slovak separated from Polish around the 10th to 12th centuries. Some other changes took place during roughly the 10th century: * the disappearance and vocalization of yers according to Havl√≠k‚Äôs Yer Law (b—äz—ä > bez, b—äza > bza (gen.), later bezu 'elder, lilac'); * the contraction of groups vowel + j + vowel (dobriji > dobr‚Äô√≠, dobroje > dobr√© 'good'); * the denasalization of nasal ƒô [·∫Ω] > √§ and «´ [√µ] > u. The disappearance of the odd yers strengthened the phonological contrast of palatalized (softened) and unpalatalized consonants, and resulted in alterations of epenthetic e and ‚àÖ (null-phoneme). The contrast of the vowel quantity (length) was also strengthened. The depalatalization of consonants preceding e and √§ took place later, thus the frequency of occurrence of palatalized consonants was lowered, but it strengthened the palatalization contrast at the same time. The change of ‚Äô√§ > ƒõ and √§ > a took place at the end of the 12th century. The vowels were front (√§, e, i, ƒõ) and back (a, o, u), and the front ones had their back variants (allophones), and vice versa. The consonants were divided into hard (b, p, v, m, t, d, r, l, n, c, z, s, k, g, ch) and soft ‚Äì palatal or palatalized (t‚Äô, d‚Äô, ≈ô, l‚Äô, n‚Äô, c‚Äô, s‚Äô, z‚Äô, ƒç, ≈°, ≈æ, j, ≈à). This division was cardinal for the later development. The spirantisation of Slavic /g/ to /h/ is an areal feature shared by Ukrainian (and some southern Russian dialects), Belarusian, Slovak, Czech, Sorbian (but not Polish) and minority of Slovene dialects. This innovation appears to have travelled from east to west, and is sometimes attributed to contact with Scytho-Sarmatian.–ê–±–∞–µ–≤ –í. –ò. –û –ø—Ä–æ–∏—Å—Ö–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏–∏ —Ñ–æ–Ω–µ–º—ã g (h) –≤ —Å–ª–∞–≤—è–Ω—Å–∫–æ–º —è–∑—ã–∫–µ // –ü—Ä–æ–±–ª–µ–º—ã –∏–Ω–¥–æ–µ–≤—Ä–æ–ø–µ–π—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —è–∑—ã–∫–æ–∑–Ω–∞–Ω–∏—è. –ú., 1964, 115‚Äî121. –≠–¥–µ–ª—å–º–∞–Ω –î. –ò. –ö –ø—Ä–æ–∏—Å—Ö–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏—é –∏—Ä–∞–Ω–æ-—Å–ª–∞–≤—è–Ω—Å–∫–∏—Ö –¥–∏–∞—Ö—Ä–æ–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –ø–∞—Ä–∞–ª–µ–ª–µ–π // –°–ª–∞–≤—è–Ω—Å–∫–∞—è —è–∑—ã–∫–æ–≤–∞—è –∏ —ç—Ç–Ω–æ—è–∑—ã–∫–æ–≤–∞—è —Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º—ã –≤ –∫–æ–Ω—Ç–∞–∫—Ç–µ —Å –Ω–µ—Å–ª–∞–≤—è–Ω—Å–∫–∏–º –æ–∫—Ä—É–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ–º. –ú., 2002, 76‚Äî77. It is approximately dated to the 12th century in Slovak, the 12th to 13th century in Czech and the 14th century in Upper Sorbian.Pronk-Tiethoff, The Germanic loanwords in Proto-Slavic, 2013, p. 71 (fn 26)) In the nominal declension, the traditional division according to the word-stem ending was progressively replaced by the gender principle (masculine, feminine and neuter) There were also three grammatical numbers: singular, dual and plural. The dual is also applied in verb conjugations. The past is expressed by aorist, imperfect, perfect and pluperfect. The future tense is not fixed yet; the present tense is often used instead. The contrast of perfective and imperfective aspects is not fully developed yet, there are also biaspectual and no-aspectual verbs. The Proto-Slavic supine was used after verbs of motion, but it was replaced by the infinitive. However, the contemporary infinitive ending -t formally continues the supine.  Old Czech = Earliest records = The earliest written records of Czech date to the 12th to 13th century, in the form of personal names, glosses and short notes. The oldest known complete Czech sentence is a note on the foundation charter of the Litomƒõ≈ôice chapter at the beginning of the 13th century: :Pauel dal ge≈øt plo≈øcoucih zemu / Wlah dalge≈øt dola≈ø zemu i≈øuiatemu ≈øcepanu ≈øeduema du≈ønicoma bogucea a≈øedlatu :(in transcription: Pavel dal jest Plo≈°kovc√≠ch zem‚Äôu. Vlach dal jest Dol√°s zem‚Äôu i sv‚Äôat√©mu ≈†ƒçep√°nu se dvƒõma du≈°n√≠koma Boguƒçeja a Sedlatu.) The earliest texts were written in primitive orthography, which used the letters of the Latin alphabet without any diacritics, resulting in ambiguities, such as in the letter c representing the k /k/, c /ts/ and ƒç /t É/ phonemes. Later during the 13th century, the digraph orthography begins to appear, although not systematically. Combinations of letters (digraphs) are used for recording Czech sounds, e.g. rs for ≈ô. Large changes take place in Czech phonology in the 12th and 13th centuries. Front and back variants of vowels are removed, e.g. ‚Äô√§ > ƒõ (ie) and ‚Äôa > ƒõ (v‚ÄôaÃãce > viece 'more', p‚Äô√§kn√Ω > pƒõkn√Ω 'nice'). In the morphology, these changes deepened the differences between hard and soft noun types (sedl√°ka 'farmer (gen.)' ‚Üî or√°ƒçƒõ 'ploughman (gen.)'; mƒõsta 'towns' ‚Üî mor‚Äôƒõ 'seas'; ≈æena 'woman' ‚Üî du≈°ƒõ 'soul') as well as verbs (volati 'to call' ‚Üî s√°zƒõti 'to plant out'). The hard syllabic l changed to lu (Chlmec > Chlumec, dƒ∫g√Ω > dl√∫h√Ω 'long'), as opposite to soft l‚Äô. The change of g to , and later to , had been in progress since the 12th century. Later assibilation of palatalized alveolars (t‚Äô > c‚Äô, d‚Äô > dz‚Äô and r‚Äô > rs‚Äô) occurred. However, c‚Äô and dz‚Äô disappeared later, but the change of r‚Äô > rs‚Äô > ≈ô became permanent. =14th century= In the 14th century, Czech began to penetrate various literary styles. Official documents in Czech exist at the end of the century. The digraph orthography is applied. The older digraph orthography: ch = ch; chz = ƒç; cz = c; g = j; rs, rz = ≈ô; s = ≈æ or ≈°; w = v; v = u; zz = s; z = z; ie, ye = ƒõ; the graphemes i and y are interchangeable. The vowel length is not usually denoted, doubled letters are used rarely. Obligatory regulations did not exist. This is why the system was not always applied precisely. After 1340, the later digraph orthography was applied: ch = ch; cz = c or ƒç; g = j; rs, rz = ≈ô; s = s or ≈°; ss = s or ≈°; w = v; v = u; z = z or ≈æ, syllable-final y = j; ie, ye = ƒõ. The graphemes i and y remain interchangeable. The punctuation mark is sometimes used in various shapes. Its function is to denote pauses. The changes of ‚Äôu > i (kl‚Äô√∫ƒç > kl√≠ƒç 'key') and ‚Äôo > ƒõ (ko≈à√≥m > koniem '(to) horses') took place. The so-called main historical depalatalization, initiated in the 13th century, was finished. Palatalized (softened) consonants either merged with their hard counterparts or became palatal (ƒè, ≈•, ≈à). The depalatalization did not temporarily concern hard and soft l, which merged to one middle l later at the turn of the 14th and 15th centuries. In this context, the phoneme ƒõ [ ≤e] disappeared. The short ƒõ either changed to e or was dissociated to j + e (pƒõna [pjena] 'foam') before labial consonants in the pronunciation. The long ƒõ was diphthongized to ie (chtieti 'to want', ƒçie≈°e 'goblet', piesek 'sand'). At the same time, the long √≥ was diphthongized to uo (s√≥l > suol 'salt'). In pronunciation, regressive assimilation of voice was enforced (with the exception of h, ≈ô and v). The voicedness became the main contrastive feature of consonants after the disappearance of palatalization. The original pronunciation of v was probably bilabial (as preserved in some Eastern-Bohemian dialects in syllable-final positions: diwnej 'peculiar', stowka 'a hundred'), but in the 14th century, the articulation was adapted to the unvoiced labiodental f. Prothetic v- has been added to all words beginning with o- (voko instead of oko 'eye') in the Bohemian dialects since this period. In morphology, the future tense of imperfective verbs was fixed. The type budu volati 'I will call' became preferred to other types (chc‚Äôu volati 'I want to call', jm√°m volati 'I have to call', and budu volal 'I will have called'). The contrastive feature of (im)perfectiveness was also stabilized. The perfectivization function of prefixes and the imperfectivization function of suffixes are applied. As a consequence of this, aorist and imperfect start disappearing little by little and are replaced by the perfect (now called preterite, since it became the only past tense in Czech). The periphrastic passive voice is formed. = Hussite period = Text from the 1417 Bible of Olomouc The period of the 15th century from the beginning of Jan Hus's preaching activity to the beginning of Czech humanism. The number of literary language users enlarges. Czech fully penetrates the administration. Around 1406, a reform of the orthography was suggested in De orthographia bohemica, a work attributed to Jan Hus ‚Äì the so- called diacritic orthography. For recording of soft consonants, digraphs are replaced by a dot above letters. The acute is used to denote the vowel length. The digraph ch and the grapheme w are preserved. The interchangeability of the graphemes i and y is cancelled. The suggestion is a work of an individual person, therefore this graphic system was accepted slowly, the digraph orthography was still in use. As a consequence of the loss of palatalization, the pronunciation of y and i merged. This change resulted in the diphthongization of √Ω > ej in Common Czech (the widespread Bohemian interdialect). There are also some other changes in this period: the diphthongization of √∫ > ou (written au, the pronunciation was probably different than today), the monophthongization of ie > √≠ (miera > m√≠ra 'measure') and uo > √∫. The diphthong uo was sometimes recorded as o in the form of a ring above the letter u, which resulted in the grapheme ≈Ø (kuo≈à > k≈Ø≈à). The ring has been regarded as a diacritic mark denoting the length since the change in pronunciation. The contrast of animateness in masculine inflection is not still fully set, as it is not yet applied to animals (vid√≠m p√°na 'I see a lord'; vid√≠m pes 'I see a dog'). Aorist and imperfect have disappeared from literary styles before the end of the 15th century. Early Modern Czech = Humanistic period = The period of the mature literary language from the 16th to the beginning of the 17th century. The orthography in written texts is not still unified, digraphs are used predominantly in various forms. After the invention of book-printing, the so-called Brethren orthography stabilized in printed documents. The Bible of Kralice (1579‚Äì1593), the first complete Czech translation of the Bible from the original languages by the Unity of the Brethren, became the pattern of the literary Czech language. The orthography was predominantly diacritic; the dot in soft consonants was replaced by the caron which was used in ƒç, ƒè, ≈à, ≈ô, ≈•, ≈æ. The letter ≈° was mostly written in the final positions in words only, the digraph  É É was written in the middle. The grapheme ƒõ became used in the contemporary way. Vowel length was denoted by the acute accent, except for ≈Ø developed from original uo. The long √≠ was doubled ii for technical reasons; later it was denoted as ij, and finally as j. Pronounced [j] was recorded as g or y, pronounced [g] was sometimes recorded by the grapheme «ß. The double w was preserved, the simple v denoted the word-initial u. The diphthong ou was denoted as au. The hard y was always written after c, s, z (cyz√Ω 'strange'). The complicated syntax, influenced by Latin texts, required some improvement of the punctuation. However, the comma was used according to pauses in pronunciation, not the syntax. The full stop, the colon, the question mark and the exclamation mark are used. The first grammars are published for typographers' purposes. In the pronunciation, the change of √Ω > ej was established, but it occurred in lesser prestige style text only. The diphthongization of √∫ > ou was also stabilized (but au still remained in graphics). In initial positions, it was used in lesser prestige or specialized styles only. Written mƒõ [mje] starts to be pronounced as [m≈àe]. The change of tautosyllabic aj > ej (daj > dej 'give (2. sg. imperative)', vajce > vejce 'egg') took place, but it was not applied in heterosyllabic aj (daj√≠ 'they will give', vajec 'egg (gen. pl.)'). In morphology, the differentiation of animate and inanimate masculines was completed (vid√≠m psa rather than the earlier vid√≠m pes). = Baroque period = The period from the second half of the 17th century to the second third of the 18th century was marked by confiscations and emigration of the Czech intelligentsia after the Battle of White Mountain. The function of the literary language was limited; it left the scientific field first, the discerning literature later, and the administration finally. Under the rule of Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II, who also reigned as king of Bohemia, the use of Czech was discouraged due to its association with Protestantism, and relegated to a spoken peasant tongue. However, puppeteers continued to use Czech for public marionette shows, and popular legend has it that this preserved the Czech language from extinction at home. Meanwhile, prestigious literary styles were cultivated by Czech expatriates abroad. The zenith and, simultaneously, the end of the florescence of prestigious literary styles are represented by the works of Jan Amos Komensk√Ω. The changes in the phonology and the morphology of the literary language ended in the previous period. Only the spoken language continued its development in the country. As a consequence of strong isolation, the differences between dialects were deepened. Especially, the Moravian and Silesian dialects developed divergently from Common Czech. Printed documents used the same orthography as in the previous period. Only the two kinds of l are not differentiated any more. The semicolon occurs as a punctuation mark for better and clear organization of excessive and complicated complex sentences. Digraphs with irregular elements of diacritics are still used in hand-written texts. The first ideas of the National Revival were in so-called defences of the Czech language. The most likely first such work is Dissertatio apologenetica pro lingua Slavonica, praecipue Bohemica (\\"The defence of the Slavic language, of Czech in particular\\"), written in Latin by Bohuslav Balb√≠n.  Modern Czech  Nuƒçice, dated 1822. Sample (1846) The period from the 1780s to the 1840s. The abolition of serfdom in 1781 (by Joseph II) caused migration of country inhabitants to towns. It enabled the implementation of the ideas of the Czech national awakeners for the renewal of the Czech language. However, the people's language and literary genres of the previous period were strange to the enlightened intelligentsia. The literary language of the end of the 16th century and of Komensk√Ω‚Äôs work became the starting point for the new codification of literary Czech. Of the various attempts at codification, Josef Dobrovsk√Ω‚Äôs grammar was ultimately generally accepted. Purists' attempts to cleanse the language of germanisms (both real and fictitious) had been occurring by that time. The publication of Josef Jungmann‚Äôs five-part Czech-German Dictionary (1830‚Äì1835) contributed to the renewal of Czech vocabulary. Thanks to the enthusiasm of Czech scientists, Czech scientific terminology was created. Step by step, the orthography was liberated from the relics of the Brethren orthography. According to the etymology, si, zi or sy, zy came to be written, cy was replaced by ci. Antiqua was introduced instead of fractura in printing, and it led to the removal of the digraph  É É and its replacement by the letter ≈°. The long √≠ replaced j, and j replaced g (gegj > jej√≠ 'hers'). In the 1840s, the double w was replaced by v and ou replaced the traditional au. Thus, the orthography became close to its contemporary appearance. According to the German model, the punctuation leaves the pause principle and respects the syntax. The artistic literature often resorted to archaisms and did not respect the natural development of the spoken language. This was due to attempts to reach the prestige literal styles. Literary Czech has not been an exclusive matter of the intellectual classes since the 1840s. Journalism was developing and artistic works got closer to the spoken language, especially in syntax. In 1902, Jan Gebauer published the first Rules of Czech Orthography, which also contained an overview of the morphology. These rules still preferred older forms in doublets. During the 20th century, elements of the spoken language (of Common Czech especially) penetrated literary Czech. The orthography of foreign words was changed to reflect their German pronunciation, especially writing z instead of s and marking the vowel length (e.g. gymnasium > gymn√°zium 'grammar school'). Social changes after World War II (1945) led to gradual diminishing of differences between dialects. Since the second half of the 20th century, Common Czech elements have also been spreading to regions previously unaffected, as a consequence of the media's influence.

In his art appear motives of futuristic landscapes and architecture, biomechanical surrealism and fantastic realism.Inspiration: Peter gric Gric is member of the art groups Libellule and Labyrinthe.Leoplaw: Peter Gric  Life  Petr Gric was born in 1968 in Brno, former Czechoslovakia. His parents supported his talent in painting and drawing, which he exhibited when he was young.Peter Gric#Info In 1980 his parents, under the pretense described as vacation travel, emigrated through Hungary and Yugoslavia to Austria, and Gric thenceforth lived in Western Europe. They spent one year in the countryside of Reichenau an der Rax. They soon moved to Linz where Gric finished primary school and studied graphic design at the H√∂here Technische Lehranstalt. In 1988 he moved to Vienna where he began to study under Arik Brauer at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna. He finished his studies with a Master of Fine Arts degree in 1993. While still in college, he participated in several exhibitions and started to sell his work successfully. In 1996, Gric presented his work about the connection of painting and computer graphics at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna. In 2009, he moved from Vienna to H√∂flein an der Hohen Wand.  Work  Painting Network IV (fragment), acrylic on canvas Working as an artist for a living, he creates new works irregularly. Before exhibiting, he works intensively, but often without creating anything for weeks and only experiments with graphic software and geometry for his new work. Smaller format works take him a few days or weeks to create. Large works take him months to finish. However, many of them are in progress for a very long time and only finished after several years. Some of his paintings are several meters in size.Peter Gric -Space-Warp Machine II = Techniques = Gric uses oil paint, acrylic paint, or combinations thereof. He also uses airbrushes. Most of his work he designs in graphic software and the more complex pieces, he models in 3D software.Interview with Peter Gric Despite his work in computer graphics, it is not his primary medium. = Motives = His art is a combination of futuristic landscapes and architecture, biomechanical surrealism and fantastic realism. Before his artistic career, he was influenced by science fiction illustrators Chris Moore, Peter Elson and by Star Wars movies. However, his biggest influence was surrealistic paintings by his father, and artists like Salvador Dal√≠, Giorgio de Chirico, Max Ernst, Ernst Fuchs, Rudolf Hausner, Samuel Bak, Alfred Kubin, Hans Ruedi Giger and later Zdzis≈Çaw Beksi≈Ñski, Odd Nerdrum and De Es Schwertberger. Most of his inspirations are from nature and architecture, but he is also fascinated by erosion, abstract geometry and women's bodies. Gric creates visions and fantasy that he himself can't explain. Like Beksi≈Ñski, he doesn't care about interpretations of his works. Gric declared about his art:  Exhibitions and collaboration  In 2007, he participated in the design of the stage for the SamPlay production Hamlet in Rock.SamPlay: B√ºhnenaufbauHamlet in Rock photos In 2010, he worked on the Concept Design for the project \\"At the Mountains of Madness\\" by director Guillermo del Toro.

His league debut came on 26 April 1997, when he scored the first goal in a 2‚Äì0 victory home over Oldham Athletic. Despite this impressive start, he found it difficult to establish himself and joined Kingstonian on loan in January 1998. In August 1998, out of favour at the start of the new season, he joined Slough Town on loan, scoring twice in 11 Isthmian League games. His debut goal for Reading turned out to be his only goal for the club, as he failed to find the net in four other starts, or 11 substitute appearances. In January 1999, Roach was told by Reading manager Tommy Burns that he was free to leave and began talks with Conference side Stevenage Borough. On 23 February 1999 he joined Wycombe Wanderers on loan, playing for their reserves the following day. This was to be his only appearance for Wycombe as on 26 February he joined Southend United on loan, with the move being made permanent on 3 March, costing the Shrimpers ¬£30,000. He made his Southend debut on 27 February in a 3‚Äì0 defeat away to Cambridge United and scored on his home debut on 6 March as Southend beat Swansea City 2‚Äì0.

Originally a spin-off company from the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, the company was founded in 2000 by Richard Friend, Henning Sirringhaus and Stuart Evans and specialised in polymer transistors and plastic electronics. In February 2015, the company announced that the technology development and manufacturing parts of Plastic Logic would be separated and would go forward as independent companies, in order to generate focus while addressing a range of opportunities available in identified markets. FlexEnable was created from Plastic Logic's people and its technology assets in Cambridge, UK. The manufacturing plant in Dresden, Germany, which develops, manufactures and sells a range of flexible EPD, operates independently under the name Plastic Logic Germany. Plastic Logic Germany's flexible plastic display Plastic Logic Germany in Dresden Plastic Logic opened the first mini-fabrication plant on November 11, 2003 in Cambridge, UK. A factory for the mass-production of the display units was opened on September 17, 2008 in Dresden, Germany. Plastic Logic announced its first plastic screen device on November 30, 2004, to be used by Siemens Communications in their mobile devices. This was followed by the announcement of an ereader called the QUE proReader. However, by August 2010, they had cancelled the QUE proReader. In September 2011 the company announced Plastic Logic 100 aimed to bring e-textbooks to Russian schools. In January 2011 the company received $280m in venture capital: $230m into the equity of Plastic Logic from Rusnano and $50m from Oak Investment Partners, a multi-stage venture capital firm. In May 2012 Plastic Logic revealed a ‚ÄòPlastic Inside‚Äô strategy ‚Äì selling its plastic back- planes, sensors and tags for customers to incorporate into other products. On May 17, 2012, Plastic Logic announced that they were abandoning plans to manufacture their own e-reader devices (focusing instead on licensing their existing technology), shutting down their US office in Mountain View, California, and reducing staff elsewhere. In July 2012, Plastic Logic demonstrated a flexible display that was 130 ¬µm thick, as well as the first flexible plastic display that can play colour video animation content at 12 frames per second (14 fps in black and white), driven by OTFTs (organic thin film transistors). Plastic Logic also demonstrated several product concepts including an ultra-thin e-paper companion device for a smartphone. The 10.7‚Äù touchscreen pane for viewing of webpages and documents was designed for easier reading of content than on the screen of a smartphone. BBC Click featured Plastic Logic's technology in a report on \\"going paperless\\" in July 2012.  Technology  Plastic Logic Germany licenses technology from FlexEnable Ltd's technology platform based on organic thin film transistors (OTFTs), enabling electronics to be manufactured on flexible or plastic sheets, to make flexible plastic electrophoretic displays (EPD) in a full range of sizes. These daylight readable displays are designed to be lightweight, thin and robust with low battery consumption. The company claims they have lifetimes of over five years and more than 10 million page updates. The same technology can also be used for non-display applications. One example is the world's first flexible image sensor on plastic, which was jointly developed by ISORG and Plastic Logic and showcased at LOPE-C in June 2013. In January 2013, the company won the FlexTech Alliance's \\"FLEXI 2013 R&D; Award\\" for innovation in flexible display manufacturing. This was in recognition for the development of a scalable manufacturing process for integrating a colour filter array on a flexible plastic display. Other companies recognised by the FlexTech Alliance included Corning, Inc. and American Semiconductor.  Flexible displays Plastic Logic Germany develops and manufactures flexible plastic displays for third party end-devices. Because the displays are made of plastic, they are resistant to breaking and are designed for use in robust mobile devices. In March 2013, the readers of the German electronic products magazine Elektronik voted Plastic Logic's flexible colour display \\"Optoelectronic Product of the Year 2013\\". At the International CES in Las Vegas at the beginning of January 2013, the company announced the tablet computer product PaperTab, the result of a collaboration between Intel, Plastic Logic and the Human Media Lab of Queen's University (Ontario, Canada). Powered by an Intel Core i5 Processor, the PaperTab incorporates a flexible 10.7‚Äù plastic display developed and manufactured by Plastic Logic. The interface is gesture-controlled, allowing the user to change a view or action a command by bending a screen corner or tapping one screen on another. Multiple PaperTabs can be used to display data side-by-side as a virtual desktop, displaying media such as emails and larger images simultaneously. Plastic Logic Germany also supplies larger displays, which can be used as e-paper or a companion device for a smartphone. Further uses include enabling a large form-factor, flexible and lightweight eReader. In March 2013 Toppan Printing Co., Ltd and Plastic Logic demonstrated the first large-area, flexible electrophoretic digital signage prototype at RETAILTECH in Tokyo, Japan. The 42\\" prototype consisted of 16 10.7\\" Plastic Logic monochrome flexible plastic displays, tiled together, in a 4x4 configuration for use in applications with close viewing distances. The power consumption of the displays was also demonstrated for disaster-ready applications in areas prone to natural disasters, such as the post-earthquake society of Japan. Plastic Logic Germany has also shown concept designs enabled by its smaller displays, such as wearable computers for use in sports, health and medical applications.  The QUE proReader  The QUE proReader was a first generation e-reader product from Plastic Logic. The final version of the product was presented during a public event at CES January 2010. The product was cancelled on August 2010 without ever shipping, with the firm noting that \\"We recognize the market has dramatically changed, and with the product delays we have experienced, it no longer make sense for us to move forward with our first generation electronic reading product.\\"  Plastic Logic 100  Plastic Logic 100 was an \\"electronic textbook\\" which was intended for educational use. Its availability was announced by Plastic Logic on September 12, 2011. Beginning later that month, a shipment of devices was scheduled to be used on a trial basis in selected schools in Russia which were planning to be pioneering the electronic textbook program. The Plastic Logic 100 used plastic-based e-paper technology. The device employed a 10.7\\" glare-free, shatterproof, and anti-fingerprint display, as well as a touch-based UI. The storage limit was 4 GB and the device was running Windows CE on an 800 MHz processor. The battery was intended to last a week under regular use, which includes reading, underlining, and annotation of text. Due to the company's strategy change, announced in May 2012, the device was discontinued.

The inconspicuous alley remained nameless until the 20th century; it is included on a map from 1700, but completely left out on another dated 1733. The present name was given to the alley in 1939, presumably inspired by the two parallel alleys, both of which are named after men who served King Gustav Vasa (1496‚Äì1560) during the ousting of Danish forces. Peder Fredag (‚Äì1525) was probably one of the burghers of Stockholm, who first appeared in historical records in 1520 when, confronted with Christian II of Denmark, he vehemently opposed the city's terms of surrender. Before the Danes marched into the city, he escaped to the north of Sweden where he began to amass people to revolt against the Danish king. He started to raid the Stockholm Archipelago with his yacht, and in 1521 he joined the party of Gustav Vasa who eventually gave him a letter of marque. During the seizure of the capital, Peder Fredag was appointed captain in charge of the camp at Lov√∂n, and as such he repelled an attack from the besieged city during Christmas 1521 and another against the King's camp on S√∂dermalm in autumn 1522. Following the king's glorious march into the city, Peder Fredag was richly rewarded with marks of honour and tokens of grace, but he eventually died on the battlefield in 1525 during an assault against the city of Kalmar, besieged by the mercenary troops of Berend von Melen.

In 2005, then-Federal Education Minister Brendan Nelson raised the prospect of teaching intelligent design in science classes, but quickly retreated to declare that religion or philosophy classes would be the only appropriate venue. The Australian chapter of Campus Crusade for Christ distributed a DVD of the Discovery Institute's documentary Unlocking the Mystery of Life (2002) to Australian secondary schools. Prominent scientific and educational organisations including the Australian Academy of Science, the Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies, and the Australian Science Teachers' Association published an open letter urging that \\"the teaching or promulgation of intelligent design as science\\" should be prohibited, and that allowing such materials into school classrooms \\"would make a mockery of Australian science teaching and throw open the door of science classes to similarly unscientific world views - be they astrology, spoon bending, flat Earth cosmology or alien abductions.\\" Within a week of this open letter being published, Hawkes declared his support for using the DVD in the classroom at the discretion of teachers and principals, stating that are undeniable weaknesses within Darwin's Theory of Evolution, and these must be acknowledged honestly\\"; he added that the DVD being \\"forever shackled\\" and restricted to only the context of religious education would be a shame as teachers should be able to use it in science classes and other areas where theories and their underlying scientific assumptions are explored. The debate on intelligent design resulted in Hawkes being nominated for the Bent Spoon Award of the Australian Skeptics organisation in 2006; Nelson had been nominated 17 times when the organisation decided not to accept any further nominations for him. Neither of them won the award. In 2007, Hawkes was given a \\"quality teaching\\" federal government award for excellence as a school principal for \\"rejuvenating the educational philosophy and practice of The King's School by building on its strengths as a national leader in boys' education, residential education and leadership education.

Avinoff was the Director of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History for 20 years from 1926 to 1946. He established himself as one of the world's greatest butterfly collectors and is also well known for his paintings. Biography Avinoff was born in Tulchyn, Podolia Governorate, now Ukraine, to a wealthy Russian family with ties to nobility who served a diplomatic role in the Nicholas II of Russia's court. Avinoff learned to speak English fluently during his childhood. He left Russia after the Revolution and moved to America. In 1924, he was hired as an assistant curator of entomology at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. He was promoted to director in 1926, a position he held until 1946. He was also appointed a trustee of the museum. In 1927 he was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Science from the University of Pittsburgh. His associates at the Carnegie Museum included William P. Comstock, E. Irving Huntington, Cyril F. dos Passos and Vladimir Nabokov. Personal life Avinoff generally lived a secluded upper-class life in Pittsburgh, a popular and thriving metropolis with a strong elitist society at the time. A homosexual, Avinoff never had children. Later in life, suffering from health conditions, he moved to New York where he resumed his interest in painting, and the New Yorker profiled him in a 12-page article about his life. At his death, he had created hundreds of paintings which are largely sought after by collectors today. Avinoff was close friends with the biologist and sex researcher Alfred Kinsey, largely due to their similar interest in insects from Kinsey's work with gall wasps. Butterflies While in Europe, Avinoff spent his spare time traveling throughout the mountainous areas in Europe and Asia collecting butterflies. Avinoff would trace their genetic evolution through different valleys, since the mountains separating those valleys prevented different butterflies from mating. He found the Himalayas to be the ultimate proving ground. Avinoff's collection of Rhopalocera from the Pamir Mountains and Central Asia currently resides in the Zoological Museum in St. Petersburg. This collection of some eighty thousand specimens was appropriated by the Soviet government. Following World War II, the Mellon family asked to retrieve the collection, but this was refused. Once in the US, through trading and purchase and through financing of expeditions, Avinoff managed to build up a near duplicate collection, most of which was donated to the Carnegie Museum. Much of his work still exists at the Carnegie Museum and at the Museum of Natural History in New York. Avinoff also made six trips to Jamaica, which he described as \\"a dreamland of tropical splendor\\", between 1926 and 1940. A year prior, Avinoff joined Entomological Society of America. Accompanying him on five of those trips was Nicholas Shoumatoff, the son of his sister Elizabeth Shoumatoff, for whom Avinoff served as a father figure. The two caught more than fourteen thousand bots (butterflies and moths in Jamaican patois), doubling the number of known species on the island to more than a thousand. Painting Later in his life, unable to travel from his health conditions, he moved to New York and resumed an interest from earlier in his life in painting. He was also the brother of the famous portrait painter Elizabeth Shoumatoff, who is most famous for painting Frankin Delano Roosevelt at the moment when he collapsed and died. Avinoff's paintings were highly skilled images of flora or fauna, or paintings with deep meanings with themes of religious, sexual, apocalyptic nature, or combinations of the three. He worked in a wide variety of mediums from precise pencil and ink drawings to oil to watercolor. One of his most famous series of paintings depict The Fall of Atlantis, a poem by George V. Golokhvastoff published in limited edition in 1938. The Birth of Atlantis, illustrated in his series of paintings, exemplifies the Art Deco style popular in the 1930s. The image is of a young male figure rising out of the sea, symbolic of the legendary island said by Plato to have later disappeared beneath the waves during an earthquake. His paintings of flowers, and 350 of his works illustrate Wildflowers of Western Pennsylvania and the Upper Ohio Basin. Selected publications *1946, with N.

She earned three battle stars during World War II. Skylark was mined and sunk off Okinawa in April 1945. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register the same day.  Career  Skylark was laid down on 9 July 1941 by the General Engineering & Dry Dock Company of Alameda, California; launched on 12 March 1942; sponsored by Mrs. William L. Simpson; and commissioned on 25 November 1942. After almost a month of trials, calibrations, and training along the coast of California, Skylark got underway for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on the morning of 20 December. The convoy arrived in Pearl Harbor ten days later, and Skylark remained in the Islands for another eleven days. On 10 January 1943, she stood out of Pearl Harbor and set course for Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides, escorting another convoy. For the next year, Skylark escorted convoys around the various island groups in the South Pacific, the New Hebrides, Samoa, New Caledonia, and the Solomons, the conquest of which she was supporting. Often she shepherded supply echelons to Guadalcanal and to some of the other islands in the group, then would patrol the area for a week or two. Of all the months of that year, June 1943 was her most active. On the 16th, while she was screening ships off Guadalcanal, she came under aerial attack by Japanese dive bombers and assisted in splashing four of the intruders. A week later, on 23 June, two ships of her convoy, and were torpedoed by a Japanese submarine, . Skylark succeeded in rescuing 193 survivors and carried them on to Espiritu Santo. In January 1944, the minesweeper began an extended period of convoy-escort and patrol duty in the Solomons. Until 15 April, her theater of operations was restricted to those islands alone as she herded the supply echelons between them. On 15 April, she departed the Solomons for Espiritu Santo, arriving there the next day. On 7 May, she began her return voyage to the Solomons; and, two days later, she put into Purvis Bay, Florida Island, for repairs. Repairs and minesweeping exercises occupied her time until 3 June, when she sailed from Purvis Bay with elements of Task Force 53, bound for Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshalls. The various elements of the task force rendezvoused at Kwajalein on the 8th, refueled, and departed on the 12th. The Southern Attack Force, otherwise known as task force TF 53, was assigned the job of retaking Guam during the Marianas operation. Originally, the Guam assault was to have come several days after that upon Saipan. However, the necessity of meeting and defeating the Japanese fleet in what was to be the Battle of the Philippine Sea and the determination that additional troops would be needed to conquer Guam caused the assault to be delayed. Thus, TF 53 steamed around in the ocean east of Saipan until 25 June when Admiral Spruance ordered the bulk of it to Eniwetok to await the lifting of additional forces from Hawaii. Skylark arrived in Eniwetok Lagoon three days later. She remained at Eniwetok until 17 July at which time the task force departed for Guam. Arriving off Apra Harbor on 21 July, Skylark took up her screening station and, for almost two months, screened ships and patrolled in the vicinity of Apra. On 9 September, Skylark ceased patrolling and screening and departed Guam in the escort of an Eniwetok-bound convoy. She arrived on 14 September and entered an availability period until 3 October. From Eniwetok, she moved to Ulithi, arriving on 9 October and departing again on 17 September to escort the repair ship back to Eniwetok. The two ships made Eniwetok on 23 October, and Skylark departed the next day. After a two-day layover at Majuro, 26 to 28 October, she headed for Pearl Harbor. From Pearl Harbor, she continued on to California, where she underwent repairs at both the Stockton Ship Works at Stockton, California, and General Engineering & Dry Dock Co., at Alameda, California. On 15 February 1945, Skylark pointed her bow westward again and sailed out of Alameda. She entered Pearl Harbor on 22 February, provisioned the next day, and headed back to Eniwetok on 24 February. A month later, Skylark was with the other minesweepers clearing the invasion areas around Okinawa. At 10:55 on 28 March, while sweeping a minefield off the Hagushi beaches, she struck a mine on her port side amidships. Skylark drifted while the crew fought fires and tried to save her. Twenty minutes later, she struck a second mine, took a heavy list, and sank within fifteen minutes. Five men were killed by the two explosions and, thanks to the rescue work of the destroyer minelayer , these were her only losses. Skylark was struck from the Navy list on 28 April 1945. Skylark earned three battle stars for World War II service.

Choucoune One of Oswald Durand's most famous works, the 1883 Choucoune is a lyrical poem that praises the beauty of a Haitian woman of that nickname. Michel Maul√©art Monton, an American-born pianist with a Haitian father and American mother composed music for the poem in 1893, appropriating some French and Caribbean fragments to create his tune. The song \\"Choucoune\\" was first performed in Port-au-Prince on 14 May 1893. It became a popular m√©ringue lente (slow m√©ringue) in Haiti, and was played prominently during the bicentennial celebrations in Port-au-Prince in 1949. Choucoune was recorded by \\"Katherine Dunham and her Ensemble\\" for the Decca album Afro- Caribbean Songs and Rhythms released in 1946 (with the title spelled as Choucounne), and was first recorded in Haiti by Emerante (Emy) de Pradines for her Voodoo - Authentic Music of Haiti album (Remington R-199-151) released in the US in 1953.

Versions =Yellow Bird= The English rendering of \\"Choucoune\\", \\"Yellow Bird\\", first appeared on the album Calypso Holiday, a 1957 release by the Norman Luboff Choir, with Luboff having arranged the song in the calypso style that become popular in the English-speaking world in the mid-1950s. The lyrics for \\"Yellow Bird\\", by Alan and Marilyn Bergman, have no connection with the narrative of the Durand poem‚Äîother than the poem features the words \\"ti zwazo\\" (little bird) in its refrain, and so the original Haitian song is sometimes called \\"Ti Zwazo\\" or \\"Ti Zwezo\\". The song became a minor hit at number 70 on the Billboard Hot 100 for the Mills Brothers in 1959. Its most successful incarnation came in the summer of 1961 when the Arthur Lyman Group reached number four on the Billboard Hot 100 and number two on the newly formed Easy Listening chart with their Hawaiian flavored instrumental version, which bested a rival instrumental single release by Lawrence Welk (number 61). Several versions of \\"Yellow Bird\\" were recorded and released in Jamaica around the late 1950s/1960s. Jamaican mento/calypso singers renditions include Lord Jellicoe (Hilary ILP-1040), Keith Stewart (WIRL 1031), Count Frank (WIRL 1058), Roy Fuller (Tiger 002/Dynamic 3312), Archie Lewis (Federal 213) and The Joy Makers (Somb, 1976). \\"Yellow Bird\\" has also been recorded by Keely Smith, Roger Whitaker, Davy Graham, Roger Williams, Johnny Tillotson, The Brothers Four, Gary Crosby, Lawrence Welk, and Paul Clayton. The song continues to be popularly associated with calypso and the Caribbean, and is often performed by steelpan bands‚Äîbut some versions, such as Chris Isaak's from Baja Sessions, show a Hawaiian flavor. In 1970, Fairport Convention recorded the song for their album Live at the L.A. Troubadour. Popular culture Vivian Vance sang \\"Yellow Bird\\" on a two-part Here's Lucy episode, Lucy Goes Hawaiian, which aired February 15 and Feb. 22, 1971. Vance sang it in a high falsetto, with a calypso beat‚Äîdressed in yellow with feathers like a canary (including a long tail feather)‚Äîand perched on a swing decorated as a nest. The 23 October 1989 broadcast of the CBS TV series Murphy Brown entitled Miles' Big Adventure ends with guest star Yeardley Smith serenading her unwilling object of desire Miles Silverberg with a snippet of \\"Yellow Bird\\". A Portuguese percussion band plays the song in a Full House episode, The House Meets the House - Part 2 at Walt Disney World while Michelle Tanner dances. The Wiggles sing this song on their Let's Eat album and DVD. \\"To Bowl or Not To Bowl\\", an episode of The Looney Tunes Show that first aired on July 27, 2011, featured an uptempo, ska- like version of \\"Yellow Bird\\" during the Merrie Melodies song segment of the same name performed by Holland Greco. The song appears in the 2012 Australian movie The Sapphires and on the soundtrack album. In the Monty Python sketch \\"Spot The Loony\\", one of the characters is named \\"Miles Yellowbird, up high in banana tree\\". The name quotes the opening words of the Bergman lyrics. =Don't Ever Love Me= Harry Belafonte had a 1957 single release entitled \\"Don't Ever Love Me\\" that set different English lyrics (written by Lord Burgess to Michel Mauleart Monton's setting for \\"Choucune\\"), initially the B-side of \\"Mama Look at Bubu\\" (number 11), \\"Don't Ever Love Me\\" itself entered the Billboard Hot 100 at number 90.

In this way, the overall reaction for the decomposition of ozone is catalyzed by chlorine, as ultimately chlorine remains unchanged. The overall reaction is: O.+\\\\; O3 \\\\to 2O2 This has been a significant impact of the use of CFCs on the upper stratosphere, however many countries have agreed to ban the use of CFCs. The nonreactive nature of CFC's allows them to pass into the stratosphere, where they undergo photo-dissociation to form Cl radicals. These then readily form chlorine monoxide, and this cycle can continue until two radicals react to form dichlorine monoxide, terminating the radical reaction. Because the concentration of CFCs in atmosphere is very low, the probability of a terminating reaction is exceedingly low, meaning each radical can decompose many thousands of molecules of ozone. Even though the use of CFCs was banned in many countries, CFCs can stay in the atmosphere for about 50-500 years. This cause many chlorine radicals to be produced and hence a significant amount of ozone molecules are decomposed before the chlorine radicals are able to react with chlorine monoxide to form Dichlorine monoxide.

His music includes art songs, musical theatre, solo instrumental works, choral music, electroacoustic installations, and music for film and church, and has been performed throughout North America and Europe. The judges who awarded him a BMI Student Composer Award described his winning work as ‚Äúa dramatic and strikingly beautiful example of choral writing which speaks to the heart as well as to the mind.‚Äù He has collaborated with musical and non-musical artists, including Tony Award-winning playwrights, Emmy-winning filmmakers, and prize-winning poets. Early life and education Perkins was born in New Britain, Connecticut, on June 25, 1980, to Catherine and Henry Perkins. He moved to Bristol, Connecticut, three years later. He began composing at the age of five; a year later, one of his pieces was performed on the carillon bells at Trinity College, in Hartford, CT. He studied composition at the Hartt School at age twelve, and won his first competition at 14; his winning work was performed by the Hartford Symphony Orchestra. Perkins was an active participant and, later, a leader in his middle- and high-school music programs, and was selected as a member of regional, and All-State bands and choirs as an alto saxophonist and a baritone singer. He graduated from Bristol Central High School in 1998. Perkins studied music theory and composition with Martin Amlin, Richard Cornell, Charles Fussell, and Marjorie Merryman at the Boston University College of Fine Arts. He minored in vocal performance; his voice teachers were William Hite and Joy McIntyre. He won several departmental awards and prizes, and he graduated with highest honors in 2002. He then pursued graduate studies in music theory pedagogy at the Eastman School of Music, earning a Master of Arts degree in 2004. He began a double-degree Ph.D. in music theory and composition but eventually elected to complete his degree in only composition with minors in music theory and music history. During his studies, he earned a second master's degree in music theory. His primary composition teacher was Ricardo Zohn-Muldoon, and his dissertation was advised by Zohn-Muldoon, William Marvin, and David Liptak. His dissertation comprised ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Revolt of the Angels‚Äô‚Äô (a six-movement work for organ, electric violin, and orchestra) and a thesis on the influence of Benjamin Britten‚Äôs ‚Äò‚ÄôMissa Brevis in D‚Äô‚Äô on his ‚Äò‚ÄôWar Requiem‚Äô‚Äô. An early version of his thesis was named the best student paper presented at an American Musicological Society chapter meeting. Career While at Eastman, Perkins served on the faculty of Nazareth College; he also taught courses at Eastman. He concertized as a tenor throughout the country and abroad, gave presentations on musical topics at Harvard University and the University of Chicago, directed choral ensembles, and co-founded the music organization Encore Music Creations. He moved to New Haven, Connecticut in 2010 and concentrated on writing music for the church and for theatre. His sacred choral music is performed throughout the United States and is published by Augsburg Fortress. In 2011, he scored Sir Peter Shaffer‚Äôs play, ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Gift of the Gorgon‚Äô‚Äô in collaboration with the playwright. The play was performed at Guild Hall in East Hampton, New York, starring Alec Baldwin and directed by Tony Walton. His short opera \\"Charon,\\" written with librettist Nat Cassidy, was commissioned by the Washington National Opera as part of its inaugural American Opera Initiative. It was premiered on November 19, 2012, at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., and received strong reviews: Philip Kennicott of the Washington Post wrote, ‚Äú‚ÄòCharon‚Äô. . . works effectively because it establishes and maintains a single mood, intensifying to a dramatic conclusion. Melodic vocal fragments are set against more dissonant but colorful sounds in the instrumental ensemble.‚Äù Terry Ponick, writing for the Washington Times Communities praised Perkins for having ‚Äúperfectly orchestrated‚Äù the ‚Äúhaunting music,‚Äù and he applauded Perkins and Cassidy for having created a work that makes a ‚Äúvisceral connection to [our] own times.‚Äù In the fall of 2012, Perkins was appointed Assistant Professor of Music at DePauw University, where he taught courses in composition, music theory, and musicianship until 2015.

Cronshaw works exclusively in natural materials‚Äîwood, stone, fruit, bone‚Äîand casts them in bronze. His work is usually representative, but attempts to maintain the innate characteristics of the original material.  Beginnings  Cronshaw was born near Blackburn, Lancashire, but brought up in the rural Pendle district, near a hill named Cronshaw's Seat. The farm was sold in 1997 although Cronshaw no longer lived there at that time. At present he lives in the West Riding town of Todmorden, in the Calderdale metropolitan district. His career as a sculptor began while he was living at Hebden Bridge. Blackburn was Cronshaw's childhood home; he did a foundation course at Blackburn College. From there he went on to the Leeds School of Art and finished his BA at Saint Martin's School of Art in 1984. In the years 1985 to 1986, Cronshaw studied for an MA in fine art at the Royal College of Art.  Exhibitions and major works  Cronshaw's work has been displayed at galleries and exhibitions including the Rebecca Hossack gallery (London), the Caz gallery (Los Angeles), the Henry Moore Gallery (Leeds), the Royal Academy Summer Show, the Los Angeles International Contemporary Art Fair, the Liverpool Garden Festival and the Third World and Beyond International Art Fair in Sicily. Cronshaw was commissioned to create sculptures for Liverpool City Council and for the Boots PLC head office in Nottingham. The latter was a statue of the earth goddess Gaia, Gaia's body clothed in 3,000 succulent plants intended to suggest the transitory nature of life. The statue was cast by means of the lost wax method at Cronshaw's studio/foundry at the Dean Clough complex in Halifax, Calderdale. The sculpture created for Liverpool City Council was named 'The Great Escape' by Cronshaw. It is a bronze horse, high and 4 tons in weight, formed entirely from rope in a spaghetti fashion. At the tail a piece of rope extends to the ground where a life-size sculpture of a man steps on it, forcing the horse to rear and apparently unravel itself. Currently Cronshaw is continuing to work on his popular Midas Project of bronze succulent plants, as well as initiating a campaign to improve the environment of his adopted home of Todmorden by placing sculptures in and around the town centre.

He is the boar- or swine-god of the continental Celtic tribe of Lingones. Moccus was invoked as the protector of boar hunters and warriors. Boar meat was sacred among the ancient Celts, and features in accounts of feasts in Irish mythology. The Lingones, whose tribal center was at modern-day Langres, were a Gaulish tribe located in the area of the rivers Seine and Marne in what is now northeastern France. They were neighbors to the Celto-Germanic tribe of Treveri. Another tribe known as Lingones was located near the mouth of the Po River in northeastern Italy, and were known for agriculture, weaving and metalworking. There was a dedicated feast day to Moccus. He had a following in the Romano-Celtic period. Historical attestation The theonym Moccus is known from a single votive inscription from Langres, which reads as follows: The name is derived from the Gaulish moccos 'pig' or 'wild boar', cognate with Old Irish mucc, Welsh moch, and Breton moc'h, all with similar meanings. The same root also appears in the personal names of a number of individuals in Gaul in such forms as Moccius, Moccia, Mocconius, Catomocus, etc. Celtic god of Euffigneix Scholars such as √âmile Th√©venot and Philippe Jou√´t have connected Moccus with the god of Euffigneix, a Celtic sculpture depicting a torc-wearing god with a wild boar vertically over his torso. Th√©venot points out that Euffigneix would have lain in the same tribal territory‚Äîthat of the Lingones‚Äîas did Langres, where the Moccus inscription was found. In The Religion of the Ancient Celts (1911), J. A. MacCulloch noted that \\"the swine was a frequent representative of the barleycorn-spirit or of vegetation divinities in Europe\\" and that \\"the flesh of the animal was often mixed with the seed corn or buried in the fields to promote fertility\\". MacCulloch speculates that it was Moccus' role as a fertility god that led to his being identified with Mercury, whose Greek equivalent Hermes was associated with \\"fertility in flocks and herds\\". Jou√´t connects Moccus with the Irish myth in Oidheadh Chlainne Tuireann, in which Lugh obtains the pig-skin of Tuis, which could heal any injury. Lugh is widely considered to be the Irish form of the Celtic god Lugus, an analogue of the Gaulish Mercury.Lugus: The Gaulish Mercury at Mabinogion.info. The pig in ancient Celtic religion MacCulloch highlights the high status and prestige enjoyed by pigs or boars in Celtic cultures, including in religious and mythological contexts: Wild boar motif on a Gaulish coin from present-day Brittany Miranda Green considers the boar in Celtic religious contexts to represent both \\"war, because of their ferocity and indominability\\", and \\"prosperity, because pork was a favourite Celtic food and played an important part in feasting\\". Celtic warriors sported boar motifs on their helmets, standards, and carnyxes. Modern worship Moccus is worshipped in modern times by a few groups of Druids, Wiccan and Celtic polytheists. He is one of the main temple Gods worshiped by members of The Shrine of the Irish Oak Inc who have assigned his feast day to the winter solstice due to his aspects as a protector, sun god, and giver of plenty.
