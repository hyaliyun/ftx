Situated in the Yellow River valley. It offers exhibits of the rich cultural heritage of Luoyang, a major Chinese cultural centre, which was the capital of numerous Chinese dynasties including the Eastern Zhou and the Eastern Han. The museum was first built in 1958, in Guanlin, south of Luoyang City. It was moved to the north side of Zhongzhou Road in 1973 near the Wangcheng Park, which, at an area of , is the largest public park in Luoyang. The new museum opened on May 1, 1974. It houses relics from excavation sites on the outskirts of Luoyang, in the city's old section. They include antiquaries from palaces and temples. These artifacts establish the historical past of Luoyang, representing elements of the ancient city of nine capitals, from Neolithic times up to 937 AD. Architecture and fittings The museum is built in ancient Tang Dynasty, Chinese architectural style. An Eastern Han Dynasty painting of the \\"hundred-flower\\" lantern is displayed on the front facade of the museum.

Nauruan common law is founded mainly on statute law enacted by the Parliament of Nauru, and on precedents set by judicial interpretations of statutes, customs and prior precedents. Sources Nauruan law comprises a \\"number of Ordinances from the pre- independence administration which are still in force; certain laws of the United Kingdom, Papua New Guinea and Australia which have been adopted by Nauru and are still in force; Acts of Parliament passed since independence in 1968; Regulations; precedents of the Supreme Court of Nauru; and customary law\\".\\"Consolidation of Legislation Project\\", Parliament of Nauru Article 85 of the Constitution stipulates that law in existence at the time of independence continues to be applied until amended or repealed by Parliament.Constitution of Nauru Constitution The Constitution of Nauru, adopted in 1968, establishes itself as the supreme law of the country, and provides for the voiding of any statute inconsistent with it (art.2). Art.54(1) grants to the Supreme Court \\"original jurisdiction to determine any question arising under or involving the interpretation or effect of any provision of th[e] Constitution\\". Statutes Since 12 May 2016 Nauru has a new modern Criminal Code called the Crimes Act 2016, that reforms various crimes and other legislation. The Nauru Crimes Act 2016 also repeals the Queensland Criminal Code of 1899, that the Parliament of Nauru adopted into law (at the time of the independence of Nauru) since 1968. In addition to British and Australian statutes, and certain regulations applied to Papua New Guinea by Australia during the colonial period, the Parliament of Nauru is the law-making body for Nauru. The law-making process is derived from the legislative process of the British and Australian Parliaments, somewhat simplified as Nauru's Parliament is unicameral. Unlike the United Kingdom or Australia, however, the enactment of laws in Nauru does not require the assent of the head of State. A bill is enacted when it has been passed by Parliament, and certified as such by the Speaker.\\"How does Parliament make laws?\\", Parliament of Nauru Common law and equity The Constitution makes no reference to common law. However, article 4 of the Custom and Adopted Laws Act 1971 stipulates that \\"the common law and the statutes of general application [...] which were in force in England on the thirty-first day of January, 1968, are hereby adopted as laws of Nauru\\"; that \\"[t]he principles and rules of equity which were in force in England on the thirty-first day of January, 1968, are hereby adopted as the principles and rules of equity in Nauru\\"; and that \\"in every civil cause or matter instituted in any Court law and equity shall be administered concurrently\\". Art.5 specifies that English common law applies only insofar as it is \\"not repugnant to or inconsistent with the provisions\\" of any statute law applied in Nauru.Custom and Adopted Laws Act 1971 Case law In addition to applicable case law inherited from England and Australia, Nauruan case law is primarily based on precedents set in the Supreme Court. Due to the country's small size, Nauru has simply one District Court, with appeals heard by the Supreme Court. Appeals may be heard from the Supreme Court to the High Court of Australia on all but constitutional matters, enabling Australian High Court precedents to continue entering Nauruan jurisprudence. Additionally, a Family Court operates separately.\\"Nauru Courts System Information\\", Pacific Islands Legal Information Institute Nauru's Supreme Court has ruled on the following constitutional cases:Selected case law of the Supreme Court of Nauru, Pacific Islands Legal Information Institute * In re the Constitution, Jeremiah v Nauru Local Government Council (1971). Held by Chief Justice Ian Thompson: Article 3 of the Constitution guarantees the \\"fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual\\" exclusively within the bounds of the rights explicitly set out in articles 4 to 13. There is no constitutional right to marriage, and marriage may therefore be restricted by statute. * In re the Constitution of Nauru (1971). Held by Chief Justice Ian Thompson: Any statute restricting the right of Nauruans aged 20 or more to vote in legislative elections is void due to inconsistency with art.29 of the Constitution, which provides that \\"Members of Parliament shall be elected in such manner as is prescribed by law, by Nauruan citizens who have attained the age of twenty years\\". Nauruans may not be deprived of the right to vote on the grounds of unsoundness of mind, nor due to being in gaol. * Three Questions Referred under Articles 36 & 55 of the Constitution (1977). Held by Chief Justice Ian Thompson: Article 32(b) of the Constitution should be interpreted as meaning that any Member of Parliament convicted of an offence punishable by a year or more in gaol vacates his or her seat in Parliament immediately upon conviction, any appeal notwithstanding. * Four Questions Referred under Article 55 of the Constitution (1977). Held by Chief Justice Ian Thompson: Article 61 of the Constitution \\"is not intended to exclude the presentation of Bills for supply otherwise than in accordance with [the procedure it sets out for the withdrawal of moneys from the Treasury], if their presentation is otherwise expressly or implicitly authorised by the Constitution\\". The Supply Act 1977 is not unconstitutional. * In the Matter of the detention of Uti Siose under Article 5 of the Constitution of Nauru (1982). Held by Chief Justice Ian Thompson: The Criminal Procedure Act 1972 was unconstitutional insofar as it permitted the arrest of a person absconding from bail. Art. 5 of the Constitution provides that \\"No person shall be deprived of his personal liberty, except [...] (c) upon reasonable suspicion of his having committed, or being about to commit, an, offence\\"; absconding from bail was not yet an offence at the time of the case. * the Matter of Article 36 of the Constitution, Reference to the Supreme Court by Bobby Eoe (1988), a case arising under art.36 (\\"Any question that arises concerning the right of a person to be or to remain a member of Parliament shall be referred to and determined by the Supreme Court\\"). Held by Chief Justice Donne: Parliament's declaration of vacancy of one of its seats is, in this case, valid in accordance with art.32 of the Constitution. * Constitutional Reference; In re Article 55 of the Constitution (2003). In accordance with art.55 of the Constitution, which permits the Cabinet to refer a constitutional question to the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Barry Connell held that the Speaker's declaration of a successful parliamentary motion of no confidence against the Cabinet was invalid as it had not met the constitutional requirements for such a motion. * Constitutional Reference; In re Dual Nationality and Other Questions (2004). Question referred to the Supreme Court by Cabinet in accordance with art.55. Held by Chief Justice Barry Connell: \\"There is no direct prohibition on a member of Parliament holding dual citizenship.\\" * In the Matter of Article 55 & 45 (and Article 36 & 40) of the Constitution (2007). Chief Justice Robin Millhouse QC answered questions submitted by Cabinet (in accordance with art.55) on the meaning of articles 36, 40 and 45 of the Constitution. * In the Matter of Article 55 & 45 (and Article 36 & 40) of the Constitution (2008). Similar to the above. Answered by Millhouse CJ. * In re Article 36 of the National Constitution (2008). Held by Chief Justice Robin Millhouse QC: The Speaker must consult the Supreme Court before declaring a seat in Parliament vacant. * In the Matter of the Constitution and in the Matter of the Dissolution of the Eighteenth Parliament (2010). Held by Justice John von Doussa: The Constitution provides the President with full latitude to determine whether a state of emergency should be declared. Custom The Constitution makes no reference to custom. However, the Custom and Adopted Laws Act 1971 provides that the \\"institutions, customs and usages of the [indigenous] Nauruans\\" existing prior to the commencement of the Act shall have \\"full force and effect of law\\" to regulate certain issues of land ownership, other issues of property and inheritance, and more generally \\"any matters affecting [indigenous] Nauruans only\\". A custom is invalid to the extent that it would deprive a person of his or her property without his or her consent, or that it would \\"deprive the parents of a child of its custody and control without their consent\\". A custom may be \\"expressly, or by necessary implication, abolished, altered or limited by any law enacted by Parliament\\"; statute law prevails over custom. Reform In January 2011, Mathew Batsiua, Minister for Health, Justice and Sports, addressed the United Nations Human Rights Council within the context of Nauru's Universal Periodic Review. Summarising Nauru's report to the Council, he stated that the country was undergoing legal reforms with an aim to improve guarantees on human rights. He drew the Council's attention, in particular, to the Nauruan constitutional referendum of 2010, which had aimed unsuccessfully to amend the Constitution and expand its Bill of Rights. Batsiua stated: \\"Had the referendum received the required support, the constitutionally guaranteed rights and freedoms of the people of Nauru would have been something that all nations of the world might have aspired to. It would have been the first Constitution in the world to protect the rights of disabled persons, and the second in the region, after Papua New Guinea, to provide for the protection of environmental rights. It would have prohibited the death penalty, guaranteed the rights of children, recognised the right to receive education and health. It would have enshrined the right to receive maternity leave, and introduced a right to access information, among other things.\\" In addition, he stated Parliament was considering institutional and legal reforms to create the office of an ombudsman, and review Nauru's criminal code, \\"much of which remains unchanged since [...] 1899\\". The decriminalisation of \\"homosexual activity between consenting adults\\" was \\"under active consideration\\".[rtsp://webcast.un.org/ondemand/conferences/unhrc/upr/10th/hrc110124am1-eng.rm?start=00:04:37&end;=00:23:22 Address by Mathew Batsiua] to the United Nations Human Rights Council, 24 January 2010National Report of Nauru to the Human Rights Council, November 2010 External links * Selected Nauruan statute law and case law, Pacific Islands Legal Information Institute * Remarks on Nauruan law by a former Senior Legal Officer (University of the South Pacific School of Law); originally published in [1993] AU Law Lib 5. * Nauru's Online Legal Database References ","title":"Law of Nauru"},{"id":"30578291","text":"Robyn Selby Smith (born 26 November 1980 in Melbourne) is an Australian former rower.

It is situated on the banks of the river Mahatmain ( principal branch of river Falgu before disappearing in 'Taal' area of Mokama). This village consists of six settlements (or tolas in local parlance) viz Gauri, Gyaspur (near Varuna village), Abdalchak (near Shivchak village) and three settlements of Pundah (consisting two tolas - Deeh and Narayanpur besides a tola called 'Tari Par' near Mahatmain river basin). Gauri Pundah thus is the largest village in the surrounding region. It has a population of more than two thousands and a half. History and culture History and culture of Gauri Pundah village is very rich. The first part of the name of this village reflects the name of the mother goddess Gauri, the consort of Lord Shiva, whereas the second part Pundah has a famous rural temple known as Mahadeo Sthan, dedicated entirely to the worship of Shiva. This temple is so famous in the region that people from the nearby villages throng to it to offer prayers to Lord Shiva particularly on the occasion of Mahashivratri and Shravan Masa as per Vikram Calendar. Nearby located are Saptamatrika (seven mother goddesses, consorts of various Hindu gods) temple and Mahavir Sthan (temple dedicated to Lord Hanumana). Traits of a typical Magadhan culture are seen aplenty in this village. Geography Gauri Pundah is situated on the banks of the river Mahatmain ( principal branch of river Falgu before disappearing in 'Taal' area of Mokama). It is also connected to river Dhoba (another branch of river Falgu) through a traditional aquatic channel. This village consists of five settlements (or tolas in local parlance) viz Gauri, Gyaspur (near Varuna village), Abdalchak (near Shivchak village) and three settlements of Pundah (consisting two tolas - Deeh and Narayanpur besides a tola called 'Tari Par' near Mahatmain river basin). Gauri Pundah thus is the largest village in the surrounding region. It has a population of more than two thousands and half. Economy Gauri Pundah is an agrarian economy. Main crops include all types of cereals, vegetable, pulses, etc. The village is dependent on local markets of Fatuha and Daniyawan for commercial activities. Demographics Gauri Pundah consists of a large number of agricultural communities and labourers. Backward and Dalit communities form more than 98% of the population. Amongst the Dalits, extremely downtrodden communities, which are also known as Mahadalits, are prevalent here, mainly in form of Musahar. \\"Musahar\\" word came from a Sanskrit word Mushahara (meaning rat-eaters). These people used to provide maximum benefit to the farmers by eating the rodents which were hugely detrimental to the crops and by making themselves available as agricultural labour. Amongst farming communities, Kurmis and Yadavas are dominant as also is the overall case in the state of Bihar. The main beneficiary of the traditional social structure nowadays are these sections of backward communities in addition to the upper castes, which include only Brahmins, being the most regular beneficiary of the system who enjoyed traditional advantage in the feudalistic caste-ridden Indian society. Still, a vast majority of the people are yet to get any benefits arising due to modern development as they have been traditionally kept in such darkness by the higher communities who never cared to uplift them. Many extremely backward castes, Dalit and Mahadalit communities are landless, only supplying agricultural and other manual labour to the village. Their condition is very miserable and they lack all the basic amenities of the life. It is happening due to still prevailing feudal nature of the rural society here. They are yet to be liberated from the vicious cycle of abject poverty. Literacy level is below 80%, particularly low amongst women and dalit communities. There has been some advancement in the village. But, its fruits have all been cornered by the higher sections of the society leaving the landless to suffer in eternity. Recent developments The village now is ready to witness the taste of Bihar's growth story. Gauri Pundah is selected under the Rajiv Gandhi Gramin Vidyutikaran Yojana (RGGVY) to ensure rural electrification of this village. Ironically, the village was electrified till 1980. After that, it got de-electrified. However efforts are on to provide better facilities to the villagers and steps has been taken to take the voice to the higher authority. The village have a primary school and a middle school is going to open very soon. Villages have to go to Balwa village to study high school courses. Beyond matriculation, villagers go to Fatuha or nearby towns like Bakhtiarpur or Patna the capital city of Bihar. Gauri Pundah is proposed to be connected through roads to Daniawan and Fatuha markets via Nimi and Suranga Par villages respectively. The work is under progress on these two roads. Recently, the village was surveyed for establishment of a rural healthcare centre and a bridge on river Mahatmain by the local administration.

He was the fourth of a family of ten sons. His father, James Coats, was one of the founders of the Coats Group of Paisley. In the hands of Thomas and his surviving brother, Sir Peter Coats, the Ferguslie Thread Works became substantial. Coats in 1868 presented to the town of Paisley a public park, called the 'Fountains Gardens,' as a place of recreation. He took an interest in education, and in 1873 was elected chairman of the school board, an office he continued to hold until his death. He gave large sums to improve the school accommodation, and provided a playground. From 1862 to 1864 he was president of the Paisley Philosophical Institution, and in 1882 he presented to the society the Coats Observatory; he furnished it with an equatorial telescope and other instruments, and provided a residence and endowment for the curator. Coats was a collector of Scottish coins, and his collection became the largest and most valuable of its kind. He wanted a catalogue of the specimens, and entrusted the work to Edward Burns, a Scottish numismatist. But in Burns's hands the catalogue swelled into an elaborate Coinage of Scotland (1887).

Background  It is not known when Lady Shi was born. According to the Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms (), her family was from the Qi-Lu region (i.e., modern Shandong), but the same source also noted a possible alternative origin ‚Äî that she was a cousin of Shi Jingsi, a general under Jin's prince Li Keyong. She became a concubine of Yang Xingmi's during the reign of Emperor Xizong of Tang (r. 873-888) and bore him his two oldest sons, Yang Wo (born 886) and Yang Longyan (born 897). There was no record on whether Yang Xingmi made her his wife after he divorced his wife Lady Zhu in 903, but it is known that she was created the Lady of Yuzhang, while Lady Zhu previously held the greater title of Lady of Yan.Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms (ÂçÅÂúãÊò•Áßã), vol. 4.  As lady dowager  Yang Xingmi died in 905. Yang Wo succeeded him as the Tang military governor (Jiedushi) of Huainan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) and the effective ruler of rest of Yang Xingmi's domain,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 265. which effectively became an independent state after rival warlord Zhu Quanzhong seized the Tang throne and declared himself emperor of a new state of Later Liang in 907 ‚Äî although Yang Wo continued to use the Tang era name of Tianyou and thus his domain remained technically a part of the defunct Tang state.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 266. He carried the title of Prince of Hongnong, which had been bestowed by the Tang imperial emissary Li Yan. He honored his mother Lady Shi as Lady Dowager. However, Yang Wo lost most of his effective power in a coup headed by his officers Zhang Hao and Xu Wen in 907. He was angry about the situation, and Zhang and Xu thus feared that he would seize power again and carry out retribution against them. They therefore assassinated him in 908 and initially planned to divide up his territory and submit to Later Liang. However, at a subsequent emergency meeting between Zhang, Xu, and the other key officials, where Zhang initially postured that he was going to take over the domain, the official Yan Keqiu read a statement out loud (which Yan claimed to have been written by Lady Dowager Shi, but Yan himself had written) that called for Yang Longyan to succeed Yang Wo as prince. Zhang did not dare to respond, and Yang Longyan was allowed to succeed Yang Wo as the Prince of Hongnong. Soon thereafter, Xu assassinated Zhang and blamed Yang Wo's death on Zhang alone, and took over effective rein of the state, formally under Yang Longyan's authority. When Xu went to the palace to report to Lady Dowager Shi what had occurred, she tearfully responded: Xu thereafter tried to comfort her and again blamed the assassination on Zhang alone.  As queen dowager  In 919, Xu Wen urged Yang Longyan (who, by that point, was using the title of Prince of Wu, a title that Yang Xingmi held at the time of his death) to declare Wu to be a new state and declare himself emperor. Yang Longyan declined the imperial title, but changed his own title to King of Wu and stopped the use of the Tang era name, effectively declaring his state independent.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 270. He honored Lady Dowager Shi as queen dowager. She was said to have died sometime thereafter, with the death date lost to history ‚Äî but it appeared to be prior to or in 921, when Yang Longyan died and was succeeded by his younger half-brother Yang Pu, for Yang Pu then honored his own mother Lady Wang as queen dowager, implying that Queen Dowager Shi was no longer living.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 271.

It has been the episcopal seat of the present Diocese of Cesena-Sarsina since 1986, and was previously that of the Diocese of Cesena. The building of the cathedral, to replace an older one, was authorised by a papal bull of Pope Urban VI in 1378. The works started in 1385 and were paid for by the generosity of Andrea Malatesta, the lord of the city. The building was completed around the year 1405. The construction, in Romanesque-Gothic style, is attributed to the architect Undervaldo (probably Swiss). The campanile (bell tower) was built between 1443 and 1457 to designs by the Maso di Pietro and funded by Bishop Antonio Malatesta da Fossombrone (bishop of Cesena from 1435 to 1475).

After the radical rebuilding of the 1960s the only surviving original part of the structure is what remains of the door on the eastern side. Also dating from the Renaissance period is the Chapel of Saint Tobias next to the cathedral, now in use as the cathedral museum. However, the old hospital of the same name which gave assistance to pilgrims no longer exists. The fa√ßade of the cathedral was completed only at the end of the 15th century with works attributed to the Venetian architect Mauro Coducci (1440‚Äì1504). The mortal remains of Saint Maurus of Cesena (d. 946) are preserved here, in the Altar of Saint John, one of the greatest sculptures of Cesena produced between 1494 and 1505 by the Lombard sculptor Giovanni Battista Bregno da Osteno.

He was one of the main promoters of the Carolina Company which established a Scottish colony at Port Royal, South Carolina. Cochrane was implicated in the Rye House plot (1683) and the Monmouth Rebellion, but escaped to Rotterdam, where he remained till the death of Charles II.

Their result is the construction of an efficient pseudorandom function. Let p and l be prime numbers with l p‚àí1. Select an element g ‚àà {\\\\mathbb F_p}^* of multiplicative order l. Then for each n-dimensional vector a = (a0,a1, ..., an)‚àà (\\\\mathbb F_{l})^{n} they define the function :f_{a}(x) = g^{a_{0}\\\\cdot a_{1}^{x_{1}} a_{2}^{x_{2}}...a_{n}^{x_{n}}} \\\\in \\\\mathbb F_p where x = x1 ‚Ä¶ xn is the bit representation of integer x, 0 ‚â§ x ‚â§ 2n‚àí1, with some extra leading zeros if necessary. Example Let p = 7 and l = 3; so l p‚àí1. Select g = 4 ‚àà {\\\\mathbb F_7}^* of multiplicative order 3 (since 43 = 64 ‚â° 1 mod 7). For n = 3, a = (1, 1, 2, 1) and x = 5 (the bit representation of 5 is 101), we can compute f_{a}(5) as follows: :f_{a}(x) = g^{a_{0}\\\\cdot a_{1}^{x_{1}} a_{2}^{x_{2}}...a_{n}^{x_{n}}} \\\\in \\\\mathbb F_p :f_{a}(5) = 4^{1\\\\cdot 1^{1} 2^{0} 1^{1}} = 4^{1} = 4 \\\\in \\\\mathbb F_7 Efficiency The evaluation of function f_{a}(x) in the Naor‚ÄìReingold construction can be done very efficiently. Computing the value of the function f_{a}(x) at any given point is comparable with one modular exponentiation and n-modular multiplications. This function can be computed in parallel by threshold circuits of bounded depth and polynomial size. The Naor‚ÄìReingold function can be used as the basis of many cryptographic schemes including symmetric encryption, authentication and digital signatures. Security of the function Assume that an attacker sees several outputs of the function, e.g. f_{a}(1) = g^{a_{1}}, f_{a}(2) = g^{a_{2}}, f_{a}(3) = g^{a_{1}a_{2}}, ... f_{a}(k) = g^{a_{1}^{x_{1}} a_{2}^{x_{2}}...a_{n}^{x_{n}}} and wants to compute f_{a}(k + 1). Assume for simplicity that x1 = 0, then the attacker needs to solve the computational Diffie‚ÄìHellman (CDH) between f_a (1)= g^{a_{1}} and f_{a}(k) = g^{a_{2}^{x_{2}} ...a_{n}^{x_{n}}} to get f_{a}(k+1) = g^{a_{1}a_{2}^{x_{2}} \\\\dots a_{n}^{x_{n}}}. In general, moving from k to k + 1 changes the bit pattern and unless k + 1 is a power of 2 one can split the exponent in f_{a}(k + 1) so that the computation corresponds to computing the Diffie‚ÄìHellman key between two of the earlier results. This attacker wants to predict the next sequence element. Such an attack would be very bad‚Äîbut it's also possible to fight it off by working in groups with a hard Diffie‚ÄìHellman problem (DHP). Example: An attacker sees several outputs of the function e.g. f_{a}(5) = 4^{1^{1} 2^{0} 1^{1}} = 4^{1} = 4 , as in the previous example, and f_{a}(1) = 4^{1^{0} 2^{0} 1^{1}} = 4^{1} = 4 . Then, the attacker wants to predict the next sequence element of this function, f_{a}(6). However, the attacker cannot predict the outcome of f_{a}(6) from knowing f_{a}(1) and f_{a}(5). There are other attacks that would be very bad for a pseudorandom number generator: the user expects to get random numbers from the output, so of course the stream should not be predictable, but even more, it should be indistinguishable from a random string. Let \\\\mathcal{A}^f denote the algorithm \\\\mathcal{A} with access to an oracle for evaluating the function f_{a}(x) . Suppose the decisional Diffie‚ÄìHellman assumption holds for \\\\mathbb F_p , Naor and Reingold show that for every probabilistic polynomial time algorithm \\\\mathcal{A} and sufficiently large n : \\\\text{Pr }[\\\\mathcal{A}^{f_{a}(x)}(p,g) \\\\to 1] - \\\\text{Pr }[\\\\mathcal{A}^{R} (p,g)\\\\to 1] is negligible. The first probability is taken over the choice of the seed s = (p, g, a) and the second probability is taken over the random distribution induced on p, g by \\\\mathcal{I}\\\\mathcal{G} (n) , instance generator, and the random choice of the function R_{a}(x) among the set of all \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^{n} \\\\to \\\\mathbb F_p functions. Linear complexity One natural measure of how useful a sequence may be for cryptographic purposes is the size of its linear complexity. The linear complexity of an n-element sequence W(x), x = 0,1,2,‚Ä¶,n ‚Äì 1, over a ring \\\\mathcal{R} is the length l of the shortest linear recurrence relation W(x + l) = Al‚àí1 W(x +l‚àí1) + ‚Ä¶ + A0 W(x), x = 0,1,2,‚Ä¶, n ‚Äì l ‚àí1 with A0, ‚Ä¶, Al‚àí1 ‚àà \\\\mathcal{R}, which is satisfied by this sequence. For some \\\\gamma > 0,n ‚â• (1+ \\\\gamma) \\\\log l, for any \\\\delta > 0 , sufficiently large l, the linear complexity of the sequence f_{a}(x),0 ‚â§ x ‚â§ 2n-1, denoted by L_a satisfies :L_{a} \\\\geqslant \\\\begin{cases} l^{1-\\\\ \\\\delta\\\\,\\\\\\\\!} &\\\\text{, if } \\\\gamma\\\\,\\\\\\\\! \\\\geqslant 2\\\\\\\\\\\\ l^{\\\\left (\\\\tfrac{\\\\ \\\\gamma\\\\,\\\\\\\\!}{2-\\\\ \\\\delta\\\\,\\\\\\\\!}\\\\right )} &\\\\text{, if } \\\\gamma\\\\,\\\\\\\\! < 2 \\\\end{cases} for all except possibly at most 3(l - 1)^{n - \\\\delta} vectors a ‚àà (\\\\mathbb F_{l})^{n} . The bound of this work has disadvantages, namely it does not apply to the very interesting case \\\\log p \\\\approx \\\\log n \\\\approx {n.} Uniformity of distribution The statistical distribution of f_{a}(x) is exponentially close to uniform distribution for almost all vectors a ‚àà (\\\\mathbb F_{l})^{n} . Let {\\\\mathbf D}_a be the discrepancy of the set \\\\\\\\{f_a (x) 0 \\\\leq x \\\\leq 2^{n-1}\\\\\\\\}. Thus, if n = \\\\log p is the bit length of p then for all vectors a ‚àà (\\\\mathbb F_{l})^{n} the bound {\\\\mathbf D}_a\\\\leq \\\\Delta (l,p) holds, where :\\\\Delta (l,p) = \\\\begin{cases} p^{\\\\left (\\\\tfrac{1-\\\\ \\\\gamma\\\\,\\\\\\\\!}{2}\\\\right )}l^{\\\\left (\\\\tfrac{-1}{2}\\\\right )}\\\\log^{2}p &\\\\text{ if } l \\\\geqslant p^{\\\\gamma\\\\,\\\\\\\\!}\\\\\\\\\\\\ p^{\\\\left (\\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\right )}l^{-1}\\\\log^{2}p &\\\\text{ if } p^{\\\\gamma\\\\,\\\\\\\\!} > l \\\\geqslant p^{\\\\left (\\\\tfrac{2}{3}\\\\right )} \\\\\\\\\\\\ p^{\\\\left (\\\\tfrac{1}{4}\\\\right )}l^{\\\\left (\\\\tfrac{-5}{8}\\\\right )}\\\\log^{2}p &\\\\text{ if } p^{\\\\left (\\\\tfrac{2}{3}\\\\right )} > l \\\\geqslant p^{\\\\left (\\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\right )} \\\\\\\\\\\\ p^{\\\\left (\\\\tfrac{1}{8}\\\\right )}l^{\\\\left (\\\\tfrac{-3}{8}\\\\right )}\\\\log^{2}p &\\\\text{ if } p^{\\\\left (\\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\right )} > l \\\\geqslant p^{\\\\left (\\\\tfrac{1}{3}\\\\right )} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{cases} and :\\\\gamma = 2.5 - \\\\log 3 = 0.9150\\\\cdots Although this property does not seem to have any immediate cryptographic implications, the inverse fact, namely non uniform distribution, if true would have disastrous consequences for applications of this function. Sequences in elliptic curve The elliptic curve version of this function is of interest as well. In particular, it may help to improve the cryptographic security of the corresponding system. Let p > 3 be prime and let E be an elliptic curve over \\\\mathbb F_p , then each vector a defines a finite sequence in the subgroup \\\\langle G\\\\rangle as: :F_{a}(x) = (a_{1}^{x_{1}} a_{2}^{x_{2}}\\\\dots a_{n}^{x_{n}})G where x = x_1 \\\\dots x_n is the bit representation of integer x, 0 \\\\leq x \\\\leq 2^{n-1}. The Naor‚ÄìReingold elliptic curve sequence is defined as : u_{k} = X (f_{a}(k))\\\\; \\\\mbox{where } X (P) \\\\mbox{ is the abscissa of}\\\\; P \\\\in E. If the decisional Diffie‚ÄìHellman assumption holds, the index k is not enough to compute u_k in polynomial time, even if an attacker performs polynomially many queries to a random oracle.

Life Cochrane was born in Glasgow, where his father was engaged in the law. Having received some education he was placed with a bookseller, but set out to seek his fortune in London before he was twenty. Here, after a residence of some years, he entered into partnership with John White, and the firm of White, Cochrane Co. carried on an extensive business in Fleet Street, until they became involved in the major trade ruin which followed the failure of Archibald Constable. Cochrane later became manager of the foreign bookselling house of Messrs. Treuttel, Wurtz, Treuttel junior, and Richter of Soho Square, who published in July 1827 the first number of the Foreign Quarterly Review. The editorship was accepted by Cochrane. The review was brought out by the same firm to the twenty-fourth number (October 1833) inclusive, and by their successor, Adolphus Richter, to the twenty-seventh (August 1834). The twenty- eighth number (December 1834) was issued by Cochrane at his own risk. Richter became bankrupt on 9 December 1834, and Cochrane established Cochrane's Foreign Quarterly Review (1835); but only two numbers appeared. The Foreign Quarterly Review came to an end in 1846, and was then incorporated with the Westminster Review. Cochrane was an unsuccessful candidate for the librarianship of the Faculty of Advocates in Edinburgh, and for some time in that city acted as the editor of the Caledonian Mercury. Cochrane later lived for some time at Hertford as editor of a local newspaper. On 17 February 1841 he became the first secretary and librarian of the London Library, founded in the previous year. This institution was opened on 3 May 1842 at 49 Pall Mall. In April 1845 the committee took a lease of 14 St James's Square, a house on the site still occupied by the library. Cochrane died at his apartments in the library on 11 May 1852, in his seventy-second year. In the view of Henry Tedder, who wrote Cochrane's biography in the DNB, \\"Cochrane was a zealous and able librarian, with an excellent knowledge of bibliography and literary history\\". Works Cochrane wrote a pamphlet, \\"The Case stated between the Public Libraries and the Booksellers\\" (anon. 1813), calling attention to the hardship suffered by publishers, who were then obliged, under the Copyright Act, to supply copies of their most expensive books to eleven public libraries. He and his partner were examined before the parliamentary committee of 1813. The minutes of evidence include a list of works, such as James Sowerby's English Botany, Aylmer Bourke Lambert's Genus Pinus, and so on, published by them. The select committee of 1818 recommended that only five copies should be claimed for public libraries in future, which was made law by the statute of 1835. A friendship with Robert Cadell caused him to be chosen to catalogue Sir Walter Scott's library at Abbotsford. It was necessary to print the catalogue, and extra copies were struck off for members of the Maitland and Bannatyne Clubs (1838). References to passages in Scott's writings connected with the books throw light on Scott's literary history. The first catalogue of the London Library (1842) was issued by Cochrane. In 1847 an enlarged edition of the catalogue appeared, and a short time before his death a supplementary volume, in which a general classified index is announced. He also published The English Works of Roger Ascham, preceptor to Queen Elizabeth, a new edition [ed. by J. G. Cochrane], London, 1815, which includes a life by Samuel Johnson.

A generalization for arbitrary composite moduli m=p_1,\\\\dots p_r with arbitrary distinct primes p_1,\\\\dots ,p_r \\\\ge 5 will be present here. Let \\\\mathbb{Z}_{m} = \\\\\\\\{0,1,...,m-1\\\\\\\\} . For integers a,b \\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}_{m} with gcd (a,m) = 1 a generalized inversive congruential sequence (y_{n})_{n \\\\geqslant 0} of elements of \\\\mathbb{Z}_{m} is defined by : y_{0} = {\\\\rm seed} : y_{n+1}\\\\equiv a y_{n}^{\\\\varphi(m)-1} + b \\\\pmod m \\\\text{, }n \\\\geqslant 0 where \\\\varphi(m)=(p_{1}-1)\\\\dots (p_{r}-1) denotes the number of positive integers less than m which are relatively prime to m.

Then : y_{n}\\\\equiv m_{1}y_{n}^{(1)} + m_{2}y_{n}^{(2)} + \\\\dots + m_{r}y_{n}^{(r)} \\\\pmod m. This theorem shows that an implementation of Generalized Inversive Congruential Generator is possible, where exact integer computations have to be performed only in \\\\mathbb{Z}_{p_{1}},\\\\dots , \\\\mathbb{Z}_{p_{r}} but not in \\\\mathbb{Z}_{m}. Proof: First, observe that m_{i}\\\\equiv 0\\\\pmod {p_{j}}, \\\\; \\\\text {for} \\\\; i e j, and hence y_{n}\\\\equiv m_{1}y_{n}^{(1)} + m_{2}y_{n}^{(2)} + \\\\dots + m_{r}y_{n}^{(r)} \\\\pmod m if and only if y_{n}\\\\equiv m_{i} (y_{n}^{(i)})\\\\pmod {p_{i}}, for 1\\\\le i \\\\le r which will be shown on induction on n \\\\geqslant 0 . Recall that y_{0}\\\\equiv m_{i} (y_{0}^{(i)})\\\\pmod {p_{i}} is assumed for 1\\\\le i \\\\le r. Now, suppose that 1\\\\le i \\\\le r and y_{n}\\\\equiv m_{i} (y_{n}^{(i)})\\\\pmod {p_{i}} for some integer n \\\\geqslant 0 . Then straightforward calculations and Fermat's Theorem yield : y_{n+1}\\\\equiv a y_{n}^{\\\\varphi(m)-1} + b \\\\equiv m_{i}(a_{i}m_{i}^{\\\\varphi(m)}(y_{n}^{(i)})^{\\\\varphi(m)-1}+ b_{i})\\\\equiv m_{i}(a_{i}(y_{n}^{(i)})^{p_{i}-2} + b_{i})\\\\equiv m_{i}(y_{n+1}^{(i)}) \\\\pmod {p_{i}}, which implies the desired result. Generalized Inversive Congruential Pseudorandom Numbers are well equidistributed in one dimension. A reliable theoretical approach for assessing their statistical independence properties is based on the discrepancy of s-tuples of pseudorandom numbers. Discrepancy bounds of the GIC Generator We use the notation D_m ^{s}=D_m (x_0,\\\\dots , x_m-1) where x_n=(x_n, x_n+1 ,\\\\dots , x_n+s-1) [0,1)^s of Generalized Inversive Congruential Pseudorandom Numbers for s\\\\ge 2. Higher bound :Let s\\\\ge 2 :Then the discrepancy D_m ^s satisfies : D_m ^s < m^{-1/2} ( \\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi} \\\\log m + \\\\frac{7}{5})^s \\\\textstyle \\\\prod_{i=1}^r (2s-2 + s(p_i)^{-1/2})+ s_{m}^{-1} for any Generalized Inversive Congruential operator. Lower bound: :There exist Generalized Inversive Congruential Generators with : D_m ^s \\\\frac{1}{2(\\\\pi+2)} m^{-1/2} : \\\\textstyle \\\\prod_{i=1}^r (\\\\frac {p_{i} - 3}{p_{i} - 1})^{1/2} for all dimension s 2. For a fixed number r of prime factors of m, Theorem 2 shows that D_m^{(s)} = O (m^{-1/2} (\\\\log m )^s) for any Generalized Inversive Congruential Sequence. In this case Theorem 3 implies that there exist Generalized Inversive Congruential Generators having a discrepancy D_m^{(s)} which is at least of the order of magnitude m^{-1/2} for all dimension s\\\\ge 2. However, if m is composed only of small primes, then r can be of an order of magnitude (\\\\log m)/\\\\log\\\\log m and hence \\\\textstyle \\\\prod_{i=1}^r (2s-2 + s(p_i)^{-1/2})= O{(m^\\\\epsilon )} for every \\\\epsilon> 0. Therefore, one obtains in the general case D_m^{s}=O(m^{-1/2+\\\\epsilon}) for every \\\\epsilon> 0. Since \\\\textstyle \\\\prod_{i=1}^r ((p_{i} - 3)/(p_{i} - 1))^{1/2} \\\\geqslant 2^{-r/2} , similar arguments imply that in the general case the lower bound in Theorem 3 is at least of the order of magnitude m^{-1/2 - \\\\epsilon} for every \\\\epsilon> 0. It is this range of magnitudes where one also finds the discrepancy of m independent and uniformly distributed random points which almost always has the order of magnitude m^{-1/2} (\\\\log\\\\log m)^{1/2} according to the law of the iterated logarithm for discrepancies. In this sense, Generalized Inversive Congruential Pseudo-random Numbers model true random numbers very closely.

Later local opposition to licenses turned to open \\"warfare\\" in the \\"oyster wars\\" when a fleet of state vessels fought \\"oyster pirates\\" in armed conflicts. Bessie Jones was assigned to St. Mary's County, Maryland in 1902 and later to the Hill's Point, Maryland areas. That force became the Maryland State Fishery Force under the Conservation Commission of Maryland with which the schooner served when the entire force, boats and men, became a part of the U.S. Naval Reserve in an agreement between the state and the Navy in 1917. The force was one of the elements forming today's Maryland Department of Natural Resources Police. In January 1893 new Driggs-Schroeder guns for the Oyster Navy had arrived and were to be installed on the schooners May Brown, Anna B. Smith and Bessie Jones.References for Julia Hamilton specifically mention a six pounder gun which is one of the types made by Driggs-Schroeder. The oyster wars continued with one account involving Bessie Jones in 1906 resulting in the Captain, Douglas Russel killing one of the oyster pirates. Russel had been warned by a dredger named Harris that the law was not going to keep him from dredging the Cobb Island beds. Russel warned the dredger that \\"The law and my 45-70 rifle can do just that.\\" The dredger was caught by Russel illegally night dredging, and Russel began firing into the dredger's rigging to disable it for arrest. Harris fired back and Russel fired back killing Harris. The Navy approached the Conservation Commission shortly after the nation's entry into World War I proposing the Commission's boats be used to maintain constant local patrols. The state legislature agreed that the boats and men of the state force would become part of the U.S. Naval Reserve providing they patrol the same districts for fisheries enforcement as well as federal interests with the benefit that patrol time would be increased and the expense for all be paid by the federal government. The Maryland State Fishery Force boats began operating under a contract in which they were under a free lease to the United States Navy in August 1917, serving as Squadron Number 8 of the 5th Naval District, patrolling their regular areas enforcing state conservation law and federal laws. They were under the command of a Conservation Commission member who was also a Lieutenant in the Navy with all expenses, wages, supplies and repairs paid by the federal government. During the wartime dual service the schooner was given the identification number SP-1476. There is no indication of the vessel being commissioned. The schooner served until returned to normal Conservation Commission duty on 27 November 1918. Bessie Jones continued to patrol the usual waters enforcing conservation law as well as federal law under the agreement. The Commission began replacing its older sailing vessels with new power boats in 1918. Two new boats, Kent and Talbot were acquired with Severn being purchased. The schooners Bessie Jones, Helen Baughman, Julia Hamilton, and Anna B. Smith were retired and sold along with the motorized, converted schooner, Daisy Archer. Bessie Jones was sold for $1,750.00.

Various uses are: to verify the identity of a (species), to allow study, increase public knowledge of zoology. Zoological specimens are extremely diverse. Examples are bird and mammal study skins, mounted specimens, skeletal material, casts, pinned insects, dried material, animals preserved in liquid preservatives, and microscope slides. Natural history museums are repositories of zoological specimens Study skins Study skins of Garrulus glandarius in Museum f√ºr Naturkunde, BerlinBird and mammal specimens are conserved as dry study skins, a form of taxidermy. The skin is removed from the animal's carcass, treated with absorbents, and filled with cotton or polyester batting (In the past plant fibres or sawdust were used). Bird specimens have a long, thin, wooden dowel wrapped in batting at their center. The dowel is often intentionally longer than the bird's body and exits at the animal's vent. This exposed dowel provides a place to handle the bird without disturbing the feathers. Mammal study skins do not normally utilize wooden dowels, instead preparators use wire to support the legs and tail of mammals. Labels are attached to a leg of the specimen with thread or string. Heat and chemicals are sometimes used to aid the drying of study skins. Skeletal Preparations (Osteology) Hog-nosed skunk skeleton Osteological collections consist of cleaned, complete and partial skeletons, crania of Vertebrates, mainly birds and mammals. They are used in studies of comparative anatomy and to identify bones from archaeological sites. Human bones are used in medical and forensic studies. Molluscs Dry specimens of Mollusca in Museum Wiesbaden In museum collections it is common for the dry material to greatly exceed the amount of material that is preserved in alcohol. The shells minus their soft parts are kept in card trays within drawers or in glass tubes, often as lots (a lot is a collection of a single species taken from a single locality on a single occasion). Shell collections sometimes suffer from Byne's disease which also affects birds eggs. The study of dry mollusc shells is called conchology as distinct from malacology (wet specimens). Insects and similar invertebrates :Main articles: Insect collecting A pinned wasp. The dried insect is under attack from pests and this drawer will have to be frozen to contain the problem. Most hard-bodied insect specimens and some other hard-bodied invertebrates such as certain Arachnida, are preserved as pinned specimens. Either while still fresh, or after rehydrating them if necessary because they had dried out, specimens are transfixed by special stainless steel entomological pins. As the insect dries the internal tissues solidify and, possibly aided to some extent by the integument, they grip the pin and secure the specimen in place on the pin. Very small, delicate specimens may instead be secured by fine steel points driven into slips of card, or glued to card points or similar attachments that in turn are pinned in the same way as entire mounted insects. The pins offer a means of handling the specimens without damage, and they also bear labels for descriptive and reference data. Once dried, the specimens may be kept in conveniently sized open trays. The bottoms of the trays are lined with a material suited to receiving and holding entomological pins securely and conveniently. Cork and foam plastics are convenient examples. However, open trays are very vulnerable to attack by museum beetle and similar pests, so such open trays are stored in turn inside glass-topped, insect-proof drawers, commonly protected by suitable pesticides or repellents or barriers. Alternatively, some museums store the pinned specimens directly in larger trays or drawers that are glass-topped and stored in cabinets. In contrast to such dried specimens, soft-bodied specimens most commonly are kept in \\"wet collections\\", meaning that they are stored in alcohol or similar preservative or fixative liquids, according to the intended function. Small specimens, whether hard or soft bodied, and whether entire, dissected, or sectioned, may be stored as microscope slide preparations. Wet specimens Collection of spiders preserved in alcohol (spirit collection) \\"Wet\\" specimen collections are stored in different solutions. A very old method is to store the specimen in 70% ethanol with various additives after fixing with formalinBLUM, J.: Formol als Conservierungsfl√ºssigkeit. Zool.

Data Label accompanying a bird skin.Note that the locality, date, identity of the specimen and collection catalogue numbers are given on the securely attached label Minimum data associated with zoological specimens is the place and date of collection, attached to the specimen by a label. Additional information is the name of the collector and the habitat. Tissue from specimens may be saved for genetic studies (molecular data, DNA). Depending on the animal group, other data may be included, for instance in bird collections the bird‚Äôs breeding condition, weight, colours of its eyes, bills and legs and nature of the stomach contents. Composite specimens A single specimen may be a composite of preparations sharing a unique number. An example would be a vertebrate with an alcohol-preserved skin and viscera, a cleared and stained head, the post-cranial dried skeleton, histological, glass slides of various organs, and frozen tissue samples. This specimen could also be a voucher for a publication, or photographs and audiotape. Voucher specimens A voucher is a representative specimen of the animal used in a study, such as a specimen collected as part of an ecological survey or a specimen which was the source of DNA for a molecular study. Voucher specimens confirm the identity of the species referred to in the study. They are a backup against misidentification, changing species concepts which mislead results. Type specimens are a special type of voucher specimen used in taxonomy.

One of the founding members of the DFB (Deutscher Fussball Bund, en:German Football Association) at Leipzig in 1900, the club is part of the tradition of current-day side SV Nord Wedding. __TOC__ History Rapide was established on 1 October 1893 as Berliner Fu√üball- und Cricket-Club Rapide 1893 and made a handful of appearances in the top-flight Oberliga Berlin in the early 1900s. In 1920, they were joined by FC Falke 1913 Berlin before going through a series of name changes. They briefly adopted the name Berliner FC Rapide 93 Niedersch√∂nhausen on 23 August 1923, for the northern city neighbourhood where the team was based, before becoming Deutscher FC Rapide 93 Berlin later in the year. They began playing as BFC Rapide Niedersch√∂nhausen again in 1927.Gr√ºne, Hardy (2001). Enzyklop√§die des deutschen Ligafu√üballs 7. Vereinslexikon. Kassel: Agon-Sportverlag. . They remained a lower tier local side through to the end of World War II. Following the war occupying Allied authorities banned most organizations across the country as part of the process of de-Nazification and the club was briefly lost in 1945. The former membership was re-organized into two clubs ‚Äì Berliner FC Rapide and Sportgemeinschaft Rapide 93 Niedersch√∂nhausen ‚Äì reflecting the Cold War division of the city into West and East Berlin. On 25 May 1950, FC joined SC Wedding Berlin to form Berliner FC Wedding. SG became BSG Empor Pankow in March 1953 and was part of the separate football competition the emerged in East Germany until folding on 4 July 1967. Wedding merged with SV Nord- Nordstern Berlin on 1 July 2001 to create present-day club SV Nord-Wedding 1893. Stadium From its founding through to the end of World War II, Rapide played in several different stadiums; Exerzierweide Sch√∂nhauser Stra√üe (1893‚Äì1900), Schebera-Platz Gesundbrunnen (1900‚Äì04), and either of Schlosspark Pankow and Bismarksta√üe Niedersch√∂nhausen (1904‚Äì45).

P. (2007). Work Systems: The Methods, Measurement & Management of Work, Prentice Hall, By providing a small increase to the normal time in each cycle, a worker can still be able to cover lost time and complete the work assigned to him or her. Allowance technique There are two types of interruption: (1) interruption related to work (2) interruption not related to work. For example, a machine breakdown, rest break to overcome fatigue, and receiving instruction from the manager are the interruption related to work, but personal needs, lunch breaks, and personal telephone calls are interruptions not related to work. However, the two types of interruption are both essential for the worker because it is almost impossible to work continually during a regular shift. =Personal needs, fatigue, and unavoidable delays allowance= The standard time is calculated by multiplying the normal time by 1 plus the PFD allowance:Niebel, B., Freivalds, A. (2008) Methods, Standards and Work design, McGraw-Hill, T_\\\\text{std} = T_n*(1 + A_\\\\text{pfd}) *T_\\\\text{std}= standard time. *T_n = normal time. *A_\\\\text{pfd} = PFD allowance. Personal needs The personal needs allowance is the time that is associated with workers‚Äô daily personal needs which include going to the restroom, phone calls, going to the water fountain, and similar interruptions of a personal nature. However, it is categorized as 5%, but it also depends on the work environment, e.g. in terms of discomfort and temperature. Fatigue The fatigue allowance is intended to cover the time that the worker should be given to overcome fatigue due to work related stress and conditions. There are three factors that cause fatigue: (1) physical factors like standing and use of force, (2) mental and cognitive factors like mental strain and eye strain, and (3) environmental and work factors like poor lighting, noise, and heat. Unavoidable Delays Unavoidable delays are categorized under unavoidable interruption that occurs at random times during the day in the workplace. They usually refer to work-related events like cleaning up at the end of the shift, and machine breakdowns or malfunctions. Unavoidable delays occur because of many random events at work stations.

A Gracie Worlds and National Champion, Migliarese is a trainer, training partner and coach to UFC and MMA fighters as well as World and Pan-Am Champions. Migliarese is also a master-level yoga instructor, author/creator of Yoga For Fighters and has many years of training in judo. He is the founder of Jiu-Jitsu Share Online Community , Jiu-JitsuMatrix (a video newsletter and online learning community) and one of the co-founders/co-owners of Matrix Fights Promotion Company . He currently lives in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he teaches at Balance Studios which he co-owns with his brother, Ricardo Migliarese. Migliarese is the head of Team Balance International. Early life Migliarese began his martial arts journey in 1988 at Maxercise in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with Steve Maxwell when he was 12 years old. Maxercise had affiliations with both Royce Gracie's Academy in Los Angeles, California, and Relson Gracie's Academy in Hawaii. Three months after he started training, Migliarese met Rorion Gracie and Royce Gracie at a seminar and shortly thereafter, he was introduced to Relson Gracie. Migliarese was quickly taken in by the Gracie family as he showed great promise in the sport. It was Relson though, that focused his attention on Migliarese's training and became his mentor and inspiration. Car accident In January 1993, Migliarese was in a devastating car accident that initially put him in a coma. He suffered injuries including broken nose, shoulder, collarbone, all of the ribs on the right side of his body, all of the fingers on his right hand and his pelvis as well as damage to his internal organs. This accident, which made him nearly immobile for 6 months, changed the direction of his training and approach to Jiu-Jitsu forever.http://ma- mags.com/srchmag.php?SrchFor=Phil%20Migliarese%20III%20&SrchHow;=all&Search;=searchhttp://balancestudios.net/wp- content/uploads/2010/05/Article_MMAworldwide.pdf He credits his yoga breathing and practice for his recovery. Originally not expected to walk or train again, Migliarese was doing some light training and in attendance to support Royce at UFC 1 in November 1993. Given a clean bill of health in early 1994, he was back on the mat as one of Royce's training partners for UFC 2 in Denver, Colorado. Brazilian jiu-jitsu training He spent much of the 1990s at the Gracie Academy, learning the Gracie method of teacher training directly from Grand Master Helio Gracie or training with Relson in Hawaii. Migliarese returned to Philadelphia in 2000 to take over as head instructor of Relson's affiliate school. As a brown belt in 2001, Migliarese won the Gracie World Championship and was 2nd in the open division. In 2002, Migliarese and Rick opened Balance Studios, the only Relson Gracie affiliate in Philadelphia.http://www.relsongracie.com/index.php?option=com_k2&view;=item&layout;=item&id;=5&Itemid;=60 That year at the Arnolds Classic/Gracie Worlds Migliarese won what would be his most well known match against UFC fighter Renato ‚ÄúBabalu‚Äù Sobral. In March 2003, at the Gracie Worlds in Columbus, Ohio, he became the youngest person to receive the honor of black belt from Relson Gracie and was among the first Americans to receive this promotion.Relson Gracie#cite note-10 Yoga practice Migliarese also spent a great deal of time studying and practicing his other passion, Ashtanga yoga. Introduced to yoga at the grade school level, Migliarese immediately took to the ancient system of breathing and postures and continued his practice regularly. In 1997, he traveled to Mysore, India to study with Sri K. Pattabhi Jois and asked for permission to teach Series I and II, which was the custom of the time, prior to current certifications. During this time, Migliarese not only practiced the Yoga himself, but watched and studied the methods that the Guru used in adjusting others to aide in their practice. Migliarese teaches Ashtanga Yoga in class and private lessons and utilizes some of the postures in a specific order for his Yoga For Fighters DVD . MMA trainer Migliarese and Rick have trained professional athletes and MMA fighters, including Philadelphia Eagles Trey Thomas and Winston Justice, UFC fighters Frankie Edgar and Waylon Lowe, Bellator fighter Tim Carpenter, several World and Pan-Am Jiu-Jitsu winners as well as local police officers and FBI agents.

The vision of FMI is to support this approach: if the real product is to be assembled from a wide range of parts interacting in complex ways, each controlled by a complex set of physical laws, then it should be possible to create a virtual product that can be assembled from a set of models that each represent a combination of parts, each a model of the physical laws as well as a model of the control systems (using electronics, hydraulics, and digital software) assembled digitally. The FMI standard thus provides the means for model based development of systems and is used for example for designing functions that are driven by electronic devices inside vehicles (e.g. ESP controllers, active safety systems, combustion controllers). Activities from systems modelling, simulation, validation and test can be covered with the FMI based approach. To create the FMI standard, a large number of software companies and research centers have worked in a cooperation project established through a European consortium that has been conducted by Dassault Syst√®mes under the name of MODELISAR. The MODELISAR project started in 2008 to define the FMI specifications, deliver technology studies, prove the FMI concepts through use cases elaborated by the consortium partners and enable tool vendors to build advanced prototypes or in some cases even products. The development of the FMI specifications was coordinated by Daimler AG. After the end of the MODELISAR project in 2011, FMI is managed and developed as a Modelica Association Project (MAP). The four required FMI aspects of creating models capable of being assembled have been covered in Modelisar project: * FMI for model exchange, * FMI for co-simulation, * FMI for applications, * FMI for PLM (integration of models and related data in product life-cycle management). In practice, the FMI implementation by a software modelling tool enables the creation of a simulation model that can be interconnected or the creation of a software library called FMU (Functional Mock-up Unit).  The FMI approach  The typical FMI approach is described in the following stages: * a modelling environment describes a product sub-system by differential, algebraic and discrete equations with time, state and step-events. These models can be large for usage in off-line or on-line simulation or can be used in embedded control systems; * as an alternative, an engineering tool defines the controller code for controlling a vehicle system; * such tools generate and export the component in an FMU (Functional Mock-up Unit); * an FMU can then be imported in another environment to be executed; * several FMUs can ‚Äì by this way ‚Äì cooperate at runtime through a co-simulation environment, thanks to the FMI definitions of their interfaces. License The FMI specifications are distributed under open source licenses: * the specifications are licensed under CC-BY-SA (Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike 3.0 Unported) CC_BY_SA 3.0 * the C-header and XML-schema files that accompany this document are available under the BSD license with the extension that modifications must also be provided under the BSD license. Architecture Each FMU (Functional Mock-up Unit) is distributed in a zip file with the extension \\".fmu\\" which contains: * an XML file containing among other things the definition of the variables used by the FMU; * all the equations used by the model (defined as a set of C functions); * optional other data, such as parameter tables, user interface, documentation which may be needed by the model. Example Below is an example of an FMI model description issued from Modelica. ... Comparison to Simulink S-Functions FMI is often compared to Simulink S-Functions since both technologies can be used to integrate third-party tools together. S-Functions are used to specify a computer language description of a dynamic system. They are compiled as MEX-files that are dynamically linked into MATLAB when needed. S-Functions use a calling syntax that interacts with Simulink‚Äôs equation solvers. This interaction is similar to the interaction that takes place between built-in Simulink blocks and the solvers. FMI proponents explain that FMI models have several advantages over Simulink S-Functions: * S-Functions format is proprietary, whereas the FMI schema is licensed under a BSD license. * The building blocks of S-Functions are much more complex than FMI, making it very difficult to integrate in simulators other than Simulink itself. * Furthermore, the S-Functions format is specific to Simulink. * S-Functions are not suited for embedded systems, due to the memory overhead of S-Functions. There are also several limitations cited when using FMI/FMU: * Memory - Parameters, states, inputs, and outputs are not exposed directly to the outside, which is in contrast to how ECU software is normally organized with respect to memory to allow transparency, simplicity, and efficiency. * Event handling - Events could increase the runtime for real- time systems in an unpredictable manner. * Potentially dangerous features can be included on ECU - Some features that make sense for offline simulations should not be present on the ECU. Examples of features that are either supported or not explicitly forbidden in the FMI include logging and I/O operations such as print(). * Data type support - More supported data types are necessary for optimized code. For example, there is not a way to distinguish between a uint8 and uint32 variable.  Accompanying standards and recommendations  In May 2014, the project group Smart Systems Engineering (SmartSE) of the ProSTEP iViP Association published its Recommendation PSI 11 for the cross-company behavior model exchange.ProSTEP iViP Recommendation PSI 11, Smart Systems Engineering, Behavior Model Exchange, V 1.0, May 2014. FMI thereby is the technological basis. The PSI 11 specifies interaction scenarios, use cases, a reference process and templates, which thereby could ease the industrial application. End of 2016 the group published a movie, which should highlight the industrial benefits.Benefits of utilizing FMI for realizing cross-company Systems Engineering, Status February 2017 See also * 20-sim * Modelica * Simulink References External links * FMI main site Category:Scientific modeling Category:Simulation software ","title":"Functional Mock-up Interface"},{"id":"30578785","text":"Manuel Anatol Aristegi (8 May 1903 ‚Äì 17 May 1990) was a naturalized French professional football player.  Football career  Anatol was born in Irun, a town in the Basque Country of Spain. He played for three clubs in the country; hometown club Real Uni√≥n, Athletic Bilbao and Real Madrid. In 1929, Anatol ventured to France and joined Racing Paris.Gilles Gauthey, Le football professionnel fran√ßais, Paris, 1961, p.18. √âdit√©e et diffus√©e par l'auteur. With Racing, he captained the club to the final of the Coupe de France in his second season with the club. In the final, Racing were defeated 3‚Äì1 by FC S√®te. Initially overlooked due to his Spanish roots (as was Ren√© Petit), Anatol was naturalised as a French citizen in 1929 and made his national team debut on 24 March 1929 in a 2‚Äì0 victory over Portugal. He made 15 more appearances with the team and scored his only goal on 23 March 1930 in a 3‚Äì3 draw with Switzerland. The goal was scored from out. He could not take part in the 1930 FIFA World Cup due to being unable to take the required time off work, and was not selected for the France squad four years later. Athletics career Anatol was also a talented sprinter who won the 100 metres, 200 metres, 400 metres and 4 √ó 400 metres relay events at the 1923 edition of the Spanish Athletics Championships; however, as he had documentation as a French national (his father was from the French Basque Country although Manuel had lived in Spain all his life up to that point) the wins were awarded to the runners-up instead, and remain as such in the records. He subsequently competed at the 1924 Summer Olympics under the name M. A. Aristegui which may have been an administrative error due to Spanish naming customs, or a subtle attempt by him to conceal his identity from either the athletics organisers or the management at his football club. He did not progress past the opening heats of the 400 metres event.

Career =Domestic career= In May 2009, Massey-Ellis was appointed fourth official for the year's FA Women's Cup final at Derby County's Pride Park Stadium, a game which saw two injury-time goals and Arsenal defeat Sunderland 2‚Äì1. In the 2009‚Äì10 men's season Massey was fourth official in five matches and assistant referee in 11 matches. Her first appointment as an assistant referee was on 29 August 2009, a 2‚Äì2 draw between Hereford United and Port Vale. On 11 February 2010, Massey-Ellis refereed the season's FA Women's Premier League Cup final between Leeds Carnegie and Everton at Rochdale's Spotland Stadium. Massey was required to interpret two notable incidents; she disallowed a third first-half goal for Leeds for a foul on Everton's goalkeeper and disregarded Everton's late first- half appeal for a penalty kick. Leeds won the match 3‚Äì1, winning the cup for the first time since its inaugural 1991‚Äì92 season. Massey-Ellis turned professional in March 2010, joining the Professional Game Match Officials Board (PGMOB), who provide the officials for men's Premier League matches, the highest level of professional football in England. Her first Premier League appointment was on 28 December 2010, as an assistant in Blackpool's 2‚Äì0 away win at Sunderland. During a game between Cardiff City and Middlesbrough in May 2011, Massey was knocked over by Cardiff player Kevin McNaughton, although the incident was said, officially by the FA, to be an accident. In August 2011 Massey-Ellis was appointed to the Select Group of match officials. Massey- Ellis was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to football. Sexism controversy After her second Premier League game, as an assistant in Liverpool's 3‚Äì0 win at Wolverhampton Wanderers on 22 January 2011, a sexism controversy erupted over remarks made about Massey-Ellis by staff of the Premier League broadcaster Sky Sports, which led to commentator Andy Gray and presenter Richard Keys being sacked. Reporter Andy Burton was suspended. Massey-Ellis was withdrawn by the PGMOB from her next appointment, a League 2 game between Crewe Alexandra and Bradford City on 25 January, as they believed the added attention Massey might receive could detract from the match itself. The PGMOB also withdrew her for a second time, from a Conference North game between Corby Town and Eastwood Town on 29 January, with Corby stating there had been huge demand for television access when it was announced Massey was to referee the game. Massey returned to the line on 5 February for a League 2 match between Chesterfield and Aldershot Town, and was then appointed to her third Premier League fixture on 12 February between Blackpool and Aston Villa, as an assistant to Howard Webb. =International career= Massey-Ellis's early international career has included involvement in the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup by taking up the role of fourth official for England's 4‚Äì0 qualification stage win over Austria on 20 April 2006. In September 2007 Massey was assistant referee at England Women's 2‚Äì1 international friendly defeat by Denmark Women. She was also an assistant referee for the qualification stage of UEFA Women's Euro 2009. Her involvement in the qualification stage for the Women's World Cup increased for the 2011 edition of the competition, taking up the role of assistant referee for Norway's 2‚Äì0 win over Ukraine, Sweden's 1‚Äì0 away victory over the Czech Republic in Prague and Belgium's 11‚Äì0 home win over Azerbaijan. In June 2017, Massey-Ellis was appointed to be an assistant referee for the UEFA Women's Euro 2017 in the Netherlands. In May 2018 Massey- Ellis was appointed as an assistant in the 2018 UEFA Women's Champions League Final On 3 December 2018, Massey-Ellis was appointed to be an assistant referee at the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup in France.

She rose from poverty to become one of the wealthiest Texans of German ancestry in her time. She chartered the Commercial Bank of Mason in 1901, and served as its president for twenty-four years. In 1986, Recorded Texas Historic Landmark 11270 was placed at the bank, acknowledging the contributions of Anna Mebus Martin and her family. Early life Anna Henriette Mebus Martin was born December 10, 1843, near Cologne, Germany to Hewill Mebus and his wife Henriette Martin Mebus. She was the oldest of six children. Hewill Mebus lost his Solingen-based business in 1858, and the family made the decision to emigrate to Texas, where Henrietta Mebus's relatives resided. The family sailed from Germany on September 24, 1858, disembarking from the ship Iris in Galveston on December 7, 1858.December 7, 1858, Galveston Historical Foundation Immigration Database Texas The Mebus family settled at Hedwigs Hill in Mason County with Henriette's brother Louis (Ludwig) Martin. They engaged in the family business of farming and ranching. A year later, Anna Mebus married her cousin Charles Karl Martin, who ran a local store. Charles Karl Martin became postmaster on August 21, 1861, after Texas had joined the Confederate States of America. He contracted rheumatism and was an invalid by 1864. During the American Civil War, he lost the store. Anna borrowed $150 for basic staples and re-opened the store. Charles was re- appointed postmaster by the Union on April 10, 1866, to service the San Antonio‚ÄìEl Paso mail. The post office was discontinued March 17, 1868. Charles was again appointed postmaster to a re-established post office on May 18, 1874, a position he held until his 1879 death. Henriette Mebus also died the same year of 1879. Anna Martin became postmaster on December 9, 1879. When the store began to serve as a stage stop, Martin seized on the wayfarer trade by boarding horses, as well as selling homemade butter, groceries, and her own sewn creations. She bartered dry goods for cattle, preferring to cut out the middle man. Like her uncle Louis, Martin dealt in the freight business. She became a successful wool and cotton dealer. Martin was the first person in Mason County to deal in barbed wire, selling more than any other west Texas firm at the time. She eventually acquired 50,000 acres in Mason, Llano and Gillespie counties, at the time making her one of the wealthiest Texans of German ancestry. Martin established the Commercial Bank of Mason in 1901, which she ran with her two sons for twenty-four years. In 1986, Recorded Texas Historic Landmark 11270 was placed at the bank, acknowledging the contributions of Anna Mebus Martin and her family. Martin once summed it up: Personal life and death In December 1859 Anna married her cousin Charles Karl Martin, nephew of Louis Martin. The couple had two sons, Max and Charles. Anna Martin died on July 10, 1925, and is buried in the family cemetery at Hedwigs Hill. In 2011, Martin was inducted into the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame.

The term is generally used for macroscopic (visible; i.e. greater than 1 mm in size) structural units when observing soils in the field. Soil peds should be described when the soil is dry or slightly moist, as they can be difficult to distinguish when wet. There are five major classes of macrostructure seen in soils: platy, prismatic, columnar, granular, and blocky. There are also structureless conditions. Some soils have simple structure, each unit being an entity without component smaller units. Others have compound structure, in which large units are composed of smaller units separated by persistent planes of weakness. Blocky peds Types of soil structures =Platy= In platy structure, the units are flat and platelike. They are generally oriented horizontally. A special form, lenticular platy structure, is recognized for plates that are thickest in the middle and thin toward the edges. Platy structure is usually found in subsurface soils that have been subject to leaching or compaction by animals or machinery. The plates can be separated with a little effort by prying the horizontal layers with a pen knife. Platy structure tends to impede the downward movement of water and plant roots through the soil. They are found most frequently in the C, E, Bs and K horizons as well as in sesquioxides (very old soils that are rich in iron and magnesium). =Prismatic= In the prismatic structure, the individual units are bounded by flat to rounded vertical faces. Units are distinctly longer vertically, and the faces are typically casts or molds of adjoining units. Vertices are angular or subrounded; the tops of the prisms are somewhat indistinct and normally flat. Prismatic structures are characteristic of the B horizons or subsoils. The vertical cracks result from freezing and thawing and wetting and drying as well as the downward movement of water and roots. =Columnar= In the columnar structure, the units are similar to prisms and are bounded by flat or slightly rounded vertical faces. The tops of columns, in contrast to those of prisms, are very distinct and normally rounded. Columnar structure is common in the subsoil of sodium affected soils and soils rich in swelling clays such as the smectites and the kandite Halloysite. Columnar structure is very dense and it is very difficult for plant roots to penetrate these layers. Techniques such as deep plowing have help to restore some degree of fertility to these soils. =Blocky= In blocky structure, the structural units are blocklike or polyhedral. They are bounded by flat or slightly rounded surfaces that are casts of the faces of surrounding peds. Typically, blocky structural units are nearly equidimensional but grade to prisms and to plates. The structure is described as angular blocky if the faces intersect at relatively sharp angles; as subangular blocky if the faces are a mixture of rounded and plane faces and the corners are mostly rounded. Blocky structures are common in subsoil but also occur in surface soils that have a high clay content. The strongest blocky structure is formed as a result of swelling and shrinking of the clay minerals which produce cracks. Sometimes the surface of dried-up sloughs and ponds shows characteristic cracking and peeling due to clays. =Granular= In the granular structure, the structural units are approximately spherical or polyhedral and are bounded by curved or very irregular faces that are not casts of adjoining peds. In other words, they look like cookie crumbs. Granular structure is common in the surface soils of rich grasslands and highly amended garden soils with high organic matter content. Soil mineral particles are both separated and bridged by organic matter breakdown products, and soil biota exudates, making the soil easy to work. Cultivation, earthworms, frost action and rodents mix the soil and decreases the size of the peds. This structure allows for good porosity and easy movement of air and water. This combination of ease in tillage, good moisture and air handling capabilities, and good structure for planting and germination, are definitive of the phrase good tilth.

Plot Detectives Poley (William Fichtner), Frizer (Thomas Kretschmann), and Skeres (Delroy Lindo) are interrogating Ned Cruz (Antonio Banderas), a Los Angeles private investigator, who tells them that five years earlier, Russian mobster Skinny Faddeev gave $30 million in blood diamonds as an advance to Anton (Robert Maillet), a boxer, to intentionally lose a fight against his nephew. However, during the fight, Anton unintentionally killed the nephew. When Skinny was found dead, Anton was sentenced to life in prison. While Anton was in prison, he received over 200 letters from a woman named Lexie Persimmon. Anton gives Ned the job of finding Lexie. Ned is skeptical about his job, since he doesn't have a photo of Lexie. As he starts investigating the various clues, people start dying mysteriously. Ned also notices that a black Lincoln is following him, which he assumes is the Russian Mafia. He finds a clue that leads him to believe that Lexie might be in San Celeritas, New Mexico. Ned then meets a waitress named Fay Neman (Autumn Reeser)‚Äîa particle physics buff‚Äîwho helps him. Ned meets Simon (Sam Elliott), his wife Julie (Sienna Guillory), and Niels Geck (Jimmi Simpson), a physicist who is conducting an experiment for Simon. Simon is interested only in finding the \\"God particle\\" and feels indifferent when Julie tries to warm up to Ned. Ned suspects that Julie might really be Lexie and decides to tell her what is happening. Meanwhile, Anton tracks down Ned to Simon's bungalow. Ned confronts Julie with his suspicions about Lexie's true identity, but Julie has no idea what he is talking about. Ned and Julie hear gunshots, causing Ned to suspect that Anton is at the house. Realizing that he and Anton have both mistaken Julie for Lexie, Ned tries to save her. When the duo head toward the basement, Ned is astonished to find Niels dressed like a woman, and in a blonde wig. A box containing cosmetics has the phrase \\"Lex Parsimoniae\\"‚Äîa Latin phrase meaning \\"When all things are equal, the simplest solution is the best\\"‚Äîprinted on it. Ned realizes that Niels had written the letters to Anton, who becomes angered when Niels tries to convince Anton to accept him. In a shootout, Ned is injured and passes out. The story cuts back to the present day, where it is revealed that Niels and Anton killed each other while the detectives, who had followed Ned to Simon's house, held Ned and Julie hostage. Julie is kept bound and gagged with duct tape. Ned accuses the trio of following him and killing the people he met, also stating that Skinny was killed for diamonds, which his killer never recovered. Ned proves that Frizer killed all the people who could have known about the diamonds. Frizer admits his crimes, for which the other detectives scold him. Ned looks at a glass tank containing a gecko and realizes something; he tells the villains that he knows where Niels stored the diamonds. The detectives take Ned and Julie to the spot where he had confronted Julie after she had shown him a hidden shoe box. While Julie and Ned are in the car, Skeres and Frizer go to get the shoe box. Meanwhile, Poley spots Julie and Ned signaling each other. He attacks them, but they overpower him and manage to drive the car towards Skeres and Frizer. Skeres and Frizer are disappointed when they discover the diamonds are not in the box. When they see the car coming towards them, they realize what is happening and start shooting. Ned shoots them both dead. Meanwhile, Simon the physicist's experiment destroys his lab and creates a giant crevasse. Ned and Julie speed away in the car, and later pick up Fay.

Opened in 1886, it forms part of the Civitanova‚ÄìFabriano railway. The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). However, the commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni. Train services are operated by Trenitalia. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company. Location Macerata railway station is situated at Piazza XXX Aprile, to the south of the city centre. History The station was opened on 22 May 1886, upon the inauguration of the Corridonia‚ÄìMacerata section of the Civitanova‚ÄìFabriano railway. On 24 December 1888, the station became a through station, when the final section of the Civitanova‚ÄìFabriano railway was completed, between Macerata and San Severino Marche. Features =Passenger Building= Macerata's passenger building is a two-storey structure, made up of three sections. The ground floor of the central section houses services for passengers, such as the ticket office and waiting room. The first floor is not accessible to the public. Extending laterally from the central section are two symmetrical single storey wings, with facilities including a bar and a newsstand. The station was recently renovated at a total cost of ‚Ç¨300,000. The renovations included: alterations to the platforms to bring them up to the metropolitan standard (height 55 cm), making boarding easier and more comfortable; new flooring on the platforms and in the booking hall; maintenance to the ceilings and windows; an improved interior lighting system and integration of a new lighting system outside; upholstery cleaning; restoration of the facade; alterations to existing technology systems; installation of tactile paving for the vision impaired; renovation of toilets and the construction of a glass canopy to protect access to them. =Station yard= The station yard consists of three tracks used for passenger services. Each is equipped with a platform, but only one platform is covered by a canopy. The tracks are connected by a pedestrian underpass. Track 1 is used for overtaking or passing between trains, which happens quite often, because the station is located on a single track line. Track 2 is for stops by through trains, and track 3 is used for trains originating or terminating in Macerata. There are two other detached buildings, both double storey and used for the passenger services, on the other side of the tracks from the passenger building. The station has a large goods yard with a goods shed adjoining the loading bay of track 1. Its design is very similar to those of other Italian stations: a long rectangular building, in brick with a sloping roof. There are no longer any goods services to the station, so the goods shed has been converted into a bus terminal. Passenger and train movements The station has about 900,000 passenger movements each year. Only regional trains stop at the station. Their main origins and destinations are Ancona, Ascoli Piceno, Civitanova and Fabriano. Interchange The station has a bus terminal for urban and suburban buses.

Etymology of the word thrill comes from English root meaning ‚Äúto pierce‚Äù. A thrill is a sharp sensation. A good thriller provides entertainment by making viewers uncomfortable with moments of suspense, the heightened feeling of anxiety and fright. It makes persons sit on the edge of their seats. A thriller is more a familiar concept and description than a pure genre. It is not a genre with a precise definition. It can vary from comedy and melodrama to adventure and romance. All thrillers are a combination of different genres. The basic thriller trait of suspense, fits with some genres better than with others. For example, crime, sci-fi and romance allow more scope for suspense than screwball comedies or musicals do. Romantic thriller in discussion of genres, is more a metagenre that merges two or more genres together. It is different from established and historically specific cinema movements like Gothic horror or Golden Age detective. (thrillers pp. 260 261) A genre works on two levels. First a specific theme exists. Then general relationships, patterns and structural elements are interwoven to the specific theme. This is why there can be a large variety of visual styles and story structures in romantic thriller. History Notrthrop Frye's Anatomy of Criticism (1957) suggested four archetypal categories in literature; comedy, romance, tragedy and irony or satire. In a romance the hero is like us, only slightly superior to others and can behave in remarkable ways, in a world where ‚Äòordinary laws of nature are slightly suspended'. The common element in a romantic plot is adventure. There is an adventure or quest where the hero faces ordeals or monsters. There is often a sense of two worlds, the mundane reality and the unknown mysterious. The concept of a maze is seen in romantic thrillers, where the exit or solution is not easily navigated. It‚Äôs similar to a metaphor for a journey with blind spots and false turns where some things are hidden. In the 1935 release of Thirty-Nine Steps , character Richard Hannay leaves a theatre with a mysterious and attractive woman, they begin a romance adventure journey into the world of spies, double agents and espionage. Author John Buchan was a pioneer of spy thrillers, adding romance and adventure traditions into the then new context of political conflict. The possibility of romance between the mysterious woman, and a decent gentleman was only a minor consideration to Alfred Hitchcock‚Äôs adaptation. Based on Raymond Chandler‚Äôs First Detective Marlowe novel, The Big Sleep 1946 with Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, demonstrates the two romantic thriller elements of adventure and dual worlds. The main heroes are brought together in an attempt to save Bacall‚Äôs younger sister Vickers. The main adventure sleuth plot has the characters traveling both together and separately. In a common theme, they are from different social worlds, and wouldn‚Äôt usually mix. Romance between the two seems hopeless. Parallel to the adventure story unfolding, the romance travels its own labyrinth of truth and deception, to finally overcome issues of mistrust. The story can be summarised as a private detective working for a rich family, investigates a complex case including murder and blackmail while possibly falling in love. Raymond Chandlers‚Äô Marlowe character was described as ‚Äòa knight in dark armor rescuing a lady‚Äô. Film adaptations of the novels varied according to the Directors and Producers and their interpretation of the character, using certain traits more than others to tell their story. In a similar way, there is a variety of styles in the adaptations of the James Bond character. Where Marlowe romanced with quick banter with sexual overtones, Bond seduces in a more physical style. =Films= Opinions vary on what films are in this category. This is only a guide.

He painted both portraits and landscapes although he was employed as a high-school teacher.\\"Lang, Dominique\\", Luxemburger Lexikon, Editions Guy Binsfeld, Luxembourg, 2006. Career After completing his studies in 1901, he embarked on a Pre- Raphaelite phase when he painted the Baptism of Christ, a fresco in the church at Junglinster followed by paintings for the stations of the cross in the new church at Dudelange. Travelling on a State grant, he then spent four months studying art in Florence and Rome. Back in Dudelange, he faced not just financial problems but negative criticism of his paintings from the Cercle artistique de Luxembourg. He began to suffer from dreadful headaches, leading him into depression. His art was influenced by his reading Ruskin, Schopenhauer and Spengler, leading him into a Symbolist period where his work resembled that of the English Pre-Raphaelites who reacted against mechanisation by evoking the legends of the Middle Ages. His paintings La jeune fille et la mort and La mort entrant dans la maison are from this period. During this period, he left the family home and set up a studio in a poorer area of Dudelange.\\"Dominique Lang (1874-1919)\\" , Centre de Documentation sur les Migrations Humaines. Retrieved 22 January 2011. After a few months in Paris (1905), Lang was admitted to the Munich Academy in March 1906 where he studied contemporary art and Impressionism (from 1907) which had a drastic effect on his painting style.Georgette Bisdorff, \\"Dominique Lang\\", La Collection Luxembourgeoise du Mus√©e National d'Histoire et d'Art, Ons stad, No 68, 2001. Retrieved 22 January 2011. When he returned to Dudelange, he opened a photographic studio which finally provided him with a reasonable income. In 1911, he married Anne-Marie Ney in 1911, who would appear in many of his paintings, and the same year he started to work as an art teacher. He first taught at the Lyc√©e des Filles in Luxembourg City and then at the Ecole industrielle et commerciale in Esch-sur-Alzette. Unable to make a living from his paintings, for which he received little recognition during his lifetime, Lang had to remain a teacher for the rest of his working life. His paintings were increasingly Impressionist, full of ever brighter light and often depicting a young woman clothed in white. Using short brush strokes, he would make abundant use of blues and greens. Then, in 1912‚Äì13, he began to adopt the pure colouring favoured by Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Camille Pissarro. Around this time, he began to venture out along the banks of the River Alzette painting scenes of orchards, flower picking, and fruit harvesting or of the peasant's houses in the area where he lived. His painting of Dudelange en 1917 is an illustration of his characteristic aversion to industrialization. There is no sight of factories or workmen's housing in the idyllic countryside surrounding the town. The final period in Lang's life was once again one of increasing pessimism and distress as he suffered from severe migraines and almost total blindness. He was 45 when he died in Schifflange on 22 June 1919, and was buried in his native Dudelange. Affiliations and awards Lang was a member of the Cercle Artistique de Luxembourg where he exhibited his paintings. In 1904 and 1919, he was awarded the Grand-Duc Adolphe Prize.

It was a common business practice in the 18th century book trade in Germany. The publisher offered to sell a book that was planned but had not yet been printed, usually at a discount, so as to cover their costs in advance. The business practice was particularly common with magazines, helping to determine in advance how many subscribers there would be. For example, when Johann Heinrich Zedler decided to issue a collection of works of Martin Luther he advertised that the book would be for sale through praenumeration at the Leipzig Easter Fair in 1728, with the first volume to be available at the following Michaelmas Fair in early October. When the eleventh and final volume was issued in 1733, Zedler found himself in difficulty. He had been using praenumeration payments for the future volumes to pay the bills for previous volumes, and now the last bills were due with no future payments to cover them.

Ferguson served as a community liaison on educational issues for the president of the Baltimore City Council from 2005 to 2006. From 2009 to 2010, he was a special assistant to Andres Alonso, the chief executive officer of Baltimore City Public Schools. He graduated magna cum laude from the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law with a Juris Doctor in 2010. Political career In 2010, Ferguson challenged six-term incumbent George W. Della, Jr. for the Democratic nomination for the 46th district in the Maryland Senate. He won the primary election by a margin of 59-41%. Running in a heavily Democratic district, he won the general election with no formal opposition, receiving 98% of the vote. He is the youngest state senator ever elected in Maryland. His youth earned him the nickname of \\"Baby Senator\\". On October 24, 2019, Senate Democrats unanimously voted to nominate Ferguson to succeed Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller. Ferguson was perceived as more progressive than Miller. He was sworn in as Senate President on January 8, 2020.

Life  Brentano was a son of the Hessian Interior and Justice Minister Otto von Brentano di Tremezzo and a brother of Clemens and Heinrich von Brentano. His mother, Lilla Beata n√©e Schwerdt stems from the Frankfurt line of the Brentanos. In contrast to his brothers, Bernard von Brentano hardly used the full name of his family, Brentano di Tremezzo. Brentano studied philosophy in Freiburg, Munich, Frankfurt and Berlin. In Frankfurt, he became an active member of the catholic student association Bavaria. In Munich he was a member of the K. St. V. Rheno-Bavaria. Brentano became a member of the PEN-Club in 1920. From 1925 to 1930 he worked in the Berlin office of the Frankfurter Zeitung, where he became the successor of Joseph Roth. He was also involved in the Association of proletarian revolutionary writers and worked for the Communist literary magazine Die Linkskurve. A KPD member, he later left the party and distanced himself from politics after some trips to Moscow and because of the party's Stalinist tendencies. Together with Berthold Brecht and Herbert Ihering he planned to edit the magazine \\"Krisis und Kritik\\", which, however, never appeared. In 1933, he emigrated to Switzerland and his family lived in K√ºsnacht in Zurich. In 1949, he returned from exile back to Germany.

He is known for causing a military disaster in a siege of Nisibis (573), early in the Roman‚ÄìPersian War of 572‚Äì591.Martindale, Jones & Morris (1992), p. 9-10  Siege of Nisibis  =John of Epiphania= Acacius is first mentioned by name in the work of John of Epiphania. He was reportedly sent by Justin II to dismiss Marcian, the magister militum per Orientem, from office. Acacius dutifully did so, preventing Marcian from concluding the siege of Nisibis. The leaderless Byzantine troops retreated. After the winter season, Marcian gathered together his forces again and set out from Dara meeting with the barbarians in front of the city of Nisibis led by Varaman, who was in command of the companies stationed them. A fierce battle followed in which the Romans turned the barbarians to flight vigorously near the Persian place called Sarmathon, bringing down many of them. Then making an attempt at the fortress of Thebython where they spent ten days. Unable to seize it, they returned to the city of Dara while it was still spring and again invaded enemy land planning to besiege Nisibis with the approval of the emperor Justin.\\" John of Epiphania, fragment 3 \\"While they were encamped near the city, King Chosro√´s set out from Babylon with an army of Medians crossing the Tigris River and passing over empty land, as the Roman had not heard of the king‚Äòs movements, and came upon the Persian fortress of Amvaron (it is five days distant from the city of Circesion), where he dispatched Adaarman, as the general was called, to cross the Euphrates River there and plunder Roman territory with thousands of his own Medians and nomadic barbarians. At the same time, he urged Avorras on to the Romans besieging Nisibis. When Adaarman reached the city of Circesion, he crossed the Euphrates and began to forage Roman lands without any restraint. For due to the previous peace and quiet that they had enjoyed during the reign of Justinian, their war time preparation had receded and their virility completely vanished. As no one dared to come to blows with the barbarians, Adaarman was able to come as far as the city of Antioch ravaging the sites and fields near the city and then advancing on Coele Syria. He made camp not far from the great city of Apamea, to whose citizens‚Äô embassies he promised to enter the city and leave it unharmed, but then actually entering it where the Persians seized their possessions, enslaved its inhabitants, and put the entire city to the flame then returning in all haste to their own land. As a result of these actions, the emperor Justin dispatched Acacius (the Romans are accustomed to add the name of Archelaus) removing Marcian, who was still besieging Nisibis, from office because he had doubts about his loyalty, as the city had not yet been taken control of. ... As the Romans were retreating.\\" John of Epiphania, fragments 4-5 =John of Ephesus= John of Ephesus gives a similar account, but gives more attention to the contact of Acacius and the reactions of the soldiers: \\"The illustrious Patrician Marcian, a relative of king Justin, was sent by him to command one of the Roman armies in the east; and being warmly zealous for the polity of the Christians, he assembled an army, and laid siege to Nisibis, the frontier town and bulwark of Mesopotamia, and then in possession of the Persians. And having strongly invested it, and constructed round it a palisade, he commenced, with the aid of the skilful mechanicians whom he had brought with him, to erect more scientific works, consisting of lofty towers and strong covered approaches. And the city began to be distressed, and both its inhabitants and the Persian garrison despaired of their lives when they saw it so hard pressed by the Romans. And as those inside were in alarm, so those outside were making their preparations to assault the city and plunder it; but just as they were ready to storm it, a violent tempered man arrived, named Acacius Archelaus, sent for no just reason by king Justin to deprive Marcian of his command, and cut his girdle and send him away from the cast.\\" John of Ephesus, Book 6. Chapter 2 And immediately that he came, he [Acacius] showed his orders, just at the time when Marcian and his army were fighting against Nisibis, and expecting to assault it the next day, and win the city; and all were in astonishment, and their hands were weakened. And the illustrious Marcian, who had been assiduously making his preparations, and was upon the point of capturing Nisibis, on hearing the orders, said to Acacius, 'You see how great labour we have taken for the purpose of capturing this city; and now, wait a little, and grant us a delay of two days only, and then do what you have been commanded; for the king has a right that what he orders should be done.' But he [Acacius] was angry with him [Marcianus], and insulted him, and in hot wrath laid hands upon him in the presence of all his officers, and pulled him about, and threw him down, and cut his girdle, scoffing at him, and even, as was said, he struck him on the cheek. And the whole army was indignant, and their hands weakened, and execrating the wickedness which had been done before their eyes, they lowered their standard, and turned it upside down. And thereupon the whole army fled, and left the city far behind them, and loud was their grief and lamentation at what had happened to their commander; for he was a good man and a believer: and besides, at the very time when they were expecting to enter and take the city, they had shown their backs when there was no enemy who pursued them, and had become the laughter and scorn of their foes.\\" \\"And when the Persian army which garrisoned the city saw the breaking up and sadden retreat of the Romans, and Marcian's standard overthrown, they were astonished, and encouraged one another, and armed and pursued after them, and fell upon a body of infantry which remained behind, and defeated and slew most of them, and so returned to the city, laughing and mocking at what had happened to the Romans of their own selves. Forthwith, too, they wrote and informed their king of all these things, saying, 'Come, immediately, and let us cross over into the Roman territory; for our noble gods, the sun and fire, have made them, by the commandment of their king, fall upon one another; and they have dismissed Marcian with scorn, and have all fled and gone away from our city.' \\" =Evagrius Scholasticus= Evagrius Scholasticus gives his own take on the matter: placing the blame on Justin himself, on Marcianus and on Acacius : \\"The emperor sends out his kinsman Marcian, as commander of the forces of the East, without, however, sufficiently supplying him with troops, or the other material of war. He occupies Mesopotamia, at the imminent risk of utter ruin, followed by very few troops, and these imperfectly armed, and by a few rustic labourers and herdsmen, whom he had pressed into his service from among the provincials. After gaining the advantage in some skirmishes near Nisibis with the Persians, who were themselves not yet completely prepared, he sits down before that city, though the enemy did not think it necessary to close the gates, and insolently jeered the Roman troops. Besides many other prodigies presaging the approaching calamities, I also saw, at the beginning of the war, a newly born calf with two heads.\\" Evagrius Scholasticus, Book 5. Chapters 8-9 \\"Chosroes, when his preparations for war were completed, having accompanied Adaarmanes for some distance, sent him across the Euphrates from his own bank of the river into the Roman territory, by Circesium, a city most important to the Romans, situated at the limit of the empire, and rendered strong not only by its walls, which are carried to an immense height, but by the rivers Euphrates and Aboras, which, as it were, insulate the place. Chosroes himself, having crossed the Tigris with his own division of the army, advanced upon Nisibis. Of these operations the Romans were for a long time ignorant, so far that Justin, relying on a rumour to the effect that Chosroes was either dead or approaching his last breath, was indignant at the tardiness of the siege of Nisibis, and sent persons for the purpose of stimulating the efforts of Marcian, and bringing to him the keys of the gates as quickly as possible. Information, however, that the siege was making no progress, but that the commander was bringing great discredit upon himself by attempting impossibilities in the case of so important a city with so contemptible a force, is conveyed in the first instance to Gregory, bishop of Theopolis.\\" \\"For the bishop of Nisibis, being strongly attached to Gregory, as having received munificent presents from him, and especially being indignant at the insolence which the Persians were continually displaying towards the Christians, and desirous that his city should be subject to the Roman power, supplied information to Gregory of all things that were going on in the enemy's territory, at each several juncture. This the latter immediately forwarded to Justin, informing him as quickly as possible of the advance of Chosroes: but he, being immersed in his habitual pleasures, paid no regard to the letters of Gregory; nor was he indeed inclined to believe them, indulging rather the thoughts suggested by his wishes: for the ordinary mark of dissolute persons is a meanness of spirit combined with confidence with regard to results; as well as incredulity, if any thing occurs which runs counter to their desires. Accordingly he writes to Gregory, altogether repudiating the information as being utterly false, and, even supposing it were true, saying that the Persians would not come up before the siege was concluded, and that, if they did, they would be beaten off with loss. He further sends Acacius, a wicked and insolent man, to Marcian with orders to supersede him in the command, even supposing he had already set one foot within the town. This command he strictly executed, carrying out the emperor's orders without any regard to the public good: for, on his arrival at the camp, he deprives Marcian of his command while on the enemy's territory, and without informing the army of the transaction. The various officers, on learning at the break of the next clay that their commander was superseded, no longer appeared at the head of their troops, but stole away in various directions, and thus raised that ridiculous siege.\\" =Later accounts= Theophylact Simocatta, Theophanes the Confessor, Michael the Syrian, the Chronicle of 1234, Bar- Hebraeus, and Nikephoros Kallistos Xanthopoulos give derivative accounts. Theophanes, Nikephoros, the Chronicle and Bar-Hebraeus conclude that Acacius replaced Marcianus as magister militum per Orientem. While this could be a valid interpretation of the primary sources, it contradicts Theophanes of Byzantium. The latter has Marcianus succeeded by Theodore Tzirus. Michael Whitby simply observes: \\"It is unclear whether Acacius Archelaus was sent out to replace Marcian, or merely to announce his replacement by Theodore Tzirus, son of Justinian, whom Theophanes Byzantinus names as the new general.\\" Whitby (1988), p. 258 The rank of Acacius is never clarified in primary sources. The Chronicle of 1234 is the only source to call him a tribune. The Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire considers it likely that Acacius was one of the scribones, often employed on important missions.

Hyperelliptic curves exist for every genus g \\\\geq 1. The general formula of Hyperelliptic curve over a finite field K is given by :C : y^2 + h(x) y = f(x) \\\\in K[x,y] where h(x), f(x) \\\\in K satisfy certain conditions. There are two types of hyperelliptic curves: real hyperelliptic curves and imaginary hyperelliptic curves which differ by the number of points at infinity. In this page, we describe more about real hyperelliptic curves, these are curves having two points at infinity while imaginary hyperelliptic curves have one point at infinity. Definition A real hyperelliptic curve of genus g over K is defined by an equation of the form C:y^2+h(x)y=f(x) where h(x) \\\\in K has degree not larger than g+1 while f(x) \\\\in K must have degree 2g+1 or 2g+2. This curve is a non singular curve where no point (x,y) in the algebraic closure of K satisfies the curve equation y^2+h(x)y=f(x) and both partial derivative equations: 2y+h(x)=0 and h'(x)y=f'(x). The set of (finite) K‚Äìrational points on C is given by :C(K) = \\\\\\\\{ (a,b) \\\\in K^2  b^2 + h(a) b = f(a) \\\\\\\\} \\\\cup S Where S is the set of points at infinity. For real hyperelliptic curves, there are two points at infinity, \\\\infty_1 and \\\\infty_2. For any point P(a,b)\\\\in C(K), the opposite point of P is given by \\\\overline{P} = (a, -b-h); it is the other point with x-coordinate a that also lies on the curve. Example Let C: y^2=f(x) where : f(x)=x^6+3x^5-5x^4-15x^3+4x^2+12x=x(x-1)(x-2)(x+1)(x+2)(x+3) \\\\, over R. Since \\\\deg f(x) = 2g+2 and f(x) has degree 6, thus C is a curve of genus g = 2. The homogeneous version of the curve equation is given by : Y^2Z^4=X^6+3X^5Z-5X^4Z^2-15X^3Z^3+4X^2Z^4+12XZ^5. It has a single point at infinity given by (0:1:0) but this point is singular. The blowup of C has 2 different points at infinity, which we denote \\\\infty_1 and \\\\infty_2 . Hence this curve is an example of a real hyperelliptic curve. In general, every curve given by an equation where f has even degree has two points at infinity and is a real hyperelliptic curve while those where f has odd degree have only a single point in the blowup over (0:1:0) and are thus imaginary hyperelliptic curves. In both cases this assumes that the affine part of the curve is nonsingular (see the conditions on the derivatives above) Arithmetic in a real hyperelliptic curve In real hyperelliptic curve, addition is no longer defined on points as in elliptic curves but on divisors and the Jacobian. Let C be a hyperelliptic curve of genus g over a finite field K. A divisor D on C is a formal finite sum of points P on C. We write :D = \\\\sum_{P \\\\in C}{n_P P} where n_P \\\\in\\\\Z and n_p=0 for almost all P. The degree of D= \\\\sum_{P \\\\in C}{n_P P} is defined by :\\\\deg(D) = \\\\sum_{P \\\\in C}{n_P} . D is said to be defined over K if D^\\\\sigma=\\\\sum_{P \\\\in C}n_P P^\\\\sigma=D for all automorphisms œÉ of \\\\overline{K} over K . The set Div(K) of divisors of C defined over K forms an additive abelian group under the addition rule :\\\\sum a_PP + \\\\sum b_PP = \\\\sum {(a_P + b_P) P}. The set Div^0 (K) of all degree zero divisors of C defined over K is a subgroup of Div(K). We take an example: Let D_1=6P_1+ 4P_2 and D_2=1P_1+ 5P_2. If we add them then D_1+ D_2=7P_1+ 9P_2. The degree of D_1 is \\\\deg(D_1)=6+4=10 and the degree of D_2 is \\\\deg(D_2)=1+5=6. Then, \\\\deg(D_1+D_2)=deg(D_1)+deg(D_2)=16. For polynomials G\\\\in K[C], the divisor of G is defined by : \\\\mathrm{div}(G)=\\\\sum_{P\\\\in C} {\\\\mathrm{ord}}_P(G)P. If the function G has a pole at a point P then -{\\\\mathrm{ord}}_P (G) is the order of vanishing of G at P. Assume G, H are polynomials in K[C]; the divisor of the rational function F=G/H is called a principal divisor and is defined by \\\\mathrm{div}(F)=\\\\mathrm{div}(G)-\\\\mathrm{div}(H). We denote the group of principal divisors by P(K), i.e. P(K)={\\\\mathrm{div}(F)F \\\\in K(C)}. The Jacobian of C over K is defined by J=Div^0/P. The factor group J is also called the divisor class group of C. The elements which are defined over K form the group J(K). We denote by \\\\overline{D}\\\\in J(K) the class of D in Div^0 (K)/P(K). There are two canonical ways of representing divisor classes for real hyperelliptic curves C which have two points infinity S=\\\\\\\\{\\\\infty_1,\\\\infty_2 \\\\\\\\}. The first one is to represent a degree zero divisor by \\\\bar{D} such that D=\\\\sum_{i=1}^r P_i-r\\\\infty_2, where P_i \\\\in C(\\\\bar{\\\\mathbb{F}}_q),P_i ot= \\\\infty_2, and P_i ot=\\\\bar{P_j} if i ot=j The representative D of \\\\bar{D} is then called semi reduced. If D satisfies the additional condition r \\\\leq g then the representative D is called reduced. Notice that P_i=\\\\infty_1 is allowed for some i. It follows that every degree 0 divisor class contain a unique representative \\\\bar{D} with :D= D_x-deg(D_x ) \\\\infty_2+v_1 (D)(\\\\infty_1-\\\\infty_2), where D_x is divisor that is coprime with both :\\\\infty_1 and \\\\infty_2, and 0\\\\leq deg(D_x )+v_1(D)\\\\leq g. The other representation is balanced at infinity. Let D_\\\\infty=\\\\infty_1+\\\\infty_2 , note that this divisor is K-rational even if the points \\\\infty_1 and \\\\infty_2 are not independently so. Write the representative of the class \\\\bar{D} as D=D_1+D_\\\\infty, where D_1 is called the affine part and does not contain \\\\infty_1 and \\\\infty_2, and let d=\\\\deg(D_1). If d is even then : D_\\\\infty= \\\\frac{d}{2}(\\\\infty_1+\\\\infty_2). If d is odd then :D_\\\\infty= \\\\frac{d+1}{2} \\\\infty_1+\\\\frac{d-1}{2} \\\\infty_2. For example, let the affine parts of two divisors be given by :D_1=6P_1+ 4P_2 and D_2=1P_1+ 5P_2 then the balanced divisors are :D_1=6P_1+ 4P_2- 5D_{\\\\infty_1} -5D_{\\\\infty_2} and D_2=1P_1+ 5P_2- 3D_{\\\\infty_1} -3D_{\\\\infty_2} Transformation from real hyperelliptic curve to imaginary hyperelliptic curve Let C be a real quadratic curve over a field K. If there exists a ramified prime divisor of degree 1 in K then we are able to perform a birational transformation to an imaginary quadratic curve. A (finite or infinite) point is said to be ramified if it is equal to its own opposite. It means that P =(a,b) = \\\\overline{P}=(a, -b-h(a)), i.e. that h(a)+ 2b=0. If P is ramified then D=P-\\\\infty_1 is a ramified prime divisor. The real hyperelliptic curve C:y^2+h(x)y=f(x) of genus g with a ramified K-rational finite point P=(a,b) is birationally equivalent to an imaginary model C':y'^2+\\\\bar{h}(x')y'=\\\\bar{f}(x') of genus g, i.e. \\\\deg(\\\\bar{f})=2g+1 and the function fields are equal K(C)=K(C'). Here: : x'= \\\\frac{1}{x-a} and y'= \\\\frac{y+b}{(x-a)^{g+1}} ‚Ä¶ (i) In our example C: y^2=f(x) where f(x)=x^6+3x^5-5x^4-15x^3+4x^2+12x, h(x) is equal to 0. For any point P=(a,b), h(a) is equal to 0 and so the requirement for P to be ramified becomes b=0. Substituting h(a) and b, we obtain f(a)=0, where f(a)=a(a-1)(a-2)(a+1)(a+2)(a+3), i.e. a\\\\in\\\\\\\\{0,1,2,-1,-2,-3\\\\\\\\}. From (i), we obtain x= \\\\frac {ax'+1}{x'} and y= \\\\frac{y'}{x'^{g+1}} . For g=2, we have y= \\\\frac{y'}{x'^3} For example, let a=1 then x= \\\\frac{x'+1}{x'} and y= \\\\frac{y'}{x'^3} , we obtain :\\\\left(\\\\frac{y'}{x'^3 }\\\\right)^2=\\\\frac {x'+1}{x'} \\\\left(\\\\frac {x'+1}{x'}+1\\\\right)\\\\left(\\\\frac {x'+1}{x'}+2\\\\right)\\\\left(\\\\frac {x'+1}{x'}+3\\\\right)\\\\left(\\\\frac {x'+1}{x'}-1\\\\right)\\\\left(\\\\frac {x'+1}{x'}-2\\\\right). To remove the denominators this expression is multiplied by x^6, then: : y'^2=(x'+1)(2x'+1)(3x'+1)(4x'+1)(1)(1-x') \\\\, giving the curve :C' : y'^2=\\\\bar{f}(x') where \\\\bar{f}(x')=(x'+1)(2x'+1)(3x'+1)(4x'+1)(1)(1-x')= -24x'^5-26x'^4+15x'^3+25x'^2+9x'+1 . C' is an imaginary quadratic curve since \\\\bar{f}(x') has degree 2g+1.

Four years later, at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, Still and his partner, Glenn Florio, competed but did not make it past the heats in the men's double sculls event. After transferring from Humboldt State University to UCLA in the fall of 1980, Still began rowing during his junior year. Still and his UCLA teammates finished 5th at the 1983 Intercollegiate Rowing Association regatta in the men's eight+. He graduated from UCLA in 1983. In the summer of 1983, Still was selected to his first US National Rowing Team. At the 1983 World Rowing Championships in Duisburg, Still competed in the coxless four event with Robert Espeseth, Michael Bach, and Kevin Proctor and finished 6th. In 1984, his fourth competitive season, Still was selected for the first of 2 Olympic teams that he would participate in as mentioned previously. At the 1985 World Rowing Championships in Hazewinkel, Still sat in seat 6 of the American men's eight+ and finished in 3rd place, 1 second from 1st place. At the 1986 World Rowing Championships in Nottingham, Still, sitting in seat 7, was a part of the American men's eight+ team that finished in 3rd place. Following the World Championships, Still competed at the 1986 Goodwill Games in Moscow, and won a gold medal as a part of the men's eight+ team. In 1987, Still sat in seat 3 of the American coxed four team at the World Rowing Championships in Copenhagen, but the team had difficulty with the boat's rudder in the semifinals and they did not qualify for the final. Still participated in the Olympic Job Opportunities program in 1987, and landed a training position at Johnson & Higgins (now Marsh & McLennan Companies). Still continues to work at Marsh USA as an SVP in its Japan Client Services unit in NYC.

As of November 2019, CraftWorks owned and operated over 390 restaurants in the United States, but all of its owned-and-operated locations closed by March 2020, after a Chapter 11 bankruptcy followed immediately by the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, and CraftWorks and terminated its 18,000 employees, leaving fewer than 25 employed. On June 12, 2020, SPB Hospitality purchased Craftworks businesses out of bankruptcy for $93 million. History  In 1976, the first Old Chicago taphouse opened in Boulder, Colorado. The first Gordon Biersch Brewery Restaurant was opened in Palo Alto, California on July 6, 1988. The first Rock Bottom restaurant opened in Denver, Colorado in 1991. In 1993, Big River Breweries opened its first location in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Rock Bottom Restaurants, Inc., made an initial public offering in 1994. In 1995, the first ChopHouse opened in Denver, Colorado. Big River Breweries opened the only brewpub at Walt Disney World in 1996. A private management buyout took Rock Bottom Restaurants, Inc. private in 1999. In the same year, Gordon Biersch was acquired by Big River Breweries. In 2000, Rock Bottom Restaurants formed the Rock Bottom Foundation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit entity. Rock Bottom Restaurants laid off about 20% of its corporate staff in 2007 and slowed its growth plans along with ceasing its search for an equity partner. In 2010, Rock Bottom Restaurants and Gordon Biersch Brewery Restaurant Group were acquired by Centerbridge Capital Partners and merged to form CraftWorks Restaurants and Breweries, Inc. On November 1, 2018, CraftWorks announced that it had acquired Logan's Roadhouse and formed Craftworks Holdings. Logan's Roadhouse is a chain of restaurants founded in 1991 in Lexington, Kentucky. The chain's menu includes mesquite-grilled steaks, traditional American fare (sandwiches, soup, salads, and seafood), ice-cold longneck beer, homemade yeast rolls, and unlimited buckets of in-shell peanuts. On June 12, 2020, Craftworks was purchased by SPB Hospitality for $93 million. SPB Hospitality is an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group. =Bankruptcy= On March 3, 2020 CraftWorks filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. At the same time, the company entered into an agreement with affiliates of Fortress Credit Co. LLC, its senior lenders, to sell the company for at least $138 million, plus the assumption of certain liabilities, CraftWorks said in a news release. However, Fortress Credit later withdrew a $23 million loan for continuing operations; it then agreed to fund $6 million to finance continuing operations, and on April 1, 2020, CraftWorks terminated nearly all 18,000 of their employees and terminated health care benefits as of March 31, 2020.

The role played by Marshals is similar to that of campus police, however they are not law enforcement officials. They intervene in instances of misconduct and breakdown of law and order and report the incident to the police. Each university has a Chief Marshal heading its marshals with the assistance of a Deputy Chief Marshal. The appointment of Marshals are done by the University Act.Kotte Campus Vice Chancellor denies students‚Äô charges History The units of Marshals were formed in the campuses of the University of Ceylon and thereafter continued in the University of Sri Lanka. They were units responsible for maintaining student discipline on instructions of the vice-chancellor and the senior faculty and providing security for university students and property. They did not carry firearms and law enforcement within the university was provided by the police. After the University of Ceylon was dissolved, its former campuses became independent universities and maintained the Marshals units. These were dropped in the 1980s and replaced by private security guards who did not have the authority to maintain student discipline. Subsequently, clashes between student groups and ragging resulting in student deaths were blamed on the lack of disciplinary or actual control applied by the security guards. In recent years units of Marshals were re-instituted in several universities.Marshals back in universities, Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Universities with Marshals *University of Ceylon (dissolved in 1972 to establish the University of Sri Lanka.) *University of Sri Lanka (dissolved in 1978) *University of Colombo (Western Province) *University of Peradeniya (Central Province) *University of Sri Jayewardenepura (Western Province) *University of Kelaniya (Western Province) *University of Moratuwa (Western Province) *University of Jaffna (Northern Province) *University of Ruhuna (Southern Province) *Eastern University, Sri Lanka (Eastern Province) Ranks *Chief Marshal *Deputy Chief Marshal *Marshal (Grade I) *Marshal (Grade II) Uniform Marshal's ware a dark blue uniform with a peak cap in the style of police uniforms.

Life Cogan was born at Rothwell, Northamptonshire, the son of John Cogan, a surgeon, then 64 years old. The father, who survived until 1784, and was the author of An Essay on the Epistle to the Romans and of other anonymous pieces, married twice; by his first wife he had a son Thomas Cogan the physician, and by the second he was the father of Eliezer. The boy studied Latin grammar before he was six years old. For six months he was placed at Market Harborough in the school of Stephen Addington, but his early life was mainly passed under his father's roof, and he was self-taught in the rudiments of Greek. To complete his education he was sent to Daventry Academy, where he was for six years, three as pupil and three as assistant tutor, under Thomas Belsham. At this time there were about 50 pupils, many known in later life as Unitarians. When John Kenrick moved from Daventry to Exeter in 1784, his place was taken by Cogan, who thus became Belsham's colleague. In the autumn of 1787 Cogan was elected as minister of Presbyterian congregation at Cirencester, and continued in that position until 1789. During this period of his life he printed for his friends, though he did not publish, a Fragment on Philosophical Necessity. On 21 September 1790 he married Mary, the daughter of David Atchison of Weedon, and in the following July he settled for a short time at Ware in Hertfordshire, but after a few months he moved first to Enfield and then to Cheshunt. Cogan was elected minister of the chapel in Crossbrook Street, Cheshunt, in 1800, and in January of the following year he was also appointed by the dissenting congregation at Walthamstow. During that year he preached alternately there and at Cheshunt, but then he transferred his school from Cheshunt to Higham Hill, Walthamstow, and ministered only to the congregation there. His school soon became known, and among his pupils were Samuel Sharpe, the Egyptologist and translator of the Bible, Benjamin Disraeli (of whom he used to say, \\"I don't like Disraeli; I never could get him to understand the subjunctive\\"), Milner Gibson, Russell Gurney, Lord Stone, inventor Sir Francis Ronalds, and Peter Finch Martineau's sons. He preached his farewell sermon at Walthamstow on the last Sunday 1816, and in 1828 retired from teaching into private life. His portrait in life-size was painted at the cost of his pupils by Thomas Phillips, R.A., and engraved by Samuel Cousins, and the picture was presented to him at a dinner at the Albion tavern on 20 December 1828. He died at Higham Hill on 21 January 1855, and was buried on 27 January in a vault in the burial-ground at the Gravel Pit Chapel, Hackney, which contained his wife's remains. She died on 1 December 1850, aged 81. Works Cogan had a reputation as a Greek scholar. In the section of Porsoniana appended to Alexander Dyce's Table-talk of Samuel Rogers, p. 302, occurs the anecdote that when Richard Porson was introduced to Cogan with the remark that he was intensely devoted to Greek, Porson's reply was, \\"If Mr. Cogan is passionately fond of Greek, he must be content to dine on bread and cheese for the remainder of his life.\\" William Parr praised Cogan's \\"intellectual powers, his literary attainments, and candour\\", and in 1821 stated that he had given directions that on his death a ring should be presented to Cogan. Joseph Priestley was his guide in theology and metaphysics. His works were numerous. Besides the Fragment on Philosophical Necessity, Cogan wrote: *An Address to the Dissenters on Classical Literature, 1789, in which he urged the study of the classics. *Moschi Idyllia tria, Gr√¶ce, 1795, which he edited with notes for the use of his scholars, but afterwards suppressed. *Reflections on the Evidences of Christianity, 1796. *Purity and Perfection of Christian Morality, 1800. *Christianity and Atheism compared, 1800. To this an answer was issued by a Mr. Robinson, whereupon Cogan published An Examination of Mr. Robinson's reply to Mr. Cogan on the Practical Influence of a belief in a Future State, 1800. *Sermons Chiefly on Practical Subjects, 1817, 2 vols. *Contributions to the Monthly Magazine, Dr. Aikin's Athen√¶um, the Monthly Repository, and the Christian Reformer, by the late Rev. Eliezer Cogan, 2 parts, I. Classical; II. Theological, Metaphysical, and Biblical. Extracted and compiled by his son, Richard Cogan, 1856. He was the author of several sermons on the deaths of members of his congregation at Cheshunt and Walthamstow, and he read in manuscript and suggested some alterations in Alexander Crombie's Natural Theology (1829). A long memoir of Cogan appeared in the Christian Reformer, xi. 237‚Äì59 (1855), and was printed at Hackney as a pamphlet the same year. His third daughter Eliza, wife of Thomas Field Gibson, printed for private circulation 25 copies of a short work entitled Recollections of my Youth, Written at the Request of my Daughter, giving details of school-life under Cogan.

She saw service in the Danish navy and participated in two notable actions against the British Royal Navy during the Gunboat War. In 1814, as a result of the Treaty of Kiel, the Danes transferred her to the Norwegian navy. The Norwegians sold her to German merchants in the Scheld in 1825. She was finally shipwrecked near Bremerhaven in 1881. Danish Navy = Lougen vs. Childers= On 14 March 1808 Lougen found the British brig engaged in escort duty in Norwegian waters. Lougen tried over the course of several hours to bring about an engagement, and eventually succeeded, but Childers escaped much damaged though her crew did suffer casualties. =Lougen vs. Seagull= On Sunday, 19 June 1808, off the Naze of Norway in the vicinity of the port of Kristiansand, encountered and chased Lougen. Lougen, under the command of First Lieutenant Peter Frederik Wulff,Dansk Milit√¶rhistorie tried to maintain a distance from Seagull to take advantage of the range of her 18-pounders relative to the range of Seagulls 24-pounder carronades. The chase brought both vessels close in shore where the fresh breeze was lessening to a near calm. Seagull tried to get between Lougen and the shore to prevent her from reaching Kristiansand. Unfortunately for Seagull, about 20 minutes into the engagement six Danish gunboats arrived from behind some rocks, and in two divisions of three each, took up positions on Seagulls quarter, where they fired on her with their 24-pounder guns while Lougen fired on her larboard bow. Within half an hour the Danish fire had badly damaged Seagulls rigging and dismounted five of her guns. Eventually Seagulls captain, Commander Robert B. Cathcart, who was himself severely wounded, struck, having lost eight men killed and 20 wounded. Lougen had only one man killed and a dozen men slightly wounded. Shortly after Seagull had surrendered, and after her crew and wounded had been taken off, she sank. A number of the prize crew from the Lougen drowned as Seagull sank. The Danes later recovered Seagull and took her into their naval service. =In Northern Waters= Jochum Nicolay M√ºller, a native of Trondheim, took command of Lougen in 1809. During the summer of 1809, three British vessels ‚Äì (18; Commander Thomas Young), (16), and (14) ‚Äì operated in the far northern waters of Norway, briefly occupying, after one failed attempt, the small town and sheltered harbour of Hammerfest near North Cape. In the spring of 1810 the two Danish-Norwegian brigs Lougen and (under the newly promoted Captain M√ºller and Senior Lieutenant Thomas L√ºtken, respectively) left Fredericksv√¶rn and reached Hammerfest on 28 June. Three gun-schooners - Nornen, Valkyren, and Axel Thorsen - each with two 24-pounder guns, one fore and one aft ‚Äì had joined them en route. This squadron sailed to find the British squadron in the waters of North Cape, for which, however, there were few and poor charts, and no pilotage instructions. The two remaining British ships, Nightingale and Gallant, had been warned of the Danes' approach and had left, apparently having sailed to Greenland to escort a convoy of British whalers. In the absence of the enemy, coastal trade blossomed with Russia and the Danish vessels escorted a final convoy of the year into Trondheim,Aftenpost, 29 May 1922, as repeated on website . Translated from the Danish including 11 prize merchant ships.Tops√∏e-Jensen Vol II pp. 227-229In 1811 protection of the north fell to the smaller ships; first the Dane-Norwegian navy and then the Norwegian navy maintained a naval presence in the area until 1816, but the primary mission became one of improving charts and pilot instructions for these waters. On 31 July 1811, Lougen, in company with the brigs and Kiel, encountered and cruising together in Long Sound, Norway. The Danes had 54 guns and 480 men, against the British 22 guns and 107 men.The Naval Chronicle gives the Danish strength as 60 guns (all long 18-pounders), and 550 men. Outnumbered and outgunned, the British vessels took flight.Naval Chronicle Vol. 26 (Jul-Dec 1811), pp. 284-286. The next day Brev Drageren unsuccessfully re-engaged first one and then two of the brigs. In the inconclusive engagement each British vessel sustained one man killed, and Brev Drageren also had three wounded. In the second day's fight, Algerine sent a boat and sweeps to Brev Drageren, which helped her escape the Danes, though not until after her crew had rowed for 30 hours.James (1837), Vol. 5, p. 346. Lolland captured two mercantile galleases that Brev Drageren had been escorting. Fate After the Treaty of Kiel and Norway's separation from Denmark, Lougen was transferred to the Norwegian navy in 1814. In 1825 the Norwegians sold her into the merchant navy and she moved to the Scheldt. She was shipwrecked in 1881 at Bremerhaven.

Washington Steel was founded in 1945\\"50 Years of Innovation: The Story of Washington Steel Corporation\\" (1995) Washington, PA: Washington Steel Corporation by T. S. Fitch who was a member of the U.S. War Production Board from 1942 to 1944. As a member of the Board's Steel Division, he saw a Sendzimir Cold Rolling Mill in operation, and began to appreciate its potential value for rolling stainless steel into thin, high-accuracy sheets.Fitch, T. S. (1967). Washington Steel was Born South of Columbus (Newcomen Society of North America, New York). Washington Steel began production in 1947, with a 39-inch Z-mill much wider than any previously produced (it cost $278,000, installed). The light-gauge stainless steel had exceptional dimensional accuracy and surface quality, and in its first year of operation the company posted net income of $237,000. Sales in 1948 were $4.6 million, and by 1954, more than quadrupled to $19 million. The company's ability to achieve dimensional precision in strong, light-gauge steel quickly won favor in the aerospace industry, and was used in the Atlas missile which served as the launch vehicle for NASA's Project Mercury, which sent the first American into earth orbit in 1962 (John Glenn). The company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol WSS on Feb 7, 1968, and remained there until its purchase by Blount, Inc. in 1979. Washington Steel was purchased by Lukens Steel Company in April 1992 for $274 million. In 1999, Bethlehem Steel, the owner of Lukens Steel at the time, declared bankruptcy and sold off the Houston and Massillon mills to Allegheny Teledyne.

Located north of Marietta, in the Muskingum Township community of Devola,DeLorme. Ohio Atlas & Gazetteer. 7th ed. Yarmouth: DeLorme, 2004, 81. . it has changed little since its construction in the early nineteenth century, and it has been designated a historic site. Barker's life Born in Newmarket, New Hampshire in 1765, Joseph Barker moved his family to Ohio in 1789. After practicing carpentry in Marietta and serving in the militia during the Northwest Indian War, in 1795 he settled along the Muskingum River, about above Marietta. The family soon returned to that village, as their property and all of their stores were destroyed by fire in the following winter.Andrews, Martin R., ed. History of Marietta and Washington County, Ohio and Representative Citizens. Chicago: Biographical, 1902. Undaunted, they returned northward, becoming one of the first families to settle in Wiseman's Bottom along the river. Within a few years of settling in Ohio, Barker became a prominent member of local society: he was promoted to colonel of the militia during the war, was named a justice of the peace in 1799, and was elected to serve as the judge of Washington County's common pleas court from 1830 to 1842. Key to Barker's prominence in the community was his important skilled trade: besides being a carpenter, he was a capable architect and shipbuilder. Among the many ships that he built at his farm were some that were ultimately used for the Burr expedition. Joseph Barker's daughter, Frances Dana Barker Gage, was a writer, and a leading American reformer, feminist and abolitionist. Barker's manuscript, Recollections,Barker, Joseph: Recollections of the First Settlement of Ohio, Marietta College, Marietta, Ohio (1958); original manuscript written late in Joseph Barker's life, prior to his death in 1843. provides details of pioneer history regarding the first permanent American settlement of the new United States in the Northwest Territory. Architecture Barker's house is a rectangular two-story structure completed in 1811. Measuring three bays wide, the facade features a central entrance with a large fanlight and sidelights flanking the doorway. All three windows on the facade's second story are placed within brick arches that are recessed into the wall of the house.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 1389. Built of brick, the house rests on a foundation of sandstone and is covered with a slate roof., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2011-01-21. As one of Ohio's first master builders, Barker was responsible for constructing many prominent buildings in Marietta and vicinity; as the first such structure to be completed, the Barker House occupies a significant place in the architecture of the Marietta region. Contributing to its importance is its rarity and its unusually good state of preservation: few changes have been made to the house in the two centuries since its construction, and almost none of the other buildings designed by Barker have survived to the present day. Recognition In 1978, the Colonel Joseph Barker House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Qualifying it for this distinction were its historically significant architecture and its association with Barker himself. It is one of thirty-five Washington County places to be listed on the Register; among the other thirty- four is the home of the colonel's son, Joseph, Jr., which lies along State Route 7 above Marietta.

Life Cole was a native of London, born in 1628. His father William Cole owned property, and sent him to Westminster School, from where, in 1646, he was elected student of Christ Church, Oxford. He proceeded B.A. in 1649, and M.A. 8 July 1651, and in 1656 became principal of St. Mary Hall. As a tutor he had pupils including John Locke. The Restoration of Charles II led to the ejection of Cole from his position at Oxford. He then opened a dissenting academy at Nettlebed, Oxfordshire, where one of those under his charge was James Bonnell. Samuel Wesley attacked the character of Cole, based on reports from Bonnell; Samuel Palmer defended Cole in his Vindication of the Dissenters. In February 1674 Cole succeeded Philip Nye as minister of the Independent congregation at Silver Street meeting-house, London. He was also one of the ministers of the merchants' lecture at Pinners' Hall. His church, after leaving Silver Street, met at Tallow Chandlers' Hall, Dowgate Hill, and then at Pinners' Hall, where he preached his last sermon 22 August 1697. Cole was buried in the upper ground of Bunhill Fields, but the precise spot is not known. Works As well as three sermons in the Morning Exercises, 1674, and one in the Casuistical Morning Exercise, 1690, his writings are: * The old Apostolical Way of Preaching: a funeral sermon for Rev.

After the U.S. revival in 1904 of the abandoned French-led canal construction project, skilled workers and management staff were recruited almost exclusively from the United States. By contract, these U.S. employees were paid in gold-backed U.S. dollars. Unskilled labor was variously sourced, but the great majority of laborers were West Indians; their wages were paid in local silver-backed currency. Wages were disbursed from separate payroll windows to employees in the two categories, and their social lives (in respect of housing, recreation, transportation, and health services, for example) were also organized around this distinction. Even post offices featured segregated gold-roll and silver- roll sections.McCullough, David.

Panama Fever: The Epic Story of the Building of the Panama Canal (New York 2007), pp. 381-384 The system evolved out of less rigid racial practices under the American-owned Panama Railroad and the earlier French-led canal effort. But the system was gradually tightened up specifically to enforce racial segregationist policies. This process took place between 1905 and 1908 under Chief Engineer John Stevens and his successor, George Washington Goethals, and even played a role in the U.S. presidential election of 1908. Skilled workers from the West Indies were demoted to the silver roll. The gold roll was explicitly limited to U.S. and Panamanian citizens by order of U.S. Secretary of War William Howard Taft during his 1908 presidential campaign, in response to demands by American labor unions. A small number of black American citizens were also employed on the gold roll but were denied gold roll privileges. In response to their protests, the canal authorities stopped hiring black U.S. citizens. Hardly any black American citizens remained on the canal workforce after 1909.Parker, ibid., pp. 435-437 Notes References *McCullough, David.

The community is located along the Wilson Branch of the Harpeth River. The intersection of former local roads State Route 96 (Murfreesboro Road) and the concurrency of U.S. Routes 31A and 41A (Nolensville Road) is here. The community is located just north of these roads interchange with Interstate 840. History The earliest recorded non-Native American settlement in the Triune area was by William Jordan, a Virginian who built a log cabin there in 1796. By the early 1800s, a community had developed, called Hardeman's Crossroads after an early landowner. Settlers continued to arrive from Virginia and Kentucky, sometimes bringing slaves with them. By the 1820s the community consisted of a number of substantial buildings, including a general store, saloons, and a leather shop. Local cotton plantations even had their own mills and cotton gins. The planters had brought in numerous enslaved African Americans. The Hardeman Academy was opened in 1828 as a private boys school, and the Hardeman's Crossroads post office had opened by 1830. The community's name was then changed to Flemingsburg. The Triune Methodist Church, built in 1849 as the first church structure in the community, and in time the community adopted Triune as its permanent name.Robert S. Brandt (1995), Touring the Middle Tennessee Backroads, p. 180. John F. Blair, Publisher. , . Five schools for white children were built between 1820 and 1845. During the Civil War, Triune was the site of several military engagements. A number of Confederate brigades under General Braxton Bragg defended Middle Tennessee, and in December 1862 the area saw military activity related to the Battle of Stones River at Murfreesboro. Essentially a drawn battle, the Confederates nevertheless retreated and the Union Army occupied Triune, erecting fortifications to control the crossroads.THE WAR IN TENNESSEE.; The Positions of the Opposing Forces. General Rosecrans Massing His Forces at Murfreesboro. CONSTANT SKIRMISHING AT THE OUTPOSTS. New York Times, March 29, 1863 Between April and June 1863, several cavalry skirmishes were fought in Triune, including one in June in which Confederate forces led under Nathan Bedford Forrest broke through the Union lines.THE WAR IN TENNESSEE.; ANOTHER FIGHT AT TRIUNE THE REBELS REPULSED. National Soldiers to be Executed for Desertion., New York Times, June 14, 1863. The Methodist and Baptist churches, several homes, and the Porter Female Academy were burned by Union troops in 1863.Bostick Female Academy historical marker, Edge of the Wildwood website, August 23, 2010 The community slowly rebuilt after the war, though by the 1880s Triune still had only 57 white residents. On May 2, 1892, African Americans in the area reportedly killed at least three white residents in retaliation for the lynching of Ephraim Grizzard in Nashville. Grizzard had been taken from jail and a mob estimated at over 10,000 gathered to see him hanged from a city bridge. Nashville is 30 miles north of Triune and those killed by the African Americans had no known connection to the Nashville lynching. Bostick Female Academy in November 2013 Dr. Jonathan Bostick, a Mississippi planter, had been a trustee of Porter Female Academy and knew it was destroyed in the war. Before his death in 1868, he made a bequest in his will to establish a \\"suitable site and buildings\\" for a new \\"female academy\\" in Tennessee.U.S. Supreme Court, Peters v. Bowman, 98 U.S. 56, 25 L.Ed. 91. October term 1878. Because his descendants contested the will, there was a long delay in implementing the bequest. Litigation reached the U.S. Supreme Court, which upheld his bequest. Some of land in Triune were purchased for the development of what was called the Bostick Female Academy. It was built in 1892 and began operation in 1893. The Bostick Female Academy operated until about 1900 as a girls' boarding and day school for whites, enrolling as many as 75 girls. After the state started to fund public education, parents no longer supported private schooling. The Hardeman Academy, built in 1828 as a boys' school, was converted to a public school. After it was destroyed by fire in 1904, the Bostick Female Academy building was used as the community public school. It served this role until the mid-20th century; since then it has been purchased and used as a private residence.Brandt (1995) says the building was used as a public school until 1957, but the historical marker on the property gives a date of 1949.

Becoming a master at Christ's Hospital, Hertford, he was engaged from 1840 to 1847 with the Rev. R. H. Webb in preparing the Flora Hertfordiensis (London, 1849). In 1847 he became assistant-master in the grammar school, Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire. Coleman died at Burton-on-Trent. Works In 1834, Coleman was author, in conjunction with John William Colenso, of Examples in Arithmetic and Algebra (Cambridge). The Flora Hertfordiensis contains an \\"Introduction on the Physical Geography and Botanical Divisions of the County\\", by Coleman, written in 1846, which is the first case in which a county flora was distributed into river-basin districts; and appendices (1) on this system, embodying the substance of a paper \\"On the Geographical Distribution of British Plants\\" in The Phytologist (1848, iii. 217); and (2) on ≈ínanthe fluviatilis, which he was the first to diagnose (English Botany Supplement, 2944, and Ann.

GSM network consist of different cells and each cell transmit signals to and receive signals from the mobile station, for proper working of base station many parameters are defined before functioning the base station such as the coverage area of a cell depends on different factors including the transmitting power of the base station, obstructing buildings in cells, height of the base station and location of base station. Radio Frequency Optimization is a process through which different soft (Cell Reselect Offset, BTS power) and hard (e.g. Electrical Tilt, Mechanical Tilt, Azimuth etc.) parameters of the Base transceiver stations are changed in order to improve the coverage area and improve quality of signal. Besides that there are various key performance indicators which have to be constantly monitored and necessary changes proposed in order to keep KPIs in agreed limits with the mobile operator.  Introduction  Optimization is an important step in the life cycle of a wireless network. Drive testing is the first step in the process, with the goal of collecting measurement data as a function of location. Once the data has been collected over the desired RF coverage area, it is output to post-processing software. Engineers can use the collection and post-processing software to identify the causes of RF coverage or interference problems and determine how these problems can be solved. When the problems, causes and solutions have been identified, steps are performed to solve the problems. Network statistics are also an important step in analysis and troubleshooting of RF issues. Every node (BTS, BSC, MSC) has its own counters some of which are incremented/decremented on occurrence of different events e.g. a dropped call due to low signal strength. These statistics are analysed using different graphs and reports and when KPI from the statistics exceed the limit, extensive analysis is carried out to identify and troubleshoot the problem.  Technical details  = GSM call flow = There are various control channels involved in setting up of a voice call in a GSM network. On Broadcast Channels system information and various parameters along with synchronization and frequency correction information is transmitted. Common Control Channels are used for informing the mobile or the GSM network about a service (voice, data, SMS) initiation and Dedicated Control Channels are used for call setup, authentication, location updating and SMS. A mobile is informed on a paging channel (PCH) that it has a call or SMS, to which the mobile station responds with a Random Access Channel (RACH) request. The mobile station is notified on an Access Grant Channel (AGCH) that it may tune to a specific Stand-alone dedicated control channel (SDCCH) which is called Immediate Assignment. The user is authenticated and ciphering commands are received on this channel. After successful authentication the mobile station is requested to tune to an assigned traffic channel (TCH). This process is called TCH assignment. Then the user starts to move from one cell to another and the process of smooth transitioning of call from one cell to the other is called a handover. While on the SDCCH or TCH a call may get dropped which is accounted to SDCCH drop or TCH drop respectively. = Key Performance Indicators(KPI) =  Paging success rate  Paging Success by far is the most complex KPI to deal with as the process of paging touches almost all the nodes in GSM system and is influenced by performance of each of them. That‚Äôs the reason why this write up on paging looks too interwoven and cross refers to too many things. But the plus point with paging is by the time paging success rate in a network gets improved; almost all the other KPIs too stand improved. In response to an incoming call, the MSC initiates the paging process by broadcasting a \\"paging request\\" message on the paging sub channel (IMSI or TMSI of the MS and its Paging Group) and starts timer T3113. A \\"paging message\\" consists of the mobile identity (IMSI or TMSI) of the MS being paged and its \\"paging group number\\". A Paging Request Message may include more than one MS identification. The maximum number of paged MS per message is 4 when using \\"TMSI\\" for identification of the MS (maximum number of paged MS per message is 2 when using IMSI). The BSC receives this page and processes the paging request and schedules it for transmission on the PCH at appropriate time. The MS on its part will analyse the paging messages (and immediate assignment messages) sent on the paging sub channel corresponding to its paging group. Upon receipt of a \\"paging request\\" message, MS will initiate within 0.7s an immediate assignment procedure. Upon receipt of a page at the MS, the MS responds by transmitting a channel request on the RACH. BSS in response to the received \\"channel request\\", will process it and immediately assign the MS a SDCCH (immediate assignment / assignment reject; done over AGCH). MS Paging response- After receiving the immediate assignment command, MS switches to the assigned \\"SDCCH\\" and transmits a \\"Paging Response\\". The establishment of the main signalling link is then initiated with information field containing the \\"PAGING RESPONSE\\" message and the \\"paging response\\" is sent to the MSC. Upon receipt of the \\"Paging Response\\" MSC stops the timer T3113. If the timer T3113 expires and a \\"Paging Response\\"message has not been received, the MSC may repeat the \\"Paging Request\\" message and start T3113 all over again. The number of successive paging attempt is a network dependent choice. One control channel Multi Frame is made of 51 TDMA frames with a time duration of 235 ms. Each 51 TDMA frame Multi Frame will have 9 Common Control Channel (CCCH) blocks. Each of these 9 CCCH block is made of 4 TDMA frames. Each CCCH block can carry Paging Messages for 2 MS if IMSI based paging is used or 4 MS if TMSI based paging is used. Thus the paging capacity for one 51 TDMA frame Multi Frame will be 9(number of CCCH blocks available per Multi Frame) * 4 (when TMSI based paging is used) = 36 mobiles per 235 ms or 9*2 = 18 mobiles per 235 ms when IMSI based paging is used. Thus the paging capacity of a cell is 153 mobiles per second when TMSI based paging are used and 68 mobiles per second when IMSI based paging are used. This means we can improve the \\"paging bandwidth\\" for a cell (if there are too many \\"paging discards at the cell level\\") by using TMSI based paging rather than IMSI based (at the expense of increased processor load at the BSC and MSC). When the rate of \\"paging load\\" at the BTS becomes higher than what the BTS is able to handle (paging capacity of BTS), BTS will start discarding pages (check for high \\"page discard\\" stats at the cell level). Once an MS deciphers its paging group, in an idle mode, it will tune in and check for an incoming page only during broadcast time for its paging group (so further the paging groups are places across multiple 51 frame multi frames, less frequently it will tune in to check for an incoming page and longer will be its battery life.  Immediate assignment success rate  Immediate assignment success rate indicates the success rate of the MS accessing the signaling channel. It concerns the procedure from the MS sending a channel required message to the BTS to the MS sending an establish indication message to the network. Immediate assignment success rate is a key access counter. It directly reflects the success rate of the MS accessing the signaling channel and affects the user experience. The immediate assignment success rate is calculated from traffic statistics. The recommended formula is as follows: Immediate Assignment Success Rate = (Successful Immediate Assignments/Immediate Assignment Requests) x 100% Symptom Description : If the immediate assignment success rate decreases, the following symptoms may occur: Call setup success rate decreases. Congestion occurs frequently on the SDCCH Traffic volume on the TCH decreases Short messages cannot be successfully sent.  Random access success rate  Random Access Channel (RACH) is used by the MS on the \\"uplink\\" to request for allocation of an SDCCH. This request from the MS on the uplink could either be as a page response (MS being paged by the BSS in response to an incoming call) or due to user trying to access the network to establish a call. Availability of SDCCH at the BTS will not have any impact on the Random Access Success. In the transceiver, the timeslot handler in charge of the RACH channel listens for access burst from mobiles (on the time-slot that transmits BCCH). These bursts contain a check sequence (8 bits) that is used to determine if the message is valid.  SDCCH drop rate  SDCCH Call Drop Rate indicates the probability of call drops that occur when MSs occupy SDCCHs.SDCCH Call Drop Rate is one of accessibility KPIs. This KPI reflects the seizure condition of signaling channels. If the value of this KPI is high, user experience is adversely affected. SDCCH Call Drop Rate = Call Drops on SDCCH/ Successful SDCCH  TCH assignment success rate  TCH assignment failure is a phenomenon where the MS is not able to use the TCH which is assigned to it for voice call. This could happen due to uplink /downlink interference, faulty radio or faulty antenna system.  Call drop rate  TCH drop (or a dropped call) could be broadly classified into 3 sub classes: * Degradation of the links (Uplink and Downlink): either degradation of Signal Strength which falls near or lower than the sensitivity of the base station (around to -110 dBm) or that of the mobile (around -104dBm) or degradation of quality of the links (Uplink and Downlink) often due to interference. * Excess TA (TA>63 or excess path imbalance due to high TA). * Other Reasons.  Handover success rate  Handover in BSS system is controlled an algorithm in the BSC. This algorithm operates on the basis of Measurement Reports (MR) sent in by the MS on SACCH. The inputs that the BSC uses for making a handover decision, from the received MRs from the MS is the DL signal strength, DL quality, and the signal strength of the six best reported neighbours. From the serving BTS, for the same MS the BSC will use UL signal strength, UL quality and TA.  Optimization process  Optimization process can be explained by below step by step description: =Problem analysis= * Analyzing performance retrieve tool reports and statistics for the worst performing BSCs and/or Sites * Viewing Reports for BSC/Site performance trends * Examining Planning tool Coverage predictions * Analyzing previous drive test data * Discussions with local engineers to prioritize problems * Checking Customer Complaints reported to local engineers =Checks prior to action= * Cluster definitions by investigating BSC borders, main cities, freeways, major roads * Investigating customer distribution, customer habits (voice/data usage) * Running specific traces on Network to categorize problems * Checking trouble ticket history for previous problems * Checking any fault reports to limit possible hardware problems prior to test =Drive testing= * Preparing Action Plan Defining drive test routes * Collecting RSSI Log files * Scanning frequency spectrum for possible interference sources * Re‚Äìdriving questionable data =Subjects to investigate= * Non-working sites/sectors or TRXs * In-active Radio network features like frequency hopping * Disabled GPRS * Overshooting sites ‚Äì coverage overlaps * Coverage holes * C/I, C/A analysis * High Interference Spots * Drop Calls * Capacity Problems * Other Interference Sources * Missing Neighbors * One‚Äìway neighbors * Ping‚ÄìPong Handovers * Not happening handovers * Accessibility and Retain-ability of the Network * Equipment Performance * Faulty Installations =After the test= * Post processing of data Plotting RX Level and Quality Information for overall picture of the driven area * Initial Discussions on drive test with Local engineers * Reporting urgent problems for immediate action * Analyzing Network feature performance after new implementations * Transferring comments on parameter implementations after new changes =Recommendations= * Defining missing neighbor relations * Proposing new sites or sector additions with Before & After coverage plots * Proposing antenna azimuth changes * Proposing antenna tilt changes * Proposing antenna type changes * BTS Equipment/Filter change * Re‚Äìtuning of interfered frequencies * BSIC changes * AdjustingHandover margins (Power Budget, Level, Quality, Umbrella HOs) * Adjusting accessibility parameters (RX Lev Acc Min, etc..) * Changing power parameters * Attenuation Adds/Removals * MHA/TMA adds External links *GSM RF Optimization Category:GSM standard ","title":"GSM Radio Frequency optimization"},{"id":"30580654","text":"Professor Peter Leslie Lee (born 1954) is an Australian engineer, academic, and higher education administrator, and a recognized authority within the field of process control.

It lies east of Quincy Bay and is met at the southwest by the mouth of Weymouth Fore River, also forming part of the waterfront of Weymouth. The bay is home to several of the Boston Harbor Islands. Description The bay is roughly wide east to west and long south to north. It is nearly enclosed on all sides, surrounded by peninsulas, former islands joined to the mainland, and Peddocks Island. There are two passages to Nantasket Roads and the Atlantic Ocean, one a opening at Hull Gut between Peddocks Island and Windmill Point in the northwest and a passage at West Gut between the island and Hough's Neck at Nut Island, part of the city of Quincy. Along the western portion of Hingham Bay a wide, deep channel allows oceangoing ships access from Hull Gut to Weymouth Fore River. To the north and east the bay is bordered by the town of Hull, where the contiguous water reaching the Hull shore is also known as Hull Bay. On the south, moving west, Hingham Bay is fed by three estuaries: Weir River between Hull and Hingham, Weymouth Back River between Hingham and Weymouth, and Weymouth Fore River between Weymouth and Quincy. Bumpkin Island () in Hingham and Grape Island () in Weymouth, along with the smaller Slate Island and Sheep Island, are part of the Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area. Spinnaker Island in the north is attached to Hull by a low bridge. Other islands under in size that are associated with the bay include Button, Langlee, Ragged and Sarah Islands, all in Hingham Harbor. The southeast part of the bay is separated from Weir River estuary by World's End, a peninsular park owned by The Trustees of Reservations. History Boston Harbor and its smaller sections such as Hingham Bay are characterized by geography created through Quaternary glaciations. During the last 100,000 years two glacial periods shaped the typical topography of the area through creation of drumlins and moraines followed by marine incursion flooding the low levels as the glaciers receded. This geological activity accounts for the variety of necks, peninsulas and islands in the harbor. The native Massachusett and antecedent tribes populated the islands of Hingham Bay as early as 8,000 years before the present, taking advantage of a rich marine ecology which featured shellfish, fishing and wild flora. The natives were first encountered in 1621 during the colonization of the Atlantic seaboard by settlers from England in the 17th century. Native Americans were removed from the islands and Hingham Bay area as a result of King Philip's War in 1675, while fishing continued to be a main activity of the colonists. Military posts were established on Peddocks Island and Fort Revere at the strategically important Hull Gut entrance to Hingham Bay beginning in the American Revolution. Ships and submarines were produced at Fore River Shipyard located on Weymouth Fore River near where the river enters Hingham Bay beginning in the early 20th century. During World War II, hundreds of ships produced for the United States Navy at Fore River Shipyard and the associated Bethlehem- Hingham Shipyard in Hingham first entered the Atlantic at Hingham Bay. Following the war, the list of possible locations for United Nations Headquarters included the unused land at World's End on Hingham Bay. The land was also later considered as a location for a nuclear power plant that was eventually built in Plymouth. The protection of Hingham Bay has been assisted by the establishment of the Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area in 1996 and the establishment of the Weir River Estuary Park Committee by the towns of Cohasset, Hingham and Hull in 2002.

Life He was a native of Buckinghamshire. Beginning in 1803, he spent four years at Westminster School and then in 1807 he entered Christ Church, Oxford. He obtained a B.A. in classics in 1811 and a M.A. in 1813. He would later dedicate his work on Bible editions to the memory of Cyril Jackson, dean of Christ Church. He was sub-librarian of the Bodleian Library from 1814 to 1822. In 1820 he received a D.C.L. from Oxford. His father-in-law Richard Laurence was appointed Archbishop of Cashel, Ireland in 1822, so in 1823 Henry Cotton moved there to serve as his domestic chaplain. The following year Henry became archdeacon of Cashel. In 1832 he became treasurer of Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin; in 1834 he became dean of Lismore Cathedral. His eyesight began failing, causing him to retire from active duties of the ministry, and he gave up the deanery of Lismore in 1849. In 1872 he became almost totally blind. He died at his residence in Lismore 3 December 1879, and was buried in the graveyard of Lismore Cathedral. Works He wrote extensively, and among his works is the six-volume Fasti Ecclesi√¶ Hibernic√¶, a compilation of brief biographical sketches giving \\"the succession of the prelates and members of the cathedral bodies in Ireland\\". He also compiled A List of Editions of the Bible in English from 1505 to 1820, with Specimens of Translations, &c.; (Oxford, 1821, second edition, corrected and enlarged, 1852).

The building was designed in Egyptian Revival style by prolific Meridian architect P.J. Krouse, who also designed Meridian City Hall in 1915 and the 1906 Greek Revival building used by Congregation Beth Israel. History The site of the former building was originally the site of the Methodist Mississippi Female College (MFC), established in 1869 as the city's second oldest college (only surpassed by the Baptist MFC, established in 1865). The Methodist MFC was later converted into Beeson's College. The design of the Scottish Rite building was inspired by a trip to Egypt taken by Hyman W. Witcover, an architect from Savannah, Georgia. The architect was impressed by the Temple to Osiris on the island of Philae, now submerged due to the construction of the Aswan Dam. Witcover designed a Scottish Rite Cathedral with the hope that it would one day be built by the Scottish Rite. Krouse revised and resubmitted the plans in 1914 and supervised construction, which was carried out by the Cass Construction Company, located in Georgia. The three story building was built into the side of a hill so that the northern facade appeared only two stories tall with a basement. Circling the whole building was an Egyptian-style gorge- and-roll cornice. A central projecting section on the northern side of the building contained a recessed entrance supported by columns with lotus flower capitals. A vulture and sundisk symbol was located in the entablature directly above the columns, and the front entrance was flanked by sphinxes covered in polychromatic terracotta and two obelisks.

It was of unusual design, being a biplane with twin fuselages housing the crew of two and a central nacelle which carried the aircraft's twin engines in a push-pull configuration. Design and development The MB-4 was designed to meet a June 1919 specification from the United States Post Office Department for a two- or three-engined mailplane, required to carry 1,500 lb (682 kg) of mail on a single engine. Thomas-Morse chose to use as much as possible of its existing Thomas-Morse MB-3 fighter in order to reduce costs, using two engineless MB-3 fuselages to carry the crew and cargo, with the pilot in a cockpit in the nose of the port fuselage and the co-pilot/mechanic in a similar cockpit in the nose of the starboard fuselage, while cargo was carried behind the crew in each fuselage. Two 300 hp (224 kW) Wright-Hisso H V8 engines were mounted in a central nacelle between the two main fuselages in a push-pull configuration, with fuel tanks mounted between the engines.Eberspacher 2001. The MB-4's three-bay biplane wings were all new, with ailerons on the upper wing. It had a conventional tailwheel undercarriage and had two separate tail assemblies, which were standard MB-3 empennages. Dual controls were fitted, with the pilot able to disconnect the co-pilot's controls, but there were no means of communication between the two cockpits. Operational history The MB-4 made its maiden flight in February 1920. While the aircraft had reasonable speed for the time, it was otherwise poor, with one fuselage tending to take-off before the other, while the engines caused severe vibration which overloaded the aircraft's structure.\\"Thomas, Thomas-Morse\\". aerofiles. 1 August 2008. Retrieved 22 January 2011. It was described as the \\"worst thing on wings\\" by Jerome Fried, the general plant superintendent of Thomas-Morse. One aircraft was tested by the US Post Office, but was not used for mail services, and was scrapped in 1921. At least one MB.4 (and possibly 3) was delivered to the United States Army Air Service where it was stored before being scrapped. The MB-4 was a failure, having extremely poor flying characteristics and being described as the \\"worst thing on wings\\", and saw no service other than the trials by the manufacturer, US Army and the US Post Office.

The group consisted of Jay Robinson, the lead male vocalist and songwriter, and a female lead, Nannie \\"Penny\\" Coulter, with several male backup singers and an accompanying guitarist. The songs were recorded some time between 1970 and 1975 at either Harmonic Sounds Studio or at the home of studio co-owner Clem Price in Columbus. Relegated to storage, the songs were discovered after Price's death in 2006 when a collection of tapes and acetate records were purchased at his estate sale.

Life Colepeper was the only son of Sir Thomas Colepeper, knt., lieutenant of Dover Castle, and of St. Stephen's, otherwise Hackington, Kent, by his wife, Lady Barbara, daughter of Robert Sidney, 1st Earl of Leicester, and widow of Thomas Smythe, 1st Viscount Strangford. Born, according to his own statement, on the Christmas Day of 1637, he lost both his parents six years later. Colepeper lived as steward with the Strangford family. With his half-brother, Philip, viscount Strangford, he busied himself in promoting the king's return, and was imprisoned by the council of state in August and September 1659. In 1662 he married Frances, third and youngest daughter of John, lord Frecheville, of Staveley, Derbyshire, by his second wife, Sarah, daughter and heiress of Sir John Harrington, knt. It was a stolen match, and so displeasing to Lord Frecheville, that, while outwardly reconciled, he refused to make his daughter any settlement. At his death, in March 1682, he left her an annuity of 300 l., which owing to the reduced state of his fortune was probably never paid. Lord Frecheville had in fact been obliged to sell his manor of Staveley and other lands to the Earl of Devonshire in the October previous to his death. This sale was afterwards made the subject of much litigation by Colepeper. He used every means in his power to set aside the sale, and, exasperated by repeated failure, he took occasion to publicly insult his opponent by striking him within the precincts of the court at Whitehall Palace, on 9 July 1685; the assault was witnessed by John Evelyn. For this offence Colepeper was imprisoned in the Marshalsea Prison, and subsequently condemned to lose his hand. His wife's letters to him during his imprisonment are in Harl. MS. 7005. At her entreaty Lord Danby used his influence with the king, and Colepeper was pardoned. After Monmouth's rebellion Colepeper was encouraged to show himself at court, where he would in all probability have obtained some minor office. But on the evening of 26 April 1687 the Earl of Devonshire, encountering him in the Vane Chamber at Whitehall, while the king and queen were in the presence, challenged him to walk out, and on Colepeper's refusal struck him with his cane. It was now the earl's turn to be imprisoned and tried. In the result he was fined ¬£30,000, and in default of payment was committed to the King's Bench Prison, from which, however, he soon managed to escape. In the next reign the fine was remitted. The sequel was recorded by Narcissus Luttrell, who under the date of 1 July 1697 wrote: \\"Yesterday the Duke of Devon meeting Coll. Colpepper at the auction house in St. Albans Street, caned him for being troublesome to him in the late reign.\\" Colepeper had now lost all hope of preferment at court, and, having sold his family estate in 1675, was left without provision in his old age. His wife had died on 3 December 1698, leaving no issue. The rest of his life is a record of schemes, pretended discoveries of mines, and of projects for the improvement of the army, navy, and revenue. He died at his lodging in Tothill Street, Westminster, in December 1708, and was buried on the 28th in the neighbouring church of St. Margaret. He had been elected to the Royal Society on 28 May 1668, and was the friend of Thomas Bushell the engineer. Works Many of Colepeper's manuscripts are in the British Library. The more important are his transcript of the 'Frecheville Evidences,' from a copy 'made by some herald,' probably Richard St. George (Harl. MS. 7435), and the eighteen volumes of what he called 'Adversaria' (Harl. MSS. 7587‚Äì7605). Other manuscripts are: *Collections from Public Records (Harl. MS. 6833) *Commonplace Books (Harl. MS. 0817‚Äì18) *Memorandum Book (Addit. MS. 11205). At the end of Harl. MS. 7560, ff. 293‚Äì7, are some sheets of a petition to the court of chancery, a document detailing a secret marriage between the colonel and the widow of Sir Thomas Grosvenor.

Event-B is a notation and method developed from the B-Method and is intended to be used with an incremental style of modelling. The idea of incremental modelling has been taken from programming: modern programming languages come with integrated development environment that make it easy to modify and improve programs. The Rodin tool provides such an environment for Event-B. The two main characteristics of the Rodin tool are its ease of use and its extensibility. The tool focuses on modelling. It is easy to modify models and try out variations of a model. The tool can also be extended easily. This makes it possible to adapt the tool to specific needs, so the tool can be adapted to fit into existing development processes instead of demanding the opposite. The Event-B wiki is a useful user and developer resource. Rodin (Rigorous Open Development Environment for Complex Systems) is an extension of Eclipse IDE (Java based).

Education and career  Suns from Flickr installation by Umbrico at New York Photo Festival, New York, 2008 Umbrico was born in Philadelphia in 1957. She graduated from the Ontario College of Art in Toronto, Canada in 1980. She obtained her M.F.A. in 1989 at the School of Visual Arts in New York.  Exhibitions  In 2010 her exhibition, As Is, at LMAK Projects featured a series of work called Broken Sets (EBay) (2009‚Äì2010), which consisted of images of broken LCD television screens that were acquired from pictures posted by eBay sellers trying to sell damaged television sets for parts. Her project Suns from Flickr started in 2006 when she found 541,795 pictures of sunsets searching the word \\"sunset\\" on the photo-sharing web site Flickr while looking for the most photographed subject (which the sunset turned out to be). She took just the suns from these pictures and made Kodak snapshot prints of them. For each installation, the title reflects the number of hits she gets searching \\"sunset\\" on Flickr at the time ‚Äì for example, the first installation was \\"541,795 Suns From Flickr\\" in 2006; subsequent installations were: ‚Äú2303057 Suns From Flickr (Partial) 9/25/07‚Äù (2007); ‚Äú3,221,717 Suns From Flickr (Partial) 3/31/08‚Äù (2008); ‚Äú5,911,253 Suns From Flickr (Partial) 8/03/09‚Äù (2009) ‚Äì the title itself becoming a comment on the ever-increasing use of web-based photo communities and a reflection of the collective content there. Her work has been published in the New York Times Magazine, on the cover and inside spreads accompanying \\"Ghosts in the Machine\\". In March 2012, Art in America featured Umbrico's work on the coverArt in America, Archives March 2012 and inside along with a short essay by the artist.

She was the wife of film producer, Daniel Toscan du Plantier. Du Plantier's death remains unsolved. Journalist Ian Bailey was arrested twice in relation to the murder, but maintains his innocence. He was tried in absentia in France after winning a legal battle against extradition. On 31 May 2019 he was convicted of murder by the Cour d'Assises de Paris and sentenced to 25 years prison. France is hoping to secure an extradition from Ireland on basis of this sentence. https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/may/31/briton- convicted-of-murder-french-film-maker-ian-bailey-sophie-toscan-du-plantier Extradition case The Sophie Toscan du Plantier incident was at the centre of an extradition case surrounding a prime suspect in the case, Ian Bailey, and the desire of the French authorities that he be brought to France to be questioned. In February 2010, a European Arrest Warrant was issued by a French magistrate which led to the High Court in Ireland granting an extradition order. This was appealed to the Supreme Court by Mr Bailey. In March 2012, the appeal was granted by the Irish Supreme Court. All five judges upheld the appeal on the ground that the French authorities had no intention to try him at this stage; four of the judges also upheld the argument that the European Arrest Warrant prohibited surrendering Mr Bailey to France because the alleged offence occurred outside French territory and there was an absence of reciprocity. In March 2017, Bailey was arrested in Ireland on foot of a European Arrest Warrant issued by the French authorities. The warrant sought to extradite Bailey to France to stand trial for the voluntary homicide of Sophie Toscan du Plantier and the High Court of Ireland endorsed the warrant. Bailey immediately instructed his legal team to oppose the application. Bailey was successful in avoiding extradition, and in 2018, a French court ruled there was \\"sufficient grounds\\" for Bailey to face trial in absentia. As Bailey was convicted of murder and sentenced to 25 years in prison May 31, 2019 by a French court the conviction is expected to lead to a new French arrest warrant and renewed extradition attempts.https://www.theguardian.com/uk- news/2019/may/31/briton-convicted-of-murder-french-film-maker-ian-bailey- sophie-toscan-du-plantier Bandon phone recordings In 2014, when it came to light that phone calls at Garda stations had been secretly recorded, there were claims that some recordings from Bandon Garda station had evidence of irregularities in the Toscan du Plantier investigation. The Fennelly Commission, a commission of investigation established in April 2014 by the then government of Ireland, includes within its terms of reference both the recordings generally and the Bandon allegations in particular. The sole member of the commission is Nial Fennelly, a retired justice of the Supreme Court.  In popular culture  The murder was the subject of a 2018 true-crime podcast miniseries titled West Cork, produced by Audible and hosted by documentarian Jennifer Forde and investigative journalist Sam Bungey.

The pair lived in the home of the Morris family, whose three sons also Charlie, John and Robert all played international football for Wales. Career Morgan began his career playing for local amateur side St Martins where he initially played as a forward. When the team's regular goalkeeper failed to arrive for a match, Morgan stepped in and took up the position permanently. He joined Chirk in 1898 where he spent two seasons as understudy to John Morris before moving to Oswestry February in 1900 to play first team football. His performances for Oswestry resulted in a move to Druids, which had suffered defeat to Morgan's Oswestry in the 1901 Welsh Cup final, where he quickly excelled, saving 12 penalties in his first season. In 1904 he won his second Welsh Cup, this time with Druids, defeating Aberdare Athletic. In 1904, Morgan joined Wrexham, where he on the Welsh Cup for a third time in 1905. He also won his first and only international cap for Wales the same year, playing against Ireland. However, he suffered a broken wrist in 1906 that nearly led to his retirement.

At the behest of famed Duke football coach Wallace Wade, the Atlantic Radio Network gave Penfield the opportunity to broadcast games while he was still a student. It was the beginning of a career in radio that spanned eight decades. Penfield graduated from Duke University in 1940.

Founded in 1985 as the feminist Th√©√¢tre Exp√©rimental des Femmes, the company changed its name to Th√©√¢tre Espace Go in 1994 and broadened its mandate. In 1988, it received the Grand Prix from the Conseil des arts de Montr√©al for its contributions to the city's culture. In 1991, it was honoured with a special prize from the Association Qu√©b√©coise des Critiques de Th√©√¢tre. In 1995, Espace Go moved to a new $5,000,000 complex on Saint Laurent Boulevard. Architect √âric Gauthier received the Prix d'Excellence from the Ordre des architectes du Qu√©bec for the building, which was formally inaugurated on March 9, 1995. The initial production in the new space was Philippe Minyana's Inventaires, directed by Louise Laprade, who was one of the co-founders of the Th√©√¢tre Exp√©rimental des Femmes. Espace Go serves as a home for several Montreal theatre companies, including Th√©√¢tre P√ÄP and Th√©√¢tre I.N.K.. Controversy The evolution of Espace Go from its roots as a feminist theatre group has not been without controversy. In January 2010, Pol Pelletier, a co-founder of the Th√©√¢tre Exp√©rimental des Femmes, took out an advertisement in Le Devoir attacking Espace Go for abandoning the founding group's feminist principles. This was not the first time that Pelletier had leveled such a charge at Espace Go: ten years earlier, a condemnatory letter from Pelletier earned a \\"terse response\\" from the theatre's then-director of the board, Louise Beaudoin.

General health affects fertility, and STI testing is an important related field. Women fertilization by day relative to ovulation. Healthy women are fertile from puberty until menopause, although fertility is typically much reduced towards the extremes of this period. The onset of puberty is typically identified by menarche and the presence of secondary sexual characteristics such as breast development, the appearance of pubic hair and changes to body fat distribution. The end of a woman's fertile years typically comes somewhat before menopause, as fertility declines to a point where establishing a viable pregnancy is very unlikely. =Ovulation testing= Various methods of predicting fertility exist, to either aid or avoid pregnancy. Stretch test Cervical mucus Cervical mucus becomes clear and stretchy during the fertile window, to allow sperm to survive in and travel through it. The consistency of fertile mucous is akin to egg white. Ovulation prediction kit Ovulation prediction kits are usually antibody tests for luteinising hormone, which peaks in urine around the time of ovulation. Some tests, such as the Clearblue fertility monitor, also test for estradiol. Electronic fertility monitors Fertility/contraception monitor A fertility monitor is an electronic device which may use various methods to assist the user with fertility awareness. A fertility monitor may analyze changes in hormone levels in urine, basal body temperature, electrical resistance of saliva and vaginal fluids, or a combination of these methods. These devices may assist in pregnancy achievement. However, at the moment there is insufficient evidence available to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of fertility monitoring on live births or pregnancies. Cervical position The cervix becomes soft, high, open and wet during the fertile window. Basal Body Temperature Charting Basal body temperature changes during the menstrual cycle. Higher levels of progesterone released during the menstrual cycle causes an abrupt increase in basal body temperature by 0.5 ¬∞C to 1 ¬∞C at the time of ovulation. This enables identification of the fertile window through the use of commercial thermometers. This test can also indicate if there are issues with ovulation. Calendar methods Because the fertile window arrives at approximately the same time each month, calendar methods can be used to predict ovulation. =Diagnosis of infertility= Physicians perform laparoscopic surgery. Women of fertile age may be infertile for a number of reasons. Various tests are available to establish reasons. Anti-M√ºllerian hormone testing Anti-M√ºllerian hormone tests allow the estimation of ovarian reserve. These give an indication of the likely remaining fertility opportunities a woman may have. Follicle stimulating hormone Tests for follicle stimulating hormone establish whether or not a woman will ovulate in any given month. This test is typically carried out on day 3 of the menstrual cycle. Hysterosalpingography Hysterosalpingography involve the inspection of the fallopian tubes and uterus, by the injection of a radiocontrast agent, to ensure the egg can pass down the tube without obstruction, and to identify uterine abnormalities. Ovarian ultrasound Pregnancy rates in ovulation induction when using antiestrogens, as functions of the size of the leading follicle as measured by transvaginal ultrasonography at days 11 - 13 (bottom scale), as well as the thickness of the endometrial lining (4 different curves). Ultrasound scans of the ovaries (optimally by transvaginal ultrasonography) may be conducted to establish the development of ovarian follicles. This can be useful particularly in the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome. Hysteroscopy Hysteroscopy is used to diagnose the presence of a number of conditions which may affect fertility, such as uterine fibroids, Asherman's syndrome, and bicornate uterus. It involves the insertion of an endoscope to produce images of the inside of the uterus. Laparoscopy Laparoscopy is used to examine the interior of the abdomen. It can be used to establish patency of the fallopian tubes, and is especially suitable for the diagnosis of endometriosis. Men Males who have gone through puberty should be fertile throughout life. Men ejaculate semen which contains sex cells called sperm. After intercourse, sperm travel to the egg through the female reproductive tract, typically causing fertilisation to occur in the fallopian tubes. Fertility testing for men involves semen testing and genetic testing, as other factors such as impotence are obvious. Semen can be tested for sperm count, sperm motility, sperm morphology, pH, volume, fructose content, and acrosome activity. Checks are also made to identify undescended testicles and retrograde ejaculation, along with medical history, such as cancer treatment, radiation, drug use, etc. In some cases the hamster zona-free ovum test may also be used to diagnose fertility. Genetic testing and chromosomal analysis can rule out some other causes of male infertility, such as Klinefelter syndrome. A recent study identified epigenetic patterns in male sperm that may contribute to infertility.

The first satellite, Elektro-L No.1, was launched on 20 January 2011. It is the first Russian weather satellite that successfully operates in geostationary orbit, and is currently the second operational Russian weather satellite. The satellites have a mass of about 1620 kg and are designed to operate for 10 years each. They are capable of producing images of the Earth's whole hemisphere in both visible and infrared frequencies, providing data for climate change and ocean monitoring in addition to their primary weather forecasting role.  Development  Elektro‚ÄìL was developed by the company NPO Lavochkin and financed from the Russian Federal Space Program 2006-2015. The satellites will be operated by and provide data for Roscosmos, Scientific Research Center of Space Hydrometeorology \\"Planeta\\" and for the Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring of Russia (Roshydromet). Elektro‚ÄìL's predecessor was the Elektro 1 satellite which was launched in 1994. Like Elektro‚ÄìL, it was also designed to operate in geostationary orbit, but never became fully operational. Along with the earlier Meteor-M series, Elekto‚ÄìL satellites are part of Russia's aim to restore its weather satellite network. Before the launch of Elektro‚ÄìL No.1, Russia had only one operational weather satellite in orbit: Meteor-M No.1, operating in an 830-km circular sun-synchronous orbit. Due to lack of satellites, Russia is forced to use meteorological data provided by American and European weather agencies. Aerospace journalist Anatoly Zak wrote that the launch of the first Elektro‚ÄìL satellite marked the \\"re-emergence of Russia's space industry after two decades of economic turmoil\\", as the spacecraft and its standardised Navigator platform were both conceived and developed after the disintegration of the Soviet Union.  Purpose  The Elektro‚ÄìL satellites are capable of providing weather analysis and forecasting both for the territory of Russia and worldwide. The satellites are able to image the entire hemisphere of Earth in visible and infrared frequencies, additionally providing data on climate change, as well as sea and ocean monitoring. An Elektro‚ÄìL satellite can also be used to receive and relay COSPAS-SARSAT emergency signals. The addition of Elektro‚ÄìL No.1 to Russia's weather satellite network is expected to make Russian weather forecasts more precise.  Spacecraft  The satellites have a mass of about 1620 kg, with the payload mass being 435 kg. Their operational lifetime is expected to be 10 years. The mean power consumption of the spacecraft is 700 W, which is satisfied by solar panels providing 1.7 kW of power. Elektro‚ÄìL has a modular design, consisting of a payload and a service module. The service module, called Navigator and developed by NPO Lavochkin, is a standardised platform which will also serve as the basis for future Russian satellites, including for space telescope Spektr-R. The spacecraft's MSU-GS imaging system is able to provide a resolution of 1 km per pixel for the two visible bands and 4 km for eight infrared bands (ranging from 800 nm to 11,500 nm). They will normally take images every 30 minutes, but in case of emergencies, the interval can be shortened to 10 minutes. The camera is an optical-mechanical scanner, sampling the visible bands at 12,576 pixels per line. Sensor data downlink to Ground Acquisition and Distribution Center uses a X-band (7.5 GHz) frequency and has a data rate of 2.56-15.36 Mbits per second, while exchange of data between regional centers in X-band (at 8.2 and 7.5 GHz) offers data rates of up to 15.36 Mbit/s.  Launches =Elektro-L No.1= The first spacecraft of the series, Elektro-L No.1, was launched at 15.29 Moscow Time (12:29 GMT) on 20 January 2011 from Pad 45 at Baikonur Cosmodrome. The launch vehicle used was a Zenit-2SB, developed by the Ukrainian Yuzhnoe Design Bureau. The rocket's third stage was a newly developed Fregat-SB, a variation of the baseline Fregat, developed by Russia's NPO Lavochkin. At 15.37, the second stage separated and the Fregat-SB continued lifting the spacecraft into geostationary orbit. The satellite separated from the upper stage at 00.28 on 21 January. On 21 January, Roscosmos announced that the spacecraft was fully operational. \\"We have completed the first series of the testing. The spacecraft is fully operational\\", Deputy Head Anatoly Shilov said. The satellite's final orbital position in geostationary orbit is 159.1 degrees east longitude. =Elektro-L No.2= The next satellite in the series, Elektro-L No.2, initially slated for launch in 2013, was launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome on 11 December 2015 at 13:45 UTC. The launch vehicle was a Zenit-3F with Fregat-SB upper stage. It was the rocket's 83rd and possibly last flight . =Elektro-L No.3= The third satellite in the series Elektro-L No.3, was launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome on 24 December 2019 at 12:03 UTC by a Proton-M rocket. This satellite's orbit can be tracked at uphere.space  References   External links  *Video (24:21) - Planet Earth from Space - viewed from geostationary \\"Elektro-L\\" weather satellite (timelapse - October, 2011 to March, 2012). * - Details about MSU-GS camera system (in Russian).

It is situated in rural Mberengwa in Chief Mposi's area and it became the first secondary school in the district to offer Form IV in 1966 and Form VI in 1986. The school is known for its excellent academic achievements with one of the students achieving the best Rhodesian Junior Certificate (RJC) results in the whole country in 1961, a record that was repeated in 1987 when Osborn Vhevha became the best student nationally in the Cambridge 'O' Level examinations. History Chegato High School was founded in 1957 as Chegato Secondary School. The idea and discussions of a secondary school in Belingwe (now Mberengwa), however, began much earlier than 1957. In 1953, the Rhodesian Department of African Education (as it was then called) advised and encouraged the Church of Sweden Mission (CSM) to start secondary school education. The first Form I class opened at Musume in January 1954 where it shared facilities with the Primary Teachers' Lower (PTL) Training School and both schools were under the headship of Mr A Engdahl. The Mission Council (the Church of Sweden Mission decision making body) decided to move the secondary school to Mnene in 1955 with Mr Nordesjo as the principal of the whole school establishment. Mr Enoch Dumbutshena who later became Zimbabwe's Chief Justice was one of the staff members. The mission authorities decided that the secondary school should be permanently placed in the new buildings at Chegato Mission which at that time consisted of a chapel, the evangelist and pastor's houses and a primary day school nearby. Initial funding for the secondary school came from the Rhodesian government to the tune of 7 500 pounds. Mr S. Fredricksson, the mission builder was given the task of drawing plans and erecting the buildings. Government assistance was not available when structures for Forms III and IV were erected. The Church Council which superseded the old Mission Council guaranteed 5000 pounds for the new buildings and this money was eventually received from SIDA. The money was used to build a laboratory, a large library, a dining hall, assembly hall and several staff houses. In February 1957, a ceremony attended by Dean A. H Albrekson, Chief Mposi, local guests particularly the nearby Lemba Masarira clan, staff and the Director of Education from Salisbury (now Harare) Mr Finkle, was held to officially open Chegato Secondary School, which during the same year had taken up permanent residence in the new buildings. Forms I and II then consisted of 72 students of which 18 were girls. In 1961 Chegato Secondary School was connected to the national telephone network and the following year it was connected to the national electricity grid owing to, among other advantages, the discovery of emeralds at the nearby Sandawana Mine and also the strategic location of Jeka Clinic which happened to lie along the same route of access. In 1965 the first 20 students were admitted into the much longed for Form III and the following year the pioneering Form IV students sat for their Cambridge School Certificate. Mr T. Bergman was the principal of Chegato Secondary School between 1957 and 1966, although after every five years he went on furlough back to Sweden leaving a stand in - (1958: Mr Engdahl, 1964: Mr O. L Mlilo). Bergman resigned in 1966 to take up a new position as the Evangelical Lutheran Church-Rhodesia (ELC-R) Education Secretary and was replaced by Mr H. E Perrson who had arrived from Sweden in September 1965. During this period the school employed and/or enrolled some African teachers and students who became important luminaries in post- independence Zimbabwe - Zephania Matchaba Hove, Jeffias Ngwenya, Phineas Makhurane, Byron Hove, Eleck Mashingaidze and several others. Mr E Chenyika Hove took over as headmaster of Chegato Secondary School between 1969 and 1980 and took the school into exile in Bulawayo (1979-1980) when Zimbabwe's liberation war intensified. Mr I. M Shumba took over as headmaster between 1981 and 2000 when he resigned from the post to join politics. During this period Mr Shumba modernised the school by successfully mobilising funds to build several new hostels, a new complex housing biology, physics and chemistry laboratories, a lecture theatre and several staff houses. Most of these structures were erected by the new school builder Mr Chikomo Musvaburi and his contract workers. Mr Shumba left Mr T. Hove as acting headmaster in 1986 when he took study leave. Rev R.P Tangawamira was the headmaster between 2000 and 2014 and brought back Chegato High School into the fold of top 100 high schools in Zimbabwe, a phenomenal rise after the disastrous effects of the Zimbabwean crisis that slowed down from 2008. At the end of Mr Bergman's tenure as headmaster in 1966, the school had 6 classes with almost 200 students and 9 teachers. As of 2010 Chegato High School has slightly over 700 students and about 35 teachers. When Rev R. P Tangawamira retired Morris Ngara took over as the new principal and has begun work on landscaping the grounds of the school. Notable alumni =Politics= The school has produced some of the finest politicians who served in the Zimbabwean parliament, notably Honourable Joram Gumbo, Honourable Isaiah Masvayamwando Shumba (now late), Honourable Costain Muguti and Honourable Dr Byron Hove (now late). =Academia= Most high profile universities in South Africa, Zimbabwe and the international community are served by some of the best brains incubated at Chegato High School. Contemporary academics who are alumni of the school include some of the following: Dr. Ngwabi Bhebe: Professor and Vice Chancellor of Midlands State University Dr. Phineas Makhurane: Professor and former Vice Chancellor of National University of Science and Technology Dr. Samuel Ravengai: Associate Professor and Head of Department of Theatre and Performance at the University of the Witwatersrand Dr. Nicholas Nyika: Senior Lecturer in Literature at University of South Africa Dr. Wallace Chuma: Associate Professor in Media Studies, at the University of Cape Town Dr. Tendai Moyo-Dube: Learner Support at University of Derby Dr. Takavafira Zhou: President of Progressive Teachers' Union Dr. Musara Lubombo: Post Graduate Research Adviser University of KwaZulu-Natal.

The leak, which began on 28 November 2010, occurred when the website of WikiLeaks‚Äîan international new media non-profit organisation that publishes submissions of otherwise unavailable documents from anonymous news sources and news leaks‚Äîstarted to publish classified documents of detailed correspondence‚Äîdiplomatic cables‚Äîbetween the United States Department of State and its diplomatic missions around the world. Since the initial release date, WikiLeaks is releasing further documents every day. 3,166 of the 251,287 diplomatic cables obtained by WikiLeaks are from the US Embassy in Colombo, Sri Lanka. War crimes In a cable dated 15 January 2010 on the subject of war crimes accountability, the US ambassador in Colombo Patricia A. Butenis implicated President Mahinda Rajapaksa in alleged war crimes committed in the final months of the Sri Lankan Civil War. Butenis pointed out \\"that responsibility for many of the alleged [war] crimes rests with the country's senior civilian and military leadership, including President Rajapaksa and his brothers (Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and Basil Rajapaksa) and opposition candidate General Fonseka. Butenis stated that only \\"few tentative steps\\" had been taken on accountability and that there was little likelihood of anyone being held accountable for the war crimes, stating \\"There are no examples ... of a regime undertaking wholesale investigations of its own troops or senior officials for war crimes while that regime or government remained in power\\". Butenis believed that there was a difference of opinion between the Sri Lankan Tamils living in Sri Lanka and those in the diaspora as to how to pursue the accountability issue. For the diaspora accountability was a \\"top-priority\\" but Tamils in Sri Lanka were more \\"pragmatic in what they can expect\\". The Sri Lankan Tamils were more concerned with improving their rights, freedoms and economic prospects. They believed pushing for accountability was unrealistic and counter-productive. They were fearful of the repercussions if the war crimes issue was pursued aggressively but they hoped that the issue would be dealt with some time in the future. Most Sri Lankan Tamil politicians were supportive of national reconciliation and ethnic cohesion. They feared \\"political or even physical attack\\" if they raised the issue of accountability and were focusing \\"on more immediate economic and social concerns\\". Rajavarothiam Sampanthan, leader of the Tamil National Alliance, the largest political party representing the Tamils, did not want to raise the war crimes issue in Parliament because he feared retaliation. Sampanthan believed it was important for the truth to be exposed but that the Tamils were \\"vulnerable\\" on the issue. Pathmini Sithamparanathan, a TNA MP with close links to the Tamil Tigers, believed that the truth about what happened in the final months of the civil war would eventually come out but \\"now was not the time for war crimes-type investigations\\". Mano Ganesan, leader of the Democratic People's Front, believed that \\"accountability was a divisive issue and the focus now had to be on uniting to rid the country of the Rajapaksas\\". For many local Tamil politicians accountability was not an immediate concern, they were instead focused on \\"bread-and-butter issues\\" such as IDP releases, Sinhala colonisation of traditional Tamil regions and re- developing the local economy. The Boston Globe, later commented that \\"No foreign leader has fared worse in the cables released by WikiLeaks than Sri Lanka‚Äôs President Mahinda Rajapaksa\\", regarding Butenis' implication of President Rajapaksa in the alleged war crimes. Human rights In a cable dated 22 January 2010 on the subject of progress on key issues, the US ambassador in Colombo Patricia Butenis stated that a government led by General Sarath Fonseka \\"would be interested in moving forward more quickly than the Rajapaksa government\\" on the post-civil war issues in Sri Lanka. Butenis believed that there had been a \\"dramatic improvement in the treatment of IDPs\\" but noted that \\"Large numbers...have not yet returned to their places of origin\\". Disappearances had \\"experienced a steady and significant decline\\" since the end of the civil war. Use of child soldiers by the Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Pulikal, a government backed paramilitary group, had also declined. On the issue of war crimes Butenis repeated the comments she had made on the on cable dated 15 January 2010, namely that \\"responsibility for many of the alleged [war] crimes rests with the country‚Äôs senior civilian and military leadership, including President Rajapaksa and his brothers and opposition candidate General Fonseka\\" and that \\"there are no examples of a sitting regime undertaking wholesale investigations of its own troops or senior officials for war crimes\\". In a cable dated 11 June 2009 on the subject of Commonwealth engagement on international issues, the Deputy Chief of Mission at the US embassy in London Richard LeBaron detailed a discussion by the Political Officer with Amitav Banerji, the Commonwealth's Political Director. Banerji said the human rights situation in Sri Lanka had been raised ‚Äúinformally and off the record‚Äù by the UK government at a meeting of Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group, resulting in \\"a difficult conversation\\" with the Sri Lankan Foreign Minister. Banerji also confirmed that Sri Lanka‚Äôs offer to host the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting had been turned down due to concerns about \\"lending international credibility to the [Sri Lankan] Government‚Äôs actions\\". Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam In a diplomatic cable dated 12 June 2007, Blake points out the human-rights violations by the LTTE. The cable reports on a meeting that \\"PolOff\\" had with a \\"private organization that provides assistance to refugees\\" (name of organization is redacted in the copy of the cable leaked). The organization \\"described the LTTE's 'one person per family' forced conscription program\\". The organization \\"stated that the Tigers require at least one person between the ages of 18 and 35 per family to fight for the LTTE.\\" The cable reports the organization \\"noted the average age of LTTE 'recruits' is 17 years old.\\" The use of the Tamils Rehabilitation Organization (TRO) by the LTTE to extract money from INGOs was also discussed in the cables as such, the organization \\"told us the LTTE had ordered INGOs to provide all project funding through local NGOs, which are managed collectively by the Tamil Rehabilitation Organization (TRO). For example, [the organization] receives money in its bank account from its headquarters or from international donors, then deposits the money into a separate bank account operated by a local NGO. The local NGO's director is always a member of TRO, as are many other members of the local NGO staff. The TRO representative withdraws the money from the local NGO's account, provides a cut to the LTTE, and distributes the rest to accomplish the particular project\\". The chief facilitator of the 2002 peace process, Norwegian minister Erik Solheim sees Velupillai Prabhakaran, the leader of the LTTE as \\"completely isolated and has no understanding of the South, much less the broader world\\". He speculated that Prabhakaran has not spoken to a Sinhalese in ten years. The LTTE theoretician, Anton Balasingham was \\"the heavyweight thinker\\" of the organization. Prabhakaran had once told Japanese ambassador Seiichiro Otsuka that his elder son Charles Anthony was studying martial arts. Paramilitary groups In a cable dated 18 May 2007 the US embassy in Colombo alleged that the Sri Lankan government was colluding with paramilitary groups in criminal activities including extrajudicial killings, abductions, child trafficking, extortion and prostitution. The cable detailed eyewitness accounts of paramilitary activities. According to Blake paramilitary groups such as the Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Pulikal and Eelam People's Democratic Party have helped the Sri Lankan government fight the Tamil Tigers, kidnap Tamil Tiger collaborators and \\"give the GSL (Government of Sri Lanka) a measure of deniability\\". The paramilitary groups also compete with the Tamil Tigers for public support and new recruits. The paramilitaries \\"keep critics of the GSL fearful and quiet\\". The Sri Lankan government hopes to turn Karuna and Douglas Devananda into \\"pro-GSL political leaders in the East and North\\", ensuring long term control over these areas even if devolution is granted. The Sri Lankan government under President Chandrika Kumaratunga gave direct financial assistance to the paramilitary groups. Financial pressures had forced the government of President Rajapaksa to stop this assistance but it continues to turn \\"a blind eye to extortion and kidnapping for ransom\\" by the EPDP and TMVP. According to one eyewitness Defence Secretary Gothabaya Rajapaksa gave authority for the EPDP and TMVP to \\"collect\\" money from Tamil businessmen. The cable concluded that \\"this may account for the sharp rise in lawlessness, especially extortion and kidnapping\\". One eyewitness stated that the Sri Lankan Military wanted to clamp down on the paramilitaries but had been prevented by Gothabaya Rajapaksa because they were doing the \\"work\\" the military could not. Another stated that MPs, Muslims as well as Tamil, were fearful that \\"the GSL will use Karuna [TMVP] to assassinate them\\". Others said that the assassination of Tamil MP Joseph Pararajasingham had been set up by Karuna/TMVP with the help of EPDP leader Douglas Devananda and that Karuna/TMVP cadres had assassinated Nadarajah Raviraj, another Tamil MP. According to eyewitnesses the Sri Lankan government allows the TMVP/Karuna to \\"recruit children forcibly from within IDP camps in the East\\". The average age of a TMVP/Karuna recruit was 14. The TMVP/Karuna had resorted to criminal activities to raise funds. They had stolen food and supplies destined for the IDP camps and sold them on. The operated prostitution rings in the IDP camps to \\"take care of\\" GSL soldiers. Women were forced into prostitution by the TMVP/Karuna. This had forced some families to marry off their daughters at the age of 12 in order to reduce the risk of them being forced into prostitution. The cable stated that despite being a registered political party, the EPDP continued to be \\"a feared paramilitary group\\". With the assistance of the Sri Lanka Army the EPDP was \\"able to conduct extortion, abductions, extrajudicial killings and other criminal acts without fear of consequences\\" according to eyewitnesses. The EPDP was involved in child trafficking rings, boys being taken to work camps and girls into prostitution rings in India and Malaysia. The EPDP, like the TMVP/Karuna, forced women into prostitution rings servicing Sri Lankan soldiers. The EPDP also ran illicit alcohol smuggling ring using child \\"mules\\". The cable concluded that the preponderance of eyewitness accounts of paramilitary activities and the extent of corroboration pointed \\"to a pattern of GSL complicity with paramilitary groups on multiple levels\\". The cable states that \\"top leaders of its security establishment may be providing direction to these paramilitaries\\". The Sri Lankan government denies any links with paramilitary groups and claims it has made efforts to improve human rights. Blake however believes that these efforts are \\"aimed more at improving Sri Lanka‚Äôs image abroad and have yet to produce concrete improvements\\". 2002 Peace process A dispatch of cables ranging from 2002 to 2006 discuss the details of 2002 Norway brokered peace process in Sri Lanka. Following is a few points that were not widely known before. Anton Balasingham the chief political strategist and chief negotiator of the LTTE, in a meeting with Milinda Moragoda, a key minister of the 2001-04 UNP government, jokingly (and accurately) used the term \\"extortion\\" in referring to his organization¬¥s so-called \\"taxation\\" policies. The minister described Balasingham as \\"sincere, amiable, flexible\\", much easier to deal with, and less dogmatic than he would have earlier thought. On a separate occasion, he points out the LTTE's April 2003 decision to walk away from the peace process, was tactical \\"shock therapy\\". UK-Sri Lanka relations In a cable dated 7 May 2009 the Acting Deputy Chief of Mission at the US embassy in London Mark Tokola detailed the United Kingdom government's views and actions on Sri Lanka. According to Tim Waite, the Sri Lanka team leader at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, much of the UK government's interest in Sri Lanka had been due to the \\"very vocal\\" Tamil diaspora. Attention had been paid particularly because a general election was due and many Tamils lived in marginal Labour constituencies. UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband had told Waite \\"he was spending 60 percent of his time at the moment on Sri Lanka\\". The UK's main concerns were the civilians caught in the conflict zone, humanitarian access and IDP needs. According to Waite Miliband had been \\"disappointed\\" that the Sri Lankan government did not allow Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt to join Miliband and Bernard Kouchner when they visited Sri Lanka in April 2009. The British parliamentary delegation which visited Sri Lanka in May 2009 found the conditions in the IDP camps to be \\"not nearly as good as it should\\". Waite claimed India was \\"ambivalent\\" on the Sri Lanka issue and did not want \\"undertake any heavy lifting\\" because the issue was \\"too sensitive\\". According to Waite the UK government had decided to support the US government in wanting the International Monetary Fund Stand-By Arrangement (loan) with Sri Lanka to be delayed.

Among his bronze sculptures are Helge from 1925 and Hode from 1928. In the 1920s he also designed pieces of furniture. In the early 1930s he co-designed a telephone for Elektrisk Bureau. It was claimed to be the world's first \\"hookless\\" bakelite telephone; that is, the first telephone where the cradle, or receiver hook, was integrated into the all-bakelite body. The phone went into production in 1932 as the Ericsson model DBH1001. The engineering design of this model was made by Norwegian electrical engineer Johan Christian Bjerknes (1889‚Äì1983). Heiberg was responsible for the stylistic design. Heiberg was appointed a professor at the Norwegian National Academy of Fine Arts from 1935 to 1955, except during the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, when he was fired in 1941. In autumn 1941 he started secretly running an undercover art academy in Oslo, together with fellow professor Axel Revold. Their academy was called \\"The Factory\\" () because its first location was in a closed corset factory. It was later located at Lauritz Falk's home and at Johannes Sejersted B√∏dtker's atelier at Holmenkollen. Heiberg was the director of the Norwegian National Academy of Fine Arts from 1946 to 1955. In 1956 he was decorated Commander of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav.

Early career Gleditsch was born in Eschendorf, near Pirna, on 15 August 1653, son of pastor Georg Gleditsch (1615-65) and his wife Catherine (n√©e Nikolai, 1624-1671). After his father died when he was young, he attended the Thomas School in Leipzig. For financial reasons, he began to work for Elert Schumacher, a bookseller in Wittenberg, working as an assistant there until 1680. In 1681 he joined the publishing business of the late John Frederick Fritsch, whose widow Catarina Margaretha he married in November 1681. In the following years he developed the already prestigious company into a prominent scientific publisher, famous mainly for the publication in Leipzig of the Acta Eruditorum. He brought out the first issue of this work in cooperation with the great Erben publishing house in 1682. Independent publisher At the end of 1693 Gledistch handed the business over to his stepson, Thomas Fritsch, and founded his own publishing bookshop. Within a few years this enterprise became important as well, excelling in lavish publications. These included the main history of the Reformation, Seckendorff's Commentarius de Lutheranismo, Ziegler's Schauplatz und Labyrinth, Lohenstein's Arminius and the major biblical and theological works of Johann Tarnow (Tarnovius), Salomo Glassius, Benedikt Carpzov der J√ºngere and Valerius Herberger. Gledistch and his brother Johann Ludwig, stepfather of Moritz Georg Weidmann, persuaded the leading Dutch booksellers to send their works to the Leipzig fair instead of to Frankfurt, a major breakthrough for the book trade in the city. In addition to the great authors, Gleditsch achieved success in the two key growth sectors of the book market of the early 18th Century: encyclopedias and journals. He published John Huebner's Reale Staats-und Zeitungs-Lexicon (States and places lexicon) (1704), which with a supplementary volume published in 1712 became the indispensable reference when reading to the newspapers. It allowed people to look up places and countries that were named without explanation in the papers, as was the convention of the day. From the encyclopedias of Gottlieb Siegmund Corvinus (alias Amaranthe), he compiled the Woman's Lexicon (1715). Among the journals he published Acta Eruditorum in Latin, supplemented in 1712 by the German Acta Eruditorum, from which the leading review of historical writings developed. Gleditsch's companies created their synergy effects. Books published by the Gledisch were often discussed and promoted by his journals. Gleditsch died, aged 62, in Leipzig.

She played a central role in shaping the early teaching and curriculum of the University of Queensland.University of Queensland's first lecturers showing from back RJ Cholmeley (Classics), Hermiene Ulrich (Mod Languages), Elton Mayo (Philosophy), Front HC Richards (Geology), T Parnell (Physics) JP Tivey (Engineering), EOG Shann (History), Brisbane. Photograph used with the permission of the University of Queensland, Fryer Library  Early life  Hermiene Ulrich (later Hermiene Parnell after her marriage) was born in 1885 in Victoria, Australia to German and Irish parents, and was raised around Ararat. Her family moved to Melbourne so that she and her siblings could attend school. Ulrich attended the Presbyterian Ladies College. Ulrich went on to study at the University of Melbourne from 1906-1910. She took her B.A. with first class honours in the modern languages in 1909, and then went on to study her M.A. completing this in 1911. She undertook a Dip. Ed in 1913, winning three scholarships over the course of these studies.  Career  Ulrich applied for a lecturer's position at the newly formed University of Queensland in 1911. She was hired as an Assistant Lecturer, the first woman to be employed as a lecturer at the University. Possibly reflecting the attitudes of the era to women in higher education, she was not upgraded to a full lecturer despite creating the curriculum for the first intake of Arts students in English, French and German. She was to be unofficial head of the Department, until the appointment of Professor Jeremiah Joseph Stable. Ulrich married Thomas Parnell, a fellow University of Melbourne graduate, who had also been appointed to a lecturing position at the University of Queensland in 1913. Women were not permitted to work after marriage at this point in time, but Mrs Parnell was granted teaching positions in 1913 and 1915-1918, as male members of staff began to enlist in World War I. At the conclusion of the war, Parnell was again released from the University.  Memberships and Societies  Parnell had been active on the public speaking circuit during the War, speaking at the Brisbane Theosophical Society and others. She attracted the attention of Margaret Thorp, a leader in Brisbane's peace movement, and John Latham, who were both impressed by her oratory skills, as much as her moderate views. Parnell was a member of the Scribblers ladies literary society in Brisbane in 1911-1912. She was President of the Lyceum Club in 1924-1925. She was a member and President of the Women's Club at UQ and helped to establish the Women's College at UQ. Parnell was also an active member of the Workers Educational Association (WEA), whose purpose was to bring the study of literature to a wider audience non-University audience. Her lectures on Chaucer and Shakespeare showed her continued interest in early English literature, and she had introduced Chaucerian studies into the curriculum at UQ whilst she had been lecturer there.  Legacy  Parnell's work as a teacher and designer of the early curriculum at the University of Queensland was overshadowed by that of her successors. Her impact on an entire generation of younger scholars is visible from curriculum and examination records, lecture scripts from the Queensland branch of the Worker's Educational Association, and her participation on the Brisbane public-speaking circuit, and entries in journals.Louise D'Arcens, \\"'She ensample was by good techynge': Hermiene Ulrich and Chaucer under Capricorn,\\" in: Eminent Chaucerians?

They are native to Paraguay. Description Like other members of the genus Acromyrmex and the closely related genus Atta, Acromyrmex pubescens are commonly known as \\"leafcutter ants\\". A. pubescens has four pairs of spines and a rough exoskeleton, features which distinguish it and other members of the genus Acromyrmex from the genus Atta. The pair of front spines are longer than the pair of middle spines, similar to Acromyrmex lundii, but unlike A. lundii, A. pubescens is covered with dense sometimes overlapping fuzz on their bodies. Taxonomy Acromyrmex pubescens were first described by the Italian entomologist Carlo Emery in 1905. They were originally classified as a subspecies of Acromyrmex lundii because of their structural similarity. They were named 'pubescens' (Latin for \\"downy\\") because of the presence of thick fuzzy hair that covers most of their bodies in contrast to the relatively bare A. lundii. A careful reexamination by the American entomologist Alexander L. Wild in 2007 resulted in their reclassification as a separate species. Ecology A. pubescens, like most leafcutter ants, subsist mostly through a mutualistic relationship with fungi of the genus Leucocoprinus. They cultivate the fungi with masticated leaves taken from nearby trees. They are mostly found in isolated 'islands' of trees found in Paraguayan chaco savannahs.

Turkish subjects habitually resident in Palestine (excluding Transjordan) on the first day of August 1925 automatically became citizens unless they opted to reject it. Many other classes of people were able to apply for citizenship, which would be granted at the discretion of the High Commissioner. Although the nature of Mandatory Palestine's citizenship had been debated within the British government since 1920, the main reason it was delayed was that Turkish citizens were officially enemy aliens until the Treaty of Lausanne was ratified in 1923. =Rights= Palestinian citizens had the right of abode in Palestine, but were not British subjects, and were instead considered British protected persons. After 1948 Mandatory Palestine passports ceased to be valid on the termination of the Mandate on 15 May 1948. Even so, in the early 1950s, United Nations officials described the \\"worn dog-eared Palestine passport issued in Mandate days by a government that no longer legally exists\\" as \\"mementos of identity that were treasured by refugees\\". Israeli, All-Palestine Government passports and Jordanian passports were offered to former British Mandate subjects according to the citizenship they acquired in the aftermath of the 1948 Arab- Israeli War. A significant number of Arab Palestinians, especially in the Gaza Strip and those who found refuge in Syria and Lebanon, remained stateless.

It is in effect a trench firing step hardened to protect against small-arms fire and grenades and raised to improve the field of fire.  Etymology  The origin of the term is disputed. It has been widely assumed to be a jocular reference to the perceived similarity of the fortifications to the cylindrical and hexagonal boxes in which medical pills were once sold; also, the first German concrete pillboxes discovered by the Allies in Belgium were so small and light that they were easily tilted or turned upside down by the nearby explosion of even medium (240mm) shells.Hellis, John. \\"Why the name Pillbox?\\" Pillbox Study Group However, it seems more likely that it originally alluded to pillar boxes, with a comparison being drawn between the loophole on the pillbox and the letter-slot on the pillar box. The term is found in print in The Times on 2 August 1917, following the beginning of the Third Battle of Ypres; and in The Scotsman on 17 September 1917, following the German withdrawal onto the Hindenburg Line. Other unpublished occurrences have been found in war diaries and similar documents of about the same date; and in one instance, as \\"Pillar Box\\", as early as March 1916.  Characteristics  The concrete nature of pillboxes means that they are a feature of prepared positions. Some pillboxes were designed to be prefabricated and transported to their location for assembly. During World War I, Sir Ernest William Moir produced a design for concrete machine-gun pillboxes constructed from a system of interlocking precast concrete blocks, with a steel roof. Around 1500 Moir pillboxes were eventually produced (with blocks cast at Richborough in Kent) and sent to the Western Front in 1918. Pillboxes are often camouflaged in order to conceal their location and to maximize the element of surprise. They may be part of a trench system, form an interlocking line of defence with other pillboxes by providing covering fire to each other (defence in depth), or they may be placed to guard strategic structures such as bridges and jetties. Pillboxes were hard to defeat and required artillery, anti-tank weapons or grenades to overcome.  Uses  The French Maginot Line built between the world wars consisted of a massive bunker and tunnel complex, but as most of it was below ground little could be seen from the ground level. The exception were the concrete blockhouses, gun turrets, pillboxes and cupolas which were placed above ground to allow the garrison of the Maginot line to engage an attacking enemy. Between the Abyssinian Crisis of 1936 and World War II, the British built about 200 pillboxes on the island of Malta for defence in case of an Italian invasion. Fewer than 100 pillboxes still exist, and most are found on the northeastern part of the island. A few of them have been restored and are cared for, but many others were demolished. Some pillboxes are still being destroyed nowadays as the authorities do not consider them to have any architectural or historic value, despite heritage NGOs calling to preserve them. About 28,000 pillboxes and other hardened field fortifications were constructed in England in 1940 as part of the British anti-invasion preparations of World War II. About 6,500 of these structures still survive. Pillboxes for the Czechoslovak border fortifications were built before World War II in Czechoslovakia in defence against a German attack. None of these were actually used against their intended enemy during the German invasion, but some were used against the advancing Soviet armies in 1945. The Japanese also made use of pillboxes in their fortifications of Iwo Jima.  Notes   References     External links  * Category:Fortifications by type .

After joining the East India Company he was sent to India in 1811, where he remained in various administrative posts until 1842. Smith passed through the training college of the East India Company at Haileybury and Imperial Service College in 1807 and started his service in India in 1811. There he continued his education at Fort William College in Calcutta, graduating with distinction. Most of his stay was in the magistracies of Bengal, the excellence of his service leading to an appointment to the Supreme Council of India. The following year saw his resignation for family reasons and his return to England. From 1827 Smith had been based in Arrah, some 40 miles from Patna, and it is likely that he met Sir Charles D'Oyly there. He became a close friend of D'Oyly, who was related by marriage, and both had served in the Bengal Civil Service. While in India, Smith acquired a reputation as ornithological artist and collaborated in producing two books with Sir Charles D'Oyly - The Feathered Game of Hindostan (1828) and Oriental Ornithology (1829), Smith depicting the birds and the foliage, D'Oyly the background landscapes. Smith may have also influenced some of the artists of local artists of the Patna Qalam school who were employed by Charles D'Oyly. Smith stayed at the Cape of Good Hope from 1837 until 1839 to recover his health. As a result, he and D'Oyly collaborated on a third volume, The Birds, Flowers, and Scenery of the Cape, and finished 56 plates, though the book was never published. From 1849 to 1860 Smith worked on a critique of the 300 paintings in Florence's Pitti Gallery. The entire work was lost with the sinking of the steamer Black Prince off the coast of Portugal.

It has been used to exploit PDF format and Adobe Flash. A just-in-time compiler (JIT) by definition produces code as its data. Since the purpose is to produce executable data, a JIT compiler is one of the few types of programs that can not be run in a no-executable-data environment. Because of this, JIT compilers are normally exempt from data execution prevention. A JIT spray attack does heap spraying with the generated code. To produce exploit code from JIT, an idea from Dion Blazakis; is used. The input program, usually JavaScript or ActionScript, typically contains numerous constant values that can be erroneously executed as code. For example, the XOR operation could be used:Writing JIT-Spray Shellcode for fun and profit, Alexey Sintsov, var a = (0x11223344^0x44332211^0x44332211^ ...); JIT then will transform bytecode to native x86 code like: 0: b8 44 33 22 11 5: 35 11 22 33 44 a: 35 11 22 33 44 The attacker then uses a suitable bug to redirect code execution into the newly generated code. For example, a buffer overflow or use after free bug could allow the attack to modify a function pointer or return address. This causes the CPU to execute instructions in a way that was unintended by the JIT authors. The attacker is usually not even limited to the expected instruction boundaries; it is possible to jump into the middle of an intended instruction to have the CPU interpret it as something else. As with non-JIT ROP attacks, this may be enough operations to usefully take control of the computer. Continuing the above example, jumping to the second byte of the \\"mov\\" instruction results in an \\"inc\\" instruction: 1: 44 2: 33 22 4: 11 35 11 22 33 44 a: 35 11 22 33 44 Computer hardware that allows jumping into the middle of an instruction includes x86, x86-64, and ARM. Although especially effective on this type of hardware, JIT spraying works on other systems as well. To protect against JIT spraying, the JIT code can be disabled or made less predictable for the attacker.

It is approximately midway between Hereford and Ross-on-Wye. History The land at Harewood Park was part of a royal hunting estate, which was granted by King John to the Knights Templar of the nearby village of Garway in 1215. By 1312 it was recorded as containing a hall, grange and chapel. After the Knights Templar were disbanded, the estate passed to the Knights Hospitaller until the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII. The land was then sold, first to the brothers Robert and Hugh Thornhill and then, in 1547, to the Browne family who built a large house on the site. Around 1651-54, the house was bought by Bennet Hoskyns MP, who had the unusual distinction of both being appointed a High Sheriff under Cromwell, and later being made a baronet by Charles II. The estate remained in the ownership of the Hoskyns family for almost 300 years. In 1781 the Tudor house was demolished and a new house, set in parkland with terraced walks, was built on the site. The house was again substantially rebuilt in 1839 by the 7th Baronet, Sir Hungerford Hoskyns, who had built an 11-bay, three-storey entrance front, featuring a grand porch with Tuscan columns, and two wings. The chapel was rebuilt in 1862. The declining fortunes of the Hoskyns family resulted in the house being sold in 1892 to Henry Harrison Parry, who also owned a brewery in Leicester. On his death in 1908, he was buried in the graveyard of the estate chapel of St Denis. The estate was then owned for eight years by his brother Joseph, and then by Henry Parry‚Äôs eldest daughter, Evelyn Foster. She sold it in 1927. In 1941 Harewood Park was sold to the Trustees of Guy's Hospital. It was used as an auxiliary hospital during World War II, but was deemed surplus to requirements after the war. The building decayed, its fixtures and fittings were sold off in 1959, and the shell of the house was used for demolition practice by the Royal Engineers. A modern bungalow, described as \\"wildly inappropriate\\", Ross-on-Wye Civic Society: The Harewood Park Regeneration Project was built on the site in the 1960s. Redevelopment In May 2000, the estate was purchased by the Duchy of Cornwall as part of its acquisition of property owned by Prudential plc. In 2003, plans were prepared for what the Duchy described as a \\"rural regeneration project\\", involving the restoration of three groups of buildings at Home Farm, Grange Farm, and Harewood Park itself, at an estimated cost of ¬£8-9 million. The architect is Craig Hamilton. Craig Hamilton Architects Home Farm and Grange Farm are intended to be developed as cottages and workshops. Overall, the intention is to undertake restoration on the basis of principles of environmental sustainability, and including the use of local sandstone from a reopened local quarry, and locally sourced timber. New woodland was to be planted, and schemes were included to retain water run-off and filter sewage in reed filtration beds. Prince Charles is reportedly personally involved in details of the scheme. The Duchy's website states: > When complete the project will consist of a replacement principal dwelling > as a focal point of the estate, the restoration of a Grade II listed stable > block and former chapel together with the sympathetic rebuilding of eight > additional dwellings linked with more than of high quality offices offering > a combination of residential and workplace facilities for up to 100 people. The new house will be built on the site of the historic house. Three possible designs have been drawn up for the replacement house, for which outline planning consent was granted by Herefordshire Council in 2007. The agreed proposal is for a six-bedroom house, considerably scaled down from the original designs put forward in 2004. Nick Britten, Daily Telegraph, A starter palace for Prince William and Kate?, 31 January 2007 The proposed design is intended to echo that of existing stable blocks on the site, with arches influenced by the designs of Sir John Soane. According to Hamilton: > Three designs have been prepared for the site and two of these have received > planning consent. The first design refers to the work of Schinkel in > Potsdam. The second is a synthesis of Greek and Roman references. The third > design has developed out of the triumphal arch motif which is repeated in > the design of the surviving early 19th century stables on the site. The new > house is to be built out of local sandstone quarried on the Estate. In 2016 the walled garden and former fishing lake were restored. Media speculation The Duchy of Cornwall denied that the new house would be the home of any member of the royal family, although there was local and national speculation that the house will become the main residence of Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge.The independent, The other newlyweds: Wills and Kate don't need to worry but how are the commoners coping with finding a marital home?, 15 April 2011Daily Telegraph, Royal wedding: what the future holds for Prince William and Kate Middleton, 14 April 2011 This speculation has died after Anmer Hall on the Sandringham estate was named in April 2013 as the official country residence of their royal highnesses when the current lease expired.

Early life George Tod was born in Suffield, Connecticut, and graduated from Yale in 1797. He taught school, studied law at Litchfield Law School, and was admitted to the bar in Connecticut. He married Sallie Isaacs in 1797. She was sister in law of Governor Ingersoll. Children Charlotte and Jonathan were born in Connecticut.Upton 1910, p. 80 In 1808, he took on as an apprentice, the young Jesse Root Grant, the future father of Ulysses S.

M'Fadden, Pease held that this was in conflict with the United States Constitution, which stated \\"in suits of common law when the value shall exceed $20, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved,\\" and the State Constitution, which stated \\"the right of trial by jury shall be inviolate.\\"Upton 1910, p. 84 This decision established judicial review of legislative decisions.

Rickert was born in Dover, Ohio to Francis E. Rickert, a pharmacist, and Caroline Josephine Newburgh. She was a member of Vassar College's class of 1891. Rickert's name and achievements are inextricably linked with those of John M. Manly (1865‚Äì1940). Close colleagues and collaborators for some 40 years at the University of Chicago, they worked jointly on the Chaucer Life-Records and the Text of the Canterbury Tales, which took sixteen years to complete, the first volume of which Rickert did not live to see published. Manly, president of the Modern Language Association of America (1920) and later of the Medieval Academy of America (1929‚Äì30), was posthumously recognized by being awarded such honors as the Haskins Medal for his work on the Chaucer manuscripts. Rickert, however, was eclipsed by Manly's shadow and is only now beginning to receive her the recognition she deserves.William Snell, \\"A Woman Medievalist Much Maligned: A Note in Defense of Edith Rickert (1871‚Äì1938),\\" in: Eminent Chaucerians? Early Women Scholars and the History of Reading Chaucer, ed. Richard Utz and Peter Schneck, Philologie im Netz (Supplement 4, 2009), pp. 41-54. From the information that is widely known about her, Rickert's literary work is organized into six categories: Books; Short Stories; Poems; Essays, Memoirs, and Reviews; Articles; and Translations and Works by Others. In her years traveling and studying Medieval literature in England, she constantly wrote and rewrote/made notes on these pieces. When she returned to the United States she worked as a writer in Boston for a few years, and moved to Washington D.C. to work as a cryptographer for the government during World War I. The details of this period in her life are fuzzy at first glance, but she did meet Manly at this position. From there they developed a close relationship and moved to the University of Chicago where they continued to work for over a decade on two main literary projects, as mentioned before. For years, Rickert‚Äôs work as a cryptographer was ignored, and her work at the University of Chicago was only acknowledged because she worked with Manly. There are also many assumptions about her relationship with Manly, as they were both never married, and worked together in close proximity for a lengthy period of time. Research on Rickert shows that she surprisingly and interestingly links military intelligence, modern textual analysis, and codebreaking, while managing to be a woman of elusive secrets. Rickert says in her book, ‚ÄúNew Methods for the Study of Literature‚Äù, that she developed these methods from her years of experience in modernist literature, more specifically her role as a codebreaker for military intelligence. This links Rickert back to the American Black Chamber, where she was a founding member and leader of the MI-8 with Manly, prior to their years of work as Chaucer Scholars at the University of Chicago. In the Black Chamber, Yardley says that cryptographers have a certain way of thinking which makes them successful-- these people were called cipher-brains. He said that amongst the thousands that worked for MI-8, there were only a dozen or so cipher-brains, including Manly and Rickert. They had a certain ability to develop and break code, pre- computer, which very few other individuals possessed at that time. Rickert took those skills of textual analysis into her career at the University of Chicago after MI-8, and that was how she was able to develop successful analyzation methods for her students. Rickert was mainly responsible for the arrest and prosecution of one of the most famous of the German spies of the first world war, Pablo Waberski, with her use of the Zimmerman cipher. The Black Chamber eventually morphed into the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and National Security Alliance (NSA). Rickert then returned to the University of Chicago and used the tools she learned as a Cryptographer to analyze modernist literature, such as the works of Woolf, for the rest of her career until she died in 1938.

The first Elektro-L spacecraft to fly, it became the first Russian geostationary weather satellite to be launched since Elektro No.1 in 1994. Spacecraft Elektro-L No.1 is the first of two Elektro-L satellites to be launched. It was manufactured by Lavochkin, based on the Navigator satellite bus, and had a mass at launch of . Designed to operate for ten years, the satellite is positioned over the Indian Ocean at a longitude of 76 degrees east. The MSU-GS scanner is the primary instrument aboard the spacecraft. It is designed to produce visible light and infrared images of a full disc of the Earth. It can produce an image every half-hour, with the visible light images having a resolution of one kilometre, and the infrared images having a resolution of four kilometres. The satellite also carries GGAK-E, a heliophysics payload designed to study radiation from the Sun. The satellite will also be used to relay data between Russian weather stations, and will also be used to relay signals as part of the Cospas-Sarsat system. It carries seven infrared channels and three visible channels. Launch The launch of Elektro‚ÄìL No.1 took place at 12:29 UTC on 20 January 2011. The Zenit-3F carrier rocket, used to place the satellite into orbit, was making its maiden flight. The rocket consisted of a two-stage Zenit-2SB manufactured by the Ukrainian Yuzhnoye Design Bureau, and an NPO Lavochkin-manufactured Fregat-SB upper stage. The launch was also the maiden flight of the Fregat-SB, which was derived from the Fregat, but equipped with additional propellant tanks. The satellite separated from the upper stage at 21:28 UTC. The Russian Federal Space Agency confirmed the spacecraft was operational the next day. Repositioning On July 13, 2016, after the launch of the second Elektro-L satellite, Elektro-L No. 1 began moving from its previous position over the Indian Ocean at 76¬∞ East towards a new location at 14.5¬∞ West over the Atlantic. To achieve this, the spacecraft was put into an orbit 289 kilometers higher than its previous geostationary orbit. This caused the spacecraft to drift West relative to the Earth at a rate of 2.03¬∞ per day. This shift was expected to take 45 days, however on August 24 and August 30, the spacecraft's orbit was lowered to the point where its drift was 0.09¬∞ per day. On September 7 that year, a maneuver brought it to a drift of 0.012¬∞ per day. Finally on October 3, mission control announced that the craft had come to its position of 14.5¬∞ West, and that the transfer had been completed.

He then adopted the modified form of the Greek word Œ±·º∞œÄŒµŒπŒΩœåœÇ (aipeinos) (‚Äúlofty‚Äù), by which he is generally known, and which he claimed was a translation of his real name (Hoeck = hoch). He spent some time in Pomerania, in close relations with the leaders of the Protestant Reformation there. From about 1524 to 1528 he was in Stralsund, in charge of a school. The local authorities asked him to draw up an order of ecclesiastical discipline, which went into effect on 5 November 1525. In October 1529, he succeeded Johann Boldewan as pastor of St. Peter's Church, Hamburg; he helped introduce Bugenhagen's order of discipline in the city. His contest with the cathedral chapter, still Catholic, gave rise to his Pinacidion de Roman√¶ ecclesi√¶ imposturis (1530). On 18 May 1532 he was appointed to the highest office in the Lutheran State Church of the city-state, that of superintendent according to Bugenhagen's order of discipline. In 1534 he visited England at the request of Henry VIII to advise him on his divorce and the Reformation. Aepinus was not able to convince the king to model the English Reformation after the Augsburg Confession, yet he managed to earn the respect of leaders such as Thomas Cromwell. He returned to Hamburg in the following January, and subsequently made numerous journeys as a representative of the city; he took part in all the church movements of the time. He gave weekly theological lectures, usually in Latin, and spent much time on the Psalms. He is best known by the controversy which arose over his teaching on the descent of Christ into Hell. In 1542, finding that the article of the creed on this subject was frequently explained as meaning no more than the going down into the grave, in his lecture on Psalm 16, he put forward the view, already given in Luther‚Äôs explanation of the Psalms, that Christ had really gone down into Hell, to deliver men from its power. Johannes Garcaeus the elder, his successor at St. Peter's, called him to account for this teaching, but left Hamburg in the following year and did not return until 1546. Meantime Aepinus's commentary on Psalm 16 had been published by his assistant Johann Freder, so that his view was widely known. The controversy became serious after Garcaeus' return, and both sides sought to gain support from Wittenberg. Melanchthon could only say that there was no agreement among the doctors on this point. Aepinus' opponents in Hamburg were so turbulent that their leaders were deprived of their offices and banished from the city in 1551. He died in Hamburg on 13 May 1553. His ordinances for the Lutheran Hamburg state church seem to have remained in force until 1603.

It operated a network of services from Anchorage as part of Alaska Airlines Partnerships. Its main base was Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport. Era Aviation has since been renamed Corvus Airlines who currently do business as Ravn Alaska. The company slogan was FlySmart. FlyEra. History Era Aviation was established and initiated operations in 1948 when Carl Brady flew the first commercial helicopter to Alaska for contract work supporting a mapping project for the U.S. government. Fixed-wing aircraft were then acquired by the company in addition to helicopters with rotorcraft being operated in Alaska, California and Louisiana by the Era Helicopters division. Scheduled fixed-wing passenger services began in May 1983. During the summer of 1984, Era was operating scheduled services between Anchorage and Bethel, Kenai and Valdez. Era was a wholly owned division of the Rowan Companies. The airline formerly operated Convair 580 turboprops as well as de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter and DHC-7 Dash 7 aircraft and then added DHC-8 Dash 8 turboprops. Most of the airline's scheduled passenger flights were code share feeder services for Alaska Airlines. Era used the two-letter \\"AS\\" airline code for its flight numbers on these services for Alaska Airlines. Beechcraft 1900C and Beechcraft 1900D turboprops were subsequently added to the fleet. Effective February 27, 2009, Era Aviation, Inc. was bought out and became a subsidiary of The Frontier Alaska Group along with Frontier Flying Service and Hageland Aviation. The combination of the three air carriers resulted in the largest Alaska-based airline in terms of serving more destinations and passengers operated with the largest airplane fleet in the state. The three airlines then operated under the marketing name of Era Alaska/Frontier Alaska (Hagland Aviation and Frontier Flying Services) which has since changed the marketing name of all the airlines to Ravn Alaska/Ravn Connect brands. Destinations Era Aviation De Havilland Canada DHC-8-103 Era Aviation operated scheduled passenger services to the following destinations in Alaska and Canada at various times over the years prior to the merger which created Era Alaska.http://www.timetableimages.com, Era Aviation system timetables and route maps Most flights were operated from its hub located at the Ted Stevens International Airport (ANC) in Anchorage: * Aniak, Alaska * Barrow, Alaska (via an intermediate stop in Fairbanks) * Bethel, Alaska * Cordova, Alaska * Deadhorse, Alaska (Prudhoe Bay, Alaska) * Fairbanks, Alaska * Galena, Alaska * Homer, Alaska * Iliamna, Alaska * Kenai, Alaska * Kodiak, Alaska * St. Mary's, Alaska * Unalakleet, Alaska * Valdez, Alaska * Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada - only international route flown by Era In addition, Ravn Alaska offers scheduled service to more than 100 communities statewide. Fleet The Corvus fleet includes the following aircraft (upon merger): * 3 Beechcraft 1900D * 10 Bombardier Dash 8 Q100 Era Aviation previously operated Convair 580 turboprop aircraft as well as de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter and DHC-7 Dash 7 turboprop aircraft. The Twin Otter and Dash 7 are short takeoff and landing (STOL) aircraft. The company also operated a Lear 35 business jet; however, this aircraft was not used in scheduled passenger airline operations. A flight seeing air tour service with Douglas DC-3 aircraft was also operated from Anchorage as Era Classic Airlines. Bankruptcy and buyout After being bought and sold several times over the years, Era filed for bankruptcy in 2005. In 2009 the company was acquired by rival Frontier Alaska Group and the Frontier Flying Service Part 121 mainline operation was in the process of being merged into Era Aviation's certificate. In 2010, Era Alaska was formed using the assets of Frontier Alaska Group, Frontier Flying Service, Era Aviation, and Hageland Aviation.

History A one-off edition of Family Catchphrase was made by TVS in 1992 & broadcast on ITV on 1 January 1994, hosted by regular Catchphrase presenter Roy Walker, in which teams of family would play Catchphrase. In early 1994, The Family Channel (now Challenge) produced a spin-off series of Family Catchphrase, hosted by Andrew O'Connor. The game was played by teams of two related players (normally parent and child) and featured slightly different rules to the normal game. The teams played for points rather than pounds and the second round would feature the players taking alternative turns, rather than answering the phrases as a team. As The Family Channel was an early satellite and cable channel, prizes were not as expensive due to a smaller budget although the M Square prize wasn't revealed unless it had actually been won. However, it wasn't uncommon to see prizes such as a Sega Master System games console or a day-trip to Thorpe Park given away as prizes. The graphics and music were taken from the normal version of the show. Main game The main gameplay was the same as the normal Catchphrase, but each player played for points instead of money. =Round One= The team that won the coin toss before the show would select the point value of the catchphrases in that round (10 to 50). The computer would draw a catchphrase, a bell would ring and the team that guessed correctly would win the points. =Bonus Catchphrase= The team that guessed the catchphrase correctly would get a chance at solving the Bonus Catchphrase. The catchphrase value doubled each round (50, 100, 200 etc.). The point drop also increased in value by five each round (5, 10, 15 and so on). =Solo Shoot= The teams played as a one-on-one battle, with first the children playing and then the adults. Beforehand, one of the teams decided the point value (60 to 100). The rest of the rules were the same for that round. =Fast and Furious= Based on Roy Walker's Ready Money Round, O'Connor's version was renamed \\"Fast and Furious\\" because there was no money involved. Unlike Walker's round, the randomiser could select any amount on the screen from 110 to 150 points. There was no bell for this round. Super Catchphrase The final round was the same as Walker's series except the M square's prize was \\"a mystery prize\\" according to O'Connor. Famous guests One episode of Family Catchphrase featured a guest appearance from Steven Radosh, creator of Catchphrase. Another episode featured an appearance by the then unknown comedian Simon Amstell and his aunt as contestants. Amstell was only about 14 years old at the time.Simon Amstell on Family Catchphrase, Part 1 on YouTube.Simon Amstell on Family Catchphrase, Part 2 on YouTube.Simon Amstell on Family Catchphrase, Part 3 on YouTube.

He also played cricket at first-class level, and was awarded Blues for both sports by the University of Oxford for appearing against Cambridge. But in 1952, at the age of twenty-four, he gave up playing both games, in order to devote his life to working for the Moral Re-Armament (MRA) movement.Obituary from Daily Telegraph on 22 Jan 2011 Retrieved 22 January 2011 Early life The son of a doctor, Boobbyer attended Durston House preparatory school before transferring to Uppingham, a leading \\"public school\\". Whilst there he became Head Boy. After school, he did his National Service, during which time he first played rugby at senior club level, for Rosslyn Park. In 1948 he went up to the University of Oxford to read History at Brasenose College, already with a reputation as a good cricketer and rugby player. Rugby career As well as playing club rugby for Rosslyn Park, Boobbyer played for Middlesex in the County Championship. He also appeared for the Barbarians.Career statistics from CricketArchive Retrieved 22 January 2011. He first played for Oxford in his second year, going on to appear in three matches against Cambridge, thus achieving the distinction of becoming a \\"double Blue\\". All three matches were won. A centre, he made his international debut for England, against Wales, on 21 January 1950. He won nine caps during this and the following two seasons, all in the Five Nations Championship, scoring two tries.Rugby Union profile Retrieved 22 January 2011 He performed particularly well on an England tour of South Africa in 1951. In 1952 he was the only scorer in a 3-0 victory against Ireland.

He made his first appearance in the annual University Match against Cambridge in his first season of 1949, and thus was awarded his Blue. He scored what proved to be a match-winning 80 in the 1951 match. The Daily Telegraph, in its obituary, described him as \\"a doughty rather than a spectacular cricketer\\" (though adding that this could not be said of his rugby). Middlesex were interested in signing him as an opening batsman had he not given up the game. Work for Moral Re-Armament Boobbyer joined the MRA movement whilst at Oxford. After finishing at university, he went on a rugby tour to Japan, but at the end of the tour he stayed on to work with an international MRA group which had the aim of promoting reconciliation following World War II. He devoted the rest of his life to his MRA work, and never subsequently played sport at a serious level. He later travelled for the movement to the Philippines, the USA and India, amongst many other places. He was a fine public speaker, able to put across spiritual themes in an understandable and sympathetic way. Family Boobbyer married Juliet Rodd (who survived him), a daughter of Francis Rodd, 2nd Baron Rennell, in 1957; they had two sons. The couple lived and worked in Oxford for many years.

Craon was besieged by the army of Henry of Navarre, but the defenders, supported by a Catholic relief force recruited by Philippe Emmanuel, Duke of Merc≈ìur, resisted. At the end, Craon was relieved by the Spaniards under Don Juan del √Åguila, who defeated the Anglo-French besiegers. Background The commander of the Catholic League of France in the region, the Duke of Merc≈ìur, Governor of Brittany, ordered his chief lieutenant, Urbain de Laval Boisdauphin, to strengthen Craon. In 1590, Merc≈ìur rebelled against the accession to the throne of France of Henry of Navarre and became the head of the Catholic League of Brittany, aiming to restore the autonomy of the former Duchy, and proclaimed protector of the Catholic Church in the region of Brittany. The Duke of Merc≈ìur had the support of the Catholic King, Philip II of Spain, who sent him 7,000 Spanish soldiers who landed at Blavet (Port Louis) under the command of Don Juan del √Åguila. On 8 February 1592, Henry of Navarre decided to take the city of Craon. His cousins, the Duke of Montpensier and Fran√ßois de Bourbon, Prince de Conti, secretly gathered together in Laval to organise the attack. Montpensier arrived with his army on 14 April 1592 and laid siege to the town. He was aided by 1,200 English led by Anthony Wingfield (in John Norreys' absence)MacCaffrey p.155 and 800 German mercenaries. Then on 20 May 1592, Merc≈ìur and Sabl√© arrived with their armies to defend Craon. Battle of Craon The defense of the city of Craon by the Catholic troops against the French troops of Montpensier and Conti was heroic. On 22 May 1592 the Spanish-Catholic army reached Craon under Don Juan del √Åguila and the Duke of Merc≈ìur. The Spanish-Catholic troops charged against the left flank, taking by surprise the Anglo-French besiegers. At the same time the besieged angrily attacked the right flank, finally achieving a brilliant victory. Under cover of night, Montpensier retired to Laval and Rennes. The Spaniards captured all the artillery, ammunition carts, flags, equipment, and supplies from the enemy. The English soldiers captured were not given quarter, and were all executed, in part in retaliation for the cruelty received from the English on the wrecks of the Spanish Armada. Aftermath Fran√ßois de Bourbon, Prince of Conti, commander of the French Royal army. Urbain de Laval Boisdauphin, Marquis de Sabl√©, commander of the Catholic League. J√©r√¥me d'Arradon, a French commander, who was entrusted with the command of Hennebont and Blavet by Merc≈ìur, quickly realized that the Spaniards behaved as their conquerors and did not recognize any authority other than their King, Philip of Spain. Just a few days later, Laval fell in the hands of the Catholic League. On 23 May 1592 the Prince of Conti retreated into the Chateau-Gontier. The Duke Merc≈ìur and the Marquis of Sabl√© entered into Laval and took the Chateau-Gontier. Boisdauphin took command of Laval, and Louis Champagn√© became Governor of Chateau-Gontier.

Studio in a School  Agnes Gund is the founder and board chair of Studio in a School. Now in its fifth decade, Studio in a School has provided visual art instruction led by professional artists to nearly one million students through its New York City School Programs. Since its founding in 1977, Studio has partnered with over 800 schools and community-based organizations throughout the five boroughs of New York City. Every year, more than 100 professional artists devote some 45,000 hours to over 30,000 pre-k through high school students, often in schools that would otherwise lack visual arts instruction. About 90 percent of all children who participate in Studio programs come from low-income families. Studio's New York City School Programs include the multi-year, full-time Long Term Program, an Early Childhood Program, and more flexible Residency Programs. In 2016, Studio in a School launched the Studio Institute under the leadership of long-time Studio President Thomas Cahill.

It was a single-engined, single-seat parasol winged monoplane, but was unsuccessful, being quickly abandoned. Design and development In 1921, B. Douglas Thomas, chief designer of Thomas-Morse Aircraft designed two closely related parasol monoplanes, a single-seat fighter, the MB-9 and a two- seat trainer, the MB-10. They were of all-metal construction, with corrugated duralumin skinning.Wegg 1990, p. 27. First to be completed was the MB-10, which had tandem cockpits and was designed to be powered by a Wright or Lawrance radial engine. In the absence of the intended engine, it was fitted with a Le Rh√¥ne 9Ja rotary engine to allow flight testing to start in late 1921. The MB-10's handling proved to be extremely poor, while it also suffered severe vibration and was structurally weak.Angelucci and Bowers 1987, p. 423. The MB-9 fighter was completed early in 1922, differing principally from the MB-10 in the removal of the forward cockpit and the use of a Wright Hispano H-3 V8 engine, cooled by a radiator situated (along with the oil tank) in a torpedo-shaped structure under the fuselage. Planned armament was two machine guns; one and one . While the MB.9 handled better than the MB.10, it still suffered from the severe vibration and structural problems that plagued the trainer, together with a weak undercarriage and cooling problems. The development of both aircraft was quickly stopped, with the types not being sent for formal evaluation by the United States Army Air Service at McCook Field.

The building is located on the Torenstraat, named for its high tower. Together with the Binnenhof, it is one of the oldest buildings in The Hague. Members of the House of Orange-Nassau have been baptised and married there. The latest are Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands and his daughter Catharina-Amalia, Princess of Orange. History Stained glass window to commemorate the martyr Jan de Bakker, designed by Max Nauta, executed by glaziers 'Schrier en De Ru' in Haarlem, 1930 The Great, or St. James' Church, was founded in the late 13th century, probably as a wooden church. The present church was built in stages, between the 14th and 16th century. First in the year 1337 sources speak of the ‚Äúgreat church‚Äù (Dutch: grote kercke), which is a typical historical indication of a brick structure. It has a fine vaulted interior, and contains some old stained glass, a carved wooden pulpit (1550), a large organ and interesting sepulchral monuments, and 34 escutcheons of the knights of the Order of the Golden Fleece, placed here after the chapter of 1456. During excavations in 2009 archeologists determined that some basement walls were built with bricks which they could date between the year 1320 and 1350. Documents from the year 1399, referring to maintenance work on the church, show that by then the church was a brick construction. The stone church was originally built as a cruciform church. In the facade adjacent to the tower, there are still traces of the roof line of 1424. They show a nave with two lower aisles. Between 1434 and 1455, both lower aisles were broadened and raised to the roof level of the nave, consequently losing the cross shape. This expansion made the St. James Church of The Hague the first example in the Low Countries of the so-called ‚ÄúHague Hall church‚Äù, a type of hall church. From that time onwards, this type of church would be applied on a larger scale, especially in the County of Holland. The church is remarkable for its fine tower and chime of bells, and contains the cenotaph monument of Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam, designed by Cornelis Moninckx and sculpted by Bartholomeus Eggers in 1667, and the renaissance tomb of Gerrit van Assendelft (1487 - 1558). Also notable is the late Baroque tomb of Philip, Landgrave of Hesse-Philippsthal and his wive Catherine of Solms-Laubach, designed by Daniel Marot in 1721. The church's six-sided tower was finished between 1420 and 1424. The tower, tall, is one of the tallest in the Netherlands. There are 34 panels with shields and names of knights of the golden fleece.Rijksmonument report The richly carved wooden pulpit was made in 1550. The mechanical clock has 15 bells by M. de Haze in 1686, one by Jasper and Jan Moer from 1541, one from H. Van Trier from 1570, one by Coenraat Wegewaert from 1647, and one from C. Fremy from 1692 and 31 modern bells. In the church tower there is an automatic carillon by Libertus van den Burgh, from 1689. In the tower the mechanical clock was installed in 1927. The clock with drum by Heynrick Vabrie that was used from 1541 to 1689 is kept in the museum 'Speelklok' in Utrecht. The church endured a fire in 1539, and the stained glass windows were repaired by leading glass artists, including the brothers Dirk and Wouter Crabeth of Gouda.website \\"Stichting Grote Kerk Den Haag\\" - Bezienswaardigheden Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, who visited the church after the fire, sponsored two windows by the Crabeth's that due to their royal origin are the only two windows that have survived up to the present day. Under one of these windows lies a commemorative stone from 1857 for Constantijn and Christiaan Huygens, who were buried in unmarked graves in the choir of the church. Some notable people buried in the church are Count John Albert I of Solms-Braunfels, a cousin of William the Silent, who died in exile (buried in 1623), Rombout Hogerbeets, Dutch statesman (1625), Anthonie Duyck (in 1629), Grand Pensionary of Holland, Louis of Nassau, Lord of De Lek and Beverweerd, an illegitimate son of Maurice, Prince of Orange (in 1665), Gaspar Fagel (1668), Grand Pensionary of Holland, Lieuwe van Aitzema, a famous spy for England during the First and Second Anglo-Dutch War (buried in 1669), field marshal Ren√© de Cordeux, Marquess of Langey, a grandson of Louise de Coligny (1712), Daniel Marot, architect (1752), Countess Anna Isabella of Nassau-LaLecq (1765), Count Unico Wilhelm van Wassenaer, diplomat and composer (1766), and Hieronymus van Alphen, poet (1803).

The Old Road came over what is now the Tejon Pass from what would become Gorman then turned west up Cuddy Creek to Cuddy Valley its spring. Afterward the road descended to the north, through the San Emigdio Mountains, via San Emigdio Canyon along San Emigdio Creek to the San Joaquin Valley.

He joined the U. S. Army and after being discharged in 1853, followed his former unit, the 1st Dragoon Regiment, to Fort Tejon in 1854 as a civilian teamster. He became the herdsman for the fort and found meadow in a valley some miles west of the fort that was ideal for grazing its stock. Cuddy eventually built a log cabin west of the fort in the small valley just southwest of modern Lake of the Woods, and laid claim to land in what became known at the time as Cuddy's Valley, (later Little Cuddy Valley), and raised cattle there. John Cuddy married Margaret Gale in 1858 and by 1861 had moved his family into a larger log cabin that still stands, west of the present community of Lake of the Woods.

His death was officially acknowledged on 11 November simultaneously by Soviet radio and television. After five days of national mourning, Brezhnev was given a state funeral and then buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis. Yuri Andropov, Brezhnev's eventual successor as general secretary, was chairman of the committee in charge of managing Brezhnev's funeral, held on 15 November 1982, five days after his death. The funeral was attended by 32 heads of state, 15 heads of government, 14 foreign ministers and four princes; U.S. President Ronald Reagan sent George H. W. Bush, the Vice President of the United States. Eulogies were delivered by Yuri Andropov, Dmitriy Ustinov, Anatoly Alexandrov, and a factory worker. Death and declaration Brezhnev and Dmitry Ustinov at the 1979 October Revolution Day Parade on Red Square celebrating the 62nd anniversary of the revolution. Brezhnev had struggled with several ailments since 1974, most notably heart disease, leukemia, jaw cancer, emphysema and circulatory disease, all of which had been exacerbated by his heavy smoking and obesity. There had been rumours of Brezhnev's death ever since the mid-1970s; he had been absent from important meetings demanded by protocol and it was rumoured that his health was in decline. Brezhnev had rarely appeared in public for most of 1982 and was usually surrounded by doctors, although the Soviet Government insisted that he was not ill. He suffered a severe stroke in May 1982, but refused to relinquish office until he died on 10 November 1982 after suffering a heart attack. He was honored with a state funeral in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis on the Red Square after a five-day period of nationwide mourning. The first hint of his death to the Soviet people came at 7:15 p.m. Moscow Time, when the usual television programs were altered and a pop music concert was replaced by a documentary on Vladimir Lenin. On Vremya, the Soviet Union's state television newscast, the hosts wore somber clothes instead of their normally informal dress code. At first, Soviet citizens believed it was Andrei Kirilenko who had died, as he had not been present at the 65th anniversary of the October Revolution a few days earlier (he died in 1990). Furthermore, other abrupt changes to the television line-up occurred, such as the appearance of an unscheduled program of war reminiscences and the replacement of an ice hockey game on Channel Two with Tchaikovsky's Path√©tique symphony. Brezhnev's death was announced on 11 November simultaneously by Soviet radio and television hosts. The television announcement was read by Igor Kirillov with tears in his eyes at 11 a.m. Moscow Time. Western commentators had already speculated that Brezhnev had died when he failed to sign a message of congratulations to Jos√© Eduardo dos Santos, the President of Angola, for the Angolan Independence Day. This was a breach of protocol, and, as Brezhnev had earlier signed messages to all Soviet-aligned heads of state, the absence of his signature was seen as suspicious. The delay in declaring the death of Brezhnev was seen as proof of the ongoing power struggle in the Soviet leadership over who would succeed him. Konstantin Chernenko was seen as the most likely candidate to succeed Brezhnev. Funeral service On 11 November Yuri Andropov was elected chairman of the committee in charge of managing Brezhnev's funeral. This election marked the beginning of Brezhnev's funeral. The occasion was seen as a sign by First World commentators that Andropov was the most likely candidate for the position of general secretary. During the funerals of Soviet leaders there was a custom of displaying their decorations on velvet cushions, which were carried in the procession behind the coffin. This task was traditionally given to an escort of senior officers, each carrying a cushion with one decoration on it. However, as Brezhnev had more than two hundred decorations, several were placed on each cushion. Brezhnev's funeral officer escort ultimately included forty-four persons. Galina Brezhneva, Brezhnev's disgraced daughter, was constantly followed by two burly guards. Andropov, Brezhnev's successor as general secretary, embraced Viktoria Brezhneva but allegedly turned his back to Galina. This claim has been disputed, with a Time article dating back to 1982 claiming that Andropov embraced both, and not just Viktoria. Even so, during Andropov's fifteen-month rule, Galina stopped appearing in public. At the funeral, Andropov praised Brezhnev for his \\"struggle for the relaxation of international tensions and for delivering mankind from the threat of nuclear war\\" and his d√©tente policy. Andrei Kirilenko, a leading Politburo member, burst into tears when confronting Viktoria at the funeral. The Moscow militsiya sealed off downtown Moscow during the funeral on 15 November. Large avenues were tightly guarded by the police and the Moscow military garrison. The soldiers, who stood in front of the House of the Unions, wore black-edged red armbands. The House of the Unions was decorated by numerous red flags and other communist symbols. Brezhnev's body lay in state for three days at the House of the Unions. On the third day the coffin was placed on an artillery carriage towed by an olive-green BRDM-2 armored vehicle of the Red Army‚Äîled by dozens of wreaths as well as Brezhnev's decorations carried by Soviet military personnel and other mourners‚Äîto the Lenin Mausoleum on the Red Square, where it was greeted by speeches by Andropov; Minister of Defence Dmitriy Ustinov; Anatoly Alexandrov, the President of the Academy of Sciences; and a factory worker. After the speeches, pallbearers, led by Andropov and Nikolai Tikhonov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers, carried the coffin to another location close to the mausoleum. It was here that Brezhnev's family made their farewell. Before the body was laid to rest Viktoria kissed Brezhnev on the face in accordance with Russian traditions. As Brezhnev's body was lowered into the grave a military squad saluted while an orchestra played the Soviet national anthem. According to Time magazine, Brezhnev's death was mourned by the majority of Soviets. Brezhnev's body reportedly sustained two falls. As the coffin was lifted into place for the lying in state at the Column Hall of the House of the Unions, Brezhnev's body fell through the bottom. After that, a new, metal-plated coffin was made, and as it was lowered into the grave, the funeral servants could not handle its weight and the coffin fell with a loud crash into the grave hole. This account, however, was contested by Georgy Kovalenko, one of the funeral servants‚Äîaccording to him, twenty minutes before the deposition of the coffin he was asked by the Kremlin custodian Semyon Shornikov to lower the coffin simultaneously with the chime of bells. Foreign dignitaries The funeral was attended by 32 heads of state, 15 heads of government, 14 foreign ministers, 4 princes and the UN Secretary General. Among the foreign dignitaries to attend the funeral were: * President Babrak Karmal of Afghanistan * President Rudolf Kirchschl√§ger of Austria * Prime Minister of Belgium Wilfried Martens * Chairman of the State Council of Bulgaria Todor Zhivkov * President and General Secretary Heng Samrin of Kampuchea * Prime Minister of Canada Pierre Trudeau and his son and future Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. * Foreign Minister Huang Hua of China * President Fidel Castro of Cuba * President of the Socialist Republic of Czechoslovakia Gust√°v Hus√°k and First Secretary of the Communist Party Milo≈° Jake≈° * Henrik, Prince Consort of Denmark * Chairman Mengistu Haile Mariam of Ethiopia * Prime Minister Pierre Mauroy of France * State Chairman and General Secretary Erich Honecker of East Germany * President Karl Carstens of West Germany * Prime Minister of Greece Andreas Papandreou * General Secretary of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party J√°nos K√°d√°r * Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India * President Sandro Pertini of Italy * Prime Minister Zenk≈ç Suzuki of Japan * President Moussa Traor√© of Mali * General Secretary of the Mongolian People's Party Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal and Chairman of the Council of Ministers Jambyn Batm√∂nkh * Vice President Alex Ifeanyichukwu Ekwueme of Nigeria * Vice President Pak Song-chol of North Korea * Chairman Yasser Arafat of the Palestine Liberation Organization * First Secretary and Prime Minister Wojciech Jaruzelski of Poland * President Nicolae Ceau»ôescu of Romania * President Hafez al-Assad of Syria * British Foreign Minister Francis Pym * Vice President of the United States George H.

Ronald Reagan, the President of the United States, did not attend but sent a delegation headed by Vice President George H. W. Bush. Secretary of State George Shultz, Central Intelligence Agency Director William Casey and National Security Advisor William P. Clark tried to persuade Reagan to attend the funeral. Reagan rejected the idea; furthermore, he stated that he had no intention to alter US policy towards the Soviet Union because of Brezhnev's death. Condolences Among notable condolences was one from Ronald Reagan, the President of the United States, who woke up at 3:35 a.m. to write a two- paragraph message about Brezhnev. Reagan called Brezhnev \\"one of the world's most important figures for nearly two decades\\" and expressed hopes for the improvement of Soviet‚ÄìUS relations. Pope John Paul II promised \\"a particular thought for the memory of the illustrious departed one\\", while former West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt said Brezhnev's death would \\"be painfully felt\\". The government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) expressed \\"deep condolences\\" and Indira Gandhi, the Prime Minister of India, said \\"he [Brezhnev] stood by us in our moment of need\\".

The book follows the story of journalist Charlie Johnson who, while covering ethnic violence in the Balkans, witnesses a woman purposely set on fire by a Serbian officer. The event haunts Charlie Johnson who tracks down the officer in an attempt to discover how he could rationalize such an action. Since its publication in October 2003, it has been analysed in several literature journals. It was met with reviews that found the book to be a satisfying thriller but with uneven pacing. Background At the time of publication, author Michael Ignatieff was 56 years old and the director of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy at Harvard University. He had previously written numerous non-fiction books, including Empire Lite: Nation-Building in Bosnia, Kosovo and Afghanistan and The Lesser Evil - Political Ethics in an Age of Terror (for the Gifford Lectures) which were both published in 2003 along with Charlie Johnson in the Flames. Ignatieff had written two previous novels, Asya in 1991 and Scar Tissue in 1993, which was short-listed for the Man Booker Prize. Synopsis American reporter Charlie Johnson and his Polish cameraman Jacek investigate violence taking place in Kosovo. While in Serb-occupied territory, where there has been significant guerilla fighting, they hide in a house belonging to a Muslim family. They witness a Serb patrol unit destroy a house and light a fleeing woman on fire. A horrified Charlie attempts to assist the woman but she dies at an American field hospital. The event haunts Charlie, even after he returns to his family in England. In an attempt to understand how someone could justify such actions, Charlie tracks down the officer responsible to ask him why he did what he did. Style and themes The book uses parallels and symbols to portray Charlie as a martyr who sacrifices in order to be in a position to communicate to the world the events that are occurring in war zones. Bronwyn Drainie links the fire imagery to \\"iconographic figures like St. Peter in Chains, the Madonna in Glory, or Susanna Among the Elders\\". Drainie also notes that \\"the novel is full of the vocabulary of purification and redemption\\". An article in the journal English Studies compared the characterizations of war correspondents in Ignatieff's Charlie Johnson in the Flames and Pat Barker's Double Vision, both of whom report on violence to \\"image-dominated cultures\\" and deal with debates regarding intervention. Likewise, an article in the New York Times Book Review compared fictional portrayals war correspondents in Alan Cowell's A Walking Guide and Gil Courtemanche's A Sunday at the Pool in Kigali with Ignatieff's Charlie Johnson. While Ignatieff does address the debate on intervention on foreign affairs, and its moral implication, he was quoted as saying that he was not trying to make a point, \\"In fiction, there is no message. The book is about Charlie and what happens to him. It's driven by the plot, not by any ideas that I might have.\\" Publication and reception In the Library Journal review, HM comments that it has the \\"rapid-fire pacing of a modern thriller and the escalating emotions of Graham Greene's best\\" and writes, \\"Readers will be hooked from the get-go and wish that Charlie's odyssey weren't quite so short. A fine complement to the author's nonfiction works‚Äîand a shoo-in for book groups‚Äîthis is highly recommended for all collections.\\" The review in The Economist commented on the books uneven pace, concluding, \\"The fine writing and potential for interesting development that the novel's early sections promise burn out all too quickly.\\" The Entertainment Weekly reviewer gave it an \\"A Minus\\" and wrote that \\"Ignatieff never rushes, making his deliberate, philosophical way from the adrenaline-surged first chapter to the chilling, poignant conclusion\\". In Kirkus Reviews, the book was said to exhibit a \\"bold, slashing view of the tiresome banality of evil\\" but criticized the use of \\"clich√©d characters\\". Critic Donna Seaman wrote, in Booklist, that the story was \\"surgically honed, emotionally scorching, and powerfully resonant tale\\". In Publishers Weekly, the review said, \\"This is a readable but standard tale of redemption and revenge, one that would have benefited from the layers of psychological and political insight that Ignatieff brings to the rest of his work.\\" In Quill & Quire, Bronwyn Drainie wrote that, despite some flaws, \\"the book is a gripping short read, largely due to Ignatieff's sharp eye for detail and his sinewy, journalistic prose. Novels don't necessarily have to be completely convincing to be entertaining\\".

Biography He graduated from Harvard in 1840, and got a medical degree there in 1843. At Harvard, he received the Boylston Prize for his thesis on ‚ÄúContagiousness of Puerperal Fever,‚Äù and again, in 1844, for his essay on ‚ÄúHydrotherapy.‚Äù Subsequently he spent two years in professional studies in Paris, and then began the practice of his profession in Boston, meanwhile serving as demonstrator of anatomy in Harvard Medical School 1845-1847, and serving as physician to the Boston Dispensary. He then passed some time in Brazil, and also visited the Lake Superior copper region. During the Civil War, he entered the army as acting assistant surgeon from Massachusetts, and was assigned to duty with General Ambrose Burnside. He accompanied the expedition to New Bern, North Carolina, in March 1862, and after its capture was assigned to duty at the Craven Street Hospital there, and at the hospital in Beaufort, North Carolina. In October 1862, he was commissioned surgeon of the 45th Massachusetts Regiment, and served in that capacity in New Berne until the regiment was discharged in July 1863. He then entered the corps of surgeons of volunteers, and was placed in charge, successively, of the university hospital in New Orleans, and of the marine hospital in Mobile. In 1866, he was mustered out of the service with the brevet rank of lieutenant colonel. He returned to Boston, and became associated in the work of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he held the office of instructor 1867-1869, and then professor of zoology and physiology 1869-1878, also acting as secretary of the corporation in 1866-1878, and as secretary of the faculty 1871-1878. In 1878, Kneeland returned to literary work and lecturing, in Boston and later the Philippine Islands. He traveled extensively in search of information concerning earthquakes and volcanic phenomena, making visits to the Hawaiian Islands and to Iceland in 1874, at the time of its millennial celebration, for this purpose. He was a member of numerous scientific societies, and held the office of secretary to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and to the Boston Society of Natural History. Polygenism Charles Hamilton Smith published The Natural History of the Human Species in 1848. In this book he maintained that there had always been three fundamentally distinct human types: the Caucasian, the Mongolian and the Negro. Smith was a monogenist but with qualifications,Damon Ieremia Salesa, Racial Crossings: Race, intermarriage, and the Victorian British Empire (2011), pp. 148‚Äì9; Google Books. and he referred to the polygenist theory of Samuel George Morton.Gustav Jahoda, Crossroads Between Culture and Mind: Continuities and Change in Theories of Human Nature, 1993, p. 93 When Smith's book was re-printed in America, Kneeland wrote an 84-page introduction to it. There Kneeland laid out evidence which he maintained supported polygenist creationism; and argued that the Bible is compatible with multiple Adams.David N. Livingstone, Adam's Ancestors: race, religion, and the politics of human origins (2008), pp. 97-99 Publications In addition to editing The Annual of Scientific Discovery (1886‚Äì89), a translation of Andry's Diseases of the Heart (1847), and Smith's History of the Human Species, he wrote Science and Mechanism (1854), The Wonders of the Yosemite Valley, and of California (1871), An American in Iceland (1876), and Volcanoes and Earthquakes (1888). He contributed largely to medical literature, and was the author of many articles, mostly on zoological and medical subjects, in The American Cyclop√¶dia. =Selected titles= * The Wonders of the Yosemite Valley, and of California (1871) * An American in Iceland (1876) * The Philippine Islands (1883) * Volcanoes and Earthquakes (1888) Notes References External links * Samuel Kneeland, Wonders of Yosemite Valley (1872) Category:1821 births Category:1888 deaths Category:American naturalists Category:People from Boston Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty Category:Harvard College alumni Category:Harvard Medical School alumni ","title":"Samuel Kneeland (naturalist)"},{"id":"30583115","text":"Virginia Anne Gilder (born June 4, 1958), also known as Ginny Gilder, is an American former competitive rower and Olympic silver medalist.

It has a population of around 10,000. Geography US military engineers survey a planned bridge in Tojg, Lash wa Juwayn district The village is located north by road from Lash-e Joveyn and Lake Puzak and south of Farah. The Farah River is the major river flowing to the east of the village. Economy The people of Tojg are mainly dependent upon agriculture; many fields exist around the village. One problem, however, was that for many years the Farah River would be prone to seasonal flooding, which prevents local farmers from accessing the main road and their farmlands, restricting transportation of their goods to market. In order to address this, the US-led Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) constructed the Tojg Bridge across the Farah River near the village, a project costing $1.7 million, financed by the Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP). The construction of the 300-meter-long, 12-meter-high bridge took place between 2007 and 2010 and employed several hundred local laborers and contractors. The project was jointly managed by several companies, namely Shir Pir Construction Company, Bradaran Noori, Kheyaban Construction Company, and Meihan Parwar. In December 2009, the bridge was reported to be 80% complete, but construction had been delayed and was ongoing into 2010. The bridge consists of reinforced concrete arches.

In 1908 President James K. Patterson recommended the establishment of a separate Department of Journalism to support the growth of interest in journalism at the college. Three years later, in 1911, the school began offering Library Science Education starting with its first course in \\"Library Training,\\" offered through the English Department. The following year, Margaret I. King, secretary to President Patterson and namesake of the Margaret I. King Library, was appointed as the university's first librarian for the 7,367 gross sq. ft., Carnegie Library.Jester, Art and Holly E.

In 1914 the Department of Journalism was finally established and Enoch Grehan was appointed as the department's first director. The following year, the Kentucky Kernel publishes its first issue. In 1917 Margaret I. King began teaching a new library science course titled \\"Library Methods for Teachers.\\" As the Kentucky Kernel continued its operations, director Grehan took the bold move of risk his savings in order to finance a linotype machine to enable the student newspaper to start its printing operation. By 1931, the Department of Journalism had received its first accreditation and a new Department of Library Science was founded with Mildred Semmons as its head within the following year. The first BS of Library Science became available in 1942 following the Department of Library Science's full accreditation by the American Library Association. In just seven years, the department added a master's degree in Library Science, offering both an undergraduate and graduate degree program. 1950 was a momentous year with the official establishment of the School of Journalism. The University of Kentucky received a gift of $425,000 from the Kentucky Kernel to begin the construction of a new journalism building. By 1966, the MA program in Communication is approved, paving the way for the School of Communications to be established in 1968 with three departments: Journalism, Telecommunications, and Speech. Two years later, the School of Library Science became the College of Library Science, establishing it as the first college of Library Science in the country. On January 19, 1972, the Kentucky Kernel became a completely independent newspaper publication for student reporters, as it continues to remain to this day. Just seven years after its establishment, the School of Communications was abolished and replaced with a School of Journalism and Department of Human Communication. In the following year of 1976, a new College of Communications had been established on the University of Kentucky's campus. Shortly thereafter the College of Communication received approval for its P.h.D. in Communication, enrolling its first class of doctoral students in 1977. In 1980, the University of Kentucky Journalism Alumni Association established the Kentucky Journalism Hall of Fame, located inside the School of Journalism and Media in the Blazer Dining Hall Building In 1993, the College of Communications and College of Library and Information Science merged to create the current College of Communication and Information Studies. In 2000, the Kentucky Kernel was awarded a Pacemaker Award, one of only six daily collegiate newspapers in the country to receive the honor. In 2004, the College of Communication and Information Studies founded the Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues.

Russian troops occupied the airport ahead of a NATO deployment, resulting in a tense stand-off, which was resolved peacefully. Background The Kosovo War ended on 11 June 1999, and a joint NATO-Russian peacekeeping force was to be installed in Kosovo. Russia had expected to receive a peacekeeping sector independent of NATO, and was angered when this was refused. There was concern that a separate Russian sector might lead to a partition of Kosovo between a Serb-controlled north and Albanian south. The Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC) deployed to Skopje in the Republic of Macedonia during early March 1999. The purpose was to provide unified NATO command for several national contingents including a United States battalion which had been in Macedonia for some years, together with newly arrived British, German, French and Italian battalions. The force was known as Kosovo Force (KFOR). The commander of KFOR was British lieutenant general Mike Jackson, with 3-star rank. His superior officer was US Admiral James O. Ellis, NATO commander for southern Europe, based in Naples. Ellis reported to Wesley Clark, the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, although in practice Clark often bypassed Ellis to communicate directly with Jackson. Incident Early on 11 June 1999, a column of about 30 Russian armoured vehicles carrying 250 Russian troops, who were part of the international peacekeeping force in Bosnia, moved into Serbia. At 10:30 a.m. this was confirmed by Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe and by pictures from CNN which showed that the Russians had hastily painted \\"KFOR\\" in white letters on their vehicles where they had previously been \\"SFOR\\". It was assumed that the column was heading for Pristina and Pristina International Airport ahead of the arrival of NATO troops. Upon hearing of the deployment, American NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe General Wesley Clark called NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana, and was told \\"you have transfer of authority\\" in the area. Clark then provisionally ordered a contingent of British and French paratroopers to be flown in by helicopter to seize the airport by force. Staff officers had grave concerns that helicopters might be fired on by Serb forces and that entering Kosovo before the agreed time might cause the Serbs to pull out of the agreement. If the airborne force got into trouble it would have been very difficult to reach them overland through the mountainous country where bridges and tunnels were known to be prepared for demolition. As this operation would have been outside the newly signed agreement for NATO forces to move into Kosovo the following day, national governments had the right to withdraw their own forces and the French government pulled its battalion out. British paras sat by Chinook helicopters in a hot cornfield for most of the afternoon before standing down to prepare for the following day's move into Kosovo. At 5:00 a.m. on 12 June, the British 5th Airborne Brigade began flying into Kosovo from Skopje to secure the ten mile long Kaƒçanik Gorge for the 4th Armoured Brigade to pass through to Pristina. From there, the lead reconnaissance troop in the race to Pristina was commanded by British Captain James Blunt. The first NATO troops to enter Pristina on 12 June 1999 were Norwegian Forsvarets Spesialkommando (FSK) troops and soldiers from the British Special Air Service's 22 SAS, although to NATO's diplomatic embarrassment Russian troops arrived first at the airport. The FSK soldiers were the first to come in contact with the Russian troops at the airport and to report the developments back to General Jackson. Jackson flew by helicopter to Pristina in the evening to hold a press conference, then went to meet General Viktor Zavarzin who commanded the small Russian force. According to other sources there was another Russian individual called \\"Colonel Baranov\\", who was in fact commander of the Spetsnaz unit controlling the airbase and the whole mission. This person (wearing a face mask at all times), also known by his code name(s) Volkodav (rus. ‚ÄúWolves' Shepherd‚Äù) or Kain, was a high-ranking Russian GRU officer observed many times during Russian highest-priority missions around the world, although his real identity remains unknown. Sheltering from heavy rain in the wrecked airport terminal, Jackson shared a flask of whisky with Zavarzin, leading to a warming of relations, though \\"Colonel Baranov\\" categorically refused to participate in conversation. That evening General Clark still seemed obsessed with the possibility of more Russian troops being flown in even though NATO controlled the airspace. Russia had placed several airbases on standby, and prepared battalions of paratroopers to depart for Pristina on Ilyushin Il-76 military transport aircraft. Fearing that Russian aircraft were heading for the airport, Clark planned to order helicopters to block the runway, and requested helicopter support from Admiral Ellis. Jackson's staff contacted the US brigade and were told that the Americans were using their right to opt out of the operation. Two hours later they called to say that the operation was back on again. However, poor weather conditions rendered this impossible at that time. The following morning, Sunday 13 June, Clark arrived at Jackson's HQ in Skopje. It was pointed out to Clark that the Russians were isolated and could not be reinforced by air and that Russian support had been a vital part of getting a peace agreement; antagonising them would only be counterproductive. Clark refused to accept this and continued to order that the runway be blocked, claiming to be supported by the NATO Secretary-General. Jackson refused to enforce Clark's orders, reportedly telling him \\"I'm not going to start the Third World War for you.\\" When again directly ordered to block the runway, Jackson suggested that British tanks and armoured cars would be more suitable, in the knowledge that this would almost certainly be vetoed by the British government. Clark agreed. Jackson was ready to resign rather than follow Clark's order. The British Ministry of Defence authorised British force commander Richard Dannatt to use 4 Armoured Brigade to isolate the airfield but not to block the runways. James Blunt has been quoted as saying he would rather have faced a court martial than use force against the Russians. Clark's orders were not carried out, and the United States instead placed political pressure on neighbouring states to not allow Russia to use their airspace to ferry in reinforcements. Russia was forced to call off the reinforcements after Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania refused requests by Russia to use their airspace. Negotiations were conducted throughout the stand-off, during which Russia insisted that its troops would only be answerable to Russian commanders, and that it retain an exclusive zone for its own peacekeepers. NATO refused these concessions, predicting that it would lead to the partition of Kosovo into an Albanian south and a Serbian north. Both sides eventually agreed that Russian peacekeepers would deploy throughout Kosovo, but independently of NATO. Aftermath After an agreement had been secured, Pristina Airport was reactivated by Britain‚Äôs 53 Field Squadron (Air Support) of the Royal Engineers as a military airbase on 15 October 1999, then international air transport resumed to several European cities. During that period, the Russian KFOR along with NATO forces were in charge of security for the airport. Wesley Clark was subsequently advised by General Hugh Shelton, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the US, to leave his NATO post early.

This regiment was established in its current form on June 9, 1953. It reports to the Central Security Bureau (formerly the 9th Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security). In 1976, Wang Dongxing, Chairman Mao Zedong's long-time security chief, brought the 8341 Special Regiment into the Huairen Hall and arrested the Gang of Four on the order of Mao's designated successor, Hua Guofeng, an action which significantly helped to end the Chinese Cultural Revolution.  History  During the Chinese Civil War, the core of the future 8341 Regiment was called the Chinese Peoples' Public Security Center Column (Chinese: ‰∏≠ÂõΩ‰∫∫Ê∞ëÂÖ¨ÂÆâ‰∏≠Â§ÆÁ∫µÈòü), 2nd Division, 4th Regiment. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China it was attached to the Ministry of Public Security. In 1951, the force changed its name to Central Guard Division (or Central Corps of Guards). In 1953, it was renamed the Chinese Central Guard Regiment (Designation name is \\"Center 001\\", Chinese: ÊÄªÂ≠ó001). In the late 1950s, its designation changed again to Regiment 3747. Around 1964, it first used the name of \\"Regiment 8341\\". In 1975, it changed once again to the \\"57001 Regiment\\" but soon reverted to the designation \\"8341 Special Regiment\\". In 1976, after the death of Mao Zedong, the regiment changed its designation once more to the \\"57003 Regiment\\". In October 2000, it underwent its latest name change, becoming the 61889 Regiment, the designation still used at present.  Anecdote  The regimental code of \\"8341\\" has inspired a number of stories about why it was chosen. One such tale is that in 1948, when Mao Zedong and the other leaders of the Chinese Communist Party first moved to Beijing, Mao talked with a monk of Tayuan Temple, at Mount Wutai, Shanxi Province. The monk gave him this number, which meant that Mao Zedong would live to be 83 years old and would lead the CCP for 41 years (from Zunyi Conference to his death). Besides, there are also some other explanations.Ê±ÇÂæóÊÖßÂøÉ‰∫îÂè∞ÂΩí However, according to the first regimental commander Zhang Yaoci, this code was only arranged by the People's Liberation Army General Staff Department, and the other stories did not have any reasonable evidence.

It is believed to be \\"Scotland's first school of fine art\\" and the first art college in Britain. It is a registered charity under Scottish law. A range of prominent Scottish artists have worked there, including Joan Eardley, Peter Howson, Will Maclean, Robert Colquhoun, Robert MacBryde, William Gear, Alasdair Gray, Wendy McMurdo, and Callum Innes. Early history Hospitalfield House was founded in the 13th century by Tironesian monks from nearby Arbroath Abbey as a leprosy and plague hospice called the \\"Hospital of St John the Baptist\\". It was purchased and extended by James Fraser in 1665. Walter Scott stayed in the house in 1803 and 1809 and used it as his model for \\"Monkbarns\\" in his novel The Antiquary (1816). See Hospital of St John the Baptist, Arbroath for a detailed account of the early history of the House together with sources. Patrick Allan-Fraser (1812-90) In the mid 19th century, Hospitalfield House was expanded by Patrick Allan-Fraser, a patron of the arts. Allan-Fraser, the son of an Arbroath weaving merchant, studied art in Edinburgh and was once president of the British Academy of Art in Rome. In Arbroath, he completed a series of paintings for an edition of Scott's The Antiquary. After acquiring the Hospitalfield estate through marriage he embarked on a substantial remodelling programme. His scheme used mainly local craftsmen and converted an eighteenth-century barn into a gallery, added a five-storey bartizan and a large wing. He had a keen interest in the arts and set up the Patrick Allan-Fraser of Hospitalfield Trust to support young artists. The building was bequeathed \\"for the promotion of Education in the Arts\\" on the death of Allan-Fraser in 1890, having no heirs to his estate. Present day The house is now a residential art centre, music, and conference venue. It is open to the public for four open weekends a year and for other events, including afternoon tours on the first Wednesday of the month. In 2015 Hospitalfield curated and organised Graham Fagen's exhibition for Scotland + Venice, a Collateral Event of the 56th International Art Exhibition ‚Äì La Biennale di Venezia. In 2008, it was used as a film location for the docu-drama \\"Children of the Dead End\\" starring Stephen Rea. Architecture =Exterior= The red sandstone building is in the Gothic style and draws on medieval domestic architecture. Allan-Fraser was heavily indebted to the Arts and Crafts Movement. This is evident in the design of the building which features crenallated parapets, Crow-stepped gables, and Oriel Windows. In 1901, a new studio block was added with north-west facing windows. A smaller room contains a skylight and there are yards for outdoor sculpture. =Interior= Allan-Fraser wanted to create an inspiring space for young artists and the interior displays a large collection of Victorian sculpture, paintings, and wood-carvings which are of \\"international importance\\". The interior design features include Romanesque dado arcading and a Hammerbeam roof. The main public rooms in the house are the dining room, picture gallery and adjoining cedar room and anteroom. Two 17th century tapestries were obtained in the 1870s for the first floor drawing room to reflect a passage in The Antiquary. Chandeliers inside the house were obtained from the Guildhall in Birmingham. The gallery contains armorial references to the Fraser family who owned the estate from 1665 and the Parrott family, of Hawkesbury Hall who joined the Fraser estate in the 19th century. Allan-Fraser commissioned self- portraits from members of The Clique, an art group he had known as a young man. These included John Phillip, Augustus Egg, William Powell Frith, Henry O'Neil, and Edward Matthew Ward. The Trial of Effie Deans (1840) by Robert Scott Lauder hangs on the main landing. A painting of Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon by James Peter Quinn hung in Hospitalfield's gallery during the Second World War. The library contains books dating from 16th to 19th centuries.

Purposes  This Congressionally mandated group was formed in November 1978, by Public Law 95-622, succeeding the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research. It was created to study bio-ethical issues such as the effects of income and residence on the availability of healthcare, the definition of death, patient consent, human research subjects, and genetic engineering, counseling and testing. The commission met a total of 28 times and ultimately published 11 reports, two of which were made up of three volumes, on these topics and their implications. These reports expanded upon ideas originally established in the 1945 Nuremberg Codes and the Belmont Report. Additionally, a guidebook for Institutional Review Boards was published by the commission in 1981.  History  Jimmy Carter appointed the eleven original members of the commission in July of 1979 and the Senate confirmed Morris B. Abram as the chairman of the commission on September 29, 1979. The commissioners were sworn in by Judge David L. Bazelon at the White House on January 1, 1980 and proceeded to hold the first meeting that day. Six additional commissioners were sworn in as replacements were needed. The commission worked independently from January 1980 to March 31, 1983 when its authority expired. The meeting files, correspondences, and unpublished papers from the commission are currently held in the Bioethics Research Library Kennedy Institute of Ethics at Georgetown University. Multiple government formed organizations continued to fulfill the commission's purposes after its expiration, most specifically the Bioethical Medical Advisory Committee which was created in 1988.

The Spaniards resisted until the arrival of the Spanish army under Don Fernando √Ålvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba, causing the withdrawal of the French army. The siege was one of the costliest defeats of Francis I in the French offensive of 1542. French offensive of 1542 In June, 1541, Francis I of France, allied with the United Duchies of J√ºlich-Cleves-Berg, the Ottoman Empire, Denmark, and Sweden, made a show of the power at his disposal, by arriving with five armies.Lafuente p.208Lafuente p.209Knecht p.479 Francis declared war on 12 July 1542, and the French immediately launched an offensive with the five French armies against Charles.Knecht p.480 One of them, commanded by his son Charles, Duke of Orl√©ans went to Luxembourg. Another, led by Francis's eldest son, Henry, Dauphin of France, marched to Roussillon towards the frontiers of Spain. The third, commanded by Marshal Maarten van Rossum marched over Brabant, the fourth under the Duke of Vend√¥me to the Netherlands, and the fifth went to the Piedmont commanded by the Marshal of France Claude d'Annebault. The result of this new offensive was another failure for Francis I. In Flanders, the army of Maarten van Rossum, supported by a German army under the Duke of J√ºlich-Cleves-Berg, came up against a strong Imperial-Spanish defense of Leuven and Antwerp. The Duke of Orleans attacked Luxembourg, and in the meantime, in Piedmont, the French army only managed to capture some towns due to the cunning of Claude d'Annebault. In southern France, in Roussillon, the army commanded by Henry, Dauphin of France, consisting of 40,000 men, supported by the army of Marshal Claude d'Annebault, laid siege to Perpignan, after losing valuable time which was used by the Emperor Charles to strengthen the towns of Salses, Fuenterrab√≠a, and Perpignan. Siege of Perpignan Henry of France by Fran√ßois Clouet. Duke of Alba by Anthonis Mor. Perpignan had been reinforced by the Emperor, which was held by several nobles of Castile and their troops, and also several hundred veteran Spanish soldiers. Henry, who thought it would be an easy conquest, encountered fierce resistance. In a clever move of the Spanish, the defenders led by the Captains Cervell√≥n and Machichaco, attacked the French besiegers by surprise and destroyed most of the heavy artillery with which it had already begun to damage the walls, causing a severe blow to the French army. After many hardships for the French, and without any hope that the Ottoman Empire would help them, the town was eventually relieved by the army of the Duke of Alba, forcing the French commander, the Dauphin of France, to lift the siege, prompting the withdrawal of the French. The siege incurred a very heavy loss in dead, sick, and wounded among the French ranks, becoming a resounding French failure. It is during the siege of Perpignan that the French barber surgeon Ambroise Par√©, accompanying the French army, had the idea for a new technique. During the battle, Mar√©chal de Brissac was wounded, having been shot in the shoulder. As the bullet was impossible to find for extraction, Par√© had the idea to ask the victim to put himself in the exact position he was in when shot. The bullet was then found and removed by Henry's personal surgeon Nicole Lavernault.Fabricio Cardenas, Vieux papiers des Pyr√©n√©es- Orientales, Ambroise Par√© √† Perpignan en 1542 , 13 February 2015 Consequences When the Emperor's power seemed broken after the African disaster, Francis I was far from reaping the benefits of an effort that ended up being rather costly, and he couldn't reply with the reputation he had acquired throughout Europe. The two monarchs Charles I of Spain and Francis I of France, used up the remainder of the year to prepare new campaigns. On the French part, Frances I did everything possible to obtain military support from the Ottoman Empire, persuading Suleiman the Magnificent to return to Hungary and attack Charles of Austria's possessions, while the Ottoman Admiral, Hayreddin Barbarossa, attacked the Spanish and Italian coasts.Lafuente p.211 In Europe, the French, under Antoine de Bourbon, Duke of Vend√¥me, captured Lillers in April, and Marshal Claude d'Annebault had taken Landrecies.Knecht p.486 Wilhelm of Cleves invaded Brabant, and the fight began in Artois and Hainaut.Knecht p.487 King Francis inexplicably halted with his army near Rheims; in the meantime, Charles attacked Wilhelm, invading the Duchy of Julich and capturing D√ºren. The Duke of Orl√©ans captured Luxembourg on 10 September, but the French conquest was useless, and Luxembourg was recaptured by the Imperial troops under the Prince of Orange. The Duke of J√ºlich-Cleves- Berg surrendered on 7 September, signing the Treaty of Venlo with the Emperor.

Together, the pair won four Olympic gold medals, three gold and one silver World Equestrian Games medals, and numerous other international championships. Although known as a sensitive horse prone to spookiness, Rembrandt's elegance and expression in the ring allowed him to become one of the top horses in the sport of dressage. Early life Rembrandt was foaled in 1977 by Herbert de Baey. His sire was Romadour II, a famous Westphalian stallion during the 1970s, and his dam was Adone, full sister to Ahlerich, a multiple Olympic medal winning dressage horse under German rider Reiner Klimke. Due to his Thoroughbred-like appearance, several riders passed over a chance to purchase the gelding as a youngster. In 1981, he was purchased by Nicole Uphoff's father, J√ºrgen Uphoff, as a mount for his then-14-year-old daughter. Rembrandt was too much for her, however, and he was sent to train with Klaus Balkenhol, a noted trainer who saw his potential and advised the Uphoffs to keep the horse, despite his spookiness and sensitivity. Competitive career In 1985, Rembrandt and Uphoff began to compete at events for young riders, and in 1986, the pair began working with Uwe Schulten-Baumer, a well-known dressage coach. In 1987, the pair began to compete, and win, at the international level. They rose to the top of the dressage world with unheard-of speed, due to Rembrandt's elegance and expression in the ring. Their rise to fame resulted in a 1988 Olympic nomination. Uphoff switched trainers four months before the Games began, leaving Schulten-Baumer to work with Harry Boldt, the German national coach. Rembrandt and Uphoff were Olympic Champions twice, in 1988 in Seoul and 1992 in Barcelona. Both times they took both individual gold and a gold medal with the German team. The Barcelona games resulted in Rembrandt being titled a \\"living work of art\\" by one German sports commentator. During the last two years of his career, Rembrandt began to decline slightly, and he missed the team nomination to the 1996 Summer Olympics. Uphoff used her right as defending champion to compete as an individual, and they were again part of the German team in Atlanta, where the pair eventually placed 14th. This placement was despite being pulled from competition before the last round, due to an injury, at which point he was in 8th place. Rembrandt and Uphoff took both individual and team gold at the first World Equestrian Games in 1990. In 1993, he was injured by a kick from another horse during a victory lap at the German Championships, but recovered from the blow to take individual silver at the 1994 World Equestrian Games. The German team, including Uphoff, again took gold. Rembrandt and Uphoff also competed at many other international-level events. In 1989, Rembrandt made his European Dressage Championships debut at Mondorf, Luxembourg, where they took both individual and team gold. It was the first time that the gold-medal winning German team (which had also won the previous 12 team golds) had been made up of four female riders. In 1991, at the Championships in Donaueschingen, Germany, the pair took silver in the Grand Prix Special, while again riding to gold as part of the German team. The silver medal was the first defeat in three years for the pair, and was dealt by another Schulten-Baumer student, Isabell Werth on Gigolo FRH. At the 1995 Championships, held in Mondorf, Luxembourg, Rembrandt again assisted the German team to a gold medal, while taking 5th individually. The pair also won seven times at the Stuttgart German Masters international show, the last in 1995. This was a record number of wins until 2010, when Werth won for an eighth time, and Uphoff remains the only rider to have won seven masters titles on a single horse (Werth rode three different horses to her eight victories). Later life and legacy In 1996, Rembrandt and Uphoff gave a farewell show at his official retirement at the Stuttgart Indoor Show. He spent the rest of his life at Uphoff's farm. On October 30, 2001, he was euthanized after his health deteriorated quickly and he was unable to rise. Rembrandt's transitions, particularly from passage to extended trot back to passage, have been called \\"unequalled\\". He was also known for his spookiness, however, to the point that crowds hushed themselves when he was performing. He is known as a \\"legendary\\" dressage horse, and mounted upon Rembrandt, Nicole Uphoff pioneered an era of female-dominated dressage competitions. In 2009, Uphoff donated Rembrandt's saddle to the equestrian museum at CHIO Aachen in Germany.

Dated 50 BC-150 AD, Parthian School. The Shami statue is one of the main surviving works of Parthian art. It is currently in the National Museum of Iran (Inv. no. 2401) and was found at Shami (modern Kh≈´zestƒÅn Province), where there was an ancient sanctuary. The bronze statue is 1.94 m high. The man depicted is shown frontally. The figure's head is slightly too small in relation to the rest of its body and the face has a plain, unmodelled surface with an aquiline nose. The man bears a short beard and a heavy moustache, while his hair is long and covers the ears. Around the head he wears a wide ribbon. He wears a tunic with a V-shaped opening at the front and wears trousers. Around the neck he wears a necklace, perhaps a metal ring. The left hand and the entire right arm are missing. In Shami, however, there was found a bronze arm which might belong to this statue. It is possible that the head and the body of the figure were crafted separately and put together in Shami, as the head is too small and made from a different type of bronze as to the rest of the statue. The high quality of the art work caused some speculations of its production place. Some scholars believe that it was made by Greek or Roman artists.R.R.R.

Schlumberger: L'Orient Hellenise, Paris 1970, p. 156-157 (the nearest bigger ancient city). The statue was found by local peasants but must have originally adorned a sanctuary at Shami, where several Hellenistic bronze statues were found. The statue depicts a nobleman from the Parthian Empire. The statue is hard to date.

Establishment Hedwigs Hill was settled by German settlers Christopher Voges and Louis (Ludwig) Martin, who emigrated to Texas with the Adelsverein groups. Voges arrived at Galveston on January 2, 1846, on the Gesina Gesina, January 2, 1846, Galveston Historical Foundation Immigration Database originally destined to settle in Comal County. Martin disembarked at Galveston on November 23, 1844, from the Johann Detthard,Detthard, November 23, 1844, Galveston Historical Foundation Immigration Database and was with the first settlers of Fredericksburg. In 1853 the Martin family moved south of what is now Mason, on the banks of the Llano River. The settlement became known as Hedwigs Hill, thought to be named for Martin's mother and daughter, both of whom shared the name Hedwig. John Kline was another early settler, who is thought to have built the dogtrot house later occupied by Louis Martin. In 1971, Martin's home was moved to the National Ranching Heritage Center. Post office Louis Martin was the first postmaster of Hedwigs Hill in 1858, succeeded by D.B. Anderson in 1861. His nephew Charles Karl Martin became postmaster on August 21, 1861, after Texas had joined the Confederate States of America. Charles was reappointed postmaster by the Union on April 10, 1866 to service the San Antonio-El Paso Mail. Conrad Gustavus became postmaster on November 23, 1866. The post office was discontinued March 17, 1868. Charles was again appointed postmaster to a re-established post office on May 18, 1874, a position he held until his 1879 death. His widow Anna Mebus Martin took over the postmaster position on December 9, 1879. John Keller became postmaster on June 14, 1899, and held the position until the post office was discontinued on April 15, 1907. Thereafter, the mail was directed to Mason. Commerce Both Martin families were farmers and ranchers, engaging in the business of freight transport. On June 16, 1864, on a freight hauling trip to Piedras Negras, Coahuila, Louis Martin and his niece's husband Eugene Frantzen had gold hidden beneath a load of bacon. They were ambushed at Eagle Pass and hanged by deserters from the Confederate States Army. Anna and Charles Martin ran the community store at Hedwig Hill. When Charles became disabled because of rheumatism, Anna became the business person in the family. She grew the business and branched out into wool, cotton, barbed wire, and cattle. She eventually acquired 50,000 acres in Mason, Llano and Gillespie Counties, at the time making her one of the wealthiest Texans of German ancestry. Martin established the Commercial Bank of Mason in 1901, which she ran with her two sons for 24 years. Anna Martin died on July 10, 1925, and is buried in the family cemetery at Hedwig's Hill. Churches and school In 1870, a Methodist Episcopal church became the first church in the area, later joined by Art Methodist Church and Hilda Methodist Church. The Louis Martin family was Catholic and often held services in their home. Hedwig Hill had a school in the district from the late 1800s to early 1900s. Later years The Hedwig population began a decline in the early 1900s, dwindling to a population of 10 in the 1950s, where it remained in 2000. Climate The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the K√∂ppen climate classification system, Hedwigs Hill has a humid subtropical climate, Cfa on climate maps.Climate Summary for Hedwigs Hill, Texas References Further reading  External links * Mason County Historical Commission Category:Unincorporated communities in Mason County, Texas Category:Unincorporated communities in Texas Category:German-American history Category:German-American culture in Texas Category:Ghost towns in Central Texas ","title":"Hedwigs Hill, Texas"},{"id":"30584223","text":"Frithjof Prydz (15 July 1943 - 8 December 1992) was a Norwegian ski jumper and tennis player.

Over the course of his nearly 50-year career, Dr. Olmo bred a wide variety of both grapes by means of both crossing varieties from the same species or creating hybrid grapes from cultivars of different Vitis species. Over 30 new grape varieties were created by Dr. Olmo and introduced to the California wine and table grape industries. Ruby Cabernet Ruby Cabernet wine. Ruby Cabernet is the most notable and widely planted Olmo grape. It is a crossing between the Vitis vinifera varieties Cabernet Sauvignon and Carignan that was first trialed by Dr. Olmo in 1936 before being released in 1948. The grape is primarily used in blending, adding color and tartness, but producers such as E & J Gallo Winery have produced varietal wines from the grape. According to wine expert Jancis Robinson, Ruby Cabernet can have some aromas reminiscent of a young Cabernet Sauvignon with the color of a Carignan but it lacks the structure and body to produce premium wines.Robinson, Jancis Vines, Grapes & Wines Mitchell Beazley pgs 226-227, 264-265 1986 In California, the variety is widely planted in the Central Valley where it can withstand the hot continental climate of the valley and still produce harvest yields of 6 to 9 tons an acre. Outside of California, the variety can also be found in Australia, Argentina, Chile, Israel and South Africa. Rubired Rubired is a hybrid of the vinifera variety Tinto C√£o and Alicante Ganzin, which itself is a hybrid of Vitis rupestris Armon Rupestris Ganzin No. 4 and the vinifera crossing Alicante Bouschet. Trial breeding and testing were completed by Olmo in 1958. Like Ruby Cabernet, it was bred to produce significant yields in hot climates, and in the California Central Valley it regularly yields 8 to 10 tons per acre. However, Rubired is a teinturier variety with pigmented, instead of clear, juice. Most red wine grapes have clear juice, the red color of wines coming from extraction of pigment from the grape skins. Rubired was originally intended for producing fortified port-style wines, and since the late 20th century, producers in Australia have included it in some port-style blends. Its intensely dark color is often useful in blending to intensify the color of other red wines, but it can also be used to create varietal wines. Emerald Riesling Emerald Riesling is a white wine grape crossing between the vinifera varieties Riesling and Muscadelle. Trials on the variety began in 1936 and the variety was released in 1948 at the same time as Ruby Cabernet. Unlike many of the cool climate Riesling crossings produced in Germany at facilities like Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute, the Emerald Riesling was bred for warm climates like the San Joaquin Valley of California where today more than half of all Emerald Riesling plantings are found. Outside of California, there are limited plantings in South Africa. It is also used quite extensively in Israel, where big wineries use it to produce light, and aromatic - usually off-dry - wines. It comprises roughly 2.6% of the total grape production in Israel, totaling (in 2012) 1,408 tons. Israel Wine Board, 2012 According to wine expert Jancis Robinson, Emerald Riesling produces an aromatic, high acid wine that doesn't quite have the flavor definition more commonly associated with Riesling or its cool climate crossings. In cooler climate areas where it has been planted, such as the Monterey AVA, it can share some traits with Riesling but with a distinctly fuller body. Emerald Riesling is also known under the synonyms California 1139 E 29, Emerald Rizling, and Riesling Izumrudnii.Emerald Riesling, Vitis International Variety Catalogue, accessed 2010-07-15 Other wine grapes Dr. Olmo frequently used Carignan (pictured) in his crossings. *Carnelian is a crossing of the Vitis vinifera Carignan and a separate vinifera crossing between Cabernet Sauvignon and Grenache. It was created in 1972 to combine the genetic traits that allow Carignan and Grenache to produce well in warm climates with some of flavor and wine characteristics of Cabernet Sauvignon. *Centurian (also known as Centurion) is a vinifera crossing between Carignan and a separate crossing of Cabernet Sauvignon and Grenache.

Obo (1882‚Äì1895), was an American Cocker Spaniel who is considered to be the father of the modern breed, though physically, he was different from today's American Cocker. During his day, he was a successful show dog, winner of many Best-in-Show titles. Background The Obo kennel of Spaniels were owned by James Farrow, who was breeding dogs from the 1870s onwards. Obo's sire and namesake, Obo, was whelped on June 14, 1879. F. E. Schofield, an authority on Spaniels, wrote, \\"Obo, it goes without saying, was the greatest force in the revival of the Cocker.\\"Lloyd (1939): p. 16 Obo was so well known for his victories in conformation shows that his owner, Farrow, spoke of an offer made from America, \\"The dog's stock did so well in America that one hundred guineas was offered by an American breeder for the use of this Spaniel for one season's stud service. The offer was refused.\\"Lloyd (1939): p. 18 Birth and career J. P. Willey of Salmon Falls, New Hampshire, was already a cocker spaniel breeder in America when he attempted to purchase Obo from Farrow in England. He was turned down, but managed to purchase Chloe II, a successful female Cocker Spaniel show dog and had her mated to Obo prior to her being shipped to the United States.Mercer (1890): p. 111 From Chloe II's litter came two males, Obo and Black Silk, and a female named Black Gem. Black Gem would die from distemper after returning from winning the Produce Stake at a New York show. Obo was shown for the first time at Manchester, New Hampshire in September 1883, where he placed first. He would go on to have further wins at Lowell, New Haven, Connecticut and New York City. Obo II's trophy for Best Cocker Spaniel from the New Haven Kennel Club show in 1884 was gifted to the American Spaniel Club in 2004. Obo's American Kennel Club number was 4911.Mercer (1890): p. 121 His puppies were also highly successful, winning puppy prizes at Lowell, first and second at New York and the top three puppy places at New Haven. Four of his best known offspring are Red Brucie, Sandspring Surmise, Midcliff Miracle Man and Limestone Laddie. In addition, Obo II was the sire of the first dark red Cocker Spaniel in America, Little Miss Rover. Death and legacy Modern writers consider Obo to be the father of the modern American Cocker Spaniel. He was different from the modern breed, being tall with a long body. Obo died on January 2, 1895, and was buried on the property of his owner in Salmon Falls village in Rollinsford. Today, the grave is located behind the Rollinsford Grade School in the town of Rollinsford. At the request of the American Spaniel Club, the grave site was registered with the Rollinsford Historical Society as a historical monument. Grave marker of Obo II.. The gravestone is listed to the National Register of Historic Places as a contributing resource to Rollinsford Grade School.

As a skilled builder of both buildings and ships, his father Joseph was a leading member of local society. Although the family spent some time living in Marietta during the Northwest Indian War and during a winter after their farm was destroyed by fire, they typically lived on a property several miles up the Muskingum River from its mouth at Marietta. Like his father, who held the office from 1830 to 1842,Andrews, Martin R., ed. History of Marietta and Washington County, Ohio and Representative Citizens.

Before this time, he had served in the Ohio General Assembly in the early 1830s. Judge Barker's home was constructed by his father Joseph, a colonel in the Ohio militia; although Colonel Barker built many prominent houses throughout Washington County, very few survive to the present day. For this reason, Judge Barker's house is among the most significant of the county's historic buildings. In 1979, the Judge Joseph Barker House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Qualifying it for this distinction were its historically significant architecture and its association with the elder Barker. It is one of thirty- five Washington County places to be listed on the Register; among the other thirty-four is the home of the judge's father, which lies along Masonic Home Road north of Marietta. It is no longer a residence, having been converted into a government office under the ownership of the Army Corps of Engineers by the late 1970s.

By 1918, he was editor of the Social Democratic Party of Germany's newspaper in Aschaffenburg. In 1921 he was convicted of libel and sentenced to 6 months in prison after accusing the major of hoarding food. He fled to Wiesbaden, then under French occupation, where he worked as editor of the magazine \\"The Torch\\" (Die Fackel). In early 1923, he was co-founder of the \\"Rheinischer Unabh√§ngigkeitsbund\\", which sought independence for the Rhineland. In October 1923, he and his supporters seized the city of Koblenz in a putsch, founding the Rhenish Republic with Matthes as its leader. The power of the new government relied essentially on the French occupiers and the \\"Rhineland- protection forces\\". A massive wave of looting by the peacekeepers led to resistance in the population. By November riots led to killings in clashes between the security forces and opponents of the separatists. The strength of the resistance proved too much for the government and the \\"Republic\\" collapsed. Matthes fled to France. By 1930, he was working as a journalist in Paris.

Many people around Pakistan request their fellows to bring it as it is not widely available in any other part of Pakistan. Sesame candy is also traditional to northern Iran (Mazandaran province) and is called Peshtezik in Mazandarani and Persian. Peshtezik is usually a thin flat layer of sesame seed with sugar or honey and often includes nuts (specially walnuts). Peshtezik is served in special Persian holidays such as Nowruz and Yalda. In the Middle East (Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, Syria), it is called simsimiyah or simismiyeh and is either made as a thin crunchy layer or a slightly thicker chewy candy. In Indonesia, sesame seed candy is known as Ting-Ting Wijen, while the version with peanuts is called Ting-Ting Kacang. These types of candy are influenced by the Chinese. In Poland, sesame seed candy is known as sezamki and usually consists only of sesame seeds in thin layers of honey without any nuts.

Born to a prominent attorney in New York, Stewart studied law in Minnesota and became the first African American lawyer in the state of Oregon. His lack of financial success in Oregon led him to eventually move to San Francisco, where failing vision led him to commit suicide. Living in the era of Plessy v. Ferguson and \\"separate but equal\\" doctrine, his life was said to \\"reflect an unyielding commitment to the principle of justice for all powerless people in the northwest.\\"J. Clay Smith, Jr, In the Shadow of Plessy: A Portrait of McCants Stewart, Afro-American Legal Pioneer., 73 Minn. L. Rev. 495 (1988). Biography =Early years= Born in Brooklyn, New York, Stewart was the eldest son of T. McCants Stewart (1853‚Äì1923), a noted black lawyer, civil rights leader and confidant of Booker T. Washington, whose career took him from South Carolina to New York City, Hawaii, London to serving as an Associate Justice of the Liberian Supreme Court,Stewart, T. McCants (1853-1923), BlackPast.org, Accessed January 22, 2011. and Charlotte L. Harris Stewart, herself a graduate of Wilberforce University. His father's friendship with Washington began before the latter rose to national prominence with the 1895 Atlanta Compromise speech, and the elder Stewart embraced Washington's principles of thrift, self-help and moral reform, instilling those values on his three children at an early age. His brother, Gilchrist, would also become and attorney and his sister, Carlotta Stewart Lai, would help develop Hawaii's public education system. Stewart attended public schools in New York.Albert S. Broussard, \\"McCants Stewart: The Struggles of a Black Attorney in the Urban West,\\" Oregon Historical Quarterly 89 (1988), 157-79; requires access to JSTOR, which is available either by subscription or via free access through a number of academic institutions. At age sixteen, and at their father's request, Stewart and his brother enrolled at Washington's Tuskegee Institute in Alabama in 1893. In its twelfth year, the black college stressed industrial education with strong principles of self-reliance in a strict environment. Stewart did not immediately accept the school's rigid structure, and rebelled in ways that brought the increasing displeasure of Washington. The conflict came to a head in July 1894, as the school council voted to expel Stewart from the institution. In October 1894, and with Margaret Murray Washington's intervention, he was readmitted. Back at school, he studied piano and voice, but his main interest became debate, where he became known for his considerable skill. He graduated in 1896. Immediately after finishing at Tuskegee, Stewart moved to New York and enrolled at New York University, where he earned a law certificate in 1896 and worked as a legal assistant in his father's law office. A strong follower of Washington's principles, Stewart's father operated his office and his business relationship with his son under strict guidelines. He required that his son sign a contract which specified his employment and compensation in detail, noting that \\"my intention is to pay you $3 per week to cover your fare, lunches; allow you 5% of all my fees; at 21, I shall make you Notary Public and put your name on the door.\\" =Minnesota= This c. 1901 image of Stewart is on display in the University of Minnesota Law Library, and notes the two degrees he received at the Law School. After a year of working under his father, Stewart grew tired of the strict arrangement and moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota to attend the University of Minnesota Law School. His reason for choosing a northern school in a state with a small black population was never revealed, however the change in environment gave Stewart a new sense of purpose and maturity. Unlike his years at Tuskegee, he was a model graduate student in Minnesota: he excelled academically, wrote from the school newspaper and was an active member of a literary society. He again participated in a debate society, and was elected secretary of the senior class and sheriff of the moot court, officiating all moot court sessions at the school. During his senior year, his fellow Tuskegee alumnus and University of Minnesota Law student Jay Moses Griffin recruited him to work as business manager of a local newspaper, the Twin-City American. He later served in the same position for the Afro-American Advance, becoming a visible figure in the black community. During his time at the Law School, Stewart challenged discrimination from a Minneapolis restaurant that refused to serve him a meal because of his race. Several other patrons observed the incident and left their names with Stewart, who filed an administrative complaint with the Minneapolis City Attorney's Office under the recently passed 1897 state civil rights law. After an investigation, the office filed the first prosecution under the law, charging the owner with violating Stewart's civil rights. The owner had previously served black patrons, but once their numbers had risen his white customers dropped off; once he made objections to the black patrons, they also left him. The trial was well attended, and the jury needed only fifteen minutes of deliberation to convict the owner on the charges.Minneapolis., The Appeal, March 19, 1898, accessed January 24, 2011.Minneapolis., The Appeal, March 26, 1898, accessed January 24, 2011. Stewart received an LL.B. in 1899. That June, alongside his classmates, Stewart was sworn into the state bar by Minnesota Supreme Court Chief Justice Charles M. Start.SIXTY NEW LAWYERS, \\"U\\" Class of 1899 is Formally Admitted to Practice, St. Paul Daily Globe, June 3, 1899, accessed January 22, 2011. He set up a legal practice in the Twin Cities, however he also continued working for the newspapers to help finance his continuing education at the Law School. It was during this time he met his future wife, Mary Delia \\"Mayme\\" Weir of Minneapolis, who was a student at the University of Minnesota. Noted as an excellent orator, he was invited to give testimonials as well as participate in public debates on race issues.Race Problem Debated, The Minneapolis Journal, April 10, 1901, accessed January 22, 2011.Minneapolis., The Appeal, April 20, 1901, accessed January 22, 2011.Minneapolis., The Appeal, April 27, 1901, accessed January 22, 2011.

In the years immediately following his graduation, Stewart continued to make his home in Minneapolis and speak to crowds in the Twin Cities.Minneapolis., The Appeal, March 23, 1904, accessed January 22, 2011. An active member of the Republican Party, he was elected Secretary of the Hennepin County Republican Club in 1902.Minneapolis., The Appeal, July 26, 1902, accessed January 22, 2011. However, he began testing the market out west and by March 1904 he had decided that it made more business sense to practice law elsewhere and decided to permanently move to Portland, Oregon.Minneapolis., The Appeal, March 14, 1904, accessed January 22, 2011. He returned to Minneapolis several times after moving, most notably to marry on August 22, 1905.Minneapolis., The Appeal, August 19, 1905, accessed January 22, 2011.Marriage Licenses, The Minneapolis Journal, August 22, 1905, accessed January 22, 2011. His wife was a graduate of the University of Minnesota and a music school, and had been a teacher in the Minneapolis public school system. Their wedding, held in Minneapolis, was called \\"the most notable event of the week in social circles\\" of the city's black community.Minneapolis., The Appeal, August 26, 1905, accessed January 22, 2011. Their only child, daughter Mary Katherine, was born a year later. =Oregon= Stewart with his daughter, 1907. Stewart began spending time in Oregon in 1903. He was allowed to represent clients in local Portland courts before passing the bar examination, and was assigned as the public defender in a few cases in 1903. Like the Twin Cities, Portland's black community was small when Stewart permanently settled there in 1904. Most African Americans were service workers or unskilled, menial laborers, though there were some black-owned businesses. Stewart's father was disappointed in his son's decision to move to Portland, noting \\"But for the life of me, I can't see why you are 'using up' your life where you are\\", suggesting his son try moving abroad like he had. Stewart disregarded the advice and remained in Oregon, and was the first African American admitted to the state bar on March 1, 1901.McCants Stewart (1877-1919), Oregon Historical Society, Accessed January 22, 2011. After setting up his office in Portland, Stewart struggled to make a decent living. The black population of Oregon remained below 1% of the state's total population until World War II. Race relations of the time dictated that white Oregonians rarely hired black attorneys, and the even smaller number of educated, wealthy blacks did not offer much of a market. Stewart also took on Japanese clients. His wife did not work, nor did the couple own property; he earned most of his money from small legal fees. Stewart did earn the respect of his legal colleagues; among them, Oregon Supreme Court Associate Justice Henry L. Benson wrote that he \\"has established an exceptional record for industry and ability as a lawyer and his work before the Supreme Court has been commendable.\\" Stewart had been the first African American lawyer to argue a case before the Oregon Supreme Court in State v. Browning (1905). In the case, he challenged the Portland Municipal Police Court's jurisdiction over a matter of state law. Though the court ruled against him, it did so with difficulty and the case drew Stewart positive attention and respect. 1907 photo of (from left to right) McCants Stewart, his daughter Mary Katherine Stewart, sister Carlotta Stewart Lai (standing), wife Mayme Delia Weir (seated), and sister-in-law Harriett Anna Weir. The highlight of his legal career was his successful argument of the 1906 civil rights case of Taylor v. Cohn. The case involved Oliver Taylor, a black Pullman car porter, who was required to sit in the balcony at a Portland theater. When informed that the theater prohibited the seating of blacks on the main floor, the plaintiff refused to exchange his tickets and sued the owner for $5000. Stewart argued that protecting the rights of blacks against discrimination was accepted as a matter of public policy, despite Oregon's lack of a civil rights bill. At the time, Oregon was more racially progressive than other western states, with state law not segregating schools, housing or public accommodations; though interracial marriage was prohibited. The state's largest newspaper, The Oregonian, sided with the theater owner's right to exclude any race from its premises; it editorialized that \\"Colored people are wise to accept conditions that they cannot change or control, and go their way cheerfully\\", further asserting that \\"it is a well known fact\\" that whites objected to sitting next to blacks. In his brief, Stewart argued that \\"We have always regarded our rights in every respect to have been secure. So well founded has been our belief until we regard that legislation, known as civil rights laws, which has been enacted in other states, to be unnecessary.\\" The trial court dismissed the case as groundless, but Stewart appealed. The Oregon Supreme Court agreed with Stewart, and awarded Taylor a favorable judgment. The successful case did not result in a boom in business, and Stewart continued to struggle financially. To try to broaden his income, he purchased stock in a number of companies, but none were successful. Stewart continued to participate in efforts to improve the black community in Portland, helping found The Advocate, Portland's second oldest black newspaper. When his own law office burned down in 1908, that newspaper allowed him to use their offices until his building was restored. A 1907 case highlighted the racism that a black attorney garnered from the white press: a white woman accused Stewart's black client of defamation after alleging he propositioned her on the street. His client was called racial slurs in the press, which also described his cross- examination as \\"subject(ing) [the accuser] to the humiliating questions of a black lawyer who defended the black act of his black client in a black way, viz, by again insulting the [white] girl.\\" Stewart did not shy away from speaking out against the oppression of blacks in the South as well as the lynchings taking place throughout the country. In 1914, he publicly criticized President Woodrow Wilson's failure to halt lynchings. Stewart's life was seriously affected by physical problems. On April 22, 1909, Stewart was in a streetcar accident: he slipped while running to board which caused his leg to be mangled severely, necessitating the amputation of his left leg below the knee.Minneapolis., The Appeal, April 22, 1909, accessed January 22, 2011. He began using a prosthetic leg made out of cork. His vision then began to fail, causing him to fear he might lose his sight. These issues caused him to rely on charity for a brief period, but he then resumed practice to support his family. A 1910 photo of Stewart, his wife, sister-in-law and daughter. In September 1911, while walking home from a banquet, Stewart stopped at a restaurant to greet some friends inside. As he stood in the doorway, a Portland Police officer ordered him to move on and threatened to arrest him if he refused to comply. Believing he had done no wrong, Stewart objected and the policeman arrested him and made him walk a mile on his prosthetic leg to the police station where he was booked for drunkenness. Authorities refused to charge Stewart, and the next day he filed a complaint of assault and battery with the district attorney, who issued an arrest warrant against the officer. At the hearing the officer maintained that Stewart was very inebriated while Stewart produced numerous witnesses from the banquet arguing the opposite. The complaint was dismissed and Stewart appealed to the Mayor of Portland and publicized the incident in The Oregon Journal. Whether there was any further action is unknown. Stewart tried to use his wide number of contacts in the Oregon political and legal community to gain a political appointment, securing letters of recommendation from a number of important members of the legal and ecclesiastical communities. Still an active Republican, his support was solicited by members of the party of all races. However, the small black population kept Stewart from significant success, as he only received a commission as a notary public. Democratic Governor George Earle Chamberlain appointed him as Oregon's representative to the 1908 National Negro Fair in Mobile, Alabama, where he gave a keynote address. He was then appointed by Chamberlain as chief commissioner to the National Emancipation Commemoration Society, organized by President William Howard Taft in 1909. In 1914 he tried to become Portland's public defender, but did not succeed. In 1916, he lobbied the Oregon State Legislature to repeal anachronistic and unenforced sections of the Oregon constitution that denied suffrage and basic property rights to blacks. Despite support from The Oregonian, the effort failed. Stewart's lack of success in Portland led him to move to San Francisco in 1917. He did not find his departure from Portland to be particularly difficult, writing that \\"The business was not there‚ÄîI stuck to it‚Äîlived in debt‚Äîstarved and worried but it was not there.\\" He blamed the economy of the region, though did not explicitly cite the racial prejudices that kept white clients from hiring black lawyers. He had trouble with both races: whites considered him a lawyer of \\"colored people\\" and did nothing to help him, while blacks frequently neglected to pay his fees, which included an instance in 1917 where Stewart had to sue a black church for services rendered in successfully protecting it from a condemnation proceeding. His departure left Portland without an African American attorney. =San Francisco= McCants Stewart and his family in 1919. As he prepared to move to California, Stewart received a number of letters of praise and commendation, as well as references. Among them, Oregon Governor James Withycombe sent a letter to California Governor William Stephens which introduced and praised Stewart. A number of members of the Oregon judiciary also wrote him recommendations. Thus, despite arriving alone and broke, Stewart arrived in California optimistic that he could succeed and soon formed a partnership with Oscar Hudson, a respected black attorney. A few months after moving to San Francisco, Stewart had to return to Oregon to close his office, bring his family to California and finish the appeal of his final Oregon case, Allen v. People's Amusement Co. Just like Taylor eleven years earlier, the case involved a black patron denied seating in the white section of a Portland theater despite his purchase of a general admissions ticket. Before the Oregon Supreme Court, Stewart argued the same theory. Inexplicably, despite the nearly indistinguishable facts, the court ignored Taylor and ruled for the theater's decision to segregate itself. Thus, after his final case in Oregon, the condition of public accommodation of African Americans was no better than when he first arrived. Upon returning to California, Stewart's optimism for San Francisco was short lived: despite the larger black professional class, there was little affluence and even more racial segregation than in Portland. His legal partnership with Hudson struggled financially, but the two remained committed to it. Ultimately, Stewart gave in to pressure.Stewarts, McCants (1877-1919), BlackPast.org, Accessed January 22, 2011. On April 14, 1919, unable to read his morning newspaper and fearing that he was about to go blind, Stewart wrote a note of farewell and shot himself in the head in his office. His body was found the following day by a business associate. His suicide note said: \\"I am going blind. My sight is gone. I can't see to read. Poor Mac. I can't stand it any longer, so I cashed in.\\"McCant Stewart, Cayton's Weekly, April 26, 1919, Accessed January 23, 2011. Legacy Stewart achieved several firsts for African Americans: he was the first to become an Oregon lawyer, the first to argue and the first to win a case before the Oregon Supreme Court, and the first to receive an LL.M. from the University of Minnesota Law School. Although Stewart followed many of Booker T. Washington's philosophies of self-reliance, industriousness and good citizenship, he also differed by actively advocating for civil rights for African Americans in an era when discrimination was high. Despite this difference and his early discipline issues at the Tuskegee Institute, Washington cited Stewart in a letter as a model citizen and \\"a Tuskegee graduate who has a good reputation, stands high in his profession and is succeeding.\\" In 1988, the University of Minnesota Law School awarded a Mary and McCants Stewart Foundation scholarship. During its inauguration, J. Clay Smith, Jr., former dean of the Howard University School of Law, noted that \\"Despite the ominous shadow of segregation, Stewart refused to sacrifice his principles at the expense of his clients or to derogate his beliefs.\\" The respect he gained from his legal colleagues and the judiciary, including former opposing counsel such as those in Taylor, testify to his legal mind and character. Stewart's daughter would marry Robert B. Flippin, a correctional counselor at San Quentin State Prison, reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle and activist with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) as well as other organizations. Mary Katherine Stewart- Flippin donated her family's papers, including those of her grandfather T. McCants Stewart, her father, and her husband to Howard University.MANUSCRIPT COLLECTIONS (S-Z), Moorland-Spingarn Research Center, Howard University, accessed January 24, 2011.

Description The DeKalb County and Boone‚ÄìMcHenry County portions of Coon Creek are different in character. While 72% of the watershed, Coon Creek and its tributaries, has had its stream beds channelized (ditched and straightened) only 42% of the Coon's main stem has been channelized. In McHenry County, Coon Creek still features many of its natural features, such as pools and riffles. In DeKalb County, further away from the Kishwaukee, the stream has been entirely channelized, only 6% of the Coon's tributaries in this area have not been channelized. This portion of Coon Creek retains very few of the natural instream characteristics such as pools or riffles. Wildlife The Coon Creek watershed (technically a subwatershed) is home to at least 34 different species of fish. Some of the species found in Coon Creek include bluegill, black crappie, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass and northern pike. The blacknose shiner (Notropis heteropis) is an example of an endangered fish found in the creek. The creek is also home to two species of reptile, the federally threatened Blanding's turtle (Emydoidea blandingii) and the snapping turtle. Tributaries Coon Creek has several tributaries. Among them are Harmony Creek, Hampshire Creek, and Burlington Creek.

History Made up entirely of nunataks,GEUS Map - Northern East Greenland; Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland Bulletin 21 Map 4 - 1:1 000 000 this remote range was formerly an unknown area. In 1912 Swiss geophysicist and Arctic explorer Alfred De Quervain crossed the Greenland ice cap from Godhavn (Qeqertarsuaq) on the west, to Sermilik Fjord on the eastern side and saw a range system that he named 'Schweizerland', marking the position and approximate height of Mont Forel, the highest point of that areaAlfred de Quervain's Swiss Greenland expeditions, 1909 and 1912 in Polar Record, Cambridge Journals by William Barr Lacking accurate data, Mont Forel was then thought to be the highest mountain in the Arctic Circle area, together with Petermann Peak far to the north.The Development of Mountaineering in East and North-East Greenland, An Outline History However, in 1930 Gino Watkins, leader of the British Arctic Air Route Expedition, discovered a new mountain range from the air located over 350 km to the northeast of SchweizerlandThe Swiss Expedition to Greenland 1938.

This was the higher Watkins Range with the Gunnbj√∏rnsfjeld, the actual highest summit in Greenland.Encyclopedia Arctica 14: Greenland In 1935 Lawrence Wager, who had been earlier with Watkins' 1930 expedition returned to East Greenland and opened a new route inland. During his venture he made the first ascent of the range's highest point, Gunnbjorns Fjeld. He was also able to sight as well the Lemon Range, a hitherto unknown range located to the north-east of Kangerlugssuaq Fjord. Geography The Watkins Range is located in King Christian IX Land about 60 km inland from the Blosseville Coast. It is a system of nunataks surrounded by large active glaciers. The main glaciers are the large Christian IV Glacier to the west, the Rosenborg Glacier to the south and the Kronborg Glacier to the east. The range has massive ice-covered peaks and exposed cliffs. The primary summit of the range is Gunnbj√∏rn Fjeld , also the highest peak in the Arctic. The Lindbergh Range rises to the west, beyond the Christian IV Glacier. Other high nunataks are located nearby, some being part of the greater Watkins Range system, such as the Skaermen (Sk√¶rmen) to the west, the Ejnar Mikkelsen Range‚Äî and the Borgtinderne to the east, and the Lilloise Range to the southeast. The Gronau Nunataks are located to the north at the edge of the Greenland Ice Sheet, separated from the Watkins Range by the Christian IV Glacier.

He represents the Highlanders in the Super Rugby competition and Southland in the ITM Cup, playing at number 8. Dixon is best known for his three test appearances for the All Blacks in 2016. Early life Dixon is of MƒÅori and Scottish Ancestry on his father's side and Irish on his mother's side. He grew up in Christchurch and attended St Bede's College. Playing career =Provincial rugby= Dixon moved through the age group levels for Canterbury, but transferred to Southland in late 2009 for a better chance to play in the provincial competition. He made his provincial debut for Southland during the 2010 ITM Cup, scoring a try on his first appearance in a 37‚Äì23 win over Manawatu. He developed into a key member of the team over the course of the season, sharing playing time at number 8 with veteran Samoan international Kane Thompson. In the 2011 ITM Cup, Dixon appeared in every match for Southland, and helped the team to a Ranfurly Shield victory over Canterbury on 23 July. =Super Rugby= Following his solid season for Southland in 2010, Dixon was included in the Highlanders squad for the 2011 Super Rugby season. It would be a difficult season, however, as he didn't make any appearances for the squad due in large part to an elbow injury which left him unavailable for most of the year. Dixon took over as captain of the Highlanders for many games of the 2017 season due to the loss of co-captains Ash Dixon and Ben Smith to injury. Dixon had already been required to step up due to the large number of other loose forwards that were injured. Dixon missed the Highlanders' famous 23-22 narrow victory over the touring British and Irish Lions that season due to his inclusion in the MƒÅori All Blacks, with future All Black captain Luke Whitelock leading the team, and Gareth Evans starting at flanker in Dixon's place. Dixon lost his place in the starting XV to Whitelock by the end of the season. =International play= Dixon was a key member of the squad that won the Under-20 World Cup in 2009, where he suited up alongside current Southland teammates Robbie Robinson, Brayden Mitchell, and Alex Ryan. The longest drop- goal attempt was attempted by Dixon in the final but landed 50 metres short. On 29 May 2016 he was selected as one of three un-capped loose forwards, alongside Highlanders teammate Liam Squire and Hurricanes flanker Ardie Savea, in the All Blacks' 32-man squad for a three-test series against Wales. Dixon made his debut for New Zealand at blindside flanker on 25 June 2016 in the third test of the Welsh series, being selected to start over then-69-test veteran Jerome Kaino. Dixon performed well and was replaced by Squire, who was also on debut, in the 55th minute, with the All Blacks winning the test 46-6 and ending the series as a 3-0 clean sweep. Dixon was retained for the All Blacks' 33-man squad for the 2016 Rugby Championship. The All Blacks won the competition but it was a personal disappointment for Dixon, who only managed four minutes of game time in the competition, mostly due to the dominance of Savea and Squire as replacements off the bench. Those four minutes came on 1 October 2016 when he replaced All Blacks captain Kieran Read 76 minutes into the All Blacks' 36‚Äì17 over Argentina. Dixon made one more appearance for New Zealand in 2016, playing the full 80 minutes against Italy on 12 November. Dixon scored his first international try against Italy, scoring in the 62nd minutem while also setting up Steven Luatua for his try. Dixon was not selected for the All Blacks for the Pasifika Challenge against Samoa and three-test 2017 British and Irish Lions series. Dixon's omission from the squad was due to the inclusion of Hurricanes flanker Vaea Fifita. Dixon was also named in the MƒÅori All Blacks' squad to face the Lions on the same day. Dixon started at openside flanker for the MƒÅori All Blacks against the Lions on 17 June and was replaced by Kara Pryor in the 72nd minute of their 10‚Äì32 loss to the Lions.

After his conviction, Gosnell waived his right to appeal in exchange for an agreement by prosecutors not to seek the death penalty. He was sentenced instead to life in prison without the possibility of parole.  Background and early career  Kermit Gosnell was born on February 9, 1941, in Philadelphia, the only child of a gas station operator and a government clerk in an African-American family. He was a student at the city's Central High School from which he graduated in 1959. Gosnell initially attended the University of Pennsylvaniahttps://www.inquirer.com/philly/blogs/199777771.html then graduated from Dickinson College in Carlisle, PA with a bachelor's degree.. Gosnell received his medical degree at the Jefferson Medical School in 1966. It has been reported that he spent four decades practicing medicine among the poor, including opening the Mantua Halfway House, a rehab clinic for drug addicts in the impoverished Mantua neighborhood of West Philadelphia near where he grew up, and a teen aid program. He became an early proponent of abortion rights in the 1960s and 1970s and, in 1972, he returned from a stint in New York City to open up an abortion clinic on Lancaster Avenue in Mantua. Gosnell told a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter in October 1972: \\"as a physician, I am very concerned about the sanctity of life. But it is for this precise reason that I provide abortions for women who want and need them\\". In the same year, he also performed fifteen televised second-trimester abortions, using an experimental \\"Super Coil\\" method invented by Harvey Karman. The coils were inserted into the uterus, where they caused irritation leading to the expulsion of the fetus. However, complications from the procedure were reported by nine of the women, with three of these reporting severe complications. The 1972 Inquirer article also said that Gosnell was a \\"respected man\\" in his community, a finalist for the Junior Chamber of Commerce's \\"Young Philadelphian of the Year\\" because of his work directing the Mantua Halfway House. By the late 1980s, however, public records showed state tax liens were piling up against the halfway house, and the abortion clinic had a $41,000 federal tax lien. Gosnell has been married three times. His third and current wife, Pearl, had worked at the Women's Medical Society as a full-time medical assistant from 1982 until their marriage in 1990. They have two children; the younger, being a minor, is being cared for by friends. Gosnell has four other children from his two previous marriages. In covering his background, media commentators drew attention to the \\"incredibly diverse\\" portrayals of Gosnell, touching on both his community works ‚Äì the creation of a drugs halfway house and teen aid program ‚Äì contrasted with portrayals of his practice as an abortion mill in which viable fetuses and babies were routinely killed following illegal late-term procedures. Medical practice In 2011, he was reported to be well-known in Philadelphia for providing abortions to poor minority and immigrant women. It was also claimed that Gosnell charged $1,600‚Äì$3,000 for each late-term abortion, and made $10,000-$15,000 per day from the clinic.Kermit Gosnell: Abortion doctor murdered for money (Other Views) - The Middletown Press Gosnell was also associated with clinics in Delaware and Louisiana. Atlantic Women's Services in Wilmington, Delaware, was Gosnell's place of work one day a week. The owner of Atlantic Women's Services, Leroy Brinkley, also owned Delta Clinic of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and facilitated the hiring of staff from there for Gosnell's operation in Philadelphia.  Legal case  =Known prior complaints= * 1989 and 1993 ‚Äì cited by Pennsylvania Department of Health for having no nurses in the recovery room. * 1996 ‚Äì censured and fined in both Pennsylvania and New York states, for employing unlicensed personnel. * Around 1996 ‚Äì Pediatrician Dr Schwartz ‚Äì the former head of adolescent services at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and , Philadelphia's health commissioner ‚Äì testified in the 2010 hearing that around 1996 or 1997, he had hand-delivered a letter of complaint about Gosnell's practice to the Secretary of Health's office and stopped referring patients to the clinic, but received no response. * 2000 ‚Äì Civil lawsuit filed on behalf of the children of Semika Shaw, who had called the clinic the day after an abortion to report heavy bleeding, and died 3 days later of a perforated uterus and a bloodstream infection. The case alleged that Gosnell had failed to tell her to return to the clinic or seek emergency medical care. It was settled out of court in 2002 for $900,000.. * Around 2001 ‚Äì Gosnell claimed to be providing children's vaccines under a program administered by the Health Department's Division of Disease Control, but was repeatedly suspended for failing to maintain logs and for storing vaccines in unsanitary and inappropriate refrigerators, and at improper temperatures. * December 2001 ‚Äì ex-employee Marcella Choung gave what the Grand Jury would later call \\"a detailed written complaint\\" to the Pennsylvania Department of State, one which she followed up with an interview in March 2002. * 2006 ‚Äì Civil lawsuit filed by patient but dismissed as out of time. The complaint was that Gosnell had been unable to complete an abortion, but then apparently failed or refused to call paramedics or other clinical emergency personnel, after the patient had needed help. The patient reported, \\"I really felt like he was going to let me die.\\" In total during the course of his career, 46 known lawsuits had been filed against Gosnell over some 32 years. Observers claimed that there was a complete failure by Pennsylvania regulators who had overlooked other repeated concerns brought to their attention, including lack of trained staff, \\"barbaric\\" conditions, and a high level of illegal late-term abortions. = 2010 raid = The Women's Medical Society was raided on February 18, 2010, under a search warrant by investigators from the FBI and state police. The raid was the result of a months-long investigation by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Philadelphia Police Department, and the state's Dangerous Drug-Offender Unit into suspected illegal drug prescription use at the practice. The investigation had also revealed the suspicious death of patient Karnamaya Mongar in 2009, which had in turn brought to light further information about unsanitary operations, use of untrained staff, and use of powerful drugs without proper medical supervision and control. Thus, when the February 2010 raid took place, staff from the Pennsylvania Department of State and Pennsylvania Department of Health also attended, as these issues were under their remit: Gosnell's license to practice was suspended on February 22, 2010, and these and other findings were presented to a grand jury on May 4, 2010. Public discussion focused on claims of unsanitary conditions and other unacceptable conditions at the practices. Media reports stated that furniture and blankets were stained with blood, that freely roaming cats defecated wherever they pleased, and that non-sterilized equipment was used and reused on patients.. According to the grand jury report, patients were given labor-inducing drugs by staff who had no medical training. Once labor began, the patient would be placed on a toilet. After the fetus fell into the toilet, it would be fished out, so as not to clog the plumbing. In the recovery room, patients were seated on dirty recliners covered in blood-stained blankets.. Prosecutors alleged that Gosnell had not been certified in either gynecology or obstetrics. The grand jury estimated that Gosnell's practice \\"took in $10,000 to $15,000 a night\\" of additional income from his exceedingly high level of prescriptions. = 2011 arrest = Gosnell was arrested on January 19, 2011, five days after the certification of the grand jury's report. He was charged with eight counts of murder. Prosecutors alleged that he killed seven babies born alive by severing their spinal cords with scissors, and that he was also responsible for the death in 2009 of Karnamaya Mongar, a 41-year-old refugee from Bhutan, who died in his care. Gosnell's wife, Pearl, and eight other suspects were also arrested in connection with the case. The Drug Enforcement Administration, The Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Office of the Inspector General also sought a 23-count indictment charging Gosnell and seven members of his former staff with drug conspiracy, relating to the practice's illegally prescribing highly- addictive painkillers and sedatives outside the usual course of professional practice and not for a legitimate medical purpose. * The third-degree murder charge relates to Karnamaya Mongar; according to prosecutors, Gosnell's staff gave the 90-pound woman a lethal dose of anesthesia and painkillers. * The seven other murder charges are all of first-degree murder; they relate to babies, whom staff have testified they saw move or cry after complete birth, and whose deaths are alleged to have resulted from subsequent lethal action. They arise because of the \\"born alive rule\\", a principle of common law which stipulates that by default, for legal purposes, personhood arises ‚Äì and therefore unlawful killing constituting murder becomes possible ‚Äì immediately upon the victim's being born alive (several US states as well as Federal legislation have more specific laws to protect fetuses and newborn babies; see fetal rights and born alive laws in the United States). Steven Massof, a clinic employee who pleaded guilty to similar charges in 2011, testified that he (Massof) had snipped the spines of more than 100 infants after they had been born alive, and that this was considered \\"standard procedure\\" at the clinic; a number of other employees had also testified to the same point.. No physical evidence exists for five of the seven cases ‚Äì charges are based on staff testimony and denied by Gosnell. A photograph exists of the sixth, who allegedly had a gestational age of 30 weeks, and the physical remains were obtained of the seventh. The grand jury report states that \\"A medical expert with 43 years of experience in performing abortions was appalled. This expert told us, 'I've never heard of it [cutting the spinal cord] being done during an abortion'.\\" The United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania also alleges that Gosnell's former office staff at Family and Women's Medical Society (WMS) ran a prescription \\"pill mill\\". From June 2008 through February 18, 2010, Gosnell allegedly engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise by writing and dispensing fraudulent prescriptions for thousands of pills of the frequently abused tablets OxyContin, Percocet, and Xanax, and the frequently abused syrups Phenergan and Promethazine with codeine. Authorities further allege that Gosnell and his staff allowed customers to purchase multiple prescriptions under multiple names. For the first office visit, Gosnell allegedly charged $115, but around December 2009 he allegedly increased the initial office visit fee to $150. Staff at the clinic went from writing several hundred prescriptions for controlled substances per month filled at pharmacies in 2008 to over 2,300 filled at pharmacies in January 2010. Gosnell, with the assistance of his staff, is said to have distributed and dispensed more than 500,000 pills containing oxycodone; more than 400,000 pills containing alprazolam; and more than 19,000 ounces of cough syrup containing codeine. Gosnell's lawyer stated that \\"Everybody's made him the butcher, this, that and the other thing without any trial, without anything being exposed to the public and everybody's found him guilty, that's not right\\". He accused the government of a \\"lynching\\" and stated, \\"This is a targeted, elitist and racist prosecution of a doctor who's done nothing but give (back) to the poor and the people of West Philadelphia.\\" Following his arrest, Gosnell claimed \\"I'm very close to being destitute\\". However, records showed that he and his wife owned at least 17 properties in four states, including a million dollar house in Brigantine.https://6abc.com/archive/7940035/ = Cases cited in the media = Examples of cases cited in the media include: * Girl age 15, accompanied by relative (1998): said to have told Gosnell she changed her mind about the abortion once inside the practice. Gosnell allegedly got upset, ripped off the patient's clothing, and forcibly restrained her. The patient later stated that Gosnell told her \\"This is the same care that I would give to my own daughter.\\" She regained consciousness 12 hours later at her aunt's home, the abortion having been completed against her will. * Woman age 28, five months pregnant (2001): Patient described the pain four days after abortion as being so bad she could barely walk. The patient described that upon returning to the clinic because of the pain, ultrasound showed fetal remains left inside her uterus, and that Gosnell suctioned these out without anesthesia. \\"I was just laying on the table and crying and I just asked the Lord to get me through it.\\" * Fifteen-year-old (undated): damages awarded in court upon a finding that Gosnell performed an abortion on a fifteen-year-old without parental permission. * Karnamaya Mongar, a 41-year-old refugee from Bhutan (2009): according to prosecutors, Gosnell's staff gave the 90-pound woman a lethal dose of anesthesia and painkillers during a 2009 abortion (this is the adult whose death is charged as third degree murder). During Gosnell's trial, a toxicologist testified to unsafe levels of the drug, and the chair of Anesthesiology at the University of Pittsburgh Medical School testified that the dose received by her was \\"outrageous\\" and \\"most\\" average adults would have stopped breathing if dosed in the manner described. Gosnell's lawyer asserts that Karnamaya Mongar also had other drugs in her system that did not come from Gosnell's clinic, and that none of the infants were born alive. The claim was rejected by the grand jury, based upon expert testimony that \\"it was the overdose of Demerol, not some mystery pill, that killed Mrs. Mongar.\\" = Lack of government oversight = Reports state that state officials had failed to visit or inspect Gosnell's practices since 1993. The grand jury report noted that the medical examiner of Delaware County alerted the Pennsylvania Department of Health that Gosnell had performed an illegal abortion on a 14-year-old who was thirty weeks pregnant;. it is also claimed the Pennsylvania Department of Health did not act when they became aware of Gosnell's involvement in the death of Karnamaya Mongar. Brenda Green, executive director of CHOICE, a nonprofit that connects the underinsured and uninsured with health services, told Katha Pollitt of The Nation that \\"it tried to report complaints from clients, but the department wouldn't accept them from a third party. Instead, the patients had to fill out a daunting five-page form, available only in English, that required them to reveal their identities upfront and be available to testify in Harrisburg. Even with CHOICE staffers there to help, only two women agreed to fill out the form, and both decided not to submit it. The Department of State and the Philadelphia Public Health Department also had ample warning of dire conditions and took no action.\\" In 2011, it was reported that none of Pennsylvania's 22 abortion clinics had been inspected by the government for more than 15 years.. Inspections (other than those triggered by complaints) had ceased under Ridge's governorship, as they were perceived to create a barrier to women seeking abortion services. = Grand jury report = The grand jury published its 280-page report in January 2011. It stated that, while some might see the issue and case through the lens of pro- and anti-abortion politics, it was in reality: The grand jury concluded that the practice was a corrupt organization within the meaning of racketeering law, based upon what it considered evidence of deliberate \\"standard\\" use of \\"bogus\\" doctors, falsification of records, grossly unprofessional procedures with little or no regard for human life, and flagrant disregard for medical and abortion laws and their consequences. Key findings included: Practice conditions and procedures * Extreme unsanitary conditions (resulting in cases of STDs and sepsis); pervasive non- sterile conditions; blood-stained materials and instruments; contamination of the facilities by animal feces, urine, and other noxious fluids and waste; and months-old fetal remains stored in \\"jars, bags and jugs\\" (in 2013 the trial heard that Gosnell had also been in dispute with his medical waste company, with the latter stopping their services); * Surgical malpractice including perforation of bodily organs and \\"on at least two occasions\\" death; * Improper equipment and usage, including repeated reuse (\\"over and over\\") of disposable supplies, and \\"generally broken\\" life-saving and monitoring equipment (including blood pressure monitoring, oximeters, and defibrillators); * Padlocked emergency access and exit routes; * Lack of properly trained staff, \\"bogus doctors\\" ‚Äî unqualified, unlicensed and unsupervised staff who misrepresented themselves to patients as qualified licensed clinicians ‚Äî and no qualified nurses. The jury reported that \\"Most of Gosnell's employees who worked with patients had little or no remotely relevant training or education\\" (ex-employee Marcella Choung, who in 2001 and at interview in 2002 gave a detailed written complaint to the Pennsylvania Department of State, testified that her 'training' for anesthesia consisted of \\"a 15-minute description by Gosnell and reading a chart he had posted in a cabinet.\\") * Gosnell himself was largely absent and left the clinic to be operated by his unqualified employees, whom he sometimes \\"ordered\\" to perform medical actions even if they \\"protested\\" that they were unqualified. Employees testified they had to rely on themselves, as \\"Gosnell disliked it when workers disturbed him by calling for medication advice\\"; * Operation of a \\"prescription treadmill\\" whereby blank signed prescriptions would be left for those seeking controlled medications, unsupervised and uncontrolled by a practitioner (which was the subject of a parallel and separate Federal investigation); * Willful non- compliance with laws intended to safeguard vulnerable women, including non- compliance with requirements for mandatory counseling, consent (for minors), waiting periods (between visiting and surgery); * Fraudulent temporary employment of a nurse for four days during an NAF inspection, with the aim of deceiving the inspectors into believing that his practice staff included a licensed registered nurse (which it did not); over the few days of their on- site review, the nurse resigned upon realizing the fraud, which also involved Gosnell taking her paycheck back afterwards and paying her in cash instead; * Fraudulent recording of gestational age and training of staff to manipulate ultrasound in a way that would match the stated number of weeks; * Dishonest statements by Gosnell and employees to investigators, including claims that Ms. Mongar's death was due to her own action (discredited forensically), falsification and destruction of records, and lying about the manner of her death and Gosnell's (lack of) presence for anesthesia; * Patients given labor- and delivery-inducing drugs during the day, then left waiting until late evening for Gosnell to attend or for surgery. Many gave birth during the day as a result, and employees testified \\"it was standard procedure for women to deliver fetuses ‚Äì and viable babies ‚Äì into toilets\\" while waiting for his arrival. * Practice staff routinely delivered living babies in the third trimester, subsequently killing them (or ensuring their death). As part of this, fetuses and babies had their demise \\"ensured\\" post-operatively by severing of the spinal cord with scissors, known by staff as \\"snipping\\". Most of these were deemed infeasible to prosecute because files and other evidence were not held, although the report stipulates they numbered in the \\"hundreds\\". Among the \\"few cases\\" where tangible evidence existed, the jury noted a boy aged 30 weeks at 6 pounds; a frozen body in a water container of \\"at least\\" 28 weeks; remains of at least one abortion of over 32 weeks for which an extra $1000 had been demanded; testimony of a baby heard to make noise; and a baby left \\"moving and breathing for at least 20 minutes\\" prior to \\"snipping\\". The jury heard testimony about \\"special\\" Sunday sessions, at which only Gosnell and his wife were present, which the jury suspected (and in some cases was able to corroborate) would include cases that were more advanced in time, or more disturbing; * Over time, Gosnell and his practice acquired a \\"bad reputation\\" and during the decade 2000‚Äì09, local community organizations ceased referring patients there. To compensate, the practice took on referrals from other in-state cities; it became understood that Gosnell's center would perform abortions \\"at any stage, without regard for legal limits\\"; * Where induced labor failed, Dr Gosnell would attempt to abort surgically, \\"often calamitous[ly]\\" for the woman involved. Example outcomes included: ** Woman \\"left lying in place for hours after Gosnell tore her cervix and colon\\"; relatives called police after entrance refused, remedial colon surgery required. ** Woman sent home with fetal remains unremoved, \\"serious infection\\" led to near death. ** Punctured uterus leading to shock from blood loss and hysterectomy; woman \\"held for hours\\" by the practice. ** Patient suffered \\"convulsions\\" and fell off the operating table, sustaining a head injury; Gosnell \\"wouldn't call an ambulance, and wouldn't let the woman's companion leave the building so that he could call an ambulance\\". ** Sedation used to mute sounds of pain; Gosnell specified pre-set amounts of drugs for non- physician staff to use on patients, but without reference to individual needs, and without records or monitoring of condition. On numerous occasions, the same patient was dosed multiple times in quick succession by different employees; ** Death of Karnamaya Mongar, who received \\"repeated unmonitored, unrecorded intravenous injections of Demerol\\" (meperidine hydrochloride, an opioid analgesic which the report describes practice staff using as a cheap but dangerous sedative), and ceased breathing. Staff were unable to revive her (emergency medications were not used and the defibrillator was not working), and paramedics were unable to revive her after gaining access, in part because they were deceived by staff as to what had happened and the drugs and dosages responsible. Government and third-party handling * Gosnell's practice was \\"caught by accident\\" during a raid for illegal drugs prescribing. State officials had been invited to attend the raid as well, since preparations for the drugs raid had revealed prior reports and information suggesting grossly substandard practice conditions at the clinic; * Pennsylvania Department of Health failed to regulate properly and failed to ensure that the issues noticed were addressed on the few occasions around 1990 that Gosnell was inspected; and ceased inspections \\"for political reasons\\" (to reduce a perceived deterrent) at the time Tom Ridge took office as Governor of the State; * Inspections were still to continue if complaints were received, yet repeated complaints did not trigger an investigation; the department's response came after media exposure; * The Department of State's Board of Medicine, which licenses and oversees physicians, had \\"more damning information than anyone else\\", including a description of the practice by an ex-employee (Choung) a decade previously (2001 and again 2002), as well as knowledge of at least one of the serious incidents cited of surgical malpractice, but took verbal assurances from Gosnell and no other effective or substantial investigative action was taken over these; * Department of Public Health employees \\"regularly\\" visited the practice but had not adequately reported the issues present. One inspection confirmed \\"numerous violations of protocols for storage and disposal of infectious waste\\" but no follow-up occurred; * A \\"health department representative\\" visiting for a vaccination program in 2009 \\"discovered that Gosnell was scamming the program\\" and \\"was able to file detailed reports identifying many of the most egregious elements of Gosnell's practice\\". Her attempts to raise concerns were ignored; the grand jury report states \\"her reports went into a black hole\\"; * Other third parties had knowledge, but took no visible action. These included the pediatrician and subsequent head of the city's health department, Dr Schwartz, who, around 1996‚Äì97, reported concerns about the practice, concerns on which no action was taken, and who did not himself act after being promoted; University of Pennsylvania hospital and Penn Presbyterian Medical Center who treated numerous surgical failures from Gosnell's practice, including a \\"flagrantly illegal abortion\\", but reported only one of them; the National Abortion Federation whose evaluator around 2009 noted \\"records were not properly kept, that risks were not explained, that patients were not monitored, that equipment was not available, that anesthesia was misused\\" and concluded \\"[i]t was the worst abortion clinic she had ever inspected\\", but no report was made of this to any official body; Culpability The report divided offenses by Gosnell and other practice employees into three categories: \\"charges arising from the baby murders and illegal abortions; charges in connection with the death of Karnamaya Mongar; and charges stemming generally from the ongoing operation of a criminal enterprise\\". The charges recommended were: * Gosnell, Williams, Moton, and Massof ‚Äì charged with first-degree murder for the post-operative killings where evidence existed that the baby was born alive * Gosnell, Williams, Moton, Massof, and West ‚Äì charged with conspiracy to commit murder in relation to \\"hundreds of unidentifiable instances\\" of post-operative killings (called \\"snipping\\" by staff). The jury also recommended charges of solicitation to commit murder by Gosnell. * Gosnell and (as co-conspirators) Williams, West, and Gosnell's wife ‚Äì charged with various violations of the Abortion Control Act, including infanticide and illegal late-term abortions; * Gosnell, Williams, and West ‚Äì charged with third-degree murder (Pennsylvania's equivalent to reckless or voluntary manslaughter), drug delivery resulting in death, violations of the Controlled Substances Act and conspiracy in regard to the death of Karnamaya Mongar. The report states: \\"Gosnell's contempt for the law and his patients cost Karnamaya Mongar her life. Her death was the direct result of deliberate and dangerous conduct by Gosnell and his staff.\\" * Gosnell, West, and Hampton ‚Äì charged with hindering apprehension, and lying to the police, medical practitioners, and the grand jury about the circumstances of Mongar's death (Hampton was also charged with perjury in the same matter); * Gosnell ‚Äì recommended to be charged with abuse of corpses, in regards to the \\"mutilat[ion of] babies and fetuses by cutting off their feet\\" and the \\"bizarre\\" storage of parts of fetal bodies in around 30 jars and other containers at his practice; his explanation that this was done for possible paternity cases was \\"rejected out of hand\\". * The grand jury also concluded that \\"Illegality was so integral to the operation of the Women's Medical Society that the business itself was a corrupt organization\\" (18 Pa.C.S. ¬ß 911, \\"based on a pattern of racketeering activity\\"): ** Gosnell, Williams, West, Moton, Joe, Baldwin, Gosnell's wife, Massof, and O'Neill ‚Äì charged with running that organization or conspiring to do so; ** Massof and O'Neill ‚Äì charged with theft by deception for pretending to be doctors, and billing for their services as if they were licensed physicians, and (with Gosnell) conspiracy to this effect; ** Gosnell ‚Äì charged with obstruction and tampering with evidence, for altering his patient files to hide illegality and for destroying or removing other files entirely; ** Gosnell and Baldwin ‚Äì charged with corrupting the morals of a minor, by hiring her 15-year-old daughter as a staff member, who was \\"required to work 50-hour weeks, starting after school until past midnight, during which she was exposed to the full horrors of Gosnell's practice\\". * Of Gosnell himself, the report concluded, The report also examined the failings of official parties, and the key findings, analyzed in two categories: Recommendations * The Department of Health should explicitly regulate and annually inspect abortion practices, and examine patient files, licenses, and equipment on-site; * Second-trimester abortions should be performed or supervised by doctors who are board-certified in obstetrics and gynecology; * The Department of State \\"must repair its review process\\", including easier reporting, confidentiality, post- investigation response, with cases automatically checked against past records, malpractice databases, and full past history; * Reports about individual doctors checked against reports of medical offices where they worked, and vice versa; * The Department of Public Health \\"should do at least as much to control infectious medical waste as it does to inspect swimming pools\\"; * The conclusions finished by examining the extent to which legislation had been inadequate, and the scope for legislative change, concluding that: = Trial = In 2011, Gosnell, his wife Pearl, and eight other clinic employees were charged in the case. Eight, including Gosnell's wife, subsequently pleaded guilty, most of whom would testify against Gosnell, and three of these pleaded guilty to third-degree murder, carrying a 20- to 40-year term. A gag order was imposed on both defense and prosecution in April 2011, to bar them from talking to the media before the trial.. In December 2011 Pearl Gosnell pleaded guilty to performing illegal abortions, conspiracy, criminal conspiracy and corrupt organization; due to spousal privilege, she would not have to testify against Gosnell, although she could still go to prison. She had testified to the grand jury that she alone assisted on Sundays, and that her role was to \\"help do the instruments\\" in the procedure room and to monitor patients in the recovery room. Another employee testified that she assisted with late-term abortions \\"on Sundays or days we were closed [to] do special cases.\\" As a result, the only employee on trial with Gosnell was Eileen O'Neill, who allegedly held herself out as a doctor at the clinic when she was not licensed. Her lawyer told jurors she never did so, and performed medical duties only under Gosnell's orders. On March 18, 2013, opening statements were given in a Philadelphia court. On April 23, after the prosecution had rested its case, the judge dismissed three of the seven first-degree murder charges (the next day the judge reinstated charges related to one and dismissed another, explaining the wrong charge had been mistakenly dismissed), the one count of infanticide, and all five charges of abusing a corpse Gosnell had been charged with, as well as six of the nine charges of theft by deception faced by O'Neill. No formal ruling has yet been given for these dismissals. Media sources following the trial have suggested that there may have been insufficient evidence of post-procedure life to sustain charges in law. Although prosecutors had argued the movements were voluntary and therefore signs of life, it was argued that the evidence offered by prosecutors was equally capable of being interpreted in some or all of these as single autonomous post-mortem motor movements or spasms instead of clinical signs of life, and additionally that none of the seven were capable of being alive as all had been previously killed clinically in utero by means of drugs as part of the procedure. Also, although staff had used descriptions such as \\"jumping\\" and \\"screaming\\" in their testimony, Gosnell's defense noted that testimony had shown only single movements or breaths, stating that the testimony was not evidence of \\"the movements of a live child\\", and the medical examiner had also testified that tests could not determine whether or not any of the 47 fetuses found had been born alive due to tissue deterioration. The remaining four first-degree murder charges could still have led to the death penalty. The third-degree murder charges in the death of Karnamaya Mongar, the racketeering charge, and over 200 charges related to multiple violations of abortion law were also left standing.. Gosnell's defense attorney rested his case summarily without calling or questioning any witnesses, and without Gosnell taking the stand in his defense, leaving the defense case until final arguments (under US law, a defendant may choose not to take the stand; if so then the jury is instructed that no inference or assumption may be drawn from this). O'Neill also did not testify in her defense. The case went to jury deliberation on April 30, 2013. Defendants, related charges, verdicts and sentencing Gosnell was charged with seven counts of first-degree murder (reduced to four counts at trial) and one count of third-degree murder, as well as infanticide (dismissed at trial), five counts of abusing a corpse (all dismissed at trial), multiple counts of conspiracy, criminal solicitation and violation of a state law that forbids abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy.. The non- murder charges included 24 counts of violating Pennsylvania's Abortion Act by performing illegal third-trimester abortions, 227 counts of violating a 24-hour waiting-period requirement, failing to counsel patients, and racketeering. His co-defendants were: * Pearl Mabel Gosnellhttps://www.dos.pa.gov/ProfessionalLicensing/VerifyaProfessional/DisciplinaryActions/Documents/2012/March%202012.pdf, Kermit's wife, was charged with abortion at 24 or more weeks, conspiracy and participating in a corrupt organization. She pleaded guilty to these charges on December 13, 2011... Pearl Gosnell was sentenced to 7 to 23 months in prison. * Eileen O'Neill of Phoenixville, was convicted of conspiracy charges and theft by deception. She was sentenced to 6-23 months of house arrest, 2 years of probation and 100 hours of community service. * Steven Massof, a medical school graduate who lacked a license, pleaded guilty in November 2011 to two counts of third-degree murder for the deaths of two babies who had been born alive.. * Kareema Cross, who testified at the state trial she had seen at least ten babies breathe after being aborted who were then killed, pleaded guilty to federal drug charges over improper distribution of pain medicine from Gosnell's clinic.. * Adrienne Moton plead guilty to third degree murder, admitting to cutting the neck of ten babies and to racketeering charges. She was sentenced to 11 and a half to 23 months in prison. * Lynda Williams was convicted of two counts of third-degree murder and sentenced to 5 to 10 years for her crimes. * Sherry West was convicted of third-degree murder and other charges, having admitted to administering the overdose that killed Karnamaya Mongar. She was sentenced to 5 to 10 years in prison. * Madeline Joe, of Philadelphia, the clinic's office manager, pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges. * Elizabeth Hampton, Gosnell's sister-in-law, admitted charges of perjury. She was sentenced to one year of probation. * Tina Baldwin pleaded guilty to racketeering, conspiracy and corruption of a minor. She was sentenced to 30 months probation. On May 13, 2013, the jury reported that they were deadlocked on two counts. After returning to deliberations, the jury convicted Gosnell of three counts of murder, one count of involuntary manslaughter, and over 200 lesser counts including infanticide and racketeering.Abortion Doctor Kermit Gosnell Found Guilty  US News  Sky News He was found not guilty on one of the counts of murder. The murder charges Gosnell was convicted of concerned babies referred to as Baby Boy A (also known as Baby Abrams and as Adam), Baby C and Baby D. On May 14, 2013, Gosnell struck a deal with prosecutors in which he agreed to waive all his appeal rights regarding his conviction on the day earlier. In exchange, prosecutors allowed Gosnell to be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. On May 15, 2013, Gosnell was sentenced to three life terms. Drug distribution trial In December 2013 Gosnell was convicted of illegally distributing painkillers. He was charged with illegally distributing a \\"staggering\\" amount of painkillers such as Oxycontin, totalling hundreds of thousands of pills. Many of the drugs he distributed were later sold on the streets by drug dealers. Gosnell was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment for the crimes.Dr. Kermit Gosnell, Pa. abortion doctor, gets 30 years for illegal drugs - CBS News  Impact and aftermath  = Other bodies and persons claiming to have made reports = In April 2011 the University of Pennsylvania Health System claimed as early as 1999 that they had provided to authorities reports about botched procedures by Gosnell. The only case for which any reports were produced was that of Semika Shaw, a 22-year-old, who died at the University of Pennsylvania hospital as a result of bleeding and sepsis caused by a botched procedure by Gosnell. Gosnell's insurers settled a lawsuit with family members of Shaw for $900,000. The health system also claims other undocumented reports were made orally, for which they did not have records.. =Regulatory and legislative impact= The Consumer Protection and Professional Licensure Committee of the Pennsylvania State Senate, led by Robert M. Tomlinson, began a hearing in February 2011 to look into the failure of the Pennsylvania Department of State ‚Äî which is responsible for licensing doctors ‚Äî to provide any oversight of Gosnell's activities. At the same time, the Public Health and Welfare Committee of the state Senate, chaired by Pat Vance, conducted hearings on the Pennsylvania State Health Department's failure to put a stop to Gosnell's activities.. In part as a result of the grand jury report on Gosnell, in late 2011, Pennsylvania passed a law, SB 732, that places abortion clinics under the same health and safety regulations as other outpatient surgical centers. Among those who supported the bill was Democrat Margo L. Davidson, whose cousin Semika Shaw died as a result of procedures done by Gosnell... Davidson specifically linked her support for the additional regulations to her cousin's death, which she attributed to poor medical practices.. In May 2013, as a result of the Kermit Gosnell case, Representative Joe Pitts (R-Pennsylvania), chair of the health-matters subcommittee of the United States House of Representatives' Energy and Commerce Committee, began an inquiry into states' oversight of abortion clinics. In June 2013, the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives passed the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. Speaker of the House John Boehner said the bill was in response to Gosnell's convictions. The legislation was viewed as mostly symbolic, as it stood little chance of being approved by the Democratic-led U.S. Senate. = Non-legislative actions resulting from the case = In February 2011 Pennsylvania Governor and former State Attorney General Tom Corbett fired six employees and commenced action to fire eight others where for legal or contractual reasons, more extensive dismissal procedures were required. These included Basil Merenda, the acting head of the Pennsylvania Department of State, Christine Dutton, the Department of Health's chief counsel (who, in reaction to being questioned why the Department did not react to a death at Gosnell's clinic, said \\"people die\\"), and Stacy Mitchell, a deputy secretary in the health department (whom the grand jury cited as a key figure in the Health Department's indifference to, and non-regulation of, abortion clinics). Some of the people most connected by the grand jury report with the failure of the government to act, such as Janice Staloski, had retired by this point and so no action was taken against them.. = Memorial = The remains of the 47 fetuses and infants found at Gosnell's clinic were buried at Laurel Hill Cemetery, though no headstone was used. In 2019, John and Loida McKeever installed a small memorial at the site, a statue of a angel. A sign around its neck reads: \\"In memory of the babies that were lost at 3801 Lancaster Avenue\\".Kermit Gosnell‚Äôs West Philly ‚Äòhouse of horrors‚Äô could be bought by anti-abortion group  Local News  phillytrib.com Civil cases The family of Karnamaya Mongar brought a wrongful death suit against Gosnell and sought to freeze his assets to prevent him from transferring them to other people to avoid paying. In September 2015, a judge in Philadelphia Common Pleas court awarded nearly $4 million in compensatory damages to Mongar's daughter, Yashoda Devi Gurung. However, reports that Gosnell had few assets by this time made it doubtful whether any of the money would be paid. Media coverage and public reactions Gosnell's arrest has been the subject of much public comment and expressions of condemnation and shock by senior public figures of all parties. Mayor Michael Nutter (D-PA) said, \\"I think it's quite clear that, if these allegations are true, we've had a monster living in our midst\\" while vowing to watch the city's remaining abortion clinics more closely. Outgoing Governor Ed Rendell (D-PA) criticized Department of Health officials saying, \\"I was flabbergasted to learn that the Department of Health did not think their authority to protect public health extended to clinics offering abortion services\\", while incoming Governor Tom Corbett (R-PA) stated through a spokesperson that he was \\"appalled at the inaction on the part of the Health Department and the Department of State,\\" and District Attorney of the city of Philadelphia R. Seth Williams said \\"My comprehension of the English language can't adequately describe the barbaric nature of Dr. Gosnell... Pennsylvania is not a third- world country... There were several oversight agencies that stumbled upon and should have shut down Kermit Gosnell long ago.\\". Gosnell also practiced in other states, including Delaware. In January 2011, Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden (D-Delaware) promised a wide-ranging investigations into the abortions Gosnell performed in Delaware saying; \\"I'm disturbed by the allegations that were handed up by the grand jury in Philadelphia\\". A spokesperson for the National Abortion Federation, an association of abortion providers, noted that Gosnell had been rejected for membership following inspection, because his clinics did not meet appropriate standards of care, but that \\"they'd cleaned the place up and hired an RN [registered nurse] for our visit. We only saw first-trimester procedures.\\" She adding that \\"Unfortunately, some women don't know where to turn. You sometimes have substandard providers preying on low-income women who don't know that they do have other (safe) options.\\" A spokesperson for Planned Parenthood in Southeastern Pennsylvania, condemned Gosnell, saying, \\"We would condemn any physician who does not follow the law or endangers anyone's health... All women should have access to high-quality care when they are vulnerable and facing difficult decisions.\\" Dayle Steinberg, CEO of Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania, says she knew that Gosnell had provided abortions in Philadelphia for many years, but says she hadn't heard of any problems at his clinic until the allegations surfaced. She has been quoted as stating that \\"when Gosnell was in practice, women would sometimes come to Planned Parenthood for services after first visiting Gosnell's West Philadelphia clinic, and would complain to staff about the conditions there. We would always encourage them to report it to the Department of Health.\\" She clarified that \\"when Gosnell was arrested, I asked our staff if anyone had ever heard of him, and clinic staff members reported that a few women over the years said they were concerned about the uncleanliness of his facility and came to Planned Parenthood instead... if we had heard anything remotely like the conditions that have since come to light about Gosnell's facility, of course we would have alerted the state and other authorities\\". Kermit Gosnell himself gave an interview to Fox 29 in February 2011, in which he stated that: * \\"I expect to be vindicated.\\" * [Regarding the allegations] \\"to tell you the truth, I hope to read them in 3 to 6 months [...] because I have lived through negative publicity before.\\" * \\"It's something I have personally experienced several times before where my surgical abilities have been challenged, where the choices that I have made have not always been perfect.\\" * \\"If you are not making mistakes, you are not really attempting to do something, so I think that my patients are aware that I do my very best by them.\\" * \\"The standard that I share with everyone that, I frequently say is that I provide the same care that I would provide my own daughter I feel.\\" * \\"I have a story to tell. [...] my work to the community is of value.\\" * Gosnell reported that he received outpouring of support: \\"letters, I have gotten wonderful little messages of support, and confidence that I am a good person will prevail.\\" =Criticism of media coverage= A perception had built up among some journalists and pro-life groups that there had been a reluctance to report on the trial among mainstream media. In an April 11, 2013 opinion column for USA Today, Kirsten Powers wrote: \\"A Lexis-Nexis search shows none of the news shows on the three major national television networks has mentioned the Gosnell trial in the last three months\\", and that national press coverage was represented by a Wall Street Journal columnist who \\"hijacked\\" a segment on Meet the Press, a single page A-17 story on the first day of the trial by The New York Times, and no original coverage by The Washington Post. While Kirsten Powers is credited by some for drawing media coverage to the Gosnell trial, Dave Weigel at Slate.com reported it was conservatives' aggressive use of social media, especially Twitter, that \\"goaded\\" the press into covering the trial in Philadelphia. According to Weigel, Troy Newman, president of the Kansas-based pro-life Operation Rescue, had organized a Twitter campaign using \\"#Gosnell\\" to break the \\"Gosnell Media Blackout.\\" Key to that social media campaign was a picture of rows of empty media seats in the Gosnell courtroom taken by Calkins Media columnist J.D. Mullane. Mullane told Weigel he was struck by the absence of media at the trial, and took out his iPhone and snapped the picture, tweeting it later that night. \\"Mullane retweeted the photo a few more times, with different captions, because it had been packed into a snowball (of criticism)\\" which included Powers' column for USA Today, Weigel wrote. The empty seats photograph was used by pro-life activists to show \\"proof\\" of media dereliction. Weigel wrote: \\"It worked. An estimated 106,000 #Gosnell tweets later, on April 15, Mullane reported that major networks and newspapers had sent their reporters to cover the trial‚ÄîFox News, the New York Times, the Washington Post.\\" Writing for The Washington Post, Melinda Henneberger responded that \\"we didn't write more because the only abortion story most outlets ever cover in the news pages is every single threat or perceived threat to abortion rights. In fact, that is so fixed a view of what constitutes coverage of that issue that it's genuinely hard, I think, for many journalists to see a story outside that paradigm as news. That's not so much a conscious decision as a reflex, but the effect is one- sided coverage\\". Explaining why some of her colleagues did not report on the story, Henneberger wrote, \\"One colleague viewed Gosnell's alleged atrocities as a local crime story, though I can't think of another mass murder, with hundreds of victims, that we ever saw that way. Another said it was just too lurid, though that didn't keep us from covering Jeffrey Dahmer, or that aspiring cannibal at the NYPD.\\" Writing for Bloomberg View, Jeffrey Goldberg said that this story \\"upsets a particular narrative about the reality of certain types of abortion, and that reality isn't something some pro-choice absolutists want to discuss\\". The Los Angeles Times,. The Atlantic, Slate, and Time. all published opinion columns where the writer thought the incident was not getting as much media coverage as it deserved. Megan McArdle explains that she didn't cover it because it made her ill, but also how being pro-choice influenced writers saying \\"most of us tend to be less interested in sick- making stories if the sick-making was done by 'our side,'\\" saying, \\"this story should have been covered much more than it was ‚Äî covered as a national policy issue, not a 'local crime story.'\\" Martin Baron, The Post's executive editor, claims he wasn't aware of the story until Thursday, 11 April, when readers began emailing him about it, saying \\"I wish I could be conscious of all stories everywhere, but I can't be\\". They ultimately decided that, in fact, the story warranted attention because of \\"the seriousness and scope of the alleged crimes and because this was a case that resonated in policy arguments and national politics\\", adding \\"In retrospect, we regret not having staffed the trial sooner. But, as you know, we don't have unlimited resources, and [...] there is a lot of competition for our staff's attention\\". He insisted that \\"we never decide what to cover for ideological reasons, no matter what critics might claim. Accusations of ideological motives are easy to make, even if they're not supported by the facts\\". The New York Times also acknowledged the lack of coverage and reported on the online campaign and subsequent increase in coverage of the case. While Powers' piece clearly sparked debate among journalists, Katherine Bindley also highlights contrasting views, as does Paul Farhi. A column on Salon.com questioned whether the Gosnell case was an example of liberal media bias, saying that conservative media and politicians had also given little attention to the story until April 2013. In April 2013, 71 other Members of Congress joined Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn in a letter condemning the media \\"blackout\\" on the Gosnell trial..

No such bridges have been built, nor are there any specific plans, although the method has been considered for several bridges in Norway. It was developed collaboratively by the Norwegian Public Roads Administration and the civil engineering consulting company Aas-Jakobsen as a means of building bridges with spans between . The design is based on two separate roadways which are connected by crossbeams. A symphony bridge would have two pylons, which would be circular in hollow cross-section. The center of the bridge would be supported by a central cable (unlike the conventional two side cables of a suspension bridge) connected to the deck via hangers connected to the crossbeams. The cross-beams and hangers are triangular in form. On both sides of the suspension section, the bridge would be built as a cable-stayed bridge with cables from the pylon. The areas closest to the pylons would be constructed with cantilever support. The designers have stated that the bridge would allow for greater wind stability, more drag, faster construction time, lower cost, and increased access for inspections and maintenance. For the H√•logaland Bridge, which is proposed to have a long main span, a symphony bridge was considered but was discarded after it was deemed too expensive at a projected cost of 2,380 million Norwegian kroner (NOK), compared to NOK 1,860 for a suspension bridge. The proposed Storfjord Bridge could be built as a symphony bridge.

He was the founder and first conductor of the LA Women's Orchestra in 1893 and of the LA Symphony in 1897. Hamilton was one of the first symphony American directors in those years, when most conductors were born and trained abroad. Hamilton was born in 1861 in Kenwood, New York, to Susan C. Williams and Henry W. Burnham. He was a member of the Oneida Community in New York, which his parents joined in 1848, until the Community dissolved in 1881. Shortly before his mother's death, he was adopted by Erastus Hapgood Hamilton (a leading Community member and architect of the Oneida Community Mansion House; now a Museum), from whom he took his name. He was trained as a violinist and conductor (by Oneida Community member and bandleader Charles Joslyn). He worked as a printer and it is believed that his stepfather sent him to study at the New York College of Music, where he graduated. In 1881, when the Community dissolved, he started traveling as a member of a minstrel group arriving in Los Angeles in 1883. He worked in Los Angeles both as a printer and musician, with several experiences as director and a member of choirs, bands and orchestras. He worked with both amateur and professional orchestras. Hamilton formed the LA Women's Orchestra in 1893 and the LA Symphony in 1897. Both became quite popular and contributed to the development of symphonic music in the Los Angeles area. He resigned from both in 1913, probably due to advancing deafness. He died of apoplexy (stroke) in 1933. He is buried at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Hollywood, California (Find A Grave Reference).

Areas where mangroves occur include the intertidal zone of tropical, subtropical and protected temperate coastal rivers, estuaries, bays and marine shorelines. Less than 1% of Australia's total forest area is mangrove forest. Although mangroves are typically found in tropical and subtropical tidal areas,Mangal (Mangrove). World Vegetation. Mildred E. Mathias Botanical Garden, University of California at Los Angeles there are occurrences as far south as Millers Landing in Wilsons Promontory, Victoria (38¬∞54‚Ä≤S), Barker Inlet in Adelaide, South Australia and Leschenault Inlet (Koombana Park), near Bunbury, Western Australia. Nearly half of Australia's mangrove forests are found in Queensland (44% of Australia's total), followed by the Northern Territory (37%) and Western Australia (17%). In Western Australia, populations of mangroves are scattered down the coast; the population of the Abrolhos Islands is 300 kilometres south of the nearest population of Shark Bay, and the population at Bunbury is even further south than this (500 km). The Bunbury colonisation may have occurred relatively recently, perhaps only several thousand years ago, with propagules transferred by the Leeuwin Current. The most inland occurrence of mangroves in Australia is a stand of grey mangroves in the Mandora Marsh, some 60 km from the coast. Flora pneumatophores, in Moreton Bay, Queensland Australian mangrove forests comprise 45 plant species from 18 families, which is more than half the world's mangrove species. One tree species, Avicennia integra, is found only in Australia - in the Northern Territory, east of Darwin. Each mangrove tree species is specific to particular latitudes and levels of tidal inundation. The greatest diversity of species is found in the far northern and north-eastern areas of Australia, and declines rapidly with increasing latitude. For example, Darwin Harbour, in the north of Australia, contains 36 mangrove tree species, while Bunbury, in the south, contains only one mangrove tree species. There are no mangroves in Tasmania. The most widespread and common mangrove tree in Australia is the grey mangrove or white mangrove (Avicennia marina). Mangrove forests also support several salt-tolerant plant species which are not classed as mangroves. In tropical areas, this may include the mangrove palm (Nypa fruticans), the mangrove fern (Acrostichum speciosum), and orchids which grow as epiphytes on the trunks and branches of mangrove trees. Other plants found in association with mangroves include the mangrove lily (Crinum pedunculatum). Mangrove forests share the high intertidal zone niche with coastal or intertidal saltmarshes; plant communities dominated by salt-resistant or salt-tolerant herbs and low shrubs. Associated fauna Mangrove forests provide breeding nurseries for a wide range of fish and crustaceans, including many species of commercial and recreational value, for example, barramundi (Lates calcarifer), mangrove jack (Lutjanus argentimaculatus), mud crabs (Scylla serrata) and banana prawn (Penaeus merguinensis). The forests also provide a habitat for spat settlement and development of oyster species. Many terrestrial fauna, such as insects, reptiles, frogs, birds and mammals, use mangroves for food, shelter, breeding and feeding grounds. The rusty monitor (Varanus semiremex) shelters in the hollows of mature or dead mangrove trees in north-eastern Queensland. The mangrove snake (Fordonia leucobalia) and estuarine crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) are found in mangrove forests in the north. The lesser noddy (Anous tenuirostris melanops) builds a platform nest of leaves in mangrove trees. This bird is listed as vulnerable under Australia's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Mangrove forests provide habitat for many small insectivorous birds, including the varied honeyeater, mangrove honeyeater, rufous-banded honeyeater, mangrove robin, lemon-bellied flycatcher, buff-sided robin, little shrike-thrush grey whistler, white- breasted whistler, northern fantail, mangrove grey fantail, Arafura fantail, broad-billed flycatcher, shining flycatcher, spectacled monarch, white-eared monarch and yellow white-eye. Other bird species observed to frequent mangrove forests are the rose-crowned fruit-dove, little bronze-cuckoo, Papuan frogmouth, azure kingfisher, little kingfisher, forest kingfisher, Torresian kingfisher, sacred kingfisher and fawn-breasted bowerbird. Mangrove forests are sometimes used as nursery areas by flying foxes in the Darwin Harbour and other areas of Australia. Several species, including the little red flying fox, are dependent on mangrove pollen as food. Economic values Mangroves protect coastal areas from erosion, storm surge, and tsunamis.Mazda, Y.; Kobashi, D. and Okada, S.

(1997) \\"Drag force due to vegetation in mangrove swamps\\" Mangroves and Salt Marshes 1: pp. 193‚Äì199 Mangroves therefore build their own environment. The commercial and recreational fishing industries are prime beneficiaries of mangrove forests, which provide breeding and feeding grounds for fish and prawns. About 75% of the fish and prawns caught for commercial and recreational purposes in Queensland spend at least part of their lifecycles in mangroves. In some coastal communities, boardwalks and bird-viewing areas in mangrove forests provide attractions for the eco- tourism industry, for example, at Boondall Wetlands. Threats Threats to mangrove ecosystems include; * coastal modifications such as reclaiming land (e.g. for building canal estates and marinas); * erosion of shorelines in coastal lakes and estuaries; * elevated levels of nutrients and sediments from land clearing, overgrazing and cropping; * increased levels of heavy metals such as copper, lead, cadmium, zinc and mercury, and tributyl tin (TBT) from anti-fouling paints; * marine oil pollution from sewage systems and drains, which is estimated at 16,000 tonnes a year over the whole of Australia; * accidental spills during re-fuelling of vessels in ports. Removal of mangrove forests can lead to erosion of the shoreline, exposure of acid sulphate soils, shallowing of estuaries and waterways, and a reduction in water quality. These threats can deplete the populations of fish, prawns, crabs and other sea life that use mangroves as breeding and feeding grounds, which would then impact on commercial and recreational fishing. Protection and preservation About one third of the total area of mangrove forest in Australia is privately owned, including Indigenous reserves. Approximately 18% of Australia's mangrove forest areas fall under the protection of National Parks and other reserves. Mangroves are protected in Queensland under the Fisheries Act 1994, and in Western Australia under the Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. As the benefits of mangroves become more widely known, grassroots efforts to protect mangroves are becoming more common. Boardwalks provide opportunities for educating people about the ecological and economic importance of mangroves.

It is located about five miles east of Sisters, on Oregon Route 126. In the late 19th century, Cloverdale became important stop on the A. J. Warrin Road, an alternative route to the Santiam Wagon Road on the way to Prineville. The community provided services for travelers and local homesteaders, with a store, blacksmith shop, and facilities for camping and boarding horses. By the 1920s or 1930s, the route fell into disuse and the buildings either fell down, were torn down, or moved. Cloverdale was named by R. A. Ford, a local farmer who was also a teacher and a county school superintendent. He surveyed the nearby Cloverdale Ditch, which is parallel to Whychus Creek. The ditch is used for irrigation. Crops grown in the area include clover, alfalfa, potatoes, grasses and vegetables. The one-room Old Cloverdale School was built on George Cyrus' land circa 1900 on what today is known as George Cyrus Road (a.k.a. Cloverdale Market Road). Also known as the Cyrus School, it is listed as a historic resource by Deschutes County. A new school was built in 1919. The 1919 school shares a site with the Cloverdale Rural Fire Protection District station and as of 2011 was in use as a preschool.

The quintessential feature of Persian architecture was its eclectic nature with elements of Assyrian, Egyptian, Median and Asiatic Greek all incorporated, yet producing a unique Persian identity seen in the finished product. Achaemenid architecture is academically classified under Persian architecture in terms of its style and design. Achaemenid architectural heritage, beginning with the expansion of the empire around 550 B.C.E., was a period of artistic growth that left an extraordinary architectural legacy ranging from Cyrus the Great's solemn tomb in Pasargadae to the splendid structures of the opulent city of Persepolis. With the advent of the second Persian Empire, the Sassanid dynasty (224‚Äì624 C.E.), revived Achaemenid tradition by construction of temples dedicated to fire, and monumental palaces. Perhaps the most striking extant structures to date are the ruins of Persepolis, a once opulent city established by the Achaemenid king, Darius the Great for governmental and ceremonial functions, and also acting as one of the empire's four capitals. Persepolis would take 100 years to complete and would finally be ransacked and burnt by the troops of Alexander the Great in 330 B.C.E. Similar architectural infrastructures were also erected at Susa and Ecbatana by Darius the Great, serving similar functions as Persepolis, such as reception of foreign dignitaries and delegates, performance of imperial ceremonies and duties, and also housing the kings. Pasargadae =Mausoleum of Cyrus the Great= Mausoleum of Cyrus the Great in Iran Dimensions of the pyramidal stone steps of the structure without the edifice shown Dimensions of the edifice and pediment roof, without the pyramidal stone structure Despite having ruled over much of the ancient world, Cyrus the Great would design a tomb that depicts extreme simplicity and modesty when compared to those of other ancient kings and rulers. The simplicity of the structure has a powerful effect on the viewer, since aside from a few cyma moldings below the roof and a small rosette above its small entrance, there are no other stylistic distractions. Structural details After his death, Cyrus the Great's remains were interred in his capital city of Pasargadae, where today his limestone tomb (built around 540‚Äì530 B.C.E.) still exists. The translated ancient accounts give a vivid description of the tomb both geometrically and aesthetically; The tomb's geometric shape has changed little over the years, still maintaining a large stone of quadrangular form at the base (forty five feet by forty two feet), followed by a pyramidal succession of seven, irregular smaller rectangular stones (possibly as a reference to the seven planets of the solar system) reaching a height of eighteen feet, until the structure is curtailed by a rectangularly formed cubical edifice with a small opening or window on the side, where the slenderest man can barely squeeze through. The roof of the edifice and indeed the structure, is an elongated limestone pediment. The edifice, or the \\"small house\\" is a rectangular, elongated cube that lies directly on top of the pyramidal stone steps, and is in width, in height, and in length. The inside of the edifice is occupied by a small chamber a few feet in width and height, and around ten feet deep. It was inside this chamber where the bed and coffin of Cyrus the Great would have been situated. The edifice has a pediment roof possessing the same length and width dimensions as the edifice itself. Around the tomb were a series of columns, the original structure which they supported is no longer present. Arrian's direct testimony indicates that Cyrus the Great was indeed buried in the chamber inside the edifice, as he describes Alexander seeing it during his visit to Pasargadae, but it is also a possibility that the body of Cyrus the Great had been interred below the structure, and that the tomb seen on the top is in fact a cenotaph or a false tomb. There was originally a golden coffin inside the mausoleum, resting on a table with golden supports, inside of which the body of Cyrus the Great was interred. Upon his resting place, was a covering of tapestry and drapes made from the best available Babylonian materials, using fine Median workmanship; below his bed was a fine red carpet, covering the narrow rectangular base of his tomb. History Translated Greek accounts describe the tomb as having been placed in the fertile Pasargadae gardens, surrounded by trees and ornamental shrubs, with a group of Achaemenian protectors (the \\"Magi\\"), stationed nearby to protect the edifice from theft or damage. The magi were a group of on-site Zoroastrian observers, located in their separate but attached structure possibly a caravanserai, paid and cared for by the Achaemenid state (by some accounts they received a salary of daily bread and flour, and one sheep payment a day). The magi were placed in charge of maintenance and also prevention of theft. Years later, in the ensuing chaos created by Alexander the Great's invasion of Persia and loss of a centralized authority directing and caring for the Magi, Cyrus the Great's tomb was broken into and most of its luxuries were looted. When Alexander reached the tomb, he was horrified by the manner in which the tomb was treated, and questioned the Magi and put them to court. On some accounts, Alexander's decision to put the Magi on trial was more about his attempt to undermine their influence and his show of power in his newly conquered empire, than a concern for Cyrus's tomb. Regardless, Alexander the Great ordered Aristobulus of Cassandreia to improve the tomb's condition and restore its interior. The tomb was originally ornamented with an inscription that, according to Strabo (and other ancient sources), stated: The edifice has survived the test of time for some 2,500 years. After the Arab invasion into Persia and collapse of the Sassanid Empire, Arab armies wanted to destroy this historical artifact, on the basis that it was not in congruence to their Islamic tenets, but quick thinking on the part of the local Persians prevented this disaster. The Persians renamed the tomb, and presented it to the invading army as the tomb of King Solomon's mother. It is likely that the inscription was lost at this time. Mohammad Reza Pahlavi (Shah of Iran), the last official monarch of Persia, during his 2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire paid significant homage to the Achaemenid kings and specially Cyrus the Great. Just as Alexander the Great before him, the Shah of Iran wanted to appeal to Cyrus's legacy to legitimize his own rule by extension. Shah of Iran however was generally interested in protection of imperial historical artifacts. After the Iranian revolution, the tomb of Cyrus the Great survived the initial chaos and vandalism propagated by the Islamic revolutionary hardliners who equated Persian imperial historical artifacts with the late Shah of Iran. There are allegations of the tomb being in danger of damage from the construction of the Sivand Dam on river Polvar (located in the province of Pars) and water related damage, but there is no official acknowledgement of this claim. United Nations recognizes the tomb of Cyrus the Great and Pasargadae as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Scholars agree that it was Darius the Great who initiated the construction and expansion of the Persepolis project, however German archaeologist Ernst E. Herzfeld, believed that it was Cyrus the Great who chose the site for the construction, although it ultimately came down to Darius the Great to finish the construction and create its impressive buildings. Excavations on behalf of the Oriental Institute of The University of Chicago, headed by Herzfeld in 1931 and later cooperation by Eric F. Schmidt in 1933 led to some of the most impressive uncovering of Achaemenid artifacts, palaces, and structures. Herzfeld felt that the site of Persepolis was made for special ceremonies and was meant to convey the power of the Achaemenid empire to its subject nations. On some accounts, Persepolis was never officially finished as its existence was cut short by Alexander the Great, who in a fit of anger, ordered the burning of the city in 330 B.C.E. Started originally by Darius the Great a century earlier, the structure was constantly changing, receiving upgrades from subsequent Persian monarchs, and undergoing renovation to maintain its impressive fa√ßade. After the burning of the city, Persepolis was deserted and it was relatively lost to history until the excavations of Herzfeld, Schmidt, and the Chicago team uncovered it in the 1930s. This great historical artifact is unfortunately at serious risk of \\"irreparable damage\\" from neglect, the elements, and vandalism. Persepolis was by no means the only large scale Achaemenid project, as Susa also hosted a similar structure initiated by Darius for similar ceremonial purposes. However, that history is able to enjoy the remains of Persepolis as opposed to meager remnants of Susa, owes partly to selection of stone in construction of Persepolis over mud-brick in Susa, and the fact that it had been relatively uninhabited, protecting it from wear and tear of inhabitants. Politically, Persepolis also was a significant find because nearby discovery of Naqsh-e Rustam, the Persian necropolis home to Darius the Great shed light on the significance it has had as one of the major capitals of the empire. Naqsh-e Rustam would not only house Darius the Great, but also his son Xerxes the Great, Artaxerxes I, and Darius II as well. The necropolis complex was looted following invasion of Alexander, and possibly in the Sassanid period and during the Arab invasion. During the time of Shah of Iran, the structure enjoyed protection and coverage as Mohammad Reza Shah appeased to its royal and national symbolism. During this time period many western politicians, poets, artists, and writers were gravitated to Iran, and Persepolis, either as a function of the political relations with the Iranian monarchy or to report on, or visit the ruins. Such figures include the procession of international dignitaries attending the 2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire held by Shah, as well as individual visits by such figures as Heinrich L√ºbke of Germany, and Ralph Graves of Life magazine. In an article in \`\`Life\`\` in 1971, Graves describes his experience at Persepolis in the following way: File:KyrosCeremonies.jpgShah of Iran's 2,500 years celebrations File:Tomb of Cyrus the Great animated.gifAn animated picture of the mausoleum File:PasargahAir.jpgTomb of Cyrus under repair =Four-winged guardian= Cyrus, with four wings, a two horned crown, and a royal Elamite clothing Perhaps one of the most memorable remaining architectural and artistic works is the bas-relief of Cyrus the Great in Pasargadae. This is a bas-relief cut upon a stone slab depicting a figure or a guardian man, most likely a resemblance of Cyrus himself, possessing four wings shown in an Assyrian style, dressed in Elamite traditional clothing, assuming a pose and figure of an Egyptian god, and wearing a crown that has two horns, in what resembles an Ovis longipes palaeoaegyptiacus. The structure originally had an upper stone slab that in three different languages, (Old Persian, Elamite, Babylonian) declared, \\"I, (am) Cyrus the king, an Achaemenid.\\" This carved in limestone writing was in place when Sir Robert Ker Poter described the piece in 1818 but, at some point has been lost. David Stronach has suggested that there were originally four such figures, set against doorways to the Palace of Cyrus in Pasargadae. That this bas-relief has such an eclectic styling with elements of Egyptian, Elamite, and Assyrian, reflects \\"..'the oecumenical attitude of the Achaemenian kings, who from the time of Cyrus, onward adopted a liberal policy of tolerance and conciliation toward the various religions embraced within their empire'...\\" It would therefore depict the eclectic nature of Achaemenid life from policies of the kings to their choice of architecture. Herodotus, recounts that Cyrus saw in his sleep the oldest son of Hystaspes, [Darius the Great] with wings upon his shoulders, shadowing with the one wing Asia, and with the other wing Europe. Noted Iranologist, Ilya Gershevitch explains this statement by Herodotus and its connection with the four winged figure in the following way: This relief sculpture, in a sense depicts the eclectic inclusion of various art forms by the Achaemenids, yet their ability to create a new synthetic form that is uniquely Persian in style, and heavily dependent on the contributions of their subject states. After all, that is what distinguishes Achaemenid architecture from those of other kingdoms. It is its originality in context of fusion and inclusion of existing styles, in such a way as to create awe-inspiring structures.

Initiated by Darius the Great around 518 B.C.E., it would grow to become a center for ceremonial and cultural festivities, a center for dignitaries and visitors to pay homage to the king, a private residence for the Persian kings, a place for satraps to bring gifts for the king in the Spring during the festival of Nowruz, as well as a place of governance and ordinance. Persepolis's prestige and grand riches were well known in the ancient world, and it was best described by the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus as \\"the richest city under the sun\\". =Structural details= Today the archaeological remnants of this once opulent city are about 70 kilometers northeast of the modern Iranian city of Shiraz, in the Pars province, in southwestern Iran. Persepolis is a wide, elevated complex 40 feet high, 100 feet wide, and a third of a mile long, composed of multiple halls, corridors, a wide terrace, and a special, double, symmetrical stairway that would provide access to the top of the terrace. The stairway would delineate relief scenes of various motifs of daily life or nature, including some that were literal as well as metaphorical; Some scenes would show natural acts such as a lion attacking its prey but bear symbolism of spring and the Nowruz festival. Other scenes would depict, subjects from all states of the empire presenting gifts to the king, as well as scenes depicting royal guards, or scenes of social interactions between the guards or the dignitaries. This stairway is sometimes referred to as \\"All countries.\\" The structure was constructed from various halls and complexes that included, hall of Apadana (the largest hall with 36 columns), \\"Tachar\\" (the private chamber of Darius the Great), \\"Hadish\\" (added later on as a private chamber for king Xerxes the Great), the \\"Talar-i-Takht\\" also known as the 100-columned hall serving as the throne hall for general meeting with the king, \\"Darvazeh-i-Mellal\\" (the gate of all nations), the \\"khazaneh\\" (the royal treasury), a hall/palace complex later on developed by Artaxerxes III, Tripylon (council hall), and the \\"rock cut tombs of the kings\\" or Naqsh-e Rustam. The most impressive hall in the complex is the Apadana hall, occupying an area of about 109 square meters with 36 Persian columns, each more than 19 m tall. Each column is fluted, with a square base (except a few in the porticos), and an elaborate capital with two animals supporting the roof. The structure was originally closed off from the elements by mud-brick walls over 5 meters thick and over 20 meters. The columns have a composite capital depicting addorsed bulls or creatures. Those columns in the porticoes not only would possess a circular base, but would also have an ornate capital after the end of the fluting, only to be curtailed by detailed addorsed bulls, supporting the roof. Apadana's relief is also unique in that it delineates the presence and power of the king. Known as \\"Treasure reliefs\\" the depicted scenes on Apadana stress the continuity of the kingdom through Darius the Great, and stress his presence throughout the empire, as well as depict his army of Persian immortals. Perhaps this was Darius's attempt to create a symbol of the assured continuity of his line. Apadana hall and the adjacent structures in the complex are believed to have been designed to host large number of people. In fact, halls of Persepolis could at any one time host some ten thousand visitors easily with the king and the royal staff seated appropriately. The grandeur of Persepolis is in its architectural details, its impressive, tall, and upright columns, in its skilfully crafted reliefs depicting people from all walks of life, and from all corners of the empire, and most importantly in its historical importance as both a political and a social center of Achaemenid royal life. =Engineering= Persepolis Fortifications (PF) Tablets, dating to between 509 and 494 B.C.E. are ancient Persian documents that describe many aspects of construction and maintenance of the Persepolis. The tablets are important because they highlight two important aspects of the Achaemenid life and the construction of Persepolis: Firstly, that the structure was created by workers, who were paid rations or wages, and secondly the structure had an intricate system of engineering involving weight bearing and architectural elements, and most notably an irrigation system composed of a system of closed pipes and open aqueducts. The following text from PF 1224, delineates both points: Water technologies The runoff and sewer network of Persepolis are among the most complex in the ancient world. Persepolis is constructed on the foot of a mountain (Rahmat Mountain), with an elevated terrace that is partially man made and partially part of the mountain complex. As Persepolis was in essence an important cultural center often used by the beginning of the spring during the festival of Nowruz it enjoyed great precipitation and water runoffs from the molten ice and snow. The sewer network assumed great importance at this critical time as it was meant to both handle the water flow downward from higher areas as well as manage the inhabitant's sewage runoffs, and their water needs. In order to prevent flooding, the Achaemenids used two engineering techniques to divert snowmelt and mountain runoff: The first strategy was to collect the runoff in a reservoir that was a well with a square opening with dimensions of 4.2 m for the square opening, and a depth of 60 m, allowing a volume of 554 cubic meters, or 554,000 liters, (60 x 4.2 x 4.2) of runoff to be collected. The water would be diverted toward the reservoir via multiple masonry gutters strategically located around the structure. The second strategy was to divert water away from the structure, should the reservoirs be filled to capacity; this system used a 180 m long conduit, with 7 m width, and 2.6 m depth located just west of the site. The water system however was far more complex than just the reservoirs and the water conduits and involved a very sophisticated ancient system of closed pipes and irrigation. The irrigation was divided into five zones, two serving north part of the structure and three the southern part. Amazingly the irrigation system was designed to be harmonious with the structure so that at places there were central drainage canals in the center of the columns and small draining holes and conduits on each floor that would take the water out of roof, each floor, and the sewage portals into an underground sewage network and away from the structure. The five zones (I‚ÄìV) all possessed a runoff capacity of 260 L/s (liter/second) which is certainly more than the amount needed for handling mountain runoff indicating that the system was also used for water supply to the inhabitants, sewage management, and even irrigation of the gardens around the structure. File:Persepolis Reservoir.pngA schematic diagram of the reservoir File:Takhtejamshid 1189.jpgA photo of the reservoir as it exists today File:Irrigation zones of Persepolis.pngIrrigation zones (I,II) in north and (III, IV, V) in south Structural technologies In order for such a massive structure to have functioned properly it meant that the weight of the roof, columns and indeed the terrace had to be distributed evenly. Construction at the base of the mountain offered some structural support. The ceiling material was a composite application of wood and stone decreasing its overall weight. Extensive use of stone in Persepolis, not only guaranteed its structural integrity for the duration of its use but also meant that its remains lasted longer than the mud-bricks of Susa palaces.

Naqsh-e Rustam would not only house Darius the Great, but also his son Xerxes the Great, Artaxerxes I, and Darius II as well. The necropolis complex was looted following invasion of Alexander, and possibly in the Sassanid period and during the Arab invasion. During the time of Shah of Iran, the structure enjoyed protection and coverage as Mohammad Reza Shah appeased to its royal and national symbolism. During this time period many western politicians, poets, artists, and writers were gravitated to Iran, and Persepolis, either as a function of the political relations with the Iranian monarchy or to report on, or visit the ruins. Such figures include the procession of international dignitaries attending the 2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire held by Shah, as well as individual visits by such figures as Heinrich L√ºbke of Germany, and Ralph Graves of Life magazine. In an article in \`\`Life\`\` in 1971, Graves describes his experience at Persepolis in the following way: File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F017011-0010, Iran, Staatsbesuch Bundespr√§sident L√ºbke.jpgLubke in his visit to Persepolis File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F017011-0008, Iran, Staatsbesuch Bundespr√§sident L√ºbke.jpgLubke and the bas-relief File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F017011-0004, Iran, Staatsbesuch Bundespr√§sident L√ºbke.jpgLubke and the wall relief File:CunninghamDunnBrownShiraz1972.jpgTheatrical performance by western artists in Shiraz Arts Festival =Vandalism= Throughout history there have been instances of neglect or vandalism in Persepolis. The most notable historical figure to vandalize this structure was Alexander the Great, who after entering Persepolis in 330 B.C.E. called it the \\"most hateful city in Asia\\" and allowed his Macedonian troops to pillage it. Despite this stern hatred, Alexander also admired the Persians as is obvious through his respect for Cyrus the Great, and his act of giving a dignified burial to Darius III. Years later upon revisiting the city he had burnt, Alexander would regret his action. Plutarch depicts the paradoxical nature of Alexander when he recounts an anecdote in which Alexander pauses and talks to a fallen statue of Xerxes the Great as if it were a live person: In retrospect, it must be understood that despite his momentary lapse of judgment and his role as having been the single most significant figure to bring an end to Persepolis, Alexander is not by any means the only. Many individuals in the following centuries would damage Persepolis including thieves and vandals during the Sassanid era. When the Arab armies invaded in the seventh century, they took to causing civil disturbances, religious persecution of Persians, and burning of the books. That no clear record of their vandalism remains to date, is most likely due to their destruction of books and historical records. During the colonial era, and in WWII, the structure would also suffer vandalism at the hands of the Allies. Natural causes such as earthquakes and winds have also contributed to the overall demise of the structure. The first French excavation in Susa carried out by the Dieulafoys and the looting and the destruction of Persian antiquities by the so-called archeologists had a deep impact on the site. Jane Dieulafoy writes in her diary: Modern graffiti on the Achaemenid relief of Rawansar rock cut tomb, 2019, Kermanshah, Iran Even to date the structure is not safe from destruction and vandalism. After the Iranian revolution, a group of fundamentalists serving Khomeini, including his right-hand man Sadegh Khalkhali, tried to bulldoze both the renown Persian poet, Ferdowsi's tomb, and Persepolis, but they were stopped by the provisional government. The gallery below highlights only some of these unfortunate acts of vandalism mostly by foreign visitors from the late 1800s to mid-1900s. Currently the structure is at high risk of \\"irreparable damage.\\" File:Persepolis sassanian horseman.jpgA graffito left during the Sassanid era by a horseman File:Stanley Persepolis graffiti.JPGA graffito left by explorer Henry Morton Stanley of New York Herald File:Persepolis graffiti.jpgEnglish graffiti left by foreign visitors =Virtual reconstruction= French archaeologist, Egyptologist, and historian Charles Chipiez (1835‚Äì1901) has created some of the most advanced virtual drawings of what Persepolis would have looked like as a metropolis of the Persian Empire. The following mini-gallery depicts his virtual recreations. The first image on the left is a view of the \\"Talar-i- Takht\\" or the 100 columns hall of Persepolis. Note on the far left portion of the image, the famous \\"lamassu\\" (or chimeric man, lion, eagle beast) greeting the visitors (look below for a picture of a lamassu). Chipiez's drawings delineate his technical prowess and attention to details. The second picture from the left, is Chipiez's drawing of the columns, their capital ornation, and roof structure of the palace of Darius in Persepolis, also known as \\"Tachar.\\" It has bull details, as well as the use of wood in construction of the roof. This explains why the palace caught fire when Alexander the Great, set it aflame. The third picture from the left, is a more detailed, technical drawing of the \\"Talar-i-Takht\\" or the 100 column hall. Note the layering of the roof, the detailing on the edges of the roof, the window structures, and the technical detailing of the construction poles. The last picture, on the right, is a panoramic view of the outside of the palace of Darius the Great in Persepolis. Details of the Persepolis reliefs are depicted as one can note the symbolic scenes of lions attacking bulls, accompanied by two groups of Persian soldiers protecting (symbolically in this case) the infrastructure above.

Item is currently on display in the Louvre, France Another decorative terra- cotta frieze from palace of Darius the Great at Susa, depicting what seems to be spirals. Note the blue color and the resemblance to the ocean Susa was an ancient city (5500 B.C.E) even by the time of the Achaemenids. Susa became a part of the Achaemenid Empire in 539 B.C.E., and was expanded upon by Darius the Great with construction of Palace of Darius, and later development of palace of Artaxerxes II. The palace had a unique Apadana, resembling the one in Persepolis, except this hall was much larger than its Persepolis counterpart covering some 9,200 square meters. Cyrus the Great chose Susa as a site for one of his fortifications creating a wall there that was significantly taller than older walls made by the Elamites. This choice might have been to facilitate the trade from Persian Gulf northward. What remains in way of structure from this once active capital, are five archaeological mounds, today located in modern Shush, in southwestern Iran, scattered over 250 hectares. =Structural details= Darius's design of his palace in Susa would resemble Persepolis structurally and aesthetically but would incorporate more of a local flair. The structure hosted a large hall of throne or Apadana similar to the Apadana of the Persepolis. This Susa version of Apadana would be composed of three porticoes at right angles to each other, one of which was closed in all three sides by the walls, and only open in its southward direction. The palace was decorated with reliefs in enameled terra-cotta of lions walking. Intricate scenes depicting archers of king Darius would decorate the walls, as well as motifs of nature such as double-bulls, unicorns, fasciae curling into volutes, and palms disposed as a flower or a bell. The archers in particular depict a unique symbiosis of Persian, Ionian and Greek artistry of the time probably reflecting the origin of the artists who were originally hired by Darius the Great, and their personal reflections on the finished work. Perhaps the most striking terra-cotta relief is that of the griffin, depicting a winged creature resembling a lion with wings of an eagle (picture not shown here). The terra-cotta brick reliefs were decorated with lively dye colorations often giving them a lifelike quality. =History= Architecturally, the palace of Darius in Susa, was the epitome of the Persian architecture at the height of the empire's growth. Originally erected by Darius, and extensively renovated and modified by Artaxerxes II, it was meant to reflect the same opulence and prestige as Persepolis. This was Darius the Great's attempt to decorate his summer capital of Susa and to show case its glory. French archaeologist Marcel-Auguste Dieulafoy discovered the remnants of the palace of Darius, among the ruins of Susa producing the artifacts of this once magnificent structure now at display in the Louvre museum, France. He also wrote a series of architectural observations known as \\"L'Art antique de la Perse\\" which made a significant impression on the art community as to the intricacy of the Achaemenid architecture. Although Dieulafoy and his wife Jane, made significant contributions in way of excavation, Susa remains were noted by many observers years before and were in fact officially noted by William K. Loftus in 1852. Susa was a wealthy city by the time Alexander the Great invaded it, and it is said that he required 10,000 camels and 20,000 donkeys to carry away the treasures. For the most part the architectural wealth of Susa lies in its palaces, and ceremonial structures most of which have been eroded away by time or wear and tear. Today the most important remnants of the Achaemenid contribution to the architecture of ancient Susa are found in remnants of the Palace of Darius the Great in the original excavation site, or hosted in foreign nations' museums as Persian artifacts. Today the archaeological remains of the structure remain exposed to the elements, wear and tear, and human activity, and it seems that remains of Susa would be forever lost to the humankind, except perhaps for few selected pieces on display at the Louvre or foreign nations' museums. Below are a few selected photos from the palace of Darius. The photo on the far left depicts the famous Archers' relief from the palace of Darius, from Susa. The second picture from the right, is a two-dimensional \\"lamassu\\" a mythical creature with wings of an eagle, head of a man, and body of a lion.

Only the foundations remain, but there was once a large hall of columns located on this structure. Naqsh-e Rustam A panorama of the Naqsh-e Rustam mountain complex Naqsh-e Rustam is an archaeological site located about 6 kilometers to the northwest of Persepolis in Marvdasht region in the Fars province of Iran. Nash-e Rustam acts as a necropolis for the Achaemenid kings, but is a significant historical entity in that it also housed ancient Elamite relief, as well as later relief by the Sassanid kings. Naqsh-e Rustam is not the actual name of this massive structure, but is the New Persian compound word composed of \\"Naqsh\\" meaning \\"face\\", or \\"facade\\", and \\"Rustam\\" referring to the hero of the Persian epic Shahnameh. The Elamites, Achaemenids, and the Sassanids lived centuries before the drafting of the Shahnameh by the Persian poet Ferdowsi, and therefore the name is a misnomer, the result of the great amnesia of Persians about their ancient past, that settled over them after being conquered by the Arabs. The name therefore is a retrospective creation, due to lack of historical documents and lack of any inclusive knowledge of its origin. In ancient Persia, this structure would overlook the now long gone city of Istakhr easily accessible from Persepolis. Istakhr had a religious role as it was the place where Achaemenids held their reverence of the water goddess Anahita. The structure is carved into a native limestone rock mountain, and houses the burial chambers of Darius the Great, Xerxes I, Artaxerxes I, and Darius II, all Achaemenid monarchs of Persia. There is also an incomplete tomb, as only its lower cruciform arm is carved out of the rock, while the rest is unfinished. It is speculated to belong to king Darius III. The kings were interred behind a facade and rock relief, that would resemble an accurate depiction of the king's own palace and its structural details. The accuracy of the facade and its association with the actual structure of the kings' palaces is so close that they almost produce a view of how the structures would have looked before time reduced them to remains; Tomb of Darius the Great, for instance mirrors his palace in Persepolis, the \\"Tachar\\" even in scale and dimensions. The tombs are carved into the mountain's side, in form of a cross (Old Persian: chalipa), depressed into the mountain's limestone background, and elevated from the ground. The relief which is found in the depressed cruciform is that which depicts the respective king's palace, and also depicts on its roof, the relief figure of the king praying, to Ahuramazda or what most believe is a reference to the Zoroastrian icon, Faravahar. One of the enigmatic features of the complex is a cubical, stone structure standing 12.5 meters tall, and around 7 meters wide, called the \\"Ka'ba-ye Zartosht\\" translating to the \\"Cube of Zoroaster\\" believed to have been constructed during the Acahemenid era and modified and changed during the Sassanid era. The structure is cubical in base, with blind impressions on the side resembling windows, and a ruined staircase leading to a small door in the front leading to a completely empty interior. There are varied speculations as to its function discussed below. The structure also once housed an ancient Elamite relief which has been almost entirely replaced by the Sassanid reliefs. Today but a figure of a man remains of the Elamite contribution to this mountain. The later Sassanids, also created their own historical signature on the structure, called the Naqsh-e Rajab. Though numerous and very detailed, the study of the Sassanid architectural achievements sheds light on some of the architectural achievements during the second Persian empire's reign.

Note the relief of Hormizd II of the Sassanids at the base =Ka'ba-ye Zartosht= A close up view of the Ka'ba-ye Zartosht (\\"Cube of Zoroaster\\") showing the stairs, the narrow opening, and the blind windows. Note its placement in a depression, as well as the unique rectangular markings on the fa√ßade This enigmatic structure stands erect around 12.5 meters tall (~ 35 feet), with a linear, cubical shape and a square base (~ 22 feet in sides), constructed in what is essentially a dug out rectangular depression, having on all but one of its sides, four rectangular depressions resembling blind windows, and multiple minute rectangular depressions in the fa√ßade interdispersed among the blind windows as well as the side housing the staircase. The staircase leads to a small door (5 feet by 6 feet in dimensions) opening to an interior apartment of about 12 feet square. The structure's roof houses a minimal entablature of a repeating square pattern. The entire structure is posited on a raised stone platform that is composed of a few stone slabs, in a sequentially smaller yet in a concentric, pyramidally shaped succession. This structure is enigmatic, both in its aesthetic choice seen in its rather odd design, and fa√ßade, as well as its location, and supposed function. \\"Zendan-i-Soleiman\\" or Jail of Solomon in Pasargadae. Note the incredible resemblance between this structure and the \\"Cube of Zoroaster\\" (shown left) down to the details of the fa√ßade From one perspective, its proximity to the kings' tombs, and its simple design, is by some scholars thought to indicate that the cube was a Zoroastrian temple, and the Naqsh-e Rustam was more than a mere place for grieving of the deceased kings, but a grand festive center where crowds would gather on festive days to observe the king pray to Ahuramazda, and bask in the structure's magnitude while praying to Ahuramazda. This would certainly be logical as the city was also adjacent to Istakhr, a major religious and cultural center. The concept of the temple being used as a fire sanctuary, is however not likely because there is no general ventilation for smoke and gasses, and also that it differs so drastically, architecturally and aesthetically from other well known contemporary temple sites in Pars. Curiously the design although unique, is not the only one of its kind. Located not far away from the Cube of Zoroaster, there exists in Pasargadae, even to date, remnants of a structure that is very similar in its square shape and design to the \\"Cube of Zoroaster\\", called \\"Zendan-i-Suleiman.\\" The name \\"Zendan-i-Suleiman,\\" is a compound word composed of the words, \\"Zendan\\" which is Persian for \\"jail\\", and \\"Suleiman\\" which is a local Persian dialect name of the King Solomon, translating to \\"Jail of Solomon.\\" Structurally both \\"Jail of Solomon\\" and \\"Cube of Zoroaster\\" have the same cubic shape, and even resemble each other in the most minute of details, including facade, and dimensions. The name \\"Jail of Solomon\\" is of course a misnomer since Solomon never did erect this structure. The term must have come as a result of a Persian tactic advised by local Persians, to protect both Cyrus the Great's tomb, and the surrounding structures including this temple, from invading Arabs' destruction, by calling the mausoleum, the \\"tomb of Solomon's mother\\" and the temple in Pasargadae, the \\"Jail of Solomon.\\" Just like the \\"Cube of Zoroaster\\", the function of the \\"Solomon's Jail\\" is not well understood. There are theories about the structures being used as a depository of objects of dynastic or religious importance as well as theories of it being a temple of fire. It should also be noted, that the structures as they exist today are not simply the work of the Achaemenid architects and have been modified, and improved by the Sassanids, who also used them for their festive, and political needs.

In this inscription Darius also details his satraps and delineates his position as the king and emperor of the Persian empire. A schematic representation of the Behistun inscription. Note from left to right: Two guards serving Darius the Great, the king himself stepping over the alleged usurper Gaumata, a group of Gaumata's magi conspirators in chains before the king Architecturally speaking, the Behistun inscription is a massive project, that entailed cutting into the rough edge of the mountain in order to create bas-relief figures as seen in the pictures above. The Behistun mountain, rises up to some 1700 feet as part of the Zagros mountain chains in Iran. The mountain's location is ideal being close to both Ecbatana and Babylonia. The bas-relief itself is located some 300 feet above the base of the mountain. The figures represent two of the king's soldiers, the king himself standing over a fallen usurper and captives of several nations possibly dissidents, or co-conspirators. The inscription itself is written in cuneiform character in Old Persian, Babylonian, and Median. The inscription is interpreted and deciphered with the help of many intellectuals and scholars, but the Orientalist Sir Henry Rawlinson is credited as being most critical in the process of deciphering the piece. Part of why the understanding of the text is so vivid today is owed to Darius the Great himself, for he wrote the message of the inscription in three language, and so allowed the modern scholars to decipher one language and follow through the other two, since the message was essentially similar in all three forms. In this sense, the Behistun inscription is not only a significant architectural work, but also a significant linguistic tool, as important to the old world understanding of ancient Persia and its languages, as Rosetta Stone is to understanding ancient Egypt and its languages.

Carl G√ºnther Ludovici (or Ludewig) (7 August 1707 in Leipzig - 5 July 1778 in Leipzig) was a German philosopher, lexicographer and economist. He edited a large part of the Grosses vollst√§ndiges Universal-Lexicon, a major German encyclopedia of the 18th century. Life Ludovici was born 7 August 1707 in Leipzig, son of Christian Ludovici (1663‚Äì1732), professor of philosophy at the University of Leipzig, theologian and Orientalist. His father had him taught by tutors from the age of two. He attended the Thomas school, where he studied with Paul Daniel Longolius. In 1724 he began studies in philosophy and theology at the University of Leipzig, where he gained a Master's degree in 1728. In 1733, he became a full professor of practical philosophy at the university. In 1739, Johann Heinrich Zedler appointed Ludovici editor of his Grosses Universal-Lexicon (Great Universal Lexicon), and he served until 1754 as chief editor of Volumes 19-64 and the supplement Volumes 1 to 4 of the largest German encyclopedia project of the 18th Century. In 1761 Ludovici became professor of Aristotelian logic. From 1765 - 1766 Ludovici was Rector of the University of Leipzig and at the same time Dean of the Faculty of Arts. Ludovici was a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the Leipzig Society of economics, the liberal arts and the German language. He was also a member of the College of the principality College, warden of the calendar system and archivist at the University of Leipzig. Work Ludovici's primary work as a professor was the presentation and interpretation of the philosophical teachings of Christian Wolff and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. He published two extensive articles which sparked heated debate in the learned world. He received complaints from professors at the University of Halle, but was led into a lively correspondence with other scholars of his time. As editor, Ludovici introduced several innovations in the Great Universal Lexicon and a significantly increased its quality. He made the bibliography at the end of each article more complete, made articles much longer and introduced biographies of living people. His prefaces to the volumes 19, 21, 23 and the first volume of the supplements are important lexicographical sources. The extensive article on Christian Wolff and the Wolffian philosophy are almost certainly his work. While editing Zedler's Universal Lexicon, Ludovici made a German translation from the French of the Dictionaire de commerce of Jacques Savary des Br√ªlons, which was published as the General Treasure Chamber between 1741-1743. From this work grew the Open Academy of Merchants, a more complete lexicon of commerce whose five volumes published by Zedler's partner Johann Samuel Heinsius began to appear in 1752 and were completed in 1756. It is the first complete German-language trade lexicon, with the last volume providing a systematic plan of this discipline. The lexicon was used in practice, as shown by the sales to commercial firms.

Over 200 participants gathered at the Sri Ram Ashram near Benson, ArizonaTimmons, p. 265 to explore ideas for merging spirituality into gay liberation. History The organizing group formed out of discussions between their members spanning 1973-1978. These discussions mixed the works of Edward Carpenter, Arthur Evans, Jungian psychology, and Hay's studies of Native American spirituality, on topics ranging from gay consciousness, gay mythos, and the evolving nature of gay subculture. By 1978, such discussions indicated the need for a retreat to focus more deeply on these topics. In the fall of 1978 Hay, Kilhefner, and Walker led a workshop at the Gay Academic Union at UCLA.Timmons, p. 261 This workshop broke from the conference's academic tone and instead led to a group discussion similar to what is now known as a \\"heart circle\\", a structure where people take it in turn to speak from the heart, without interruption. Throughout the summer of 1979, they developed and distributed what Hay termed a \\"Call\\", a flier to invite gay men to the retreat. The conference was held over the Labor Day weekend and attracted over two hundred participants.Shively, from Bronski, p. 176 The success of the retreat inspired organizers and participants to thereafter coalesce under the moniker of the Radical Faeries.

USS Herreshoff No. 306 (SP-1841), also written Herreshoff #306, was a United States Navy patrol vessel in commission from 1918 to 1922. Construction, acquisition, and commissioning At the urging of Assistant Secretary of the Navy (and future President of the United States) Franklin D. Roosevelt (1882-1945), the industrialist, financier, and philanthropist Alfred I. DuPont (1864-1935) of Wilmington, Delaware, contracted with the Herreshoff Manufacturing Company at Bristol, Rhode Island, for one of a small group of 60-ton steel-hulled boats built to a naval patrol boat design for private owners with the intention that they would be made available to the U.S. Navy in time of war. Du Ponts boat, with the builders name Herreshoff No. 306, was completed in 1917. On 14 February 1918, the U.S. Navy purchased Herreshoff No. 306 from du Pont for use as a section patrol boat during World War I. She was commissioned at Newport, Rhode Island, as USS Herreshoff No. 306 (SP-1841) on 27 February 1918. Operational history Herreshoff No. 306 proceeded to New London, Connecticut, in company with two other Herreshoff-built boats to be fitted with listening gear. She departed New London on 5 May 1918 in company with the patrol boats and bound for the Panama Canal Zone, stopping at Charleston, South Carolina; Key West, Florida; and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, en route. She arrived at Crist√≥bal in the Canal Zone on 1 June 1918 and assumed duty as harbor patrol vessel there. She continued to perform this duty until the end of World War I on 11 November 1918, after which she served the 15th Naval District as a patrol craft. Herreshoff No. 306 was loaned to the United States Department of War on 2 October 1920 for use by the United States Army Air Service in the Canal Zone. She was returned to the Navy in March 1921. Disposal Herreshoff No. 306 was taken to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and placed on sale, finally being sold to W. A. D. Smith of New York City on 1 December 1922.
