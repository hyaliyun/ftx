Plot The novels are set in a future dystopia Earth where a parallel world called Overworld reminiscent of the worlds featured in post-Tolkien secondary world fantasy has been discovered. The corporations that run Earth send actors into Overworld in order to provide the masses of an overcrowded world with virtual- reality entertainment. Hari Michaelson is a famous Actor and son of a now- mentally ill libertarian professor. On Overworld, he is the assassin Caine, while his estranged wife Shanna is another Actor playing the mage Pallas Ril. In this world Actors are people who travel to Overworld through advanced technology and assume an alternate persona which they then use to carry out 'adventures'. Pallas is captured by Ma'elKoth, the Emperor of Overworld's human kingdom of Ankhana on one of her adventures. Ma'elKoth's plan to rule Ankhana by wiping out a final resistance group, is blocked by a spell that causes others to forget the existence of the resistance group's members. The remainder of the book plays out the conflict between Ma'elKoth, Caine and the resistance. Hari finds himself manipulated by both the powers on Overworld and the Studio on Earth, and must defeat them both in order to save himself and Pallas Ril from death. Major themes Heroes Die contains moral questions the author does not believe typically arise in fantasy.Interview with Matthew Stover In a 1999 interview regarding the novel, Stover describes it as follows: > \\"It's a piece of violent entertainment that's a meditation on violent > entertainment- as a concept in itself, as a cultural obsession. It's a love > story: romantic love, paternal love, repressed homoerotic love, love of > money, of power, of country, love betrayed and employed as both carrot and > stick. It's about all different kinds of heroes and all the different ways > they die.\\" =Violence= Earth is overcrowded and oppressed, with a caste-based dystopian government; the masses turning to the adventures of the Actors such as Caine for entertainment and distraction. The violence within the Acts of Caine is often portrayed in graphic detail because that is what the viewers on Earth are seeking. Michaelson, in the character of Caine, exhibits willingness to sacrifice the citizens of Ankhana and even his friend Majesty in order to save his wife. Hari's father is a former libertarian academic who provides a counterpoint to the violence and despair of Earth.  Style  As with its sequel, Heroes Die utilizes multiple point of view; a number of characters including Hari, Shanna, and Berne are used as third-person narrators for various parts of the story. However, for the scenes from Hari's perspective when he is on Overworld as Caine, the sections are portrayed from a first- person viewpoint and are meant to be Caine's interior soliloquies he runs for the benefit of the audiences on Earth; toward the end of the novel he addresses the audience directly. These segments tend to be more in plain speech, more peppered with profanity, shorter paragraphs, and tangents that follow Caine's train of thought.  Influences  Caine mentions the book The Moon is a Harsh Mistress as the source of Pallas Rill's pseudonym, Simon Jester.

Fowler was among police and state troopers who attacked unarmed marchers that night in Marion, Alabama. A grand jury declined to indict him that year. It was not until 2005 that Fowler acknowledged shooting Jackson, a young deacon in the Baptist church, claiming to have acted in self defense. In response to Jackson's death, several days later civil rights leaders initiated the Selma to Montgomery marches as part of their campaign for voting rights. That year Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which President Lyndon B. Johnson signed. After the shooting, Fowler was reassigned to Birmingham. In 1968 he was dismissed from the state troopers after physically attacking his supervisor. He enlisted in the US Army, serving with valor in Vietnam. He was awarded two Silver Stars and a Purple Heart. After the war, he became a heroin trafficker in northern Thailand, returning to the US for brief visits. During his time in Thailand, he was convicted of heroin trafficking and served five years in a Thai prison. After returning to the US permanently in 1996, Fowler farmed with his wife in rural Geneva County, Alabama. In 2005 Fowler admitted the shooting of Jackson in an interview with a local newspaper, saying that he had acted in self defense. In 2007 he was indicted by the district attorney in Perry County for Jackson's death, and in 2010 he pleaded guilty to manslaughter. He was sentenced to six months in prison but was released one month early because of needing surgery. Beginning in 2007, Fowler was also being investigated by the FBI for the 1966 shooting death of Nathan Johnson, a black man fatally shot after being taken to the Alabaster jail. Early life and education Fowler was born in 1933 to a farming family in Geneva County, Alabama. He attended local schools, which were racially segregated, as were other public facilities at the time. He played football in high school. After graduating, he served for a period in the US Navy from 1951 to 1953 during the Korean War as an Petty officer third class, and then attended the University of Alabama in the late 1950s. He married a local woman but later they were divorced. Career After completing training, Fowler entered the Alabama State Police in 1961. By February 1965, he was a corporal. He and other state troopers were increasingly charged with managing or suppressing civil rights actions conducted by African-American groups seeking to regain their constitutional rights in the state and others of the South. The mid-1960s had become increasingly a time of tension in Jim Crow Alabama. =Shooting of Jimmie Lee Jackson= Leaders of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and other civil rights groups had come to nearby Selma, Alabama, where they were conducting protests and marches about voting rights. On the night of February 18, 1965, around 500 people left Zion United Methodist Church in Marion, intending to walk to the City Jail about a half a block away, where a young civil rights worker was being held. The march was to protest his arrest, and the unarmed marchers were singing hymns. They were met by a crowd of Marion City police officers, county sheriff's deputies, and Alabama State Troopers. In the standoff, streetlights were abruptly turned off (some sources say that they were shot out by the police), and the police began to beat the protestors. Two United Press International photographers were beaten by the police and their cameras were smashed. Jimmie Lee Jackson, his mother, Viola Jackson, and his 82-year-old grandfather, Cager Lee, and some others ran into Mack's Café by the church, pursued by about ten Alabama state troopers. Police clubbed Cager Lee to the floor and his daughter Viola rushed to his aid. The 26-year-old Jackson went to help his mother and was shot twice in the abdomen by Fowler (who was not then identified). Jackson died eight days later in the hospital on February 26, 1965. A grand jury declined to indict Fowler in September 1965, and his name was not publicized. Aftermath Jackson's death is considered the primary catalyst for the first Selma to Montgomery march that occurred a few days later on \\"Bloody Sunday\\", March 7, 1965. The violence unleashed there increased widespread public support for the movement to gain enforcement of voting rights, and later that year the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was passed. =Delayed justice= After the shooting, Fowler returned to his duties as a State Trooper. A grand jury failed to indict him for Jackson's death. He was transferred to Birmingham, Alabama, and promoted. He said that he never received any negative reaction from supervisors about the case. Interviewed in 2005 by John Fleming of the Anniston Star about the shooting, Fowler said: This was the first time he had been publicly identified as the former trooper who had shot Jackson. On May 10, 2007, 42 years after the homicide, Fowler at the age of 73 was indicted by Michael Jackson, the district attorney for Geneva County (and the first black district attorney in the state), on charges of first degree and second degree murder for the death of Jimmie Lee Jackson (no relation). Fowler subsequently surrendered to authorities. Fowler was among a number of persons who were being prosecuted in criminal cold cases from the civil rights era. At the age of 77, Fowler pleaded guilty to one count of second-degree manslaughter on November 15, 2010. Fowler apologized for the shooting but insisted that he had acted in self-defense, believing that Jackson was trying to grab his gun in the melee. Fowler was sentenced to six months in state prison. He was released early after serving five months, due to health problems that required surgery. =Shooting of Nathan Johnson= In December 2007, the Anniston Star reported new information related to the 1966 shooting death of Nathan Johnson, an African-American man, allegedly by Fowler at the Alabaster, Alabama police station. Johnson had been arrested for suspicion of drunken driving on US Highway 31 and was shot in an altercation with Fowler, then still an Alabama state trooper. The Star said these details were known to both the prosecution and defense in Fowler's 2007 case related to the shooting death of Jimmie Lee Jackson, then under prosecution. According to details in Johnson's file, \\"obtained from the National Archives through the Freedom of Information Act\\", Johnson, an African-American man, had a \\"history of mental illness, and a \\"lengthy arrest record, including a manslaughter conviction in the death of a teenager\\" in a drunk driving accident. In addition, he was \\"intoxicated when Fowler arrested him.\\" In 2011, FBI officials announced that they were seeking information about the May 8, 1966 death of 34-year-old Nathan Johnson, a cold case from the civil rights era. They repeated allegations that Fowler had fatally shot him. At the time, the press had reported that law enforcement officials said that Johnson had grabbed a billy club from Fowler and was attacking him; the officer fatally shot Johnson twice in the chest. =Dismissal from State Police= Fowler was dismissed from the state police in 1968 for physically attacking his supervisor. His supervisor, Sergeant T. B. Barden, said that Fowler was angry about a poor job evaluation and had attacked him as he was getting into his car. Fowler and his attorney George Beck said that Fowler had taken time off to mourn with his mother after his father's death. He said that the state troopers did not give him sick leave for this absence. In the melee, he rammed Barden's head into a windshield. Barden was knocked unconscious and taken by ambulance to a Birmingham hospital.Rawls, P. (2007, May 12). \\"Ex-trooper had rollercoaster career: man charged in historic killing was later fired for other reasons\\", The Charleston Gazette (subscription required) Fowler entered the US Army after being dismissed from the state troopers and served in Vietnam. His brother Robert had died there, and Fowler was able to join his former rifle unit. In 2007 Barden said that after Fowler returned to the United States withdrawal from Vietnam, he called his former supervisor and apologized for his action. Barden said that they had a good talk and he bore no ill will toward Fowler. He had thought the man bound for a promising career before that incident.Fleming, John. (10 May 2007). \\"State records: Fowler discharged after he beat superior officer\\", The Anniston Star = US Army service and decades in Southeast Asia= Fowler served with the U.S. Army in Vietnam War from 1968 to 1974 as a Sergeant First Class and was awarded Silver Star & 10 Oak leaf cluster for gallantry in action, Bronze Star Medal & 2 Oak leaf cluster for leadership in action, and Purple Heart for his injuries in combat during his military service. After the US pulled out of Vietnam, Fowler remained in Southeast Asia, living and working in northern Thailand. For the next two decades, Fowler returned to the United States for brief periods to take care of business in Alabama but lived primarily in Thailand. During this period he became interested in Buddhism, married Noie, a woman from Burma, and started a family in Thailand. In the late 1980s Fowler testified in a military case involving a alleged murder-for-hire plot, in which an army sergeant wanted to kill his captain. His life took another turn a few years later, when Fowler was convicted by Thai authorities of heroin trafficking. He served about five years in a Thai prison.  Later life  After returning to the United States for good in 1996, Fowler settled with his second wife on a farm in rural Geneva County. He farmed for the remainder of his life. Fowler expressed a racist attitude in a 2005 interview with a local newspaper. He said that he greatly respected such black leaders as Nelson Mandela and Colin Powell, but generally did not think that blacks and whites should mix in society.  Death  Fowler died of pancreatic cancer on July 5, 2015, in Geneva County, Alabama at the age of 81.

For a given aircraft weight, engine thrust, aircraft configuration, and runway condition, the shortest runway length that complies with safety regulations is the balanced field length. The rejected takeoff initial actions speed V1, or critical engine-failure recognition speed (Vcef),MIL-STD-3013A is the fastest speed at which the pilot must take the first actions to reject the takeoff (RTO). At speeds below V1 the aircraft may be brought to a halt before the end of the runway. At V1 the pilot must continue the takeoff even if an emergency is recognized. To achieve a balanced field takeoff, engine power is selected to provide enough acceleration so that at the lowest possible speed to continue the takeoff the remaining necessary takeoff distance with one engine not working is equal to the remaining and necessary accelerate-stop distance. The balanced field length is the shortest field length at which a balanced field takeoff can be performed.\\"If we let A be the distance traveled by the airplane along the ground from the original starting point to the point where V1 is reached, and we let B be the additional distance traveled with an engine failure (the same distance to clear an obstacle or to brake to a stop), then the balanced field length is by definition the total distance A+B.\\" Anderson, John D. Jr (1999), Aircraft Performance and Design, Section 6.7, McGraw-Hill, Factors affecting the balanced field length include: * the mass of the aircraft – higher mass results in slower acceleration and higher takeoff speed * engine thrust – affected by temperature and air pressure, but reduced thrust can also be deliberately selected by the pilot * density altitude – reduced air pressure or increased temperature increases minimum take off speed * aircraft configuration such as wing flap position * runway slope and runway wind component * runway conditions – a rough or soft field slows acceleration, a wet or icy field reduces braking Calculation of the balanced field length traditionally involves relying on an expansion program model, where the various forces are evaluated as a function of speed, and step-wise integrated, using an estimate for V1. The process is iterated with different values for the engine failure speed until the accelerate-stop and accelerate-go distances are equal. This process suffers from the inherently slow and repetitive approach, which is also subject to round-off errors if the speed increment between the steps is not carefully selected, which could cause some issues in first principle aircraft performance models provided to airlines for day-to- day operations. Alternate approaches using a more mathematically complex but inherently more accurate and faster algebraic integration method have however been developed.http://papers.sae.org/2013-01-2324/ Regulatory background Aviation regulations, especially FAR 25 and CS-25 (for large passenger aircraft) require the takeoff distance and the accelerate-stop distance to be less than or equal to the available runway length, both with and without an engine failure assumed. The speed below which takeoff must be aborted upon engine failure is called V1. On longer runways a pilot can nominate a V1 within a range, but where the runway length is no longer than the balanced field length only one value for V1 will exist.

Using the balanced field takeoff concept, V1 is the maximum speed in the takeoff at which the pilot must take the first action (e.g. reduce thrust, apply brakes, deploy speed brakes) to stop the airplane within the accelerate-stop distance and the minimum speed at which the takeoff can be continued and achieve the required height above the takeoff surface within the takeoff distance.

Publication history Spymaster is a Marvel Comics supervillain, who is a recurring foe to Iron Man. He is a master of industrial espionage. His identity has changed several times over the years. The first appearance of the character is in Iron Man #33 (Jan 1971), and he was created by Allyn Brodsky, Don Heck, and Stan Lee. Fictional character biography =Original Spymaster= The original Spymaster was a costumed freelance industrial spy, saboteur, and assassin with advanced weaponry. He was a master of espionage, and died without revealing his true identity, although it is known that he was once a boxer. He and his team of assistants, the Espionage Elite, were hired by the criminal organization the Zodiac to infiltrate Stark Industries and steal all of company owner and genius inventor Tony Stark's secrets. His efforts were stopped by Stark's alter-ego, the armored superhero Iron Man. However, he was assigned by the Zodiac to capture Daredevil but failed at that as well. Spymaster aided Aquarius, Capricorn, and Sagittarius in an attempt to steal the Zodiac Key from Stark. The Spymaster was transported to the other-dimensional realm of the Brotherhood of the Ankh, but returned to Earth and escaped.Iron Man 33-34, 35; Daredevil #73; Iron Man #36 Spymaster was assigned by renegade S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to assassinate Tony Stark, but failed.Iron Man #113, 115-117 He was employed by Madame Masque to steal a prototype energizer link, and abducted Bethany Cabe.Iron Man #138-139 (Sept. - Oct. 1980) Spymaster would come into conflict with Iron Man several more times, and on one occasion with the masked hero Daredevil. At one point Spymaster apparently succeeded in assassinating Tony Stark, but in reality it was a Life Model Decoy. He also succeeded in stealing many of Stark's Iron Man designs, giving them over to Stark's rival Justin Hammer, sparking the Armor Wars event. Stark believes that Spymaster may have found out his secret identity, but that Spymaster kept it to himself.Iron Man #225 The first Spymaster last appeared after coming into conflict with fellow Iron Man villain the Ghost, who has technology enabling him to become intangible. After Spymaster attempted to assassinate the Ghost in Los Angeles under orders from Roxxon, Iron Man arrived, causing the two villains to attempt an escape. The Ghost offered Spymaster one of his intangibility devices, and Spymaster used the device to pass through a wall. The Ghost removed the device from Spymaster's chest while he was still phasing halfway through a wall, causing him to rematerialize partially inside the wall and killing him instantly.Iron Man #220 During the Dark Reign storyline, it is revealed that he actually faked his own death and has been living in deep cover ever since until he is found by Norman Osborn. Spymaster is hired to steal a treasured photograph of Tony Stark's parents, which Norman Osborn then burns.Dark Reign: Made Men 2009 During the Infinity storyline, Spymaster recruits Blizzard II, Constrictor, Firebrand IV, Unicorn I, Whiplash IV, and Whirlwind to help him in a plot to attack the almost-defenseless Stark Tower while the Avengers were away from Earth fighting the Builders. In the same issue, Spymaster apparently runs the Black Market Club (a nightclub for supervillains).Infinity: Heist #1 =Nathan Lemon= The second Spymaster was an accomplished student of the Taskmaster who won the right to the name in a series of tests including a final test of killing all other contenders in a battleground simulator, with all contestants blindfolded. This new Spymaster was appointed by the Taskmaster for Justin Hammer, and battled Iron Man in his first appearance.Iron Man #254 This iteration had one of his own Espionage Elite bug Tony Stark's office, and overheard Stark and his secretary Pepper Potts talking about Stark's double identity. Acting under orders from the Mandarin, his Elite ambushed and beat Stark severely, until the Black Widow intervened.Iron Man (3rd series) #8 In 2007, Spymaster II, who has had no known identity, was retroactively named Nathan Lemon due to a series' 'flashback' episode in which Stark delves into his mind and figures out his name. Sinclair Abbot, the third Spymaster, claimed he had Lemon killed in prison.Iron Man: The Inevitable #1-5 =Sinclair Abbot= Sinclair Abbot, a wealthy industrialist, is the latest person to hold the Spymaster mantle. He achieved this by having the previous one arrested, severely beaten in jail, and then killed in intensive care by his wife. His debut was in the miniseries Iron Man: The Inevitable. He has yet to attempt any direct action against Iron Man, choosing to send Ghost against him, and playing mind-games with Stark at public events, subtly jabbing him about his alcoholism and former military contracts. Abbot feels that to be a true supervillain, he needs to prove his mettle against Iron Man, while at the same time, to humble Iron Man; it has been an extended period of time since Iron Man has fought a \\"supervillain\\" in the classical sense, and Abbot resents the apparent indication that Iron Man is \\"too good\\" for supervillains, as if he is above that station.Iron Man: The Inevitable #1-6 (2005) With the Civil War causing Tony Stark considerable problems, the Spymaster was hired by Karim Wahwash Najeeb (chairman of the World Islamic Peace Coalition and one of the men responsible for the death of Stark's mentor Ho Yinsen) to kill Iron Man. Spymaster killed Tony Stark's chauffeur and attempted to use Happy Hogan as live bait to draw Iron Man, but Hogan managed to attack him and both fell several stories to the ground, which led to the death of Hogan, one of Tony's oldest and dearest friends.Iron Man (4th series) #13 Spymaster later resurfaced where he has a bomb planted in him by Mandarin and Zeke Stane as they force him to assist other villains in attacking Iron Man.Invincible Iron Man #516 After being defeated and rendered powerless during an attempted assault on Stark Resilient (deprived of his suit and weaponry while awaiting transfer to a Supermax prison), he apparently commits \\"Suicide by cop\\" and is shot multiple times by the policemen guarding him.Invincible Iron Man #519 Powers and abilities Each Spymaster has no superhuman abilities. However, each is an exceptional fighter and strategist. The first Spymaster was an excellent hand-to-hand combatant, with formal training in boxing and various martial arts. The second Spymaster is also an excellent hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained at the Taskmaster's Academy. Each is also an extraordinary industrial spy and saboteur, master of disguise, a superb actor, a highly agile and skilled athlete, and greatly skilled in the uses of virtually any kind of gun. Spymaster always has access to cutting-edge technology for a number of espionage-related devices and weapons, both of his own design and those of Justin Hammer's. The original Spymaster used various special devices including, devices in his gloves and mask that projected concussive energy blasts, small and powerful hovering electromagnets, incendiary missiles, \\"razor-discs\\" that could pierce Iron Man's armor, devices that enabled him to absorb Iron Man's repulsor energy, stunguns, sleep inducing \\"somnu-gas\\", boot jets that allowed flight, and a device in his belt buckle that summoned an advanced model hovercraft that could operate automatically according to pre-programmed instructions. Both the first and second Spymasters have employed electronically amplified nun-chakas that can damage Iron Man's armor. The Spymaster wears a battlesuit of bulletproof Kevlar body armor which provides some protection from physical attacks, and which contains various pockets for holding weaponry.

It was a sauropod which lived in what is now Utah. It was first described by Tidwell, Carpenter and Brooks in 1999. It shows similarities to the brachiosaurid Eucamerotus from the Wessex Formation of southern England, as well as to Brachiosaurus from the Morrison Formation. Description Size comparison Cedarosaurus had a more gracile ulna and radius than its relative Venenosaurus. The ratio of the radius' least circumference to its length is .31 in Cedarosaurus. Metatarsal II is more gracile in Cedarosaurus. Its middle tail vertebrae's neural spines are angled anteriorly when the vertebrae are aligned. These vertebrae resemble those of Gondwanatitan, Venenosaurus, and Aeolosaurus. The related Venenosaurus had unusual lateral fossae, which looked like deep depressions in the outside walls of the vertebral centra. Some fossae are divided into two chambers by a ridge inside the depression. In most sauropods the fossae would form pneumatic openings leading to the interior of the centrum, rather than just being a depression. Less well-developed, but similar fossae are known from Cedarosaurus itself. Palaeobiology In 2001 Frank Sanders, Kim Manley, and Kenneth Carpenter published a study on 115 gastroliths discovered in association with a Cedarosaurus specimen. The stones were identified as gastroliths on the basis of their tight spatial distribution, partial matrix support, and an edge-on orientation indicative of their being deposited while the carcass still had soft tissue. Their high surface reflectance values are consistent with other known dinosaur gastroliths. Nearly all of the Cedarosaurus gastroliths were found within a .06 m volume of space in the gut region of the skeleton. The total mass of the gastroliths themselves was . Most were less than in volume. The least massive clast was and the most was , with most of them being toward the smaller end of that range. The clasts tended to be close to spherical in shape, although the largest specimens were also the most irregular. The largest gastroliths contributed the most to the total surface area of the set. Some gastroliths were so large and irregularly shaped that they may have been difficult to swallow. The gastroliths were mostly composed of chert, with some sandstone, siltstone, and quartzite clasts also included. Some of the chert clasts actually contained fossils. Since some of the most irregular gastroliths are also the largest, it is unlikely that they were ingested by accident. Cedarosaurus may have found irregular clasts to be attractive potential gastroliths or was not selective about shape. The clasts were generally of dull coloration, suggesting that color was not a major factor for the sauropod's decision making. The high surface area to volume ratio of the largest clasts suggests that the gastroliths may have broken down ingested plant material by grinding or crushing it The sandstone clasts tended to be fragile and some broke in the process of collection. The sandstone gastroliths may have been rendered fragile after deposition by loss of cement caused by the external chemical environment. If the clasts had been that fragile while the animal was alive, they probably rolled and tumbled in the digestive tract. If they were more robust, they could have served as part of a ball-mill system. Footnotes References Tidwell, V., Carpenter, K. and Brooks, W.

Its population is approximately The city is situated in the south-western Altai Mountains and north-eastern of the region's capital, Oskemen, along the Ulba River, at an elevation higher than 700 metres. History The fact that Altai Krai is rich in natural deposits was discovered during Empress Catherine the Great's reign. The history of Ridder started in 1786 when 9 troops of men were sent to the Altai region to search for natural resource deposits. One of these troops was headed by an officer, Philip Ridder. On May 31, 1786, he found a very rich deposit containing gold, silver and other metals. The same year, in summer, the settlement was founded there and it was named Riddersky pit. This was how the city was founded. The unique ores of the Riddersky deposit were noted by specialists of various levels and commissions. The deposit became known far beyond Russia. In 1850, Riddersky ores received the highest appreciation at The Great Exhibition in London. In 1879 the samples were included into the museum collection of the Stockholm Royal Technical Institute. During the early 20th century Ridder experienced a number of foreign concessions, revolution and Civil war. On February 10, 1934, the settlement of Ridder was designated a town.https://ru.wikisource.org/wiki/%D0%9F%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5_%D0%92%D0%A6%D0%98%D0%9A_%D0%BE%D1%82_10.02.1934_%D0%9E%D0%B1_%D1%83%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B6%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B8_%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE_%D1%81%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0_%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%B2_%D0%B8_%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%87%D0%B8%D1%85_%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2_%D0%9A%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B9_%D0%90%D0%A1%D0%A1%D0%A0 In 1941, just before World War II, the town of Ridder was renamed to Leninogorsk (in honour of Lenin).

C. gigas is known only from two neck vertebrae (specimens BMNH 46869, the holotype, and BMNH 46870), with distinctive hollows and internal passages now interpreted as evidence of pneumatic air sacs.

For this post he wrote sacred and secular music, for voice or voices and lute or continuo. He also wrote music to accompany the ballet or other dances. He taught Gaston's daughter, Mlle de Montpensier. Moulinié worked for Gaston until the latter's death in 1660, at which point he was forced to find new employment.

It has been considered to be both a hadrosaurid and a ceratopsid, sometimes the same as Triceratops, with two different assignments as to discovery formation and location, and what bones make up its type remains. History The holotype specimen, AMNH 3978, was described by paleontologist and naturalist Edward Drinker Cope, who interpreted it as the rostral bone and predentary of an \\"agathaumid\\" (ceratopsid) dinosaur, which he said came from the Laramie Formation of Colorado.Cope, E.D. (1892). Fourth note on the Dinosauria of the Laramie. The American Naturalist 26:756-758. It was soon thought to be a hadrosaurid, though.Hatcher, J.B. (1902).

Government Printing Office:Washington, D.C., 300 pp. In 1904, Franz Baron Nopcsa reclassified it as a ceratopsid. In their influential monograph, Richard Swann Lull and Nelda E. Wright regarded the genus as a dubious type of hadrosaurid, based on premaxillae and a predentary.Lull, R.S., and Wright, N.E. (1942). Hadrosaurian Dinosaurs of North America. Geological Society of America Special Paper 40:1-242. This opinion stood until the work of Michael K. Brett-Surman, who stated in his dissertation that, having rediscovered and reexamined the material with Douglas A. Lawson, it was most likely part of a ceratopsid's neck frill, probably part of the squamosal of Triceratops.Brett-Surman, M.K. 1989(1988).

This information reached Donald F. Glut's series of dinosaur encyclopedias in a confusing form; its entry states that a squamosal and tooth from South Dakota were referred to the genus, and these are what Brett-Surman and Lawson identified, keeping the supposed beak remains separate.

It is used in the short-term management of obesity, along with dietary and lifestyle changes. Amfepramone is most closely chemically related to the antidepressant and smoking cessation aid bupropion (previously called amfebutamone), which has also been developed as a weight-loss medicine when in a combination product with naltrexone.  Pharmacology  Amfepramone itself lacks any affinity for the monoamine transporters and instead functions as a prodrug to ethcathinone. Ethcathinone (and therefore amfepramone as well) is a very weak dopaminergic and serotonergic, and is approximately 10x and 20x stronger on norepinephrine in comparison, respectively. As a result, ethcathinone and amfepramone can essentially be considered a member of the class of drugs known as norepinephrine releasing agents (NRAs). Chemistry Amfepramone can be synthesized from propiophenone by bromination, followed by reaction with diethylamine. Society and culture =Names= Another medically-utilized name is diethylpropion (BAN and AAN). Chemical names include: α-methyl-β-keto-N,N-diethylphenethylamine, N,N-diethyl-β- ketoamphetamine and N,N-diethylcathinone. Brand names include: Anorex, Linea, Nobesine, Prefamone, Regenon, Tepanil and Tenuate. = Legality = Amfepramone is classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance in the United States. It is also a Schedule IV controlled substance in Canada. In the UK Amfepramone is a class C drug and as a medicine, it is a Schedule 3 Controlled Drug which requires safe custody. = Recreational Use = The authors of several studies of Amfepramone claim that the substance has a relatively low potential for causing addiction in users.

The documentary about the Kurdish family in Turkey was created by Passionate Productions and was broadcast on 17 March 2006. The narrator is Jemima Harrison. A revised version of the documentary that shifts the focus away from the story of the discovery of the family and includes the views of additional scientists was shown on NOVA on 14 November 2006. Background Debate exists as to the nature and cause of the family's walking, including controversial speculation in the form of the Uner Tan syndrome that it may be a genetic throwback to pre-bipedal hominid locomotion. However, Nicholas Humphrey, who accompanied the documentary makers, concluded that it was due to a rare set of genetic and developmental circumstances coming together. First, their mother recalls that initially all of her 19 children started off walking with a bear- crawl (i.e. on their feet rather than their knees). Second, due to an inherited recessive genetic mutation, they have a non-progressive congenital cerebellar ataxia that impairs the balance children normally use to learn to walk bipedally. Not being able to manage the balance needed for bipedal walking, they perfected in its place their initial bear-crawl into an adult quadruped gait. The family's walking likely has nothing to do with genes involved in the human evolution of upright walk. Synopsis In June 2005, Nicholas Humphrey receives a call from Dr. John Skoyles who has seen an unpublished paper by Turkish Professor Uner Tan that focuses upon hand dominance in the family. In the film, Two British scientists and Tan visit the family and their father, Resit. There are 19 children in the family, 12 of them typical, and seven were handicapped, one of whom died. The commentary first introduces Gülin and notes that he \\"staggers as if he's drunk\\" but walks on two feet. Then each of the affected hand-walking individuals is introduced: the four sisters Safiye, Hacer, Senem and Emine, and their brother, Hüseyin. Contrasting with these scenes of sadness, we then see the family enjoying themselves at a sandy beach only an hour’s drive away. In spite of its nearness, they have never been to the sea before. They are shown paddling and touching the sea waves. Hatice, their mother, upon seeing the sea for the first time in her life, says that she did not know that Allah had made such beauty. The narrator explains that it has been explained to the family that the film will put the world’s spotlight on them. Resit says he does not want them compared to monkeys. He does not believe in evolution but also he philosophically observes words cannot harm them and film might bring help and a little understanding. Professor Nicholas Humphrey expresses his concern that this phenomenon may never be seen again. In January 2006, the film makers return to the family. Before they left, parallel bars had been bought on Dr. Ali’s advice and put outside so the family could exercise upright walking and they have done this nearly every day. The family is seen smiling as they have made progress in learning to walk - and the film closes with Hüseyin walking up a path on two legs.

Many children left their schools and were arrested, set free, and then arrested again the next day. The marches were stopped by the head of police, Bull Connor, who brought fire hoses to ward off the children, and set police dogs after the children. This event compelled President John F.

Markakis was the Orioles' first-round draft pick, seventh overall, in the 2003 Major League Baseball Draft. He previously played for the Baltimore Orioles from 2006 to 2014. He made his MLB debut in 2006. Markakis is a three-time Gold Glove Award winner, and he won a Silver Slugger Award and was named an MLB All-Star in 2018. Markakis holds the MLB record for consecutive games by an outfielder without making an error (398). Early life Markakis was born in Glen Cove, New York, but moved to Woodstock, Georgia, when his family, which includes his parents, Dennis and Mary Lou and his brothers Dennis, Greg and Michael relocated. He is of Greek and German descent. Collegiate and Olympic career Markakis was originally drafted in 2001 by the Cincinnati Reds, from Woodstock High School in Woodstock, Georgia, but did not sign. Markakis instead attended Young Harris College, where he played college baseball for the Young Harris Mountain Lions baseball team. The Reds drafted him again in 2002, but he returned to Young Harris. Markakis played as both an outfielder and a pitcher, hitting .439 with 21 home runs and 92 runs batted in (RBIs), while also garnering a 12–0 win–loss record as a pitcher with one save and a 1.68 earned run average in 15 games. He was twice named Georgia Junior College Player of the Year, and was awarded Baseball America's 2002 National JUCO Player of the Year. In August 2003, Markakis played for the Greek national baseball team in the European National Championships, winning a silver medal with Team Greece. Alt URL He also played for the Greek national baseball team in the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece. Professional career =Baltimore Orioles= Minor leagues Markakis was the Orioles' first-round draft pick, seventh overall in the 2003 Major League Baseball Draft. Owning a fastball that was clocked as high as 96 miles per hour, Markakis was widely viewed as a pitching prospect but the Orioles preferred his potential as a hitter. Markakis spent his first year with the Aberdeen IronBirds and then the Delmarva Shorebirds in 2004, where he hit .299 with 11 homers and led the team with 64 RBIs despite missing the last month of the season playing for Greece in the Olympics. In 2005, Markakis started the year with the Frederick Keys and was named the top Orioles prospect by Baseball America. He won the Carolina/California League All-Star Game Home Run Derby, and followed that up by being named MVP of the All-Star game after hitting two homers. Markakis was promoted a short time later to the Bowie Baysox and was ultimately named to the Second Team in the 2005 Minor League All-Star Roster. He also received the Brooks Robinson Award as the organization's Minor League Player of the Year. 2006 Markakis began his first spring training with the Orioles in 2006 by reaching base in nine of his first ten plate appearances. He earned an Opening Day roster spot. Markakis made his major league debut on April 3, 2006, when he was used as a late-inning defensive replacement against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. He received his first start and plate appearances two days later. Hitting second and playing left field, he drew three walks in his first three plate appearances and hit a 400-foot home run for his first major league hit in the 16–6 win. On August 22, 2006, Markakis went 3 for 4 with 3 home runs in an Orioles 6–3 win at Camden Yards. Not only was it his first three-run game, became the 18th Oriole to do so and the first since 1999. The feat prompted a curtain call from the dugout, earning him a feat that The Washington Post called \\"an ovation that is rarely seen in these parts anymore. Curtain calls are for Yankee Stadium and Fenway Park, not Camden Yards.\\" Markakis finished his rookie season with a .291 average, 16 homers, 62 RBIs and 2 stolen bases. On defense, he put up impressive stats in defensive ratings such as range factor and fielding percentage, ranking second among major league right fielders. 2007 Baltimore Orioles in 2007 spring training Markakis began the season as the starting right fielder. He finished the season with a .300 average, 23 home runs, 112 RBIs and 18 stolen bases. His home run and RBI totals ranked first on the team. Markakis was third in the AL in games played (161), seventh in at-bats (637), sixth in doubles (43), seventh in hits (191), eighth in RBIs (112) and third in grounding into double plays (22). Markakis also continued to play good defense as finished fifth in the league with 13 assists and sixth with a .994 fielding percentage. He was charged with just 2 errors in 318 total chances. At the end of the season, Markakis could not agree to a contract extension with the Orioles and his contract was automatically renewed for another year at the baseline value of $455,000. He became eligible for arbitration after the 2008 season, and in the absence of a contract extension, would have become a free agent in 2011. 2008–2010 Markakis began the season as the team's #3 hitter and starting right fielder. He played well early in the year, but as the season went into the summer months, Orioles manager Dave Trembley opted to move him into the #2 hole, placing Melvin Mora behind him. Markakis finished the season in the top 10 in the American League in AVG, OBP, OPS, games played, runs, hits, doubles, bases on balls, *OPS+, and RC (runs created). He also led the league in times on base. He raised his batting average to .306, slugged 20 home runs, hit 48 doubles (3rd in the major leagues), recorded 87 RBIs, scored 106 runs and stole 10 bases on the season. He also had another stellar year in right field, notching 17 assists, which led the majors. Baltimore Orioles in 2009 Markakis signed a 6-year, $66.1 million extension through 2014 on January 22, 2009.Markakis takes place as face of Orioles The Baltimore Sun Markakis has also been honored with his very own shirt this season called \\"Nick the Stick, Camden's Finest.\\"Nick the Stick 21, Camden's Finest shirt SportsCrack.com He finished the season with a .293 average, 18 home runs, 45 doubles (7th in the majors), 101 RBIs, 94 runs, and 6 stolen bases, in addition to being 4th in the majors with 14 outfield assists. Markakis had a stellar 2010 season with the Orioles, finishing with a .297 average, recording 45 doubles (fifth in the majors), 60 RBIs, 79 runs and seven stolen bases. 2011–2014 Markakis got his 1,000th career hit against the Cleveland Indians on July 15, 2011. At the end of the season, he was awarded a Gold Glove. After surgery to remove part of the hamate bone in his right wrist, Markakis was placed on the disabled list for the first time in his career on June 1, 2012. He began his minor league rehab games with the Double-A Bowie Baysox on July 7, and returned to the Orioles on July 13. On September 8, Markakis was hit by a pitch by Yankees pitcher CC Sabathia and suffered a fractured thumb. He then missed the rest of the season and postseason. He later said that he would have been ready to play had the Orioles made it to the World Series; the team was eliminated in five games by the New York Yankees in the American League Division Series. During the 2013 campaign, Markakis was hampered by his wrist injury from the previous season. Markakis had a career low in batting average (.271) and home runs (10), along with 59 runs batted in which was also far below his 162-game average of 81. However, he continued to play stellar defense, committing no errors for a perfect 1.000 fielding percentage. Coming off his worst offensive season, Markakis added 16 pounds of muscle in the offseason. April 26, Markakis got the start at first base against the Kansas City Royals due to an injury to teammate Chris Davis in the previous game. It was the first appearance at first base for Markakis since 2011. During the game, Markakis went 2-for-5 with two RBIs including a game winning walk-off single in the bottom of the 10th inning. Through his first 102 games, Markakis had a .290 batting average with 34 runs batted in, 50 runs scored, and seven home runs, continuing his errorless streak. On August 3, 2014, Markakis collected his 1,500th career hit against Seattle Mariners pitcher Hisashi Iwakuma in the bottom of the third inning at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. In his previous at-bat he collected his first career lead-off home run, a solo shot to right field to give the Orioles a 1–0 lead in the first inning. =Atlanta Braves= On December 3, 2014, Markakis agreed to a four-year $44 million contract with the Atlanta Braves. 2015–2017 On June 18, 2015, Markakis passed Darren Lewis for the record of most errorless games by an outfielder in a game against the Boston Red Sox. The streak later ended on June 25, 2015, during a game against the Washington Nationals at 398 games. On July 20, Markakis hit his first home run as a Brave against the Los Angeles Dodgers, off of Brandon Beachy. He hit two more home runs over the course of the season for a career low total of three. His 181 total hits ranked fourth in the National League. In 2016, he rebounded offensively from his first season with Atlanta despite hitting a career low .269. He hit 13 home runs and drove in 89 RBIs, his most since 2009. Markakis recorded his 2,000th career hit against the Los Angeles Dodgers on August 3, 2017. He finished the season with a .275 batting average, 76 RBIs, 163 hits, and eight home runs. 2018 Markakis scored his 1,000th career run on June 1, 2018, against the Washington Nationals. Batting .322 with ten home runs and 59 RBIs, he was named a starting outfielder for the 2018 MLB All-Star Game. He set new records for the most career hits (2,172) and most games played (1,933) by a player making his debut as an All-Star. Markakis, following another impressive defensive season in right field, earned his third Gold Glove award in 2018. In addition to the Gold Glove, Markakis also won his first career Silver Slugger as an outfielder after finishing the season with a .297 batting average, 185 hits, 14 home runs, and 93 RBIs, all highs while a member of the Braves. He was also durable, having appeared in all 162 games for the first time in his career, while also leading the league in games played. 2019 After the 2018 season, Markakis signed a one-year contract with the Braves for the 2019 season worth $4 million, with a $6 million club option for 2020, and a $2 million buyout in case the Braves decline the option. On July 26, 2019, Markakis was struck by a pitch from Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Cole Irvin, and left the game. Prior to his placement on the 10-day injured list, Markakis had played in every game of the 2019 season to that point. He returned to the active roster on September 13. In 2019 he batted .285/.356/.420 with nine home runs and 62 RBIs. The Braves' declined Markakis' contract option in November 2019, instead agreeing to a one-year contract for the 2020 season, worth $4 million. 2020–current Following a discussion with teammate Freddie Freeman, who was diagnosed with COVID-19 before the 2020 season began, Markakis initially decided to opt out of the 2020 season. On July 29, however, Markakis announced that he planned to rejoin the Braves. He was added to the team's active roster on August 5.

In 2020 he batted .254 (a career low)/.312/.392 with 15 runs, one home run, and 15 RBIs in 130 at bats. Personal life Growing up, Markakis was a Boston Red Sox fan. He wore #21 while with the Orioles in honor of Roger Clemens, but changed to #22 upon joining the Braves, as #21 is retired for Warren Spahn. Coincidentally, #22 was the number of right fielder Jason Heyward, who was traded from the Braves to the St. Louis Cardinals before the 2015 season, and replaced by Markakis. Markakis married Christina Dutko in 2008. He became the brother-in-law of Ryan Flaherty when the latter married Christina's sister Ashley in 2016.Crasnick, Jerry. \\"Nick Markakis, Ryan Flaherty more than just Braves teammates,\\" ESPN.com, Tuesday, May 29, 2018.

Both bases were turned over to Panama in 1999. History Ruins of Coastal Defence Artillery, Battery Mower, at Ft. Sherman Ft. Sherman Dock, Panama in 2008, now Shelter Bay Marina Concurrent with the Canal construction a number of defensive locations were developed to protect it, both with coastal defense guns, as well as military bases to defend against a direct infantry assault. Fort Sherman was the primary Caribbean-side infantry base, while Fort Amador protected the Pacific side. Construction of Fort Sherman began in January 1912 as a phase of the original 1910 defensive plans. Fort Sherman was named by War Department General Order No. 153 dated November 24, 1911, in honor of General Sherman. The Fort included of land, about half of which was covered by jungle. The developed areas included housing, barracks for 300, a small airstrip and various recreational areas. Sherman was the site of the US's first operationally deployed early warning radar when an SCR-270 was installed there in 1941.

JOTC was founded in 1951 to train both US and allied Central American forces in jungle warfare, with an enrollment of about 9,000 a year. The JOTC also taught a 10-day Air Crew Survival Course, open to all branches of service, and a four-week Engineer Jungle Warfare Course. Upon completion of the course the Jungle Expert Patch was awarded. Between 1966 and 1979, 1,160 sounding rockets with maximum flight altitudes of 99 kilometres were launched from Fort Sherman. Fort Sherman was used in the filming of the 2008 James Bond film Quantum of Solace.

Reverse stratigraphy (sometimes known as inverted stratigraphy) is the result of a process whereby one sediment is unearthed by human or natural actions and moved elsewhere, whereby the latest material will be deposited on the bottom of the new sediment, and progressively earlier material will be deposited higher and higher in the stratigraphy. Such events can be triggered by rockslides, tree throws, or other events which cause the strata of a deposit to be flipped or reversed. In archeological excavations a common cause of inversions in the stratigraphy is the collapse of walls on river banks or other raised mounds where deposits which have been cut through behind the wall prior to collapse slip over the collapsed structure resulting in the structure being under the deposits that originated earlier in time. In this case care must be taken to re-context the slipped deposits so the event of slippage appears in the correct place stratigraphically in the Harris matrix. There are numerous process that can reverse the stratigraphy or more accurately redeposit it. Many rely on slope processes, however other instances where deposits containing material later than overlying deposits occur in such features as drains or hypocaust systems. In these instances a clear understanding of the direction of \\"UP\\" and site formation processes is essential. Drains or hypocaust systems often have later material deposited within them during their \\"use\\", which may be much much later than either their initial construction or indeed the construction, use and disuse of the floors above them. Other human intervention, such as altering the ground level for architectural purposes by way of filling, can lead to an inversion of the stratigraphic layers.Rowe, J. (1961).

History Buxton Village was founded in 1840 by a group of freed Afro-Guyanese, who purchased the former Plantation Orange Nassau, and named it after Fowell Buxton. Friendship, its sister village, was founded in 1841 after the purchase of Plantation Friendship.\\"Celebrating the 170th Anniversary of the purchase of Buxton Village\\" Buxton: Purchase and Pride, Georgetown, 29 January 1965. The two were later joined to form the village of Buxton-Friendship, which is commonly called Buxton. Buxton Village was founded when a group of 128–132 former slaves from Annandale purchased the 580-acre plantation for 50,000 dollars. The 700-acre Friendship plantation was purchased by 168 former slaves for 80,000 dollars. Buxton, Friendship, Victoria, along with other Guyanese, were all collectively purchased by groups of former slaves after emancipation was enacted in 1838. The Buxton-Friendship local authority was established to interact with plantation owners, in addition to building roads, trenches and other similar infrastructure they also formed an elected village council. In 1856, the British Guiana legislature gave the government the right to enact improvement taxes on the properties of the villagers, this led to a stalemate between the government and the purchasers of Buxton. In 1862, the governor of British Guiana confiscated the property of James Jupiter, Blucher Dorsett, Hector John, Webster Ogle, Chance Bacchus and James Rodney Sr, leading to riots. After the governor refused to hear the complaints of the delegations from Buxton, six village leaders set sail for England to air their grievances to the Queen. After arriving in Barbados, the Barbadian governor met with the delegation and advised his counterpart to absolve their properties of tax duties. This betrayal upset the other villagers, it also threatened the well- being of the members of the delegation who claimed they were not aware of the contents of the letter. In another effort to settle this dispute, some villagers led by Nana Culley decided to blocked the train carrying the governor, and force him to listen to their grievances. With his train surrounded by angry villagers, the governor promised that Buxtonians would be exempt from these levies. During the pre-independence period, Buxton- Friendship was the site of some ethnic violence, including the two murders \\"REPORT OF THE WISMAR, CHRISTIANBURG AND MACKENZIE COMMISSION\\" The Wismar Commission Report, Georgetown, 29 January 1965. that are blamed for triggering the Wismar Massacre, most of the East Indian population of Buxton moved to the nearby villages of Annandale and Lusignan.Fitzroy “Rollo” Younge, \\"Buxton- Friendship, Guyana's Premier Village\\", BuxtonGuyana.net.

Agriculture Buxton sits on very fertile land which is surrounded by an irrigation system (trenches). Local farmers produce a variety of fruits and vegetables including peas, beans, Dakar (Tamarind) and the Buxton Spice mango. This mango is unique to Buxton being fleshy and sweet like others but having a unique spicy taste. There are a variety of fish in the water including the Tilapia.

Valentine and the Artist, oil on canvas, William James Hubard, 1852. Collection of The Valentine The Valentine is a museum in Richmond, Virginia dedicated to collecting, preserving and interpreting Richmond's history. Founded by Mann S. Valentine II 1898, it was the first museum in Richmond. The Valentine offers rotating exhibitions, walking tours, programs, special events, research opportunities and more as a way to engage, educate and challenge a diverse audience. The Valentine also includes the Wickham House, a National Historical Landmark. History =Meat juice fortune and beginnings= Funds for the original museum artifacts came from wealth amassed selling Valentine's Meat Juice. The funds for the museum were provided by Mann S. Valentine II, who made his fortune with Valentine's Meat Juice, a health tonic made from beef juice invented as early as 1870. Mann and his sons earned their fortune from the Valentine Meat Juice Company. During the late 19th century, the Valentines began to collect in the fields of archaeology, anthropology, fine arts and decorative arts. Mann laid the foundation for the museum in 1892; when he died in 1893, he provided the original bequest for the Valentine Museum, leaving his collection of art and artifacts, the 1812 John Wickham House and a $50,000 endowment. Their collection of art and artifacts was the foundation of the exhibitions, when the Valentine Museum opened in 1898. When it opened, the Valentine Museum became the first private museum in the City of Richmond. Mann S. Valentine II's brother Edward Virginius Valentine also had an interest in history and was a well-known sculptor. Edward Valentine served as the museum's first president from the opening until his death in 1930. According to the museum website, Edward Valentine left a large collection of sculpture, papers, furniture and memorabilia to the museum in his will. The Valentine acquired a collection of Richmomd photographs from George S. Cook and Huestis Pratt Cook when they were found in the attic of the home of the latter's widow.https://m.styleweekly.com/richmond/behind-the-cook- studio/Content?oid=14892756 =Evolution of Richmond's oldest museum= In 1924, the museum asked Charleston Museum director Laura Bragg to consult on a reorganization, which got under way four years later.Allen, Louise Anderson. A Bluestocking in Charleston: The Life and Career of Laura Bragg. University of South Carolina Press, 2001. It was the museum's first major renovation and expansion, and as part of the process the museum purchased three rowhouses adjacent to the Wickham House for the purposes of holding artifacts. The museum then renovated the Wickham house to reflect the circa 1812 period when the first owner, John Wickham and his family lived there. On May 20, 1969, the Virginia Historic Landmarks Commission nominated The Valentine Museum buildings to be on the National Register of Historic Places based on the 1966 National Historic Preservation Act. The Valentine Museum received this designation on June 11, 1969.National Register of Historic Places listings in Richmond, Virginia contains the date June 11, 1969 as well as the reference number #69000329 In the 1970s, a major renovation and expansion was undertaken to add a new wing to accommodate more artifacts and increase exhibition space for the public. The Row Houses that served as the primary museum's space were renovated and expanded as well. In 1985, The Valentine hired Frank Jewell and took steps to revitalize the institution and focus on issues such as racism, the southern black experience and the city's complicated history, gaining national attention as a result. In 1988, the Museum worked with Mary Tyler McGraw, formerly of the Afro-American Communities project at the National Museum of American History to develop an exhibit called \\"In Bondage and Freedom\\", engaging scholars with knowledge of social and African-American history. In August 2014, the museum changed its name to The Valentine and adopted the subtitle \\"Richmond Stories.\\" In October of that same year, The Valentine completed renovations to its public exhibition galleries. The renovations featured more accessible gallery spaces, a new education center, lobby and multi-purpose room. In July 2015, The Valentine took over management of The Valentine First Freedom Center.Brent Baldwin. Valentine Museum to Take Over First Freedom Center (Opening and commemoration of historic site for Friday, Jan. 16.) Style Weekly Magazine, Jan 9, 2015. Permanent exhibition - This is Richmond, Virginia The Valentine's permanent exhibition, entitled \\"This is Richmond, Virginia\\", is on display on the main level and tells the story of Virginia's Capital City according to five distinct themes. The objects on display are a part of The Valentine's extensive collection and use diverse personal stories to tell the larger history of this ever-evolving region. Richmond History Tours In the fall of 1942, The Valentine and historic preservation champion Mary Wingfield Scott launched a series of walking tours exploring Richmond. These early walking tours brought Richmond citizens together to explore their city, visiting areas such as Gamble's Hill, Church Hill, Oregon Hill, Jackson Ward and Hollywood Cemetery. Today, the museum continues Scott's work by providing Richmonders the opportunity to explore the city by foot, bus and bike, with the goal of sharing diverse, inclusive stories by exploring the ever-changing urban landscape. The Valentine offers nearly 450 tours a year. Weekly tours cover Hollywood Cemetery, Downtown Richmond and Shockoe Bottom, and each month between March and October is dedicated to a different historic Richmond neighborhood. Specialty tours are also offered, including the history of Richmond and the James River, a walk through the Broad Street Arts District and an exploration of Carytown's LGBTQ+ history. Rotating exhibitions The Valentine has several rotating exhibitions that include photographs, clothes and textiles and historical based exhibits that impacted Richmond in a significant way. * A History of Richmond in 50 Objects, opened on February 14, 2014 in the Massey Gallery located on the main floor of the museum. * History Ink: The Tattoo Archive Project, opened on November 2, 2012 and closed on March 31, 2013, focuses on the rising popularity of tattoos in American culture and locally in Richmond. *The Waste Not, Want Not: Richmond's Great Depression, 1929-1941, exhibition was on display from October 2009 until September 2010. It demonstrated life in Richmond during the Great Depression. *In February 2011, the museum invited the public to submit original captions for up to 100 random images from The Valentine's Richmond Times-Dispatch Collection. The winning captions appeared alongside their respective photos, along with the actual captions that ran in the Richmond newspapers. This exhibition was on display at The Valentine and the Richmond Times-Dispatch until September 2011. *In 2011, The Inaugural Gowns of Virginia's First Ladies displayed nine gowns worn at inaugural balls or receptions held in honor of the new Virginia Governor.

He is regarded as Australia's first self-made millionaire. His name became a byword for reticence, wealth and astute dealing. Early life James Tyson was born about 1820 in the Camden district (then called Cowpastures) of New South Wales, the son of William Tyson and Isabella Marie (née Coulsen). There is disagreement over the date of his birth. Some sources say 11 April 1823 while others say 8 April 1819.Denholm, Z. Tyson, James (1819–1898), Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 6, Melbourne University Press, 1976, pp 319–320. At his death in 1898, he was described as being either 75 years of age or 81 years of age, suggesting an even wider range of possible birth dates. His mother, Isabella, was a convict, sentenced to transportation for theft. His father, William, and his eldest brother, also William, came with her. Receiving a grant from Governor Lachlan Macquarie in the Narellan area, the Tysons set themselves up as small farmers, later moving with their growing family to East Bargo. As a youth James commenced work for neighbours such as Major Thomas Mitchell, and John Buckland who contracted him to take cattle to the north-eastern border area of the colony of Victoria. Then, with his brothers, he took up squatting licences in western New South Wales. Eventually they settled on land at the junction of the Lachlan and Murrumbidgee Rivers, in the reed-beds which had defeated John Oxley's exploration in 1837. Business life The legendary Tyson fortune was founded on success in butchering on the Bendigo goldfields. It was extended by canny buying, knowledge of cattle and of stockroutes, pastoral lending and the judicious selection of enormous leaseholds to provide a chain of supply which stretched from North Queensland to Gippsland and which fed beef to Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. In 1866 he purchased a group of pastoral runs: Wooroorooka, Rottenrow, Gordonsheet and Teckulman, all on the Warrego River and its tributary, Cuttaburra Creek. It is on record that on one occasion he offered the Queensland government a loan of £500,000 towards the cost of constructing a proposed transcontinental railway. In 1892 at a time of economic depression he took up £250,000 in treasury bills to assist the government. Politics In 1893 he became a Member of the Queensland Legislative Council but did not take a prominent part in its proceedings. Link with Flora Shaw Enid Moberly Bell (1947:124–126) recounts a chance meeting between Tyson and Flora Shaw on a long train journey: although vastly different in background, they had \\"a fundamental agreement on values – indifference to wealth, delight in adventure, satisfaction in work accomplished ...\\" – see E.M.Bell (1947) Flora Shaw: Lady Lugard, D.B.E. Constable. Death Slow of speech, though astute and perceptive, \\"Jimmy\\" Tyson habitually dressed like a tradesman or boundary rider, and when he visited his various properties, he did so anonymously, preferring the swagmen's camp and the company of sundowners to the comfort of the manager's homestead. Tyson travelled much about Australia, but eventually made his principal home at Felton station on the Darling Downs. He died there on 4 December 1898. He had been ailing for two weeks but refused to see a doctor. His funeral service was held at St James's Church at Toowoomba and he was buried in Toowoomba Cemetery. At the time of his death his estate was the largest in Australia to that time. However he died unmarried, childless and intestate. His estate was sold off, realising about £2.36 million, which was divided among his closest relatives. In 1901, his remains were exhumed and re- buried in a family vault at St Peter's Anglican Church in Campbelltown, New South Wales; Legacy *Banjo Paterson (in T.Y.S.O.N.), Breaker Morant and Will Ogilvie all wrote about him.  Awards  In 2010, the Hon James Tyson MLC was inducted into the Queensland Business Leaders Hall of Fame, as Australia's first cattle king.

It lived during the Late Triassic period (Norian to Rhaetian stages) in what is now La Rioja Province, Argentina. It is known from the holotype PVL 5904, nearly complete skull. It was discovered and collected from the upper section of the Los Colorados Formation of the Ischigualasto-Villa Unión Basin.  Description  Originally named Coloradia by Jose F.

Publication history Henry Camp first appeared in The Defenders #17 (November 1974) and was created by Len Wein and Sal Buscema. Marci Camp first appeared in Fantastic Four (vol. 5) #3-4. She was created by James Robinson and Leonard Kirk. Fictional character biography =Henry Camp= Henry Camp was born in Topeka, Kansas. He was a Master Sergeant in the United States Army before being dishonorably discharged. Soon after, he entered a life of crime and was later caught and sent to Ryker's Island Prison. He then became cellmates with Dirk Garthwaite, also known as the Wrecker. Garthwaite, together with Camp and two other inmates at Ryker's Island Prison, Dr. Eliot Franklin and Brian Phillip Calusky, made a successful jailbreak and managed to locate his enchanted crowbar. Willing to share his power with his allies, The Wrecker had the three other convicts join him in holding onto the crowbar outside during an electrical storm. Lightning struck the crowbar, magically distributing the enchanted strength bestowed upon the Wrecker among the four of them. The Wrecker's three allies then adopted costumes and aliases as well: Franklin became Thunderball, Calusky became Piledriver, and Henry Camp became Bulldozer, constructing a special metal helmet for the occasion. Together, the four superhumanly strong criminals became known as the Wrecking Crew, who were led by the Wrecker himself. The Wrecking Crew broke out of prison and battled the Defenders while attempting to locate the gamma bomb.Defenders #17-19 With the Wrecking Crew, Bulldozer next battled Captain America and Iron Fist while trying to lure Thor into battle.Iron Fist #11-12 The Wrecking Crew then did battle Thor.Thor #304 The Wrecking Crew were among the various criminals taken to the Beyonder's Battleworld, including a number of super-powered criminals and superheroes. Bulldozer got the opportunity to face off against the Avengers, X-Men, Fantastic Four, and other superheroes. However, he and the rest of the Crew were soundly outmatched by the She-Hulk on one occasion.Marvel Super-Heroes Secret Wars #1-12 The Wrecking Crew next battled Spider-Man and Spider-Woman II.Spectacular Spider-Man #125 Along with the Wrecking Crew, Bulldozer next joined the fourth Masters of Evil, which attacked and took over Avengers Mansion. Bulldozer helped defeat the god Hercules in combat, but was drained of his superhuman powers by Thor.Avengers #273-277 He was freed from prison by the Wrecker, but without his superhuman powers he was defeated by Spider-Man and Spider-Woman.Spectacular Spider-Man #126 With the Wrecking Crew, Camp freed the Wrecker and Ulik from prison. He regained his powers, and battled Hercules, Thor, Excalibur, Code: Blue, and the Ghost Rider. His powers were then again drained by Loki.Thor #418, 426-430 One of Bulldozer's more recent defeats came at the hands of the group known as the Runaways. This was during a rare bank job in Los Angeles, usually avoided by all supervillains as the Pride controlled that area for a time. Unlike Thunderball, Bulldozer has remained steadfast in his loyalty to the Wrecker and has only been separated from the Wrecking Crew through various incarcerations in prison. The Hood has hired him as part of his criminal organization to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act. He helps them fight the New Avengers but is taken down by Doctor Strange. Bulldozer later helps the Hood in fighting against the Skrulls.Secret Invasion #6 He joins with the Hood's gang in an attack on the New Avengers, who were expecting the Dark Avengers instead.New Avengers #50 Bulldozer was mentioned to have died from an unknown cause and his daughter Marci becomes the second Bulldozer.Fantastic Four (vol. 5) #4 During the Avengers: Standoff! storyline, Bulldozer turned up alive as one of the inmates of Pleasant Hill, a gated community established by S.H.I.E.L.D.Captain America: Sam Wilson #7 During the \\"Search for Tony Stark\\" story arc, Bulldozer and the Wrecking Crew rejoin Hood's gang as they attack Castle Doom. Bulldozer is defeated by Doctor Doom in his Iron Man armor.Invincible Iron Man #597. Marvel Comics. =Marci Camp= Marci Camp is the daughter of Henry Camp. After her father had supposedly died from an unknown cause, Marci became the second Bulldozer. As Bulldozer, Marci joins up with the Wizard's Frightful Four, where they attacked the Fantastic Four at Times Square under the orders of a mysterious benefactor.Fantastic Four (vol. 5) #3 Marci and the rest of the Frightful Four are defeated by the Fantastic Four and arrested by S.H.I.E.L.D. Powers and abilities Due to exposure from the Asgardian magic in the Wrecker's crowbar, Henry Camp possesses superhuman strength and a high degree of imperviousness to harm. He can withstand high amounts of concussive force, and is virtually bulletproof. Bulldozer's power augmented his entire body, strengthening his bone, muscle, and flesh. Because of his particular talent (head-butting and ramming), he has greater strength in his neck, shoulders, and legs than the other members of the Wrecking Crew, with the exception of the Wrecker. His superhuman abilities are currently four times greater than when he originally shared the Wrecker's power, making him somewhat stronger than an average well-trained Asgardian god.Damage Control (vol. 2) #1 Bulldozer has a specially-made armored helmet, neck and shoulder apparatus that gives him added protection and invulnerability when ramming an opponent. The helmet partially affects his peripheral field-of-vision. He appears to have used several different versions of the helmet, varying from a simple skullcap to something akin to the Juggernaut's helmet. Bulldozer has basic U.S. Army training in hand-to-hand combat, though now he usually relies on butting with his helmeted head. Marci Camp has the same powers as her father, but not at the same level as him.

It was a basal iguanodontian that lived during the Late Jurassic period (Kimmeridgian age) in what is now Oxfordshire, United Kingdom. Description The holotype of Cumnoria is of a rather small bipedal animal with a slender build. about 3.5 metres (11.4 feet) long, The specimen is probably that of a juvenile though. Reconstruction History of discovery Cumnoria is known from the holotype OXFUM J.3303, a partial skull and postcranium, recovered from the lower Kimmeridge Clay Formation, in the Chawley Brick Pits, Cumnor Hurst. Workers at first discarded the remains on a dump heap, but one of them later collected the bones in a sack and showed them to Professor George Rolleston, an anatomist at the nearby Oxford University. Rolleston in turn brought them to the attention of palaeontologist Professor Joseph Prestwich who in 1879 reported them as a new species of Iguanodon, though without actually coining a species name. In 1880 Prestwich published an article on the geological stratigraphy of the find. The same year John Whitaker Hulke named the species Iguanodon prestwichii, the specific epithet honouring Prestwich. In 1888, Harry Govier Seeley decided the taxon represented a new and separate genus which he named Cumnoria after Cumnor, the village where it was discovered. Its type species Iguanodon prestwichii was thus recombined into Cumnoria prestwichii — though Seeley spelled the epithet as prestwichi. The genus was quickly abandoned however: already in 1889 Richard Lydekker assigned the species to Camptosaurus, as Camptosaurus prestwichii. This opinion was generally accepted for over a century. In 1980 Peter Galton provided the first modern description of the species. In 1998 David Norman concluded that Seeley's original generic distinction was valid. In 2008 this was supported by Darren Naish and David Martill. In 2010 and 2011 cladistic analyses by Andrew T. McDonald confirmed this by showing that Cumnoria had a separate phylogenetic position from Camptosaurus dispar. However, in 2015, Uteodon and Cumnoria were synonymized with Camptosaurus, but as distinct species. Classification Camptosaurus prestwichii was traditionally assigned to the Camptosauridae. In the new analyses of McDonald Cumnoria has instead been recovered as a basal member of the Styracosterna, more closely related to more derived (\\"advanced\\") iguanodontians than to Camptosaurus dispar. Cumnoria would then be the oldest known styracostern.

It has been in continuous service to the central San Joaquin Valley since 1896, giving it the distinction of being the first institution of higher education in the area. It awards certificates, and associate's, bachelor's, and master's degrees. Its Humphreys College Laurence Drivon School of Law awards the juris doctor degree. The college is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges and the Accrediting Commission for Senior Colleges and Universities, and the law school is accredited by the California State Bar Committee of Bar Examiners. History Although records show the existence of the school in Stockton going as far back as 1875, Humphreys College dates its founding to 1896 when John R. Humphreys, Sr. took over the administration of the Stockton Business College, Normal School, and Telegraphic Institute. When Humphreys died in 1937, his son, John R. Humphreys, Jr. took over the operation of the school. The name of the school changed several times, at one point known as the \\"Gas City Business College\\" before being taken over in 1901 by the \\"Western School of Commerce\\", which merged with \\"Heald's Business College\\" in 1920 to become the \\"Stockton College of Commerce\\";van Ommeren 2004 however, in 1947, the school incorporated as a non-profit institution of higher learning with the state of California, and took the name that it is known by today.State of California Record of Incorporation Humphreys' main campus in Stockton is located in the North Stockton neighborhood of Sherwood adjacent to Stockton's Lincoln Center shopping area, moving from a downtown location after construction of the facility completed in 1967. In 1987 a new campus was established in Modesto in conjunction with and on the Modesto Junior College campus, later becoming a separate campus at its current location. A Sacramento-area campus opened in 1990, assuming the operation (but not the business) of two closing court reporting colleges, Unilex College and Careercom College of Business; however, under economic pressure of the early 2000s recession and dwindling enrollment this campus closed in 2001. A partnership with the Stockton Unified School District in 2005 produced the Institute of Business Management and Law, a charter high school located in the west campus building complex, graduating its final class in 2011 followed by the subsequent dissolution of the partnership. Also, in 2005, the main campus in Stockton was re-dedicated to the community and underwent a remodel along with a campus expansion, which included new undergraduate and law libraries, faculty and administrative offices, law school building and the Carcione Courtroom, dedicated to the late Joseph Carcione, Sr. by his son, local Stockton attorney Joseph W. Carcione, Jr. In January 2009, after receiving a substantive change approval from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, the college began offering a new graduate program, the Master of Arts in Education with emphases in Early Childhood Education and Educational Administration. In late 2009, with continued increases in enrollment, the college created plans to demolish the former student housing and childcare buildings and expand another , spreading the campus south to Quincy Street with additional parking, classrooms and community space; construction began in March 2010 and was completed in February 2011. The Modesto campus also doubled in capacity during 2010, using adjoining facilities vacated by the departure of the University of Phoenix as enrollment tripled from an all-time low from the 2007 academic year. With the Stockton Unified School District partnership dissolution, a new charter high school was proposed using the existing facilities of the former Institute of Business Management and Law, with an expected September 2011 opening date. The proposal was unanimously rejected by the Lincoln Unified School District in a public board meeting, then subsequently accepted by New Jerusalem School District under its Delta Charter, thus enabling the Academy of Business, Law and Education to open as planned. In September 2013, the college lost eligibility to participate in California state financial aid due to its student loan default rate exceeding the federal standard. Following several quarters of declining enrollment, an exodus of transfer students, and the prior loss of state financial aid, by 2014, the college embarked on a cost- reduction course of action, reducing 25% of employees via attrition, pay-cuts, layoffs and retirement offers – including the serving president, who agreed to step down by the end of the next academic year with his heir accepting the familial role with the uncontested and unanimous approval of the board of trustees.

The station is situated on the A559 road from Northwich to Chester. History Winter scene at Hartford & Greenbank in 1962 The station was built by the West Cheshire Railway, a constituent of the Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC) and opened to passengers on 22 June 1870. The CLC continued to operate both goods and passenger services from the station, unaffected by the railway grouping of 1923, until the railway nationalisation of 1948. The station name was Hartford and Greenbank until 7 May 1973 when British Railways renamed the station Greenbank, to avoid confusion with the nearby station on the West Coast Main Line. Greenbank was served by CLC trains from Manchester Central via Northwich to . From the closure of Manchester Central on 5 May 1969 & Chester Northgate on 6 October that year, trains from Greenbank were diverted to and the LNWR & GWR Joint Chester station, previously Chester General. CLC trains were headed by locomotives in LNER livery. A link to LMS service was made by a shuttle service to using LMS stock (this normally continued via Northwich, Middlewich & to ). This service was nicknamed \\"The Dodger\\", but was withdrawn in 1942. Facilities Greenbank signal box The station is unstaffed (though there is a self-service ticket machine provided) and has a free car park. There is a public phone box opposite the station and a row of shops nearby. The Greenbank public house is next to the station and Mid Cheshire College is about away, with a Sainsbury's store opposite the college. The main station buildings are on the north-west side of the line and are presently used as a Christian church. Waiting shelters are provided on each side and train running details are offered via digital CIS displays, telephone and timetable posters.

Hartford's main station is about one mile (1.6 km) to the west along the main A559 road - a 20-minute journey on foot or 5 minutes by car or taxi. Trains are available from there to Liverpool Lime Street, , Winsford, and Birmingham New Street. Services The service to and from Manchester Piccadilly and Chester on weekdays and Saturdays is basically hourly (with a couple of weekday peak period extras to/from ). On Sundays, the trains run every two hours each way and the eastbound service runs through to Southport via Bolton & Wigan Wallgate. The majority of trains used on the line are Class 142 or Class 150, together with the occasional Class 156.

As the Director of Direct Action and of Nonviolent Education of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), he initiated, strategized, directed, and developed SCLC's three major successes of the era: the 1963 Birmingham Children's Crusade, the 1965 Selma voting rights movement, and the 1966 Chicago open housing movement.Kryn in Garrow, 1989. He suggested that SCLC call for and join a March on Washington in 1963.Kryn in Garrow, 1989, p. 533. Bevel strategized the 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches, which contributed to Congressional passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Prior to his time with SCLC, Bevel worked in the Nashville Student Movement, which conducted the 1960 Nashville Lunch-Counter Sit-Ins, the 1961 Open Theater Movement, and recruited students to continue the 1961 Freedom Rides after they were attacked. He initiated and directed some of the 1961 and 1962 voting rights movement in Mississippi. In 1967, Bevel was chair of the Spring Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam. He initiated the 1967 March on the United Nations as part of the anti-war movement.Kryn, 2005. His last major action was as co-initiator of the 1995 Day of Atonement/Million Man March in Washington, DC. For his work Bevel has been called a father of voting rights, the strategist and architect of the 1960s Civil Rights Movement,Kryn in Garrow, 1989, title & p. 532. and half of the first-tier team that formulated many of the strategies and actions to gain federal legislation and social changes during the 1960s civil rights era. In 2005 Bevel was accused of incest by one of his daughters and abuse by three others. He was tried in April 2008. Bevel was convicted of unlawful fornication; pursuant to the recommendation of the jury, which could have sentenced him to anywhere from 5 to 20 years, he was sentenced to 15 years in prison and fined $50,000. After serving seven months he was freed awaiting an appeal; he died of pancreatic cancer in December 2008. He was buried in Eutaw, Alabama. Early life and education Bevel was born in 1936 in Itta Bena, Mississippi, the son of Illie and Dennis Bevel. He was one of seventeen children. He grew up in rural LeFlore County of the Mississippi Delta and in Cleveland. He worked on a cotton plantation for a time as a youth and later in a steel mill. He was educated at segregated local schools in Mississippi and in Cleveland, Ohio. After high school he served in the U.S. Navy for a time and seemed headed for a career as a singer. Called in a different direction, he attended the American Baptist Theological Seminary in Nashville, Tennessee, from 1957 to 1961, becoming a Baptist preacher. He also joined the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. While at seminary, he reread Leo Tolstoy's The Kingdom of God Is Within You, which had earlier inspired his decision to leave the military. Bevel also read several of Mohandas Gandhi's books and newspapers while taking off-campus workshops on Gandhi's philosophy and nonviolent techniques taught by James Lawson of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Bevel also attended workshops at the Highlander Folk School taught by its founder, Myles Horton, who emphasized grassroots organizing. Nashville Student Movement and SNCC In 1960, along with Lawson's and Horton's students including Bernard Lafayette, John Lewis, Diane Nash and others, Bevel participated in the Nashville Sit-In Movement organized by Nash, whom he would later marry, to desegregate the city's lunch counters and got to know many student leaders. After the success of this action, and with the aid of SCLC's Ella Baker, activist students from Nashville and across the South developed the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). Working on SNCC's commitment to desegregate theaters, Bevel successfully directed the 1961 Nashville Open Theater Movement. At the time the Open Theater Movement had success in Nashville, this was the only city in the country where activists had organized such an action. In this same period, the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) organized the 1961 Freedom Rides through the Deep South to challenge southern state laws and practices that segregated interstate buses and their facilities despite federal laws for equal treatment. After buses and riders were severely attacked, including a firebombing of a bus and beatings with police complicity in Birmingham, Alabama, CORE suspended the rides. Diane Nash, the Nashville Student Movement's chairman, urged the group to continue the Freedom Rides, and called for college volunteers from Fisk and other universities across the South. Bevel selected the student teams for the buses. He and the others were arrested after they arrived in Jackson, Mississippi and tried to desegregate the waiting-rooms in the bus terminal. Eventually the Freedom Riders reached their goal of New Orleans, Louisiana, generating nationwide coverage of the violence to maintain Jim Crow and white supremacy in the South. While in the Jackson jail, Bevel and Bernard Lafayette initiated the Mississippi Voting Rights Movement. They, Nash, and others stayed in Mississippi to work on grassroots organizing. Activists encountered severe violence at that time and retreated to regroup. Later efforts in Mississippi developed as Freedom Summer in 1964, when extensive voter education and registration efforts took place. Lafayette and his wife, Colia Lidell, had also opened a SNCC project in Selma, Alabama, to assist the work of local organizers such as Amelia Boynton. 1962 Bevel/King agreement In 1962, Bevel was invited to meet in Atlanta with Martin Luther King Jr, a minister who was head of the SCLC. At that meeting, which had been suggested by James Lawson, Bevel and King agreed to work together on an equal basis, with neither having veto power over the other, on projects under the auspices of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). They agreed to work until they had ended segregation, obtained voting rights, and ensured that all American children had a quality education. They agreed to continue until they had achieved these goals, and to ask for funding from the SCLC only if the group was involved in organizing a movement.Kryn in Garrow, 1989, pp. 517, 523–24. Bevel soon became SCLC's Director of Direct Action and Director of Nonviolent Education to augment King's positions as SCLC's Chairman and spokesperson. 1963 Birmingham Children's Crusade and the March on Washington As students marched in Birmingham, Alabama, Associated Press photographer Bill Hudson took this well-known image of Parker High School student Walter Gadsden being attacked by dogs. In 1963, SCLC agreed to assist its co-founder, Fred Shuttlesworth, and others in their work on desegregating retail businesses and jobs in Birmingham, Alabama, where discussion and negotiations with city officials had yielded little. Weeks of demonstrations and marches resulted in King, Ralph Abernathy, and Shuttlesworth being arrested and jailed. King wanted to fill the jails with protesters, but it was becoming more difficult to find adults to march. They were severely penalized for missing work and were trying to support their families. Bevel suggested recruiting students in the campaign. King was initially reluctant, but agreed. Bevel spent weeks developing strategy, recruiting and educating students in the philosophy and techniques of nonviolence. Birmingham's 16th Street Baptist Church was a center of the organizing. Bevel directed the students, 50 at a time, to walk to the City Hall to talk to Mayor Art Hanes about segregation in the city. Almost 1,000 students were arrested on the first day. When more arrived to march the following day, Eugene \\"Bull\\" Connor, City Commissioner of Public Safety, ordered that German Shepherd dogs and high-pressure fire hoses be used to stop the children from marching. The national and international media were covering the story, and photographs of the force used against schoolchildren generated public outrage against the city and its officials. During what was called the Birmingham Children's Crusade, President John F. Kennedy asked King to stop using children in the campaign. King told Bevel to refrain from using students. Bevel instead said that he would organize the children to march to Washington D.C. to meet with Kennedy about segregation. King agreed. Bevel went to the children and asked them to prepare to take to the highways for a march on Washington, with the goal of questioning the President about his plans to end segregation in America. hearing of this plan, the Kennedy administration asked SCLC's leaders what they wanted in a comprehensive civil rights bill. Kennedy's staff had drafted one and came to agreement on contents with SCLC's leadership. Bevel agreed to call off the children's march. In August 1963, SCLC participated in what has become known as the March on Washington, an event organized by labor leader A. Philip Randolph and Bayard Rustin, who had planned the earlier 1941 March. Alabama Project and the 1965 Selma Voting Rights Movement march from Selma to Montgomery resulted in \\"Bloody Sunday\\". Protesters later completed a march with federal protection, and thousands of people entered the capital in support of voting rights. In September 1963, a bomb at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham killed four young girls attending Sunday School and damaged the church. It was later proven that a Ku Klux Klan chapter was responsible. Bevel proposed organizing the Alabama Voting Rights Project, and co-wrote the project proposal with his wife Diane Nash. They moved to Alabama to implement the project along with Birmingham student activist James Orange. At the turn of the 20th century, southern state legislatures had passed new constitutions and laws that effectively disenfranchised most blacks. Practices such as requiring payment of poll taxes and literacy tests administered in a discriminatory way by white officials maintained the exclusion of blacks from the political system in the 1960s. SNCC had been conducting a Voting Rights Project (headed by Prathia Hall and Worth Long) since the early 1960s, meeting with violence in Alabama. In late 1963 Bevel, Nash, and Orange also worked with local grassroots organizations to educate blacks and support them in trying to gain registration as voters, but made little progress. They invited King and other SCLC leaders to Selma to develop larger protests and actions. work alongside Bevel's and Nash's Alabama Project Together the groups became collectively known as the Selma Voting Rights Movement, with James Bevel as its director. The Movement began to stage regular marches to the county courthouse, which had limited hours for blacks to register as voters. Some protesters were jailed, but the movement kept the pressure on. On February 16, 1965, Jimmie Lee Jackson, his mother, and grandfather took part in a nighttime march led by C. T. Vivian to protest the related jailing of activist James Orange in Marion, Alabama. The street lights were turned off by Alabama State Troopers who attacked the protesters. In the melee, Jackson was shot in the stomach while defending his mother from an attack. A young man, he died a few days later. Bevel and others were grieved and outraged. He suggested a march from Selma to Montgomery, the capital, to protest Jackson's death and press Governor George Wallace to support voting rights for African Americans. As the first march reached the end of the Edmund Pettus Bridge and passed out of the city, they were attacked by county police and Alabama State Troopers. The large group were bludgeoned and tear-gassed in what became known as \\"Bloody Sunday\\". SNCC Chairman John Lewis and Amelia Boynton were both injured. In March 1965 protesters made a symbolic march, inspired by a fiery speech by Bevel at Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church, where much organizing was done. They were under an injunction by the state, so stayed within the city limits. Organizers appealed to the federal court against an injunction by the state against marching in order to complete their planned march to the capital. Judge Frank Johnson approved a public march. Following the nationwide publicity generated by Jackson's death and the previous attack on peaceful marchers, hundreds of religious, labor and civic leaders, many celebrities, and activists and citizens of many ethnicities traveled to Selma to join the march. By the time they entered Montgomery 54 miles away, the marchers were thousands strong. Even before the final march occurred, President Lyndon Johnson had gone on national television to address a joint session of Congress, appealing for passage of his administration-backed comprehensive Voting Rights Act. In 1965 SCLC gave its highest honor, the Rosa Parks Award, to James Bevel and Diane Nash for their work on the Alabama Voting Rights Project. 1966 Chicago open housing movement and the Anti-Vietnam War Movement In 1966, Bevel chose Chicago as the site of SCLC's long-awaited Northern Campaign.Kryn in Garrow, 1989, pp. 521-22. He worked to create tenant unions and build grassroots action to \\"end\\" slums. From previous discussions with King, and from work of American Friends Service Committee activist Bill Moyer, Bevel organized, and directed the Chicago open housing movement. Housing in the area was segregated in a de facto way, enforced by covenants and real estate practices. This movement ended within a Summit Conference that included Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley. As the Chicago movement neared its conclusion A. J. Muste, David Dellinger, representatives of North Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh, and others asked Bevel to take over the directorship of the Spring Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam.Kryn in Garrow, 1989, pp. 533-34. Bevel was influential in gaining King's support for the anti-war movement. Bevel agreed to lead the antiwar effort. He renamed the organization the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam, recruited members of many diverse groups, and organized the April 15, 1967 march from Central Park to the United Nations Building in New York City. Originally planned as a rally in Central Park, the United Nations Anti-Vietnam War March became the largest demonstration in American history to that date. During his speech to the crowd that day, Bevel called for a larger march in Washington D.C., a plan that evolved into the October 1967 March on the Pentagon. This rally was attended by tens of thousands of peace activists who followed the growing counterculture movement.\\"The Day The Pentagon Was Supposed To Lift Off Into Space\\" , American Heritage magazine, 21 October 2005, Accessed September 15, 2014. Martin Luther King's assassination Bevel witnessed King's assassination on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee. He reminded SCLC's executive board and staff that evening that King had left \\"marching orders\\" that, if anything should happen to him, he intended for Abernathy to take his place as SCLC's Chairman.Kryn in Garrow, 1989, p. 524. Bevel opposed SCLC's next action, the 1968 Poor People's Campaign, but served as its Director of Nonviolent Education. Some time after that, he left the SCLC. After King was assassinated Bevel made a claim, described by the New York Times as bizarre, that James Earl Ray was not the killer and that he had evidence that Ray was innocent. Bevel would not reveal the evidence, and Ray was convicted of the crime. Working with Moon and LaRouche In the 1980s, Bevel appeared to move to the right and supported Ronald Reagan as president. He lost as the Republican candidate for Illinois' 7th Congressional District in 1984. In 1989, Bevel and Abernathy organized the National Committee Against Religious Bigotry and Racism. This was financially backed by the Unification Church of Sun Myung Moon, which appeared to be trying to improve its controversial image by allying with such respected leaders. A year earlier, Bevel had denounced the deprogramming of a Moon follower and called for the protection of religious rights. Bevel moved to Omaha, Nebraska, in November 1990 as the leader of the \\"Citizens Fact-Finding Commission to Investigate Human Rights Violations of Children in Nebraska\\", a group organized by the Schiller Institute. The commission was associated with conspiracy theorist Lyndon LaRouche, and sought to persuade the state legislature to reopen its two-year investigation into the Franklin child prostitution ring allegations. Bevel never submitted the collected petitions and left the state the following summer. In 1992, Bevel ran on LaRouche's ticket as the vice presidential candidate. At the time, he was living and working in Leesburg, Virginia, near LaRouche's headquarters. LaRouche, characterized as a perennial candidate, was serving a prison sentence for mail fraud and tax evasion. He engaged in LaRouche seminars on issues including \\"Is the Anti Defamation League the new KKK?\\"LaRouche Connection Master List 1991-1995 When Bevel introduced LaRouche at a convention of the 1996 National African American Leadership Summit, both men were booed off the stage. A fight broke out between LaRouche supporters and black nationalists. Criminal charges In May 2007, Bevel was arrested in Alabama on charges of incest committed sometime between October 1992 and October 1994 in Loudoun County, Virginia. At the time, Bevel was living in Leesburg, Virginia, and working with LaRouche's group, whose international headquarters was a few blocks from Bevel's apartment. The accuser was one of his daughters, who was 13–15 years old at the time and lived with him. At a family reunion, three other daughters had also alleged that Bevel sexually abused them. Charged with one count of unlawful fornication in Virginia, which has no statute of limitations for incest, Bevel pleaded not guilty and maintained his innocence of incest. During his four-day trial in 2008 the accusing daughter testified that she was repeatedly molested by him, beginning when she was six years old. During the trial, prosecutors presented key evidence: a 2005 police-sting telephone call recorded by the Leesburg police without Bevel's knowledge. During that 90-minute call, Bevel's daughter asked him why he had sex with her the one time in 1993, and she asked him why he wanted her to use a vaginal douche afterward. Bevel said that he had no interest in getting her pregnant. At trial, Bevel denied committing the sexual act and his recorded statement was used against him. On April 10, 2008, after a three-hour deliberation, the jury convicted Bevel of incest. His bond was revoked and he was taken into custody. On October 15, 2008, the judge sentenced him to 15 years in prison and fined him $50,000. After the verdict, Bevel claimed that the charges were part of a conspiracy to destroy his reputation, and said that he might appeal. He received an appeal bond on November 4, 2008, and was released from jail three days later, after a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Six weeks later he died of cancer, at the age of 72, in Springfield, Virginia. Bevel's attorney requested that the Court of Appeals of Virginia abate the conviction (which would have cleared Bevel's name) on account of his death. The Court of Appeals remanded the case to the trial court to determine whether there was good cause not to abate the conviction. The trial court found that abating the conviction would deny the victim the closure that she sought and denied the motion to abate. The Court of Appeals affirmed this judgment. Bevel's attorney appealed the denial of the abatement motion to the Supreme Court of Virginia. In an opinion issued November 4, 2011, the state's Supreme Court held that abatement of criminal convictions was not available in Virginia under the circumstances of Bevel's case. Because the executor of Bevel's estate had not sought to prosecute the appeal, the Court affirmed the conviction. Marriage and family Bevel was married in 1961 to activist Diane Nash after he completed his seminary studies. They worked together on civil rights, and had a daughter and son together. They divorced after seven years. He married three other women in the following decades, and had told the court during his incest case that he had 16 children born of seven women. In popular culture Actor and rapper Common portrays Bevel in the 2014 film Selma.

The station has two platforms and is located on the Mid-Cheshire line southwest of Manchester Piccadilly. History The first railway to reach the town was the Cheshire Midland Railway (CMR) route from , which opened to traffic on 1 January 1863. The CMR was one of the constituent routes of the Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC) from its formation, and the WCR was built by the CLC. The original CMR terminus station in Northwich was likely the building that became the goods station but was replaced early, in 1869, as the continuing line towards Hartford was being constructed as part of the West Cheshire Railway (WCR). Further lines to via Middlewich (opened in November 1867 by the London and North Western Railway), Helsby (the West Cheshire Railway, opened in 1869) and a short goods branch to Winnington (also opened in 1869) would complete the network of routes serving the area, with being served from May 1875. As a result, Northwich station was served by no fewer than four different pre-grouping railway companies. The LNWR also operated a number of its Sandbach & Crewe trains forward from here to via Greenbank and the curve down to the West Coast Main Line at Hartford Junction. The station expanded as the railway grew and by 1910 there were three platform faces, a bay for loading cattle, extensive goods sidings with a five ton crane and a goods station. The CMR built a two-lane engine shed and turntable in 1869, the shed was doubled in size in 1877 and rebuilt around 1948 before closing to steam engines in 1968 and diesel in 1982. D10 'Director' 4-4-0 No. 2652 'Edwin A. Beazley' stands beside a water-column at Northwich Depot, situated next to the Cheshire Lines (CLC) station Services were available to a variety of destinations, in 1872 most of the services were mainly local with nine daily trains each way to Manchester, both via the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway (MSJAR) and via , , through services were available to Derby and London St Pancras. Additional destinations were gradually added as they became available including Chester, Liverpool Central, Manchester Central, Sheffield and London Kings Cross. Following the 1923 Grouping, Northwich remained a joint station (the CLC being jointly vested in the LNER & LMS and the LMS taking over the Sandbach branch trains). Services to Acton Bridge ended during World War 2, but the primary routes to Chester, Crewe & Manchester continued in use up to and after nationalisation in January 1948 (when they became part of the London Midland Region of British Railways). B.R withdrew passenger services from the Sandbach line and closed station on 4 January 1960 - thereafter the outer face of the southern island platform at the station fell out of use, though the branch itself has continued in use for freight traffic and periodic passenger diversions.Disused Stations - MddlewichDisused Stations Site Record; Retrieved 13 November 2016 Services on the main Manchester to Chester route would continue, but from 1969 both terminals for this service would change following the closure of Manchester Central station on 5 May and Chester Northgate on 6 October that year. Trains henceforth ran to eastbound and to the former GWR & LNWR Joint station at Chester General westbound. Since 1990 though, Manchester-bound trains have been diverted beyond Altrincham to run via Northenden & Stockport to reach Manchester Piccadilly as the former route via Sale is now part of the Metrolink tram network. Facilities The main buildings on the Manchester- bound platform are still in use, with the ticket office open six days per week from early morning until early afternoon (Monday-Friday 06:15-13:30, Saturdays 07:15-14:30). Two self-service ticket machines are also provided for use outside these times and for collecting advance purchase tickets. The remaining parts of the building are used as a cafe and community centre. A waiting shelter is provided on the Chester-bound side (platform 2), whilst train running details are offered via CIS displays and timetable posters. Step-free access is only possible from the main entrance to platform 1, as platform 2 access is via a stepped footbridge.Northwich station facilities National Rail Enquiries Services Monday to Saturday there is an hourly service westbound to Chester and eastbound to Manchester Piccadilly (with a couple of peak hour extras ending at or starting from ). On Sundays there is now a two-hourly service to Chester and Manchester, with the latter continuing to Wigan Wallgate and Southport. Through trains to Manchester had not previously operated on Sundays since the early 1990s, passenger instead having to change at Altrincham onto the Manchester Metrolink to continue their journeys to Manchester. Proposed future developments The Northern Hub proposes an additional hourly service to run between Greenbank and Stockport. Re-instating the passenger service between Northwich and Sandbach has been proposed. This would allow direct trains to Crewe from Knutsford, giving a better connection to the Midlands and the South of England.Network Rail - MCRUA response to North West RUS Consultation Retrieval Date: 18 July 2007. Proposals for a direct link to Manchester Airport from Northwich were first put forward in the 1990s, not much had seemed to materialise from this. However, in 2009 Network Rail stated that the creation of the third platform has meant that the capacity at Manchester airport will become constrained by the layover of the trains and congestion at the throat. To solve this issue they have recommended building a line underneath the Airport towards Northwich in the 2019 to 2024 period. The running of tram-trains directly in to Manchester, in addition to the existing rail service, has been estimated as being able to cut about 10 minutes off the overall journey time to and from Manchester. Network Rail and the Department for Transport (DfT) have indicated that they are keen to carry out a trial for tram-trains in the UK, which will be between Rotherham and Sheffield. Carrying out the trial would provide the information Network Rail and the DfT require on reliability, frequency and costs.

In addition to this long established metabolic function, GAPDH has recently been implicated in several non-metabolic processes, including transcription activation, initiation of apoptosis, ER to Golgi vesicle shuttling, and fast axonal, or axoplasmic transport. In sperm, a testis-specific isoenzyme GAPDHS is expressed.  Structure  Under normal cellular conditions, cytoplasmic GAPDH exists primarily as a tetramer. This form is composed of four identical 37-kDa subunits containing a single catalytic thiol group each and critical to the enzyme's catalytic function. Nuclear GAPDH has increased isoelectric point (pI) of pH 8.3–8.7. Of note, the cysteine residue C152 in the enzyme's active site is required for the induction of apoptosis by oxidative stress. Notably, post-translational modifications of cytoplasmic GAPDH contribute to its functions outside of glycolysis. GAPDH is encoded by a single gene that produces a single mRNA transcript with 8 splice variants, though an isoform does exist as a separate gene that is expressed only in spermatozoa.  Reaction  = Two-step conversion of G3P = The first reaction is the oxidation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) at the position-1 (in the diagram it is shown as the 4th carbon from glycolysis), in which an aldehyde is converted into a carboxylic acid (ΔG°'=-50 kJ/mol (−12kcal/mol)) and NAD+ is simultaneously reduced endergonically to NADH. The energy released by this highly exergonic oxidation reaction drives the endergonic second reaction (ΔG°'=+50 kJ/mol (+12kcal/mol)), in which a molecule of inorganic phosphate is transferred to the GAP intermediate to form a product with high phosphoryl- transfer potential: 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3-BPG). This is an example of phosphorylation coupled to oxidation, and the overall reaction is somewhat endergonic (ΔG°'=+6.3 kJ/mol (+1.5)). Energy coupling here is made possible by GAPDH. = Mechanism = GAPDH uses covalent catalysis and general base catalysis to decrease the very large activation energy of the second step (phosphorylation) of this reaction. 1: Oxidation First, a cysteine residue in the active site of GAPDH attacks the carbonyl group of GAP, creating a hemithioacetal intermediate (covalent catalysis). The hemithioacetal is deprotonated by a histidine residue in the enzyme's active site (general base catalysis). Deprotonation encourages the reformation of the carbonyl group in the subsequent thioester intermediate and ejection of a hydride ion. Next, an adjacent, tightly bound molecule of NAD+ accepts the hydride ion, forming NADH while the hemithioacetal is oxidized to a thioester. This thioester species is much higher in energy (less stable) than the carboxylic acid species that would result if GAP were oxidized in the absence of GAPDH (the carboxylic acid species is so low in energy that the energy barrier for the second step of the reaction (phosphorylation) would be too high, and the reaction, therefore, too slow and unfavorable for a living organism). 2: Phosphorylation NADH leaves the active site and is replaced by another molecule of NAD+, the positive charge of which stabilizes the negatively charged carbonyl oxygen in the transition state of the next and ultimate step. Finally, a molecule of inorganic phosphate attacks the thioester and forms a tetrahedral intermediate, which then collapses to release 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate, and the thiol group of the enzyme's cysteine residue. = Regulation = This protein may use the morpheein model of allosteric regulation.  Function  = Metabolic = As its name indicates, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) catalyses the conversion of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to D-glycerate 1,3-bisphosphate. This is the 6th step in the glycolytic breakdown of glucose, an important pathway of energy and carbon molecule supply which takes place in the cytosol of eukaryotic cells. The conversion occurs in two coupled steps. The first is favourable and allows the second unfavourable step to occur. = Transcription and apoptosis = GAPDH can itself activate transcription. The OCA-S transcriptional coactivator complex contains GAPDH and lactate dehydrogenase, two proteins previously only thought to be involved in metabolism. GAPDH moves between the cytosol and the nucleus and may thus link the metabolic state to gene transcription. In 2005, Hara et al. showed that GAPDH initiates apoptosis. This is not a third function, but can be seen as an activity mediated by GAPDH binding to DNA like in transcription activation, discussed above. The study demonstrated that GAPDH is S-nitrosylated by NO in response to cell stress, which causes it to bind to the protein SIAH1, a ubiquitin ligase. The complex moves into the nucleus where Siah1 targets nuclear proteins for degradation, thus initiating controlled cell shutdown. In subsequent study the group demonstrated that deprenyl, which has been used clinically to treat Parkinson's disease, strongly reduces the apoptotic action of GAPDH by preventing its S-nitrosylation and might thus be used as a drug. = Metabolic switch = GAPDH acts as a reversible metabolic switch under oxidative stress. When cells are exposed to oxidants, they need excessive amounts of the antioxidant cofactor NADPH. In the cytosol, NADPH is reduced from NADP+ by several enzymes, three of them catalyze the first steps of the Pentose phosphate pathway. Oxidant-treatments cause an inactivation of GAPDH. This inactivation re-routes temporally the metabolic flux from glycolysis to the Pentose Phosphate Pathway, allowing the cell to generate more NADPH. Under stress conditions, NADPH is needed by some antioxidant-systems including glutaredoxin and thioredoxin as well as being essential for the recycling of gluthathione. = ER to Golgi transport = GAPDH also appears to be involved in the vesicle transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus which is part of shipping route for secreted proteins. It was found that GAPDH is recruited by rab2 to the vesicular-tubular clusters of the ER where it helps to form COP 1 vesicles. GAPDH is activated via tyrosine phosphorylation by Src. = Additional functions = GAPDH, like many other enzymes, has multiple functions. In addition to catalysing the 6th step of glycolysis, recent evidence implicates GAPDH in other cellular processes. GAPDH has been described to exhibit higher order multifunctionality in the context of maintaining cellular iron homeostasis, specifically as a chaperone protein for labile heme within cells. This came as a surprise to researchers but it makes evolutionary sense to re-use and adapt existing proteins instead of evolving a novel protein from scratch.  Use as loading control  Because the GAPDH gene is often stably and constitutively expressed at high levels in most tissues and cells, it is considered a housekeeping gene. For this reason, GAPDH is commonly used by biological researchers as a loading control for western blot and as a control for qPCR. However, researchers have reported different regulation of GAPDH under specific conditions. For example, the transcription factor MZF-1 has been shown to regulate the GAPDH gene. Hypoxia also strongly upregulates GAPDH. Therefore, the use of GAPDH as loading control has to be considered carefully.  Cellular distribution  All steps of glycolysis take place in the cytosol and so does the reaction catalysed by GAPDH. In red blood cells, GAPDH and several other glycolytic enzymes assemble in complexes on the inside of the cell membrane. The process appears to be regulated by phosphorylation and oxygenation. Bringing several glycolytic enzymes close to each other is expected to greatly increase the overall speed of glucose breakdown. Recent studies have also revealed that GAPDH is expressed in an iron dependent fashion on the exterior of the cell membrane a where it plays a role in maintenance of cellular iron homeostasis.  Clinical significance  = Cancer = GAPDH is overexpressed in multiple human cancers, such as cutaneous melanoma, and its expression is positively correlated with tumor progression. Its glycolytic and antiapoptotic functions contribute to proliferation and protection of tumor cells, promoting tumorigenesis. Notably, GAPDH protects against telomere shortening induced by chemotherapeutic drugs that stimulate the sphingolipid ceramide. Meanwhile, conditions like oxidative stress impair GAPDH function, leading to cellular aging and death. Moreover, depletion of GAPDH has managed to induce senescence in tumor cells, thus presenting a novel therapeutic strategy for controlling tumor growth. = Neurodegeneration = GAPDH has been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases and disorders, largely through interactions with other proteins specific to that disease or disorder. These interactions may affect not only energy metabolism but also other GAPDH functions. For example, GAPDH interactions with beta-amyloid precursor protein (betaAPP) could interfere with its function regarding the cytoskeleton or membrane transport, while interactions with huntingtin could interfere with its function regarding apoptosis, nuclear tRNA transport, DNA replication, and DNA repair. In addition, nuclear translocation of GAPDH has been reported in Parkinson's disease (PD), and several anti-apoptotic PD drugs, such as rasagiline, function by preventing the nuclear translocation of GAPDH. It is proposed that hypometabolism may be one contributor to PD, but the exact mechanisms underlying GAPDH involvement in neurodegenerative disease remains to be clarified. The SNP rs3741916 in the 5' UTR of the GAPDH gene may be associated with late onset Alzheimer's disease.  Interactions  = Protein binding partners = GAPDH participates in a number of biological functions through its protein–protein interactions with: * tubulin to facilitate microtubule bundling; * actin to facilitate actin polymerization; * VDAC1 to induce mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (MMP) and apoptosis; * Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor to regulate intracellular Ca2+ signaling; * Oct-1 to form the coactivator complex OCA-S, which is required for histone H2B synthesis during S phase of the cell cycle; * p22 to aid microtubule organization; * Rab2 to facilitate endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–golgi transport; * Transferrin on the surface of diverse cells and in extracellular fluid; * Lactate dehydrogenase; * Lactoferrin;Secreted multifunctional Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase sequesters lactoferrin and iron into cells via a non-canonical pathway.

B5) is a German federal highway running in a northwesterly to southeasterly direction from the Danish border near Niebüll to Frankfurt (Oder). It provides a direct route for motorists traveling between Berlin and Hamburg. In Berlin B5 forms among others the following squares and streets Heerstraße, Theodor-Heuss-Platz, Kaiserdamm, Straße des 17. Juni, Großer Stern, Unter den Linden, Karl-Liebknecht-Straße, Alexanderplatz, Karl-Marx-Allee, Frankfurter Tor, and Frankfurter Allee. The section north of Hamburg is partially paralleled by Bundesautobahn 23. History The numbering of Bundesstraße 5 follows the numbering of highways, then called in (literally in ), in the Weimar Republic, issued on 17 January 1932. The Fernverkehrsstraße 5, or simply 5, however, continued from Frankfurt upon Oder (today as Polish DK29) via Crossen upon Oder, (today as Polish DK32) via Grünberg in Silesia, (today as Polish S3) via Lüben, (today as Polish DK36) via Parchwitz, (today as Polish DK94) via Breslau, Ohlau, Brieg, Oppeln in Silesia, Peiskretscham, (today as Polish DW901) via Gleiwitz (today as Polish DK88) to Beuthen in Upper Silesia. The route between Berlin and Frankfurt upon Oder was already completed in 1803. The route from there to Breslau was built between 1817 and 1819. In 1824 the route was extended from Breslau until Gleiwitz. The section between Berlin and Hamburg was upgraded to a highway between 1827 and 1830, with its section crossing the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin representing the first structurally designed road there. The routes Northwest of Hamburg were built in the 1850s. The section from Itzehoe until Bredstedt was finished in 1858. In 1934 the Fernverkehrsstraßen were renamed into Reichsstraßen (literally in ), but the numbering remained Reichsstraße 5 or R 5. By the Agreement of Potsdam in August 1945 the section East of the Oder-Neiße Line came under Polish authority and was subsequently renumbered within the Polish system of long-distance routes. After the foundation of the two new German republics in 1949 the section of R 5 within the West German Federal Republic of Germany and in West Berlin became Bundesstraße 5 (literally in ) or B 5. The section in the East German Democratic Republic (GDR) and East Berlin was given back its former name Fernverkehrsstraße 5 or F 5. During the division of Germany the F 5 played a crucial role as transit route () between West Berlin and West German Northern Germany. Transit passengers were not allowed to deviate from the route. In East Berlin F 5 passed the Brandenburg Gate, which became an East Berlin checkpoint within the Berlin Wall on August 13, 1961, but was closed the very next day until December 22, 1989. F 5 gradually lost its function as transit route to new built autobahns (today's A 19 and A 24) until it was rededicated for intra-GDR traffic only on 21 December 1987. After the unification of East Berlin, the GDR and West Berlin with the Federal Republic of Germany on October 3, 1990 the F 5 was named into Bundesstraße 5 or B 5.

OUSA was founded in 1890 to advance student interests on campus. Today, OUSA provides a combination of representation, welfare, advocacy, recreation, fun and events for its members. Notably, it runs student support services, supports clubs and societies on campus, and organises the University of Otago Orientation and Reorientation weeks. OUSA fully owns and partially owns a number of subsidiary companies, including Planet Media Dunedin Limited which funds Critic, the student magazine, and Radio One, the student radio station. History As well as providing facilities and student representation on university committees, the students' association began to provide services and facilities for its members. The first Student Union building, providing meeting rooms, men's and women's common rooms and a cafeteria, was established in 1904 in Allen Hall, which is today the university's theatre department. In the 1960s a much bigger Student Union was built, and in the 1980s an adjoining building was added to house the OUSA offices, Radio One, Critic and Student Job Search. The Clubs and Societies building provides a home to over 100 student clubs and a variety of activities, with fitness and recreation opportunities provided at Unipol, jointly owned with the Otago Polytechnic Students' Association. OUSA also owns the University Book Shop and Student Job Search. Over the years the Students' Association has had its share of controversy, frequently around risqué activities during Capping (graduation) week. In 1990, student parties spilled over into the infamous \\"Dunedin Riot\\", which badly damaged public opinion of students at a time when student politicians were actively lobbying and protesting against the introduction of tertiary tuition fees. The arguments against tuition fees included researched predictions of massive graduate debt and increased \\"brain drain\\" – graduates leaving the country for lucrative overseas positions. OUSA and students' associations around the country protested vigorously – up to 5,000 people marched in Dunedin alone – but were unable to stop the fees which were introduced in 1991. In July 2010, the OUSA executive was controversially restructured. Initiated by President Harriet Geoghegan, the new executive would have ten members: President, Administrative Vice President, Finances and Services Officer, Education Officer, Welfare Officer, and five general representatives each holding a portfolio: Postgraduate Students, International Students, Campaigns, Recreation, and Colleges and Communications. A referendum on the issue resulted in a 72.19% vote for the new structure caused a large number of complaints, none of which were upheld, and divided the existing OUSA Executive. The introduction of tuition fees has led to an increased focus on quality of education, with improvements to the student representative system and more student input on teaching and assessment. At the same time, the growing student population has meant that OUSA services from recreation facilities to student media have become businesses in their own right. Structure =Membership= Under the Education Act 1989, membership in OUSA was compulsory for students enrolled at the University of Otago. However, since 2011 the Government made all students' association in New Zealand voluntary membership. The OUSA now maintains a Service Level Agreement (SLA) with the University, which sees a proportion of the compulsory student services levy used to pay for OUSA services for students, this allows for the ongoing financial viability of the Association. =Executive= The Association is headed by an eleven-member executive led by the OUSA President. The Executive consists of the President, Administrative Vice-President, Finance Officer, Welfare Officer, Education Officer, Campaigns Officer, Recreation Officer, Colleges Officer, International Representative and the Postgraduate Representative. Executive meetings are held weekly or fortnightly, and are open to all members, Student General Meetings (SGMs) are held periodically throughout the year to consult with and engage the wider student body in a more formal context. { class=\\"wikitable collapsible autocollapse\\" !style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Executive Position !style=\\"text- align: left;\\"  2020 Officeholder - !style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  President Jack Manning - !style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Administrative Vice-President Georgia Mischefski-Grayhttps://www.ousa.org.nz/contact/ousa-student-executive - !style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Finance and Strategy Officer Josh Meikle - !style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Academic Representative Emily Coyle - !style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Welfare Representative Michaela Waite-Harvey - !style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Political Representative Francesca Dykes - !style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Clubs and Societies Representative Josh Smith - !style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Colleges Representative Jack Saunders - !style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  International Representative Arina Aizal - !style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Postgraduate Representative Hanna Van der Giessen - !style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Te Roopū Māori Tumuāki Karamea Pewhairangi - !University of Otago Pacific Islands Students' Association President Josh Alefosio-Pei } =Elections= Elections are held annually to select the incoming executive for the following year. Election weeks typically involve candidate forums for questions and debating between individuals running for office. In September 2008, president-elect Jo Moore was disqualified from becoming the 2009 president after a complaint she came within 20 m of a polling facility during voting was upheld. Student Services =Annual Events= The OUSA is responsible for organising the annual Orientation week events held at the beginning of the university year. A number of well-known artists have performed at these events including Macklemore, Tinie Tempah, Empire of the Sun, Flume and Shapeshifter. At the beginning of the second semester, in July, OUSA organises the equivalent Reorientation events. The Hyde Street party, also known as the Hyde Street Keg Party, is an annual event held in Dunedin in the first semester for students from the University of Otago and Otago Polytechnic, where many participants wear fancy dress. The infamous event originated in 1995, starting as a post exam celebration organised by residents. The first event saw roughly 3,000 people and attracted bonfires, riot police and 13 students were arrested. It has since become a become a regular part of the Otago University social calendar. Since 2013 OUSA has organised the ticket sales and the health and safety surrounding the event. Other regular events organised by the OUSA include market days, art week, diversity week, the Capping Show, The Dunedin Craft Beer & Food Festival and an annual Battle of the Bands competition. =Clubs and Societies= The OUSA Clubs and Societies Centre at 84 Albany Street is a hub for students, clubs and societies. As the largest student association at the University of Otago the majority of on campus clubs and societies affiliate to the association. Notably the Otago University Debating Society, now an affiliated club, pre-dates the formation of the Association, and it was members of the debating society that initiated the formation of OUSA in 1890. There are a number of long-standing clubs and societies on campus including the Otago University Rowing Club, the Otago University Rugby Football Club and the Otago University Medical Students Association. Today there are more than 150 clubs and societies affiliated to OUSA, representing a huge range of ethnicities, religions, politics, sports and interests of Otago students. At the centre of the clubs and societies on campus is the OUSA Clubs and Societies Centre. This centre houses the staff that manage the various clubs and societies and the recreation programmes organised by OUSA. Facilities within the centre for students include a sauna, study rooms, music rooms, dance rooms, storage for clubs and an exercise hall. A number of recreation classes are organised and run from the centre, encompassing everything from arts, crafts and cooking, to music, sport and dance. Cheap lunches are available at the centre daily during University semesters, and these are organised and provided by Hare Krishna Dunedin and Community Sai Youth. Notably the Hare Krishna Dunedin group have been providing cheap lunches for over twenty years. =Student Support= OUSA owns and maintains a department that provides support and advocacy for students. This includes class representation, queer support, a hardship fund and advocacy for a number of grievances. Student Media =Critic= Critic is an award-winning University of Otago-based student magazine funded and supported by OUSA through its subsidiary Planet Media Ltd. Critic is the official magazine of the Otago University Students' Association. It is freely available around both the university's campus and selected sites in Dunedin city weekly during term time. Critic is New Zealand's longest-running student newspaper, having been published since 1925. Weekly circulation is 5,000 copies, with an estimated readership of 21,000. Critic is a member of the Aotearoa Student Press Association (ASPA), and was awarded Best Publication in the annual ASPA awards in 2005, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2013. Critic has caused controversy on a number of occasions in the past. In 2006 the Office of Film and Literature Classification banned an issue of the magazine, due to it containing a \\"how- to-guide\\" on drug rape. Possession or distribution of this issue was deemed illegal. In 2010 The Press Council upheld a complaint against Critic over the article 'The Bum at the Bottom of the World', which depicted three people the publication deemed homeless and vagrant. In 2013 Critic's Editor Callum Fredric received a $35,000 payout after a series of personal disputes with OUSA General Manager Darel Hall. Fredric was suspended by Hall on Friday 3 May, and was trespassed from OUSA buildings by Hall after attending a meeting on Monday 6 May to explain the situation to staff, before being asked to leave by Police. After filing legal proceedings, Fredric accepted a $35,000 settlement package from OUSA on Friday 17 May, and resigned as Editor.\\"'Critic' Editor Steps Down\\". Otago Daily Times. Tue, 21 May 2013.

The station is run largely by volunteer announcers, with a small paid staff. It runs a wide variety of general interest and specialist shows to audiences not catered for by other Dunedin radio stations, such as New Zealand music show The Local and cannabis law reform radio show Overgrown. It is run by Planet Media on behalf of Otago University Students' Association. In the station's early years, Radio One was broadcast from a 100-watt ERP transmitter atop the 11-storey Hocken Building (now Richardson Building) - then the tallest building on the university campus. In the late 1980s, the station moved their transmitter to Dunedin's main FM radio transmitter atop Mount Cargill, north of the campus. This gives the station a range which covers much of coastal Otago, from Oamaru to past Balclutha. Radio One can now be heard anywhere in the world as it streams all content in 128 kbit/s stereo mp3 over the Internet. The impetus for the station began with an open letter to the President of the Association (then Phyllis Comerford) from Alastair Thomson, who had worked on the Waikato University student radio station. This letter brought together other interested parties including members of the bands Netherworld Dancing Toys and The Verlaines. With a grant from the OUSA of approximately $12,000, the station first went to air in early 1984 broadcasting from the OUSA's former boardroom. The station ran on a part-time basis during the university year until the mid-1990s, from which time it has been operating round-the-clock throughout the year in a new annex to the Student Union building which was specifically designed to house the station, the OUSA's offices, and the university's student newspaper Critic. The station celebrated its 25th birthday at the beginning of 2009. Radio One alumni include Shayne Carter, Wallace Chapman, Charlotte Glennie, Sam Hayes, Jan Hellriegel, Lesley Paris, David Pine, Brent Hodge, Sean Norling, Chris Armstrong and Ria Vandervis. Aaron Hawkins served as Radio One's breakfast host from 2006 to 2013 and music director from 2011 to 2013 before standing for the Dunedin mayoralty and being elected a Dunedin City central ward councillor.

Broadway in Downtown Los Angeles is one of the first movie palaces built in the United States. It opened in 1917 with the premiere of William S. Hart's The Silent Man. It's the northernmost of the collection of historical movie palaces in the Broadway Theater District and stands directly across from the landmark Bradbury Building. The theater is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. History The Million Dollar was the first movie house built by entrepreneur Sid Grauman in 1918 as the first grand cinema palace in L.A. Grauman was later responsible for Grauman's Egyptian Theatre and Grauman's Chinese Theatre, both on Hollywood Boulevard, and was partly responsible for the entertainment district shifting from downtown Los Angeles to Hollywood in the mid-1920s. Sculptor Joseph Mora did the elaborate and surprising exterior Spanish Colonial Revival ornament, including bursts of lavish Churrigueresque decoration, statues, longhorn skulls, and other odd features. The auditorium architect was William L. Woollett, and the designer of the 12-story tower was Los Angeles architect Albert C. Martin Sr. For many years, the office building housed the headquarters of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. The facade at the top of the building =1940s= In the '40s, the theater was the second-run house of the famous Orpheum Circuit. Acts such as the Nat King Cole Trio, and Joe Liggins and The Honey Drippers performed on its stage. In 1949, the Million Dollar was taken over by Frank Fouce, a local Spanish-language theater owner and film distributor. The Million Dollar Theater became the mecca of Spanish-language entertainment in the United States. Dolores del Río, Cantinflas, María Félix, Agustín Lara, José Alfredo Jiménez, José Feliciano, Juan Gabriel, Vicente Fernández, and Celia Cruz are but a few of the artists that worked for Empresa Fouce. It was also the first venue where the late Mexican film star Antonio Aguilar worked with his rodeo horses on stage. This is where it is said he conceived the idea for his large arena rodeo productions. =1950s-1960s= In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Fouce went on to found Spanish International Communications Corp., named after his Spanish International Theater Company (which included the Million Dollar and the Mayan Theater, also located in Downtown Los Angeles). This company comprised the first group of Spanish-language and UHF television stations in the U.S.; KMEX Channel 34 in Los Angeles (and, indirectly, the Univision television network) can trace its roots to the Million Dollar Theatre. The Million Dollar and the Fouce Family were pioneers in the then-unheard-of Spanish entertainment industry. For their efforts, Fouce was awarded El Aguila Azteca (Order of the Aztec Eagle), Mexico's highest civilian award, by President Miguel Alemán Valdés. The theater and Fouce were also honored by the Mexican actors' union ANDA for their contributions to the Mexican film, recording, and entertainment industries. In addition to its successful stage productions, the theater was also the most prominent Spanish-language cinema in the United States. Every major Mexican motion picture premiered at the Million Dollar. The Million Dollar featured Mariachi Music at its best: Mariachi Vargas, Mariachi Chapala de Leopoldo Sosa y Esteban Hernandez, Mariachi Los Gallos de Crescencio Hernandez, Mariachi Los Galleros de Pedro Rey (Hernandez), Mariachi los Camperos (led by Nati Cano), Mariachi Mexico de Pepe Villa. =1970s-1990s= Gonzalo L. Checa, president of the Spanish division of the Metropolitan Theater Corporation, was responsible for the upsurge of attendance at the Million Dollar in the '70s and '80s due to his great expertise and keen insight of the entertainment needs of the Hispanic community. During this golden heyday, the long lines of people waiting to attend the Million Dollar would wrap around the block and cause the Los Angeles Police Department to close down Broadway to traffic. The theater's marquee in 2006 Checa became a low-profile power broker and behind-the-scenes player, who helped launch the U.S. invasion of stars like Vicente Fernández, José José, Nelson Ned, Juan Gabriel, Julio Alemán, Evita Muñoz (\\"Chachita\\"), María Elena Velasco (\\"La India Maria\\"), Enrique Cuenca Marquez and Eduardo Manzano (\\"Los Polivoces\\"), Raúl Ramírez, Jorge Rivero, Rodolfo de Anda, Eulalio Gonzalez (\\"El Piporo\\"), Joan Sebastian, Antonio Aguilar and his wife Flor Silvestre, Gaspar Henaine (\\"Capulina\\"), and the famous silver masked wrestler Rodolfo Guzmán Huerta (\\"El Santo\\"). Ira Yellin (then the owner of Grand Central Market) acquired the building in 1989. =21st century= After serving as the home of a Spanish-language church for some years, as of 2006, the Million Dollar Theatre was empty, although the office building had been recently renovated and converted to residential space. In February 2008, the theater reopened, once again showing live Spanish theatre. It closed again in 2012. In 2017, the building was sold to Langdon Street Capital, and the theater and retail space were leased to fashion startup CoBird. The theatre is home to special movie screenings that feature historic theatres in the Broadway district of DTLA. The series features classic films in a historical setting.

The name was changed in preparation for the 2009 session. The program operated under the previous name during the summers of 2005 to 2008. Professionals, scholars, and students attended the Laboratory - to train, develop new work, and conduct research - representing theatre companies and conservatories in several countries throughout the six inhabited continents. Held primarily in Smolyan, Bulgaria, in the center of the Rhodopi Mountains (or Rhodope Mountains), and hosted at the Rodopa Drama Theater (RDT) complex, the Lab served as a meeting ground for international collaboration. Background The Rhodopa Mountains is the mythological birthplace of Orpheus and the original terrain of the cult of Dionysus, thus a mythological birthplace of Western theatre and performance. The Lab was co-directed by Bulgarian theatre director Peter Karapetkov and American theatre director Jared J. Stein. It was founded by Karapetkov, Stein, RDT Artistic Director Krustyo Krustev, and American dramaturg Benjamin Nadler, who all collaborated at the RDT previously. In 2004, they led the RDT to partner with the Krastyo Sarafov National Academy for Theatre and Film Arts (NATFA) in Sofia, the Center for Research in Engineering, Media and Performance (REMAP) at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of Zagreb's Academy of Dramatic Art to present the 2005 RITC. UCLA REMAP's Executive Director Jeff Burke led workshops and collaborations every summer, directing teams of artists and researchers to experiment with emerging technologies and different forms of performance - made possible by multiple grants of support from the Trust for Mutual Understanding. NATFA's Alexander Iliev served as a performance anthropologist, movement director and resident artist for all eight of the summers. Leon Katz was one the original initiative's advisers and was a dramaturg and lecturer during the inaugural session in 2005. Other advisers included the Eugene O'Neill Theatre Center’s J Ranelli. Development The program grew considerably as Italian dramaturg Sergio Costola (Southwestern University) and American director Jed Allen Harris (Carnegie Mellon School of Drama) joined as yearly contributors in 2006 and 2007 respectively. The changing of the name from Collective to Laboratory, and including Katz, occurred at the conclusion of the 2008 session, while the International Theatre Institute's Martha Coigney and the Center for International Theatre Development’s Philip Arnoult were both in residence. In 2010 the RDT merged with the company of the Dramatichen Theatre in Plovdiv (Drama Theatre Plovdiv or PDT) at the foot of the Rhodopa Mountains, and the unified company then operated facilities in both locations. In addition to the program's schedule of research trips throughout the region, for the last few years, the RITL held events of each session's performance schedule at the Plovdiv complex. Professional RDT or PDT company members participated in the Lab each summer. The PDT and RDT complex were no longer connected as of the 2012 and final RITL session. Processes Each Lab session consisted of multiple, intertwined professional development, training, and hybrid (professional-student) processes – connected by a set of parallel mythos chosen for each year - and yielded numerous works-in-progress. Master teachers conducted intensive workshops in traditional drama, movement and object-based forms – such as Bharatha Natyam, the Cham Mysteries, Chinese Opera, Commedia dell'Arte, Dervish Dance, Kabuki, Pantomime, Kathakali, Karagoz, Kuruma Ningyo, Ngonpa, Noh, Topeng, Wayang Kulit and the accompanying Gamelan music – and modern approaches, such as those influenced by the Factory of the Eccentric Actor, Michael Chekhov, Vsevolod Meyerhold, Konstantin Stanislavski, Jerzy Grotowski and Tadashi Suzuki. Contemporary artists contributed ongoing work and professional practices. The RITC/RITL developed performances that went on to subsequent productions, runs and tours. In the United States alone, Lab work was further developed and performed at the La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club, the Long Wharf Theatre, the McCarter Theater, and the Mixed Blood Theatre Company, among others. Plays developed at the Lab have been published and made available for production. Contributors Long- term contributors included American poet Holly Karapetkova, American composer Jonathan Snipes, and Bulgarian scholar/director Damyan Popchristov (New York University). Professional resident artists included American puppet artists Tom Lee and Matt Acheson, Vera Stoykova of the State Puppet Theatrein Varna, Bulgaria, Japanese composer/musician Yukio Tsuji, American producer Mara Isaacs, American performer/writer Yehuda Hyman, Swedish playwright Aditi Kapil, and American actor Rick Roemer. Former Lab students include professionals working throughout the world of theatre, including New York- based director May Adrales. Bulgarian director Stayko Murdjev was an RITC student while at NATFA and then became a professional resident artist, originating pieces at the Lab that he would further develop and re-stage for some of Bulgaria's most influential companies, appearing at festivals throughout Europe. Among the many workshop directors were Ozden Akturk from Turkey, Piyal Bhattacharya from India, Dijana Milosevic of the DAH Theatre in Serbia, Nyoman Sedana (Indonesian Institute of Arts and the Indonesian State College of Arts), and Lopsang Tharchin (Tibet) of the Nyanang Phelgyeling Monastery in Nepal. Russian actor Valery Garkalin and director Alexander Morfov (Komissarzhevskaya Drama Theatre in Russia and Ivan Vazov National Theatre in Bulgaria) were among the teaching artists the first year, with Morfov returning to teach in 2007. Dostena Anguelova-Lavergne of the International Delphic Council lectured at multiple sessions. Japanese director/choreographer Izumi Ashizawa taught at the RITL in 2010 and 2012. During the 2006 RITC, teachers included Yasen Peyankov of the Steppenwolf Theatre Company and Sue-Ellen Case. The program also arranged for its professional participants to provide workshops and contribute to collaborations at theaters and universities throughout Europe and the United States, e.g., Southwestern University, UCLA, Whittier College, and Carnegie Mellon University.

C.F. Marbut championed reliance on soil morphology instead of on theories of pedogenesis for soil classification because theories of soil genesis are both ephemeral and dynamic. The observable attributes ordinarily described in the field include the composition, form, soil structure and organization of the soil, color of the base soil and features such as mottling, distribution of roots and pores, evidence of translocated materials such as carbonates, iron, manganese, carbon and clay, and the consistence of the soil. The observations are typically performed on a soil profile. A profile is a vertical cut, two-dimensional, in the soil and bounds one side of a pedon. The pedon is the smallest three-dimensional unit, but not less than 1 meter square on top, that captures the lateral range of variability. Micromorphology While soil micromorphology begins in the field with the routine and careful use of a 10x hand lens, much more can be described by careful description of thin sections made of the soil with the aid of a petrographic polarizing light microscope. The soil can be impregnated with an epoxy resin, but more commonly with a polyester resin (crystic 17449) and sliced and ground to 0.03 millimeter thickness and examined by passing light through the thin soil plasma. =Porosity= Porosity of topsoil is a measure of the pore space in soil which typically decreases as grain size increases. This is due to soil aggregate formation in finer textured surface soils when subject to soil biological processes. Aggregation involves particulate adhesion and higher resistance to compaction. Typical bulk density of sandy soil is between 1.5 and 1.7 g/cm3. This calculates to a porosity between 0.43 and 0.36. Typical bulk density of clay soil is between 1.1 and 1.3 g/cm3. This calculates to a porosity between 0.58 and 0.51. This seems counterintuitive because clay soils are termed heavy, implying lower porosity. Heavy apparently refers to a gravitational moisture content effect in combination with terminology that harkens back to the relative force required to pull a tillage implement through the clayey soil at field moisture content as compared to sand. Porosity of subsurface soil is lower than in surface soil due to compaction by gravity. Porosity of 0.20 is considered normal for unsorted gravel size material at depths below the biomantle. Porosity in finer material below the aggregating influence of pedogenesis can be expected to approximate this value. Soil porosity is complex. Traditional models regard porosity as continuous. This fails to account for anomalous features and produces only approximate results. Furthermore it cannot help model the influence of environmental factors which affect pore geometry. A number of more complex models have been proposed, including fractals, bubble theory, cracking theory, Boolean grain process, packed sphere, and numerous other models. Soil composition by laboratory methods =Soil texture= An experienced soil scientist can determine soil texture in the field with decent accuracy, but not all soils lend themselves to accurate field determinations of soil texture. The mineral texture can be obfuscated by high soil organic matter, iron oxides, amorphous or short-range-order aluminosilicates, and carbonates. Soil texture is the relative relations of the components sand, silt, and clay. Texture is most often reported as percentages on a mass basis. Laboratory methods employ chemical pretreatments to mediate the effects of organic matter, iron oxides, amorphous or short-range-order aluminosilicates, and carbonates.  Soil micromorphology in Archaeology  Soil micromorphology has been a recognized technique in soil science for some 50 years and experience from pedogenic and palaeosol studies first permitted its use in the investigation of archaeologically buried soils. More recently, the science has expanded to encompass the characterisation of all archeological soils and sediments and has been successful in providing unique cultural and palaeoenvironmental information from a whole range of archaeological sites.

It was a dryosaurid iguanodontian, and its fossils have been found in late Kimmeridgian-age rocks (Late Jurassic) of the Tendaguru Formation, Tanzania. The type and only species of the genus is D. lettowvorbecki. This species was named by Josef Felix Pompeckj in 1920 in honor of the Imperial German Army Officer, Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck. For much of the 20th century the species was referred to the related and approximately contemporary genus Dryosaurus, but newer studies reject this synonymy.  Discovery  Thousands of Dysalotosaurus bones and bone fragments have been recovered from the Tendaguru Formation in Tanzania, Africa. It has been suggested that all of these specimens were part of a herd that was killed in a mass death event.  Description  Dysalotosaurus was a small, relatively basal iguanodontian ornithopod. It lacked the large thumb spikes found in later iguanodontians, and was more adapted for bipedalism than its larger relatives with its short front limbs and long, counter-balancing tail. Dysalotosaurus had powerful and long hind limbs, suggesting it was relatively cursorial compared to Iguanodon and other members of the clade. Based on CT scans of the braincase, it is believed that Dysalotosaurus held its head dorsally (pointing straight forward) when not feeding. The same study also suggested, based on the morphology of the inner ear, that Dysalotosaurus was not able to discern between high- and low-frequency sounds (like most herbivorous dinosaurs). However, it also had other adaptations that are commonly associated with derived hearing abilities, rendering its sensory capabilities unclear. In 2016, Gregory S. Paul estimated Dysalotosaurus' length at , and its weight at . = Ontogeny = Various specimens of Dysalotosaurus are known, all representing animals that were not yet sexually mature at the time of their deaths. Ontogenetic studies demonstrate typical aging trends, such as a lengthening of the snout and relative shrinking of the orbit. Differences in dentition as the animals aged also suggest a change from an omnivorous diet early in life to fully herbivorous feeding habits as an adult. This switch reflects the general evolutionary trend towards obligate herbivory among iguanodontians and other ornithopods. Palaeobiology Side view of skeleton Dysalotosaurus was a precocial dinosaur, which experienced sexual maturity at ten years, had an indeterminate growth pattern, and maximum growth rates comparable to a large kangaroo. =Palaeopathology= In 2011 paleontologists Florian Witzmann and Oliver Hampe from the Museum für Naturkunde and colleagues discovered that deformations of some Dysalotosaurus bones were likely caused by a viral infection similar to Paget's disease of bone. This is the oldest evidence of viral infection known to science. The discovery of a hemivertebra (spinal malformation) in another specimen likely caused scoliosis and other pathologic effects on the animal during its life. This malformation occurs in almost every vertebrate clade, though this is the first known evidence of the condition in dinosaurs.  Palaeoecology  Contemporary dinosaurs were Kentrosaurus, various sauropods including Giraffatitan and Dicraeosaurus, and large theropods including Megalosaurus and Ceratosaurus. Pterosaurs are also common in the Tendaguru Formation, as well as mammaliaformes (ancestral to mammals). During the Jurassic, Tendaguru was part of the semi-arid coastline of Gondwana. Dysalotosaurus fossils were discovered in strata that were deposited in structures characteristic of tidal flats and lagoons.

Controversies Roger was invited as a guest speaker at the Glasgow University RFC 150th anniversary event held in Glasgow on 16 November 2019 where he made sexist remarks about some of the female rugby team players and racist remarks regarding a previous encounter with a person of Japanese origin. Roger was heckled off the stage and the GURFC has since issued an apology for inviting him to speak, reiterating that they are a club who promotes inclusivity and diversity and that the remarks do not reflect those of the University or the Rugby Society. Playing career Baird attended St. Mary's School, Melrose and Merchiston Castle School in Edinburgh. Both schools are noted for producing strong rugby players, and he went on to play scrum- half for the Scottish Schools team. He played for the full Kelso sevens team while still at Merchiston, collecting a Melrose winner’s medal at 17. Bill McLaren considered him an exceptional sevens player. Within two years he was capped by Scotland B, and he won the first of 27 caps in the 24-15 win over at Murrayfield Stadium in 1981, replacing Bruce Hay. A regular fixture on the left wing for Scotland, he went on the 1983 British Lions tour to New Zealand, playing in all four Tests, and scoring six tries in 11 appearances. In one of these tries in particularly wet weather, he slammed right into the billboards around the pitch. Baird also played for the South of Scotland rugby union team.

The station is south of Manchester Piccadilly on the Mid-Cheshire Line to Chester. The line is referred to as the Chester via Altrincham line at Manchester Piccadilly, but as the Manchester via Stockport line at Chester station. History A goods train passing through Knutsford, with the old (now removed) signal box at the north end of platform 2 Knutsford station opened to passengers on 12 May 1862 with a service between Knutsford and Altrincham. Trains to Northwich commenced from 1 January 1863. Services were operated by CLC until nationalisation on 1 January 1948. The station - as built by Cheshire Lines Railway - more correctly \\"Cheshire Lines Committee\\" (CLC) - was built on the site of the farm mentioned in Elizabeth Gaskell's novel Cranford where the cow fell into a lime-pit. The Goods Yard was originally on the south-east side of the track, above the huge brick retaining wall, which ever after became a home for large posters. Later it was re-sited to the north and the original site became the Station Master's garden. There used to be a competition for the best station garden: Knutsford often won this. Facilities The station has a ticket office and two car parks but no taxi rank. Both platforms are step-free. Buses call at Adams Hill, adjacent to the car park next to the Chester bound platform. However, half of this car park is private office parking, and is not available to rail users. Station facilities were improved in March 2009 with the addition of a cold drinks and snacks vending machine in the station ticket office. On the Chester bound platform is a Bike & Go bike hire facility, similar in nature to London's Santander Cycles.

Knutsford railway station in 2015, as seen from platform 1 In December 2008 services were revised with the additional morning Chester to Manchester peak services terminating at Stockport, and the additional Manchester to Chester evening peak services starting instead at Stockport, which has prompted an online petition. The revision was necessary to allow the operation of additional services between Manchester and London Euston over the already congested Stockport railway viaduct. The 15:49 Chester to Manchester service was lost altogether, as was the Saturday 07:30 Chester to Manchester service. However, the Sunday service was significantly improved, increasing to a 2-hourly service that runs from Chester to Southport via Manchester Piccadilly, rather than a 3-hourly service between Chester and Altrincham. The average journey time to and from Manchester in the current timetable is between 38 and 49 minutes. This is due to Northern Rail timetabling trains to take longer than expected, to meet punctuality targets. Times to and from Chester take between 41 and 46 minutes, for the same reason. Passengers numbers at Knutsford are currently increasing by as much as 27% per annum. Knutsford is also the most used station between Mouldsworth and Navigation Road (not including Metrolink figures at Altrincham and Navigation Road.) Also, more passengers board and alight Mid Cheshire line services at Knutsford station than at Stockport station or Chester station. Knutsford has poorer bus services than other nearby towns which, contributes to more rail use. Future A campaign was set up by the Knutsford Guardian in 2007 for a later train from Manchester Piccadilly to Knutsford on Friday and Saturday evenings than the current last train which leaves Manchester Piccadilly at 23:17. Retrieval Date: 18 July 2007. The 00.32 Saturday Morning Only Manchester Piccadilly to Chester train currently runs non-stop through Knutsford (and all other stations on the Mid Cheshire line), thus a stop at Knutsford (and Northwich) could be facilitated relatively easily. Re-opening the line between Northwich and Sandbach has been proposed. This will allow direct trains to Crewe from Knutsford, giving a better connection to the Midlands and the South of England. Retrieval Date: 18 July 2007. Proposals for a direct link to Manchester Airport from Knutsford were first put forward in the 1990s, not much had seemed to materialise from this. However, in 2009 Network Rail stated that the creation of the third platform has meant that the capacity at Manchester airport will become constrained by the layover of the trains and congestion at the throat. To solve this issue they have recommended building a line underneath the Airport towards Northwich in the 2019 to 2024 period. The running of tram-trains directly into Manchester (via Sale) has been looked into. In 2013 TfGM said that running tram-trains to Knutsford would provide poor value for money and that alternative heavy rail options should be looked at instead.

The university had 1743 students during the 2019-20 academic year, over 1650 being full-time equivalents. Founded in 1939, it has a total undergraduate enrollment of 1,204 on a campus size of 126 acres.https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/william- jessup-university-1281 History The University was founded as San Jose Bible College in 1939, in San Jose by William Jessup, the school's first President. Eugene Claremont Sanderson had originally started a school called Evangel Bible University in San Jose in 1934 but was unable to make it viable. As a result, he recruited William Jessup, one of his former students to take over. By 1951, with the school expanding and the San José State University across the street encroaching, San Jose Bible College moved to a parcel bordered by Coyote Creek, 12th Street and nearly 30 years later by I-280. Spanish-style classroom buildings and several dormitory buildings made up the small campus. William Jessup retired in 1960 and was succeeded by Alvan L. Tiffin. Later, Woodrow Phillips, an alumnus, was president from 1968 to 1979. Dr. Bryce Jessup, a Pepperdine University alumnus and son of the original president, was President from 1984–2010, when he retired. Dr. John Jackson was selected to be the sixth President in March 2011. In 1989, the school was renamed San Jose Christian College and was regionally accredited by WASC in 2002. As administration was unable to find a new location in the Santa Clara Valley, it was decided to move to the Sacramento metropolitan city of Rocklin in April 2003. The College officially moved from its San Jose campus in June 2004. At this time the college was renamed William Jessup University. A branch campus has been retained in San Jose that primarily serves non-traditional and graduate students. The current location was formerly a Herman Miller Furniture Factory, and many of the buildings were designed by Frank Gehry. Organization =Academics= Jessup offers 25 undergraduate majors, 10 graduate programs, 5 degree completion programs and 9 fully online programs.

Developmental history  Following World War II, the atomic bombings, at Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the deconstruction of their imperial military, Japan came under the US \\"nuclear umbrella\\" on the condition that they would not produce nuclear weapons. The requirement was imposed by the United States that Japan might develop nuclear weapons, as the technology to develop a nuclear device became known around the world. This was formalized in the Security Treaty Between the United States and Japan, a corollary to the Treaty of Peace with Japan, which authorized the U.S. to deploy military forces in Japan in order \\"to contribute to the maintenance of the international peace and security in the Far East and to the security of Japan against armed attack from without\\". The treaty was first invoked in 1953 when, following a series of Japanese airspace violations by Soviet MiG-15s, the Japanese Foreign Ministry requested U.S. intervention.Emmerson, John K. and Humphreys, Leonard A. Will Japan Rearm?: A Study in Attitudes, Amerhi Institute for Public Policy Research, January 1973. = Early public opposition = In the years after the occupation, with the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki still fresh in the Japanese consciousness, public sentiment was strongly against the use, and even presence on Japanese soil, of nuclear weapons. This sentiment was evidenced by the widely reported accidental irradiation of the Daigo Fukuryu Maru from a U.S. hydrogen bomb test in 1954. News of the incident aroused public fears over radiation and outcry against atomic and nuclear weapons testing. An \\"Honest John\\" rocket On 28 July 1955, the U.S. announced its intention to equip military bases in Japan with Honest Johns, conventional missiles which could also be fitted with atomic warheads. The Eisenhower Administration and Hatoyama Cabinet had been arranging for the deployment since March, but the announcement sparked outrage in the Diet and public protest. Okazaki and Hatoyama were forced to make assurances to the Diet that the missiles would not be equipped with nuclear warheads on Japanese territory, and that the United States would have to consult with the entire government before introducing nuclear weapons into Japan. The language of the Atomic Energy Basic Law, adopted in December 1955, reflects the public sentiment, restricting \\"the research, development and utilization of atomic energy\\" to \\"peaceful purposes\\". Nuclear power is used in Japan. In 1957, Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi stated his opinion that nuclear weapons were not technically prohibited by Article 9 of the Peace Constitution, though for reasons of humanity and in accordance with popular sentiment national policy should prohibit both their use and introduction. (Even this interpretation of the Constitution, however, drew criticism.) Prime Minister Ikeda Hayato reaffirmed the policy in 1962.Weinstein, Martin E. Japan's Postwar Defense Policy, 1947-1968, Columbia University Press, 1971. Japanese religious leaders were strongly opposed to nuclear weapons— Josei Toda, second President of the Soka Gakkai, issued a declaration, on 8 September 1957, for the complete abolition of nuclear weapons. = Satō's \\"Four Pillars\\" Policy = Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) President Eisaku Satō was elected Prime Minister in December 1964 (only a month after China revealed its nuclear weapons capability with a test explosion). Although privately supportive of Japanese nuclearization, circumstances led Prime Minister Satō to first articulate the now-standard Three Non-Nuclear Principles, and he is remembered for his contributions to non-proliferation. Most significantly, he was determined to reacquire the island of Okinawa from U.S. occupation. Frustrated by strong public sentiment against the U.S. nuclear presence there, Satō struck a deal with the Johnson Administration, exchanging control of Okinawa for Japan's entry into the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). To ease public misgivings about his administration's nuclear ambitions, Satō introduced the Three Non-Nuclear Principles to the Diet in 1967. Retroactively, to lessen the principles' restriction on Japanese military defense options, in 1968 Satō broadened the principles into the \\"Four Pillars Nuclear Policy\\" of (1) promoting the use of nuclear power for peaceful purposes, (2) global nuclear disarmament, (3) reliance on the U.S. nuclear deterrent for protection from nuclear attack, and (4) the Three Principles. In particular, the fourth pillar called for adherence to the principles \\"under the circumstances where Japan's national security is guaranteed by the other three policies\\", implying that a change of circumstances might allow Japan to develop a nuclear program. Amid anxiety over U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, aggression between North and South Korea, and tense Cross-Strait relations, this stipulation served to reassure the Diet that the nuclear option would still be considered if any of the conflicts escalated to threaten Japanese national security. This policy of nuclear abstention was justified internally by the 1968/1970 Report, the product of a secret study commissioned by the Satō Government (leaked to the public in 1994). The document was a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of the nuclear option from technical, economic, political, and international perspectives. Ultimately favoring non-nuclearization, the document concluded that the U.S. nuclear deterrent sufficed to deter outside aggression. It also stressed both Japan's extreme vulnerability to nuclear attack (high population density) and the likelihood of international isolation in the wake of a nuclear weapons program.Campbell, Kurt M. and Sunohara, Tsuyoshi (2004). \\"Japan: Thinking the Unthinkable\\". The Nuclear Tipping Point: Why States Reconsider Their Nuclear Choices Ch. 9: 218–253. Though Satō thought little of the principles and was pliant in his enforcement of the principle of nonintroduction,\\"Peace Prize winner Sato called nonnuclear policy 'nonsense'\\". The Japan Times, 11 June 2000. in view of popular opinion and the embracing of the policy by the rival Social Democratic Party, he and the LDP also remained vocally supportive. In 1970, as desired by the U.S. but after much hesitation and with some key stipulations, Japan signed the NPT; and in 1972, relieved of U.S. nuclear weapons, Okinawa reverted to Japanese rule. The Diet passed a resolution formally adopting the principles in 1971, though they were not made law. Eisaku Satō was presented with the Nobel Peace Prize in 1974, in large part for his work toward Japan's entry into the NPT. In his Nobel Lecture (on the seventh anniversary of his original statement to the Diet), Satō reiterated and discussed the Three Non-Nuclear Principles and expressed hope and confidence that future governments would adopt them as well.Eisaku Satō's Nobel Lecture, 11 December 1974.  Further influence  Opinion polls have consistently revealed that public opinion is overwhelmingly opposed to nuclearization,Kamiya, Matake (2002). \\"Nuclear Japan: Oxymoron or Coming Soon?\\". The Washington Quarterly 26 1: 63–75. as several events over the decades following World War II, even after the end of the Cold War, have demonstrated. Nuclear-free Kobe Port, seen from Po-ai Shiosai Park in 2011 = The Kobe Formula = The port of Kobe was used heavily by the U.S. fleet during its postwar occupation, which ended in 1974. Throughout the occupation, U.S. military facilities at Kobe Port were the target of continuous public protest. Public petitions after Kobe's return to Japan culminated in an 18 March 1975 resolution by the city council to prohibit nuclear-armed vessels from entering the port.\\"Resolution on the Rejection of the Visit of Nuclear- Armed Warships into Kobe Port\\". Kobe City Council, 18 March 1975. U.S. policy being to neither confirm nor deny nuclear weapons deployment, this resolution effectively removed the U.S. naval presence from Kobe Port. Amid the presence of nuclear-powered U.S. vessels and concerns that the government allowed nuclear-armed warships into Japanese ports (later confirmed), this resolution became the first major application of the three non-nuclear principles. The strict policy has become known as the \\"Kobe Formula\\", and since its inception several thousand Japanese municipalities have adopted similar nuclear-free resolutions.Kajimoto, Shushi (2001). \\"Role of Non-Nuclear Kobe Formula in Establishing Nuclear Weapons Free Zones\\" . 2001 World Conference against A & H Bombs, 3–5 August 2001. = Review = In recent years Japanese policymakers have been increasingly public in calling the three non-nuclear principles into question. In October 1999, Deputy Vice Minister of Defense Shingo Nishimura proposed to the Diet (as stated in a previous interview) that, in light of the North Korean threat, serious debate on Japan's nuclearization should begin. Public furor immediately forced Nishimura to resign from the (Keizo) Obuchi Cabinet.French, Howard W. (1999). \\"Furor in Japan as Military Official Advocates Nuclear Weapons\\". The New York Times, 21 October 1999. In May 2002 Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Shinzo Abe repeated the observation of Kishi that Article 9 did not preclude Japan from owning sufficiently small (strictly defensive) nuclear weapons, including ICBMs and atomic bombs. In June of that year, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuo Fukuda, in an off-the-record talk with reporters (for which he later took responsibility), remarked further that \\"circumstances and public opinion could require Japan to possess nuclear weapons\\". Despite being highly hypothetical, both comments provoked public outcry and a sit-in protest in Hiroshima followed Fukuda's remark. Shortly thereafter Fukuda amended his statement, specifying that Japan could not own ICBMs under Article 9.\\"Non-nuclear principles to be reviewed\\". Chūgoku Shimbun Peace News, 2 June 2002. Fukuda was not forced to resign; Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi described his remarks as \\"simply an observation that any basic policy of a country can be reviewed\\" and insists that his government has no intention of reviewing the principles.Berkofsky, Axel (2002). \\"Koizumi under a nuclear smokescreen\\". Asia Times, 13 June 2002. Koizumi continues to reaffirm the principles in each of his addresses for the Hiroshima and Nagasaki Peace Memorial Ceremonies.Address by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi at the Hiroshima Memorial Service, 6 August 2005. More fervent criticism of Japan's non-nuclear policy has come from a few well-known academics and writers, including Kyoto University professor Terumasa Nakanishi and literary critic Kazuya Fukuda (who penned the article \\"A nuclear declaration for Japan\\" for Voice magazine). The majority of writers and scholars, however, tend to support non-nuclearism. Japan decided not to sign the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, a binding agreement for negotiations for the total elimination of nuclear weapons.

The tenets state that Japan shall neither possess nor manufacture nuclear weapons, nor shall it permit their introduction into Japanese territory. The principles were outlined by Prime Minister Eisaku Satō in a speech to the House of Representatives in 1967 amid negotiations over the return of Okinawa from the United States. The Diet formally adopted the principles in 1971.  Overview  After the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japanese public sentiment grew firmly opposed to the presence of nuclear weapons on Japanese soil, or even in Japanese waters.\\"Resolution on the Rejection of the Visit of Nuclear-Armed Warships into Kobe Port\\". Kobe City Council, 18 March 1975. During Eisaku Satō's first term as Prime Minister, this opposition became a major obstacle to his campaign pledge to end the U.S. occupation of Okinawa, returning the island to Japanese control. The U.S. military was thought to keep nuclear weapons on the island, though it did not confirm or deny such weapons, and Satō faced opposition to reacquisition unless the nuclear presence was removed. As a compromise, Satō appeased the United States by bringing Japan into the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in exchange for a nuclear-free, Japan-controlled Okinawa. In the years leading up to this agreement, Satō was forced to appease public concerns that his administration might favor a nuclear weapons program; to this end, he introduced the Three Non-Nuclear Principles in a December 11, 1967, address to the Diet. (Actually, the principles of nonproduction, nonpossession, and nonintroduction had been stated by Defense Agency Director- general Kaneshichi Masuda that May.) Satō worried, though, that the principles might produce too great a restraint on Japan's defense. To lessen their restrictive effect on the military, in a speech the following February he placed the principles within the broader framework of his Four-Pillars Nuclear Policy. The pillars, in mimicry of the three pillars of the NPT, were # To promote the peaceful use of nuclear power, # To work toward global nuclear disarmament, # To rely on the extended U.S. nuclear deterrent # To support the Three Non-Nuclear Principles. The fourth pillar left room for policy change in the future, calling for Japan to abide by the principles \\"under the circumstances where Japan's national security is guaranteed by the other three policies\\". The Diet passed a resolution formally adopting the principles in 1971, though they were not made law. Eisaku Satō was presented with the Nobel Peace Prize in 1974, in large part for his work toward Japan's entry into the NPT. In his Nobel Lecture (on the seventh anniversary of his original statement to the Diet), Satō reiterated and discussed the Three Non-Nuclear Principles and expressed hope and confidence that future governments would adopt them as well. Every Prime Minister of Japan since Satō has publicly reaffirmed the Three Non-Nuclear Principles. However, Japanese government- sponsored studies have been carried out in the past—and are suspected by many to be ongoing—to assess the feasibility of developing a nuclear weapons program. In recent years public officials and nuclearization advocates have been unprecedentedly vocal in questioning the principles, but the public remains committed to them.

Dinosaurs of the Isle of Wight. The Palaeontological Association:London 185-241. He later referred NMHUK R.2522 to Ornithopsis, synonymizing Eucamerotus with Seeley's name based on the discovery of additional vertebrae from the Isle of Wight. Later authors treated Eucamerotus as a synonym of Pelorosaurus.von Huene, F. (1909). Skizze zu einer Systematik und Stammesgeschichte der Dinosaurier.

Blows resurrected the genus in 1995 as a valid brachiosaurid, added the specific name and added the species epithet foxi, designating the various vertebrae that Hulke (1879, 1880) had referred to Ornithopsis as paratypes, while referring additional vertebrae and partial skeleton MIWG-BP001 to it. This last point has not been generally accepted;Upchurch, P.M., Barrett, P.M., and Dodson, P. (2004). Sauropoda. In: Weishampel, D.B., Dodson, P., and Osmólska, H. (eds.). The Dinosauria (2nd edition). University of California Press:Berkeley 259-322. unfortunately, this skeleton has never been officially described. Naish and Martill (2001) suggested Eucamerotus was a dubious brachiosaurid, and did not find Blows' characters convincing. Upchurch et al. (2004) considered it to be a dubious sauropod. However, a more recent review of Wealden sauropods from England places Eucamerotus as a valid genus of Titanosauriformes incertae sedis.Upchurch, P., Mannion, P. D. & Barrett, P. M. 2011. Sauropod dinosaurs. In Batten, D. J. (ed.) English Wealden Fossils. The Palaeontological Association (London), pp. 476-525. Paleobiology The vertebrae are around twenty centimetres long. If a brachiosaurid, Eucamerotus may have been around 15 m (49.2 ft) long, small for a sauropod. As any kind of sauropod, it would have been a quadrupedal herbivore.

History TranStar Airlines Douglas DC-9-51 operating a Houston service at New Orleans in March 1987 with an American Trans Air wide-body L-1011 in the background. Both airlines are notable for never having a fatal accident along with their somewhat \\"ill- fated,\\" co-operative experiences with Southwest Airlines. The company was first established as a Texas-based intrastate airline named Muse Air for its founder, but much like Southwest Airlines, it only operated larger mainline jet aircraft and began to initiate new service to destinations outside of the state of Texas. Muse Air's name originates from its founder and the one time president of Southwest Airlines, Marion Lamar Muse. The airline's first flights consisted of nonstop service between Dallas Love Field (DAL) and Houston Hobby Airport (HOU) in 1981 with two McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft. An air traffic controller's strike almost immediately made things difficult for the company, and Muse stepped down as CEO to let his son Michael take over the company. By the end of 1984 the company was still struggling, and actively looking for a merger to keep it afloat. At the end of the year, Harold Simmons, president of the Amalgamated Sugar Company offered the airline the money to continue, on the condition that Michael Muse resign, and that his father return as CEO. Despite the new influx of cash and Lamar Muse in charge again, the company was not able to generate a consistent profit despite its use of non-union labor and competitive fares. Besides MD-80 jetliners, the airline added McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 and DC-9-50 aircraft to its fleet. During its existence, Muse Air attempted to operate new nonstop routes with jet aircraft that were not being flown by other airlines at the time, including Austin (AUS) - Los Angeles (LAX), Lubbock (LBB) - Los Angeles (LAX), Midland/Odessa (MAF) - Los Angeles (LAX), Houston Hobby (HOU) - Ontario (ONT) and Midland/Odessa (MAF) - Las Vegas (LAS). Muse Air alliance with AirCal In 1984, Muse Air entered into an alliance with California-based AirCal (formerly known as Air California) with connections being listed in its April 29, 1984 system timetable via Los Angeles (LAX) to and from AirCal flights serving Oakland, California (OAK), Portland, Oregon (PDX), Reno, Nevada (RNO), Sacramento (SMF), San Francisco (SFO), and San Jose, California (SJC) and Seattle, Washington (SEA). The January 1, 1984 AirCal system timetable listed connections via Los Angeles (LAX) and Ontario (ONT) to and from Muse Air flights serving Austin (AUS), Houston Hobby (HOU), Midland/Odessa (MAF) and New Orleans (MSY). No smoking policy Muse Air prohibited smoking on their flights long before the U.S. government implemented federal restrictions concerning smoking on board scheduled commercial airline flights. For four years, Muse Air had prohibited smoking on its flights. However, in 1985 the smoking ban was rescinded.Kramon, Glenn. \\"Northwest Airlines Bans Smoking on Most Flights.\\" The New York Times. March 24, 1988. 1. Retrieved on February 8, 2012.

In February 1986 its name was changed to \\"TranStar Airlines.\\"\\"World Airline Directory.\\" Flight International. March 29, 1986. 108. Lamar Muse was removed from having any active role in management, and the company was restructured. McDonnell Douglas MD-80 and DC-9-50 jetliners continued to be operated and the airline's routes were modified to provide flights between California/Nevada and Florida via Texas and Louisiana, primarily via Houston Hobby Airport and New Orleans. These flights were restricted from carrying mail, air freight, and any interline passengers traveling partly on other airlines. TranStar also introduced new nonstop flights such as Houston Hobby (HOU) - San Francisco (SFO), Las Vegas (LAS) - San Francisco (SFO), Los Angeles (LAX) - San Francisco (SFO), Houston Hobby (HOU) - Miami (MIA), New Orleans (MSY) - Los Angeles (LAX), New Orleans (MSY) - Las Vegas (LAS), New Orleans (MSY) - Miami (MIA) and New Orleans (MSY) - San Antonio (SAT). Among other changes were a new corporate image, replacing Muse Air's beige aircraft livery and color scheme branding, with a dark blue tone, accentuated by concentric multi-hued pinstripes banding the fuselage. Attempts were made to integrate the TranStar pilots with Southwest Airlines pilots, but in a classic example of misapplied BATNA an integrated seniority list was rejected by the TranStar pilot's association. At its peak, TranStar employed some 900 people and served 14 cities, but by mid-1987 the company was still not making a profit and the airline was shut down. TranStar's feeder airline In 1986 prior to TranStar being shut down, a commuter airline feeder service in Texas from Austin (AUS) to Killeen (ILE), Laredo (LRD) and San Angelo (SJT), and also from Houston (HOU) to Brownsville (BRO), College Station (CLL), Killeen (ILE) and Victoria (VCT) was established and briefly undertaken under the name and guise \\"TranStar Skylink\\". These services were operated by and in association with Rio Airways. However, none of the commuter turboprop aircraft operated by Rio Airways on the \\"Skylink\\" service were ever painted with TranStar's branding as was indicated in some print advertising. Muse Air destinations in 1985 According to its July 20, 1985 route map, the following destinations were being served by Muse Air shortly after its acquisition by Southwest Airlines: * Austin, Texas (AUS) * Brownsville, Texas (BRO) * Dallas, Texas - Love Field (DAL) * Houston, Texas - Hobby Airport (HOU) - Hub * Las Vegas, Nevada (LAS) * Los Angeles, California (LAX) * McAllen, Texas (MFE) * Midland/Odessa, Texas (MAF) * New Orleans, Louisiana (MSY) - Focus city * Orlando, Florida (MCO) * San Antonio, Texas (SAT) * San Jose, California (SJC) * Tampa, Florida (TPA) * Tulsa, Oklahoma (TUL) Muse Air also previously served Lubbock, Texas (LBB) in 1983, Ontario, California (ONT) in 1984 and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (OKC) in 1985.http://www.departedflights.com/MCoklahomacity85.html TranStar destinations in 1987 According to its June 15, 1987 route map, the following destinations were being served by TranStar shortly before the airline was shut down: * Austin, Texas (AUS) * Brownsville, Texas (BRO) * Dallas, Texas - Love Field (DAL) * Houston, Texas - Hobby Airport (HOU) - Hub * Las Vegas, Nevada (LAS) * Los Angeles, California (LAX) * Miami, Florida (MIA) * New Orleans, Louisiana (MSY)- Focus city * Orlando, Florida (MCO) * San Antonio, Texas (SAT) * San Diego, California (SAN) * San Francisco, California (SFO) * Tampa, Florida (TPA) TranStar also previously served McAllen, Texas (MFE) and Midland/Odessa, Texas (MAF) during 1986.

Recent study by Yates (2006), however, indicates that it is valid and the same animal as putative \\"giant herrerasaurid\\" Aliwalia. Eucnemesaurus was named in 1920 by Egbert Cornelis Nicolaas van Hoepen. The type species is Eucnemesaurus fortis. The specific name means \\"strong\\" in Latin. It is based on holotype TrM 119, a partial skeleton including vertebrae, part of a pubis, a femur, and two tibiae. The remains were found by Van Hoepen in the late Carnian-early Norian-age Upper Triassic Lower Elliot Formation of the Slabberts district, Orange Free State, South Africa. Yates assigned the genus to the new family Riojasauridae, with Riojasaurus, usually regarded as a melanorosaurid. Aliwalia Fossil material now assigned to Eucnemesaurus was once placed in a separate genus and species, Aliwalia rex (the generic name was taken from the Aliwal Park Reserve in the Union of South Africa, where the first remains were found). The fossil evidence of this species was comparably small, with for many years only femoral fragments and a maxilla known, having been sent from South Africa to Austria in 1873 in a shipment with prosauropod bones. The size of the femur led many palaeontologists to believe (along with the clearly carnivorous maxilla), that Aliwalia was a carnivorous dinosaur of remarkable size for the age in which lived. It would have been comparable to that of the large Jurassic and Cretaceous theropods, such as Allosaurus, that evolved tens of millions of years after Aliwalia. The original material was believed to bear a strong similarity to the South American Herrerasaurus, so much so that Aliwalia was originally classified in Herrerasauridae by Peter Galton. However, later re- evaluation of the material has shown that the maxilla assigned to Aliwalia does not, unlike the other material, belong to Eucnemesaurus, as it is clearly from a carnivore. In addition, new material clearly demonstrates this latter genus' sauropodomorph affinities. Sources *E. C.

The plot involves the Big Bad Wolf and Cinderella. Frank Graham voiced the wolf, and Colleen Collins voiced Cinderella, with Imogene Lynn providing her singing voice.\\"Swing Shift Cinderella\\". www.bcdb.com, April 13, 2012 Plot At the beginning of the cartoon, the Big Bad Wolf is chasing Little Red Riding Hood. But then Little Red Riding Hood stops and points out that the two of them are in the wrong cartoon. The Wolf shoos her away and decides to go and meet Cinderella (played by Red from Red Hot Riding Hood). He takes a taxi to her house and immediately falls in love with her upon seeing her, but she sternly rebuffs him. Eventually, Cinderella calls her Fairy Godmother to get rid of him and set her up for that night's ball. The second the Fairy Godmother hears that there is a Wolf, she rushes right over. The Fairy Godmother traps the Wolf, then gives Cinderella a red evening gown and transforms a pumpkin into a Woodie for her to go the ball, but tells Cinderella that she has to get home by midnight (just like in the classic fairy tale). The oversexed Fairy Godmother then keeps the Wolf busy. She appears before him in an old-fashioned 1890s swimsuit (\\"Miss Repulsive 1898\\") and then an evening gown before trying to snuggle up to him on the couch. She chases him all around Cinderella's house, but the Wolf escapes when he gets the Fairy Godmother's wand, turning Cinderella's bathtub into a convertible. He leaves for the nightclub where Cinderella is performing, with the Fairy Godmother in pursuit. Soon after arriving, the Wolf accidentally kisses the Fairy Godmother, thinking she was Cinderella, which only further deepens her lust for the Wolf. Cinderella soon comes out on-stage and performs a show dance while singing the song \\"Oh Wolfie\\" (to the tune of \\"Oh Johnny, Oh Johnny, Oh!\\"). The Wolf howls and chases after Cinderella, but the smitten Godmother uses various methods (usually a mallet) to keep him in line. When the clock strikes midnight, the Fairy Godmother warns Cinderella and she leaves, but not before the Wolf starts to pursue his chase. The Godmother once again tries to stop him, but this time, the Wolf uses her own methods against her and pursues Cinderella. Cinderella rushes home as the Fairy Godmother's transformation wears off, but she manages to make it home in time—it turns out that Cinderella is a Rosie the Riveter and that the reason she had to be home by midnight was so she would not be late for the night shift. Cinderella's relieved to be rid of the Wolf, but it is revealed that the bus is full of wolves, who start wolf-whistling and catcalling at her as the cartoon ends.

It is located adjacent to Lamorbey Park, the Rose Bruford College drama school and Hurstmere School. Pupils at the school are divided into a series of six houses, known as Davies, Edlmann, Lester, Townshend, Williams, and Staff, while an annual school magazine, The Chronicle, is also produced by the students. The current head teacher, Nigel Walker, has held his position since 2009. Founded as the Sidcup County School for Boys in 1931 to meet the lack of secondary schools in the newly urbanised town, it was initially opened at 27 Station Road, with the position of first headmaster being given to C. R. McGregor Williams. In 1935, the school began moving into a purpose-built site at Critall's Corner, Footscray, being renamed Chislehurst and Sidcup County School in 1938. Damaged during The Blitz, after the culmination of the Second World War, reforms implemented as a result of the Education Act 1944 led to the local decision that the institution would become a grammar school and that it would relocate to a new, larger building on Hurst Road in the Lamorbey area of Sidcup, a move that took place after the resignation of McGregor Williams in 1954. As a result of the government's Circular 10/65 in 1965, plans were implemented to merge Chislehurst and Sidcup with the neighbouring Hurstmere into a single comprehensive school, although these were opposed by the successive Conservative Party administrations of Bexley Council, eventually being scuppered under the Conservative government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s. In 1973 the school was made co-educational, admitting female pupils alongside the male, resulting in the adoption of its current name. The school rose to national headlines in January 1983 following the suspension of most of the school's sixth form for drinking alcohol at the preceding Christmas party. In 2004 it became a sports college and in 2011 an academy.  History  =Foundation: 1930= Having been an agricultural village since the Late Middle Ages, the Kentish town of Sidcup began to urbanise following the opening of Sidcup railway station on the South Eastern Railway's new Dartford Loop Line in 1866. The new transport links to central London led to increasing numbers of middle class professionals moving to the town, in particular from inner London suburbs such as Camberwell and New Cross, which were experiencing social unrest and a rise in slum housing. After the rail line's electrification following the culmination of the First World War, speculative builders bought up cheap farmland around the town and by 1930 its population had risen to just short of 12,000, and would treble within the next two decades. Sidcup's dramatic population rise led to a strain on local schooling, with many boys having to travel several miles to Dartford and Erith to attend secondary school. This problem was exacerbated by the government's stated intention of raising the school leaving age to cut the number of unemployed in the midst of the Great Depression. For this reason, the Bexley and Sidcup Urban District Councils, and later the Bromley Rural and Chislehurst District Education Committee, requested that the Maidstone- centered Kent County Council finance the creation of a new school in the area. On April 1930, the Council's Secondary and University Education Sub-Committee agreed to open up what they called the Sidcup County School for Boys on the old premises of the County School for Girls, which was then moving from its original site at 27 Station Road to a new, specially constructed site in Beaverwood Road. =27 Station Road: 1931-1935= The original site of the Sidcup County School for Boys in Station Road, Sidcup. By 2009, when this photograph was taken, the site was occupied by Bird College, devoted to dance and the performing arts. The red-brick site at 27 Station Road had been built in 1900 to house the Sidcup High School for Girls and Kindergarten, although additional office space was added in 1930 to convert it into the boys school. In July, the Secondary Education Sub-Committee began advertising to find a headmaster for the school, and in the following Spring appointed Welshman C. R. McGregor Williams (1889-1954), who had formerly been the headmaster of the recently closed Uckfield Grammar School, Sussex. The son of a tailor, McGregor Williams was born in Newport and educated at Newport High School and Cardiff College, University of Wales, where he gained a degree in modern languages. Having fought for the British Army at the Battle of the Somme, he later taught at what would become Varndean School in Brighton. He spent his spare time studying for an MA with a thesis on Molière's religious philosophy from the University of Wales and in 1926 obtained a doctorate on the poetry of John Payne from the University of Paris. Williams chose the school's motto of \\"Abeunt Studia in Mores\\", which he had taken from Ovid's Heroides, in which it is proclaimed by the poet Sappho in her love letter to Phaon. Williams also chose purple as the school's colour, supposedly because it was associated with war wounds and liturgical mourning, something that he and his wife considered appropriate following the death toll of the First World War. It was agreed that the school would initially take in 62 boys, of whom 52 would be fee- paying, 8 of whom would have free-place scholarships and 2 of which would be \\"junior exhibitioners\\". Fee-paying residents of either Kent or London counties were charged £4 a term, while \\"outsiders\\" were instead charged £10. Half of the first intake of students lived in Sidcup itself, while the others mostly came from neighbouring districts such as Petts Wood, Chislehurst, Orpington, Foots Cray and New Eltham. The school opened on Thursday 17 September 1931, with a dedication ceremony taking place on Friday 25 September. During its first year, the school began production of its own magazine, The Chronicle, while the house system was introduced in the spring term of 1932. Initially, there were only four school houses, known as A, B, C and D. In 1937, two more, E and F, were added. It would only be in 1953 that these houses were renamed. In October 1932, the school first expelled a pupil, William Duck, as punishment for allegedly spitting at passers-by from an open-top bus. Headmaster McGregor Williams was widely known for his scruffy appearance about the school. He was often stern towards the students, and implemented corporal punishment to punish disobedient pupils, beating them with a sawn-off cricket bat; he was twice prosecuted in court for using excessive force in this manner, but was acquitted on both occasions. A staunch supporter of the Conservative Party, he adored drama and took part in some of the school's early performances, as well as introducing the sport of lacrosse to the school, of which he was a keen fan. In July 1933, the school's first foreign trip went ahead, with McGregor Williams taking pupils to the Rhineland in Germany. At the time under the control of the Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler, the school continued taking pupils to the region in future years; in 1937 McGregor Williams and his pupils traveled the country wearing swastika armbands which they had been given by members of the Hitler Youth movement. =Crittall's Corner: 1935-1954= The old building at 27 Station Road had always been intended as a temporary site for the school, with a larger, purpose-built building planned for construction at Crittall's Corner, just south of the town. The first wing of the new building opened on 11 November 1935, and for a while the school remained divided between the two sites, with students often having to travel across Sidcup to get to different lessons. Construction of the building only came to an end in 1938, when the school was moved in its entirety to the new site. The new building, designed by John Poltock - who would later design Cairo's Victoria College - was a modernist construct known for its prominent use of large metal-framed windows that allowed the building to be filled with natural light. Designed to house 660 students, more than were currently enrolled in the school, it was widely acclaimed both in architectural journals and in the popular press. It was also in 1935 that the school introduced purple blazers for uniforms, although the majority of students continued to wear their grey blazers; it would only be in the 1950s that the school's students had gone entirely over to purple. In 1938, the school was renamed Chislehurst and Sidcup County School; this was because the Sidcup Urban District Council had been abolished in 1934, its role being adopted by the newly created Chislehurst and Sidcup Urban District Council. In 1939, Britain entered the Second World War, and a number of the school's teachers were called up to fight in the British Army. Headmaster McGregor Williams meanwhile joined the Home Guard, eventually becoming the head of the Chislehurst platoon. At the school, the students set about digging out trenches to use as bomb shelters and assemblies were cancelled. Students were expected to carry their gas masks around with them in case of chemical attack, and during the ensuing Blitz - in which the German Luftwaffe began bombing London and the areas around it - the school was affected by a nearby landmine on 17 September 1940, destroying the glass of all the windows on one side. On 16 June 1944, the school was once more struck, this time by a V-1 flying bomb which destroyed one end of the Assembly Hall; much of the damage to the school would not be permanently repaired until 1951. By the time that the war came to an end in 1945, 280 former pupils and 13 members of staff had fought in the armed forces, with 45 of them having been killed. In 1944, Conservative politician Rab Butler put forward the Education Act 1944, suggesting a large- scale reform of British schools by introducing a \\"tripartite system\\" that divided students based on their academic ability and allocating them to one of three schools: the grammar school, secondary technical school and secondary modern school.Wells 2002. p. 71. Deciding how to implement these reforms on a local scale, in 1946, E. V. Mills chaired a meeting of the Divisional Executive in which they suggested radically changing the schooling system in the area. They decided that Chislehurst and Sidcup County School would become a grammar, and would be moved from its site at Critall's Corner to a much larger space at Lamorbey in Sidcup, where it would be situated alongside a newly built technical school, Hurstmere School. Meanwhile, the site at Critall's Corner would be converted into a secondary modern, which would later be known as Kemnal Technology College. This was partly to alleviate problems of overcrowding; the population of the local area had tripled since 1931, and the Critall's Corner building was taking in more than the number of students that it had been built to accommodate. The decision to move the school was deeply opposed by Headmaster McGregor Williams, who wanted his school to remain within the Critall's Corner building, of which he was particularly fond; he wrote letters to Members of Parliament suggesting expansion at the present site, but to no avail. He decided to retire prior to the move to the new site, stepping down in July 1953, and dying five months later. Meanwhile, academic achievement at the school remained high in the post-war years, with a large percentage of pupils going on to gain university degrees. Of note is that the July 1946 issue of The Chronicle contained several illustrations by a student, Quentin Blake, later to become a famous illustrator. Blake subsequently became the magazine's editor, a position he retained from 1949 to 1951. = Hurst Road, Sidcup 1954-67= The entrance to the Hurst Road site The new building had been constructed on land once belonging to the Medieval manor of Lamorbey House. The manor house to which the school was now adjacent had been rebuilt in the eighteenth century and by 1950 was housing Rose Bruford College. Chis and Sid's new building was designed by Howard C. Lobb & Partners of Gower Street, in conjunction with the Kent County Architects S. H. Loweth and E. T. Ashley Smith. As a result of post-war austerity, the building was constructed on a tight budget of under £300,000, and consisted of reinforced concrete and portal frames, with a brickwork finished. The design was largely deemed to be aesthetically unpleasing by both students and staff, although it did allow them access to twice as much land as they had had at Crittal's Corner. Opening in 1954, it was officially opened in a ceremony led by the Lord Lieutenant of Kent and the Bishop of Rochester. As part of the move, in September 1954 it had been decided that the school houses would be renamed as Davies, Edlmann, Williams, Staff, Townshend, and Lester, all figures who had played a prominent role in the school's history. The move also saw a change in the school's winter sport from football to rugby, although cricket remained the school's summer sport. The new headmaster was Richard \\"Dick\\" Pedley (1912-1973); born in Dorset, Pedley had studied English at Downing College, Cambridge before serving in the Royal Artillery during World War II. Prior to becoming Head at Chis and Sid he had taught at City Boys' School, Leicester and St. Olave's School, Southwark. Fiercely competitive, he encouraged a heightened spirit of competitiveness within the school, strongly emphasising academic achievement with the intent of getting as many students as possible to go on to study at Oxford University or Cambridge University. His success in this aim led to the school attaining a national reputation, and within the maintained school sector, only Harrow College rivaled its achievements. Opinions about Pedley among staff varied greatly however, because his autocratic management style was criticised for achieving success for some pupils at the expense of others. In 1965, the London Government Act 1963 came into force, transferring Chis and Sid from the county of Kent to the newly created Greater London. Now part of the London Borough of Bexley, it lost access to three quarters of its former catchment area, which remained under the jurisdiction of Kent County Council. Further change came under the Labour Party government of Prime Minister Harold Wilson, whose Secretary of State for Education, Anthony Crossland, outlined plans to replace the country's tripartite system of secondary education with the egalitarian comprehensive school system. The Labour-run Bexley Council agreed to this project, pushing ahead with plans to convert Chis and Sid into a comprehensive, as part of which it would be merged with the neighbouring Hurstmere in 1969. Pedley was a vocal critic of the comprehensive system on both a national and a local level. He fought the council's plans to convert the school, and was supported by a unanimous resolution passed by staff and by a Parents' Association founded in 1966. When the council nevertheless approved the plan in May 1967, Pedley resigned as headmaster in protest. =Looming comprehensivisation and co-educational status: 1967-79= Pedley was succeeded by Michael Brown (b.1927), who had previously worked as Headmaster of Prescot Grammar School. Born in Lancaster, Brown was a lay Methodist preacher who had a degree in History from Emmanuel College, Cambridge and a master's degree in Theology from St Peter's College, Oxford. Although staff found him to be courteous, modest, and a good listener - unlike his predecessors - they were largely unhappy that he was a supporter of the comprehensive system. Despite staff fears that his egalitarian ethos would promote mediocrity, admissions to Oxford and Cambridge actually rose under Brown's leadership. In April 1968, the Conservatives took control of Bexley council and scrapped plans to merge Chis and Sid and Hurstmere into a single comprehensive. However, still obliged by central government to abolish the eleven plus exam which had allocated primary school children to a particular form of secondary school under the tripartite system, a compromise was developed. Chis and Sid was to officially cease to be a grammar school, although it would still be able to choose which students it would accept based on their academic ability. At the same time it was decided that Chis and Sid was to become co-educational and thus admit girls as well as boys. The need for this latter change had become acute; the 1960s boundary changes had left the London Borough of Bexley with no grammar schools for girls and only one co-educational grammar (Bexley Grammar School), while the neighbouring London Borough of Bromley now had five grammars for girls. As Secretary of State for Education, Margaret Thatcher (pictured) prevented Bexley Council's plans to merge Chis and Sid and Hurstmere into a single comprehensive school In 1971, Labour regained Bexley Council and pushed forward with the plan to merge Chis and Sid and Hurstmere into a single comprehensive, although in May 1972 this plan was denied permission to proceed by the Conservative Secretary of State for Education, Margaret Thatcher. As a step toward the ultimate establishment of comprehensive education throughout the borough, in 1973 the council announced plans to remove the words \\"secondary modern\\", \\"technical high\\", and \\"grammar\\" from all schools under their jurisdiction, resulting in protests from both staff and the parents' association at Chis and Sid. In 1974, the Conservatives then regained the council, proceeding to effectively ignore Labour's 1976 Education Act that required the comprehensivisation of all secondary education. The chair of Bexley's Educational Committee, Brian Sams, insisted that the borough would not implement the legally required changes until every school in the area had the facilities capable of supporting a \\"curriculum adapted to the needs of pupils of all abilities\\". In the 1979 general election, Thatcher was elected Prime Minister, and the pressure for comprehensivisation from central government ceased, allowing Bexley Borough to continue using the grammar school system. On 4 May 1971, four home-made bombs were found in the woods adjoining the school. The authorities suspected that these belonged to the far left militant group known as Angry Brigade.Bombs listed as being possibly the result of the Angry Brigade 1972 witnessed Chislehurst and Sidcup's first school trip outside Europe, as 150 boys traveled to New York City. Soon after, the wearing of caps as part of the school uniform was abolished. Links were established between Chis and Sid and the nearby Marlborough Special School for children with special needs, while in 1974 the school's literary society secured Kenneth Williams to speak to them. The first girls arrived at the school in September 1973, representing the sixty female pupils who had the highest test scores from the local primary system. Accordingly, the term \\"for Boys\\" was removed from the school's name, while hockey and netball were introduced as sports for the girls to play. Some resentment arose however over the issue of punishment; while boys were still exposed to corporal punishment in the form of caning and (unofficial) slapping, girls were exempt from these measures. During the general election of 1974, the BBC filmed their election count, presented by David Dimbleby, from the school's main hall, having chosen the building because it was located in the parliamentary constituency of Old Bexley and Sidcup, which was the seat represented by the sitting Conservative Prime Minister Edward Heath. After losing that election to Labour, Heath spoke to the school's pupils at the following speech day. In 1975, an additional building, the New Block was constructed on a very tight budget. =\\"Sozzlehurst and Hiccup\\": 1980-1999= The Sun newspaper published this satirical cartoon depicting the events of December 1982 in which they labelled the school \\"Sozzlehurst and Hiccup\\". Historian Charles Wells would note that by 2002 it had become \\"famous - or notorious\\". In April 1977, John Sennett (b.1934) was introduced as the new headmaster. Born in Plymouth, he had studied History at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge and subsequently taught at Manchester Grammar School. A Quaker and pacifist, he had refused to serve his national service, resulting in some initial suspicion about him, however his support for the grammar school system and his conscientious, genial nature enabled him to get along with the school's staff. In 1981, the school celebrated its golden jubilee with a variety of events, including a Jubilee Walk that took in both Station Road and Crittal's Corner; these activities were used to raise money for an extension to the school's library. That year's school play, a performance of William Shakespeare's As You Like It, was directed by English teacher John Hazelgrove and won Bexley Arts Trophy's Best Play of the Year award, beating a variety of adult drama groups. In December 1982, sixth formers held a morning Christmas party in the sixth-form centre, during which alcohol was consumed. One pupil fell over and was taken away by ambulance with minor injuries, while another pupil was sent home for being drunk. During the ensuing Christmas holidays, Sennet decided that he should punish those who had been involved in the party. In January 1983, at the start of the spring term, he requested written confessions of guilt from those who had consumed alcohol, stating that this would result in a one-day suspension, with 160 pupils producing such confessions. At this point he changed his mind, deciding that he would provide different degrees of punishment based on the quantity of alcohol that each student individually consumed. The sixth form body refused to accept this, deeming it to be a form of victimisation, and so insisted that it be judged as a collective and punished accordingly. Sennet then suspended all 160 pupils for a day. Somebody had contacted a British tabloid, The Sun, to inform them of the events, and being a slow news day, they ran the incident on their front page, proclaiming \\"School Band 157 Boozing Pupils\\". The journalist responsible, Robert Bolton, added fresh elements to the story, claiming that 5 students had had to be taken to hospital as a result of their drinking, while others had smoked marijuana. Soon, other newspapers had picked up on the story, with journalists offering £5 to students outside the school gates who could provide the most lurid and sensationalist accounts of the events. As a result, The Star went with the headline \\"Sixth Form Banned After Brandy Orgy\\" while Daily Express decided on \\"The Day my Sixth Form went Wild\\". Broadsheet The Daily Telegraph also reported on the story, but only gave it a few paragraphs under the title of \\"160 Pupils Suspended after Party\\". Reporters from the BBC local news picked up on it, while the following day, The Sun returned to the story with an editorial cartoon by Franklin in which the school was referred to as \\"Sozzlehurst and Hiccup\\". According to historian Charles Wells, the event represented \\"the School's one undeniable moment of national fame\\". The school (visible in centre ground) has a number of sports fields, some shared with neighbouring Hurstmere School The period between 1983 and 1994 witnessed a rapid array of initiatives introduced by the Conservative government, including GCSEs, the Baker Contract, AS levels, a national curriculum with key stages and attainment targets, local financial management, grant maintained status, SATs, OFSTED inspections, staff appraisal, and coursework examination, all of which caused a great deal of disruption to the school and contributed to an increased turnover of new staff in this period, with many new teachers swiftly exiting the profession. Wells suggested that this chaotic educational environment resulted in more difficulties for Chis and Sid than at any point in its history except during World War II. The school also witnessed a small decline in the grades achieved by its pupils, in part due to the increasingly localised and concomitantly decreasingly selective nature of admissions, although this decline was greatly exaggerated by the local press. In 1986, corporal punishment was abolished in state schools, including at Chis and Sid. That year, the school won its second Bexley Arts Council Award for their adaptation of Oh What a Lovely War, again directed by Hazelgrove. In 1984 the school celebrated the first red nose day, raising £6000 for charities aiding Ethiopian famine victims, while in 1990 it held its first non uniform day to raise money for charity, an event that became a regular institution in the school. On 11 July 1992, one of the school's pupils, Rohit Duggal, was stabbed to death in Eltham, with a tree being planted in his memory outside the dining hall. In 1994, James 'Jim' Rouncefield (b.1951) was appointed headteacher. Born in Redruth, Cornwall, Rouncefield had studied Geography at Goldsmiths College and prior to getting the Chis and Sid job had worked as head of Chatham Grammar School for Boys. Shortly after he started his tenure, the school experienced its first OFSTED inspection, which criticised the condition of the building and endorsed a reduction in the staffing budget, resulting in subsequent staff being hired on lower wages but with higher workloads. In 1996 a new sixth form centre was opened, having cost £100,000 to construct, while in 1997 personal computers were installed in the library, and in 1998 a tannoy system was installed in the school. That year, a second OFSTED inspection concluded that the school had greatly improved since 1994. In December 1999 a newly rebuilt Music Block was ceremonially opened by the Mayor of Bexley, and in 2000 the roof of the New Block was replaced. The school then embarked on plans to construct a new sports block, the Jubilee Pavilion, and sought sports college status. =Since 2000= In 2004, Jim Rouncefield left his post as Headmaster and Dr Joe Vitagliano took over. The school soon gained joint sports college status with the neighbouring Hurstmere School and in 2004 the Jubilee Pavilion was built primarily for sports (it contained changing rooms and a dance studio). By early 2006 the 'old' school logo was abolished and a new adaptation was introduced. The Jubilee Pavilion sports block, constructed in the 2000s A few years later the Quentin Blake Block was built for £3.5 million for the Art and Design Departments, which contained within it the Curve Gallery, which has since held an annual exhibition of student art, along with various other exhibitions (including a retrospective of the work of local artist Bill Hudson, entitled \\"Routes\\"). On 1 October 2008, Mayor of London and former Conservative MP Boris Johnson visited the school to officially open the new sports centre. In 2009, Vitagliano left and Mr Nigel Walker, the former deputy head, took over his position. Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, opens new sixth form centre On 5 November 2009, a team composed of former students from the class of 2004 named \\"Sozzlehurst and Hiccup\\" competed on BBC Two quiz show Eggheads, losing narrowly in the final round.Eggheads Series 10 Episode 96, first aired 5 November 2009 The school converted to academy status on 1 September 2011. After conversion to academy status the school underwent various building and renovation projects. During the summer holidays of 2012 the school driveway was renovated with the inclusion of gates and railings to separate students from the road. The new gates were designed by pupils through a competition run by the school. The following academic year the windows in the main building were all replaced with double glazing to improve efficiency and comfort. In 2013 the school bought the BMW Group Pavilion Building, which stood in the 2012 London Olympic Park, for £1. The building became the new site for the Sixth Form and Marlborough Special Needs School, as well as the Business, Economics and Psychology departments. Construction of the building began in the summer of 2014 and was officially opened on 3 March 2016 by Mayor of London Boris Johnson. After opening the building the old study centre was converted into the Learning Support Room. The library was also closed, with the study area being converted to a classroom, and the library being refurbished with new furniture. From mid-2014 until late-2016 improvement works took place throughout the majority of the school to replace an ageing pipework and central heating system. This was funded by £1.5 million from the Community Improvement Fund. Pipework was replaced in the main building, humanities block, and the music block. In December 2014 the school acquired planning permission for a new performing arts centre, to be built on the site of the existing Marlborough School classrooms. The proposed building was to include classrooms and performance areas for drama and music students. Also included in the planning application are supplemental projects to extend part of the existing Jubilee Pavilion, and demolish an existing drama classroom to expand the canteen. However, new permission was granted in 2016 for a single story building, to provide two drama studios and 4 general classrooms. This superseded the previously granted planning permission. Work on these projects began in January 2017. These works were completed by September and in use at the beginning at the school academic year.

Sea smoke over Lake Superior, Duluth, Minnesota. January 5, 2017 Sea smoke, frost smoke, or steam fog is fog which is formed when very cold air moves over warmer water. Arctic sea smoke is sea smoke forming over small patches of open water in sea ice.Mark Nuttall, Encyclopedia of the Arctic, p. 2163, Routledge, 2012 . It forms when a light wind of very cold air mixes with a shallow layer of saturated warm air immediately above the warmer water. The warmer air is cooled beyond the dew point and can no longer hold as much water vapor, so the excess condenses out. The effect is similar to the \\"steam\\" produced over a hot bath or a hot drink, or even an exercising person. Sea smoke has a turbulent appearance and may form spiralling columns.H. U. Roll, Physics of the marine atmosphere, p. 359, Academic Press, 1965 . It is usually not very high and lookouts on ships can usually see over it (but small boats may have very poor visibility)Hank Halsted, \\"Fog\\", Motorboating and Sailing, pp. 41-42, August 1982 because the fog is confined to the layer of warm air above the sea. However, sea smoke columns 20–30 m (70–100 ft) high have been observed.

It is rooted on Norwegian black/Viking metal and experimental rock on some tracks, and named after the large fortress Isengard in J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings book series. History The person/creature in Isengard's logo was taken from an old Lord of the Rings RPG called Middle-earth Role Playing. The original illustration represents Thuringwethil, the vampire from Tolkien's book The Silmarillion. Fenriz created Isengard because he had many musical ideas that did not fit in with the style and music of Darkthrone. Fenriz performed all instruments and vocals himself. Vinterskugge is a compilation of three demos recorded before the full-length album Høstmørke was recorded. When asked how he felt about Isengard in a November 2007 interview, Fenriz commented that he doesn't \\"understand why people like it so much\\". He stated that people like \\"the elements\\" which he doesn't like, namely the project's folk metal aspect. In 2016, Peaceville Records issued a two-song 7\\" entitled \\"Traditional Doom Cult\\".

Begun as the ocean liner in 1939, she was purchased by the Navy Ministry in 1941 for conversion to an aircraft carrier. Completed shortly after the Battle of Midway in June 1942, she participated in the Guadalcanal Campaign, but missed the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands in October because of an electrical generator fire. The carrier's aircraft were disembarked several times and used from land bases in battles in the South West Pacific. Hiyō was torpedoed in mid-1943 and spent three months under repair. She spent most of the next six months training and ferrying aircraft before returning to combat. She was sunk by a gasoline- vapour explosion caused by an American torpedo hit during the Battle of the Philippine Sea on 20 June 1944 with the loss of 247 officers and ratings, about a fifth of her complement. Design and description The ship was ordered as the fast luxury passenger liner Izumo Maru by Nippon Yusen Kaisha (Japan Mail Steamship Company) in late 1938. In exchange for a 60 per cent subsidy of her building costs by the Navy Ministry, she was designed to be converted to an aircraft carrier in the event of war. The designs of Izumo Maru and her sister ship Kashiwara Maru were based on the German ocean liner , although they were only about half that ship's size at . If completed as designed, they would have been the largest ocean liners in Japan. The ships were designed to carry a total of 890 passengers; 220 first class, 120 second class and 550 third class.Lengerer & Rehm-Takahara, pp. 17, 19, 106 After her conversion, Hiyō had a length of overall. She had a beam of and a draught of . She displaced at standard load.Lengerer & Rehm-Takahara, p. 107 Her crew ranged from 1,187 to 1,224 officers and ratings.Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, p. 52 The ship was fitted with a pair of Mitsubishi-Curtis geared steam turbine sets with a total of , each driving one propeller, using steam provided by six Kawasaki-LaMont boilers. Hiyō had a designed speed of and slightly exceeded that during sea trials. The ship carried enough fuel oil to give her a range of at .Lengerer & Rehm-Takahara, pp. 189–190 =Flight deck arrangements= Aft view of the flight deck of her sister ship from the island, 19 October 1945 Hiyōs flight deck was long and had a maximum width of . The ship was designed with two superimposed hangars, each approximately long, wide and high. Each hangar could be subdivided by four fire curtains and they had fire fighting foam dispensers on each side. The hangars were served by two aircraft lifts.Lengerer & Rehm-Takahara, pp. 108–114 Her air group was initially intended to consist of 12 Mitsubishi A5M \\"Claude\\" fighters, plus four in storage, 18 Aichi D3A \\"Val\\" dive bombers, plus two in storage, and 18 Nakajima B5N \\"Kate\\" torpedo bombers. This was revised to substitute a dozen Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters and three in storage for the A5Ms by the time the ship was commissioned in 1942. As a result of the lessons learnt from the Battle of Midway in June, the fighter complement was increased to 21 Zeros and the B5Ns were reduced to 9. By the end of the year, 6 more Zeros replaced an equal number of D3As, giving totals of 27 A6Ms, 12 D3As and 9 B5Ns. Although it was possible to fit all these aircraft into the hangars, 8 or 9 were usually stored on the flight deck to reduce congestion below decks.Lengerer & Rehm- Takahara, p. 111 =Armour, armament and sensors= As a conversion from an ocean liner, it was not possible to add much armour, although the ship had a double hull. Two plates of Ducol steel, each thick, protected the sides of the ship's machinery spaces. The ship's aviation gasoline tanks and magazines were protected by one layer of Ducol steel. Her machinery spaces were further subdivided by transverse and longitudinal bulkheads to limit any flooding.Lengerer & Rehm-Takahara, p. 188 The ship's primary armament consisted of a dozen Type 89 dual-purpose guns in twin mounts on sponsons along the sides of the hull. Hiyō was also initially equipped with eight triple mounts for 2.5 cm Type 96 light AA guns alongside the flight deck. This was the standard Japanese light AA gun during World War II but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it a largely ineffective weapon. According to historian Mark Stille, the twin and triple mounts \\"lacked sufficient speed in train or elevation; the gun sights were unable to handle fast targets; the gun exhibited excessive vibration; the magazine was too small, and, finally, the gun produced excessive muzzle blast\\".Stille, p. 8 In early 1943, four more triple mounts were added and another four triple mounts were added late in the year. Two of these last four mounts were mounted on the stern and the others were placed in front of and behind the island. A dozen single mounts were also added, some of which were portable and could be mounted on tie-down points on the flight deck.Lengerer & Rehm-Takahara, pp. 188, 193 Two Type 94 high-angle fire-control directors, one on each side of the ship, were fitted to control the Type 89 guns. Four Type 95 directors controlled the 2.5 cm guns and another pair were added in early 1943. Early warning was provided by two Type 2, Mark 2, Model 1 early-warning radars. The first of these was mounted on the top of the island shortly before she was completed in July 1942 and the other was added later in the year. This latter system was fitted on the port side of the hull, outboard of the aft lift.Lengerer & Rehm-Takahara, pp. 188–189, 193 A smaller Type 3, Mark 1, Model 3 early-warning radar was added in 1944.Stille, p. 23 Construction and career Hiyō was laid down on 30 November 1939 by Kawasaki on Slipway No. 4 at their shipyard in Kobe. She was yard number 660 and had the name Izumo Maru. The ship was purchased on 10 February 1941 by the Navy Ministry and she was temporarily referred to as No. 1002 Ship (Dai 1002 bankan) to keep her conversion secret. She was launched on 24 June 1941 and commissioned on 31 July 1942 with Captain Akitomo Beppu in command.Lengerer & Rehm-Takahara, pp. 17, 106–107 The ship was assigned to the Second Carrier Division of the 1st Air Fleet after commissioning and became flagship of Rear Admiral Kakuji Kakuta on 12 August. After spending the next few months working up, Hiyō arrived at Truk, together with her sister Jun'yō, on 9 October, to begin operations against American forces in the Guadalcanal area as part of the 3rd Fleet.Tully & Casse On the night of 16 October, the two carriers were ordered to attack the American transports off Lunga Point, Guadalcanal, and they moved south to their launching point north of Lunga. At 05:15 local each ship launched nine A6M Zeros and nine B5Ns. One of Jun'yōs B5Ns was forced to turn back with mechanical problems; the rest reached their objective and discovered two destroyers bombarding Japanese supply dumps on Guadalcanal around 07:20. Hiyōs aircraft attacked seven minutes later without effect, and the American ship shot down one B5N and damaged another which was forced to make a crash landing. Jun'yōs eight B5Ns engaged and also failed to hit their target, not least because they were attacked by Marine Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters at 07:32. The Marine pilots shot down three B5Ns on their first pass and severely damaged another pair which were also forced to crash-land. The US fighters then shot down the three remaining bombers after they missed Lardner. The defending Zeros were able to shoot down only one Wildcat at the cost of one of Hiyōs fighters forced to crash land, although they claimed to have shot down thirteen Marine fighters.Lundstrom, pp. 318–319 A fire in the ship's generator room occurred on 21 October and reduced her top speed to so Kakuta transferred his flag to Jun'yō while Hiyō returned to Truk for repairs. Three Zeros, one D3A and five B5Ns were also transferred to Jun'yō before she left. The remaining aircraft of her air group (16 Zeros and 17 D3As) were flown off for Rabaul, on the island of New Britain, on 23 October, from where the fighters escorted bombers attacking Guadalcanal the following day. A detachment from the air group was transferred to Buin, New Guinea, on 1 November and attacked American ships off Lunga Point on 11 November. Escorted by 18 Zeros from Hiyō and the 204th Naval Air Group, 9 D3As slightly damaged three cargo ships in exchange for 4 dive bombers shot down and another forced to crash land. The Zeros were able to ambush six Wildcats in the heavy cloud and shot down four while losing two of their own. That same day, those aircraft that remained at Rabaul flew back to Truk, but the Buin detachment remained there until 14 December when they were ferried back to Japan. Captain Michio Sumikawa relieved Beppu on 30 November.Hata, Izawa & Shores, pp. 43, 133; Lundstrom, p. 472 Hiyō spent November in Truk before returning to Japan in early December where she was rejoined by the rest of her air group. Aside from a brief refit at Kure from 26 February to 4 March 1943 that saw her anti-aircraft armament augmented and an additional radar installed, the ship was training in the Inland Sea until she sailed for Truk on 22 March. Her air group consisted of 27 Zeros and 12 D3As and they were detached from Hiyō in early April to participate in Operation I-Go, a land-based aerial offensive against Allied bases in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea. On 7 April her aircraft formed most of the third wave of attacks on Guadalcanal. Escorted by 24 Zeros from Hiyō and another 6 from the light carrier , the D3As attacked shipping in the Sealark Channel. The escorts claimed to have shot down three American aircraft for the loss of one Zero and three dive bombers.Hata, Izawa & Shores, pp. 51–52 Allied naval losses during the entire day included Aaron Ward, the oil tanker , the minesweeper and damage to a transport and another tanker, although it is uncertain which aircraft sank or damaged each ship.Rohwer, p. 244 A second series of attacks was made against Oro Bay, New Guinea, on 11 April. Jun'yōs 9 Zeros, together with Hiyōs 21 fighters, escorted the latter's D3As. One defending fighter was claimed for the loss of a single dive bomber. The following day, 17 of Hiyōs Zeros provided top cover for several waves of attacks on Port Moresby, New Guinea, her pilots claiming nine victories without losing any of their own. On 14 April, the Japanese attacked Milne Bay, New Guinea, with a large force escorted by 75 Zeros contributed by all the carriers involved. Hiyōs fighter pilots claimed to have shot down three Allied aircraft without loss and the bombers sank two transports. Her air group returned to Truk by 18 April to rejoin the ship.Hata, Izawa & Shores, pp. 53–54; Rohwer, p. 244 Jun'yō at anchor, late 1945 In response to the invasion of Attu Island on 11 May, the Second Carrier Division departed Truk, accompanied by three battleships and two heavy cruisers and reached Japan on 25 May. The Americans recaptured Attu before the fleet could depart to counter-attack. Now the flagship of the Second Carrier Division under Rear Admiral Munetaka Sakamaki, Hiyō departed Yokosuka on 7 June with Junyō en route for Truk. Later that evening, the ship was torpedoed by the submarine off Miyakejima. Hits in the starboard bow and boiler room knocked out all power but she managed to return to Japan the following day after restoring power. Hiyōs fighters were flown to Truk by 15 July and assigned to the light carrier , as were Sakamaki and his staff. While being repaired at Yokosuka until 15 September, more 2.5 cm Type 96 AA guns were installed, and Sumikawa was relieved by Captain Tamotsu Furukawa on 1 September.Hata, Izawa & Shores, p. 133 Two months later, Hiyōs air group was reconstituted in Singapore with 24 Zeros, 18 D3As and 9 B5Ns; the ship departed Japan for Singapore on 24 November. She arrived on 3 December, loaded her air group and was almost immediately assigned duties as an aircraft ferry. On 9 December, Hiyō left Singapore en route for Truk with several deliveries on the way. The ship arrived there on 22 December and disembarked her aircraft before proceeding to Saipan to deliver more aircraft. The air group was transferred to Kavieng and later Rabaul to provide air cover for Japanese operations there where the fighters claimed 80 victories in exchange for 12 losses.Hata, Izawa & Shores, pp. 133–134 Hiyō returned to Japan on 1 January 1944 and Furukawa was relieved by Captain Toshiyuki Yokoi on 15 February. Her air group was reassigned to her on 2 March, albeit without aircraft. The Japanese Navy had restructured its carrier air groups so that one air group was assigned to one carrier division and the 652nd Naval Air Group was assigned to the Second Carrier Division with Hiyō, Jun'yō and Ryūhō. The air group was the last to be rebuilt; it had only 30 Model 21 Zeros, 13 Model 52 Zeros and four D3As on hand on 1 April of its authorised 81 fighters, 36 dive bombers and 27 torpedo bombers. The ship conducted training for her aircraft in the Inland Sea until 11 May when she sailed for Tawi-Tawi in the Philippines.Hata, Izawa & Shores, p. 235 The new base was closer to the oil wells in Borneo on which the Navy relied for fuel and also to the Palau and western Caroline Islands, where the Japanese expected the next American attack. The location lacked an airfield on which to train the green pilots and American submarines were very active in the vicinity which restricted the ships to the anchorage.Polmar & Genda, pp. 380–381 =Battle of the Philippine Sea= The Japanese fleet was en route to Guimaras Island in the central Philippines on 13 June 1944 where it intended to practice carrier operations in an area better protected from submarines, when Vice-Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa learnt of the American attack on the Mariana Islands the previous day. Upon reaching Guimaras, the fleet refuelled and sortied into the Philippine Sea where it spotted Task Force 58 on 18 June. The Americans failed to detect the Japanese ships that day. Ozawa decided to launch his air strikes early the following morning so the Japanese turned south to maintain a constant distance between them and the American carriers. The 652nd Naval Air Group had 81 Zeros, 27 D3As, 9 Yokosuka D4Y \\"Judy\\" dive bombers and 18 Nakajima B6N \\"Jill\\" torpedo bombers, roughly evenly divided among the three carriers under his command. The carriers began launching their first air strike of 26 bomb-carrying A6M2 Zeros, 7 B6Ns and 16 A6M5 Zeros as escorts around 09:30. Most of these aircraft were misdirected and failed to find any American ships, although a dozen persisted in their search and found one of the American task groups. A B6N, 5 bomb-carrying Zeros and an escort Zero were shot down by the defending fighters and no damage was inflicted on the American ships.Brown, pp. 252, 257–261 A second air strike of 27 D3As, 9 D4Ys, 2 B6Ns and 26 escorting Zeros was launched around 11:00, accompanied by at least 18 A6Ms and B6Ns from the carriers and . They had also been given an erroneous spot report and were unable to find any American ships. Some of the aircraft headed for airfields at Rota and Guam to refuel while the remainder headed back to the carriers. A pair of Zeros and six D4Ys bound for Rota spotted the carriers and en route, but failed to inflict any damage on them while losing five D4Ys to anti-aircraft fire. Radar had spotted those aircraft headed for Guam and they were intercepted by 41 Grumman F6F Hellcats. Only an A6M5, a D4Y and seven D3As of the 49 Japanese aircraft survived the encounter and landed.Brown, pp. 261–262 At dusk, the Japanese turned away to the north west to regroup and to refuel and the Americans turned west to close the distance. They discovered the retiring Japanese fleet during the afternoon of the following day and Vice-Admiral Marc Mitscher ordered an air strike.Brown, pp. 263–264 Hiyō was struck by two bombs, one of which detonated above the bridge and killed or wounded virtually everyone there. More seriously, the ship was struck by one torpedo dropped by a Grumman TBF Avenger from the light carrier . The torpedo knocked out the starboard engine room and started fires but Hiyō was able to continue, at reduced speed. Two hours later, a large explosion occurred when leaking gasoline vapour ignited and knocked out all power on the ship. The fires raged out of control and Hiyō sank stern first shortly afterwards at .Lengerer & Rehm-Takahara, p. 193 Roughly 1,200 men were rescued by her escorting destroyers, but 247 officers and ratings died aboard the carrier.

Stone piers of the 1866 P.W. & B. Railroad Bridge can be seen in the foreground. Other bridges visible upstream are, front to back: the Thomas J. Hatem Memorial Bridge (U.S. Route 40), the CSX Susquehanna River Bridge, and the Millard E. Tydings Memorial Bridge (I-95). The Amtrak Susquehanna River Bridge is a Howe deck truss structure that carries two tracks of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor line across the Susquehanna River between Havre de Grace and Perryville, Maryland.  History  The vicinity of the bridge has been used as a river crossing for more than 300 years. In 1695, the colonial General Assembly granted the first licenses to operate a ferry between Perryville and what is now Havre de Grace. In 1837, railroad lines south from Wilmington, Delaware, and north from Baltimore arrived at the riverbanks. For 29 years, including the duration of the American Civil War, a train ferry carried passengers (on foot) and freight cars between the two towns. In 1854, a larger ferryboat began to transport entire passenger cars across the river. In 1866, after 12 years of intermittent construction, the Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore Railroad (PW&B;) completed a wooden single-track railroad bridge. Iron reinforcements were added between 1874 and 1880. In 1881, when the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) formally took control of the PW&B;, it cut rival Baltimore & Ohio Railroad's access to the PW&B.; The B&O; was forced to construct a parallel route between Baltimore and Philadelphia, including a new bridge about upstream. In 1904-06, the PRR replaced the PW&B; crossing with a new bridge just a few yards upstream. Opened on May 29, 1906, it includes a center swing span to increase vertical clearance for water traffic from the nominal . In 1934, the PRR began installing catenary on the span to help extend 11,000-volt electrification south from Wilmington to Washington, D.C. Regular electrified passenger service across the bridge began on February 10, 1935. Ownership of the bridge passed to Amtrak in 1976 when it acquired much of the Northeast Corridor infrastructure.  Present status  About 100 Amtrak and MARC passenger trains cross the bridge each weekday at a speed of ; about 12 freight trains a day cross at a speed of . Freight traffic, operated by Norfolk Southern Railway under a trackage rights agreement, is generally restricted to nighttime hours to avoid interfering with passenger operations. The only significant commercial water traffic under the bridge consists of barges from a large granite quarry just upstream of Havre de Grace. The bridge's swing span rarely needs to be opened; vessels that require such an opening must provide 24-hour advance notice. In 2005 and 2007, Amtrak replaced the ties on the bridge, installed continuous welded rail, and installed new deck-level maintenance walkways, changes meant to extend the life of the bridge by 20 to 25 years. In May 2011, the U.S. Department of Transportation announced $22 million in funding for engineering and environmental work to replace the bridge. The Bush River and Gunpowder River bridges, two spans of similar age on the Northeast Corridor in Maryland, are also under consideration for replacement. The project study began in 2013 and was completed in 2017. Amtrak has identified the bridge replacement as one of their 'Ready To Build' projects for the Northeast Corridor.

The type species, Fukuisaurus tetoriensis, was described in 2003 by Yoshitsugu Kobayashi and Yoichi Azuma. The genus name refers to Fukui; the specific name to the geological Tetori Group. The type specimens or cotypes are FPDM-V-40-1, a right maxilla, and FPDM-V-40-2, a right jugal. Further elements of a skull and a right sternal plate had been recovered.Kobayashi, Y. and Azuma, Y.

Description Reconstructed skeleton with holotype fossils in lower right Fukuisaurus was a relatively small ornithopod. In 2010 Gregory S. Paul estimated its length at 4.5 meters and its weight at 400 kg.Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 286 Being a bipedal, optionally quadrupedal, animal, it was similar in general build to Iguanodon, Ouranosaurus and Altirhinus. According to the describers Fukuisaurus was exceptional in that its skull was not kinetic: the tooth-bearing maxilla would be so strongly fused to the vomer that a sideways chewing motion would have been impossible. Classification Fukuisaurus was assigned by its describers to Iguanodontia, although the presence of a posterolateral process of the sternum indicated that it likely also belongs to Styracosterna. Their cladistic analysis showed that Fukuisaurus was more derived than Iguanodon and Ouranosaurus, but less derived than Altirhinus. Ramírez-Velasco et al. (2012) found Fukuisaurus to be a basal member of Hadrosauroidea, while Bertozzo et al. (2017) recovered it as a non-hadrosauroid styracostern.

It consists of a bus station on Stamford New Road, a Northern Trains- operated heavy rail station on the Mid-Cheshire Line, and a light rail stop which forms the terminus of Manchester Metrolink's Altrincham line. The original heavy rail element of the station was opened by the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway as Altrincham and Bowdon railway station in April 1881, changing to Altrincham railway station in May 1974. The Metrolink element opened in June 1992. The Interchange underwent a complete redevelopment, at a cost of £19 million, starting in mid-July 2013. The new bus station opened officially on 7 December 2014. History A left left The station was opened on 3 April 1881 as Altrincham & Bowdon by the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway (MSJAR) to replace Altrincham (1st) railway station on Stockport Road and Bowdon station on Lloyd Street/Railway Street which both closed that day. All platforms were through, with Nos. 1 and 2 (nearest to the town) being used by the MSJAR. The Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC) trains from Manchester Central to Northwich and Chester Northgate used platforms 3 and 4. The CLC also operated a service from via to Altrincham, latterly using Sentinel steam railcars, but this service ceased in late 1939. The station became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway during the Grouping of 1923. The station then passed on to the London Midland Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. Since 6 May 1974, the station has been named Altrincham. In 1975 a new booking office was opened on platform 4 to serve the car park on the site of the former goods yard. Also in 1975 work, including the demolition of the glass covered canopy over the station entrance, began to convert the former station forecourt on Stamford New Road into a bus station which opened in November 1976. Thereafter the combined bus/rail station was referred to as Altrincham Interchange. When Sectorisation was introduced in the 1980s, the station was served by Regional Railways under arrangement with the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive until the privatisation of British Rail. Regional Railways electric trains between Manchester and Altrincham ceased serving the station on 24 December 1991. The former electric train platforms (1 and 2) reopened for use by Metrolink on 15 June 1992. A new roof for platform 1 costing £180,000 was installed in 2006. This platform had been uncovered since glazed panels were removed in 2003 due to safety concerns. The new roof is made of coated steel with clear panels to let in the light.\\"Station roof\\" , This is Trafford - Retrieved 28 November 2006 The station clock tower on Stamford New Road is a Grade II listed structure. =Redevelopment= The Interchange was redeveloped in 2013-15 by Laing O'Rourke. The project was partly funded by the Local Sustainable Transport Fund. The interchange reopened on 7 December 2014, integrating Bus, Rail and Metrolink services again, although the lifts and some roofing in the railway station was not completed until 2015. Facilities Altrincham Interchange has four platforms. Two bay platforms are used for Metrolink services. Two further through platforms accommodate train services on the line between and via .

He played ten seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Detroit Tigers, Brooklyn Dodgers, St. Louis Browns, Washington Senators, New York Yankees, and Cleveland Indians between 1938 and 1947. Cullenbine is particularly notable for his career-long ability to draw walks; he was among the American League leaders in walks for seven consecutive seasons from 1941 to 1947, and holds the major league record for most consecutive games (22) with a walk. Career Born in Nashville, Tennessee but raised in Detroit, Michigan, Cullenbine was a switch-hitter and one of the most prolific recipients of bases on balls in major league history. In his ten-year career, he collected almost as many walks (853) as he did hits (1,072). He was among the American League leaders in walks for seven consecutive seasons from 1941 to 1947. He was once walked four times in the same game by Yankee ace Lefty Gomez, in August 1941. In a July 1941 game, he scored 5 runs in only 2 official at bats. Driven largely by his ability to draw walks, he had a career on-base percentage of .408, 132 points higher than his career batting average of .276. This on-base percentage ranks 38th best in major league history, higher than many Hall of Fame legends, including Honus Wagner, Joe DiMaggio, Willie Mays and Hank Aaron. =Early years= He played football for Detroit's Eastern High School, and was a Tiger batboy in 1930. In 1932, legendary scout Wish Egan saw him working out on Navin Field and signed him. His minor league career ran from 1932 to 1937, for Shreveport, Louisiana; Greenwood, Mississippi; Springfield, Illinois; Beaumont, Texas; and Toledo, Ohio. After starting his major league career in 1938-39 for his hometown Detroit Tigers, he was among several major league players declared free agents in January 1940 by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis and was given a $25,000 bonus to sign with the Brooklyn Dodgers the following month. After playing only 22 games for the Dodgers, he was traded in May 1940 to the St. Louis Browns for Joe Gallagher. =Breakout season in 1941= He had a strong 1941 season for the Browns, hitting .317 with 121 walks for a .452 on-base percentage, 2nd only to Ted Williams in the AL. Cullenbine also drove in 98 runs, made the All-Star team (in Detroit, ending with a two-out ninth-inning come-from-behind walk-off three-run blast by Williams off Claude Passeau) and finished 10th in AL Most Valuable Player voting. =1942: Four teams and a World Series= After that career year with the Browns, he was bounced around to three different teams in 1942. He started the season with the Browns, but was traded to the Washington Senators on June 1. The New York Yankees then claimed him off waivers on August 31, 1942. This was a stroke of luck for Cullenbine, sending him to the 1942 World Series with a .300 on-base percentage and three runs scored for the Yanks, who were upset 4-1 by the overachieving St. Louis Cardinals. He was then traded on December 17, 1942 to the Cleveland Indians, his fourth team that calendar year. =1943 and 1944: An All-Star for the Cleveland Indians= He played for the Indians throughout 1943-44, putting up solid numbers both years: .289 & .284, with on-base percentages of .407 & .380. He made the All-Star team for a second time in 1944. =1945: A World Series Championship with the Tigers= Shortly after the start of the 1945 season, the Indians traded him back to his hometown Detroit Tigers where he had started his major league career. As was the case in 1942, he was fortunate enough to be traded in 1945 to a team that went on to win the American League pennant. In 1945, Cullenbine put up his best numbers in many offensive categories (with many stars still in World War II service). He led the American League with 113 walks, and was 2nd with a .402 on-base percentage. He also hit for power with 18 home runs (2nd), 93 runs batted ins (2nd), 51 extra base hits (4th) and a .444 slugging percentage (3rd). After leading the Tigers to the pennant, he helped the Tigers win the World Series over the Chicago Cubs. Despite hitting only .227 in the Series, he drew eight walks for a .433 on-base percentage and scored five runs. =1946 and 1947: Solid offensive production for Detroit= Cullenbine continued his solid offense for the Tigers in 1946 & 1947, with career-high .335 batting average and .477 on-base percentage in 1946. In 1947, he hit a career-high 24 home runs and set a Tiger record with 137 walks, while his .407 on-base percentage was third best in the American League. From July 2–22, 1947, he drew walks in 22 consecutive games, breaking Ted Williams' 19 in 1941 (as the last .400 hitter at .406), a record still standing at the end of the 2019 season. But with only 104 hits, his batting average dropped to .224 in 1947, and the Tigers released him after the season. =Retirement= Seeking to rebound from his release, he was picked up briefly by the Philadelphia Phillies only to be released again just three weeks into the 1948 season on April 19 without getting into a game despite his high lifetime on-base percentage, a statistic not regarded as highly in that era as it is today. =Career statistics= In 1,181 games played, Cullenbine batted .276 (1072 hits in 3879 at bats) with 627 runs scored, 209 doubles, 32 triples, 110 home runs, 599 runs batted in, an on-base percentage of .408 and a slugging percentage of .432 over 10 seasons. He finished his career with a .977 fielding percentage. In 12 World Series games, he hit .244 (10-41) with 8 runs and 6 runs batted in. Death Cullenbine died of heart disease at 77 in 1991 at Mount Clemens Hospital in Mount Clemens, Michigan, and was buried at the Christian Memorial Cultural Center Cemetery in Rochester Hills, Michigan.

It was built in 1907-10 by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;) on the same alignment as an 1886 B&O; bridge. Like its predecessor, it was the longest continuous bridge on the B&O; system.  History  =1866-1884: PW&B; Bridge= The 1866 completion of the nearby Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore (PW&B;) railroad bridge allowed trains between Baltimore and Philadelphia to cross the Susquehanna without the aid of a ferryboat for the first time. The B&O; used trackage rights on the PW&B; to operate trains to Philadelphia and Jersey City starting at about this time. In this way, the B&O; was able to expand its service territory with minimal capital expenditure. In 1869, the B&O; began advertising this route as the \\"New York and Washington Air Line Railway.\\" Although the PW&B; was an independent company at the time, the use of key sections of track in Philadelphia and New Jersey depended upon the cooperation of the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR). When the B&O;'s president John W. Garrett was outbid by the PRR for control of the PW&B; in early 1881, Garrett realized that B&O;'s Philadelphia and New York connections were in jeopardy. B&O; began planning immediately for its own line between Baltimore and Philadelphia, where a connection to the friendly Reading Railroad would provide access to the New York area. B&O; passenger trains continued crossing the river on the PW&B; until the trackage rights agreement expired on October 12, 1884. =1884-1907: First B&O; Bridge= B&O;'s new line, the Baltimore and Philadelphia Railroad, was built to higher engineering standards than typical on its system, despite the company's shaky finances. At the Susquehanna, the B&O; resolved to create a bridge that was superior to the PW&B; bridge it formerly used. As Garrett wrote in an 1884 report: > It...will be one of the largest and most remarkable structures of its class > in the world. It is the determination of the company that it shall be of the > most substantial, safe and durable character. It will be in length, above > low mean tide, and will rest on eleven granite piers, having their > foundations on the bed-rock of the river... The foundations for six of the > piers have been difficult, reaching, as they do, a depth of below low water, > and necessitating the use of caissons, with air chambers, in which the men, > engaged in removing the debris in order to reach bed-rock, have worked under > a pressure of . The bridge consisted of the following segments: a western approach viaduct, four Whipple deck truss spans, a through truss span over the western navigation channel, a deck truss span, a viaduct over Garrett Island, one and one Whipple deck truss spans, a through truss span over the eastern navigation channel, and finally a eastern approach viaduct. The eastern approach also crossed the PRR's Columbia and Port Deposit Railroad. Unlike the remainder of the Philadelphia line, the bridge contained only a single track.The lengths of the three spans on the eastern side of the river are surmised from the 1914 B&O; truss bridge report. The Baltimore Sun article of May 10, 1886, quoted by McCrain says the through truss section is 520 feet. The B&O; report assigns this length to one of the deck truss sections instead. The bridge cost $1.7 million to construct. It was opened with a ceremonial train on May 11, 1886. Freight operations began on May 25 of that year; passenger operations followed on August 23. The first Washington to New York train to use the new route crossed on December 15. Starting in 1890, passenger trains that used the bridge were marketed under the name Royal Blue Line. =1908-present: Second B&O; Bridge= In the early years of the 20th century, the iron bridges on the Philadelphia line could no longer handle the latest locomotive designs at optimal speeds. The Susquehanna Bridge also required an additional track. In November 1907, the American Bridge Company and Eyre-Shoemaker Company began renovating the structure. Timber falsework was used to shore up sections of the bridge under construction, allowing construction to proceed with minimal disruption to traffic. On September 23, 1908, a coal car derailed on the bridge and struck a mobile crane. The crane collapsed, bringing down the eastern channel through truss, which sank in deep water. One person was injured and 12 cars at the end of the train were lost. The PRR granted the B&O; the right to detour trains over its new double-track bridge, and so track connections between the B&O; and PRR were built at Swan Creek (west of Havre de Grace) and Aiken (near Perryville). At Aiken, the steep grade between the two lines required the use of helpers. This detour was maintained while the renovations to the Susquehanna Bridge were completed. Compared to the original bridge, the new bridge has shorter and more numerous deck truss spans. The superstructure is constructed of of steel and can support two tracks. Pennsylvania through truss spans are used over both navigation channels. 30 new piers were built; 10 were widened and remodeled. Three of the new piers were sunk in the west channel using the caisson process. The renovations cost more than $2 million. The new bridge opened for traffic on January 6, 1910. Passenger service east of Baltimore ended on April 26, 1958. By 1960, the entire Philadelphia line including the Susquehanna Bridge was single-tracked.

It consists of a Northern-operated heavy rail station on the Mid-Cheshire Line, and an adjoining light rail stop on the Altrincham Line of Greater Manchester's Metrolink network. The original heavy rail element of the station was opened by the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway in 1931, and the Metrolink element opened in 1992. A level crossing operates at the southern end of the station. History The station originally opened on 20 July 1931 on the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway (MSJAR) following the electrification of that line, and was referred to as Navigation Road (Altrincham) on early tickets, timetables, etc. British Rail electric trains between Manchester and Altrincham ceased serving the station on 24 December 1991. The former Altrincham-bound (down) platform has since been used for Mid-Cheshire Line trains and the former Manchester-bound (up) platform reopened as a Metrolink stop on 15 June 1992. Freight trains also operate through Navigation Road, including heavy block trains carrying limestone from quarries at Tunstead (near Buxton) to alkali works at Northwich. Facilities There is a car park on the Metrolink side of the station with 65 spaces plus 5 disabled spaces. In January 2018 a ticket machine was installed within the shelter on the heavy rail side of the station. Pre- ordered tickets can be collected here as well as buying tickets for journeys from this station. Services =Rail= Navigation Road is served by an hourly train service between Manchester Piccadilly and Chester via Stockport and Northwich, which is run by Northern Trains, with additional trains at peak times. The Sunday service originally ran only between Chester and Altrincham thus not serving Navigation Road, with passengers connecting onto the Metrolink at Altrincham for stations to Manchester, however a 2-hourly Sunday service to Manchester and beyond is now in place. =Metrolink= A T-68 tram leaves for Altrincham in 1992, shortly after the station's part conversion to Metrolink Navigation Road is located on the Altrincham Line with trams towards Altrincham stopping every 6 minutes during the day Monday to Saturday and every 12 minutes Monday to Saturday evenings and on Sundays. In the opposite direction, trams head towards Piccadilly and Bury, with the Monday to Saturday daytime service running every 12 minutes to both Piccadilly and Bury. Evening and Sunday journeys run to Piccadilly only. As of January 2019, Navigation Road is located in Metrolink fare zone 4.  Service pattern  *10 trams per hour to Altrincham (5 off-peak) *5 trams per hour to Bury (peak only) *5 trams per hour to Piccadilly. =Bus= Navigation Road station is served by Diamond Bus routes 285, which runs anti-clockwise, and 286, which runs clockwise, both running every hour. These routes run between Altrincham Interchange and Timperley, as a circular service.

He gained great popularity in Ethiopia in the 1970s and among the Ethiopian diaspora in the 1980s, before rising to international fame with African music fans in Europe and the Americas. Biography Born in Addis Ababa, Mercato district, Mahmoud was enthralled with the music he heard on Ethiopian radio from an early age. Having poorly learned in school, he worked shoeshiner before becoming a handyman at the Arizona Club, which was the after hours hangout of Emperor Haile Selassie I's Imperial Bodyguard Band. One night in 1962 when the band's singer didn't show up, Mahmoud asked to sing a few songs. He soon became part of the band's regular lineup, where he remained until 1974. After cutting his first single with Venus Band \\"Nafqot New Yegodagn\\" and \\"Yasdestal\\" in 1971, Mahmoud continued to record with several bands for the Amha and Kaifa record labels throughout the 1970s. The overthrow of Emperor Selassie and the suspension of musical nightlife under the military government created shifts in the Ethiopian music industry—the Imperial Body Guard Band were no more, and Mahmoud continued to make hit records and cassettes with many musicians who remained in the country, including the Dahlak Band, and the Ibex Band. He also began to release solo cassettes, accompanying himself on the krar, guitar or mandolin. Mahmoud Ahmed performing in Washington DC at the 2008 Ethiopian Soccer Tournament By 1978, censorship laws prevented Mahmoud from releasing his music on vinyl and so he switched to releasing cassettes. In the 1980s, Mahmoud operated his own music store in Addis Ababa's Piazza district while continuing his singing career. With many Ethiopian refugees living abroad, Mahmoud became one of the first modern Ethiopian music makers to perform in the United States on a 1980–1981 tour with the Walias Band, Getatchew Kassa, and Webeshet Fisseha. Mahmoud soon began releasing records with the Roha Band and became popular in diaspora communities. In 1986, Mahmoud's music reached a larger western audience when the Belgian label Crammed Discs released the collection Ere Mela Mela drawn from two Kaifa LPs Mahmoud had recorded in Addis with the Ibex Band a decade earlier. Ethiopia was making headlines in the west because of political repression and famine, and the contrasting tone of Mahmoud's first international release received much acclaim in the burgeoning world music community. Mahmoud gained even greater international popularity in the late 1990s after Buda Musique launched the Éthiopiques series on compact disc. This led to new recordings and tours in Europe and the United States with Boston's Either/Orchestra and Badume Band. Though he has made his home in Addis Ababa and works with a number of NGOs and philanthropic causes,http://www.tadias.com/11/29/2008/mahamud-ahmed-at-benefit-concert-to- build-ethiopian-church-in-san-diego/ he continues to tour internationally, performing concerts both for world music fans as well as the Ethiopian diaspora. In 2007, Mahmoud won a BBC World Music Award. While Ere Mela Mela made him a household name, Mahmoud is generally known for his Tizita, a genre that reminisce the past – slow and groovy style of music, Tew Lemed Gelaye with close to three million views on You Tube is one of his enduring Tizita music of the modern era.

Sometimes rubredoxins are classified as iron-sulfur proteins; however, in contrast to iron-sulfur proteins, rubredoxins do not contain inorganic sulfide. Like cytochromes, ferredoxins and Rieske proteins, rubredoxins participate in electron transfer in biological systems.  Structure  The 3-D structures of a number of rubredoxins have been solved. The fold belongs to the α+β class, with 2 α-helices and 2-3 β-strands. Rubredoxin active site contains an iron ion which is coordinated by the sulfurs of four conserved cysteine residues forming an almost regular tetrahedron. This is sometimes denoted as a [1Fe-0S] or an Fe1S0 system, in analogy to the nomenclature for iron-sulfur proteins. While the vast majority of rubredoxins are soluble, there exists a membrane-bound rubredoxin, referred to as rubredoxin A, in oxygenic photoautotrophs. Rubredoxins perform one-electron transfer processes. The central iron atom changes between the +2 and +3 oxidation states. In both oxidation states, the metal remains high spin, which helps to minimize structural changes. The reduction potential of a rubredoxin is typically in the range +50 mV to -50 mV. This iron-sulphur protein is an electron carrier, and it is easy to distinguish its metallic centre changes: the oxidized state is reddish (due to a ligand metal charge transfer), while the reduced state is colourless (because the electron transition has an energy of the infrared level, which is imperceptible to the human eye).

The electron transfer rate has three parameters it depends on electronic coupling, reorganization energy and free energy of reaction (ΔG°)  Protein mechanism and effects  The amide NH--S-Cys H-bonding lowers the inner sphere reorganization energy giving more rapid electron transfer and the Leu gate stabilizes the Fe 2+ reduced form shifts the redox potential to more positive E0 values. The protein mechanism for the electron transfer of rubredoxin occurs in two steps. The first protein effect, is through the expansion of iron-sulfur bond lengths upon reduction and the shortening of hydrogen bond lengths ensure a better electrostatic stabilization of the negative charge. The other protein effect, is gating mechanism which is created from the conformational changes of Leucine 41. The leucine 41 has a non-polar side chain that allows for transient penetration of the water molecules. This increases the polarity of the redox site environment. The Leucine 41 side chain has two different conformations; reduced and the oxidized form. The conformation in the reduced form is open and allows water molecules near the [Fe(S-Cys)4] 2+ active site and stabilizing the higher net positive charge of the reduced Fe 2+ oxidation state. This shifts the potential 50 mV more positive as indicated by Leucine 41 – Alanine site directed mutagenesis shift of the Fe 3+/2+ redox potential 50 mV more positive. The conformation allows for the infiltration of water molecules which lets the formation of the strongly Hydrogen-bond to attach.

Events  There are four events in the TMSCA at both the middle and high school level: Number Sense, General Mathematics, Calculator Applications, and General Science. Number Sense is an 80-question exam that students are given only 10 minutes to solve. Additionally, no scratch work or paper calculations are allowed. These questions range from simple calculations such as 99+98 to more complicated operations such as 1001×1938. Each calculation is able to be done with a certain trick or shortcut that makes the calculations easier. The high school exam includes calculus and other difficult topics in the questions also with the same rules applied as to the middle school version. It is well known that the grading for this event is particularly stringent as errors such as writing over a line or crossing out potential answers are considered as incorrect answers. General Mathematics is a 50-question exam that students are given only 40 minutes to solve. These problems are usually more challenging than questions on the Number Sense test, and the General Mathematics word problems take more thinking to figure out. Every problem correct is worth 5 points, and for every problem incorrect, 2 points are deducted. Tiebreakers are determined by the person that misses the first problem and by percent accuracy. Calculator Applications is an 80-question exam that students are given only 30 minutes to solve. This test requires practice on the calculator, knowledge of a few crucial formulas, and much speed and intensity. Memorizing formulas, tips, and tricks will not be enough. In this event, plenty of practice is necessary in order to master the locations of the keys and develop the speed necessary. All correct questions are worth 5 points and all incorrect questions or skipped questions that are before the last answered questions will lose 4 points; answers are to be given with three significant figures. Science is a 50-question exam that is solved in 40 minutes at the middle school level or a 60-question exam that is solved in a 2-hour time limit at the high school level. Tiebreakers are determined by the person that misses the first problem and by percent accuracy. As the name suggests, the test focuses on the science subjects learned in the middle school or high school level depending on the student's grade and the version of the test being taken.  Competitions  Individual schools that are members of TMSCA can host invitational competitions using TMSCA-released tests. Many schools use this as a fund- raising opportunity for their competitive math program. TMSCA also hosts two statewide competitions for member schools each year, one at the middle school level and one at the high school level, as well as a qualification competition at the middle school level prior to the state competition, also known as the Regional Qualifier. These statewide competitions are held at the University of Texas at San Antonio campus each spring. These competitions can often serve as practice for statewide UIL tournaments, which occur shortly after, and for middle school students are their only opportunity to compete at the state level (UIL competitions at the middle school level do not go beyond district). At the statewide competition, students have the opportunity to win scholarships based on their performance at the meet.  Grading  For the General Mathematics and General Science contests in middle school, 5 points are awarded for each correct answer and 2 points are deducted for each incorrect answer. In the high school contest, 6 points are awarded for each correct answer and 2 points are deducted for each incorrect answer. The real way to calculate the score is to multiply the number of questions you attempted by 5 and subtract 7 for each incorrect question. Unanswered questions do not affect the score. Thus, competitors are penalized for guessing incorrectly. (For both General Mathematics and General Science a perfect score is a 250.) On the Number Sense test, scoring is 5 times the last question answered (a student answering 32 questions would be awarded 160 points) and after that 9 points are deducted for incorrect answers, problems skipped up to the last attempted question and markovers/erasures, (so if the student above missed one and skipped three questions the student would end up with 124 points). Number sense tests are also checked for possible scratch work, overwrites, and erasures (bluntly called \\"markovers\\"), which if found could result in questions being counted as incorrect or tests being disqualified. (For both Number Sense and Calculator, a perfect score is a 400.) The Calculator Applications test multiplies 5 times the last question answered and deducts 9 points for incorrect or skipped questions, similar to Number Sense, but scratch work, markovers/erasures, and the use of a calculator is allowed.  Results  At almost all TMSCA competitions, students are ranked against each other in their specific grade level. For example, all eighth graders compete against each other, all seventh graders compete against each other, and so on and so forth. This ensures parity of competition since students in higher grades generally tend to score higher than students in the lower grades. Particularly at the high school level, there is a stark contrast between freshmen with little real math and science experience and seniors, who presumably have taken or are taking advanced placement science courses and calculus.

It was initially composed of five components: * QDD, or Quasar Data Dictionary: for building a central data dictionary used by all other components * QDesign: a character- based screen generator * Quick: an interactive, character-based screen processor (running screens generated by QDesign) * Quiz: a report writer * QTP: a batch transaction processor.  History  PowerHouse was introduced in 1982 and bundled together in a single product Quiz and Quick/QDesign, both of which had been previously available separately, with a new batch processor QTP. In 1983, Quasar changed its name to Cognos Corporation and began porting their application development tools to other platforms, notably Digital Equipment Corporation's VAX, Data General's Eclipse MV, and IBM's AS/400, along with the UNIX platforms from these vendors. Cognos also began extending their product line with add-ons to PowerHouse (for example, Architect) and end-user applications written in PowerHouse (for example, MultiView). Subsequent development of the product added support for platform-specific relational databases, such as HP's Allbase/SQL, DEC's Rdb, and Microsoft's SQL Server, as well as cross-platform relational databases such as Oracle, Sybase, and IBM's DB2. The PowerHouse language represented a considerable achievement. Compared with languages like COBOL, Pascal and PL/1, PowerHouse substantially cut the amount of labour required to produce useful applications on its chosen platforms. It achieved this through the use of a central data-dictionary, a compiled file that extended the attributes of data fields natively available in the DBMS with frequently used programming idioms such as: * display masks * help and message strings * range and pattern checks * help and information texts. In order to support the data dictionary, PowerHouse was tightly coupled to the underlying database management system and/or file system on each of the target platforms. In the case of the HP3000 this was the IMAGE shallow-network DBMS and KSAM indexed file system, and the entire PowerHouse language reflected its origins. Once described in the data dictionary, there was no further need to describe the attributes through any of the applications unless there was a need to change them on the fly, for example, to change the size of an item to make it fit within the constraints of a defined item. Simple QUICK screens could be generated in as few as four lines of source code: SCREEN FILE GENERATE GO was the name of the screen that the programmer assigned to the program. was the file name to be accessed in the data dictionary. Whether the items in the file would all fit in the screen would be determined by how many items and the size of them. If they didn't all fit, the program would have to be modified to eliminate unneeded items, change the size of items to some other size, etc. But, for a file with only a couple of items in it, it is quick and easy to generate a screen for data entry, deletion, or to simply look up data by an index. Simple QUIZ reports were almost as easy. A one-file report was as simple as: ACCESS REPORT ALL GO All items in the file would be sent to the screen, maybe not in the most desired fashion, but that simple. Since QTP programs usually involved adding, deleting, or modifying data, there was not much need for simple code programs. More care was exercised because of this potential danger, as a whole file (or files) of data could be wiped out rather easily. Any QUICK, QUIZ, or QTP programs could be run compiled (converted to machine language) or uncompiled (source code). Compiled programs generally ran faster, but there had to be a good method to modifications to the source code so as to not corrupt the object code. QUICK screens were used primarily for data entry, and could call other QUICK screens, QUIZ reports, or QTP applications to update data. Also, there were a few things that had to be done to the source code in order to generate compiled code. For example, the GO command to run the source code was equivalent to the BUILD command to generate the compiled code. Commands could be abbreviated to the first three characters when writing source code. ACCESS could be abbreviated to ACC, as well as DEFine, REPort, SCReen, etc. QUIZ reports could be routed to a printer, screen, or ASCII text files with the \`SET REPORT DEVICE \`command. Given the right access and commands, a novice could write simple report programs. Just as dangerous, though, the same novice could easily destroy the data as there was no security to whether one can call up any of the interpreters. If you had access to QUIZ, you also had access to QTP and QUICK. Like all virtual machine languages, PowerHouse is CPU intensive. This sometimes produced a visibly negative impact on overall transaction performance necessitating hardware upgrades. Cognos practice of tying license fees to hardware performance metrics resulted in high licensing costs for PowerHouse users.  Migration to the PC  Cognos initially attempted to move to the Intel platform in 1988 with the DOS-based PowerHouse PC. While the product was used by numerous partners to build bespoke applications for small to medium-sized customers it was not entirely unsuccessful at that time. However, Cognos eventually produced Axiant (c.1995), which ported PowerHouse- like syntax to an Intel-based Microsoft Windows visual development environment and linked it to SQL aware DBMS running on these machines. The radical changes wrought by the PC revolution, which began just at the time PowerHouse was introduced, eventually brought down the cost of host computers to such an extent that high-priced software development tools such as PowerHouse became unattractive to customers. PowerHouse in the 21st Century Around 1999 PowerHouse Web was released in order to support the development of web-aware applications. Products like Business Intelligence and Financial Performance Management that run on commodity architectures and high-end UNIX servers now form the core of the Cognos product line. Cognos was acquired by IBM on January 30, 2008. The PowerHouse Application Development Tools including PowerHouse server, Axiant 4GL and PowerHouse Web were acquired from IBM by UNICOM Systems, a division of UNICOM Global on December 31, 2013, and UNICOM continues to support the worldwide customer base for the products.

Brooks was drafted in the 14th round of the 1972 NFL Draft after playing college football at Virginia State University. He was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame in 2000. High school Virginia Sport Hall of Fame 2000 inductee,Virginia Sports Hall of Fame.com Larry Brooks, a native of Prince George and a Prince George High School standout, made a name for himself at every level of athletics. In high school, he was selected as an All-Central District choice as a defensive end. College career Brooks furthered his education and attended Virginia State University, where he was named to the Associated Press Little All-American team as a defensive tackle in 1971. He also was named Virginia Small College Lineman of the Year and received All-conference honors. Professional career Brooks became a starter at right defensive tackle in the 8th game of the season during his rookie year of 1972. He collected 9 quarterback sacks in 1973 and the Rams defense was tops in the NFL against the run (allowed 1270 rushing yards) and led the NFL in total defense (allowing just 2970 yards). Larry led Ram defensive linemen in tackles for the first time with 76. The 1973 Los Angeles Rams did not allow 300 yards in all 14 games in a 14-game season.NFL.com in 2008 the Steelers' defense has held opponents to under 300 yards in all 14 games this season, tied for the longest streak to start a season since 1970. However, the Steelers did not break the Rams' record.NFL.com \\"Week 15 nuggets\\". In 1974 Brooks tackled opposing passers 11 times as the Rams were first in the NFC with 44 sacks and again led the NFL in allowing the fewest rushing yards with 1302 while allowing the fewest points, 181. That season Brooks was All-NFC as selected by Pro Football Weekly, and Second-team All-Pro by Newspaper Enterprise Association. For the second season in a row, Brooks led all Ram defensive linemen in tackles with 73, not including his 11 sacks, which trailed only Jack Youngblood and Fred Dryer, the team leaders.1975 Los Angeles Rams Media Guide. He recorded 5 sacks in 1975 before a knee injury shelved him for the second half of the season. The Rams clearly missed him during the NFC Championship loss to Dallas as they were suckered countless times by the Cowboys shotgun in a 37-7 loss. The Rams defense was 2nd in the NFL in rushing defense missing out on leading the NFL for the third consecutive year by a single yard. The Minnesota Vikings allowed 1532 rushing yards, while the Rams allowed 1533, allowing the Vikings to capture that title. Nonetheless, the Rams allowed the fewest points in the NFL for the second straight season with 135 (missing the NFL record by 3 points).1976 Los Angeles Rams Media Guide. Brooks rebounded in 1976 was named to the Pro Bowl and was voted Second-team All-NFC by United Press International. His 74 tackles again led Ram defensive linemen, with 13 of those going for a loss, to go along with his 14½ sacks which tied him for the team lead with Jack Youngblood. The Rams led the NFC in rushing defense for the third time in the past four years. They were second only the Pittsburgh Steelers in the NFL in that category. In 1977 was named First-team All-Pro by the Pro Football Writers Association and The Sporting News and First-team All- NFC teams among several others. Rams allowed 146 points, 2nd best in the NFL. Brooks' 6½ sacks were 3rd on the team behind Jack Youngblood and Fred Dryer. His 71 tackles (55 solo) led all Rams defensive linemen (again) and returned to the Pro Bowl (again). Was voted the Rams Outstanding Defensive Lineman by the Los Angeles Rams Alumni. In 1978 Brooks was named Second-team All-Pro by the Associated Press and [Newspaper Enterprise Association and First-team All- NFC by United Press International and Pro Football Weekly despite missing the last 2 games of the season plus the NFC championship game with a knee injury. Led Rams in sacks with 8 as Rams were second in the NFC in sacks and led the NFL in total defense for the second time in the last six years. Brooks again led Rams defensive linemen in tackles with 80 (60 of them solo). Was voted to his third Pro Bowl, but missed the game as teammate Cody Jones (who was the first alternate) replaced him. In 1979, he led the Rams defensive line in tackles with 99 (9 behind the line of scrimmage) and had 6 sacks and knocked down 4 passes as Rams defense led the NFC in sacks with 52. Was named First- team All-Pro by the Associated Press. Ended season by playing in Super Bowl XIV with a torn up ankle as Rams lost to the world champion Pittsburgh Steelers. He also received another post season honor, that of Second-team All- NFC by United Press International. In 1980 Brooks led the defensive line in tackles with 54. His tackle number was lower than previous years as Rams began a rotation system at tackle with Brooks, Cody Jones (33 tackles-4 sacks), and Mike Fanning (37 tackles-10 sacks), who were all healthy for the first time since 1978. The 1980 season was the first since 1969 that three Ram defensive tackles amassed more than 30 tackles each. In addition to having 8½ sacks (as the Rams defense led the NFC with 56 sacks) Brooks was named to his fifth straight Pro Bowl was Second-team All-NFC by United Press International. That marked the sixth season in seven that Brooks attained post-season honors, in being either All-Pro, All-NFC, or a Pro Bowl selection. It also marked the seventh season in the last eight that Brooks led the Rams defensive linemen in tackles.1981 Los Angeles Rams Media Guide. The 1981 season was marred by injury as Brooks injured a knee at mid-season. The knee seemingly never fully recovered and Brooks played only two games at the end of the 1982 season. Coaching career Brooks retired after the 1982 season and from 1983-1990 was assistant defensive line coach for the Rams. He spent eight years with the team, where he was paired with defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur. He served as the defensive line coach for the Green Bay Packers from 1994–1998, the Seattle Seahawks from 1999-2002 both under Mike Holmgren, Then to the Chicago Bears in 2003, and was the Detroit Lions defensive line coach from 2004-05. He spent the 2006 season as the defensive line coach for the Arizona Cardinals marking his 21st season as an NFL assistant coach and 33rd season in the NFL as either a player or coach. In 1991 after his 20 years with the Rams (12 as a player, 8 as coach), Brooks returned to his alma mater, where he served as Virginia States’ Assistant Athletic Director and assistant football coach. He was ultimately named Athletic Director in 1993 before his return to the NFL in 1994. In 1998, he led the Packers to become the NFL’s fourth-ranked defensive unit that held its opponents to 281.7 yards a game, and a rushing defense that allowed just 90.1 rushing yards a game. He worked with former all-time sack leader Reggie White (198) and accepted the opportunity to groom one of the NFL’s top sack masters, Michael Sinclair. His line played a major role in Green Bay’s Super Bowl XXXI victory when the defense allowed a league low 259.8 yards per game and a meager 3.5-yard per rush average.

Description Gryponyx africanus is known from the holotype SAM 3357-59, a nearly complete postcranial skeleton which includes partial vertebral column, pelvis, both forelimbs and both hindlimbs. Gryponyx has been estimated to have been about in length. It was collected from the Upper Elliot Formation of the Stormberg Group (Karoo Basin), dating to the Hettangian to Sinemurian stages of the Lower Jurassic period. It was originally described by Broom (1911) as a theropod. Huene (1932) named the family Gryponychidae to contain Gryponyx and Aetonyx and placed it within Carnosauria.Friedrich von Huene (1932) Die fossile Reptil-Ordnung Saurischia, ihre Entwicklung und Geschichte.

University of California Press:Berkeley, 232-258. However, Vasconcelos and Yates (2004) found Gryponyx to be distinctive enough from other basal sauropodomorphs to be placed in its own genus. They found that it differs from other taxa by the following characteristics: total length of metacarpal I exceeds maximum proximal width and a long, narrow pubic apron with straight lateral margins. Although this publication wasn't formal, they conducted a cladistic analysis using Yates (2004) sauropodomorph matrix and found Gryponyx to be the most basal massospondylid.C. C. Vasconcelos, A. M. Yates (2004). Sauropodomorph biodiversity of the upper Elliot Formation (Lower Jurassic) of southern Africa. Geoscience Africa, Abstract Volume 2:670. The same result was found by Lü Junchang et al. (2010). Yates et al. (2010) recovered Gryponyx in a trichotomy with Massospondylidae and Anchisauria. However, Gryponyx has yet to be formally redescribed. Two additional species of Gryponyx have been described: G. transvaalensis was described on the basis of finger bones and the anterior limb metatarsals from the Late Triassic Bushveld Sandstone Formation, Transvaal. G. taylori was described on the basis of sacral and pelvic rim from the Upper Elliot Formation, southern Free State. Galton and Cluver (1976) synonymized G. taylori with M. harriesi and considered G. transvaalensis to be a nomen dubium. Both G. taylori and G. transvaalensis were synonymized by Michael Cooper (1981) with M. carinatus and Galton and Upchurch (2004) considered them to be dubious.

Description CNA Center is a simple, rectangular International Style building, but it is unique in that the entire building was painted bright red by Eagle Painting & Maintenance Company, Inc., turning an otherwise ordinary-looking structure into one of the most eye-catching buildings in the city. It was designed by the firm of Graham, Anderson, Probst & White and was completed in 1972. Occupants As of 2014, CNA occupied 65 percent of the tower. Other occupants included The Chicago Housing Authority and United Way. In December 2015, CNA announced it would sell the structure and relocate to a new facility at 151 North Franklin which would be renamed CNA Center. The company and developer, John Buck Co., expected the move to take place in summer 2018. As part of the transaction, Buck purchased the Wabash Street building for $108 million and would redevelop it. In August 2017, Buck and Northern Trust announced an agreement for the bank to lease of the building. The lease, which includes signage and naming rights, will consolidate approximately 2,500 to 3,000 Northern Trust workers from several sites around Chicago and take place in 2020.

The shorter red building was later restored to its original gray tone in 1999. The two buildings remain joined at the second floor: CNA's Conference Center uses space on that floor, but all entrance and egress to it is through CNA Center. The company's previous headquarters from 1943 to 1962 had been Metropolitan Tower (310 South Michigan Avenue, aka Continental Center I). In 1999, a large fragment of a window fell from the building and killed a woman walking with her child. Windows had been cracking at the building ever since it had been built in 1975.

One of the two Clydelink passenger ferries introduced in 2010 The second Clydelink passenger ferry introduced in 2010 The Renfrew Ferry is a passenger ferry service linking the north and south banks of the River Clyde in Scotland. The service, operated by Clydelink without subsidy, crosses between Renfrew and Yoker, close to Glasgow City Centre and is the last Clyde crossing this far upstream. History Originally the service operated from King's Inch, further upstream on land which is now the site of the Braehead Shopping Centre, but moved around two hundred years ago to better serve the town of Renfrew. In the 1960s there were many other crossings operating close to the Renfrew Ferry, mainly serving the dominant shipyards of the Clyde. The Erskine, Whiteinch, Partick, Govan and Finnieston ferries have all stopped providing the services as bridges and tunnels replaced them, but the Renfrew Ferry, being at a point where both tunnelling and bridging are difficult, has survived. It is the last operational Clyde crossing this far upstream, and the closest to Glasgow City Centre. The service was passenger-only until the car boom of the 1950s and 1960s, when it became a car ferry. With the opening of the Clyde Tunnel just two miles upstream, which allowed faster crossings, the car service ceased in May 1984. Now, due to expanding car use, the tunnel and surrounding routes are themselves frequently congested. One of the old car ferries can still be seen moored on the Broomielaw, in the city centre of Glasgow, where it is a popular entertainment and nightspot, also called the Renfrew Ferry. Yoker Swan Renfrew Rose mid-riverFrom 1984 until 2010 Strathclyde Partnership for Transport (SPT) operated two passenger-only boats, appropriately named the and Yoker Swan. In 2007, a study was started to see the feasibility of replacing the ferry with a bridge, which would allow 24-hour crossings. It would be necessary for the bridge to have a large clearance or be able to open, due to shipbuilding and other river navigation upstream on the River Clyde. The study found that a replacement bridge would cost around fifteen million pounds. The Strathclyde Partnership for Transport service ended at the end of March 2010, as part of moves to save £2.5m from their budget. The ferry was making an annual loss of £430,000 and SPT was providing a £3 subsidy for every £1.20 fare paid by passengers. Trials took place to ensure a seamless transition to a private sector service without subsidy. Five contenders included Scottish bus company Stagecoach Group, with an amphibious bus. and Inverness-based Clyde River Taxis. The successful company was Argyll-based Silvers Marine, operating as Clydelink, with a small, fast ferry. They inaugurated their service using a William E. Munson Company aluminium vessel, capable of carrying 12 passengers. The Renfrew Ferry figured prominently in the trial of Peter Manuel, with the ferryman as a key witness. Service The crossing, between the area of Yoker in Glasgow and the town of Renfrew in Renfrewshire, is only 200 metres, with graded slipways on each side. The service operates between 6.30 am and 9.30 pm, being on-demand at peak times and half-hourly at other times. The company plans to extend the service to Braehead. The service has had reliability issues, with two weeks out of service in 2017 and three weeks in 2018 as of late June. Transport links PS Waverley in 2009. The Renfrew Ferry was a dedicated bus terminus on the southern side. In recent years, the opening of Braehead Shopping Centre has seen most services divert via Ferry Village to Braehead Bus Station, and few services now stop at the ferry slipway, most stopping some 200m away. Services from FirstGroup and McGills are operated to Paisley, Govan, Renfrew, Glasgow, and Glasgow Airport. The northern side is located near Dumbarton Road, which is a major bus artery with numerous services. These are operated to destinations such as Helensburgh, Clydebank, Anniesland, Partick and Balloch. The large volume of onward transport available highlights that it serves a much larger area than just the immediate population around the ferry, and is an important public transport link in the west of the Greater Glasgow conurbation.

The Festival d'Avignon, or Avignon Festival, is an annual arts festival held in the French city of Avignon every summer in July in the courtyard of the Palais des Papes as well as in other locations of the city. Founded in 1947 by Jean Vilar, it is the oldest existent festival in France and one of the world's greatest. Alongside the official festival, the \\"In\\" one, a number of shows are presented in Avignon at the same time of the year and are known as the \\"Off\\". In 2008, some 950 shows were performed during three weeks.  The Birth of a Festival  = 1947, The Week of Scenic Arts = Art critic Christian Zervos and poet René Char organized a modern art exhibition held in the main chapel of the Pope's Palace in Avignon. In that setting, they asked Jean Vilar, actor, director, theater director, and future festival founder, to present Meurtre dans la cathédrale which he adapted in 1945. After refusing, Vilar proposed three plays: Shakespeare's Richard II, a play almost unknown in France at that time, La Terrasse de midi, by Maurice Clavel, then unknown author, and L'Histoire de Tobie et de Sara by Paul Claudel.« Histoire », Site of the festival d'Avignon The \\"In\\" Festival The festival is organised by a non-profit organisation (since 1980), which is administered by a board of trustees composed of: the French state, the city of Avignon, the Département of Vaucluse, the Région Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, and seven public figures competent in the field of theatre. Amongst other places, the \\"In\\" Festival is performed in the \\"Cour d'Honneur\\" – the honours courtyard – of the Palais des Papes, the place of residence of the Avignon papacy during most of the 14th century. The \\"Off\\" Festival The \\"Off\\" festival is also organised by a non-profit organisation composed mostly of theatre companies and is performed in theaters schools, streets and all places suitable for performing. History The Festival d'Avignon was founded by Jean Vilar in 1947. Jean Vilar was invited to present his first great successful play – Murder in the Cathedral by T. S. Eliot in the Palace of the Popes. At the same moment and at the same place, an exhibition of contemporary paintings and sculptures was organized by Christian Zervos, an art critic and collector, and by René Char, the poet. Vilar initially refused the invitation, as for him the Cour d'Honneur of the Pope's Palace was too vast and \\"shapeless\\" and he also lost the performance rights of the play. However, he proposed three creations: Shakespeare's Richard II, one of Bard's plays that was little known at the time in France; Paul Claudel's Tobie et Sara (Tobie and Sara), and Maurice Clavel's second play, La Terrasse de Midi (The Midday Terrace). The very first Festival d'Avignon in September 1947 set the scene as a showcase for unknown work and modern scripts. Upon obtaining initial success, the festival began enjoying the contribution of many young talents. Among the actors and actresses invited by Vilar, one finds the following: Jean Négroni, Germaine Montero, Alain Cuny, Michel Bouquet, Jean-Pierre Jorris, Silvia Montfort, Jeanne Moreau, Daniel Sorano, Maria Casarès, Philippe Noiret, Monique Chaumette, Jean Le Poulain, Charles Denner, Jean Deschamps, Georges Wilson, and Gérard Philipe. The festival's success grew, in spite of criticisms, which were at times virulent. Vilar's idea of a \\"popular theatre\\" moved critics to refer to Vilar as \\"Stalinist\\", \\"fascist\\", \\"populist\\", or \\"cosmopolitan\\". On the other hand, Vilar's conception of the theatre remained conservative with respect to competing conceptions developed especially in the course of the 1960s. On the crest of the wave of contemporary tendencies to revolutionize theatrical practices, in 1966 Avignon's Théâtre des Carmes, co- founded by André Benedetto and Bertrand Hurault, staged a festival « Off », unofficial and independent. The following year, Benedetto's theatre was joined by other kindred theatrical companies. In response to the \\"Off\\" challenge, in 1967 Jean Vilar gave rise to the festival of the \\"Court of Honor of the Popes' Palace\\" (la Cour d'honneur du Palais des papes). Thenceforth, numerous further sites will be chosen to stage the festival's theatrical representations. Vilar directed the festival until his death, in 1971. In that year, Vilar's \\"Inn\\" festival included thirty-eight shows. = 2020 edition and COVID-19 pandemic = It was announced on 13 April 2020 that the 2020 edition would be cancelled because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Strikes during the Festival Due to the anti-authoritarian protest movements of May 1968, the 22nd edition of the Festival of Avignon hosted virtually no French shows, halving the number of planned shows down from a total of 83. Relatively unaffected were the shows of the \\"Living Theatre\\", Maurice Béjart's representations at the Court of Honor, as well as various film viewings taking advantage of that same year's cancellation of the Festival of Cannes. Béjart's show of 19 July in the Court of Honor was disrupted by Saul Gottlieb, a viewer who entered the stage to order Béjart to halt his show. Towards the end of the show, the comedians of the \\"Théâtre du Chêne Noir,\\" from the \\"Off\\" festival, erupted on the scene, forcing Béjart's dancers to improvise around them. In 2003, a total of 750 shows were anticipated, prior to the festival's being cancelled for the year due to strikes by the show business's \\"casual workers\\" (\\"intermittents\\") protesting to reform indemnification laws. Approximately one hundred of the \\"Off\\" festival's shows were cancelled, as well. On 3 July 2014, the festival committee voted by a 224–110 margin (4 votes of abstention) in favor of a strike during the event in support of the recent claims of the intermittent workers about their unemployment insurance. Research archives Archives on the works of Jean Vilar and the totality of the 3,000 representations programmed by the Festival of Avignon since its 1947 debut are conserved at Maison Jean-Vilar, located in Avignon at 8, rue de Mons, Montée Paul-Puaux. The Maison houses most notably a library, videotheque, expositions and database. The Association Jean Vilar publishes the review journal, Les Cahiers Jean Vilar, which inscribes the thought of the festival's ideator in a resolutely contemporary context, analysing the place of theatre in society, as well as political stakes involved in theatrical production.

It is through the Born Rule that probability enters into the theory. In its simplest form, it states that the probability density of finding a particle at a given point is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the particle's wavefunction at that point. It was formulated by German physicist Max Born in 1926.  Details  The Born rule states that if an observable corresponding to a self-adjoint operator A with discrete spectrum is measured in a system with normalized wave function psirang (see Bra–ket notation), then * the measured result will be one of the eigenvalues lambda of A, and * the probability of measuring a given eigenvalue lambda_i will equal langpsiP_ipsirang, where P_i is the projection onto the eigenspace of A corresponding to lambda_i. :(In the case where the eigenspace of A corresponding to lambda_i is one-dimensional and spanned by the normalized eigenvector lambda_irang, P_i is equal to lambda_iranglanglambda_i, so the probability langpsiP_ipsirang is equal to langpsilambda_iranglanglambda_ipsirang. Since the complex number langlambda_ipsirang is known as the probability amplitude that the state vector psirang assigns to the eigenvector lambda_irang, it is common to describe the Born rule as saying that probability is equal to the amplitude-squared (really the amplitude times its own complex conjugate). Equivalently, the probability can be written as langlambda_ipsirang^2.) In the case where the spectrum of A is not wholly discrete, the spectral theorem proves the existence of a certain projection-valued measure Q, the spectral measure of A. In this case, * the probability that the result of the measurement lies in a measurable set M is given by langpsiQ(M)psirang. Given a wave function psi for a single structureless particle in position space, implies that the probability density function p(x,y,z) for a measurement of the position at time t_0 is :p(x,y,z)=psi(x,y,z,t_0)^2.  History  The Born rule was formulated by Born in a 1926 paper. In this paper, Born solves the Schrödinger equation for a scattering problem and, inspired by Einstein's work on the photoelectric effect, concludes, in a footnote, that the Born rule gives the only possible interpretation of the solution. In 1954, together with Walther Bothe, Born was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for this and other work. John von Neumann discussed the application of spectral theory to Born's rule in his 1932 book.  Interpretations  Within the Quantum Bayesianism interpretation of quantum theory, the Born rule is seen as an extension of the standard Law of Total Probability, which takes into account the Hilbert space dimension of the physical system involved. In the ambit of the so-called Hidden-Measurements Interpretation of quantum mechanics the Born rule can be derived by averaging over all possible measurement-interactions that can take place between the quantum entity and the measuring system. It has been claimed that Pilot wave theory can also statistically derive Born's law. While it has been claimed that Born's law can be derived from the many-worlds interpretation, the existing proofs have been criticized as circular. Kastner claims that the transactional interpretation is unique in giving a physical explanation for the Born rule.

In 1748, the Prussian king Frederick the Great had a water tank with a capacity of around built on top to supply the Sanssouci water features, and had it decorated with artificial ruins. From 1841 a surrounding landscape garden was laid out at the behest of King Frederick William IV of Prussia, according to plans designed by Peter Joseph Lenné. History The lands around the former Hünenberg hill had been part of the partridge and pheasant hunting grounds of Frederick's father King Frederick William I of Prussia. His son Frederick the Great began the erection of Sanssouci Palace in 1745. Frederick wanted a lot of water for his then planned projects: a fountain complex, the Neptune Grotto, and a marble colonnade in Sanssouci Park, which is no longer standing. The plans intended to draw water from the Havel with windmills into the high basin on the mountain. It then flowed under the park through a tubular system of hollowed tree trunks, which was to bring the water up into the fountains. Though the king poured a great deal of money into the project, it yielded no success because of the technical ignorance of his men. After many years of effort, Frederick’s dream of fountains was finally given up in 1780. In a letter to Voltaire, he wrote in 1778: > I wanted to have a water jet in my garden: Euler calculated the force of the > wheels necessary to raise the water to a reservoir, from where it should > fall back through channels, finally spurting out in Sans Souci. My mill was > carried out geometrically and could not raise a mouthful of water closer > than fifty paces to the reservoir. Vanity of vanities! Vanity of geometry! Master Builder Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff and Theater Painter Innocente Bellavite designed blinds of imitation antique ruins. A Monopteros (round temple), three high ionic columns, a small pyramid, and a ruined wall, designed as if from a Roman theatre, were grouped around the pool. The Pump House on the Havel Around a century after the construction of Sanssouci, Friedrich Wilhelm IV realized Frederick’s dream. Through new technical possibilities of the steam engine and a modern piping system, the fountains were put into place. A building was erected especially for the steam engine (August Borsig) and its pump machine from 1841 to 1843 on the shore of the Havel. Disguised as a mosque, it was designed by Ludwig Persius. Persius also had plans to extend the theater wall on the Ruinenberg with a high look-out tower, in imitation of a medieval watchtower. After his early death, the so- called Norman Tower was built by Ferdinand von Arnim in 1846. References *The information in this article is based on a translation of its German equivalent.

He is a member of the Wrecker's Wrecking Crew. Publication history Created by Len Wein and Sal Buscema, the character made his first appearance in The Defenders #17 (November 1974). Fictional character biography Brian Philip Calusky, though born in Brooklyn, NY, was raised on a farm and eventually becomes a farmhand. Life on the farm is too slow for Calusky and he decides to enter a life of crime for excitement. His criminal activities eventually land him in prison, where he meets and becomes cellmates with Dirk Garthwaite, who is known as the Wrecker. Garthwaite, together with Calusky and two other inmates at Ryker's Island Prison, Dr. Eliot Franklin and Henry Camp, make a successful jailbreak and manage to locate his crowbar. Willing to share his power with his allies, The Wrecker has the three other convicts join him in holding onto the crowbar outside during an electrical storm. Lightning strikes the crowbar, magically distributing the enchanted strength bestowed upon the Wrecker among the four of them. The Wrecker's three allies then adopt costumes and aliases as well: Franklin becomes Thunderball, Camp becomes Bulldozer, and Brian Philip Calusky becomes Piledriver. As a result of his newfound powers, Calusky's hands become oversized in proportion to his body. Together, the four superhumanly strong criminals become known as the Wrecking Crew, who are led by the Wrecker himself. They battle the Defenders while attempting to locate the gamma bomb; Piledriver is defeated by Power Man in this encounter.Defenders #17-19 With the Wrecking Crew, Piledriver next battled Captain America and Iron Fist while trying to lure Thor into battle.Iron Fist #11-12 The Wrecking Crew then did battle Thor in a revenge attempt.Thor #305 The Wrecking Crew were among the various criminals taken to the Beyonder's Battleworld, including a number of superpowered criminals and superheroes. Piledriver got the opportunity to face off against the Avengers, the Hulk, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four, and other superheroes.Marvel Super-Heroes Secret Wars #1-12 Piledriver stole computer discs from Dextron Labs and the Wrecking Crew next battled Spider-Man and Spider-Woman II.Spectacular Spider-Man #125 Along with the Wrecking Crew, Piledriver next joined the fourth Masters of Evil, which attacked and took over Avengers Mansion. Piledriver helped defeat the god Hercules in combat, but was drained of his superhuman powers by Thor.Avengers #273-277 He was freed from prison by the Wrecker, but without his superhuman powers he was defeated by Spider-Man and Spider- Woman.Spectacular Spider-Man #126 He regained his powers and escaped from the Vault. He defeated Captain America and encountered Damage Control personnel.Damage Control (vol. 2) #1 With the rest of the Wrecking Crew, Piledriver freed the Wrecker and Ulik from police custody and battled Hercules and Thor.Thor #418 They battled Thor, Excalibur, Code: Blue, and the Ghost Rider II. His powers were then again drained by Loki, but he escaped.Thor #426-428 Piledriver has the demeanor of a \\"good ol' country boy\\" (despite being born in the very urban Brooklyn, NY). He has fought many of Marvel's superheroes over the years, including Spider-Man, the Avengers, the Defenders, and most often, Thor. He, as part of the Wrecking Crew threatened the lives of the innocent civilians of Damage Control. Thunderball, who has a soft spot for the man in charge, John Porter, actually attacks Piledriver and the others via trickery, allowing the Damage Control employees to escape. Unlike Thunderball, Piledriver has remained loyal to the Wrecker and has only been separated from the Wrecking Crew through various incarcerations in prison. While Piledriver and the rest of the Wrecking Crew have faced defeat on many occasions, they always come back for more, making them one of the most enduring supervillain teams in Marvel's history. Piledriver discovers that he has a son named Ricky Calusky.Runaways The boy lived with his grandparents, but when he discovered who his father was, he ran away and joined the Wrecking Crew (to the pride of his father) under the name the Excavator. Ricky even gains a mystically charged shovel. However, he and the rest of the Crew were defeated by the Runaways during a bank robbery. The Hood has hired him as part of his criminal organization to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act. He helps them fight the New Avengers, but is taken down by Dr. Strange. As part of the Hood's gang, he later joins the fight against the Skrull invading force in New York.Secret Invasion #6 He joins with the Hood's gang in an attack on the New Avengers, who were expecting the Dark Avengers instead.New Avengers #50 During the Avengers: Standoff! storyline, Piledriver was an inmate of Pleasant Hill, a gated community established by S.H.I.E.L.D.Captain America: Sam Wilson #7 During the \\"Search for Tony Stark\\" story arc, Piledriver and the Wrecking Crew rejoin the Hood's gang as they attack Castle Doom. Piledriver is defeated by Doctor Doom in his Iron Man armor.Invincible Iron Man #597-598 Powers and abilities Thanks to Asgardian magic, Piledriver possesses superhuman strength and a high degree of imperviousness to harm. He can withstand high amounts of concussive force and is virtually bulletproof. Piledriver's power augmented his entire body, strengthening his bone, muscle and flesh. Because of this, he is capable of withstanding the impact of high caliber bullets. Because of his strength and particular talent, he has oversized hands which are more powerful than the other members of the Wrecking Crew, with the exception of the Wrecker himself. His superhuman abilities are currently four times greater than when he originally shared the Wrecker's power, making him somewhat stronger than an average well-trained Asgardian god.Damage Control (vol. 2) #1 Other versions =House of M: Masters of Evil= Piledriver (along with the rest of the Wrecking Crew) appears as a member of the Hood's Masters of Evil.House of M: Masters of Evil #1 He ends up absorbed into Scramble's body when the Masters of Evil arrive in the Central American country of Santo Rico.House of M: Masters of Evil #2 =Ultimate Marvel= In the Ultimate Marvel Universe, Piledriver, as a regular civilian, worked for the restoration company called Damage Control.

Formerly the Regency Hotel, the building is privately owned by local investor and proprietor V. Robert (Rob) Salazar, who bought the building in 2004, and serves three schools: Community College of Denver (CCD), Metropolitan State University of Denver (MSU Denver), and the University of Colorado Denver (CU Denver). Located at 3900 Elati Street, two miles from the Auraria Campus off Interstate 25 and Park Avenue West, The Regency is Auraria's first student housing community; the others are the Campus Village Apartments and the Inn at Auraria. History The Regency Hotel was built by real-estate developers Marvin and Victor Lederman, and designed by Richard DeGette, with construction starting in 1968. It was designed to serve as a regional convention center, with banquet and meeting rooms, exhibit areas for car dealers, four restaurants, three bars, a disco, an indoor and an outdoor swimming pool, and tennis courts, and was known for its large gold dome, the Piccadilly Rotunda. The convention center had an authorized capacity of 4,350. In the early and mid-1970s the hotel flourished; Elvis Presley stayed in the penthouse several times, and the hotel was said to keep a piano there for him. The hotel subsequently became neglected. Art Cormier, known in Denver for owning what he said was the world's largest laundromat, operated a popular nightclub called Los Caporales there from April 1998 and in May 1999 bought the property with the intention of renovating it. In February 2002 a fire that was determined to be arson damaged 60 rooms and seriously injured one person. In January 2003 Cormier announced his intention to sell the hotel at auction. In April 2003 the city closed some of the entertainment areas for safety violations, and in April 2004 a judge closed the entire hotel as unsafe, requiring those living there to leave by the end of the next day. Salazar's Regency Realty Investors LLC (now Central Street Capital) bought the hotel for $6.4 million in 2004, at which time it had 410 rooms. Architectural Workshop designed the conversion into student housing, for which they won the 2005 silver Colorado Hard Hat Award for renovation/restoration and an Honorable Mention for Renovation Design in the 2006 Colorado ASID Awards. There was a fire in the rotunda in June 2005. The Regency Student Housing Community opened in fall 2005 with 300 beds and added another 400 within a year. A new building with 360 beds in 120 units, The Villas at Regency, was added in 2012–13. The Regency is open to both undergraduates and graduate students of the Auraria Campus institutions and is administered by Auraria Student Housing at the Regency. In 2015 ASH won a lawsuit against Campus Village Apartments over the University of Colorado Denver's requirement that freshmen and new international students live at Campus Village, which is owned by a different private operator.

Huntington, Dina Bangdel, The Circle of Bliss: Buddhist Meditational Art, p. 524. Historically, the dharmachakra was often used as a decoration in Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist temples. Etymology Sanskrit: \\"Wheel of the Law.\\" The Sanskrit noun dharma is a derivation from the root dhṛ, which has a meaning of \\"to hold, maintain, keep\\", and takes a meaning of \\"what is established or firm\\" and hence \\"law\\". It is derived from the Vedic Sanskrit n-stem dharman- with the meaning \\"bearer, supporter\\" in the historical Vedic religion conceived of as an aspect of Ṛta. History and usage Similar wheel/chakra symbols are one of the most ancient in all Indian history. Madhavan and Parpola note that a wheel symbol appears frequently in Indus Valley civilization artifacts, particularly on several seals.The Ancient Indus Valley: New Perspectives By Jane McIntosh. p. 377 Notably, it is present in a sequence of ten signs on the Dholavira Signboard. As a solar symbol it first appears on clay seals of the Indus Valley Civilization from 2500 BCE. Such a wheel is also the main attribute of Vishnu. Indus characters from the northern gate of Dholavira, dubbed the Dholavira Signboard. Some historians associate the ancient chakra symbols with solar symbolism.Issitt, Micah. Main, Carlyn. (2014). Hidden Religion: The Greatest Mysteries and Symbols of the World's Religious Beliefs, ABC-CLIO, p. 185. In the Vedas, the god Surya is associated with the solar disc, which is said to be a chariot of one wheel (cakra). Mitra, a form of Surya, is described as \\"the eye of the world\\", and thus the sun is conceived of as an eye (cakṣu) which illuminates and perceives the world.T. B. Karunaratne (1969), The Buddhist Wheel Symbol, The Wheel Publication No. 137/138, Buddhist Publication Society, Kandy • Sri Lanka. Thus, a wheel symbol might also be associated with light and knowledge. =Buddhist usage and significance= Worshipers and Dharmachakra, Sanchi Stupa, South Face, West Pillar. In Buddhism, the Dharma Chakra is widely used to represent the Buddha's Dharma (Buddha's teaching and the universal moral order), Gautama Buddha himself and the walking of the path to enlightenment, since the time of Early Buddhism. The symbol is also sometimes connected to the Four Noble Truths, the Noble Eightfold Path and Dependent Origination. The pre-Buddhist dharmachakra (Pali: dhammacakka) is considered one of the ashtamangala (auspicious signs) in Hinduism and Buddhism and often used as a symbol of both faiths. It is one of the oldest known Indian symbols found in Indian art, appearing with the first surviving post-Indus Valley Civilization Indian iconography in the time of the Buddhist king Ashoka. The Buddha is said to have set the \\"wheel of dharma\\" in motion when he delivered his first sermon, which is described in the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta. This \\"turning of the wheel\\" signifies a great and revolutionary change with universal consequences, brought about by an exceptional human being. Buddhism adopted the wheel as a symbol from the Indian mythical idea of the ideal king, called a chakravartin (\\"wheel-turner\\", or \\"universal monarch\\"),, who was said to possess several mythical objects, including the ratana cakka (the ideal wheel). The Mahā Sudassana Sutta of the Digha Nikaya describes this wheel as having a nave (nābhi), thousand spokes (sahassārāni) and a felly (nemi), all of which are perfect in every respect. Siddhartha Gautama was said to have been a \\"mahapurisa\\" (great man) who could have chosen to become a wheel turning king, but instead became the spiritual counterpart to such a king, a wheel turning sage, i.e. a Buddha.Ludowyk, E.F.C. (2013) The Footprint of the Buddha, Routledge, p. 22. In his explanation of the term \\"turning the wheel of Dharma\\", the Theravada exegete Buddhaghosa explains that this \\"wheel\\" which the Buddha turned is primarily to be understood as wisdom, knowledge, and insight (ñāṇa). This wisdom has two aspects, paṭivedha-ñāṇa, the wisdom of self-realisation of the Truth and desanā-ñāṇa, the wisdom of proclamation of the Truth. The dharmachakra symbol also points to the central Indian idea of \\"Dharma\\", a complex and multivalent term which refers to the eternal cosmic law, universal moral order and in Buddhism, the very teaching and path expounded by the Buddha.Issitt, Micah. Main, Carlyn. (2014). Hidden Religion: The Greatest Mysteries and Symbols of the World's Religious Beliefs, ABC-CLIO, p. 186. The original Lion Capital of Ashoka, from Sarnath. In the Buddhist Art at early sites such as Bharhut and Sanchi, the dharmachakra was often used as a symbol of Gautama Buddha himself. The symbol is often paired with the triratna (triple jewel) or trishula (trident) symbolizing the triple gem, umbrellas (chatra), symbols of sovereignty and royal power, gems and garlands. It is also sometimes depicted alongside animals such as lions, or deer. There are different designs of the Buddhist dharmachakra with 8, 12, 24 or more spokes. In different Buddhist traditions, the different number of spokes may represent different aspects of the Buddha's Dharma (teaching). In the Indo- Tibetan Buddhist tradition for example, the 8 spoked wheel represents the noble eightfold path, and the hub, rim and spokes are also said to represent the three trainings (sila, prajña and samadhi).A Lamp Illuminating the Path to Liberation: An Explanation of Essential Topics for Dharma Students by Khenpo Gyaltsen (translated by Lhasey Lotsawa Translations, Nepal: 2014, pp. 247–248). In Buddhism, the cyclical movement of a wheel is also used to symbolize the cyclical nature of life in the world (also referred to as the \\"wheel of samsara\\", samsara-chakra or the \\"wheel of becoming\\", bhava-cakra). This wheel of suffering can be reversed or \\"turned\\" through the practice of the Buddhist path. The Buddhist terms for \\"suffering\\" (dukkha) and happiness (sukha) may also originally be related to the proper or improper fitting of wheels on a chariot's axle.Sargeant, Winthrop (2009), The Bhagavad Gita, SUNY Press, p. 303. The Indo-Tibetan tradition has developed elaborate depictions called Bhavacakras which depict the many realms of rebirth in Buddhist cosmology. The spokes of a wheel are also often used as symbols of the Buddhist doctrine of dependent origination. According to the Theravada scholar Buddhaghosa: > “It is the beginningless round of rebirths that is called the ’Wheel of the > round of rebirths’ (saṃsāracakka). Ignorance (avijjā) is its hub (or nave) > because it is its root. Ageing-and-death (jarā-maraṇa) is its rim (or felly) > because it terminates it. The remaining ten links [of Dependent Origination] > are its spokes [i.e. saṅkhāra up to the process of becoming, bhava].” The earliest Indian monument featuring dharmachakras are the Ashokan Pillars, such as the lion pillar at Sanchi, built at the behest of the Mauryan emperor Ashoka. According to Benjamin Rowland: > ”The Sārnāth column may be interpreted, therefore, not only as a > glorification of the Buddha’s preaching symbolised by the crowning wheel, > but also through the cosmological implications of the whole pillar as a > symbol of the universal extension of the power of the Buddha’s Law as > typified by the sun that dominates all space and all time, and > simultaneously an emblem of the universal extension of Mauryan imperialism > through the Dharma. The whole structure is then a translation of age-old > Indian and Asiatic cosmology into artistic terms of essentially foreign > origin and dedicated, like all Asoka’s monuments, to the glory of Buddhism > and the royal house.” According to Harrison, the symbolism of \\"the wheel of the law\\" and the order of Nature is also visible in the Tibetan prayer wheels. The moving wheels symbolize the movement of cosmic order (ṛta). =Jain, Hindu and modern Indian usages= Wheel of the chariot of the sun, Konark Sun Temple. State Emblem of India feature the 24 spoke Dharmachakra from the Lion Capital of Ashoka Jain illustration with dharmachakra and the motto Ahiṃsā Paramo Dharma (non- violence is the highest dharma). *The dharmachakra is a symbol in the sramana religion of Jainism, sometimes on statues of the Tirthankaras.Framing the Jina: Narratives of Icons and Idols in Jain History, p. 314, by John Cort, Oxford UniversityAsha Kalia, Art of Osian Temples: Socio-economic and Religious Life in India, 8th–12th Centuries A.D. Abhinav Publications, 1982, chapter 16.Sharma, Savita (1990). Early Indian Symbols: Numismatic Evidence, Agam Kala Prakashan, 1990 p. 51. The idea of a great king being associated with turning the \\"Wheel of Dharma\\" is something which is shared by Buddhism and Hinduism. In the Vishnu Purana and Bhagavata Purana, two kings named Jadabharata of the Hindu solar and lunar dynasties respectively are referred to as \\"chakravartins\\" (wheel turning kings). Wheel symbolism was widely used in Indian Temples, especially in temples to Surya, the sun god, the most famous of which is the Konark Sun Temple. In the Bhagavad Gita, verses 14, 15 and 16, of Chapter 3 speaks about the revolving wheel thus: > \\"From food, the beings are born; from rain, food is produced; rain proceeds > from sacrifice (yagnya); yagnya arises out of action; know that from Brahma, > action proceeds; Brahma is born of Brahman, the eternal Paramatman. The one > who does not follow the wheel thus revolving, leads a sinful, vain life, > rejoicing in the senses.\\" The 24 spoke Ashoka dharmachakra is present in the modern flag of India, representing the pan-Indian and Hindu concept of Dharma. The modern State Emblem of India is a depiction of the Lion Capital of Ashoka (Sanchi), which includes the dharmachakra. An integral part of the emblem is the motto inscribed in Devanagari script: Satyameva Jayate (). This is a quote from the Mundaka Upanishad, the concluding part of the Vedas. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, first Vice President of India has stated that the Ashoka Chakra of India represents the \\"wheel of the law of dharma\\", as well as \\"Truth or satya\\", \\"Virtue\\" as well as \\"motion\\", as in the \\"dynamism of a peaceful change\\". =Other uses and similar symbols= *The main attribute of the Indian god Vishnu is a wheel like weapon called the . *Similar wheel symbols were used as a solar symbol by the Ancient Egyptians. *Some Buddha statues also depict the related Dharmachakra Mudrā, a hand sign depicting the turning of the Dharma wheel. * A very similar wheel symbol also appears in the flag of the Romani people, hinting to their nomadic history and their Indian origins. * In non- Buddhist cultural contexts, an eight-spoked wheel resembles a traditional ship's wheel. As a nautical emblem, this image is a common sailor tattoo, which may be misidentified as a dharmachakra or vice versa. * In the Unicode computer standard, the dharmachakra is called the \\"Wheel of Dharma\\" and found in the eight-spoked form. It is represented as U+2638 (☸). As emoji: ☸️.

The species shares mainland Australia with three other members of the genus Pteropus: the little red P. scapulatus, spectacled P. conspicillatus, and the black P. alecto. The grey-headed flying fox is endemic to the south-eastern forested areas of Australia, principally east of the Great Dividing Range. Its range extends approximately from Bundaberg in Queensland to Geelong in Victoria, with outlying colonies in Ingham and Finch Hatton in the north, and in Adelaide in the south. In the southern parts of its range it occupies more extreme latitudes than any other Pteropus species. As of 2008 the species is listed as \\"Vulnerable\\" on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.  Taxonomy  A description of the species was published by Coenraad Temminck in his 1825 monograph of mammals. Hybridisation with the species Pteropus alecto has been noted where their ranges intersect. The common names for Pteropus poliocephalus include grey-headed kalong. The entry in Gould's Mammals of Australia (1863) gave the bat the title grey-headed vampire. Description Grey-headed flying-fox shows wingspan The grey-headed flying fox is the largest bat in Australia. The overall colour of the pelage is a dark-grey body with a light-grey head, separated by a reddish-brown collar. The fur on the body is long and streaked with grey, the broad and well defined collar completely encircles the neck with hair that is golden orange in tone. A unique characteristic among bats of the genus Pteropus is fur on the legs that extends all the way to the ankle. Adults may have a wingspan reaching one metre in length and be up to one kilogram in weight. Weight generally varies between 600 and 1000 grams, with an average of 700 g. The combined length of the head and body is from 230 to 290 mm. The forearm length is a range from 138 to 180 mm. The length of the ear from the tip to base is 30 to 37 mm. Like many megachiropterans, the species lacks a tail. All of these bats possess claws on its first and second digits. The head is simple in form, with the characteristic 'dog-like' appearance of the genus. Since it does not echolocate, it lacks the tragus or leaf ornamentation found in many species of Microchiroptera. It relies on smell and, predominately, sight to locate its food (nectar, pollen and native fruits) and thus has relatively large eyes for a bat. The voice of P. poliocephalus consists of a complex series of squeals and screechings. They will flap their wings in hot weather, using blood pumped through the patagium to cool the body temperature. The grey-headed flying fox is long-lived for a mammal of its size. Individuals reportedly survived in captivity for up to 23 years, and a maximum age of up to 15 years seems possible in the wild. Ecology = Distribution = The distribution range is at the eastern regions of the Australian continent, mostly within 200 kilometres of the coast, from Gladstone in Queensland through to the southern Gippsland region and populations around the city of Melbourne. The breeding range has been recorded as progressing southward, the temperate climate of Melbourne and Geelong and no further north than Maryborough, Queensland. Urbanisation may displace the species, or provide habitat that accommodates their feeding or roosting preferences. The city of Brisbane has many roosts occupied by the species; a famous colony at the Indooroopilly Island is noted for the evening departure of the bats across the local river. Within the central business district of Sydney, they can be seen travelling along city streets to feed at Moreton Bay fig trees at Hyde Park. The species was recorded as an occasional visitor to the national capital Canberra, although the flowering eucalypts at Commonwealth Park have seen more permanent camps established close to the city. The species was surveyed during the 1920s by Francis Ratcliffe, who recorded the populations in estimates of quarter, half, or one million in camps, generally located around 40 kilometres apart. These numbers have greatly declined since this first survey. =Habitat and movements= Grey-headed flying fox colony Grey-headed flying foxes live in a variety of habitats, including rainforests, woodlands, and swamps. These camps are variable in size and are seasonally relocated; the warmer parts of the year find them occupying cool and wet gullies in large groups. During the day, individuals reside in large roosts (colonies or 'camps') consisting of hundreds to tens of thousands of individuals. Colonies are formed in seemingly arbitrary locations. Roost vegetation includes rainforest patches, stands of melaleuca, mangroves, and riparian vegetation, but roosts also occupy highly modified vegetation in urban areas. A prominent example existed for many years at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney. However, the botanic gardens instituted a controversial policy to remove them from the garden grounds. The camp is now dispersed across Queensland. Movements of grey-headed flying foxes are influenced by the availability of food. Their population is very fluid, as they move in response to the irregular blossoming of certain plant species. They are keystone pollinators and seed dispersers of over 100 species of native trees and plants.\\"L Pope 2014\\" / Some Touch of Pity, pub=sid harta The grey-headed flying fox is a partial migrant that uses winds to facilitate long-distance movement. It does not migrate in a constant direction, but rather in the direction that will be the most beneficial at the time. Although recorded in small numbers sporadically throughout the 20th century, it was not until the 1980s that grey-headed flying foxes routinely visited Melbourne, with a permanent camp since the 1990s. Their residence at the Melbourne Botanic Garden was the subject of controversy, and the bats were eventually discouraged and moved to Yarra Bend at the city's river. The camp at this site was decimated during a heat wave, requiring its rehabilitation to sustain the relocated population. The forced relocations are also said to have led to the discovery of the orchards of the Goulburn Valley. Similarly, the first recorded permanent camp in Adelaide was established in 2010. The spread is likely due to global warming, habitat loss and drought; while the location of the new camps appears to be in response to urbanisation: a reliable food supply (such as native eucalypt plantings and backyard fruit trees) and warmer temperatures due to climate change and urban heat islands. =Diet and foraging= Feeding on plant nectar. Around dusk, grey-headed flying foxes leave the roost and travel up to 50 km a night to feed on pollen, nectar and fruit. The species consumes fruit flowers and pollens of around 187 plant species. These include eucalypt, particularly Corymbia gummifera, Eucalyptus muelleriana, E. globoidea and E. botryoides, and fruits from a wide range of rainforest trees, including members of the genus Ficus. These bats are considered sequential specialists, since they feed on a variety of foods. Grey-headed flying foxes, along with the three other Australian flying fox species, fulfill a very important ecological role by dispersing the pollen and seeds of a wide range of native Australian plants. The grey-headed flying fox is the only mammalian nectarivore and frugivore to occupy substantial areas of subtropical rainforests, so is of key importance to those forests. The teeth, tongue and palate of the pteropodid bats are able to extract plant juices from food, only swallowing smaller seeds of the meal. Incisors hold items such as fruit, and the fibrous material is ejected from the mouth after it is masticated and the juice is swallowed; larger seeds may be held in the mouth and dispersed several kilometres from the tree. The need for the elaborate intestinal tract of most herbivores is consequently removed. Some fruiting plants produce food for flying-foxes, and P. poliocephalus is attracted to the scent of their flowers and fruit and is able to locate the pale colour that indicates the source; the fruit and blooms of species that attract birds in the daylight are usually contrasting reds and purples. The food source is also presented away from the foliage that may obstruct the bat's access. Most of the trees on which this species forages produce nectar and pollen seasonally and are abundant unpredictably, so the flying fox's migration traits cope with this. The time when flying foxes leave their roosts to feed depends on foraging light and predation risk. Flying foxes have more time and light when foraging if they leave their roosts early in the day. The entire colony may leave later if a predatory bird is present, while lactating females leave earlier. With males, the bachelors leave earlier than harem-holding males, which guard and wait until all their females have left. The flying foxes that leave the roost earlier are more vulnerable to predation, and some flying foxes will wait for others to leave, a phenomenon labelled the \\"after you\\" effect. =Social organisation= Groupings and territories Grey- headed flying foxes form two different roosting camps, summer camps and winter camps. Summer camps are used from September to April or June. In these camps, they establish territories, mate, and reproduce. Winter camps are used from April to September. The sexes are separated in winter camps and most behaviour is characterised by mutual grooming. Summer camps are considered \\"main camps\\", while winter camps are referred to as \\"transit camps\\". In their summer camps, starting in January, male grey-headed flying foxes set up mating territories. Mating territories are generally 3.5 body lengths along branches.Welbergen, J.A. (2005) \\"The social organisation of the grey-headed flying-fox\\". PhD thesis, University of Cambridge, Cambridge. These flying foxes' neck glands enlarge in males in the mating season, and are used to mark the territories. The males fight to maintain their territories, and this is associated with a steep drop in the males' body condition during this time. Around the beginning of the mating season, adult females move from the periphery towards the central male territories where they become part of short-term 'harems' that consist of a male and an unstable group of up to five females. Centrally located males are polygamous, while males on the periphery are monogamous or single. The mating system of the grey-headed flying fox is best described as a lek because males do not provide any essential resources to females and are chosen on the basis of their physical location within the roost, which correlates with male quality.  Reproduction  Matings are generally observed between March and May, but the most likely time of conception is April.Martin, L., Kennedy, J.H., Little, L., & Luckhoff, H.C. (1993) \\"The reproductive biology of Australian flying-foxes (genus Pteropus)\\". In Ecology, evolution and behaviour of bats (ed S.M. Swift), pp. 167–186. Oxford, London. Most mating takes place in the territories and during the day. Females have control over the copulation process, and males may have to keep mating with the same females.Welbergen, J.A. (2002). \\"Second year report: The social organisation of the Grey-Headed Flying-Fox, Pteropus poliocephalus: causes, consequences, and conservation.\\" The Department of Zoology, The University of Cambridge, Cambridge. Females usually give birth to one young each year. Gestation lasts around 27 weeks, and pregnant females give birth between late September and November. Late births into January are sometimes observed. The altricial newborns rely on their mothers for warmth. For their first three weeks, young cling to their mothers when they go foraging. After this, the young remain in the roosts. By January, young are capable of sustained flight, and by February, March or April are fully weaned. =Predation= Flying foxes are preyed on by eagles, goannas and snakes. The camps of P. poliocephalus attract a number of larger predators. including both terrestrial and aerial hunters. The sea eagle Haliaeetus leucogaster will capture these bats in flight as they leave their roosts. The snake species Morelia spilota is frequently found as a resident at these camps, lazily selecting an individual from the apparently unconcerned group at a branch. The bat is seized in the jaws and encircled by the python's body, then swallowed head first to be digested over the next week. The species was reported by John Gould as being eaten by the indigenous Australians. Conservation A grey-headed flying fox electrocuted between electricity transmission lines in suburban Sydney The grey-headed flying fox is now a prominent federal conservation problem in Australia. Early in the last century, the species was considered abundant, with numbers estimated in the many millions. In recent years, though, evidence has been accumulating that the species is in serious decline. An estimate for the species in 2019 put the number at 586,000 and the national population may have declined by over 30% between 1989 and 1999 alone.Richards, G. (2000). In Proceedings of a workshop to assess the status of the Grey-headed Flying-Fox (eds G. Richards & L. Hall). Australasian Bat Society, Canberra. =Threats= Grey-headed flying foxes are exposed to several threats, including loss of foraging and roosting habitat,Eby, P. (1995). \\"The biology and management of flying-foxes\\" in NSW. Rep. No. 18. N.S.W. National Parks and Wildlife Service, Hurstville. competition with the black flying fox, and mass die-offs caused by extreme temperature events. When present in urban environments, grey-headed flying foxes are sometimes perceived as a nuisance. Cultivated orchard fruits are also taken, but apparently only at times when other food items are scarce. Because their roosting and foraging habits bring the species into conflict with humans, they suffer from direct killing of animals in orchards and harassment and destruction of roosts. Negative public perception of the species has intensified with the discovery of three recently emerged zoonotic viruses that are potentially fatal to humans: Hendra virus, Australian bat lyssavirus and Menangle virus. However, only Australian bat lyssavirus is known from two isolated cases to be directly transmissible from bats to humans. No person has ever died from ABLV (Lyssavirus) after having had the ABLV post-exposure vaccine. The urbanised camps of cities were noted as succumbing to poisoning during the 1970s to 1980s, identified as the lead in petrol that would accumulate on the fur and enter the body when grooming. The mortality rate from toxic levels of lead in the environment dropped with the introduction of unleaded fuel in 1985. An introduced plant, the cocos palm Syagrus romanzoffiana, now banned by some local councils, bears fruit that is toxic to this species and has resulted in their death; the chinese elm Ulmus parvifolia and privet present this same hazard. The species is vulnerable to diseases that may kill large numbers within a camp, and the sudden incidence of premature births in colonies is likely to significantly impact the re- population of the group; the cause of these disorders or diseases in unknown. Unsuitable backyard fruit tree netting also kills many animals and may bring them into close contact with humans, but can be avoided by using wildlife-safe netting. Barbed wire accounts for many casualties; this can be ameliorated by removing old or unnecessary barbed wire or marking it with bright paint. A male grey-headed flying fox, suffering from heat stress during a heatwave in New South Wales Recent research has shown, since 1994, more than 24,500 grey- headed flying foxes have died from extreme heat events alone. To answer some of the growing threats, roost sites have been legally protected since 1986 in New South Wales and since 1994 in Queensland. In 1999, the species was classified as \\"Vulnerable to extinction\\" in The Action Plan for Australian Bats, and has since been protected across its range under Australian federal law. the species is listed as \\"Vulnerable\\" on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The early twentieth century saw the incursion of Pteropus poliocephalus to the opportunities they discovered at orchards, and the government placed a bounty on the declared pest. Their reputation for destroying fruit crops was noted by John Gould in 1863, though the extent of actual damage was often greatly exaggerated. When Ratcliffe submitted his report, he noted the number of paid bounties was 300,000, and this would not have included the mortally wounded escapees or those left suspended at roosts by the grip that is held by their weight. This species continued to be killed or wounded by shotguns, many remaining disabled where they fell after the bounty was stopped, despite the advice of Ratcliffe and later researchers on an ineffective and uneconomical practice and the needless extermination of the population. Orchardists have begun shifting to the use of netting that also discourages the daytime visits of birds. The impact of indiscriminate shooting of bats has resulted in the species being declared vulnerable to extinction, to the tree species that relied on them for regeneration, the subsequent alteration to the forest ecology of the eastern states =Wildlife rescue= Crib full of abandoned babies rescued by Wildcare Australia in care at The Bat Hospital Bat caregivers are not only specially trained in techniques to rescue and rehabilitate bats, but they are also vaccinated against rabies. Although the chance of contracting the rabies-like Australian bat lyssavirus is extremely small, bat caregivers are inoculated for their own protection. Flying foxes often come to the attention of Australian wildlife care and rescue organisations, such as Wildcare Australia, ONARR, Wildlife Carers Darling Downs, Bat Care, Bat Rescue, F.A.W.N.A. (NSW) Inc., Wildlife ARC, Northern Rivers Wildlife Carers, Northern Tablelands Wildlife Carers, Hunter Wildlife Rescue, Wildlife Aid, Tweed Valley Wildlife Carers, Wildlife Rescue South Coast, WIRES, and Wildlife Victoria when reported as injured, sick, orphaned, or abandoned. A very high proportion of adult flying fox injuries are caused by entanglement in barbed wire fences or backyard fruit tree netting, both of which can result in very serious injuries and a slow, agonising death for the animal if not rescued quickly. More recently wildlife advocacy groups such the Victorian Advocates for Animals has used the commercial development of a range of wildlife safe fruit tree netting products to push for regulations to make it illegal to install wildlife unsafe nets on backyard fruit trees. These new products have as their chief characteristic small apertures / holes of 5mm x 5mm or less. Flying foxes are able to climb across the netting without being entangled. It is hoped the uptake of wildlife safe netting products will see a marked decline in flying fox entanglements across time and subsequent reduction in public risk and the burden on wildlife rescue and rehabilitation volunteers. An emerging key threatening process to threatened flying-fox populations is the increasing numbers of days when temperatures exceed 41 °C, causing mass mortalities in flying-fox camps throughout their range along Australia's eastern seaboard. Baby flying foxes usually come into care after having been separated from their mothers. Babies are often orphaned during four to six weeks of age, when they inadvertently fall off their mothers during flight, often due to disease or tick paralysis (their own and/or that of the mother). When they are older, orphans usually come into care because of maternal death from power line electrocution or barbed wire entanglement. A rare, but apparent natural, occurrence of mass abandonment can lead to the rescue of hundreds of babies at one time. The latter most recently occurred in November 2008 at the Canungra bat camp in South East Queensland, when Wildcare Australia, working closely with the EPA and regional bat care groups, rescued and rehabilitated over 300 baby grey- headed flying foxes. Most babies are in a dehydrated and distressed state by the time they are rescued, and some are infested with maggots if found sick or injured. A young flying fox must be fed every four hours, and then as it develops it is introduced to blossoms and fruit. When the young flying fox is fully weaned around 10 to 12 weeks of age, it goes into a crèche for rehabilitation and eventual release. The NSW Office of Environment and Heritage licences NSW rehabilitation groups under its Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016 and rehabilitation workers to the Code of Practice for Sick, Injured and Orphaned Flying-foxes developed in partnership with NSW Wildlife Council groups and WIRES.

Brewer played slot end/tight end for the Browns until 1966 when he was converted to linebacker with the impending retirement of linebacker Galen Fiss and the presence of first round draft pick Milt Morin. Brewer announced his retirement from professional football in January 1968 to go into the insurance business. Later in the year, Brewer decided he would play football again if the Browns would trade him to a team closer to his home and insurance business. The Browns traded him the New Orleans Saints in mid-August. The Browns acquired a 1970 second round draft pick in exchange for Brewer; they used that pick to draft defensive end Joe “Turkey” Jones.

It is across the road from Valley State Prison. CCWF is the largest female correctional facility in the United States, and houses the only State of California death row for women. Facilities Location of Chowchilla in Madera County, and Madera County in California CCWF covers . As of Fiscal Year 2006/2007, CCWF had a total of 1,205 staff and an annual operating budget of US$138 million. As of April 30, 2020, CCWF was incarcerating people at 131.7% of its design capacity, with 2,640 occupants. CCWF holds prisoners at all security levels: * Reception Center (RC) – provides short term housing to process, classify and evaluate incoming inmates Level I through Level IV are all housed together inside a 32-room housing unit. There are 256 inmates of all levels housed together with only three Correctional Officers. On the Reception Yard there are 276 inmates per housing unit of unclassified inmates supervised by only two officers. * Condemned (Cond) housing – holds inmates with death sentences The prison provides inmate academic education, vocational training, counseling and specialized programs for the purpose of successful reintegration into society. The Center for Restorative Justice (CRJW) Family Express program, provides weekly transportation for family members from major California cities to visit prisoners at the facility. History The Madera County board of supervisors gave the prison its current name in 1989 \\"after months of discussion and disagreement.\\" CCWF opened in October 1990, having cost $141 million to construct. In 1996, the City of Chowchilla was given permission to perform a \\"non-contiguous annexation\\" of CCWF. Starting in April 2007, CCWF received some inmates from California Rehabilitation Center after closure of the women's wing at that prison. The population at CCWF \\"swelled by 8 percent.\\" Health services at CCWF have been the subject of controversy over the years, as exemplified by the following events: * In June 1991, an inmate died; some inmates \\"refused to report to their prison jobs\\" to protest the prison's medical care \\"which they said was linked to the death.\\" Later, an autopsy was conducted to show that the inmate \\"died of acute inflammation of the pancreas,\\" not \\"an overdose of the tranquilizer Haldol\\" as some inmates believed. * Over 100 protesters outside the prison in January 1994 alleged that CCWF \\"failed to provide a medical specialist and educational programs to deal with HIV/AIDS-infected inmates,\\" and that CCWF's healthcare providers \\"often ignore inmate ailments and provide little or no follow-up examinations.\\" * An April 1995 class action lawsuit against CCWF and California Institution for Women \\"allege[d] that inmates suffer terribly and in some cases die because of inadequate medical care.\\" A 1997 settlement agreement led to two reports showing \\"improvements\\" in health care for female prisoners, but plaintiffs' lawyers claimed that \\"the changes deal[t] mostly with medical records, not actual care.\\" * From July to November 1996, a private laboratory billed CCWF $161,000 \\"for thousands of medical tests, including Pap smears to detect cervical cancer, HIV tests, biopsies and urinalyses\\" even though the tests had never been used on the inmates. At least six other prisons also used the laboratory. Although the State of California closed the laboratory in 1997, a 2000 newspaper investigation found that there was \\"little evidence of any attempt by the California Department of Corrections to retest inmates or notify them that their test results were faked.\\" * In 1999, an inmate with \\"hepatitis C and liver disease\\" died after being \\"prescribed anti-TB medications known to be toxic to patients with liver disease.\\" A wrongful-death lawsuit based on the case was \\"settled for $225,000\\" in 2002. * In the \\"month and a half\\" prior to December 20, 2000, seven CCWF inmates died. Of these, four \\"apparently succumbed to chronic terminal illnesses,\\" but an advocacy group claimed that the deaths \\"were precipitated by inadequate care.\\" The other three \\"died suddenly and unexpectedly,\\" which led to autopsies being performed. As a result, the three causes of death were determined to be \\"heart problems and natural causes,\\" \\"a severe asthma attack and chok[ing] on her vomit after a routine strip search,\\" and \\"clogged arteries and an enlarged heart.\\" Nevertheless, \\"relatives of the three women\\" and a physician from the University of California, San Francisco \\"who reviewed their deaths\\" held the opinion that \\"better health care could have saved their lives.\\" * A hospice program was started at CCWF in the summer of 2000, but by mid-2001 was \\"seldom\\" used. One possible explanation was a low amount of funding compared with the men's hospice at California Medical Facility; another possible explanation was CCWF's granting \\"compassionate releases to dying inmates who otherwise might enter the program.\\" * In December 2003, seven CCWF inmates sued seven physicians and \\"several nurses\\" for \\"malpractice, negligence and unprofessional conduct.\\" * In February 2007, the California Office of the Inspector General concluded \\"Numerous studies show that despite an annual cost of $36 million, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation’s in-prison substance abuse treatment programs have little or no impact on recidivism.\\" The report specifically mentioned the \\"New Choice female felon program\\" at CCWF, for which \\"12-month recidivism rates... were lower for non-participants than for participants.\\" Employees As of 2007, of the prison guards, 31% were women. 19% of sergeants were women, and less than 1% of lieutenants are women.

As of 2008 RBTT Holdings had a group asset base of over US$6.2 billion dollars. The RBTT group of companies operated several commercial banking businesses in other neighbouring islands, as well as various investment holdings in various parts of the Trinidad and Tobago economy. On 26 March 2008, RBTT Shareholders voted 98.18 percent in favour of selling the bank to the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), who previously had divested the bank in 1987. On 16 June 2008, RBC completed the acquisition. RBTT Financial Holdings Limited and RBC Holdings (Trinidad & Tobago) Limited, a subsidiary of RBC, will amalgamate and continue as a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of RBC. The head office of the Caribbean operations for RBC will be located at Port of Spain, the capital of Trinidad and Tobago, and the site of RBTT's headquarters. History RBTT's history in Trinidad and Tobago began in 1902 when the Union Bank of Halifax, based in Nova Scotia, Canada, opened a branch in Port of Spain. Union Bank, like many other Canadian banks, was drawn to the West Indies by the flourishing trade between the Canadian Maritimes (e.g. Nova Scotia) with the wider West Indies region. In 1910 the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) acquired the Union Bank. In time RBC expanded its operations from a single location to several different branches across Trinidad and Tobago. In 1962, Trinidad and Tobago gained its independence from the United Kingdom. With several independent countries in the former British West Indies engaging in left-leaning policy experiments, seen by many as heading down the road towards socialism or \\"Communism\\", many Canadian banks were seeking to sever their ties in the Caribbean region so as to avoid having their operations nationalized. *1972 RBC, at the urging of the local government, incorporated the Royal Bank of Trinidad and Tobago (RBTT) to take over its operations in the country. *1985 RBTT formed Caribbean Banking Corporation Limited (CBC), its first venture outside of Trinidad and Tobago, to acquire the branch operations of the Royal Bank of Canada in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. CBC was a 50/50 joint venture with the Neal & Massy Group. CBC is now RBTT Bank Caribbean. By 1986 RBC had divested itself of 53% of its shares in RBTT. Then in 1987 RBC divested itself of its remaining shares in RBTT, putting 100% of its shares in the hands of local shareholders, including 21% in the hands of bank employees. To propel future growth, the bank created the parent holding company known as the Royal Bank of Trinidad and Tobago, Limited for banking operations. In 1990 RBTT decided to transform The Royal Bank of Trinidad and Tobago Limited into a full-fledged regional institution offering financial services across the Caribbean. *1991 CBC (now RBTT Bank Caribbean) established a branch at Bequia, in the Grenadines. *1992 CBC established a branch in Antigua. *1993 CBC established itself in Saint Lucia. *1995 RBTT acquired St. Maarten Commercial Bank and changed its name to Antilles Banking Corporation (Sint Maarten). *1996 RBTT, with the encouragement of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank, acquired a 94% interest in the Nevis Corporative Bank, established in 1955, and changed its name to Caribbean Banking Corporation (SKN). RBTT also acquired Nevis Banking Company (est. 1955), and merged it into CBC (SKN). RBTT acquired the McLaughlin Bank in Curaçao, and changed the name to Antilles Banking Corporation (Curaçao). *1997 RBTT acquired a 50% interest in the Grenada Bank of Commerce (est. 1983), which it has since increased to 62%. RBTT also acquired Neal & Massy’s 50% interest in CBC, making CBC a wholly owned subsidiary. This is now RBTT Bank Caribbean, with branches in St. Lucia, Antigua, St. Vincent, and Bequia, and owns RBTT Bank (SKN) in Nevis and RBTT Bank Grenada. *1998 RBTT acquired the First National Bank of Aruba, with two subsidiaries offering both onshore and offshore services. The bank also formed RBTT Financial Holdings Limited, a new holding company. *1999 Antilles Banking Corporation acquired the operations of the Chase Manhattan Bank in St. Maarten. RBTT restructured its ownership and Grenada Bank of Commerce became a subsidiary of CBC. *2000 RBTT acquired FINSAC's 99.9% shareholding in Union Bank of Jamaica . The bank changed its name to RBTT Bank (Jamaica). Union Bank was the result of a merger of the business of four (4) FINSAC controlled commercial banks and their three (3) allied merchant banks, all seven of which sought Government intervention when faced with insolvency: Citizens Bank; Eagle Commercial Bank; Island Victoria Bank; Workers Savings & Loan Bank; Citizens Merchant Bank; Corporate Merchant Bank; and Island Life Merchant Bank. *2000 Antilles Banking Corporation (Curaçao) N.V acquired all of ABN AMRO branches in Curaçao and Bonaire. Antilles Banking Corporation (Sint Maarten) acquired the operations in Sint Maarten. RBTT merged the operations of ABN AMRO Netherlands Antilles and ABC and continued the combined business under the name RBTT Bank Antilles. ABN AMRO held a minority of the shares in ABC for a maximum period of up to three years. ABN AMRO traced its origins in the Netherlands Antilles back to Edwards, Henriquez & Co., established in 1856 in Curaçao, whose main activity was trade and sea transportation. *2000 First National Bank of Aruba acquired ABN AMRO’s branches in Aruba. RBTT merged the banking activities of ABN AMRO Aruba and First National Bank of Aruba and continued the combined business under the name RBTT Bank Aruba. First National Bank of Aruba also owned Banco Nacional de Hipotecas, a licensed mortgage bank. *2000 RBTT acquired all of ABN AMRO Bank’s branches in Suriname through its wholly owned subsidiary RBTT Bank (Suriname). On 22 April 2002 the bank celebrated its 100th anniversary and rebranded itself legally to the acronym form of the Royal Bank of Trinidad and Tobago or \\"RBTT\\". This led to a regional rebranding of all RBTT businesses of the financial group. Today, all commercial banking subsidiaries carry the RBTT brand in their official name. *2003 RBTT acquired Ernst & Young Trust Corporation in Barbados and renamed it RBTT Trust Corporation. *2004 RBTT acquired Caribbean Commercial Bank in Barbados.

The books take place 16 years after Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. All three novels were authored by Michael P. Kube-McDowell and published by Bantam Books under the imprint Bantam Spectra between March 1996 and November 1998. Books in the trilogy # Before the Storm , published March 1, 1996 # Shield of Lies , published August 1, 1996 # Tyrant's Test , published December 1, 1996 Plot =Background= The Black Fleet Crisis begins in a time of peace for the New Republic, and the first time a chance occurs for the Rebel Alliance to turn their attention to more personal concerns. =Summary= The outbreak of the Black Fleet Crisis ends a period of relative peace in the galaxy. Yevethan forces (former Imperial slaves who overthrew their masters) using captured Imperial ships begin a genocidal campaign to conquer the Koornacht Cluster by killing all non-Yevethans. The New Republic is forced to fight in its own defense, as well as to rescue hostages held by the Yevethans (including Han Solo). After obtaining an image of Han as a battered hostage, Chewbacca goes on a desperate rescue mission. Luke Skywalker travels to his mother's homeworld, Fallanassi, in search of her and her people. Luke meets the Fallanassi, a mysterious and secretive sect of Force users who are total pacifists. Luke learns new Force techniques and philosophies from them, and gains their help to aid the New Republic in one battle. Leia is the only person who doesn't have a chance to rest, who because of her fame, what others expect of her, and her sense of duty and obligation, she has become a prisoner of the Presidency. But she is far too tired, stressed beyond her limits, and emotionally fragile, and she's only two steps away from a serious personal crisis of her confidence. Nil Spaar, the shrewd, coldblooded Machiavellian Viceroy of the Yevethan Protectorate, sees that as an opportunity he can exploit and an opportunity to destroy the New Republic from within. =Battle= The first act of the Battle of N'zoth was even before the New Republic hyperspaced its warships into the vicinity of N'zoth. Fifty hyperspace-capable stasis probes were launched, and they discreetly monitored the Yevethan fleet and relayed their data back to their mother ships. However, even though they were subtle in pinging their targets, forty-seven of them were eventually detected, or else ran out of power. After General A'baht of the Intrepid, commander of the Fifth Fleet, had a good picture of the enemy strength, he gave the order to attack. The three last probes formed in a triangle and began to rapidly and crazily ping the Yevethan fleet, bombarding them with scan rays. This of course negated whatever stealth features they had. The Yevethan political and military leader Nil Spaar, commander of the formerly Imperial Super Star Destroyer Pride of Yevetha, immediately brought the Yevethan flagship and the Interdictor Cruiser Splendor of Yevetha on an intercept course. Before the S.S.D. and the Interdictor could destroy the trio of probes, hundreds of New Republic warships dropped out of hyperspace. General A'baht of the Intrepid knew that the odds of a New Republic victory were slim, given the number of Yevethan thrustships, the Imperator-class Star Destroyers, and the massive flagship Pride of Yevetha. However, the wily Dornean fleet commander had a card to play, and there was another unknown factor in the battle. The Black Fleet Crisis had its origins with the enslavement of the Yevetha aliens by the Galactic Empire at a dozen worlds in the Koornacht Cluster. Twelve years before the Battle of N'zoth, a particularly ambitious Yevetha named Nil Spaar led a revolt, and the shipbuilding aliens turned on their captors, capturing dozens of Imperator- class Star Destroyers, three Super Star Destroyers, and also a handful of massive Imperial shipyards. Imperial High Command immediately withdrew from the Cluster when the danger became apparent, but it was too late, and the Yevetha controlled Black Sword Command and its flagship, the Intimidator, which the Yevetha renamed the Pride of Yevetha. It was time for the Imperial slaves to now reverse history. Five hundred of them spread on three former Imperial warships: the Pride of Yevetha and the two Star Destroyers Harramin and Valorous rebelled simultaneously, overwhelming their captors in specific locations on the three starships. Then, the Imperials sent an unjammable hypercomm transmission to all the Imperial-made starships, activating all their hyperdrives, sending them all to the planet of Byss, ironically completing the withdrawal of Black Sword Command from the Koornacht Cluster, which had been ordered twelve long years ago. The remaining group of over twenty Yevethan thrustships relentlessly advanced. They were outgunned, but had the capability to inflict horrible casualties on the New Republic fleet. However, the New Republic general had a Fallanini Force-caster on board the Intrepid. The Fallanini were a peaceful race of Force-sensitive people before the Yevetha seized control of the Koornacht. They used their powers to hide their small colony in the midst of a jungle world from probing Yevetha sensors, and continued to live as normal. However, Luke Skywalker convinced them to rise against the Yevetha actively and for them to strike the final blow. One of the Fallanini used a spell, creating the illusions of dozens of New Republic warships, making the Fifth Fleet look fifty percent larger than it really was. The thrustships methodically fired on the phantoms, not knowing that their energy beams were slashing into illusions. However, the Force- caster was overwhelmed, and after a while, the imaginary \\"Task Force Token\\" vanished, and the Yevetha fleet concentrated their firepower on the real targets. There were many casualties: Commander Farley's Star Destroyer Yakez, the fleet carrier Ballarat, the Aboukir, the Banshee, the Fulimnant, the Garland, the Thunderhead, the Werra, and hundreds and hundreds of New Republic starfighters of various classifications. At the end, the desperate Yevetha even used their trifoil fighters as suicide bombers, crippling several New Republic warships, and used whatever thrustships left to detonate, taking out New Republic starships in their blast radii. However, the New Republic triumphed, and the Yevetha military was shattered.

Plot Although Michael has become a more mature individual since the first film and shows more concern for others, he still feels that, by birthright, he deserves to start at the top of his father's law firm. Michael's father does offer him a position at the law firm: a clerking job, and explains that only after thorough knowledge of the firm, a law school graduation, and passing the state bar will he ever be considered for a partnership. Michael takes a summer vacation with Tommy to Australia. Michael has big plans to show his cousin Tommy a good time aboard a luxury yacht, until he discovers that the yacht he chartered is actually an old, rusty fishing boat. But when modern-day pirates chase the fishing boat, the boys are forced to jump ship, leaving them stranded on a desert island. The pirates are led by Frakes, who earlier had pick-pocketed Michael and discovered through his ID that he comes from a wealthy family. The pirates plan to kidnap Michael for a large ransom. Meanwhile, Tommy and Michael struggle to find their way on the island to be met by the boat's captain, Jake Hunter, who scuttled the fishing boat to lose the pirates. He later admits he hated being a fishing boat captain and only stuck with it because it was his late-father's calling. After several days the pirates finally find the boys when Michael shoots a flare gun to get an airplanes attention. As they attempt to leave the island on their raft two of the pirates approach them. Michael and Jake swim away and leave Tommy who can't get his life jacket off behind, promising to rescue him later. Michael and Jake come up with a plan to get Tommy back. Jake and Tommy outwit the pirates by absconding in their speedboat, Frakes attempts to shoot Michael, but fails due to his firearm being gunked up with quicksand he had gotten trapped in earlier while chasing Michael; leaving the villains stranded. As the boys escape they call the Australian Coast Guard for help. The pirates are arrested and their speedboat is seized. During a lunch the boys have with Michael's father and Tommy's mom, Michael arrives and tells Jake and Tommy that due to asset forfeiture, Frakes' boat is now their property. Michael proposes using the speedboat, combined with the reward money, to launch a boat tour service with Jake and Tommy as his partners, and Jake captaining the boat. Michael also tells his father that he will begin the process for law school application, and accepts his dad's clerking job to help him prepare for that.

Groom believed in adhering to the Concession and Agreement of John Lord Berkekey and Sir George Carteret, which stated that one seventh part of all land allotments was to be reserved to the Lords Proprietors. Rudyard disagreed with this policy and he and the Council appointed Philip Wells as Deputy Surveyor, thereby circumventing Groom's authority. The Proprietors in England disapproved of Rudyard and Wells' actions, voiding all grants not surveyed by Groom.

In March 1686 the Proprietors appointed Andrew Hamilton to oversee the investigation. During Gawen Lawrie's tenure the Proprietors in England drafted a new constitution for East New Jersey, the Fundamental Constitutions for the Province of East New Jersey.The Grants, Concessions and Original Constitutions of the Province of New Jersey, Aaron Leaming and Jacob Spicer; W.

A master's jurisdiction is generally confined to civil proceedings and is a subset of that of a justice. Masters are typically involved in hearing trials, case management, and in some jurisdictions dispute resolution or adjudication of specific issues referred by judges. Besides the courts of England and Wales, masters may be found in the Republic of Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, several Caribbean countries and a number of Canadian provinces. Several state courts in the United States utilize masters or similar officers and also make extensive use of special masters. Judicial officials exercising a master's jurisdiction are in some jurisdictions referred to as Registrars and Deputy Registrars. England and Wales In England and Wales a master is a sworn judge in the High Court having a jurisdiction similar to that of a Justice of the High Court in civil matters within the division of the court to which the master is appointed. The role of a master in the High Court of Justice of England and Wales is concerned primarily with trial and case management of High Court civil claims in London excluding committals to prison, judicial review and criminal cases. There are masters in the Queen's Bench and Chancery Divisions and the Costs Office (Taxing Masters/Costs Judges) and their roles differ slightly.http://www.justice.gov.uk/guidance/courts-and- tribunals/courts/chancery-division/chancery-chambers.htm Such a person is addressed in court as, for example, \\"Master Smith\\". This is so whether the master is male or female, or as either 'Master' or 'Judge'. A similar type of master exists in the Court system of Northern Ireland, in several Canadian and Australian jurisdictions as well as in other countries whose court system is based on that of England. The office of master is of ancient origins dating from at least the 12th century, though masters in Chancery were abolished in the 19th century and a new office of Chancery Master was recreated later. There are masters in the Chancery and Queen's Bench divisions of the High Court of Justice and the Costs Office of the High Court. The Senior Master of the Queen's Bench Division also bears the title of Queen's Remembrancer which is one of the oldest judicial offices in England. In the Inns of Court, the members of the governing body are known as \\"Masters of the Bench\\" or, more commonly, \\"benchers\\". In the context of the functions they perform in that capacity (but not otherwise) they will be known as, for example, \\"Master Smith\\" (whether they are male or female). This will be so even if in other contexts they use a higher title: hence, a High Court Judge who is a Master of the Bench will be known in his or her Inn as \\"Master Smith\\", in private life as Sir John Smith, and on the bench as Mr Justice Smith; likewise a law lord will be known in the inn as \\"Master Woolf\\" even if he is privately and professionally known by the peerage title of \\"Lord Woolf\\". Hong Kong The High Court's Registrar, Senior Deputy Registrars and Deputy Registrars serve as Masters of the High Court in civil cases in the court's Court of First Instance.2001 Hong Kong Government Year Book Republic of Ireland Under the Court Officers Act 1926, the Master of the High Court and taxing masters are not judges but rather \\"quasi-judicial office holders\\". Canada In Canada the structure of the court system is primarily a provincial responsibility and the superior courts of the provinces have different names. Masters are found in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta, the Court of Queen's Bench of Manitoba and the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. There are part-time taxing masters in the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador. There is a similar office of prothonotary in the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island and in the Federal Court. The jurisdiction of a Master is fixed by provincial statute and the rules of court. Masters are appointed by the provincial government. As a result, while Masters sit in a superior court, they do not have the \\"inherent jurisdiction\\" of the judges of those courts, who are appointed by the federal government and whose authority is derived from the Constitution of Canada and the Crown. Their jurisdiction is usually limited to procedural and Interlocutory matters heard in chambers. Consequently, though of the superior court, Masters are concurrently subordinate to the judges of that court insofar as application of judicial precedent is concerned.http://whois.incourt.ca/judicial-pecking- order/ Judicial Pecking Order Masters commonly also sit as Registrars in Bankruptcy. In the Federal Court of Canada, a judicial officer with much the same powers as a Master is called a Prothonotary. Traditionally a Master is referred to as \\"Master Smith\\" or, in court, as \\"Master\\". In some jurisdictions, Masters are now referred to as \\"your honour\\". Masters and Prothonotaries are independent judicial officers although they do not have the full level of security of tenure afforded to federally appointed judges. In Alberta, British Columbia and Manitoba, masters have the same terms of appointment as provincial judges. This was formerly the case in Ontario as well but after the High Court of Justice and District Courts were merged, in 1986 a new office of Case Management Master was created. In Ontario Case Management Masters have all of the authority of traditional masters as well as additional jurisdiction to manage actions and engage in dispute resolution processes. They are appointed by Order in Council and can only be removed for cause by the Chief Justice following a formal disciplinary process.http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90c43_e.htm In Ontario the distinction between \\"chambers\\" and \\"court\\" has been abolished. When masters preside they sit as the court and their function is to perform tasks that would otherwise fall to superior court judges. Besides the jurisdiction to hear most interlocutory motions in civil matters, case management masters in Ontario also preside at status hearings, case conferences and pre-trials. They frequently act as referees to hear trials in construction lien matters, mortgage references or issues referred by judges. Case management masters also provide dispute resolution services and sit as Registrars in Bankruptcy. New Zealand In the High Court of New Zealand, Associate Judges perform the same role as Masters in the High Court of Justice in England and Wales. They were previously referred to as Masters, however the title was changed on 20 May 2004, and all existing Masters were renamed Associate Judges.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 2, 2003. In the episode, George Sr. is about to announce his retirement when he is arrested for using his company's funds for personal expenses. It was written by series creator and executive producer Mitchell Hurwitz and was directed by Anthony and Joe Russo. An uncensored, extended version of the episode was released as a special feature on the DVD home release. Plot For ten years, Michael Bluth had been waiting for his father, George Sr., to make him a partner in their family company. On the morning of his father's retirement boat party, Michael discusses the announcement of his promotion with his son, George Michael. The two of them are living in one of the Bluths' model homes, to show their support for the business. After dropping his son off at the frozen banana stand his father started, Michael goes to see his oldest brother Gob (an amateur magician), to ask for his check to cover party expenses. Gob tells Michael that their sister Lindsay had been staying at the Four Seasons for a month. Upset by both Lindsay's avoidance of him and her abuse of the company's largesse, Michael goes to tell his mother, Lucille, that the company checkbook is closing. At the banana stand, George Michael's cousin Maeby plays a prank on him, taking advantage of the fact that he does not recognize her. The kids discuss how they never see each other, and Maeby suggests they kiss at the boat party to teach their parents that the cousins need to see each other more often. Back at the hotel, Lindsay's husband Tobias, believing that the boat party is pirate-themed because of a joke from Michael, begins trying on Lindsay's blouses. He mistakes a group of garishly dressed men for pirates, and boards a van full of homosexual protesters. Finally, George Sr. gives his retirement speech, and appoints the new CEO: his wife Lucille. The dismayed Michael decides it is time to move on. The family poses for a photo; Maeby goes through with her previous suggestion and kisses George Michael as the SEC raids the ship. George Sr. calls his secretary with instructions on what to do. Lindsay takes command of the boat and Lucille tells Buster, her youngest son, to find a channel to the ocean on the maps. Buster, despite his cartography lessons, can only offer certainty that the blue part of the map is land before a panic attack sets in. The SEC hauls George Bluth away, leaving the family in turmoil. At the police station, Tobias joins up with the family and tells them he discovered that the men on the other boat with him were in fact actors from the local theater. Believing that a path has been shown to him, Tobias informs the family that he has decided to become an actor. Michael then informs the family that their dad is being kept in jail, and the SEC is putting a halt on the company's expense account. Lucille decides to put Buster in charge. This is too much for Michael, who accepts a job in Arizona with a rival development company. When Buster discovers his academic pursuits didn't prepare him for running a big company, the family turns to Michael, begging for his help. Michael rejects their imposition, but Lindsay says he should visit their father before leaving. Michael does indeed visit his father in jail, asking why he wasn't put in charge. George informs him that he put Lucille in charge because he believes they cannot arrest a husband and wife for the same crime. Michael tells him that is not true, and George curses the advice of his attorneys. At the model home, Lindsay is trying to steal some belongings that she can grab and sell when she comes across George Michael. He opens up his heart, saying he wishes the family could see each other more often, and when Michael sees this, he decides to stay in California and try to save the family business. =On the next Arrested Development...= Having to share a room with his cousin Maeby, George Michael begins to feel awkward. Gob interviews for a job with the rival development company Michael interviewed for earlier, and at the county jail, George Sr. tells Michael that he's \\"having the time of [his] life.\\" Development Discussion that led to the creation of the series began in the summer of 2002. Ron Howard had the original idea to create a comedy in the style of hand-held cameras and reality television, but with an elaborate, highly comical script resulting from repeated rewritings and rehearsals. Howard met with David Nevins, the President of Imagine Television, Katie O'Connell, a senior vice president, and two writers, including Mitchell Hurwitz. In light of recent corporate accounting scandals, such as Enron and Adelphia, Hurwitz suggested a story about a \\"riches to rags\\" family. Howard and Imagine were immediately interested in using this idea, and signed Hurwitz on to write the show. The idea was pitched and sold in the fall of 2002. Over the next few months, Hurwitz developed the characters and plot to the series. The pilot script was submitted in January 2003, and filmed in March 2003. It was submitted in late April, and added to the Fox fall schedule in May. Tony Hale, who plays Buster, recalled that \\"we didn't really improv that much, because we knew [Mitchell Hurwitz] had a specific way he wanted it done\\". =Casting= The most difficult part for casting the series involved finding people who would be believable as a family. Alia Shawkat was the first person cast. Michael Cera, Tony Hale, and Jessica Walter were cast from video tapes and flown in to audition for Fox. Jason Bateman and Portia de Rossi both read and auditioned for the network and were immediately chosen. The character of Gob was the most challenging to cast. When Will Arnett auditioned, he depicted the character with a \\"macho\\" streak different from expectations; he was chosen immediately. The characters of Tobias and George Sr. were originally going to have minor roles, but David Cross's and Jeffrey Tambor's portrayals mixed well with the rest of the characters, and they were given more significant parts. Ron Howard, the executive producer, provided the narration for the initial pilot but meshed so well with the tone of the program that the decision was made to stick with his voice. Howard also aided in the casting of \\"Lucille 2\\"; the producers told him that their dream actress for the role would be Liza Minnelli but assumed nobody of her stature would take the part. However, she agreed when Ron Howard asked her himself, because they were old friends; she had been his babysitter when he was a child and she was a teen.(2004-08-20). \\"Friends in high places\\", Evening Standard, p. 13. Reception =Critical reception= The New York Times critic Alessandra Stanley said that comparisons to The Royal Tenenbaums were unfair, noting that Arrested Development dropped the \\"highbrow precociousness\\" of that film. She praised the \\"dry, deadpan tone\\" and \\"offbeat satire\\", saying that the \\"humor lies in balancing the characters' loopiness with sly, satisfying digs at the rich.\\" Tim Goodman praised the \\"film quality\\" and \\"comic beauty\\" of the series, while lauding Bateman's performance as \\"stunningly great\\". Goodman also said the series was too funny to survive, comparing it to the recently cancelled series Andy Richter Controls The Universe. Matt Roush of TV Guide said that the Pilot demonstrated it was \\"sophisticated and invigorating in its barbed wit and freewheeling blackouts and flashbacks\\" and praised the lack of a laugh track. Robert Bianco of USA Today wrote a largely positive review, exalting the performances of the entire ensemble cast, but called Bateman the standout. He, did, however, feel the series went too far outside the norm with the cousin storyline between George-Michael and Maeby, referring to it as \\"alarming\\". The A.V. Club writer Noel Murray wrote that the series premiere used its time well, saying that \\"between the on-screen titles, the narration, the quick insert shots, the brief flashbacks, and the rapid-fire dialogue, creator Mitchell Hurwitz and his team of writers, directors, and editors impart massive amounts of information in a short span of time.\\" =Accolades= The pilot was honored at the 56th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards. Mitchell Hurwitz won Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series for writing the pilot episode. During his acceptance speech, Hurwitz joked, \\"This is such a huge honor and, I fear, a giant mistake.\\" Joe and Anthony Russo also won Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series for their directorial work on this episode.

Churrigueresque Obradoiro façade Basilica and Convent of Nuestra Señora de la Merced, Lima Churrigueresque (; Spanish: Churrigueresco), in a lesser extent it was also called \\"Ultra Baroque\\", refers to a Spanish Baroque style of elaborate sculptural architectural ornament which emerged as a manner of stucco decoration in Spain in the late 17th century and was used up to about 1750, marked by extreme, expressive and florid decorative detailing, normally found above the entrance on the main facade of a building. Origins Named after the architect and sculptor, José Benito de Churriguera (1665–1725), who was born in Madrid and who worked primarily in Madrid and Salamanca, the origins of the style are said to go back to an architect and sculptor named Alonso Cano, who designed the facade of the cathedral at Granada, in 1667. A distant, early 15th century precursor of the highly elaborate Churrigueresque style can be found in the Lombard Charterhouse of Pavia, yet the sculpture-encrusted facade still has the Italianate appeal to rational narrative. Churrigueresque appeals to the proliferative geometry and it is an intense evolution of Baroque, influenced by the same Baroque. Development The development of the style passed through three phases. Between 1680 and 1720, the Churriguera popularized Guarino Guarini's blend of Solomonic columns and composite order, known as \\"supreme order\\". Between 1720 and 1760, the Churrigueresque column, or estipite, in the shape of an inverted cone or obelisk, was established as a central element of ornamental decoration. The years from 1760 to 1780 saw a gradual shift of interest away from twisted movement and excessive ornamentation towards neoclassical balance and sobriety. Among the highlights of the style, interiors of the Granada Charterhouse offer some of the most impressive combinations of space and light in 18th-century Europe. Integrating sculpture and architecture even more radically, Narciso Tomé achieved striking chiaroscuro effects in his Transparente for the Toledo Cathedral. Perhaps the most visually intoxicating form of the style was Mexican Churrigueresque, practised in the mid-18th century by Lorenzo Rodriguez, whose masterpiece is the Sagrario Metropolitano (1749–69) in Mexico City, New Spain. Spain The first of the Churriguera was José Benito de Churriguera (1665–1725), who trained as a joiner of altarpieces, drawing some very important for various churches of Salamanca, Madrid, Valladolid and other cities in Spain. Some in Spain have gone and some remain only a sites: *Nuevo Baztán, Community of Madrid **Church of St Francisco Javier and Goyeneche Palace *Salamanca, Castile and León **Altarpiece of Convent of San Esteban **Choir of the New Cathedral. **Plaza Mayor. **Capilla de la Vera Cruz **College of Calatrava *Seville **Palace of San Telmo Mexico In Mexico, the Cathedral Basilica of Zacatecas, Zacatecas, capital of Zacatecas state, and the Templo de Santa Prisca, located in Taxco, Guerrero state are considered as masterpieces of Churrigueresque style. The building of Parroquia Antigua in Salamanca, Guanajuato, founded on August 24, 1603, was completed in the year 1690, and the Churrigueresque facade in 1740. The altarpiece of the church of San Francisco Javier (National Museum of Viceroyalty) in Tepotzotlán, State of Mexico is also considered, along with its facade, one of the most important baroque churrigueresque works created by the Jesuits in New Spain. The Altar de los Reyes of the Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral and the facades of the Sagrario Metropolitano, by the Spanish architect Lorenzo Rodriguez. which is attached to the same Cathedral, are also representatives of the style. The Philippines It was late introduced in the Philippines. The best examples were the San Juan de dios Hospital in Intramuros, Daraga Church in Albay, and Tigbauan Church in Iloilo. California Churrigueresque Revival The Casa del Prado Theater, at Balboa Park, San Diego, California. Churrigueresque Revival. California Churrigueresque is a revival style native to California, developed in the early 20th century by architects Bertram Goodhue and Carleton Winslow Sr. for the 1915 Panama-California Exposition, which helped popularize its use in Spanish Colonial Revival architecture in California, and to a lesser extent the rest of the United States. Goodhue and Winslow developed the style after studying Churrigueresque and Plateresque ornamentation in Spanish Colonial buildings in Mexico. Many of the best examples of California Churrigeresque are located in Balboa Park in San Diego, the site of the Panama-California Exposition. Other notable buildings in this style include San Francisco's Mission Dolores Basilica, the First Congregational Church of Riverside, Los Angeles's St. Vincent de Paul Church, and Beverly Hills City Hall.LA Curbed - Beverly Hills Landmarking 1932 Churrigueresque City Hall See also * Baroque * Architecture of the Spanish Renaissance * Spanish Colonial architecture * Rococo * Spanish architecture * Mexican architecture References ;Bibliography * Pevsner, Fleming and Honour, The Penguin Dictionary of Architecture, Penguin Books, Middlesex, England, 1983 * Kelemen, Pal, Baroque and Rococo in Latin America, Dover Publications Inc., New York, volumes I and II, 1967 Churrigueresque Churrigueresque Churrigueresque Architectural history ","title":"Churrigueresque"},{"id":"4314246","text":"Oud-Kamerik is a town in the Dutch province of Utrecht.

On the Morris Ticket was the proposal for a student-run low power radio station. The radio station was initially proposed in May 1967 prior to the student council election. The student council election was held on May 20, 1967. Jesse Morris was elected Student Council President for the Class of 1968. On May 23, Robert Huber (also Class of 1968) was appointed radio station manager and project coordinator. The school administration were helpful and supportive of this ambitious project. On February 19, 1968, the Mount Pleasant Board of Education submitted the FCC application. The FCC issued a non- commercial FM low power educational radio station construction permit to the school board on October 15, 1968. This was the first permit of its kind to be granted for the State of Delaware. WMPH radio first signed on the air October 1, 1969. The faculty advisor was Ron Webster under the direction of school district administrator Jack Vinokur. WMPH began broadcasting with 1.52 watts effective radiated power from a tower atop the school. In 1975 the station increased its output to 28.2 watts ERP. WMPH reaches over a half million potential listeners in Wilmington Delaware and surrounding communities. In 1980 the station increased its output to 100 watts ERP and replaced its horizontally polarized antenna with a circularly polarized antenna for better reception on car radios. Located at Mount Pleasant High School and part of the Brandywine School District, WMPH currently broadcasts at 100 watts ERP and serves as part of the Broadcast Learning Center of Mount Pleasant High School. WMPH was known as \\"The Non-Commercial Rock Station\\" during its heyday in the 1970s with a Top 40 and Progressive Rock format. The station was entirely operated by Mount Pleasant High School students many of whom went on to careers in the radio broadcasting industry. Original studios were in the basement of the high school. The station kept broadcasting hours before the school day with announcers such as \\"The Dutchman\\" Guy VanderLek and \\"Big Al\\" Ingalls. After the school day the station would sign back on at 3 PM with more student announcers including Joy VanderLek (who went on to be an air talent at Connecticut Radio Network), Bruce Weiner, Stephen D. Streiker, David Mackenzie, Steve Balick, Leigh Jacobs, and Mike Schwartz (to name a very few). Well known Broadway actor John Dossett was an announcer (1972–1976) while he attended Mount Pleasant. The radio station was dark (off the air) from 1990–1993. The school district actually forfeited the FCC broadcast license and nearby West Chester University was trying to obtain it. Clint Dantinne gave a proposal to the superintendent to resurrect the defunct station. Had he not interceded at that time, WMPH would have been closed permanently. Under his management, WMPH returned to the air March 1, 1993. It was at this time he chose 'Super 91.7' as the new slogan. Clint Dantinne founded the Broadcast Learning Center incorporating radio, television, film club, recording studio, puppets, newspaper, and web team at Mount Pleasant High School. Dantinne remained the faculty manager until the end of the 2010 school year. WMPH has always been located at Mount Pleasant High School (Wilmington, Delaware) on the corner of Washington Street Extension and Marsh Road with the exception of the 1995–1996 school year. The entire building was renovated and the radio studios were temporarily moved to a trailer at the Claymont Education Center. During the past 40 years, the station had been a training ground for many aspiring broadcasters. Alumni include WSTW's Mike Rossi (inducted in the Mount Pleasant Hall of Fame under real name William Schwartz on October 28, 2011) and Clear Channel Radio executive Leigh Jacobs. Dave Mays, DJ for MTV Spring Break and Sirius Satellite Radio, first learned the trade at WMPH in the 90s. WMPH was also one of two non-commercial stations owned by school districts in the United States that programmed a continuous Dance music format, KNHC/Seattle, Washington is the other. The new WMPH has switched formats to include a wider array of programming including classic/progressive rock, alternative, jazz, and various student/district related functions including interviews, sports, and band/choral concert events. The 40th anniversary of WMPH was celebrated on October 23, 2009 at the Mount Pleasant Hall of Fame induction ceremony. The event, held every two years around homecoming weekend, was celebrated at the nearby Brandywine Hundred Fire Company. The Mount Pleasant Hall of Fame CLASS OF 2009 inductees were Arthur Colbourn, John Crum, Carol Hoffecker, Rodney Lambert, John Jancuska, and WMPH founders Jesse Morris and Bob Huber. Dr. Jesse Morris was introduced by student Haley Hirzel and then his wife. Bob Huber was introduced by student Todd Hartsock. Teacher Kelli Bradley presented the plaque to our final inductee of the evening. Student Alex Sprague then introduced WMPH manager Clint Dantinne who gave a multimedia presentation. On June 11, 2010, WMPH went \\"silent\\" while a new manager was sought. During this transition period, the school district decided to refurbish the studios with a new look and brand new equipment. The broadcast operation returned nearly a year later on June 3, 2011. The new operation is under the direction and management of radio industry veteran Paul Lewis (Wishengrad) formerly of WJBR and BSD Information Systems Director, Pat Bush.

In topology and in calculus, a round function is a scalar function Mto{mathbb{R}}, over a manifold M, whose critical points form one or several connected components, each homeomorphic to the circle S^1, also called critical loops. They are special cases of Morse- Bott functions. The black circle in one of this critical loops. For instance For example, let M be the torus. Let :K=(0,2pi)times(0,2pi)., Then we know that a map :Xcolon Kto{mathbb{R}}^3, given by :X(theta,phi)=((2+costheta)cosphi,(2+costheta)sinphi,sintheta), is a parametrization for almost all of M.

These two values for theta give the critical sets :X({pi/2},phi)=(2cosphi,2sinphi,1), :X({3pi/2},phi)=(2cosphi,2sinphi,-1), which represent two extremal circles over the torus M. Observe that the Hessian for this function is :{rm hess}(G)= begin{bmatrix} -sintheta & 0  0 & 0 end{bmatrix} which clearly it reveals itself as rank of {rm hess}(G) equal to one at the tagged circles, making the critical point degenerate, that is, showing that the critical points are not isolated. Round complexity Mimicking the L–S category theory one can define the round complexity asking for whether or not exist round functions on manifolds and/or for the minimum number of critical loops.

Colin Irwin from the music magazine Mojo said Bailey represented \\"the very soul of folk's working class ideals... a triumphal homage to the grass roots folk scene as a radical alternative to the mainstream music industry.\\" Biography Bailey began his musical career in a skiffle band in 1958, and later joined folk supergroup the Three City Four featuring Leon Rosselson, as a replacement for Martin Carthy. His first solo album was released in 1971. He performed a number of songs by the American singer-songwriter Si Kahn and was also renowned as a singer of children's songs, often using material written by his old partner Leon Rosselson. Oats & Beans & Kangaroos is an album of children's songs performed by Roy & Val Bailey with Leon Rosselson. Bailey worked with Robb Johnson and others on the award-winning Gentle Men album, released in 1997 and re-recorded and released in 2013. In 2003, Bailey and Tony Benn were awarded \\"Best Live Act\\" at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards for their programme Writing on the Wall, later an album. Tony Benn cited Roy Bailey as \\"the greatest socialist folk singer of his generation.\\" In the 2000 Honours List, he received the MBE for Services to Folk Music. On 23 August 2006, he returned his MBE insignia in protest at the British government's foreign policy with regard to Lebanon and the Palestinian territories. He contributed vocals to Chumbawamba's 2008 album The Boy Bands Have Won, on the track \\"Word Bomber\\", a song about the London suicide attacks in 2005. He also joined the band on stage to sing the song, on their farewell Leeds show in October 2012. In 2016, Roy released his first live album, Live at Towersey Festival 2015, which was recorded in secret at the festival and featured guest appearances from Martin Simpson and Andy Cutting.\\"Roy Bailey announces first ever live album\\" , \\"Folking\\", August 2016 The album contained songs written by Si Kahn, Bob Dylan, Tom Waits, John Tams, Robb Johnson and others. Roy appeared at the very first Towersey Festival in 1965 and his well established Monday afternoon concert regularly drew a crowd of around 1000. Roy Bailey was an Emeritus Professor of Social Studies at Sheffield Hallam University. He was also the patron of Towersey Village Festival, Shepley Spring Festival and the Music on the Marr Festival based in the village of Castle Carrock, Cumbria. He was the father-in-law of Martin Simpson, a singer and guitarist, whose wife Kit is Bailey's daughter.

It is centrally located in the heart of Manhattan and has long catered to wealthy elites and celebrities. It is owned by Warwick Hotels and Resorts. Architecture and design The 36-floor Renaissance Revival building was designed by Emery Roth in association with the architectural firm of George B. Post & Sons. The hotel's three-story base is covered with limestone and granite. The brown brick superstructure has two wings projecting to the street from the property line. The wings set back several times, receding into the main slab—itself thinning into a top tower after further setbacks. The overall shape of the structure has a strong vertical thrust. History William Randolph Hearst built the Warwick New York in 1926 for $5 million. Long catering to the elite, Hearst built the 36-story residential tower to accommodate his Hollywood friends as well as his mistress, the actress Marion Davies, who had her own specially-designed floor in the building. The hotel's restaurant, Murals on 54, features the 1937 murals of American illustrator Dean Cornwell. The famed murals were fully restored following a 2004 renovation of the restaurant. The Warwick is also home to Randolph's Bar & Lounge, whose rosebud leitmotif references Hearst's purported nickname for Marion Davies. The owner of the Warwick New York is Warwick Hotels and Resorts, which was founded in 1980 with the purchase of this hotel by its chairman, Richard Chiu. Prominent guests According to the Warwick Hotel website, James Dean, Jane Russell, Elizabeth Taylor, Meyer Lansky, and Elvis Presley were frequent guests. Actor Cary Grant resided at the Warwick and lived in the hotel for 12 years. During one of The Beatles trip to the U.S., they stayed in the Warwick.

Biography Alan McGilvray was born in Paddington, a suburb of Sydney, one of four children of Dumfries-born Thomas McGilvray, owner of a city shoe warehouse.Inside Out: Writings on Cricket Culture, Gideon Haigh, Melbourne University Press, 2008, p. 195 The family were keen on cricket: \\"he played as a child in New South Wales with his father, Thomas, bowling to him, and his brother Norman keeping wicket behind the kerosene can.\\"\\"Australia's 'Bradman' of the Commentary Box\\" by Richard Yallop in The Best Ever Australian Sports Writing: A 200-year collection, ed.

He captained New South Wales in the 1935-36 and 1936-37 seasons.Alan McGilvray at Cricket Archive His radio commentary career spanned over 50 years, starting in an era where the only communications between England and Australia were ball- by-ball telegraph cables which were embellished with sound effects and commentary to give an impression of being at the game. The technique was first used in 1934 and became known as synthetic cricket broadcasts. By the 1938 Ashes series in England, short wave reception to Australia had improved significantly and commentary started moving to conventional broadcasting. McGilvray called every Test in Australia from the Second World War until his retirement in 1985.The Oxford Companion to Australian Cricket, OUP, Melbourne, 1996, p. 351. An example of his distinctive commentary style is as follows: > Farnes turns, runs in bowling to Bradman, it's a ball well-pitched. Bradman > moves forward, drives, Compton at cover tries to cut it off, he's beaten by > the pace of the ball and it races away for another four. APPLAUSE.

She was daughter of William Cavendish, Duke of Newcastle, and later the wife of Charles Cheyne, Viscount Newhaven, Along with her literary achievements, Jane helped manage her father's properties while he spent the English Civil War in exile; she was responsible for a variety of military correspondences and for salvaging many of her family's valuable possessions. Later in life, Jane became an important community member in Chelsea. She used her money and resources to make improvements on Chelsea Church and to otherwise benefit her friends and neighbours. Marked by vitality, integrity, perseverance, and creativity, Jane's life and works tell the story of a Royalist woman's indomitable spirit during the English Civil War and Restoration in England. Early life Born in 1621 to William Cavendish and his first wife, Elizabeth Basset Howard, Jane Cavendish grew up in a prosperous and loving environment. Much of the wealth that William possessed had been accumulated by his grandmother, the Renaissance property magnate Elizabeth Hardwick, Countess of Shrewsbury—better known as Bess of Hardwick. Bess's properties, her fortune, and her remarkable tapestries were important inheritances of William's family, and Bess herself provided a template of autonomous female behaviour for William's daughters. Throughout his life, William added to Bess's wealth and properties—in part by marrying Howard, who was a rich widowed heiress at the time of their marriage. Adjacent to his social and monetary ambitions were William Cavendish's tremendous literary ambitions, which he aspired toward in his own writings but homed in on most thoroughly by developing relationships with a wide range of poets and playwrights including Ben Jonson, Thomas Shadwell, and John Dryden. Because of her father's literary and political connections, Jane's world was—from the start—replete in the excesses that typified Charles I's court. She had a number of elegant gowns, many made of sumptuous velvets, and a fine collection of garments and linens. More significant than these signs of her social standing, however, are some early traces of her literary development. In one of her father's manuscript books (now University of Nottingham MSS Portland Collection, Pw V 25:21–22), Jane responded to her father's couplet \\"Sweet Jane / I know you are a rare Inditer.— / And hath the Pen off a moste redye writer. / W.N.\\" with the following lines: \\"My Lord / I know you doo but Jest with mee / & so in obdence I right this nothing / Jane Cavendysshe.\\" It is worth noting that although William wrote similar couplets to each of his children, only Jane and one of her brothers recorded a response—and Jane's is by far the cleverer of the two. Her father's assessment of her as “a moste redye writer” carried over into her adult life, when she collaborated with her sister on some literary documents and also wrote her own poetry. The English Civil Wars As for other staunch Royalists, the English Civil War was a trying time for the Cavendish family. The closing of the theatres in 1642 would have been of especial significance for them, since William had written plays that were publicly performed before the war and his daughters were familiar with the networks of theatre culture that ranged from public theatrical performances to private readings of dramas. Of course, the closing of the theatres was not the most traumatic event of the Civil War for the Cavendish family. Elizabeth Basset Howard died in 1643, leaving her children in possession of her money but without her guidance and compassion. Soon after his first wife's death, William was defeated in a critical battle at Marston Moor. He subsequently fled to France, leaving his daughters to maintain his property at Welbeck Abbey on their own. Welbeck Abbey was captured by Parliamentarian forces on 2 August 1644. Although Royalists briefly recaptured the home in 1645, they surrendered it in November. Amid these volatile circumstances, Jane and her sisters Elizabeth and Frances twice entertained Charles I at Welbeck in 1645. After Charles's execution in 1649, however, the sisters' world took on a grimmer tone. Their father was labelled a traitor, and they were forced to live under house arrest, where the conduct of the Parliamentarian troops was often rude at best. Jane continued to work toward preserving her family's possessions. She managed to barter with Royalist soldiers to have her father's valuable Van Dyck paintings and some tapestries moved to safety, and she and Frances sent out letters that provided information to the Royalist army about the status of Welbeck and its surroundings. Moreover, during this period of unrest, Jane and her sister Elizabeth began compiling a variety of manuscript writings that they probably started working on as early as 1635—although most of the contents were written during the Civil War. These works, which were copied by their father's scribe John Rollston, are now held by the Beinecke and Bodleian libraries. Beinecke Osborn MS b. 233 is a presentation copy manuscript of poetry written exclusively by Jane. Bodleian Library, MS Rawl., Poet. 16 is a larger compilation, titled Poems Songs a Pastorall and a Play by the Right Honorable the Lady Jane Cavendish and Lady Elizabeth Brackley, comprising writings by Jane and Elizabeth. The sisters' individual contributions are noted in the margins by Rollston. The sisters' collaborative writings were probably interrupted when Elizabeth moved to Ashridge to live with her husband, John Egerton. Frances and Jane would eventually follow Elizabeth to Ashridge for a brief interval because of the relative stability that it offered in contrast to their own besieged home. In 1654, Jane married Charles Cheyne (who would later become Viscount Newhaven). Jane and Charles had three children: Elizabeth (born 1656), William (born 1657), and Catherine (born 1658). Even as the Civil War continued, Jane and her husband found themselves able to enjoy a degree of comfort. Charles even managed to buy the former royal palace and manor of Chelsea with his wife's dowry. Later years The Restoration brought some changes into Jane's world, a major one being the return of her father to England with his second wife—Margaret Lucas Cavendish. Margaret was an unwelcome addition to the family, and Jane wrote several letters discussing the control Margaret was exercising over William's property and income with other members of the family. Some scholars have read the character of \\"Lady Tranquility\\" in Jane and Elizabeth's play The Concealed Fansyes as a satire of Margaret Lucas, but others consider this unlikely. While the fictional father's choice of an unsuitable fiancée may reflect some anxiety on his daughters' parts, there are few if any similarities to the real Margaret Lucas. Furthermore, the manuscript book which contains The Concealed Fansyes, another play and a variety of poems, was prepared as a presentation copy, a gift to William Cavendish from his daughters, intended for his pleasure and enjoyment. It seems likely that his daughters sought to emulate their playwright father, not offend him. In 1664, Jane met with an untimely loss. Her sister Elizabeth died in childbed, which prompted Jane to write an elegy on Elizabeth. It is difficult to know how much poetry Jane wrote during these later years. The elegy for Elizabeth is the only trace of it that has yet been discovered, but Nathan Comfort Starr and others have suggested that Jane continued to write poetry throughout her life. Regardless of whether or not she wrote poetry after leaving Welbeck in the 1650s, Jane did manage to leave her mark on the world in a highly public way: she used her own money to have Chelsea Church re-roofed in 1667. After her death in 1669 from a series of epileptic fits, Jane's impact on Chelsea was chronicled in a funeral sermon by Adam Littleton and an elegy by Thomas Lawrence. Both of these texts make mention of how Jane used her financial resources to benefit her community; the texts also imply that Jane's role as a literary author was not unknown to her friends and neighbours. First at Welbeck and later in the house she shared with her husband and in the community of Chelsea more broadly, Jane engaged in culture on her own terms. There continues to be much that we do not know about how her works were circulated, how she developed her own political networks, and what her status was in her community, but by examining her manuscript writings within the sophisticated (and continually evolving) frameworks for approaching manuscript culture that scholars like Margaret J. M. Ezell, Harold Love, and Heidi Brayman Hackel have recently developed, we can begin to disentangle some of the complexities surrounding this amazingly resilient, creative women's writings and her world.

A split decision is different from a majority decision. A majority decision occurs when two judges pick the same competitor as the winner, and the third judge scores the contest a draw (tie). The official result remains the same in both split and majority decisions, but the margin of victory is greater in a majority decision and less in a split decision. Occasionally, the judges' final decision is a tie, because the first judge scores for one competitor, the second one scores for the other competitor, and the third judge scores the contest a draw (tie); so in this case the official result is a split draw. Often, a split decision causes controversy due to its lack of unanimity. As a result, especially in high-profile or title fights, the victor may be encouraged or pressured to grant a rematch, in the hopes a return match-up will have a more decisive outcome. Notable fights On December 5, 1947, at the Yankee Stadium in Bronx, New York, Joe Louis defended his heavyweight title against Jersey Joe Walcott. During the bout Jersey Joe knocked down Louis twice in the first and fourth round and closed Louis' left eye. After 15 exciting rounds, Jersey Joe was confident he won the title. One judge favored Walcott, but two judges gave Louis the win, causing a chorus of boos at Yankee Stadium. After the bout Joe Louis said to Walcott \\"I'm sorry Joe (Walcott)\\". On February 15, 1978, at the Hilton Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, Muhammad Ali defended his Heavyweight championship against Leon Spinks. Before a national CBS Sports audience, Ali and Spinks went the distance for 15 rounds. One judge gave the bout to Ali (143–142) while two judges got 145–140 and 144–141 in favor of the new heavyweight champion Leon Spinks. It was the only time that Ali lost the title in the ring.

This butterfly is black with iridescent-blue hindwings. They are found in many different habitats, but are most commonly found in forests. Caterpillars are often black or red, and feed on compatible plants of the genus Aristolochia. They are known for sequestering acids from the plants they feed on in order to defend themselves from predators by being poisonous when consumed. The adults feed on the nectar of a variety of flowers. Some species of Aristolochia are toxic to the larvae, typically tropical varieties. While enthusiasts have led citizen efforts to conserve pipevine swallowtails in their neighborhoods on the West coast, the butterfly has not been the subject of a formal program in conservation or protected in legislation. The butterfly is however of \\"Special Concern\\" in Michigan, which is on the Northern limit of its range.  Nomenclature  The pipevine swallowtail was first identified in 1771 by Linnaues and originally was placed in the genus Papilo, as was typical for swallowtail butterflies. In 1777, it was moved to the genus Battus by Scopoli. The name Battus comes from the founder of the Greek colony of Cyrenaica, Battus I, and the species name philenor comes from the Greek word meaning ‘fond of husband’. The pipevine swallowtail also belongs to the tribe Troidini, a group of butterflies whose larvae all feed on plants of the genus Aristolochia. They are referred to as the Aristolochia butterflies. Distribution and habitat The pipevine swallowtail has a wide distribution across the Northern Americas. In the United States, the butterfly is found in New England down to Florida west to Nebraska, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California, and Oregon. There is also an isolated population in midland California. They have been observed as far south as Mexico and as far north as Ontario, although these sightings are inconsistent. The butterfly frequents warmer, more temperate environments, and can be found mostly in open grasslands, woodlands, meadows, and backyard gardens. They favor anywhere pipevine (Aristolochia) can grow in abundance.  Host plants and food resources  = Larvae = Pipevine swallowtail larvae feed on plants within the genus Aristolochia. These are commonly known as pipevine plants, which is where the butterfly gets its common name. This plant genus is known to have active aristolochic acids, which pipevine swallowtail larvae sequester and use for defensive properties. A common host plant is the Virginia snakeroot, (Aristolochia serpentaria), which can be found in the Eastern United States and in Florida. It has broad-leaved and narrow-leaved forms, and both act as hosts for swallowtail larvae. Other host plants include Pipevine (Aristolochia macrophylla), Woolly Dutchman’s pipe (Aristolochia tomentosa), Texas Dutchman’s pipe (Aristolochia reticulate), Watson's Dutchman’s pipe (Aristolochia watsonii), and California Dutchman’s pipe (Aristolochia californica). Some Aristolochia species are actually toxic or extremely distasteful to larvae and thus may act as death traps for the butterflies. This is especially true of exotic variants. = Adults = Pipevine swallowtail adults use nectar producing plants as hosts, and thus there are many plants that fit this criterion. These butterflies frequent thistle (Cirsium) flowers, the pink and purple flowers of the Phlox species, and ironweed of Vernonia species.  Life cycle  = Eggs = The eggs of the pipevine swallowtail vary in color from red to orange. They are small and are laid on host plant stems. A distinctive feature of these eggs which is shared by all Aristolochia butterflies is that the outer layer of the egg is covered by a firm and nourishing excretion laid in vertical stripes along the outside. The egg appears bumpy due to the excretion forming large beads along the bands. The female pipevine swallowtail deposits this excretion from a gland above the ovipositor during the egg laying process. These butterflies lay their eggs on the leaves of host plants in clusters with access to sunlight. The larvae hatch after a few weeks and immediately eat the remnants of the egg from which they emerged. = Larvae = Pipevine swallowtail larvae are around 5 cm in length and vary in color from dark brown to black. In areas of higher temperature such as Texas and Arizona, a red coloring dominates. Larvae have bright orange spots on the ends of tubercles in rows along their body, and at either end of the body the tubercles are elongated into filaments. Full grown larvae have a glossy or velvet appearance due to many fine hairs. Larvae sex determination can be done by looking at pits along the ventral surface at the ends of the abdominal sections. Larvae spend almost all their time eating the leaves of their host plants. Once they completely remove edible matter from one plant they move to the next one. They eat in groups at first but as food sources deplete they become more solitary as they move on in search of fresh host plants. Larvae filaments help them identify vertical plants, which are then determined to be host or non-host by using their mouthparts. The larvae feed and wander for several weeks before finding an isolated spot to pupate. = Pupae = The pipevine swallowtail pupae are colored green or brown. They are about 6 to 7 cm in length. These pupae differ from other swallowtail butterfly pupae in that the sides of their pupae bodies widen into a sort of a winged appearance, with distinctive purplish edges along the sides of these extensions. Pipevine swallowtail pupation takes place many feet off the ground on tree trunks or other suitable spots. Pupation is rare on green surfaces. Pupation begins when the larva releases silk to form a support structure so that the chrysalis can hang safely. In colder climates, it will spend the winter as a pupa, but in warmer climates, pupation only lasts a few weeks. Prior to emerging as an adult, the wing markings of the butterfly can be seen through the chrysalis. = Adults = Pipevine swallowtail adults have a wingspan from 7 to 13 cm. The dorsal wings of an adult male are black with vibrant blue iridescence on the hind wings. Female iridescence is duller in appearance. Bright orange spots are visible on the back end of the ventral wings. The adults from Californian populations of these butterflies have smaller and hairier bodies and are thought to be a subspecies Battus philenor hirsute. The adult pipevine swallowtail male spends most of its time feeding and searching for mates. Males have also been observed to take moisture and nutrients from mud, a behavior that is motivated by the presence of other males. Females spend their time feeding, being courted by males, and reproducing. Immediately after emerging from the chrysalis, adult butterflies spend time near the pupa case and dry their wings and remove pupal waste products from their bodies. The butterflies are seen during the spring and summer months.

Once found, males spend a long time hovering above the female, and courtship occurs as the male fans the female with pheromones from above. The males’ iridescent hind wings are also believed to be involved in attracting females. Males may also use sodium taken up from mud as a nuptial gift during mating. = Oviposition = Females identify host plants on which to lay their eggs by leaf shape, which can lead to mistakes in egg laying and thus compromising the eggs' survival rates. Aristolochic acid presence may also act as an oviposition chemical stimulant.  Natural enemies  The pipevine swallowtail larva has few natural predators but there have been observed cases of other butterfly larvae feeding on swallowtail larva. Parasites can also threaten larvae, with certain fly and wasp species being the most dangerous. Birds are the greatest threat to larvae, as many species will eat them whenever they can. As a result of bird predation, this butterfly has evolved a chemical defense using the aristolochic acids found in their host plants.  Defense  All host plants for the pipevine swallowtail have some form of aristolochic acids, which the larva sequesters while they feed. These acids are passed on to future eggs, pupa, and adult butterflies, so over generations, the level of acid in the body of the butterflies rises as the acid accumulates. High levels of acid make the larvae and adults unpalatable to bird predation. The bright orange spots present on larvae and adult butterflies are thought to serve as warnings to predators, alerting them to the potential bad taste, should the predator decide to make a meal out of the swallowtail.  Mimicry  As a result of the pipevine swallowtails' natural defense through acid sequestering, many other species of butterflies, like the Red-spotted purple butterfly (Limenitis arthemis ), Female eastern tiger swallowtail butterflies ( Papilio glaucus ) , female eastern black swallowtail butterflies ( Papilio polyxenes ), promothea silkmoth males (Callosamia promethea) and the spicebush swallowtail (Papilio troilus) use the swallowtail as a template for mimicry. Several other swallowtails subspecies have similar coloring to the pipevine swallowtail so that predators may also associate them with distaste. This is called Batesian mimicry. Pipevine swallowtails may also be involved with Müllerian mimicry, in which two distasteful species resemble each other, and thus act as a mimic and model; certain millipede species look like pipevine larvae and release hydrogen cyanide when in danger.

(October 1, 1935July 25, 2013) was an American artist, sculptor, illustrator and composer, who lived and worked in New York City. Walter de Maria's artistic practice is connected with Minimal art, Conceptual art, and Land art of the 1960s. LACMA director Michael Govan said, \\"I think he's one of the greatest artists of our time.\\" Govan, who worked with De Maria for a number of years, found De Maria's work \\"singular, sublime and direct\\". Life and career De Maria was born in 1935 in Albany, California. His parents were the proprietors of a local restaurant in Albany. Walter De Maria's first academic interest was music—first piano, then percussion. He also took to sports and cars, of which he made drawings. By 1946 he had joined a musicians' union. De Maria studied history and art at the University of California, Berkeley from 1953 to 1959. Trained as a painter, he soon turned to sculpture and began using other media. In the 1960s, De Maria and his friend, the avant-garde composer La Monte Young, participated in happenings and theatrical productions in the San Francisco area. From his exposure to the work of La Monte Young and dancer Simone Forti, among others, De Maria developed an interest in task- oriented, game-like projects that resulted in viewer-interactive sculptures. For example, his Boxes for Meaningless Work (1961) is inscribed with the instructions, \\"Transfer things from one box to the next box back and forth, back and forth, etc. Be aware that what you are doing is meaningless.\\"Walter De Maria's Works at the Guggenheim Museum Guggenheim Collection.Kristine Stiles & Peter Selz, Theories and Documents of Contemporary Art: A Sourcebook of Artists' Writings (Second Edition, Revised and Expanded by Kristine Stiles) University of California Press 2012, pp. 629-633 In 1960, De Maria moved to New York City where he married his wife Susanne Wilson (later Susanna) one year later.Tess Vigeland (March 23, 2011), A Homeowner With No Savings, but Some Options New York Times.Oral history interview with Walter De Maria, 1972 Oct. 4 Archives of American Art. His early sculptures from the 1960s were influenced by Dada, suprematism and constructivism. This influence led De Maria into using simple geometric shapes and industrially manufactured materials such as stainless steel and aluminium – materials which are also characteristic of Minimal art. With the support of collector Robert C. Scull, De Maria started making pieces in metal in 1965. Also in the mid-1960s, he became involved in various artistic activities. His piece, Cage, for John Cage, was included in the seminal 1966 Primary Structures exhibit at the Jewish Museum in New York. He appeared in happenings, composed two musical works (Cricket Music, 1964; Ocean Music, 1968), and produced two films (Three Circles and Two Lines in the Desert; Hardcore, both 1969). De Maria briefly ran a gallery on Great Jones Street in lower Manhattan with his wife Susanna, showing Joseph Cornell's collection of rare films, Robert Whitman's Happenings (he was then married to and created with dancer/artist Simone Forti), and exhibiting De Maria's Minimalist sculptures made of wood. In 1965 De Maria became the drummer in the New York-based rock group the Primitives and an artist/musician collaborative group called The Druds. The Primitives included Lou Reed and John Cale and was a precursor to The Velvet Underground.Dave Thompson, Your Pretty Face Is Going to Hell: The Dangerous Glitter of David Bowie, Iggy Pop, and Lou Reed (Backbeat Books, 2009), p. 5. In 1980, De Maria bought a four-story, 16,400-square-foot Con Edison substation at 421 East Sixth Street, and an adjacent lot at No. 419, between First Avenue and Avenue A.Robin Finn (January 31, 2014), Walter De Maria’s Grand and Gritty Home New York Times. In February 2014, this property was selling for $25 million. Businessman and art collector Peter Brant purchased De Maria's studio for $27 million. Brant's plans for the space were unknown.Nate Freeman (August 12, 2014), Peter Brant Purchases Walter De Maria's Massive Home Studio for Reasons that Remain to be Seen New York Observer. De Maria went to California in May 2013 to celebrate his mother's 100th birthday and had a stroke there a few days later. He remained there for treatment. He died in Los Angeles on July 25, 2013, at the age of 77. He is survived by his mother, Christine De Maria; his brother, Terry; four nieces; four nephews; and four grandnieces and two great grand nieces. Installations From 1968 De Maria produced Minimalist sculptures and installations such as the Munich Erdraum of 1968. He realized Land art projects in the deserts of the south-west US, with the aim of creating situations where the landscape and nature, light and weather would become an intense, physical and psychic experience. In his work, De Maria stressed that the work of art is intended to make the viewer think about the earth and its relationship to the universe. The Lightning Field (1977) is De Maria's best-known work. It consists of 400 stainless steel posts arranged in a calculated grid over an area of 1 mile × 1 km. The time of day and weather change the optical effects. It also lights up during thunder storms.Hurd, P (ed.) 2000, The Prestel Dictionary of Art and Artists in the 20th Century, Prestel Verlag, Munich.Mccord, R. \\"The Lightning Field. Santa Fe Always Online. The field is commissioned and maintained by Dia Art Foundation. It has been speculated that The Lightning Field influenced the imagery of author Cormac McCarthy's epilogue in his 1985 novel, Blood Meridian. In the 1960s and 1970s, De Maria created enduring urban works. As complementary pieces, Vertical Earth Kilometer (1977), and The Broken Kilometer (1979), address the idea of unseen or abstracted distance. Vertical Earth Kilometer is a one- kilometer-long brass rod, two inches in diameter, drilled into Friedrichsplatz Park in central Kassel, Germany. The rod's circular top, flush to the earth's surface, is framed by a two-meter square plate of red sandstone.Walter De Maria: Trilogies, September 16, 2011– January 8, 2012 Menil Collection, Houston. In 1979, De Maria meticulously arranged five hundred brass rods for The Broken Kilometer, a permanent installation at 393 West Broadway in New York. In contrast to the hard metal of both Kilometer pieces, the third of these urban works, The New York Earth Room (1977), is a 3,600-square-foot room filled to a depth of 22 inches with 250 cubic yards of earth (the New York work is a permanent iteration of Munich Earth Room, 1968, a temporary installation in Munich). Also in 1977, the artist recreated the work at the Heiner Friedrich Gallery in New York, which was then permanently reinstalled in 1980 at 141 Wooster Street, New York. The Broken Kilometer is also part of De Maria's series of monumental sculptures using a horizontal format, which feature groupings of elements ordered according to precise calculations. This series includes 360°/I-Ching (1981), A Computer Which Will Solve Every Problem in the World/3-12 Polygon (1984), 13, 14, 15 Meter Rows (1985), Apollo's Ecstasy (1990), and The 2000 Sculpture (1992). In 1989 De Maria completed a sphere of polished granite for the Assemblée Nationale in Paris,Le Guide de la visite du Palais Bourbon et de l'Hôtel de Lassay: La Cour d'Honneur Assemblée Nationale. followed in 2000 and 2004 by works for two museums on Naoshima Island in Japan, the Naoshima Contemporary Art Museum and the Chichu Art Museum. A comparable, 25-ton sculpture entitled Large Red Sphere (2002) was installed in the Türkentor, Munich, in 2010.Walter De Maria at Türkentor Bayerische Staatsgemäldesammlungen, Munich. One Sun/34 Moons (2002), conceived by the artist in collaboration with architect Steven Holl, was opened 2007 at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City. In 2010, The 2000 Sculpture (1992) was the first work of art to inaugurate the Resnick Pavilion at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Exhibitions De Maria and Robert Whitman opened the 9 Great Jones Street gallery in New York in 1963; the same year, De Maria's first solo show of sculpture was presented there. He had his first solo exhibition in a commercial gallery in 1965, at the Paula Johnson Gallery on New York's Upper East Side. (Its owner soon became better known with the Paula Cooper Gallery) De Maria avoided participating in museum shows when he could, preferring to create his installations outdoors or at unconventional urban locations.David Ng (July 26, 2013), Walter De Maria, celebrated sculptor, dies at 77 Los Angeles Times. His work was more widely shown outside the United States, and he had major exhibitions in Japan and Europe. In 1968 and 1977, De Maria participated in Documenta in Kassel; he installed his permanent public sculpture Vertical Earth Kilometer in the city's Friedrichsplatz Park. In 1977, a major exhibition of De Maria's sculpture was held at the Kunstmuseum Basel in 1972. He has also since been the subject of numerous solo exhibitions organized by Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris (1981), Museum Boymans-van Beuningen in Rotterdam (1984), Staatsgalerie in Stuttgart (1987), Moderna Museet in Stockholm (1988), Gemäldegalerie in Berlin (1998), and Chichu Art Museum in Naoshima (2000 and 2004).Biography: Walter de Maria Guggenheim Collection Organized by the Menil Collection in 2011, \\"Walter De Maria: Trilogies\\" was the artist's first major museum exhibition in the United States.

In appearance, it is intermediate between the house sparrow, and the Spanish sparrow, a species of the Mediterranean and Central Asia closely related to the house sparrow. The Italian sparrow occurs in northern Italy and neighbouring regions, with intermediates with the house sparrow in a very narrow contact zone in the Alps, a slow gradation in appearance from the Italian to Spanish sparrows across central and southern Italy, and more birds of intermediate appearance in Malta, Crete, and other parts of the Mediterranean. There has been much debate on the origins and taxonomic status of the Italian sparrow, especially given its possible hybrid origin. Some have classified it as a subspecies of house sparrow, a subspecies of the Spanish sparrow, or as a distinct species, a treatment followed if only for convenience by authorities such as the Handbook of the Birds of the World. A DNA analysis by Glenn-Peter Sætre and colleagues published in 2011 indicated an origin of the Italian sparrow through hybridisation between the Spanish and house sparrows, and Sætre and colleagues argued that given its origins and the limited extent of hybridisation, the treatment as a distinct species was supported.  Description  The Italian sparrow is a small chunky bird, with grey and brown plumage. The sexes differ in their plumage pattern, and slightly in length. The male has a head patterned like that of the Spanish sparrow, with a chestnut crown, nape and sides of head, and white cheeks. The male's upperparts are bright chestnut, and its underparts are pale grey, lacking the black streaking of the Spanish sparrow. The male has a black patch on its throat and chest, known as a bib or badge. This patch, like much of the male's plumage is dull in fresh non-breeding plumage and is brightened by wear and preening. The female is nearly identical to the female house sparrow, but it differs from the female Spanish sparrow in its lack of black streaks on the underparts. Albinism is occasionally recorded. The Italian sparrow is about the same size as the house sparrow at in length. The tail is , the tarsus , and wing lengths for males are . The Italian sparrow's weight varies seasonally from in the winter to in the summer. The vocalisations of the Italian sparrow are similar to those of both the Spanish sparrow and the house sparrow. Its vocalisations carry better in natural environments than those of the house sparrow. The male gives a chreep call like that of the Spanish sparrow to proclaim nest ownership, and a faster version of this as part of courtship display. Male song patterns grade slowly into those of the Spanish sparrow across southern Italy, but in the area of overlap between the house and Italian sparrows, the two birds sound alike.  Taxonomy  The taxonomic status of the Italian sparrow has been a matter of debate. It has been variously regarded as a stable hybrid between the house sparrow and Spanish sparrow, or as a subspecies of either the house or Spanish sparrow. Many authorities, including the Handbook of the Birds of the World, recognise it as a separate species, if only for convenience. Others, including many conservation groups, consider the Italian sparrow a simple hybrid and ignore it. The chromosomes of Italian sparrows are distinct from those of the house sparrow, but mitochondrial DNA suggest a close relation to the house sparrow. A DNA analysis by Jo Hermansen, Glenn-Peter Sætre, and a group of other scientists from Norway published in Molecular Ecology in 2011 indicates that the Italian sparrow originated as a hybrid between house and Spanish sparrows. It has mitochondrial DNA from both parent species. Additionally, it is now breeding beside the Spanish sparrow without cross-breeding in areas where the species both occur. Although it hybridises with the house sparrow in a sparsely populated contact zone in the Alps, the contact zone is characterized by relatively abrupt changes in species-specific male plumage, suggesting that partial reproductive isolation based on plumage may also have developed between these two taxa. As a genetically distinct group that is reproductively isolated from the parental species, it must be recognised as a separate species, according to Hermansen and colleagues.  Distribution and habitat  Female in Tuscany The Italian sparrow is found in northern and central Italy, Corsica, and small parts of France, Switzerland, Austria, and Slovenia. Its distribution was described by Italian zoologist Enrico Hillyer Giglioli in 1881 as professing \\"'Conservative opinions'; for it keeps strictly within our current political frontiers\\". At the northernmost edge of its range in the southern Alps, there is a narrow hybrid zone about 20–30 km (12–20 mi) wide with the house sparrow. In southern Italy, there is a gradual clinal trend with the Spanish sparrow, with birds increasing in their similarity to the Spanish sparrow in appearance and ecology further south, from around Naples to western Sicily, where birds resemble pure Spanish sparrows. However, this trend may be superficial, and the Handbook of the Birds of the World recognises birds from Sicily and Crete as Italian sparrows. Male in Crete Sardinia is occupied by Spanish sparrows, while sparrows on Malta, Crete, and the adjacent islands are intermediates similar to the Italian sparrow. On Malta, sparrows resemble the Spanish sparrow, with urban birds behaving much like the house sparrow, and rural birds like the Spanish sparrow. The situation is complicated by house and Spanish sparrows which winter and migrate on Malta. A more complex situation occurs in parts of northern Africa, where a highly variable mixed, interbreeding population of house sparrows and Spanish sparrows occurs. This \\"hybrid swarm\\" shows a full range of characters from nearly pure house sparrows to nearly pure Spanish sparrows and everything between. The Italian sparrow is associated with human habitations, inhabiting towns, cities, and agricultural areas. In most cities in Italy, it shares the urban environment with the Eurasian tree sparrow, and in some parts of Naples, it is replaced entirely by this species. The Italian sparrow's breeding population is believed to comprise 5 to 10 million pairs, 750,000 to 900,000 of which are estimated to live in urban areas. It has a population density of 58 to 160 pairs per square kilometer. Up to the mid-1990s, its population increased steadily, probably due to increased urbanisation. Between 2000 and 2005, the Italian sparrow's population in Italy declined by 27.1 percent, mirroring the declines of the house sparrow throughout Europe. From 1998 to 2008, urban populations declined by about 50 percent. A study of the Italian sparrow's status listed a large number of potential causes for the Italian sparrow's decline, including shortages of insect food, agricultural intensification, and reductions of green areas. The Italian sparrow is among the most common birds in Italian cities, but other species, including the European goldfinch, are more common.  Behaviour  Eggs from the collection of the Muséum de Toulouse A fresco at Pompeii depicting an Italian sparrow or a relative The Italian sparrow's behaviour is similar in many ways to that of the house sparrow. It is a social bird, which feeds mostly on seeds and insects. It is mostly sedentary, but it wanders to some extent outside its breeding season. These wanderings are mostly local, but they may extend into southern France. Similarly, the house sparrow sometimes occurs as a winter visitor in northern Italy. Besides intergrading with the Spanish and house sparrows, the Italian sparrow has been recorded hybridising with the Eurasian tree sparrow. The eggs of the Italian sparrow do not seem to differ from those of the house sparrow. Broods may contain two to eight eggs, with an average of about 5.2.  Relationships with humans  In most of its range, the Italian sparrow is an abundant and familiar bird of houses. It has been one of the wild birds most commonly consumed as food in Italy. Portrayals of the Italian sparrow or one of its relatives have been found at Pompeii. Like the house sparrow, the Italian sparrow is considered a biological indicator of pollution.

He was one of Sydney's most famous and well-loved personalities and made a significant impact on the social and political scene of Sydney at a time of strong anti-Chinese sentiment in Australia. In Australia, he is usually referred to by his given name, Quong Tart, or by a shortened nickname, Quong. Public life Portrait of Quong Tart, ca. 1880s, State Library of NSW A prominent businessman, he owned a network of tearooms in the Sydney Arcade, the Royal Arcade and King Street. His crowning success was the ‘Elite Hall’ in the Queen Victoria Market, now the Queen Victoria Building. He was also a community leader, well connected with the local political and social elites. The Imperial government of China awarded him the status of a Mandarin of the fifth degree, Ji Fa (磯法)（2015），專題: 澳洲第一位華裔公民梅光達 (Feature: Australia's first Chinese citizen Mei Quong Tart)，CCHC Herald Australian edition (《號角》澳洲版) with blue feather, in 1887, in acknowledgment of his service to the Overseas Chinese community and to European-Chinese relations in AustraliaChinese-Australian Historical Images in Australia: Tart, Quong (1850 - 1903) and for assisting with the 1887 Chinese mission to Australia sponsored by Zhang Zhidong, which was the first official Chinese mission to visit Australia. In 1894, he was advanced to the fourth degree by the Emperor personally and was appointed Mandarin of the Blue Button, honoured by the Dragon Throne with the Peacock Feather. Quong Tart's parents and grandparents were also granted titles at the same time. An active philanthropist, he often provided dinners, gifts and entertainment at his own expense for recipients ranging from the Benevolent Society home at Liverpool to the newsboys of Ashfield, Summer Hill, Croydon and Burwood. From 1885 to 1888, he provided a series of dinners for the inmates of destitute asylums. He also had progressive ideas about Sydney social politics. His tea rooms were the site of the first meetings of Sydney's suffragettes, and he devised new and improved employment policies for staff, such as paid sick leave. He was a spokesman for the Chinese community, often advocating for the rights of Chinese-Australians and working as an interpreter. He was one of the founders of the first Chinese merchants association in Sydney, titled the Lin Yik Tong. In 1888, he co-signed a petition to Zhang Zhidong requesting that the Chinese government set up a consulate in Australia. In 1889, he sent a petition in his own name requesting the same, and also that the Chinese government raise the issue of maltreatment of Chinese residents in Australia with the British government. He campaigned against the opium trade, and in 1883 went on an investigation to the Chinese camps in Southern New South Wales. The report revealed widespread opium addiction, and on 24 April 1884, Quong Tart presented a petition to the colonial secretary requesting the ban of opium imports. In June that year Quong Tart also tried to win support for a ban of opium in Melbourne and Ballarat, Victoria. In 1887, he presented a second petition to parliament, and produced a pamphlet titled A Plea for the Abolition of the Importation of Opium. He was also part of the NSW Royal Commission on Alleged Chinese Gambling and Immorality and Charges of Bribery Against Members of the Police Force from 1891 to 1892. Early life Mei Quong Tart was born in 1850 in the village of ShandiShan Dai, Roots Village database (), Duanfen () in southern Taishan, Guangdong province, China.Chinese Australian Historical Society biography 梅光达和他的中国情结(图) His father, named Mei Kuoyuan, was a fairly successful merchant dealing in ornamental wares. Quong Tart immigrated to Australia in 1859 with his uncle, transporting a shipload of miners to the goldfields around Araluen and Braidwood in regional New South Wales. Once in Braidwood, Quong Tart lived at Bell's Creek in the store of Scottish Thomas Forsyth. In the following years, he was taken in by the wealthy family of Robert Percy Simpson, whose wife Alice Simpson, née Want, was charmed by his Scottish accent. Under the Simpsons, Quong Tart learnt to behave as a proper English gentleman and converted to Christianity. Aged just 21, Quong Tart built a cottage at Bell's Creek with a small fortune developed from investing in gold claims and was prominent in sporting, cultural and religious affairs. On 11 July 1871 he became a naturalised British subject, joined the Freemasons in 1885, and in 1877 he was appointed to the board of the Bell's Creek public school. In 1881 he returned to Taishan, China at the request of his family, and visited Canton and Nanking to set up operations for a tea trade to Sydney.追寻梅光达足迹 (\\"Tracing Mei Quong Tart's footsteps\\"), 台山僑網（Taishan Overseas Chinese Office） On returning to Sydney, he established a chain of silk stores and tea shops. The tea shops were intended to provide customers with samples of tea, but became so successful that he turned his shops into tea rooms, the first tea rooms in Sydney. In February 1882 he applied for a trademark with which to market his tea. On 30 August 1886 he married a young English school teacher, Margaret Scarlett. Her family, although friends with Tart's, did not approve of the union and her father refused to attend the wedding. In 1888, Quong Tart and Margaret visited China with their daughter. In Canton, Quong Tart met with Zhang Zhidong, Viceroy of Liangguang, the man who had granted Quong Tart his honours of a mandarin of the fifth degree the previous year. Quong Tart reported to Zhang the anti- Chinese sentiments in Australia and urged the Imperial government to raise the matter with the British government. Tea rooms Bon voyage letter from employees (20 April 1894) In December 1889, Quong Tart opened the Loong Shan Tea House\\"Loong Shan Tea House\\", Evening News (Sydney), 23 December 1889, p.2 at 137 King Street, Sydney. It was his grandest tea room, with marble fountains and ponds with golden carp. The tea and grill rooms occupied the ground floor, while on the first floor there was a reading room. It soon became one of Sydney's most important meeting places. The site is now part of the Glasshouse shopping complex, home to the Tea Centre. With construction of the Queen Victoria Market building being completed in 1898, Quong Tart saw it as an opportunity to expand his business and set up a tea room with additional cloak and smoke room. Quong Tart's Elite Hall in the Queen Victoria Market Building was formally opened by the Mayor of Sydney, Matthew Harris, in 1898. The tea rooms were on the ground floor near the centre of the markets, fronting George Street. A plush-carpeted staircase led to the function hall on the first floor. The Elite Hall had capacity for nearly 500 people and included a stage with an elaborately carved proscenium. At the other end was the Elite Dining Saloon, described as having ‘elegant appointments’. His teahouses were popular with high society and VIPs, with members of the 1891 Federation Convention dining at the Elite Hall. Quong Tart's tea rooms were also located at 777 George St, in Moore Park Zoo, and in the Haymarket theatre district. They were the site of Sydney's first suffragette meetings, and between 1885 and 1888, were home to functions for inmates of destitute asylums. As part of his employment program, he devised new policies for his employees, including sick leave, holiday pay and time off for personal reasons. Personal life Quong Tart had two sons and four daughters, whom, although Anglican himself, he baptised in different denominations to avoid charges of prejudice. Quong Tart and his family lived in his mansion, 'Gallop House', in the Sydney suburb of Ashfield, while his four daughters attended the nearby Presbyterian Ladies' College at Croydon, the first Asian students to attend the school. He was well known as a uniquely Victorian character, being a Chinese Australian who adopted the dress and manners of an English gentleman, all while performing Scottish songs on his bagpipe. He is distinguished as the first Chinese person in Australia to be initiated into the Society of Freemasons. Quong Tart was \\"as well known as the Governor himself\\" and \\"quite as popular among all classes\\" in NSW. Death Bust of Quong Tart near Ashfield railway station On 19 August 1902, Quong Tart was brutally bashed with an iron bar and robbed of a few pounds at his office in the Queen Victoria Building, a crime that shocked Sydney. The attacker, Frederick Duggan, described as a \\"dim-witted thug\\", was jailed for 12 years, a light sentence for a crime that police believed was a simple robbery gone wrong. After the attack Quong Tart never fully recovered, and he died from pleurisy at his Ashfield home 11 months later, on 26 July 1903, aged 53. His funeral, held on 28 July 1903 featured the \\"who's who\\" of Sydney, and was widely covered in the newspapers. Two hundred men escorted the coffin from his Ashfield mansion to a train which transported the funeral party to Rookwood Cemetery. There, thousands of Sydneysiders gathered to pay their last respects. Quong Tart was dressed in his ceremonial robes of a Mandarin of the Blue Button, under his masonic apron. Many believe that his attack and consequential death was more than a burglary mishap. Letters from his Chinese friends indicate that many of them had suspicions about Quong Tart's death, believing that it could have been arranged by \\"the Western people\\" or by other jealous Chinese businessmen. As a commemoration, in 1998 a statue was erected for him in Ashfield. He was survived by his wife, two sons, and four daughters. Centenary celebrations To mark the centenary since Quong Tart's passing, a 12-month celebration was held in venues throughout Sydney. During July and August 2004, an exhibition was held in the Queen Victoria Building titled, \\"No Ordinary Man. Sydney's Quong Tart: citizen, merchant & philanthropist\\". Curated by Dr Nicola Teffer, it featured information and photographs documenting Quong Tart's busy life in China and Australia and was coordinated by the Quong Tart Commemoration Committee. A 32-page illustrated catalogue was also made available. The Powerhouse Museum also held a three-day international conference at the start of July, \\"Quong Tart and his time, 1850–1903\\" which featured a multimedia performance held at the University of Technology, called \\"Tales of a Tartan Mandarin – The Story of Quong Tart\\". The QVB Tearoom and the Tea Centre on King Street also arranged a special menu item of \\"quong tarts\\", a unique fruit tart, to celebrate their historical link with Mei Quong Tart.

Born in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1796, Belches joined the Royal Navy on 2 February 1812. In March 1814, whilst serving on board , he was injured in a friendly-fire battle with . He was an officer on in December 1826, when it was anchored in Sydney Harbour along with under Sir James Brisbane and under Sir James Stirling. When Brisbane died on 19 December, Stirling made a number of promotions and re-appointments to cover for his loss. In the process, Belches was promoted to Third Lieutenant on the Success in April 1827. In March 1827, the Success arrived off the coast of the Swan River in what is now Western Australia to undertake an exploration expedition which aimed to determine the suitability of the area for establishing a British colony. After examining the coastal waters of the area, an 18-man land party was formed to explore up the river. As a member of the party, Belches traversed the Swan up to its junction with Ellen Brook. At the location now known as The Narrows, Stirling named a peninsula on the southern side of the Swan River Point Belches in Belches' honour. At the junction of Ellen Brook, Stirling split the party into three groups, sending Belches and George Heathcote to explore to the north, where they found a fresh water lake. After returning to the junction of the Canning River, Stirling sent Belches to explore it. Belches traced the Canning for twenty miles (or 32 kilometres), returning after two days to report that it was a fresh water river \\"similar in every respect\\" to the Swan. After returning to the ship, the crew sailed north for a distance, then southwards to Cape Geographe, when Belches reported finding \\"a source large enough to be called a River, gushing from the side of the Solid Limestone Rock and rushing to the Sea half a mile distant with a considerable noise.\\" A Swan River Colony was formed in 1829, and by the end of 1831 had expanded to become the British settlement of Western Australia. In 1834, Belches emigrated to the colony on the James Patterson. He took up land at Albany, where there was already a large Scottish community. He served as Albany's harbour master from 1834 until 1837. In 1840, he entered into a land partnership with George Cheyne, and in 1852, the pair prospected for gold together in the Stirling Range. Belches left the colony in 1858, retired in 1864, attained the rank of commander on 20 May 1877 and died in 1890.

Dog crates are designed to replicate a dog's natural den and as such can provide them with a place of refuge at home or when traveling to new surroundings. Other common reasons for using a dog crate are for toilet training a new puppy, transporting a dog, limiting access while the dog learns rules, ensuring the dog's safety, confining a dog in locations where dogs cannot safely or legally roam freely, or giving a dog a place to go when visitors come to the house. Crate training accustoms the dog to the crate so that they can rest in it without stress. Using a crate for a dog is similar to having a playpen for a toddler or a crib for a baby, and allows the owner to take their eyes off their pet. However, misuse (such as prolonged locking) can cause the dog psychological harm. https://www.labradortraininghq.com/labrador-training/why-use-a-dog-crate-is- it-cruel/ Types of dog crates There are many types of dog crates, and variations within the types. Factors to consider when choosing an appropriate crate include cost, durability, portability, safety, and style. Monday, 4 November 2019 *Solid plastic crates are usually more suitable than other types for secure travel, such as in an airplane. They might also be safer in a car accident than wire crates. Disadvantages are that they take up a lot of space and do not fold for storage. *Travel crates such as the Gunner Kennels and the Variocage are designed specifically for use in vehicles for pet vehicle transportation. Gunner Kennels is the only 5 Star Crash Test rated pet travel crate on the market, according to the Center For Pet Safety and its certification standards. Gunner Kennels crates can be used on airplanes, as well as in the home and for crate training. Variocages have special crumple zones designed to work with the crumple zones of the vehicles and absorb the impact of the accident and have been lab tested for safety. These crates are not intended for use on airplanes or for carrying pets outside of vehicles. They also do not make good housebreaking crates. *Aluminum crates can be either fixed or folding. A few of their advantages are: light weight, very strong when constructed with appropriate bracing, will not rust, excellent airflow and vision for the dogs. Aluminum crates are suitable for use at veterinary hospitals, car travel, as a permanent \\"den\\" for your dog inside the home and in breeding kennel environments. Some aluminum crates have solid walls and some have bars. The crates with bars may be more suitable for dogs who need to see out to feel comfortable. Other dogs may prefer the den like feel of the solid wall variety to feel secure. *Wire crates usually can be folded for storage or transport, although it might be difficult to do and they are fairly heavy for their size. They provide more airflow for the dog and provide people with a clearer view inside and they range in size. Such crates are often used in car travel, at veterinary hospitals, and at kennels. There are a variety of covers and pads available to make crates safe and more comfortable. :Wire crates are also popular at dog shows; they allow the dog to be clearly seen by spectators, and sashes, rosettes, and ribbons won can be hung on the crate for display. *Hybrid crates such as Diggs Revol crates are a combination of aluminum, coated steel wire mesh and reinforced plastic. These crates have the durability of traditional aluminum crates and the airflow and clear view of the dog, that wire crates offer. Diggs Revol crate also has a unique, one-hand collapsible feature, making the crate easy to set up, break down and store. Diggs Revol Crate has won Pet Business's award for Best Dog Containment in both 2018 and 2019, as well as Good Design award in 2018. Some additional features are rounded edges that prevent injuries to dogs and humans that are common with wire crates and an ergonomic handle, that makes the crate easier to open (especially for those with limited hand mobility, like the elderly and autistic). *Soft-sided crates (fabric on a metal frame) can be easily folded for storage or transport and are lightweight. They provide the dog with a stronger sense of security but still allow visibility and airflow. They cannot be used with dogs who are likely to dig or chew at the crate, and they are unsuitable for transporting dogs in vehicles. *Dog tents are an alternative to soft crates. They offer many of the same advantages (and disadvantages) of soft crates but fold down to an even smaller size and are ultra lightweight so that they can be stuffed into tent bags and taken virtually anywhere. They are good enclosures for dog owners who need to pack their soft crates into cramped vehicles or suitcases or for people who hike, camp, or are involved in dog sports. Like soft crates, they are not suitable for dogs who are not housebroken, or for vehicle travel. *Decorative crates, made of finished wood, rattan, or other custom materials designed to match a home's decor, aren't usually good for transportation and are not good for destructive dogs, but fulfill a need for confinement at home.

It was first published in 1932 by William Heinemann and in the US by William Morrow. In 1936 it was adapted as a film, The Lonely Road, released in the US the same year as Scotland Yard Commands, starring Clive Brook and Victoria Hopper. The novel also served as the basis for an episode (no 14) in the BBC series The Jazz Age in 1968. Plot summary The book begins with a note from the solicitor for Commander Malcolm Stevenson, who, we learn, has died recently (in about 1930), and we learn that this was written by him in the months before his death. Stevenson's narration begins with a series of seemingly unrelated vignettes, of which the only one that is readily sensible occurred during World War I, leading the last survivors of a sinking decoy ship, Stevenson managed to sink a German submarine, and with the British survivors wounded and with no way of taking prisoners, killed the Germans as they attempted to surrender. That incident still haunts him. Quite wealthy, he runs a flotilla of coastal steamers in a desultory but increasingly profitable way. He awakens, after having been taken, injured, from a damaged car, on a night on which he has been drinking heavily. Still bearing the mental and physical scars of the naval encounter, he meets a dancer, Mary (Mollie) Gordon (whom he nicknames Sixpence), at a dance hall in Leeds, where she entertains lonely gentlemen by dancing with them, or sitting out a dance and talking, at sixpence a dance. He has the best evening he has had in years with Mollie. The police call in Stevenson to consult on guns they have found being smuggled into the United Kingdom, found near a burned-out lorry. Stevenson cannot identify the guns, but puts together something Mollie said, and something said by his cousin by marriage, pioneer aviator Sir Phillip Stenning, and realises Mollie's brother may well have been the driver of the lorry. He approaches the police. Rather than risk publicity from a police interrogation, they ask Stevenson to do the initial questioning himself. They tell Stevenson they are convinced the guns are being smuggled in for an armed uprising in connection with the upcoming General Election, although they have no idea who is responsible. Stevenson returns to Leeds, and approaches Mollie at her employment. Through artful questioning, he confirms she would be able to identify her brother's lorry. Torn between the desire to help the police, and his own growing affection for Mollie, he invites her down to his home in Devon for a platonic vacation. She agrees. The morning after their arrivals, he takes her to the police station in Newton Abbot, where the police await. Stevenson watches as through gentle, but deceitful questioning, they get her to identify the lorry. They lead her to believe her brother is dead. Stevenson's sense of fair play is outraged, and he takes Mollie away to consult with his solicitor. After consultation, she tells all to the police, but knows little of help. Stevenson and Mollie track down her brother, Billy, in Leicester. Stevenson and Billy recognise each other. Stevenson is realising that he did not crash his car that night, but that, drunk, he went for a walk on the beach and was assaulted by men there, and the car crash was faked. Billy confesses involvement, admitting that he has been paid to take packages from a ship being landed on the coast to a barn. Sometimes, he would convey people as well. He little cared what he conveyed so long as he got paid. After Billy meets with Stevenson's solicitor, he is taken to the police. He can identify the destination of the goods, but what the police want is to interrupt the landing, catching the ship and everyone involved. Sir Phillip warns that this is a dangerous enterprise, but Stevenson allows Billy and Mollie to participate, and offers the services of one of his ships to help intercept the smugglers. Billy is duly contacted by the smugglers for another run. As they prepare, Stevenson asks Mollie to marry him. She refuses him, until they have lived in the same house for a time and come to know each other better. As the police, Stevenson, and the others meet in his house, they are fired on. In seconds, Billy and one of the police are dead, and Mollie is wounded in the shoulder. Stevenson and Stenning go in pursuit of the gunmen, who try to escape by ship. Through expert ship handling and knowledge of the Channel tides, Stevenson manoeuvres the other ship into a position where she must run on to the rocks of \\"The Shackles\\" (probably his relocation of the genuine \\"Manacles\\" reef to a location off Dodman Point). Stevenson makes a token attempt to save the other vessel, but it fails (as Stevenson probably knows it would), and the ship sinks, killing the men aboard. Stevenson hurries to the hospital to see how Mollie is. Mollie's wounds have become infected, and despite Stevenson sparing no expense for her care, her condition slowly worsens. After a night in which Stevenson remains by her bedside, pouring out his heart to her and telling her of his plans for them, she dies. The gunmen's bodies are recovered, one Dutchman, one Russian (probably a Communist) and a recent Cambridge graduate. The embittered Stevenson tracks down the Cambridge man's contacts, and finds a female co- conspirator. They had smuggled guns and Communists into the country so that, at the proper moment, the plot could be exposed and blamed on the Labour Party, ensuring a Conservative victory. Stevenson, realising that the girl was present that night he was drunk and that she persuaded the others to spare his life, tells her of the deaths that have resulted from the actions, and leaves her to her conscience; first learning who was the brains of the conspiracy: a Cambridge political science don. First taking precautions to ensure the story would survive his death, Stevenson goes to confront the don. The professor denies nothing, but attempts to defend his actions by telling his view of what must follow a Labour victory. Stevenson, realising the don lives in an ivory tower, gives the don an ultimatum: The story will be in the press, assuring a thumping Labour victory in the election now only days away (and the professor's arrest), unless the professor kills himself by Friday, four days before the election. The professor does so, falling \\"accidentally\\" from a high window, and Stevenson has little sympathy when told about how the professor's sister will be devastated. Stevenson returns to his work on Monday, at least having assured that the election will not be influenced either way. He returns to his lonely road which he had shared with another for so brief a moment, and which will soon lead to his death.

It is generally accepted as the first major rock and roll concert. Background Alan Freed had joined WJW- Radio in 1951 as the host of a classical-music program, but he took up a different kind of music at the suggestion of Cleveland record-store owner Leo Mintz, who had noted with great interest the growing popularity, among young customers of all races, of rhythm-and-blues records by black musicians. Mintz decided to sponsor Freed's three hours of late-night programming. Once they saw the popularity of the program increase, they decided on holding a live dance event featuring some of the artists whose records were appearing on Freed’s show. Concert The concert was organized by Freed (a disc jockey and considered to have popularized the term \\"Rock and Roll\\" at WJW-Radio), along with Lew Platt, a local concert promoter, and Freed's sponsors, including Mintz, owner of the Record Rendezvous store. The concert featured Paul Williams and the Hucklebuckers, and Tiny Grimes and the Rocking Highlanders (an African American instrumental group that appeared in kilts). Also on the bill were the Dominoes, Varetta Dillard and Danny Cobb. The concert was held on March 21, 1952. More tickets were printed than the arena's actual capacity, in part due to counterfeiting and a printing error. With an estimated 20,000 individuals trying to crowd into an arena that held slightly more than half that — and worries that a riot might break out as people tried to crowd in — the fire authorities shut down the concert after the first song by opening act Paul \\"Hucklebuck\\" Williams ended. Freed made a public apology on WJW the next day,; he referred to the event as the \\"ball\\" or \\"dance,\\" not as a \\"concert.\\" Accounts in the contemporary Cleveland newspapers are at odds with lore that circulates today about the event, scheduled to begin at 10 p.m. “The frustrated gathered outside, unable to buy a ticket at $1.75, their number increasing until it amounted to about 6,000” as estimated by Cleveland Police captain William Zimmerman.“Moondog Ball is Halted as Crowds Crash Arena Gate.” Cleveland Plain Dealer, 22 March 1952. “About 9:30 they stormed the Arena, knocking down four panel doors, brushing police away and storming inside. Some two hours and 30 policemen later, Captain Zimmerman called it a night…. After ordering the ball ended, Capt. Zimmerman asked the crowd to leave. Police stood by as they slowly and reluctantly filed out.”Ibid. This indicates that the event was not halted after Paul Williams’ opening song, and that Cleveland’s police rather than fire department ended the Ball. Journalist Valena Williams’ first-person report also confirms that the musical performances lasted for some time: “Paul Williams and his Hucklebuckers left the stage and Tiny Grimes and his Highlanders took over. I thought the acoustics were poor because I couldn’t hear the music. But then I realized that the din was drowning out the orchestra. I looked back at the dance floor and more than three-quarters of it was filled so tightly that you couldn’t see anything of the floor itself.” Williams, Valena Minor. “Call & Post Women’s Editor Caught in Wild Melee as Moon Doggers ‘Break it Up’.” Cleveland Call and Post, 29 March 1952. Williams described sharing her concerns about the boisterous crowd with promoter Lewis Platt, who “laughed”; she noted that “[W]hen the Arena bar was ordered shut down at 10:30 I knew the crowd was disturbing police authority, too.”Ibid. The “Coronation Ball” aspect of the event referred to scheduled intermission festivities, as Williams explained: “When I got home I was not surprised to hear the live broadcast from the Arena cut off the air. I learned later the dance had at that time been stopped. The midnight coronation of the two most popular teenagers was never held.”Ibid. Williams’ eyewitness writeup includes her colorful descriptions of the youthful crowd, “most of them teensters.” Though Alan Freed is rightfully heralded for bringing black rhythm-and-blues to an integrated audience on Cleveland’s airwaves and elsewhere, the crowd at the Moondog Coronation Ball in Cleveland's Arena was notably different. Wiliams chronicled for posterity the racial makeup of the dance’s attendees: “less than one per cent of them were white.”Ibid. Contemporary revival Cleveland rock radio station WMMS (100.7 FM) attempted to stage a revival of the concert in 1986 under the name \\"Moondog Coronation Ball II\\"; then-program director John Gorman had intended for the event to serve as an oldies rock and roll tribute concert – part of the campaign to bring the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame to Cleveland. For legal reasons, the event never materialized. A few years later in 1992, Gorman, then at local oldies radio station WMJI (105.7 FM), successfully organized a 40th anniversary concert called \\"Moondog Coronation Ball '92\\". The concert has been held every year since, featuring oldies rock and roll acts, and sponsored by WMJI. In recent years, the event has been held at Quicken Loans Arena.

Most of these balconies are of the Viceroyalty period, built in the late 17th and 18th centuries, are located in the Historic Center of Lima. They were adapted for residential purposes and have influenced the lives of many Peruvian scholars such as the 19th century writer Ricardo Palma. The balconies have been crucial in UNESCO's declaration of the Historic Center of Lima as a World Heritage Site.  Colonial architecture  Peruvian colonial architecture in the Viceroyalty of Peru developed in the 16th to the 19th century, when Latin American was conquered by the Spaniards. Balconies in Lima were built in the Renaissance, Baroque, Neoclassical and Neo-Baroque styles and had Mediterranean, Moorish and Andalusian influences. The Renaissance and Baroque styles emerged as a result of European influence. The Renaissance idea that the nobility of a building characterized a city's grandiosity permeated in Lima's architecture. Baroque architecture of this period, characterized by exuberance and heavy ornamentation, is prevalent as well. In the 18th century, the Rococo style permeated in Lima, as a result of French influence. This style embraced ornamentation and playful themes. Casa Goyeneche, built in 1863, is noted for its French influence. The Moors also influenced Peruvian architecture. Closed wooden balconies, also called miradores, were inherited from the Mashrabiya tradition of Moorish architecture, as the Moors occupied Southern Spain. The term mirar in Spanish translates to “to look”, indicating that the balconies give the residents an extensive view of the scenery (Bloom and Blair). However, Moorish styles became less popular when modern styles were adopted in Lima. Office building with Balconies in Lima, this one in particular is Neo- Colonial.  Construction  The main features of the balconies are the lattice, still and baluster. The wooden balconies projecting at upper levels also allow for privacy and air circulation, an essential feature for buildings in warmer countries. Non-rounded balconies were introduced in Spain in the 18th century. Balconies of the 15th to the 17th century are noted for their openness, while balconies built after that period are more closed. Sevillan azulejos and mosaics are used in the construction of the balconies.  Social function  In the 18th century, viceroys would stand on the balconies to address the colonists. In churches, the balconies also provided abbesses the chance to observe Mass while avoid being seen. Balconies merge the interior and exterior spaces of a city, a feature borrowed from Islamic architecture. The balconies in Lima have been compared to \\"streets in the sky\\" and they function as a link between private homes and Limeño streets. Antonio de la Calancha and Juan Meléndez first coined the term, writing, \\"They are so many and too large that they seem to be streets on the air.\\" Although the balconies were originally built to shield women of nobility from voyeuristic gazes, they were also sites of gossip and amorous encounters. The balconies gave the women a chance to see the city but remain hidden at the same time. Historian Charles Walker has interpreted the balconies as a manifestation of social power dynamics, as they illustrate the distinction between individuals of different classes. In the 18th century, churches and houses with grandiose balconies were indicative of affluent owners, even though the balconies were built in similar styles and materials.  Restoration efforts  = Impact of earthquakes = The earthquakes of 1655, 1687, 1746 and 1940 destroyed many of the old colonial structures in Lima designed by Francisco Pizarro and transformed the city's politics and architecture. Sturdy and less elaborate styles became increasingly popular after 1746 in order to ensure the stability of buildings. After the earthquake of 1940, Bruno Roselli, a Florentine art history professor known as the \\"defender of balconies\\", endeavored to salvage numerous balconies, many of which were of the 17th and 18th century styles. So committed was he to their salvation that he compared the balconies' importance to that of the Eiffel Tower, Statue of Liberty and the lions in Trafalgar Square. However, he was not successful. = Adopt a Balcony = The restoration of Lima's balconies was spearheaded by Alberto Andrade, Lima's mayor from 1996 to 2002. His Adopt a Balcony program saw various foreign embassies, companies and individuals partaking in preserving the balconies in exchange for tax breaks. These efforts have revived Lima's consciousness of its identity as the a City of Balconies, a term first coined by architect Adolfo Vargas. The abundance of these balconies adds to the particular harmony and originality to this part of the city.

Its protagonist, Aldo Brunelli attempts to salvage them from destruction. Evelyn Fishburn has noted that the play provides a good overview of the defenders of history and those who push for modernism. Brunelli's name is an amalgamation of Bruno Roselli.

It lives in the savanna of southern Kenya and Tanzania. Until recently, it was usually treated as a subspecies of the northern grey- headed sparrow (Passer griseus), with which it hybridizes in southern Tanzania and possibly elsewhere. It has a more rounded head profile however, a smaller eye and the grey head plumage extends unto the mantle. In addition to the subtle physical characteristics it also differs from the northern grey-headed sparrow in terms of habitat preference, nest construction and post-breeding behaviour. They build grass nests in Acacia trees in dry regions, and generally avoid moister coastal lowlands or uplands. Following the breeding season they form nomadic flocks, and the bill colour will change from black to horn-coloured. They may nest in the proximity of northern grey-headed sparrow, but not on buildings, and may be found beside individuals of the latter species as they disperse onto farmland.

He was a member of 1960s rock 'n' roll band The Valentines, sharing vocals with Bon Scott whom he later introduced to heavy rock group AC/DC. As a journalist, he wrote for Australia's teen music newspaper Go-Set from 1971, NOTE: This PDF is 282 pages. and was based in London for Immedia! from 1994 for over eight years. As a manager, his former clients include pub rock singer Jimmy Barnes and rock group Divinyls. Both his second wife, Suzi Sidewinder, and their son, Troy Lovegrove, died of HIV/AIDS; each was the subject of documentaries by Lovegrove, Suzi's Story (1987) and A Kid Called Troy (1993) respectively, which were telecast on Australian TV and internationally. He wrote, A kid called Troy: The moving journal of a little boy's battle for life in 1993, and an unauthorized biography of INXS frontman Michael Hutchence in 1999. Lovegrove died in a car accident near Byron Bay, New South Wales on 24 March 2012. 1966–70: The Valentines Vince James Lovegrove was born on 19 March 1947 at the Devonleigh Hospital, Claremont, Western Australia, to Betty (née Fry) and Dudley Lovegrove and grew up in Applecross, Western Australia with his sisters Christine and Sue. He became a singer for Perth pop groups, The Dynells (as a 14 year-old Applecross High School student), The Dimensions and The Winstons, while working as a sales assistant at Pellew's Menswear. In mid-1966, he formed The Valentines, as co-lead singer with Bon Scott from rival band, The Spektors. Other original members were, Wyn Milson on lead guitar (Spektors), Ted Ward on rhythm guitar (Winstons), John Cooksey on bass guitar (Winstons) and Warwick Findlay on drums (Ray Hoff and the Off Beats). The Valentines recorded several songs written by George Young and Harry Vanda of The Easybeats. Their cover of the Arthur Alexander song \\"Every Day I Have to Cry\\" made the Perth top 5. In 1970, they gained a place on the National Top 30 with their single \\"Juliette\\". Note: Used for Australian Singles and Albums charting from 1970 until ARIA created their own charts in mid-1988. In September 1970, The Valentines were the first Australian band arrested for marijuana possession, each member received a fine of $150 and were put on a good behaviour bond. The Valentines disbanded due to artistic differences after the much-publicised drug scandal. Scott went on to join Fraternity and later AC/DC. 1970s: Journalism, band management and television production Lovegrove moved to Adelaide in 1970 as a journalist for a magazine, and by 1971 he was writing for Go-Set, Australia's first pop music weekly newspaper, as a gossip and information columnist. In 1971, for a few months, he was the singer of the Abacus. He also had a brief solo career, with a single in 1971, \\"Livestock\\" (with b-side \\"Rented room blues\\") followed by \\"Get Myself out of This Place\\" (with b-side \\"That's allright momma\\") in 1972. He was a vocalist for Mount Lofty Rangers in early 1974, which included members of Fraternity and his former bandmate Bon Scott. With his first wife Helen Corkhill, he also ran a band management and booking agency, Jovan, in Adelaide in the 1970s. According to Lovegrove, Scott was given odd jobs in their office and was recommended to Angus Young and Malcolm Young as vocalist for their band AC/DC. Jovan briefly managed AC/DC (now with Scott as vocalist) and Cold Chisel (with Jimmy Barnes, ex-Fraternity). Becoming a parent and other factors led him to concentrate on journalism and television production including compering local TV show, The Move. From 1977, Lovegrove helped develop and broadcast Australian Music to the World for Adelaide radio station, 5KA, and in 1978 produced a TV documentary of the same title. Lovegrove relocated to Melbourne, reported on youth issues for Nine Network's A Current Affair and produced The Don Lane Show in 1978. 1980s: Divinyls, Suzi, Troy and AIDS In 1981, Lovegrove moved to Sydney and became manager for rock band Divinyls, he organised their transfer from WEA to Chrysalis and their first tours of the United States. Lovegrove had a minor role in the film, Monkey Grip (1982), with Divinyls' members Christina Amphlett and Mark McEntee supplying the soundtrack. As manager of Divinyls, he split his time between Sydney and New York City to promote them and during one of his many trips, Lovegrove met his future second wife, American-born actress Suzi Sidewinder. After living together for four years, Lovegrove married Sidewinder, but not long after the birth of their son Troy Lovegrove in 1985, the family learnt that both mother and child were HIV-positive. Suzi had unknowingly contracted HIV several years earlier and had transmitted the virus to unborn Troy. In response to experiencing prejudice and ignorance due to AIDS, Lovegrove and Suzi chose to speak out and developed Suzi's Story. The documentary won the 'Television Documentary Award' at the 1987 Human Rights Medal and Awards. and assisted to dispel public's fears, ignorance and belief that HIV was a \\"gay disease\\". Because of numerous personal pressures involving the HIV status of his wife and son, Lovegrove withdrew from managing the Divinyls, and concentrated on his wife and son. Suzi died on 14 June 1987, weeks before Suzi's Story was screened on Network Ten across Australia, it featured interviews of Suzi Lovegrove and Holly Lovegrove (his daughter from his first marriage) and footage of Troy. 1990s Lovegrove's son Troy surpassed his expected life span of 5 years after development of new anti-viral drugs, Troy became an HIV awareness campaigner, and was the subject of another documentary, A Kid Called Troy, which was made for Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) Australia. Troy died on 3 June 1993—three weeks before his 8th birthday and before it was screened nationally. Lovegrove also wrote A kid called Troy: The moving journal of a little boy's battle for life in 1993. Not long after, Lovegrove was manager for Jimmy Barnes on his European tour. He was then based in London as a journalist for Immedia! from 1994 for over eight years, reporting on the music scene for the on-line magazine. After the 1997 death of INXS frontman, Michael Hutchence, Lovegrove wrote an unauthorised biography, Michael Hutchence: Shining Through, Torn Apart (aka Michael Hutchence: A Tragic Rock 'n' Roll Story—a definitive biography) in 1999. The book was the subject of a libel action in both Sydney and London, brought by Hutchence's domestic partner, Paula Yates. Lovegrove alleged that Yates had deceived Hutchence and used her pregnancy to ensnare him. The libel case was settled for an undisclosed amount by the book's Sydney and London publishers, and the UK newspaper The Mail on Sunday, which had serialised parts in April 1999. 2000s In July 2006 Lovegrove wrote a profile of his friend Bon Scott for The Australian newspaper. This commemorated what would have been Scott's 60th birthday (Scott died in 1980). His band, Mongrels of Passion, featured alongside Noiseworks and Rose Tattoo at the Bon Scott Statue unveiling in Fremantle in February 2008. In 2007, Mongrels of Passion had released their eponymous 5track-CD. Mongrels of Passion, including Lovegrove and Tim Gaze performed at the 2008 Adelaide International Guitar Festival held on 29 November - 7 December. In 2009, Mongrels of Passion released their 2nd 5track- CD called \\"Mongrels of Passion 2\\". Personal life Lovegrove was married three times. His first marriage (1972–1979) was to Helen Corkhill, who assisted him in running band management and booking agency Jovan in Adelaide in the 1970s. They are the parents of Holly Lovegrove (born 1975). His second wife, Suzi Sidewinder, lived with Lovegrove from 1981 to their marriage in 1985, up until her death from HIV/AIDS on 14 June 1987, which is depicted in an award-winning documentary, Suzi's Story, shown on Network Ten in Australia. Their son, Troy Lovegrove (born 25 June 1985), contracted HIV in utero and died on 3 June 1993. His third marriage, to Caroline Thompson (1994–1997) resulted in his youngest child, Lilli-Rae (born 1995). In 1997, Thompson left Lovegrove and Lilli-Rae. Lovegrove has two other sons, Jason and Jo. Until his death, Lovegrove lived at Rosebank about 30 km west of Byron Bay, New South Wales with his daughter Lilli-Rae, not far from his elder daughter Holly and her sons Arlo (born 1996) and Marlon (2011). =Death= On 24 March 2012, Vince Lovegrove died, aged 65, in a car accident at Federal, near Bangalow, New South Wales, about 20 km west (inland) of Byron Bay. A preliminary police report on 25 March indicated that Lovegrove's Kombi Van left Binna Burra Road, rolled and exploded into flames between 1 am and 3 am the previous day. There was one deceased person in the van and positive identification of Lovegrove's body was delayed. On 26 March, Lovegrove's family issued a statement confirming his death and that they were planning a public memorial and funeral services. On 28 March, he had been due to start work as a journalist at Lismore's The Northern Star.

History  It was founded in 1189 and dedicated to the Virgin Mary under the patronage of Maredudd ap Cynan ab Owain Gwynedd (d. 1212), Lord of Merioneth (grandson of Owain Gwynedd), and of his brother, Gruffudd ap Cynan, prince of N. Wales (d. 1200). It was a daughter house of Abbeycwmhir in Powys. The remains of the church and west tower are very plain, but substantial with walls surviving about nave archway height. It is a simple nave with aisles, lacking northern and southern transepts, and the choir and presbytery are incorporated into the nave. The abbey has buff sandstone dressings and some red sandstone carvings, but is primarily of local rubble construction. The foundations of the cloister and other monastic buildings are visible to the south. The abbot's house remain to the west of the site and have been extensively remodelled as a farmhouse. Like other Cistercian communities in Wales, Cymer Abbey farmed sheep and bred horses, supplying them to Llywelyn ap Iorwerth, Llewelyn the Great. Llewelyn gifted the Abbey mining rights in 1209. However, despite this the Abbey was not prosperous: it lacked much arable land and had limited fishing rights. In 1291, annual income was £28 8s 3d. The Welsh Wars of Edward I (1276–77 and 1282–3) probably contributed to the abbey's relative poverty, for instance the failure to build the usual Cistercian central tower is one indication of this. While Alun John Richards argues that the cooler climate of the 14th century unduly affected the Abbey's lands which were largely mountainous. The Abbey was a base for the troops of Prince Llywelyn ap Gruffudd in 1275 and 1279. In 1283 Edward I occupied the Abbey and a year later gave the Abbey compensation of £80 for damage caused in the recent wars. By 1388 the monastery was home to no more than five monks and it seems that there was a marked decline in the standard of religious observance. In the survey of 1535, the annual income of the house was valued at little over £51 and the abbey was dissolved with the smaller monasteries in 1536–7, most likely in March 1537. The monastery was small and relatively unimportant. However, Cymer did possess a fine, thirteenth century silver gilt chalice and paten (Eucharist plate), which must have been hidden at the Dissolution; rediscovered in 1898, under a stone at Cym-y-mynach, they are now in the National Museum of Wales in Cardiff. A small stream runs south of the cloister, and the site is on the banks of the River Mawddach and lies just above the confluence of the River Wnion with the Mawddach Cymer; and therefore the monastery was given the full title of Kymer deu dyfyr, which means 'the meeting of the waters'. It was sited at the lowest ford across the Mawddach. It is now in the care of Cadw. As with other monastic sites in England and Wales, the abbey did not survive the Dissolution of the 1530s, and parts of the fabric were recycled for their dressed stone. Situated next to the surviving farm, the remaining ruins are open to the public on most days of the year.

She worked at KGTV from 1996 to 2008. She was also the executive director of Pacific Arts Movement (Pac-Arts, formerly the San Diego Asian Film Foundation) until 2016. Pac-Arts presents the annual San Diego Asian Film Festival, an event she founded in 2000 with the Asian American Journalists Association of San Diego. She has been married to Louis Song since 1997, with whom she has two sons. Background Lee Ann Kim was born in Seoul, South Korea and she emigrated with her family to Downers Grove, Illinois, near Chicago in 1971, where she spent most of her childhood with her three younger sisters, her mother, and her father, who is a doctor. Her youngest sister Beverly Kim is a celebrated chef who made it to the final four of the 2011 season of Top Chef. Kim majored in broadcast journalism with a minor in Spanish at the University of Maryland. She married Louis Song, the CEO of a staffing company, in 1997. After discussing it for many years, Kim and Song were inspired by a story she watched regarding former National Football League quarterback Dan Marino's own family, prompting the couple to adopt a child while having a birth child of their own. They contacted the Holt International adoption agency and were matched with a boy in March, 2005. However, when the agency was notified that Kim was due to give birth in July 2005, the agency put a stop to the adoption process and reassigned the boy to another family. This was devastating for Kim, who had already named the boy Samuel. Her birth child, Weston Yongwon Song, was born in 2005. Lee Ann and Louis Song continued to pursue adoption as soon as her first son was born. On June 16, 2006, they were introduced to 4 month old Samuel Hyungwon Song, her newly adopted son, at Los Angeles International Airport. Samuel was born in February, 2006. Professional career =Broadcast news= While a senior at the University of Maryland, she was a bureau reporter for four Washington D.C. area radio stations, covering Maryland state politics in Annapolis for Capitol News Service. In 1993, she landed her first TV job at the nation's first all- news local broadcast station, KNWS-TV in Houston, Texas. She moved in 1994 to become the main anchor at WCFT, the CBS affiliate station in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. In 1995, she then moved to Springfield, Missouri to work at KYTV, the local NBC affiliate, where she became the first person of color to anchor the news in the Ozarks. In 1996, she accepted an offer from KGTV to work in San Diego, starting in March 1996. While working for KGTV news, Kim covered Santana and Granite Hills high school shootings, the search for Danielle van Dam, the Heaven's Gate suicides, and the 1996 Republican National Convention. In 2005, she was promoted to the 5:30 pm weekday anchor position. In 2006, she was named as co-host of the newly created hour-long 4:00 pm news program called 10-4 San Diego, which was later cancelled due to low ratings in August 2006. In August 2008, Lee Ann chose not to accept the station's offer of a lower salary and longer hours and left the news business. =San Diego Asian Film Festival= Kim started the San Diego Asian Film Festival (SDAFF) in 2000, inspired by a conversation she had overheard while speaking at a local technology company. The first SDAFF was held in August 2000 on the campus of the University of California, San Diego with five features, multiple shorts, and guest appearances from Margaret Cho and Tamlyn Tomita. In 2002, the organization running the SDAFF applied for nonprofit status as the San Diego Asian Film Foundation. After the scope of the San Diego Asian Film Foundation grew beyond film, the nonprofit was rebranded the Pacific Arts Movement (Pac- Arts) in 2012. Kim served as the executive director the San Diego Asian Film Foundation and Pac-Arts until she retired from the nonprofit in April 2016. Awards She has received numerous awards for her work including an Emmy Award for investigative reporting, the California Teacher's Association award for best educational reporting for her coverage of bilingual education, and best news report by the California Chicano News Media Association, and two national Asian American Journalists Association awards for best reporting in Asian and non-Asian related issues. Since leaving KGTV, Kim has been honored for her nonprofit work including being awarded the 2010 KPBS Hero of the Month award, a 10News Leadership Award, San Diego Magazine′s Top 50 People to Watch in 2009, and she was featured on the cover of San Diego Family Magazine in May 2010.

He is the son of the classical clarinetists Stanley Drucker (the retired principal clarinetist of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra) and Naomi Drucker. As a child, he played the cello and later learned bass guitar. Biography =Personal life= Lee Rocker was born Leon Drucker in Massapequa, Long Island, New York, on August 3, 1961 He is the son of classical clarinetists Stanley and Naomi Drucker. Stanley Drucker was the principal clarinetist for the New York Philharmonic Orchestra and played with Leonard Bernstein and Aaron Copland. His sister Roseanne is a country music singer-songwriter. At age 12, Rocker picked up the electric bass but quickly developed a preference for playing the double bass as his instrument of choice. He credits records by Elvis Presley and Carl Perkins for his new inclination \\"The slap bass on those records blew me away!\\" Rocker's favorite bass player is Willie Dixon. He married his wife Deborah in 1989. She is the daughter of Gucci watchmaking pioneer, Severin Wunderman. In the fall of 2013, she launched her own eponymous fashion line. They reside in Laguna Beach, California with their two children. Rocker is a fan of the Lakers and the Angels. =Career= Drucker's school friends included James McDonnell and Brian Setzer. The three of them played together regularly and widened their musical interests to include the blues and rockabilly. Drucker also learned to play the double bass to incorporate the sounds of blues and rockabilly on the acoustic instrument. The three of them formed the group Stray Cats in 1979. McDonnell took on the stage name of \\"Slim Jim Phantom\\", and Drucker devised his own stage name to \\"Lee Rocker\\". Rocker evolved his own style of slap-bass playing with the group. Rocker and Stray Cats sold nearly 10 million albums and garnered twenty three gold and platinum certified records worldwide, and made them a mainstay on MTV. In addition to Stray Cats, Lee Rocker, and Phantom, Rocker & Slick albums, Rocker has recorded or performed with Carl Perkins, George Harrison, Ringo Starr, Willie Nelson, Leon Russell, Keith Richards, John Fogerty, and Scotty Moore. Rocker was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1982, as was his father, they are the second father-son duo to be nominated for a Grammy in the same year. He is considered to be an influential upright bassist in rock and roll. Lee Rocker performing at Memphis International Rockabilly Festival, August 2015 Accompanied by Slim Jim Phantom and guitarist Earl Slick, Rocker formed the band Phantom, Rocker & Slick and recorded two albums for EMI Records titled Phantom, Rocker & Slick and Cover Girl. The song \\"Men Without Shame\\" landing Rocker back on MTV and in the charts. For Black Top Records, Rocker released the albums Big Blue (1994) and Atomic Boogie Hour (1995). He has also recorded for Alligator Records. He released the album, Bulletproof, in 2003. His other albums included Black Cat Bone, released in August 2007, which featured Brophy Dale on guitar and Jimmy Sage on drums. Buzz Campbell (Hot Rod Lincoln and Sha Na Na) joined the band three years prior and gave them a Gretsch guitar sound. In 2011, Lee released an EP called The Cover Sessions which features cover versions of songs such as the John Lennon/Paul McCartney song \\"Come Together\\", Elton John's \\"Honky Cat\\", and the Allman Brothers song \\"Ramblin' Man\\". In addition to recording and touring, Rocker has hosted a radio show on KXFM-LP called Rumble and Twang with Lee Rocker. Lee Rocker joined the cast of the Broadway hit Million Dollar Quartet as bassist Clayton Perkins, the brother of Sun Records recording artist Carl Perkins in a twelve-show run from January 21 through 31, 2011. He topped off the show with a special encore performance with the cast and an appearance on New York Today. Lee Rocker's latest band consists of Buzz Campbell (electric guitar & banjo), Larry Mitchel (drums), and Matthew Jordan (piano, harmonica, acoustic guitar). = The Low Road (2018–2019) = Lee's latest album The Low Road was recorded live with his four-piece band at Daryl's House in Pawling, NY (a listening room venue owned by Daryl Hall of Hall & Oates). Initially, it was released via physical prints of CD/DVDs & vinyl in December 2018. It was released via digital streaming on August 9, 2019 = 40 & reunion tour with Stray Cats (2018–2019) = After a ten-year hiatus from Stray Cats, Rocker reunited on stage with Setzer and Phantom in 2018 at the Viva Las Vegas Festival and a 2019 summer world tour was announced.

In an interview with the magazine, Rocker said about the song: \\"It's a tribute in a lot of ways,... It's a song I wrote over the last couple of months. I was thinking about my career with 40 years of Stray Cats and all of that and thinking about the upright bass, which is what started this thing. It takes me back to the opening line of the song -- which is \\"Took me 'round the world and I changed my name/found a little fortune, found a little fame/Doin' the dog house shuffle\\" -- which is right out of my story. Dog House is what they call the upright bass, so it's a tribute to the bass itself and a lot of the players that I came up listening to.\\" On October 30, 2019, \\"Dog House Shuffle\\" was officially released on all digital platforms. =Awards and honors= In 2013, Rocker received a Lifetime Achievement Award from Bass Player magazine and gave master classes in London and Los Angeles.

It is the smallest member of the sparrow family, at about long. The breeding male has deep chestnut plumage and the female and juvenile are coloured a duller grey with some chestnut markings. Like its closest relatives in the genus Passer, the Arabian golden sparrow and the Sudan golden sparrow, it is gregarious and found in arid areas. Ranging through the east of Africa from Darfur in Sudan to Tanzania, it is found in dry savanna, papyrus swamps, and near human habitation. Adults and juveniles both feed mostly on grass seeds, and fly in flocks, often with other species of birds, to find food. It nests in trees, building its own domed nests, and also usurping the more elaborate nests of weavers. Taxonomy and systematics From left to right, the Arabian golden sparrow, which has mostly yellow plumage, the Sudan golden sparrow, which is yellow with a brown back, and the brown chestnut sparrow This species was first described in 1880, by Gustav Hartlaub in the Journal für Ornithologie, as Sorella Emini Bey. Hartlaub gave it the specific name Emini Bey in honour of the explorer Emin Pasha, who collected the type specimen in modern South Sudan or Uganda near Lado, and it is occasionally given the eponymous common name Emin Bey's sparrow. Hartlaub's unusual spelling of its specific epithet as two words led some to spell the name emini or emini-bey. No subspecies are recognised, but one was described by British ornithologist George L. G. Van Someren in 1922 from Archers Post in central Kenya, as Sorella eminibey guasso. Hartlaub considered the chestnut sparrow's colouration and morphology to be distinct enough to allocate it to its own monotypic genus, Sorella. Although a few authors have followed Hartlaub's treatment, it is usually placed in the genus Passer. It is very similar to the two golden sparrows, from which it may have once been only clinally different. The male Arabian golden sparrow is almost entirely gold-coloured, the male chestnut sparrow is mostly chestnut, and the male Sudan golden sparrow is intermediate between the two. British ornithologist Richard Meinertzhagen considered these three species to be conspecific; however, the range of the Sudan golden sparrow overlaps with that of the chestnut sparrow without any known interbreeding in a small area of Sudan. These species are similar in their behaviour, which is adapted to the unpredictable conditions of their arid habitat. In particular, they and the Dead Sea sparrow share a courtship display in which males quiver their wings above their body. This intense display is probably an adaptation to nesting in a clump of trees surrounded by similar habitat, where such an intense display may serve important purposes in keeping a colony together. The chestnut and golden sparrows have been seen as highly primitive among the genus Passer, only distantly related to the house sparrow and the related \\"Palaearctic black-bibbed sparrows\\". In recognition of this they are sometimes placed in a separate genus or subgenus Auripasser. The courtship display of the Dead Sea sparrow was thought to have evolved separately in a similar environment from that of these species, in an example of convergent evolution. However, mitochondrial DNA phylogenies indicate that the chestnut and golden sparrows are either derived from or are the closest relatives of the Palaearctic black- bibbed sparrows. Description An immature male in Tanzania Like the other members of the sparrow family, the chestnut sparrow is a small, chunky songbird with a thick bill suited to its diet of seeds. At in length, it is the smallest member of the sparrow family. It weighs between and . Wing length ranges from in males and from in females. The tail, bill, and tarsus lengths are about , , and respectively. The plumage of the breeding male is mostly a deep shade of chestnut in colour with black colouration on the face, wings, and tail. The breeding male is not easily confused with any other birds except the chestnut weaver, which is substantially larger and has white on its wings. The breeding male's legs and feet are horn (pale grey) in colour. The non- breeding male chestnut sparrow has white flecking on the upperparts, and much of its plumage is buff or whitish with chestnut crescent markings, until the bright chestnut of the breeding plumage is exposed by wear. The non-breeding male's bill fades to a dusky-tipped horn, similar to that of females, but without dusky tones on the cutting edge of the mandible (lower portion of beak). Females have the same plumage pattern as males, though with somewhat duller colouration. The female has a grey head; buff supercilium, chin, and throat; black and warm brown upperparts; and off-white underparts. The bill of the female is pale yellow with the tip and cutting edge of mandible dusky. Juveniles are dull grey with a brown back, a pale yellow supercilium, and a pale horn bill. Females and juveniles have hints of chestnut on their supercilium, shoulders, and throat, by which they may be distinguished from other sparrows, such as the Kenya sparrow and the other rufous sparrows, which are common in much of the chestnut sparrow's range; or the house sparrow, which also occurs in parts of its range. The basic call of the chestnut sparrow is a subdued chirp, with two recorded variations: a scolding threat call, rendered chrrrrit or chrrrrreeeerrrrrrrr and a chew chew flight call. Displaying males give a high twittering trill, rendered as tchiweeza tchiweeza tchi-tchi-tchi-tchi- see-see-see-seeichi. Distribution and habitat alt=A small mainly chestnut coloured sparrow with a broad beak feeding on scraps of food placed on a stone slab The chestnut sparrow is found in East Africa in mostly lower country from Darfur through Kordofan, South Sudan, Somalia, Uganda, and Kenya to north-central Tanzania. Its range also extends northeast into the southwest and Great Rift Valley of Ethiopia. Like the golden sparrows, it is sometimes nomadic when not breeding. Vagrants have been recorded as far from their breeding range as Dar es Salaam. It is found mostly in dry savanna and in fields and villages, but unlike its relations the golden sparrows, it is sometimes found in swamps of papyrus (certain Cyperus spp.). Its population has not been quantified, but it appears to be common across a very large range and it is assessed by the IUCN Red List as Least Concern for global extinction. Behaviour and ecology Chestnut sparrows are gregarious, and are only occasionally found away from flocks. They frequently associate with queleas and other weavers. Adults feed on grass seeds, and those near human habitations will also eat crumbs and other household scraps. Nestlings are fed mostly softer grass seeds, and small beetles are also recorded in their diet. =Breeding= alt=Several round birds' nests are fixed onto the smaller branches of a tree The nesting behaviour of the chestnut sparrow chestnut sparrow has been the subject of confusion. Early reports described the chestnut sparrow's nest as being a typical sparrow nest built in a tree; later it was reported that chestnut sparrows had elaborate nests like those of weavers. In 1967, the ornithologist Robert B. Payne studied chestnut sparrows in a grey-capped social weaver colony in an acacia grove near Lake Magadi in southern Kenya, and in 1969 he reported his findings in the ornithological journal The Ibis. Payne found that chestnut sparrows only nested by usurping the nests of the social-weavers. After reporting this, and noting that the distribution of the chestnut sparrow closely coincides with that of the social-weavers of the genus Pseudonigrita, Payne suggested that the chestnut sparrow was an obligate nest parasite (not a brood parasite, like many Old World cuckoos and cowbirds). Payne also noted in his paper that \\"Nest parasitism is generally thought to have been a stage in the evolutionary development of brood parasitism\\", an idea that remains accepted, and suggested the chestnut sparrow could be evolving towards obligate brood parasitism. However, it is known that besides parasitising the nests of weavers or using their abandoned nests, the chestnut sparrow also builds its own nests. Nests built by the chestnut sparrow, like most sparrow nests, are untidy domed structures which are made of grass and lined with feathers. Its breeding season varies between different regions, following rains, and the breeding seasons of its hosts in areas where it parasitises nests; as a result it has been recorded breeding in every month of the year across its range. At Payne's study locality the breeding season of the chestnut sparrow lagged behind that of its host. The sparrows began courting when the weavers started constructing their elaborate nests. Once the breeding season began, \\"the first impression was of the sparrows nesting and the grey-capped social weavers unobtrusively skulking nearby\\". Males displayed around the new weaver nests, crouching, raising and quivering their wings in a shallow V, and giving a high, twittering trill. The males were chased by the social-weavers, but returned persistently, until joined by females. When a female came near a displaying male, the male would increase his rate of wing quivering, spread and depress his tail, and bow down his head, until his body formed an arc. This exaggerated display may be an adaptation related to pair formation in the absence of male nest-building, and it may also serve to focus attention in breeding colonies and keep the birds in a colony together, as colonies are in clumps of trees surrounded by similar habitat. During Payne's study, copulation was seen only in the acacias, around the social-weaver nests. Females would fly to displaying males and solicit copulation in typical sparrow fashion, crouching, quivering, and drooping their wings. When males saw displaying females, they would fly to them and mount them immediately. Males continued their wing quivering during copulation, and females would crouch, quiver, raise their head, and hold their tails horizontally. After a copulation the female would fly off and the male would continue displaying. During this courtship and afterwards, males and mated pairs would interfere with the social-weavers' nest building, until they drove the social-weavers out. During Payne's study period, \\"Chases and fights between the two species were seen nearly every minute of observation\\", and the male sparrows spent about a fifth of their day annoying the social-weavers. Little is recorded of incubation and fledging periods in the wild. In captivity the incubation period lasts for 18 to 19 days. Clutches typically contain three or four eggs, which are ovular, mostly coloured white or bluish-white. Some observations indicate that nestlings are fed by the female alone.

He played college football for Ohio State University, and twice earned All-American honors. He was the first overall pick of the 1979 NFL Draft, and played professionally for the CFL's Montreal Alouettes and the NFL's Cleveland Browns and San Francisco 49ers. Cousineau is a member of the College Football Hall of Fame, elected in the class of 2016. He is also a member of the Ohio State Varsity \\"O\\" Hall of Fame, inducted in 1995, and St. Edward High School Hall of Fame. Cousineau was the recipient of the Silver Anniversary Butkus Award in 2003. Early years Cousineau was born in Fairview Park, Ohio, to Carol and Tom Cousineau Sr, who was the head football and a wrestling coach at Lakewood (Ohio) High School. Consequently, his mother did not want him to play football under the shadow of his father. Thus, Cousineau played high school football for nearby St. Edward High School, which is several blocks away in Lakewood. He excelled and was one of the most highly recruited football players in the country in his senior year.Cousineau stayed close to home retrieved March 8, 2006 He graduated in 1975.Staff Writer Pinned, St. Edward Magazine, Winter 2008 - vol. 6, issue 2, page 18 Cousineau was also an accomplished wrestler. In 1975, under legendary coach Howard Ferguson, he lost to future NFL player Bob Golic from cross-town all-boys school rival St. Joseph High School in the Ohio state wrestling tournament semifinals in the heavyweight weight class. The match has been called \\"one of the most memorable,\\" Golic would go on to win the state title and Cousineau would finish in third place. Golic would go to be two-time All-American at heavyweight at Notre Dame. Cousineau and Golic would eventually become teammates in the NFL with the Browns. College football career Cousineau attended Ohio State University, where he played for legendary coach Woody Hayes' Ohio State Buckeyes football team from 1975 to 1978. During that span, Ohio State had an overall record of 36-10-2 and 28–4 in the Big Ten, were three-time Big Ten champs. The Buckeyes played four bowl games after each of the seasons he played: in the Rose Bowl, Orange Bowl, Sugar Bowl and Gator Bowl. They were a Top 5 team for 36 weeks over these four years and the No. 1 team in the nation for eight weeks in 1975, and ultimately finished fourth, sixth and 12th in the final Associated Press polls in 1975, 1976 and 1977, respectively. Cousineau majored in marketing. He was a consensus first-team All-American, breaking the school record with 211 tackles in a single season in 1978,Cousineau college bio retrieved March 8, 2006. an average of 17.5 a game. He also broke the school record for most tackles in a game with 29 against Penn State in 1978, and was the MVP of the 1977 Orange Bowl. Cousineau's last game for the Buckeyes was the infamous 1978 Gator Bowl against Clemson, during which Coach Hayes punched Clemson linebacker Charlie Bauman in the final minutes of the game. Hayes was fired the following day for the incident. Cousineau still holds many of Ohio State's tackling records. As of 2016, he holds six of the top 10 single-game tackling records, 29 single- game tackles (since tied by fellow College Football Hall of Famer Chris Spielman), most solo tackles in a single game, (16 against SMU in 1978). He also ranks second on both the all-time OSU tackle list with 569 (three behind Marcus Marek) and on the career solo tackles list with 259. He was named an All-American in 1977 and 1978. The Chicago Tribune named him the MVP of the Big Ten in 1978. He graduated from OSU in 1979. In 2016, he became the 25th Ohio State player, along with seven Buckeye coaches, to be named to the College Football Hall of Fame. Professional football career Cousineau was drafted first overall in the 1979 NFL Draft by the Buffalo Bills, who acquired the pick as a part of a package of five draft picks from the San Francisco 49ers in a 1978 trade for O.J. Simpson. However, he never played a game for the Bills. He instead signed with the Canadian Football League's Montreal Alouettes, who signed him for double the money originally offered by the Bills. Cousineau became a star for the Alouettes, becoming the Grey Cup Most Valuable Player in the 1979 season. He only played in four games in his third season because of an elbow injury while the Alouettes collapsed. In 1982, Cousineau wanted to return to the NFL, choosing to forego two optional years with the Alouettes. The Houston Oilers attempted to sign him, but the Bills (who still held Cousineau's NFL rights) matched the offer. Cleveland Browns owner Art Modell had long been interested in signing him. Cousineau was then traded from the Bills to the Cleveland Browns for a first-round draft choice (14th overall) in the 1983 NFL Draft, plus a second and a third draft choice in subsequent years. That first-round pick was used on future Hall of Fame quarterback Jim Kelly. Cousineau signed a five-year contract for $2.5 million, the highest contract ever at the time by the Browns.Cousineau Signs Rich Browns' Pact retrieved March 8, 2006 In 1983, Cousineau was arrested in connection with minor collision with a police car on Saint Patrick's Day He was charged with drunk driving, improperly using traffic lanes, and not having his driver's license. He was subsequently found not guilty of the drunk driving charge, but guilty of the moving violation (the driver's license charge was dropped). During Cousineau's four seasons with the Browns, he led the team in tackles for three seasons. In the 1983 season, he intercepted 4 passes and was named a 2nd-team All-NFL by the NEA. He was also named 2nd-team all NFL by the AP in 1984, but never made the Pro Bowl in his career. He was considered an overpaid disappointment in Cleveland, while Bills fans fondly remember the fact that the man who once snubbed them for the CFL was traded for Jim Kelly. Cousineau signed with the San Francisco 49ers as a free agent after the 1985 season where he played two years as a reserve before retiring in 1987. Cousineau finished his NFL career with ten interceptions and 6.5 career sacks.

At the instigation of William Penn, Jennings allowed himself to be popularly elected as governor, causing a falling-out with Byllynge, who believed this to be an illegal usurpation of his authority.

Lloyd (1916–1942), who was killed in action while serving aboard on 6 May 1942 during the Battle of Corregidor. Lloyd was laid down on 26 July 1943 by the Charleston Navy Yard, launched on 23 November 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Ella Lee Lloyd, mother of Ensign Lloyd; and commissioned on 11 February 1944, Lieutenant Commander Peter N. Gammelgard in command. Service history =World War II, 1944-1946= After shakedown off Bermuda, the new destroyer escort left Norfolk, Virginia on 12 May 1944 with 13 other destroyer escorts and a convoy of 100 transport ships bound for North Africa. The British relieved the escort ships at Bizerte, Tunisia, on 1 June; nine days later Lloyd and her sister ships departed to escort another convoy on the westward passage home. While en route, Lloyd was reclassified APD-63 on 5 July 1944 and ordered to report to the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 29 June for conversion to a . Three months later, after conversion and shakedown, Lloyd steamed for the Pacific War zones, touched Bora Bora, Society Islands, on 20 October, and arrived Hollandia, New Guinea, on 4 November. Soon thereafter she became the permanent flagship for Transport Division 103. Moving to Leyte on 23 November, for the next five months Lloyd transported invasion troops, as the Allies completed the Philippine liberation. In her first action on 7 December, the new transport ship landed troops at Ormoc on the western coast of Leyte. Ten days later he took part in the daring strike at Mindoro, the Japanese held island 500 miles northwest of Leyte. After Mindoro, she steamed via Lingayen to Hollandia to embark troops for the assault at Lingayen Gulf in northern Luzon. Departing New Guinea on 4 January 1945, she landed her troops at Lingayen a week later. That afternoon, the transport's guns knocked out an enemy shore battery. The next day Lloyd departed and fought her way back to Leyte, splashing four enemy suicide planes during the three-day passage. During February the ship took part in the assaults on San Felipe and Subic Bay. On the 28th, she brought troops from Mindoro to help liberate the Island of Palawan, a vital stepping stone to Borneo. Another gateway to Borneo, Mindanao, ignored as the Navy leapfrogged to Leyte and Luzon, now had to be secured. Jumping off from Mindoro 8 March, two days later, Lloyd put troops ashore to liberate Zamboanga on the westernmost tip of Mindanao, then steamed to Leyte that evening. Following repairs and patrol duty off Leyte during April, the ship shifted operations to Morotai on 7 May to participate in the liberation of Borneo. From 28 May to 19 June, she assisted the amphibious forces landing at Brunei Bay on the western coast of Borneo. During early July, Lloyd twice ferried reinforcements from Morotai to the landings at Balikpapan on the eastern coast. In the last weeks of the war, the ship trained Army troops in amphibious warfare, then after V-J Day, transported occupation units from Okinawa to Korea. She departed Okinawa for Pearl Harbor on 26 November 1945, en route to the east coast to join the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. She reached the Brooklyn Navy Yard on 2 January 1946. Following a month in drydock, she steamed to Green Cove Springs, Florida, and decommissioned there on 1 July 1946. =Korean War, 1951-1953= Under the demands of the Korean War, Lloyd recommissioned on 3 January 1951, Lieutenant Commander A. A. Sullivan in command. After shakedown in Chesapeake Bay and availability at the Boston Naval Shipyard, she reported to the Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek, Virginia, on 26 September for local training duty. From April through October she operated with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. =Atlantic coast, 1953-1958= From 1953 through 1957 the high speed transport continued to operate with the Marines out of Little Creek, VA. During this period she often operated in the Caribbean and visited most of the ports along the eastern seaboard. During this same period she also carried UDT (Underwater Demolition Teams) on demolition and retrieval exercises. She also participated in many ASW (Anti-Submarine Warfare) exercises in concert with U.S submarines; during these exercises she operated as a team with U.S. Coast Guard ships during the submarine chasing. The Lloyd was also deployed with a small group of other ships to the Suez Canal during the Suez crisis - the group was recalled back to port after about 2 days at sea and never got to the Canal. =Decommissioning and sale= Lloyd decommissioned on 18 February 1958 at Charleston, South Carolina, and rejoined the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. She was struck from the Navy List on 1 June 1966 and sold for scrap.

Sometimes considered a subspecies of the grey-headed sparrow, it occurs in northeastern Africa, largely in the Ethiopian Highlands. This sparrow was named after the English naturalist and illustrator William John Swainson.  Description  The Swainson's sparrow reaches a body length of . There is no conspicuous sexual dimorphism. It is often considered a race of grey-headed sparrow, but it tends to be darker, especially on the head and shoulders. There is a white bar on the shoulder, but this is not always visible. Similarly, the pale chestnut tail and rump is not always visible.  Distribution and habitat  It occurs in the highlands of Ethiopia and Somalia, and in some of Sudan, South Sudan, Eritrea, Djibouti, and Kenya. Apart from the far west, it is common throughout its range. Some populations show seasonal migrations. The habitats of the Swainson's sparrow are mountainous areas, marshes, open forest areas, savannas and shrubby grasslands. However, most often it occurs in human settlements and their surroundings. In Eritrea, it lives mostly on the open plateau at an altitude of above sea level, and in Ethiopia it occurs in areas of above sea level. In Ethiopian towns it is the common sparrow, similarly to the house sparrow in most of Eurasia.  Behaviour  Swainson's sparrows eat mostly seeds of grasses and cereals, and insects. The nest is a loose ball assembled from grass and feathers. A nest may be built on branches, or in the crown of palm trees, or in tree hollows. The birds also use cavities in buildings, and the old nests of the Ethiopian swallow and African sand martin. They have been observed once removing nestlings of the African sand martin to take over their nests. A clutch contains three to six eggs. They are white with brown and gray spots. The breeding season falls in Eritrea during January to March and May to November, in Ethiopia breeding may occur from April to December. Outside the breeding season they live in flocks, sometimes consisting of several hundred individuals. Swarms of this size can cause some damage when they come in agricultural regions and gardens.

The house lies within Richmond's Monument Avenue Historic District, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1967. Branch House itself was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. The district's status was extended in 1989 and subsequently upgraded to a National Historic Landmark in 1997. After a Branch family heir gifted the home to a local charity in the 1950s, the house changed ownership several times until it was purchased in 2003 by the Virginia Architecture Foundation (formerly the Virginia Center for Architecture Foundation) and reopened in 2005 as headquarters of its successor, the Virginia Center for Architecture (VCA), offices for the Virginia Society of the American Institute of Architects (VSAIA) and its now defunct publication, Inform magazine. The building also houses the Branch Museum of Architecture and Design. Historical significance After designing Branch House, the firm of John Russell Pope (1874–1937) became widely known for designing the National Archives and Records Administration building (1935), the Jefferson Memorial (1943) and the West Building of the National Gallery of Art (1941) in Washington, DC. Pope's partner, Otto R. Eggers (1882–1964), completed those commissions after Pope's death in 1937, and subsequently designed prominent projects including the interior of the (1952) and the Morehead Planetarium at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Branch House was thus elevated to the National Register because it was designed by one of the country's prominent architectural firms during the early 20th century; because it is the only example of the firm's domestic work in Virginia; and because it is the only example of the firm's Tudor-Jacobean Revival residences in which the interiors have survived intact. In addition, the house is located within a historic district of cultural significance and is the largest house in the city of Richmond. Branch House accurately reflects a particular period of American history, in the early decades of the twentieth century, when English architectural styles were fashionable among wealthy industrialists and financiers. The client was also scion to a distinguished Virginia family and had assembled a substantial collection of Renaissance artifacts. Design Branch House Eggers and Higgins in their New York City offices in 1941 After receiving the gift of half a city block from his father, John Kerr and Beulah Branch commissioned the firm of John Russell Pope for the design. The site was adjacent to the colonnaded memorial to Jefferson Davis at 2501 Monument Avenue at Davis Street, in what is now the Monument Avenue Historic District, itself within Richmond's Fan district. Notably, the site is on axis with the Broad Street Station to the north, possibly related to John Kerr Branch's professional associations with the railroad. =Overall design= According to the 1984 application to the National Register of Historic Places, Pope himself had limited involvement in the project and never visited the building. The architectural construction drawings were dated August 18, 1916, and signed by his business partner, architect Otto R. Eggers. Floor plans included 28 major rooms: public halls, galleries, private suites, servants' quarters, a ballroom, and storage rooms designated specifically for carpets, china, paintings – and suits of armour. The overall size of the house has been reported as ranging from 27,000 to 33,000 sq ft. It is roughly three times the size of its neighbors on Monument Avenue. Branch House features a central portion flanked by two projecting pavilions. The roof is double- pitched with parapets and castellation (or crenelations), creating numerous complexities and hidden flat areas. The eastern pavilion has a three-story castellated bay. The 1984 application to the National Register of Historic Places described the home's relationship to the street as \\"extremely awkward.\\" Pope's office had made provision for a garage on Park Avenue, but a two-door garage was not added until the 1920s, at the west end of the building. Although from the outside the house appears to have three storeys, and although the interior is logically laid out, the interior is organized on numerous different levels -- variously reported as ranging from 11 levels to as many as 19. =Style and inspiration= The historic style of Branch House has been variously reported as Tudor, Tudor Revival, Tudor-Jacobean or Domestic Tudor. The 1984 application to the National Register of Historic Places noted that the design \\"incorporated salient features from several 16th- century English country houses to form a convincingly correct assemblage of design elements,\\" adding that \\"to maintain the illusion of age, the architect had the building materials distressed and aged to add patina to the image of power and pedigree\\" and furthermore that \\"barons of American industry, finance, and culture, such as Branch, appropriated the traditions of English domestic architecture as a way of asserting a noble lineage for their class.\\" John Russell Pope had traveled extensively and the firm based the design for Branch House on a large 16th-century country house in Warwickshire, England known as Compton Wynyates, which features numerous exterior details also found at Branch House including linenfold paneling inside and exterior half- timbering and brick diapering, along with oriel and casement windows with leaded glass. Pope's office primarily borrowed details and design elements from Compton Wynyates, which wraps around a large interior courtyard, sits on the interior of a large country parcel, and is highly expansive and asymmetrical. Branch House, by contrast, includes no courtyard, sits adjacent to a street corner on an urban parcel and is largely compact and more symmetrical. =Construction and details= Exterior features of Branch House include its perimeter wall of brick construction, wall materials of weathered brick combined with distressed and patinized briarcliff sandstone, sculpted stone motifs, sandstone door and window surrounds, chimney pots, brickwork with diamond diapering, leaded glass, carved-stone heraldry, oriel windows with cul-de-lampe (corbeling resembling the conical bottom of ancient lamps), bargeboards resembling those of Compton Wynyates, inscriptions at the window heads referring to the Branch family's arrival in Virginia during the 17th century, a tower reminiscent of that at Hampton Court Palace, and three characteristically Tudor twisted brick chimneys that resemble those found in Tudor pattern books of the period. The interior features vaulted ceilings, curvilinear tracery featuring heraldic symbols, heavily decorated pargeted Tudor-style plaster molding, and modern features including fireproof concrete floors and a redundant boiler in case the primary boiler failed. Utilizing artifacts from the Branches' personal Renaissance collection, the house incorporated an Italian door and a carved wood gallery screen (or minstrel screen) from England. Until Beulah Gould Branch's death, almost every wall surface in the home's primary rooms was covered with the couple's collection of tapestries and textiles. The Branch Family John Kerr Branch was born in Danville, Virginia, to Mary Louise Merritt Kerr (1840–1896) and John Patteson Branch (1830–1915), both originally of Petersburg, Virginia. The elder Branch was a noted Richmond banker, investor, financier and philanthropist. On his death in 1915, The New York Times called him the \\"Nestor of Richmond Bankers.\\" John Kerr Branch grew up in Richmond and attended the McGuire School, subsequently studying in Paris and Germany (1882–1884). At age 21 he began clerking with his father's firm, Thomas Branch & Company. Branch invested successfully in real estate and railroads; ultimately inherited his family's banking fortune; and became director of the Continental Insurance Company of New York (chiefly involved with Southern cotton mills and railroads) and the Petersburg Savings and Insurance Company. He became President of Merchants National Bank of Richmond (having founded the bank in 1871); President of Thomas Branch and Company, later Branch & Company, (1837–1976); and President of Bankers and Brokers, Richmond. He was a member of the New York Stock Exchange and in addition to numerous Richmond clubs, also a member of the New York Yacht Club and the Downtown Association of New York. Branch met Beulah Frances Gould in Germany on a retreat in the Black Forest. Both Quakers, they married in 1886 at the Gould family's rural estate, Elmwood, at Quaker Hill, Pawling, New York, and subsequently had three children: John Akin (born 1887), Zayde Bancroft Branch (born 1891), and Louise Branch (born 1900). Branch had already begun a career as an avid collector at age 19, when he acquired two 16th-century chairs. He and his wife Beulah later became widely known as collectors of Italian Renaissance paintings, furniture, tapestries, woodwork and armour. For the design of their new home, they began working with the firm of John Russell Pope in 1914, well before the firm's noted commissions in Washington, D.C. At the time when the Branches commissioned the home, Pope's firm had just won the competition to design Richmond's Broad Street Train Station, just two blocks to the north on land owned by Branch's father near Monument Avenue's Jefferson Davis memorial. The elder Branch gifted an entire city block to his son and daughter on condition that they build their homes there. John Kerr built on one half of the block, and construction was complete in 1919 at a cost of $160,000, roughly the equivalent of $19 million in 2010. The Branches lived \\"seasonally,\\" maintaining Elmwood, their farm estate at Quaker Hill, Pawling, New York and later also acquiring a 15th-century Italian Renaissance villa near Florence (Villa Marsilio Ficino in Fiesole). Branch House was their winter home. John Kerr Branch died in Fiesole on July 1, 1930, at age 65 of bronchitis, and was buried in Richmond. Beulah Gould Branch continued to live in the home until her death in 1952. Their daughter, Zayde Branch Rennolds (Mrs. Edmond Addison Rennolds Sr.) subsequently gifted the home to a Richmond charity. A decade later, in the late 1960s, their granddaughter Zayde Rennolds Dotts (Mrs. Walter Dotts, Jr.) created the Monument Avenue Preservation Society to protect the surroundings of the home her grandparents had commissioned. Ownership succession and recent history In 1953, Branch House was given by Zayde Branch Rennolds (Mrs. Edmund Addison Rennolds Sr.), the daughter of Beulah and John Kerr Branch, to the Richmond Community Chest, which subsequently became the United Givers Fund, in turn becoming the Richmond office of the United Way. After Beulah Gould Branch's death and during the years 1957–1975, the house became known as the Branch Memorial House. By 1966, the house was occupied by a group of nine charities, including the United Way and the American Cancer Society. As the headquarters for the United Way of Greater Richmond, Branch House hosted numerous social events, meetings, and community activities, including the summer concert series of the Richmond Pops Band. In 1982, Robert E. Pogue of Richmond and his wife Janice W. Pogue of Richmond bought the house and set up the offices of Pogue & Associates, Inc., an insurance agency representing Northwestern Mutual. The Pogues subsequently donated a preservation easement to the Virginia Department of Historic Resources. In exchange for tax benefits, the easement stipulated that \\"no major changes (could) be made to the exterior or interior, in perpetuity.\\" In December 1983, the Pogues successfully applied to list Branch House on the National Register of Historic Places. During its use by the Pogues and Northwestern Mutual, the house was extensively rehabilitated and again made available for public events. By 1990, the insurance agency had outgrown the house and put it up for sale for an asking price of 2.5 million. In 2003, the Virginia Center for Architecture Foundation (VCAF), precursor to the Virginia Center for Architecture (VCA), purchased the landmark for $2 million, subsequently verifying historic preservation tax credits, coordinating work with the Virginia Department of Historic Resources, and undertaking a $2 million renovation. The renovation repaired flat sections of the complex roof system, repaired the leaded-glass casement windows, removed paint from its interior stonework, modernized the HVAC systems and brought the facility into compliance with the accessibility requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act. On April 1, 2005, the facility opened as a museum, incorporating galleries, shops and offices. Two large rooms, one a long gallery along the northern wall of the house and another the former living room, provide exhibit space. In addition to the museum, which is an affiliate of the International Confederation of Architectural Museums, Branch House accommodates the offices of the Virginia Society of the American Institute of Architects (VSAIA) and the Virginia Center for Architecture (VCA); the editorial office of VSAIA's publication, Inform magazine; a museum shop; as well as the main legal offices of Dominion General Counsel. A rare book shop, Collectors Old Book Shop, operates on the second floor, having relocated with VSAIA and VCAF when they moved from Barret House in Richmond. Beulah Gould Branch's bedroom now serves as the official boardroom of VCA and VSAIA. Branch House's original chapel room remains undeveloped. In 2013, the museum received a $250,000 gift from the Elwood Fund, administered by the descendants of John Kerr and Beulah Gould Branch. In 2014, the museum dedicated one of the facility's gallery's in honor of Zayde Branch Rennolds and in recognition of the 2013 Elwood Fund gift.

A medium-sized sparrow at , it has distinctive plumage, including large pale head stripes in both sexes. Its plumage is mostly grey, brown, and chestnut, and the male has some bold black and white markings on its head and neck. The species inhabits semi-arid savannah, cultivated areas, and towns, and ranges from the central coast of Angola to eastern South Africa and Swaziland. Three subspecies are distinguished in different parts of its range. Cape sparrows primarily eat seeds, and also eat soft plant parts and insects. They typically breed in colonies, and when not breeding they gather in large nomadic flocks to move around in search of food. The nest can be constructed in a tree, a bush, a cavity, or a disused nest of another species. A typical clutch contains three or four eggs, and both parents are involved in breeding, from nest building to feeding young. The Cape sparrow is common in most of its range and coexists successfully in urban habitats with two of its relatives, the native southern grey-headed sparrow and the house sparrow, an introduced species. The Cape sparrow's population has not been recorded decreasing significantly, and it is not seriously threatened by human activities, so it is assessed as a species of least concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).  Description  A male in Western Cape, seen from the front For a sparrow, the Cape sparrow is strikingly coloured and distinctive, and is medium-sized at long. Adults range in weight from . The breeding male has a mostly black head, but with a broad white mark on each side, curling from behind the eye to the throat. On the throat a narrow black band connects the black bib of the breast to black of the head. The underparts are greyish, darker on the flanks. The back of the male's neck is dark grey, and its back and shoulders are bright chestnut. The male has a white and a black wing bar below its shoulders, and flight feathers and tail streaked grey and black. The female is plumaged like the male, but is duller and has a grey head with a different pattern from the male, though it bears a hint of the pale head markings of the male. The juvenile is like the female, but young males have black markings on the head from an early age. The Cape sparrow's calls are chirps similar to those of the house sparrow, but much more musical and mellow. The basic call is used in flight and while perching socially and transcribed as chissip, chirrup, ', or '. A loud, distinctive call used by the male to advertise nest ownership can be written as tweeng or twileeng; this call can be extended into a jerky and repetitive song, chip cheerup, chip cheerup.  Taxonomy  The Cape sparrow was first taxonomically described by Philipp Ludwig Statius Müller in 1776, as Loxia melanura. Some other earlier biologists described the Cape sparrow in Loxia or Fringilla, but it has otherwise been regarded as a member of the genus Passer along with the house sparrow and other sparrows of the Old World. Within this genus, morphological comparisons and geography were insufficient to elucidate to which species the Cape sparrow is most closely related. Mitochondrial DNA phylogenies have strongly suggested that the Cape sparrow is among the most basal members of its genus, having diverged from the rest of the genus during the late Miocene, over 5 million years ago. It is genetically closest to the southern grey- headed sparrow and the other grey-headed sparrows of Africa and the saxaul sparrow of Central Asia, so these species may be sibling species of the Cape sparrow or similarly early offshoots. The Cape sparrow's specific epithet comes from the Greek μέλας (melas, \\"black\\") and ουρά (oura, \\"tail\\"), while the name of the genus Passer comes from a Latin word for small birds. The Cape sparrow has three subspecies. The nominate subspecies Passer melanurus melanurus is found in western South Africa, east to the western part of Free State. The subspecies vicinus, which is sometimes included in subspecies melanurus, occurs from Free State east to Eastern Cape and Lesotho. The subspecies damarensis ranges from the extreme southern coastal areas of Angola into Namibia, Botswana and southern Zimbabwe, as well as northern South Africa.  Distribution and habitat  Females drinking at a waterhole in Namibia The Cape sparrow inhabits southern Africa south of Angola and as far east as Swaziland. The northernmost point in its range is Benguela in Angola, and it is found in the coastal and central parts of Namibia, except for the driest parts of the Namib Desert. It occurs in all of South Africa except the farthest east, in southern Botswana and spottily in the Kalahari Basin of central Botswana. In the east, it breeds at a small number of localities in southeastern Zimbabwe. It has been recorded as a vagrant in Harare, in central Zimbabwe. The eastern limit of its range is reached in the wet forests of Limpopo and KwaZulu Natal, extending into the hills of western Swaziland. The original habitats of this species were the semi-arid savanna, thornveld, and light woodland typical of southern Africa. When settled agriculture arrived in its range about a thousand years ago, it adapted to cultivated land, and since the arrival of settlement, it has moved into towns. The Cape sparrow prefers habitats with an annual rainfall of less than , though in desert areas it is usually found near watercourses or watering holes. While it occurs in urban centres, it prefers parks, gardens, and other open spaces, and has a low reproductive success in more built-up areas. In towns, the Cape sparrow competes with both the native southern grey-headed sparrow and house sparrow, which was introduced to southern Africa in the 19th century. Since it is more established around humans in its range than either, it successfully competes with both species, though they may exclude it from nesting in holes. A survey by birdwatchers completed in 2000 found the Cape sparrow increasing in abundance in some suburban areas of South Africa (the northern Johannesburg area, and Pietermaritzburg) and decreasing in others (the southern Cape Town area). The house sparrow was reported decreasing in several urban areas, as it has in parts of Europe, declines which are attributed to factors including the increasing density of garden plantings and increases in predation.  Behaviour  = Social behaviour = Cape sparrows and a southern masked weaver at a bird feeder in Johannesburg during the winter The Cape sparrow is social, lives in flocks, and usually breeds in colonies. Away from settled areas it spends much of the year wandering nomadically, in flocks of up to 200 birds. In cultivated and built up areas, smaller flocks form where food is provided for livestock or birds. In such places, it associates with other seed-eating birds, such as the house sparrow, the Cape weaver, and weavers of the genus Euplectes. Birds from urban areas form large flocks seasonally and fly out to the nearby countryside to feed on ripening grain, returning at night to roost. Cape sparrows prefer to roost in nests, and while wandering outside of the breeding season, birds in uncultivated areas roost socially in old nests or dense bushes. In farmland and towns, Cape sparrows build special nests for roosting, lined more poorly than breeding nests but incorporating a greater quantity of insulating material. An unusual social behaviour has been described from Cape sparrows in Johannesburg. Groups of 20–30 birds separate from larger flocks and stand close together on the ground with tails on the ground and heads held high. These groups sometimes move in an unconcerted fashion by hopping slowly. Often birds will fly up and hover above the ground. During these gatherings birds are silent and are never antagonistic. This behaviour's significance is unknown, and it is not reported in any other sparrow species. = Feeding = Male Cape sparrow carrying food to feed young The Cape sparrow mostly eats seeds, foraging in trees and on the ground. The larger seeds of cereals, wild grasses, and other small plants are preferred, with wheat and khakiweed (Alternanthera caracasana) being favourites. Buds and soft fruits are also taken, causing considerable damage to agriculture. Insects are eaten, and nestlings seem to be fed exclusively on caterpillars. The Cape sparrow eats the soft shoots of plants, and probes in aloes for nectar, but these are not important sources of food. = Breeding =  Courtship and colonies  A pair in Johannesburg The Cape sparrow usually breeds in loose colonies of 50–100 birds. 10 to 20 percent of the breeding birds in each population nest away from colonies, for unknown reasons. The Cape sparrow is usually monogamous, but some records of a male and two females nesting and raising young in one nest have been made in Western Cape. It seems pairs are formed in the non-breeding flocks, but it is not known how pairs are formed, or if the pair bond is for life. Once ready to breed, newly mated pairs look for a suitable nesting site, spending mornings searching, and returning to their flock in the afternoon. Once a site has been selected, both birds begin to build their nest. Other pairs seeking a nest site join them, and in this manner a colony forms quickly. The courtship display is poorly recorded. Ornithologist J. Denis Summers-Smith observed a display in which the male hopped beside the female in a tree, drooping its wings and ruffling the chestnut-coloured feathers on its back. Groups of two or more males have been observed chasing a female. In the house sparrow a similar display exists, in which a female who is not ready to copulate is chased by her mate, who is joined by other males. It is not known if the display in the Cape sparrow has a similar significance. When ready to mate, the female crouches in solicitation and is mounted by the male. Instances of hybridisation with the house sparrow, the southern grey-headed sparrow, and captives or escapees of the Sudan golden sparrow have been reported.  Nesting  The Cape sparrow utilises a variety of nesting sites. Bushes and trees, especially acacias, seem to be preferred, and many nests may be built in a single tree. Holes and other covered sites are chosen less frequently. Nests have been recorded from the eaves of buildings, on creepers on walls, in holes in earth banks, and in holes in haystacks. Sometimes the Cape sparrow nests in the disused nests of other birds, such as weavers and swallows. Pairs that nest away from colonies usually choose low bushes or utility poles as nesting sites. Nests are placed at least a metre above the ground, and can be only a few centimetres apart in colonies. Only the nest and its very close vicinity are defended as a territory. Males defend their territory with threatening postures, and sometimes by fighting with bills on the ground. Nests built in the open are large and untidy domed structures, built of dry grass, twigs, and other plant materials. Any leaves or thorns present in a tree may be worked into the nest. In cavity nests, the hole is filled with a shapeless mass of grass with a cup of soft material containing the eggs on the inside. When the disused domed nests of weavers are used, they are given a soft lining. The nest entrance is on the side, and is sometimes extended into a short funnel. The male and the female construct the nest together, keeping close when finding material and weaving it together. The inside linings of Cape sparrow nests can incorporate large portions of aromatic leaves such as wolbossie (Helichrysum pumilio), thyme (Thymus vulgaris), and camphor (Cinnamomum). This consistent use of aromatics suggests that they have some purpose such as protection against parasites.  Eggs and young  A male feeding a fledgeling Clutches contain between two and six eggs, typically three or four. Variation in clutch size depends on the amount of food available for young birds. Presumably owing to the greater availability of food, clutches are larger during the peak of the breeding season, and in more southern latitudes of the Cape sparrow's range. Both birds of a pair incubate the eggs during the day, switching every ten or fifteen minutes. At night, only the female incubates the eggs, while the male roosts outside or in the nest. In pairs breeding outside of colonies, birds leave the nest to make room for their mates upon hearing their mates approaching. Among colonial pairs, the incubating bird waits until its partner arrives in the nest, to prevent other birds from entering the nest. Incubation seems to begin before the clutch is complete, and lasts 12–24 days. The young of a clutch hatch over two or three days and are brooded until their feathers develop and eyes open five days after hatching. The young are fed on insects until they fledge 16 to 25, typically 17, days after hatching. After this they are fed for one or two weeks. While feeding nestlings, the female is dominant over the male. Cape sparrows are among the main hosts of brood parasitism by the dideric cuckoo in southern Africa, and sometimes parasitise nests of their own species.  Relationships with humans  The Cape sparrow is an abundant and familiar bird of human habitations and cultivation in most of southern Africa. It is not believed to be threatened, and accordingly is listed as a species of least concern on the IUCN's Red List. It can be an agricultural pest, especially of grain cultivation and vineyards. When vineyards in the south-west Cape started letting weeds grow between vines to conserve moisture, around 1956, the Cape sparrow moved in. Cape sparrows quickly exhausted the seeds and started eating the grapes. The Cape sparrow is now a serious pest in vineyards. Vineyards are not an optimal habitat, and some populations have had such a low reproductive success that they could not be maintained without immigration. The Cape sparrow was featured on the lowest-denomination South African coin, from the farthing (¼-cent) in 1923 to the cent that ceased to be minted in 2002, with designs based on an original by George Kruger Gray. This was said to be because women interned at a concentration camp in Bethulie during the Boer War adopted a biblical quotation (from Matthew 10) as their motto: \\"Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.\\" It has also been featured on stamps from Lesotho and the Central African Republic.

'Billy' Shields (born 1979), better known by his stage name Jehst, is an English rapper and co-founder of hip hop label YNR Productions. Biography Born in Kent in 1979, Jehst spent his early childhood in Crowborough in Sussex before moving to Huddersfield where he went to Honley High School. After being admitted to the LSE in London for a degree in Social Anthropology & Law, Jehst subsequently dropped out due to an offer of a record deal and an opportunity to set up his own label. His debut release came in 1999 with the Premonitions EP on YNR Productions, which he co-founded with Leeds hip hop artist, Tommy Evans. His solo career extended further when he appeared on Task Force's EP Voice of the Great Outdoors (2000) with the track 'Cosmic Gypsies', which resulted in a longtime association with Low Life Records. The release of four 12\\" records on the same label soon followed, while at around the same time in 2002 Jehst was also a pivotal member of the seven-man group Champions of Nature, whose members included AM, Apollo, L. Dolo, Lewis Parker, Profound, and Supa T (a.k.a. The Sundragon). The group eventually released two EP's before disbanding, but not before the final release of the acclaimed album, The Return of the Drifter. Issued in June 2002, it was a double release with an accompanying 11-track CD of the same name. This was essentially a collection of previously released tracks and a cross-section of Jehst's work up to that point. Furthermore, Shields had begun collaborating with producers such as Evil Ed, Harry Love and Lewis Parker to further enhance his status as an established figure within the British hip hop scene. In 2003, he unveiled his debut album proper, Falling Down, which featured guest appearances from Lewis Parker, Supa T, Usmaan and Klashnekoff. Jehst's next solo instalment came in the form of the 2005 effort, Nuke Proof Suit. The following year saw Jehst's production project, Jehst Presents: Underworld Epics come to fruition. In 2007 The Mengi Bus Mixtape was released, accompanied by a string of live shows including a small run of shows in Australia. Shields has also released material under the name 'Billy Brimstone' on his own label, YNR; the same label responsible for many up and coming and established British hip hop artists. Jehst's next album The Dragon of an Ordinary Family was released in June 2011. The first single from the album, \\"Starting Over\\", was launched by a viral marketing video campaign in which a supposed Jehst fan recorded footage of the rapper appearing as a worker of the Post Office. 'Jehst Is My Postman' later turned out to be a PR stunt, as this recording was followed up by a music video of the single, featuring many other rappers dressed in a variety of costumes. Graffiti Prior to deciding to focus full-time on his music, Jehst was a founding member of the graffiti crew FSB (Full Scale Burners) in Halifax with Spymad, Reap and Misc (later extended to include Reakt and others). Whilst not the most prolific artist in the area due to his musical commitments, Jehst was considered a talented and accomplished wall writer for a short time and was highly influential on his peers. The influence of TCS (The Chemical Souls – another Halifax graf crew, pioneered by Spymad & including Jehst) is still evident in the graffiti around the Kirklees district today, and fresh Jehst dubs have shown up in spots around East London as recently as 2009.

The train operated on the Northeast Corridor from New York City and Washington, D.C. to 30th Street Station in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where it went east to Atlantic City. History The new service started service in May 1989, after Amtrak spent extra Northeast Corridor improvement funds to rehabilitate the 60.3 mile long Atlantic City Line from Philadelphia to Atlantic City. The train was designed to provide service to gamblers and vacationers. The train made a single local stop on the Atlantic City Line. Amtrak completely renovated the Lindenwold Station and it served as a stop until July 1994, when the local stop was changed to the new Cherry Hill station due to low ridership at Lindenwold. Amtrak also operated some through services from Atlantic City to Richmond, Virginia and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. In June 1990, Amtrak entered into a partnership with Midway Airlines to operate trains from Philadelphia International Airport to Atlantic City via SEPTA. However, the service was short-lived, as Midway Airlines went bankrupt in the summer of 1991. The Amtrak service to Atlantic City never hit its expected ridership levels. In another effort to gain more riders, service was extended to Springfield, Massachusetts and New Haven, Connecticut. Even then, most passengers traveled between New York and Philadelphia rather than continue on to Atlantic City. Amtrak also had to compete with a number of bus lines offering discounted rates at casinos. Although the trains were moderately successful, Amtrak still deemed that the poor showing of riders was not enough to warrant train service, and plans were made to discontinue the line. All Amtrak service to Atlantic City was discontinued after April 1, 1995.

It commonly affects horses, mules, and donkeys. It is caused by a virus of the genus Orbivirus belonging to the family Reoviridae. This disease can be caused by any of the nine serotypes of this virus. AHS is not directly contagious, but is known to be spread by insect vectors. Epidemiology AHS virus was first recorded south of the Sahara Desert in the mid-1600s, with the introduction of horses to southern Africa. The virus is considered endemic to the equatorial, eastern, and southern regions of Africa. Several outbreaks have occurred in the Equidae throughout Africa and elsewhere.CIDRAP >> African Horse Sickness AHS is known to be endemic in sub-Saharan Africa, and has spread to Morocco, the Middle East, India, and Pakistan. More recently, outbreaks have been reported in the Iberian Peninsula and Thailand. AHS has never been reported in the Americas, eastern Asia, or Australasia. Epidemiology is dependent on host-vector interaction, where cyclic disease outbreaks coincide with high numbers of competent vectors. The most important vector for AHS in endemic areas is the biting midge Culicoides imicola, which prefers warm, humid conditions. Larvae do not carry the virus, and long, cold winters are sufficient to break epidemics in nonendemic areas. Host The common hosts of this disease are horses, mules, donkeys, and zebras. However, elephants, camels, and dogs can be infected, as well, but often show no signs of the disease. Dogs usually contract the disease by eating infected horse meat, although a recent report has been made of the disease occurring in dogs with no known horse-meat ingestion. Transmission This disease is spread by insect vectors. The biological vector of the virus is the Culicoides (midges) species. However, this disease can also be transmitted by species of mosquitoes including Culex, Anopheles, and Aedes, and species of ticks such as Hyalomma and Rhipicephalus. Clinical signs Horses are the most susceptible host with close to 90%The Merck Veterinary Manual – African Horse Sickness – Clinical Findings and Lesions mortality of those affected, followed by mules (50%) and donkeys (10%). African donkeys and zebras very rarely display clinical symptoms, despite high virus titres in blood, and are thought to be the natural reservoir of the virus. AHS manifests itself in four different forms: Pulmonary form The peracute form of the disease is characterized by high fever, depression, and respiratory symptoms. The clinically affected animal has trouble breathing, starts coughing frothy fluid from nostril and mouth, and shows signs of pulmonary edema within four days. Serious lung congestion causes respiratory failure and results in death in under 24 hours. This form of the disease has the highest mortality rate. Cardiac form This subacute form of the disease has an incubation period longer than that of the pulmonary form. Signs of disease start at day 7–12 after infection. High fever is a common symptom. The disease also manifests as conjunctivitis, with abdominal pain and progressive dyspnea. Additionally, edema is presented under the skin of the head and neck, most notably in swelling of the supraorbital fossae, palpebral conjunctiva, and intermandibular space. Mortality rate is between 50 and 70%, and survivors recover in 7 days. Mild or horse sickness fever form Mild to subclinical disease is seen in zebras and African donkeys. Infected animals may have a low-grade fever and congested mucous membrane. The survival rate is 100%. Mixed form Diagnosis is made at necropsy. Affected horses show signs of both the pulmonary and cardiac forms of AHS. Diagnosis Presumptive diagnosis is made by characteristic clinical signs, post mortem lesions, and presence of competent vectors. Laboratory confirmation is by viral isolation, with such techniques as quantitative PCR for detecting viral RNA, antigen capture (ELISA), and immunofluorescence of infected tissues. Serological tests are only useful for detecting recovered animals, as sick animals die before they are able to mount effective immune responses. Treatment and prevention No treatment for AHS is known. Control of an outbreak in an endemic region involves quarantine, vector control, and vaccination. To prevent this disease, the affected horses are usually slaughtered, and the uninfected horses are vaccinated against the virus. Three vaccines currently exist, which include a polyvalent vaccine, a monovalent vaccine, and a monovalent inactivated vaccine. This disease can also be prevented by destroying the insect vector habitats and by using insecticides. History African horse sickness was diagnosed in Spain in 1987–90 and in Portugal in 1989, but was eradicated using slaughter policies, movement restrictions, vector eradication, and vaccination. Probable infection was reported in Pak Chong district of Nakhon Ratchasima province in Thailand in March 2020 when 42 racehorses died from an unknown illness (to be confirmed).https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/1887870/deadly-virus- kills-42-racehorses-in-korat#cxrecs_s Related diseases AHS is related to bluetongue disease and is spread by the same midge (Culicoides species).

It is popular in Middle East, East African and North African countries and is called “Saluyot” in the Philippines. Mulukhiyah is rather bitter, and when boiled, the resulting liquid is a thick, highly mucilaginous broth; it is often described as \\"slimy\\", rather like cooked okra. Mulukhiyah is generally eaten cooked, not raw, and is most frequently turned into a kind of soup or stew, typically bearing the same name as the vegetable in the local language. Traditionally mulukhiyah is cooked with chicken or at least chicken stock for flavor and is served with white rice, accompanied with lemon or lime. Origins  While most scholars are of the opinion that mulukhiya's origins lie in Ancient Egypt, there is evidence that India is the source of the related species Corchorus capsularis, which is also used for food as well as fiber. Greek : molokha. =Egyptian cuisine= As used in Egyptian cuisine, ' () is prepared by removing the central spine from the leaves, and then chopping the leaves finely with garlic and coriander. The dish generally includes some sort of meat; in Egypt this is usually poultry such as chicken, or rabbit, but lamb is preferred when available, particularly in Cairo. Cooks in Alexandria often opt to use shrimp in the soup, while Port Said is famous for using fish. ' was consumed in ancient Egyptian cuisine, where the name \\"\\" is thought to have originated from. Many Egyptians consider to be the national dish of Egypt, along with ful medames and kushari. ;Preparation The Egyptian version differs in texture and preparation from the Syrian/Lebanese version. The molokhiya leaves are picked off the stem, with tall stemmed branches, and the leaves placed on a large sheet (cloth material) to be left to completely dry for later use. ;Cooking The leaves are chopped fine, often with a mezzaluna. The leaves are then boiled in broth with large chunks of meat, such as boneless chicken, rabbit, beef or lamb (with bone). Coriander and garlic are fried separately in ghee to make the \\"ta'leyya\\", and then added to the soup at the end while the ta'leyya is still sizzling named tashsha, to create a characteristic sound which for fun some people traditionally respond to with the shah'a ( sudden breath ) . ;Serving The soup is served on white rice or with a side of Egyptian flatbread (ʿeish baladi). The dish is often accompanied with an assortment of pickled vegetables, known as mekhallel or torshi in Egypt. =Levantine cuisine= Levantine style Mlokhia The standard molokhia dish in the Levant is prepared by cooking a meat of some sort in a separate pot by boiling. Later onions and garlic are cooked to a simmer, then water and chicken stock cubes are added to form a broth. After boiling, the cooked chicken or meat and molokhia leaves are added and further cooked another 15 minutes. Also, in northern Lebanon, a dish called mloukhiye b zeit is made using fresh leaves and shoots of the Nalta jute plant, cooked in olive oil, onions, garlic, tomatoes and chilli peppers; it is a popular summer side dish, especially in Miniyeh-Danniyeh and Akkar districts. Bedouins have an old tradition of cooking a different version of the dish. A whole chicken is cut open, the intestines removed, and the innards stuffed with herbs, spices and raw rice then sewn shut with thick thread. The chicken is then boiled to create the broth for the molokhia soup which, after preparation, is served as five separate components: The molokhia soup, Arabic flat bread, the chicken (stuffed with flavored rice), additional plain rice, and a small bowl with a mixture of lemon juice and sliced chilli. The soup is mixed with rice and lemon juice according to taste, while the chicken is eaten on a separate plate. =Kenyan cuisine= In Kenya, the dish is known as murere (Luhya), murenda, apoth (Luo), and several other native language names. It is a very popular vegetable dish among communities in the Western region (Vihiga, Kakamega, Busia, Trans Nzoia and Bungoma Counties) and in Nyanza region (Kisumu, Siaya, Homa Bay, Kisii, Migori and Nyamira Counties). Both regions are in the area around Lake Victoria. The jute leaves are separated from the stems, washed, and then boiled in lightly salted water with ligadi (a raw form of soda (bicarbonate of soda), or munyu (traditional plant-based salt). The leaves are boiled with other leafy vegetables such as likuvi (Vigna unguiculata (cowpea) leaves) or mito (Chipilín) to reduce their sliminess and help soften the other vegetable leaves. In some cases, after boiling for about thirty minutes, the vegetables are stewed with tomatoes and onions in oil. (There are several general ways to prepare the mutere and more ways in which it is served). Spices such as curry, pepper, masala, or coriander are optional. Mutere is served with ugali (a staple stuff, cooked cereal meal) and can be accompanied with meat or chicken. =Tunisian cuisine= Tunisian mloukhiya stew with meat. In Tunisia, the dish is generally prepared quite differently from the Egyptian method. The leaves, already separated from the stems, are dried then ground to produce a very fine powder and stored in jars or other tightly closed containers. In Tunisian cooking, mulukhya, or mloukhiya, takes 5 to 7 hours to prepare, which is often done to halfway in the evening and completed in the morning. The powder is prepared with olive oil and some tomato paste into a sauce, not soup, and big chunks of chuck beef are often added halfway through cooking. The dark green sauce simmers on low heat and is left to thicken to the consistency of tomato sauce. The sauce is served in small deep plates with a piece of beef and eaten with preferably white hearty French or Italian bread. In certain regions where beef is not common, lamb is used but cooks for a much shorter time. =Cypriot cuisine= In Northern Cyprus the dish is known as molohiya. It is popular among the Turkish Cypriots. The jute leaves are cultivated and grown in the spring, whereupon they are harvested and the leaves are separated from the stem and dried whole. They are cooked in a tomato-based broth with onions and garlic. Lamb on the bone or chicken with bone may also be added. For optimal results, lemon and potato are also used to help keep the consistency from becoming too mucilaginous or slimy. It is served with a broth consistency with sourdough bread. =West African cuisines= The leaf is a common food in many tropical West African countries. It is believed that the \\"drip tips\\" on the leaves serve to shed excess water from the leaf from the heavy rains in the tropics. In Sierra Leone it is called kren-kre (krain krain or crain crain), and is eaten in a palm oil sauce served with rice or cassava fufu (a traditional food made from cassava), or else is steamed and mixed into rice just before eating a non-palm oil sauce. Among the Yorubas in south-west Nigeria, it is called ewedu and served with cooked yam flour (amala). In Liberia it is called palaver sauce, and is served with rice or fufu. In The Gambia it is referred to as kereng-kereng and is typically used to make supakanja (a dish mostly served on Saturdays and made with okra, red palm oil, fish and meat). In Ghana, it is known as Ademe ewe or Ayoyo leaves and used to make accompanying soups for Banku(a corn cassavas dough dish) or cooked rice). = Haitian cuisines = In Haiti, the leafy green dish is commonly known as lalo and is traditionally cooked with or without meat. When considering meat, Haitians utilize beef or pork shoulder. Seafood such as blue crabs, shrimp or snow crab legs are also options. It is traditionally served with white rice.  Nutrition  The leaves are rich in folate, beta-carotene, iron, calcium, vitamin C and more than 32 vitamins, minerals and trace elements. The plant has a potent antioxidant activity with a significant α-tocopherol equivalent vitamin E. Ancient references The word for the plant is found in ancient Mediterranean languages such as Arabic and Greek. Cognates of the word include Ancient Greek μαλάχη (malákhē) or μολόχη (molókhē), Modern Greek μολόχα (molókha), modern (mulukhiyah) and modern (malukhia).

They were known for serving, among other things, \\"Fat Sandwiches,\\" a sub roll containing a combination of ingredients such as burgers, cheese, chicken fingers, french fries, falafel, and mozzarella sticks. In August 2004, Maxim Magazine's top sandwich in the nation was awarded to the \\"Fat Darrell,\\" a sandwich invented by a student named Darrell Butler and commonly served by these trucks. Grease trucks were an integral part of campus culture, serving as a meeting and hangout spot. Grease trucks were named the number one post game activity in the country by Sports Illustrated On Campus in 2005, despite being located on the opposite side of the Raritan River from the Rutgers football stadium. Grease trucks were removed from their long time location in August 2013, with plans to be relocated throughout the New Brunswick and Piscataway campuses. History Starting in the early 1980s, food trucks licensed by the city of New Brunswick parked along College Avenue, most clustered near Voorhees Mall, where there is a high concentration of classroom buildings on the campus. A few were as far north as Brower Commons, about a quarter mile away (thus competing with eateries in the student center and dining hall). Students and visitors could obtain a quick, hot, inexpensive meal during events and between classes. The trucks became known as \\"grease trucks\\" due to the popularity of the fried foods they served. A nearby Somerset Street greasy spoon restaurant, \\"Greasy Tony's,\\" closed by eminent domain in the early 1990s to build University Center at Easton Ave, was part of the local popularity of food- related \\"grease\\"-based names of the time. Since fresh food was prepared on the trucks, they required power for refrigeration, and therefore either idled or ran gasoline generators. In the early 1990s, in an effort to reduce the noise, pollution and visual blight along College Avenue, as the trucks obstructed the view of Voorhees Mall, the trucks were prohibited from parking along the thoroughfare, and Rutgers provided a corner of a faculty parking lot (#8) across the street. The vendors were put under contract with the university, which provided the trucks with space and electricity. Some trucks were open during the day, and others in the evening, with a couple of hours of overlap around dinner time. The trucks would rotate positions within the lot monthly, so that no one vendor would receive a competitive advantage based on location. At the time of the move, the university planned for a courtyard setting in the lot with benches and tables to create a friendly, aesthetic environment, but these plans did not come to fruition for nearly twenty years. Grease trucks, coincidentally located next to Union Street, the home of the majority of Rutgers' fraternity and sorority houses, were originally open 24 hours a day at this location, and shortly after the local bars closed would become a site for many hungry customers and a sort of after party. The parking lot became strewn with garbage, and there were complaints of frequent fighting, noise and public urination. A closing time of 3 A.M. was mandated in 1996 to coincide with the bar closings, and two years later was changed to 2 A.M., when the bar closing time was altered by the city. In the early 2000s, several trucks were bought out and consolidated to a single fixed food trailer called \\"The Scarlet Shack\\" at the center of the remaining trucks, as seen in the photograph above. Features such as phone and internet orders, acceptance of credit cards and the Rutgers University food card (RU Express) were added over the years, as well as an ATM. In August 2013, the trucks were removed from parking lot #8 where they had been for twenty years to make way for a new building. The university planned to relocate the trucks to various locations on the College Avenue, Busch, Livingston, and Douglass campuses. Fat Sandwiches and other cuisine A parody of the pre-2007 official Rutgers logo. Typical grill fare is available at grease trucks, but most popular are the \\"fat\\" sandwiches composed of permutations of various foods, such as burgers, French fries (in the sandwich), cheesesteak, mozzarella sticks, chicken fingers, pork rolls, marinara sauce, falafel, gyro meat, bacon, fried eggs, ketchup, mayonnaise, onions, etc. They supposedly originated in the 1970s when a local restaurant served a sandwich called the \\"Fat Cat\\" consisting of two cheeseburgers, French fries, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise and ketchup, all combined, on a bun. In the 1980s, the Fat Cat became a popular item at grease trucks. The three other Fat sandwiches sold during the early history of grease trucks were the \\"Fat Moon\\" (chicken fingers, bacon, egg, french fries, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise and ketchup), \\"Fat Koko\\" (pizza steak, french fries, mozzarella sticks), and \\"Fat Sam\\" (cheese steak, grilled chicken, french fries, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, and ketchup). These inexpensive sandwiches (originally only $1 more than a regular hamburger) with the \\"sides\\" included within steadily rose in popularity, but the \\"Fat Cat\\" would remain the top seller until 1997, when a student named Darrell W. Butler created the \\"Fat Darrell\\" consisting of chicken fingers, mozzarella sticks, French fries, and marinara sauce. Butler told USA Today, \\"Like the typical college student, I was pretty much broke. I had been craving chicken fingers, mozzarella sticks and French fries all week long but I knew that I didn't have enough money to buy all three. I talked the guy behind the counter into putting them all onto a piece of bread for me. I guess it sounded like a good idea because the next 10 or so people all asked for the same thing.\\" Since the creation of the \\"Fat Darrell,\\" dozens of additional Fat Sandwich combinations have been composed, mostly by customer suggestions. Many combinations of available ingredients have been created, including multiple vegetarian options. Fat sandwiches have become available in many short-order eateries and pizza places in and around New Brunswick. With popularity spreading beyond the region, and with nationwide media recognition, fat sandwich vendors are popping up on various college campuses around the country. Grease trucks were the featured location in episode 19 of Man v. Food, season 2. Host Adam Richman attempted the \\"Fat Sandwich Challenge\\" at the R.U. Hungry? truck, in which eating five fat sandwiches in 45 minutes allows you to name a new sandwich on the menu, but he was able to finish only 4½ in the timeframe. Grease trucks are also notable for offering many types of mostly home-made Mediterranean food, such as gyros, falafel, and hummus, on pita bread. Also, occasionally or formerly available are baba ghanouj, stuffed grape leaves, Mujaddara, and spinach pies. These choices came about because many of the vendors had come from Middle Eastern countries such as Lebanon and Egypt. These homemade healthier options were welcome for those not desiring the large number of calories which accompany fried foods. Other commonly available items include eggs, soup, gum, chips, cookies, muffins, and even homemade Rice Krispies Treats. As some trucks are open in the morning, breakfast grill items and bagels are also often available. =Controversies= Sandwiches with colorful names such as the \\"Fat Balls,\\" \\"Fat Bitch\\" and \\"Fat Philipino\\" ; were deemed offensive by Rutgers, and in 2005 the vendors agreed to change the names on the posted menus (e.g., \\"Fat Bulls,\\" \\"Fat Beach\\" \\"Fat Philly\\" etc.) to maintain their contracts to do business on Rutgers property. Some students expressed outrage at the university's censorship, but others defended the logic behind the request for name changes. Dietitian pundit Marcus Garand has pointed out the Fat Sandwich's general unhealthiness: a \\"Fat Darrell\\" for instance, has about 1,718 calories, 143 grams of carbohydrates and 78 grams of fat. Garand stated, \\"This sandwich is like a nutritionist's worst nightmare. I couldn't figure out a way to make it any unhealthier. ... This is probably the unhealthiest sandwich you could ever devise.\\" Auman, Greg. \\"And . . . Rutgers gets stuffed again\\", St. Pete Times, November 4, 2005.

Its initial autonomy was further amplified with the Yugoslav constitution of 1974, which devolved greater power to the various republic level branches. History In 1989 Slovenia passed amendments to its constitution that asserted its sovereignty over the federation and its right to secede. These amendments were bitterly opposed by the leadership of Serbia under Slobodan Milošević. On 23 January 1990, the Slovene delegation, headed by Milan Kučan, left the Party Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, leading to the collapse of the all-Yugoslav party. On 4 February 1990 the League of Communists of Slovenia changed its name to the Party of Democratic Reform (Stranka demokratične prenove - SDP), and shortly afterwards began negotiations with the Democratic Opposition of Slovenia for the establishment of a multi-party system. In April 1990, the reformed Communists lost the elections to the DEMOS coalition. In 1992, they ceased to be the largest left wing party and entered a period of radical transformation, which gained momentum with the election of Borut Pahor as the party chairman.

A chunky little seed-eating bird with a thick bill, it has a body length of . Its plumage is mainly warm rufous above and grey below. It exhibits sexual dimorphism, with the plumage of both sexes patterned similarly to that of the corresponding sex of house sparrow. Its vocalisations are sweet and musical chirps, which when strung together form a song. Three subspecies are recognised, differing chiefly in the yellowness of their underparts. The subspecies rutilans and intensior breed in parts of eastern Asia, where they are usually found in light woodland, and the subspecies cinnamomeus breeds in the Himalayas, where it is usually associated with terrace cultivation. The russet sparrow is the typical sparrow of human habitations in towns where the house and Eurasian tree sparrows are absent. In the southern part of its range, the russet sparrow prefers higher altitudes, but in the north it breeds by the sea. The russet sparrow is known well enough in the Himalayas to have a distinct name in some languages, and is depicted in Japanese art. This sparrow feeds mainly on the seeds of herbs and grains, but it also eats berries and insects, particularly during the breeding season. This diet makes it a minor pest in agricultural areas, but also a predator of insect pests. While breeding, it is not social, as its nests are dispersed. It forms flocks when not breeding, although it associates with other bird species infrequently. In some parts of its range, the russet sparrow migrates, at least to lower altitudes. Its nest is located in a tree cavity, or a hole in a cliff or building. The male chooses the nest site before finding a mate and uses the nest for courtship display. The typical clutch contains five or six whitish eggs. Both sexes incubate and feed the young.  Taxonomy  The English ornithologist John Gould described a specimen of the russet sparrow collected in the Himalayas at a meeting of the Zoological Society of London in December 1835 under the binomial name Pyrgita cinnamomea. His description was included in the volume of the society's proceedings for 1835 that was published on 8 April 1836. Dated 1835 on the title page but published in 1836. Its specific name comes from the New Latin cinnamomeus, \\"cinnamon-coloured\\". The russet sparrow was described as Fringilla rutilans, by the Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck, from a specimen collected in Japan. The 5 volumes were originally issued in 102 parts, 1820-1839 Temminck's description is contained in his Nouveau recueil de planches coloriées d'oiseaux which was issued in 102 livraisons or parts between 1820 and 1839. It was at one time believed that the livraison containing the description of the russet sparrow was issued in 1835 but it has now been established that it appeared sometime in 1836 but as the precise date is not known under the rules of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature it is deemed to have been published on 31 December 1836. Most taxonomists give priority to Gould's publication and use the binomial name Passer cinnamomeus for the russet sparrow. The russet sparrow has usually been placed in the genus Passer, and within this genus it is seen as a part of the \\"Palearctic black-bibbed sparrow\\" group, which includes the Eurasian tree sparrow as well as the house sparrow. It has generally been seen as a close relation of the house sparrow, and Richard Meinertzhagen even considered it to be the same species as the Somali sparrow, one of the house sparrow's closest relatives. However, studies of mitochondrial DNA indicate that the russet sparrow is an early offshoot or basal species among the Palearctic black-bibbed sparrows. While mitochrondrial DNA suggests speciation in Passer occurred during the Miocene and Pliocene, British ornithologist J. Denis Summers-Smith estimated that the russet sparrow separated from the other Palearctic black-bibbed sparrows about 25,000 to 15,000 years ago, during the last glacial period. During this time, sparrows would have been isolated in ice-free refugia, such as the lower Yangtze valley, which Summers-Smith considered the most likely centre of evolution for the russet sparrow. Thirteen subspecies have been described, but only three are widely recognised, these differing largely in the colour of their underparts. The subspecies Passer cinnamomea rutilans breeds in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and southeastern and central China. The subspecies intensior, described in 1922 by Walter Rothschild from Yunnan, breeds in southwest China and parts of India, Burma, Laos, and Vietnam. In a large part of Sichuan intensior intergrades with P. c. rutilans, and a number of subspecies names have been proposed for the intergrades. The nominate subspecies cinnamomeus, described by Gould from the northwestern Himalayas, breeds from northern Arunachal Pradesh to Nuristan in Afghanistan.  Description  The russet sparrow is a small chunky bird, with plumage warm rufous in overall colour. It is a medium-sized sparrow at and . It has a thick bill suited to eating seeds, which is black on the breeding male, horn-coloured on the non-breeding male, and yellowish with a dark tip on the female. Wingspans for males range between and those for females from . Tail, bill, and tarsus lengths are , , and , respectively. Measurements for the russet sparrow vary geographically, between the three subspecies, and also within the Himalayan subspecies cinnamomeus. The subspecies cinnamomeus is generally larger than the others, and within this form there is a tendency for birds at higher altitudes to be larger, and a clinal variation in size with the smallest birds in the west of the range and the largest in the east. The iris is chestnut in colour. The legs of both sexes are pale brown to pinkish- brown. The flight of all sparrows is swift, and that of the russet sparrow is described as swifter and more direct than that of the Eurasian tree sparrow. = Plumage = An illustration by Philipp Franz von Siebold from Fauna Japonica, in which the russet sparrow was described with the now synonymised name Passer russatus The sexes differ, or are dimorphic, in their plumage, and have a similar pattern to that in the corresponding sex of house sparrow. There is some variation between the three subspecies, especially in the colouration of the underparts. Birds of the subspecies rutilans are off-white on their cheeks and the sides of their necks, and have pale grey underparts. Birds of the subspecies intensior have a pale yellow wash on their underparts and cheeks, as well as darker upperparts, while those of the subspecies cinnamomeus have a heavy yellow tinge to their underparts. Moult is poorly recorded, the only records coming from Sakhalin and Himachal Pradesh. In Sakhalin, moult occurs in August and September, between the breeding season and migration. In Himachal Pradesh, aviculturalist G. A. Perreau observed captive and wild birds and reported that they were yellow from December to spring and whitish during the remainder of the year, a pattern which may be atypical. The breeding male is bright russet or cinnamon red on its upperparts from its crown to its rump, with a black streaking on its mantle. It has a small black bib and black around its eye, separated from the russet of its crown by a very thin white supercilium, a stripe running from the bill to the rear of the head. The side of its neck and cheek are off-white, and its underparts are pale grey or washed with yellow, varying geographically. Shoulders and greater coverts are chestnut, and its median coverts are black at the base with white at the tips. The rest of the wing is light brown with black tinges. Its tail is blackish brown, edged with ashy brown. The non- breeding male differs little from the breeding male, being paler with more orange upperparts. The only species with which the male is easily confused is the Eurasian tree sparrow, which differs in its black cheek spot and brown back. The female has mostly pale brown upperparts, and pale grey underparts, so it resembles the female house sparrow. It differs from the house sparrow in its slightly darker, russet-tinged plumage. It has a conspicuous cream supercilium from above its eye nearly around its head, and a bold dark brown stripe through its eye. It has mostly greyish brown wings and a back streaked with black and buff. The juvenile is similar to the female, though more pale and sandy. As the male reaches its first winter, it resembles the adult, differing in less bold chestnut and a dusky bib. = Voice = The russet sparrow's vocalisations are described by most sources as \\"the sweetest and most musical\\" of any sparrow. Its basic call is a ' or ', similar to that of other sparrows. This call is monosyllabic, unlike the house sparrow's chirrup call, and is softer than that of the other sparrows. This call is given as a flight call, or by displaying males. Recorded variations include a ' given by males at the nest and a trilled '. Sometimes the male strings calls together and sings them in a strident tone, to create a sort of short song, transcribed as ' or '. The song is interspersed with sibilant ' notes similar to those of the white wagtail. A thin ' vocalisation not unlike that of an Indian robin has been reported, but the context of this call is unrecorded. During territorial disputes, males give a rapid ' call.  Distribution and habitat  Breeding male in Kullu, India A wintering flock of russet sparrows in Murree, Pakistan The russet sparrow is found in parts of eastern Asia and in the Himalayas. It is not known whether its distribution is continuous between these two areas, since the political sensitivity of the Brahmaputra River's valley near the China-India border makes the area less accessible to ornithologists. In the Himalayas the russet sparrow breeds from the far northeast of India through southeastern Tibet, Bhutan, Sikkim, Nepal, Uttarakhand, and Himachal Pradesh to Kashmir and Nuristan in Afghanistan. Here, the russet sparrow makes short movements to lower altitudes between November and April in many areas. In eastern Asia, the russet sparrow is found in Sakhalin, the Kuril Islands, a small part of mainland Russia, Japan, southern Korea, and part of northern China, where it is mostly migratory. It is distributed through southern China and Taiwan, and the mountainous parts of Burma, southern Northeast India, Laos, and Vietnam, where it is mostly resident. The russet sparrow also occurs as a winter visitor in southern Japan, the further south of China, and northern Thailand. In eastern Asia, the autumn migration occurs between August and November. The russet sparrow appears to be abundant in most habitats across most of its very large range, and in the some areas it is among the most common birds. In Southeast Asia, its range has contracted at lower elevations due to global warming, but it has also moved higher at high elevations and it remains common. Although its global population has not been quantified, it is assessed for the IUCN Red List as least concern for global extinction. Breeding takes place in mountains and uplands across most of the range. This preference for high altitudes is influenced by latitude: in the farthest south of its range it never breeds below above mean sea level, but in the northernmost part of its range it often breeds by the sea. In eastern Asia, the russet sparrow prefers light woodland, but it is sometimes found in towns and agricultural areas. In Sakhalin, it breeds mostly in riparian forest. In Hokkaidō, the russet sparrow finds a greater food supply for its young in more remote forests, and has greater reproductive success. In the Himalayas, it is strongly associated with terrace cultivation, and it probably only spread to the Himalayas when these agricultural practices arrived 3000 to 4000 years ago. In towns where it occurs alongside the house or tree sparrow, it is found in gardens and less built up areas. In those hill stations in India where both the house and the russet sparrow occur, the house sparrow breeds around more-built up areas and bazaars, whereas the russet sparrow is \\"rather more up market at the larger houses with gardens and open spaces\\". In towns where it is the only sparrow, it is not dependent on trees, breeding around houses and eating scraps in streets. In the winter, migratory birds occur in open cultivated land and riverine grasslands, but are never far from shrubs or trees.  Behaviour  A male eating Yoshino cherry blossoms, in Aichi Prefecture, Japan In many aspects of its behaviour, the russet sparrow is similar to the house and Eurasian tree sparrows. Like them, it feeds on the ground, but spends most of its time perching on branches. Unlike those species, it prefers open, exposed branches for perching. The russet sparrow is described as shy and wary by some observers, but J. Denis Summers-Smith found it approachable in Indian hill stations. Flocking russet sparrows feed close to the ground, moving forward as birds from the rear of a flock move to the front, in what is called \\"roller feeding\\". Outside its breeding season, the russet sparrow is gregarious and forms flocks to find food, though it infrequently associates with other birds. Wintering flocks tend to keep away from human habitation. The russet sparrow is also social at night during the winter, and it forms large communal roosts in trees and bushes. In the breeding season, the female roosts in the nests and the male nests in foliage nearby. The adult russet sparrow is mostly a seed-eater, eating the seeds of herbs and weeds as well as rice, barley, and other grains. Berries, such as those of the kingore (certain Berberis spp.), are also eaten when available. Nestlings are fed mostly on insects, especially caterpillars and larval beetles obtained on trees and flying insects caught by aerial pursuit. During the breeding season adults also consume insects. Mortality rates in the russet sparrow have not been studied, but it is known that many young birds die from Isospora infections, to which the bird has little resistance. Other recorded parasites of the russet sparrow include Protocalliphora blowflies, and Menacanthus chewing lice. = Breeding = The russet sparrow's breeding season is short, lasting about three months. The Himalayan subspecies cinnamomeus has been recorded breeding from April to August, the nominate subspecies breeds from May to July, and the subspecies intensior is believed to breed in March. During its breeding season, the russet sparrow is not gregarious, and its nests are dispersed uniformly rather than clustered. Its nests are most frequently built in tree cavities, often disused woodpecker nests. The russet sparrow has been recorded breeding alongside the Eurasian tree sparrow and white wagtail in black kite nests, taking advantage of the territorial defence of the kites to avoid nest predation. Other nest locations include the eaves of thatched roofs, stone walls and embankments, and electric junction boxes. In Bhutan, it nests in holes in the outer walls of monasteries, often alongside the Eurasian tree sparrow. In Sakhalin, it will sometimes build free-standing nests in bushes. The russet sparrow also uses the disused nests of the red-rumped swallow, and a pair of russet sparrows has been recorded attempting to oust a pair of black-crested tits from their nest. The male chooses the nest site, and uses it for his courtship display, spending much time calling nearby. When a female comes near a male at his nest the male begins to display by raising his head, drooping his wings, pushing his chest forward, and lowering his tail. He then bows up and down in front of the female, who will lunge and then fly away if unreceptive. Both sexes take part in building the nest, which consists of a loose, untidy bunch of dry grass which fills the nesting cavity, lined with fur and feathers for warmth. Eggs are elongated ovals, with a fine texture and a slight gloss. They are whitish in overall colour with a grey tinge and brown spots, streaks, or blotches. The average size of the egg is 19.2×14.2 millimetres (0.75×0.55 in). Eggs are similar to those of the Eurasian tree sparrow, differing in a duller colour and more narrow shape, though they cannot be separated from those of the other sparrows with certainty. Two clutches of four or sometimes five or six eggs are laid in a year. In Hokkaidō, clutches are laid between early May and early July, with two peaks in laying around mid May and late June. Both sexes incubate and feed the young, with the male often being more active in feeding the nestlings. In Hokkaidō, nestlings hatch weighing about , and fledge fourteen or fifteen days after hatching, weighing . The common cuckoo has been recorded in old literature as a brood parasite of the russet sparrow.  Relationships with humans  The c. 1830 woodblock \\"Hibiscus and Sparrow\\" by the Japanese artist alt=An artwork with a red-capped and reddish-backed little bird flying beside the pink five-petalled blooms and dark green leaves of a hibiscus flower In parts of the range, the russet sparrow inhabits towns, and in most of its range, it occurs near cultivation, and is a minor pest of agriculture. Though it damages crops, it also feeds its nestlings largely on insect pests. In China, the russet sparrow has been recorded as a captive bird, kept with the Eurasian tree sparrow. In Japan it was eaten in the 1870s and sold in the Yokohama game market. The russet sparrow is known well enough in the Himalayas that in most languages it has a different vernacular name from the Eurasian tree sparrow. Examples of these vernacular names include lal gouriya in Hindi and kang-che-go-ma in Tibetan. The Japanese artist Hokusai portrayed the russet sparrow, and due to this, it has appeared on postage stamps featuring Japanese art in Japan, The Gambia, and Guyana.

Meaning in philosophy The term originates with René Descartes in the form of the word apercevoir in his book Traité des passions. Leibniz introduced the concept of apperception into the more technical philosophical tradition, in his work Principes de la nature fondés en raison et de la grâce; although he used the word practically in the sense of the modern attention, by which an object is apprehended as \\"not-self\\" and yet in relation to the self. This cites: *Karl Lange, Ueber Apperception (6th ed. revised, Leipzig, 1899; trans. E. E. Brown, Boston, 1893) *G. F. Stout, Analytic Psychology (London, 1896), bk. ii. ch. viii. Immanuel Kant distinguished transcendental apperception from empirical apperception. The first is the perception of an object as involving the consciousness of the pure self as subject—\\"the pure, original, unchangeable consciousness that is the necessary condition of experience and the ultimate foundation of the unity of experience.\\" The second is \\"the consciousness of the concrete actual self with its changing states\\", the so- called \\"inner sense.\\" (Otto F. Kraushaar in RunesRunes, Dagobert D. (ed.), Dictionary of Philosophy, Littlefield, Adams, and Company, Totowa, NJ, 1972.). Transcendental apperception is almost equivalent to self-consciousness; the existence of the ego may be more or less prominent, but it is always involved. See Kantianism. The German philosopher Theodor Lipps distinguished the terms perception and apperception in his 1902 work, Vom Fühlen, Wollen und Denken.Lipps, Theodor. Vom Fuehlen, Wollen und Denken. Leipzig, Verlag von Johann Ambrosius Barth, 1902. See pages 6-7. Perception, for Lipps, is a generic term that covers such psychic occurrences as auditory and tactile sensations, recollections, visual representations in memory, etc. But these perceptions do not always hold our conscious attention - perception is not always consciously noticed. Lipps uses the term apperception, then, to refer to attentive perception, wherein, in addition to merely perceiving an object, either one also consciously attends to the perceived object or one also attends to the very perception of the object.Judgement and Truth in Early Analytic Philosophy and Phenomenology. ed. Mark Textor. Springer, 2013. pp. 14f. Meaning in psychology In psychology, apperception is \\"the process by which new experience is assimilated to and transformed by the residuum of past experience of an individual to form a new whole.\\" In short, it is to perceive new experience in relation to past experience. The term is found in the early psychologies of Herbert Spencer, Hermann Lotze, and Wilhelm Wundt. It originally means passing the threshold into consciousness, i.e., to perceive. But the percept is changed when reaching consciousness due to the contextual presence of the other stuff already there, thus it is not perceived but apperceived. According to Johann Friedrich Herbart apperception is that process by which an aggregate or \\"mass\\" of presentations becomes systematized (apperceptions-system) by the accretion of new elements, either sense-given or product of the inner workings of the mind. He thus emphasizes in apperception the connection with the self as resulting from the sum of antecedent experience. Hence in education the teacher should fully acquaint himself with the mental development of the pupil, in order that he may make full use of what the pupil already knows. The apperception notion was also looked into by A. Adler, on the basis of which he explains certain principles of perception. A child perceives different situations not as they actually exist, but by means of the biases prism of their personal interests, in other words, according to their personal apperception scheme Apperception is thus a general term for all mental processes in which a presentation is brought into connection with an already existent and systematized mental conception, and thereby is classified, explained or, in a word, understood; e.g. a new scientific phenomenon is explained in the light of phenomena already analysed and classified. The whole intelligent life of man is, consciously or unconsciously, a process of apperception, in as much as every act of attention involves the appercipient process. =Example= A rich child and a poor child walking together come across the same ten dollar bill on the sidewalk. The rich child says it is not very much money and the poor child says it is a lot of money. The difference lies in how they apperceive the same event – the lens of past experience through which they see and value (or devalue) the money.Ott, Christopher, The Evolution of Perception and the Cosmology of Substance, iUniverse, 2004.

This decapod, which is approximately long, is notable for the quantity of silky blond setae (resembling fur) covering its pereiopods (thoracic legs, including claws). Its discoverers dubbed it the \\"yeti lobster\\" or \\"yeti crab\\". Identification K. hirsuta was discovered in March 2005 by a group organized by Robert Vrijenhoek of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in Monterey, California and Michel Segonzac of the Ifremer and a Census of Marine Life scientist using the submarine DSV Alvin, operating from RV Atlantis. The discovery was announced on 7 March 2006. It was found along the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge, south of Easter Island at a depth of , living on hydrothermal vents. Based on both morphology and molecular data, the organism was deemed to form a new biological family (Kiwaidae); a second species, Kiwa puravida, was discovered in 2006 and described in 2011. Yeti Crabs live in the deep oceans, in hydrothermal vents, which are deep within the ocean. These vents provide hot water which makes up the environment of where these crabs live.The crabs regulate their ecosystem by using their hairy arms to collect toxins released from the hydrothermal vents. Characteristics The animal has strongly reduced eyes that lack pigment, and is thought to be blind. The \\"hairy\\" pincers contain filamentous bacteria, which the creature may use to detoxify poisonous minerals from the water emitted by the hydrothermal vents where it lives. This process is known as chemosynthesis. Lipid and isotope analyses provide evidence that epibiotic bacteria are the crab's main food source and K. puravida n. sp. has highly-modified setae (hairs) on its 3rd maxilliped (a mouth appendage) which it uses to harvest these bacteria. The ε- and γ- proteobacteria that this methane-seep species farms are closely related to hydrothermal-vent decapod epibionts. Alternatively, it may feed on bacteria, although it is generally thought to be a carnivore. Although it is often referred to as the \\"furry lobster\\" outside the scientific literature, Kiwa hirsuta is a squat lobster, more closely related to crabs and hermit crabs than true lobsters. The term \\"furry lobster\\" is more commonly used for the family Synaxidae.

It is also known as the jungle, Sind jungle, or rufous-backed sparrow. Very similar to the related house sparrow, it is smaller and has distinguishing plumage features. As in the house sparrow, the male has brighter plumage than female and young birds, including black markings and a grey crown. Distinctively, the male has a chestnut stripe running down its head behind the eye, and the female has a darker head than other sparrow species. Its main vocalisations are soft chirping calls that are extended into longer songs with other sounds interspersed by breeding males. Historically, this species was thought to be very closely related to the house sparrow, but its closest evolutionary affinities may lie elsewhere. The species was discovered around 1840, but went undetected for several decades afterwards. Within its Indus valley breeding range in Pakistan and western India, the Sind sparrow is patchily distributed in riverine and wetland habitats with thorny scrub and tall grass. During the non-breeding season, some birds enter drier habitats as they disperse short distances from their breeding habitat, or migrate into western Pakistan and the extreme east of Iran. Since this species is fairly common and expanding its range, it is assessed as least concern on the IUCN Red List. The Sind sparrow is social while feeding and gathers in small groups both while breeding and during winter dispersal. It feeds mostly on seeds and less often on insects, foraging close to the ground. Nests are made in the branches of thorny trees, and are untidy globular masses constructed from grass or other plant matter and lined with softer material. Both sexes are involved in building the nest and caring for the young, and usually raise two clutches of three to five young each breeding season.  Description  Illustration of a pair by John Gerrard Keulemans, 1888 The Sind sparrow is very similar to the house sparrow, and both sexes resemble their counterparts of that species, but it is slightly smaller and males and females each have features that distinguish them as Sind sparrows. The Sind sparrow is long, while the common South Asian subspecies of the house sparrow, Passer domesticus indicus, is long. Wingspans range from , tails from , and tarsi measure . The breeding male has a short and narrow black bib and a broad chestnut eye stripe that does not meet the mantle. The male has a grey crown and nape and a rufous lower back and rump. The female has a darker and greyer crown and cheek than the female house sparrow and the shoulder is darker chestnut. The female Dead Sea sparrow of the subspecies Passer moabiticus yattii is also similar to the female Sind sparrow, but has yellow tinges on the underparts and sometimes on parts of the head. The bill is black on the breeding male and pale brown on the non-breeding male and female. With a culmen length of , the Sind sparrow is slightly smaller-billed than the house sparrow. The Sind sparrow's chirping chup call is softer, less strident, and higher pitched than that of the house sparrow, and is easily distinguished. The song of breeding males includes chirrups interspersed with grating t-r-r-rt notes and short warbles or whistles.  Taxonomy  The Sind sparrow was first formally described by Edward Blyth, from a specimen collected by Alexander Burnes at Bahawalpur in around 1840. Blyth's description was published in an issue of the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal which, although dated 1844, was published only in 1845. The sparrow was not recorded until 36 years later, despite the efforts of noted ornithologists Allan Octavian Hume in Sindh and William Thomas Blanford in eastern Iran. This was probably because of its general similarity to the house sparrow, though additionally, Blyth's description of the species incorrectly described its rump feathers as maroon, and a description by Thomas C. Jerdon contained similar errors. Commenting on his unsuccessful search, Hume wrote that the hundreds of house sparrows he killed in pursuit of the Sind sparrow \\"ought to form a heavy load\\" on Blyth's conscience, and that if the Sind sparrow existed \\"it would be only decent for it ... to put on an appearance with as little delay as possible\\". Hume doubted its distinction, as did other ornithologists. The Sind sparrow was rediscovered by Scrope Berdmore Doig in 1880, in the Eastern Nara district. Ernst Hartert considered it a subspecies of the house sparrow, Passer domesticus pyrrhonotus, in his Die Vögel der paläarktishen Fauna, but Doig and Claud Ticehurst both found that the two species bred in the same areas without interbreeding. The specific epithet of the Sind sparrow, pyrrhonotus, comes from the Greek purrhos (\\"flame-coloured\\"), and -nōtos (\\"-backed\\"). E. C. Stuart Baker suggested the English name rufous-backed sparrow, but as this name might cause confusion with other species, Ticehurst suggested the name Sind jungle-sparrow, which became the accepted name for the species. This name refers to Sindh, a province now in Pakistan which makes up a large part of the Sind sparrow's range, and the jungle habitat of the bird (in the word's original sense of tangled dry thicket). This name is shortened to jungle sparrow or Sind sparrow, of which the first was used in the IOC World Bird List, until Sind sparrow was adopted in 2009. The Sind sparrow is a member of the genus Passer, which contains the house sparrow and around twenty other species. In a 1936 review of the house sparrow's relatives, German ornithologist Wilhelm Meise suggested that the Sind sparrow evolved from an isolated population of house sparrows, noting that the Indus valley is a centre of small bird types. British ornithologist J. Denis Summers-Smith considered the Sind sparrow to be part of the \\"Palaearctic black-bibbed sparrow\\" group including the house sparrow, though not one with a particularly close relationship with the house sparrow. Summer-Smith suggested that these species separated 25,000 to 15,000 years ago, during the last glacial period, when sparrows would have been isolated in ice-free refugia, such as the Indus River Delta, where he thought the Sind sparrow evolved. However, studies of mitochondrial DNA indicate an earlier origin of Passer species, with speciation occurring as early as the late Miocene and early Pliocene, about 5 million years ago. Hume and Ticehurst observed a resemblance, and a possible relation, between the Sind sparrow and the Dead Sea sparrow of the Middle East and Balochistan. William Robert Ogilvie-Grant and Henry Ogg Forbes saw a resemblance to the Abd al-Kuri sparrow, endemic to the island of Abd al-Kuri, in their 1899 description of that species, noted upon by Guy M. Kirwan in a 2008 study.  Distribution and habitat  Nest at Sultanpur National Park in India The Sind sparrow has a restricted distribution, primarily occurring within the Indus valley of Pakistan, and the lower parts of the tributaries of the Indus in the Punjab region. Its distribution extends from the Indus Delta north to the Kabul River near Nowshera and the Jhelum near Nurpur Noon, extending east into India as far as the Delhi area. It also breeds locally in parts of Pakistan's western province of Balochistan, and has been recorded several times in south-eastern Iran. The Sind sparrow is somewhat common in its restricted breeding range, and no threats are known to the survival of the species, so it is assessed as least concern on the IUCN Red List. During winter, it often makes short-distance movements, and some birds move into parts of western Pakistan and an adjoining corner of Iran, and less commonly north-western Gujarat, India. Longer movements may occur, as suggested by a possible sighting in the United Arab Emirates in November 2000. It mostly breeds in acacia and tamarisk scrub and tall grass, invariably near rivers or other wetlands. The construction and expansion of irrigation canals has increased its habitat in Sindh, and helped it extend its range into the Yamuna floodplain and parts of Rajasthan, India. It may breed around rice paddies and other fields, or human habitations, provided that there is enough cover and suitable nesting sites. In winter, it moves away from its main riverine habitat, and into drier thickets characterised by Salvadora and Capparis bushes, but never moves too far from water.  Behaviour  The Sind sparrow is gregarious, generally forming small groups of four to six birds while feeding. It tends to breed in loose colonies of a few pairs, and non-breeding birds may gather to roost in acacias or tamarisks near water. During winter, the non-breeding season, it forms larger flocks of as many as 30 birds, and joins flocks with other seed-eating birds, such as house sparrows and red avadavats. The Sind sparrow feeds mainly on the seeds of grasses and other plants such as Polygonum plebeium. It may also forage for insects such as caterpillars, especially to feed nestlings. Flocks forage on flats alongside rivers, flying into nearby bushes and continuing to forage when disturbed. Nesting occurs during a period of several months between April to September, the timing depending on rainfall, during which two clutches are raised by most pairs. Sind sparrows build nests in the upper branches of thorny trees or the ends of thin branches hanging over water. The nest is an untidy dome of grass and other plant matter, such as tamarisk twigs, roots, and reeds, with a diameter of about . The nest has an entrance located higher up on the sides, is somewhat flat on top, and is lined with softer plant material and feathers. The birds may sometimes build below the nests of egrets or extend the nest of a baya weaver or pied myna. Both the male and female take part in nest building and incubation. Clutches typically contain three to five eggs. Scrope Doig described the eggs as being markedly smaller than the house sparrow's, measuring 0.7 × 0.5 in (1.3 × 1.8 cm) and similarly greenish or greyish with highly variable blotches, striations, and other markings.

Early life and first marriage  Marie Thomase Amélie Delauney was born January 6, 1798 to Marie Bourdais, who was sixteen years old. Her father, Joseph-Charles Delaunay was an actor who happened upon a traveling acting company where he met Marie Boudais, the daughter of the troupe manager. He abandoned his daughter and died of yellow fever on July, 15, 1802. Dorval's mother died February 18, 1818. Dorval met Alain Dorval when she was fifteen years old, and he was thirty-six. The two were married in Vannes on February 12, 1814. Marie and her mother travelled parts of Brittany and France during the period from 1806-1810. By 1813, they joined the itinerant acting troupes run by Johann Ross in Paris, where the young Marie met Alain Dorval and married him in 1814. They had two children together, Marie-Louise-Désirée in 1814 and Catherine-Françoise-Sophie- Gabrielle in 1815. Dorval eventually left Marie and the children, and died a few years later in St. Petersburg.  Stage career  Marie Dorval in Agnès de Méranie by Hippolyte Lazerges (1817-1887) Marie began acting on stage in earnest following her husband Dorval's death. Eventually she played in staged melodramas, signing contracts with particular theater houses, which was when she started to see some success. On May 12, 1818, she began her Parisian acting career by playing the role of Pamela in Pamela Married, by the melodramatist Pelletier-Volméranges at the prestigious Porte Saint-Martin Theater. This was probably because of her relationship with Alexandre Piccini (grandson of Nicolas Piccini), who may have interceded on her behalf to get the role. The reviews were not pleasant after this role, but Dorval was able to in November 1818 gain access to the Paris’ Conservatoire, the teaching organ of the Comédie-Française, again by Piccini's intersession and monthly pension for her. She also benefited from her mother's name, Bordais, as members of her family had both studied and taught there. She studied with the celebrated tragedian, Pierre Lafon. She did not see great success until the age of 29, when she starred in the French play Trente ans, ou la vie d'un joueur (\\"Thirty years, or the life of a player.\\"). She had many successes that did follow, especially in popular productions at the Odéon Theatre. Her last two major appearances were in François Ponsard's Lucrèce (1843) and in Adolphe d'Ennery's Marie-Jeanne, ou la femme du peuple (Marie-Jeanne, Or the Woman of the People, 1845). Her career began going downhill with a shift in fashion and the public's desire for younger actresses, and she began traveling with a troupe of actors doing small shows around the countryside. By the age of 51, her health was failing due to her long life of travel and shows, and she sank into depression following the death of one of her grandchildren. Sand assumed the financial support for Dorval's surviving grandchildren following Marie's death in 1849.  Relationship with George Sand  In January, 1833, female writer George Sand met Marie Dorval after the former wrote the actress a letter of appreciation following one of her performances. The two women became involved in an intimate friendship, and were rumored to have become lovers. This has been debated, and never has been verified. Sand wrote about Dorval, including many passages where she is described as smitten with Dorval. > Only those who know how differently we were made can realize how utterly I > was in thrall to her...God had given her the power to express what she > felt...She was beautiful, and she was simple. She had never been taught > anything, but there was nothing she did not know by instinct. I can find no > words with which to describe how cold and incomplete my own nature is. I can > express nothing. There must be a sort of paralysis in my brain which > prevents what I feel from ever finding a form through which it can achieve > communication...When she appeared upon the stage, with her drooping figure, > her listless gait, her sad and penetrating glance...I can say only that it > was as though I were looking at an embodied spirit. Because of the way that Sand wrote about Dorval in her letters to Dorval and her own journals, Dorval may have been the love of Sand's life, regardless of the sexual nature of it. Theater critic Gustave Planche reportedly warned Sand to stay away from Dorval. Likewise, Count Alfred de Vigny, Dorval's lover from 1831 to 1838, warned the actress to stay away from Sand, whom he referred to as \\"that damned lesbian\\". Victor Hugo wrote in his own journals that de Vigny was supremely jealous of Hugo's own relationship with Dorval, which could cast doubt on the rumors surrounding Sand and Dorval. Popular writers from that time, such as Théophile Gautier and Honoré de Balzac, capitalized on the rumors. Whatever the truth in their relationship, Sand and Dorval remained close friends for the remainder of Dorval's lifetime. In 1834, Dorval starred in Vigny's play Chatterton, and in 1840 she played the lead in a play written by Sand, titled Cosima, and the two women collaborated on the script. However, the play was not well-received, and was cancelled after only seven showings.

This technique is primarily used for objects such as trees, grass, or buildings which can be represented as repeated geometry without appearing unduly repetitive, but may also be used for characters. Although vertex data is duplicated across all instanced meshes, each instance may have other differentiating parameters (such as color, or skeletal animation pose) changed in order to reduce the appearance of repetition.  API support  Starting in Direct3D version 9, Microsoft included support for geometry instancing. This method improves the potential runtime performance of rendering instanced geometry by explicitly allowing multiple copies of a mesh to be rendered sequentially by specifying the differentiating parameters for each in a separate stream. The same functionality is available in the OpenGL core in versions 3.1 and up, and may be accessed in some earlier implementations using the EXT_draw_instanced extension.  In offline rendering  Geometry instancing in Houdini, Maya or other 3D packages usually involves mapping a static or pre-animated object or geometry to particles or arbitrary points in space, which can then be rendered by almost any offline renderer. Geometry instancing in offline rendering is useful for creating things like swarms of insects, in which each one can be detailed, but still behaves in a realistic way that does not have to be determined by the animator. Most packages allow variation of the material or material parameters on a per instance basis, which helps ensure that instances do not appear to be exact copies of each other. In Houdini, many object level attributes (e.g. such as scale) can also be varied on a per instance basis. Because instancing geometry in most 3D packages only references the original object, file sizes are kept very small and changing the original changes all of the instances. In many offline renderers, such as Pixar's PhotoRealistic RenderMan, instancing is achieved by using delayed load render procedurals to only load geometry when the bucket containing the instance is actually being rendered. This means that the geometry for all the instances does not have to be in memory at once.

At and , it is among the larger sparrows. Both sexes have plumage ranging from dull grey to sandy brown, and pale brown legs. Females have less boldly coloured plumage and bills, lacking the pattern of black stripes on the male's head. The head markings of both sexes make the saxaul sparrow distinctive, and unlikely to be confused with any other bird. Vocalisations include a comparatively soft and musical chirping call, a song, and a flight call. Three subspecies are recognised, differing in the overall tone of their plumage and in the head striping of the female. The subspecies ammodendri occurs in the west of the saxaul sparrow's range, while stoliczkae and nigricans occur in the east. This distribution falls into six probably disjunct areas across Central Asia, from central Turkmenistan to northern Gansu in China. A bird of deserts, the saxaul sparrow favours areas with shrubs such as the saxaul, near rivers and oases. Though it has lost parts of its range to habitat destruction caused by agriculture, it is not seriously threatened by human activities. Little is known of the saxaul sparrow's behaviour. Often hidden in foliage, it forages in trees and on the ground. It feeds mostly on seeds, as well as insects while breeding and as a nestling. When not breeding it forms wandering flocks, but it is less social than other sparrows while breeding, often nesting in isolated pairs. Nests are round bundles of dry plant material lined with soft materials such as feathers. They are built in holes in tree cavities, earth banks, rocky slopes, and within man-made structures or the nests of birds of prey. Two clutches of five or six eggs are typically laid in a season. Both parents construct the nest and care for their eggs and young.  Description  An illustration of a pair by Henry Eeles Dresser The saxaul sparrow is one of the larger sparrows at and . Wing length varies from , with males generally being larger. The tail is short at . The saxaul sparrow's legs are pale or pinkish brown, with a tarsus length of . Its bill is long, pale grey on the juvenile, pale yellowish with a black tip on the breeding female, and black on the breeding male. Like all other sparrows, it flies swiftly and often at height. Distinctive markings, especially on its head, make the saxaul sparrow unlikely to be confused with any other bird. It is dull-coloured, with plumage ranging between dull grey and warm sandy brown, varying between and within subspecies. Birds of the subspecies ammodendri are a sandy grey, while nigricans birds are similar but darker, and stoliczkae birds are warm brown or russet. Birds of the subspecies stoliczkae and those from the southwest of the range of ammodendri also differ from usual ammodendri birds in their lack of streaking on the rump and upper tail coverts. Birds in Mongolia have a larger and deeper bill and broad bluish streaks on their chest. The male saxaul sparrow has bold markings, with a black stripe along the top of its head and another through its eye. It has black feathering, or a \\"bib\\", on its throat and upper belly. By comparison to other sparrows this is thin on the throat, but wide on the breast. The male has a bright russet patch on the sides of its crown and nape. Its cheeks are pale grey or buff, and its underparts are whitish, tinged buff or grey on its sides. Its back is grey or warm brown, streaked variably with black. Its shoulders are more lightly streaked with black bars. The male's thin tail is brown, with the edges and tips of feathers paler. Its median coverts are black with a white tip, while its other wing feathers are variably dark brown, cinnamon, or black, tipped buff or whitish and edged grey. The non-breeding male differs in having slightly paler plumage. The female is similar in some ways to the male, but paler and duller. It is sandy grey or brown, with a back patterned like that of the male, and white or whitish underparts. The head of the females of the subspecies ammodendri and nigricans is dingy grey with darker smudges on the forehead, behind its eyes, and on its throat. The female of the subspecies stoliczkae is buff-brown with a white throat, a conspicuous pale supercilium, darker forehead, and lighter cheeks. The juvenile is similar to the female, differing in its lack of dark tinges on its throat and crown. In adults, moulting begins in July and ends in late August or early September. The post-juvenile moult is complete, and occurs variously from June to August. The saxaul sparrow's vocalisations are little reported. Its common call is a chirp, transcribed as cheerp cheerp, softer and more melodious than that of the house sparrow. It gives a flight call transcribed as twerp, and a song described by Russian naturalist V. N. Shnitnikov as \\"not loud, but pleasantly melodious with fairly diversified intonations\\".  Taxonomy  Male in Mongolia The saxaul sparrow was first described by English zoologist John Gould in a March 1872 instalment of The Birds of Asia, from a specimen collected near Kyzylorda, now in southern Kazakhstan, by Russian naturalist Nikolai Severtzov. Severtzov had been planning to describe the species as Passer ammodendri for several years and had been distributing specimens among other naturalists. When natural history dealer Charles Dode escaped from the Paris Commune in 1871 with some of his collection, Gould obtained specimens from a set of rare birds Dode exhibited to the Zoological Society of London. Severtzov did not describe the species until 1873, and some later writers preferred to attribute him, but Gould's description takes priority over Severtzov's. The saxaul sparrow's species name refers to its desert habitat, coming from the name of the Ammodendron or sand acacia tree, which is in turn derived from the Ancient Greek άμμος (ammos, \\"sand\\") and δένδρον (dendron, \\"tree\\"). The English name saxaul sparrow refers to the saxaul plant, with which it is closely associated. The saxaul sparrow usually is classified in the genus Passer with the house sparrow and around twenty other species, although a genus Ammopasser was created for the saxaul sparrow by Nikolai Zarudny in 1890. The saxaul sparrow's relations within the genus Passer are unclear, although with its black throat feathering it has usually been considered part of the \\"Palaearctic black-bibbed sparrow\\" group related to the house sparrow. J. Denis Summers-Smith considered that the Palaearctic Passer sparrows evolved about 25,000 to 15,000 years ago, during the last glacial period. During this time, sparrows would have been isolated in ice-free refugia, such as a certain steppe region in Central Asia, where Summers-Smith suggested the saxaul sparrow evolved. Genetic and fossil evidence suggest a much earlier origin for the Passer species, perhaps in the Miocene and Pliocene, as suggested by Luis Allende and colleagues in their 2001 phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA. This analysis also suggested that the saxaul sparrow may be an early offshoot or basal species in its genus, a relative of certain African sparrows such as the northern grey-headed sparrow. If the saxaul sparrow is related to these species, either the saxaul sparrow formerly occurred in the deserts of Africa and Arabia, or each of the groups of Passer sparrows are of African origin. Diagrams of the plumage of breeding males of the subspecies ammodendri (left) and stoliczkae (right) Across its Central Asian distribution, the saxaul sparrow occurs in six probably disjunct areas, and is divided into at least three subspecies. The nominate subspecies Passer ammodendri ammodendri inhabits three of these areas, one in the Syr Darya basin of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, and another to the south of Lake Balkhash and the north of Almaty, where it is only common in the valley of the Ili River. In a third area, sometimes recognised as a subspecies korejewi, ammodendri birds breed sporadically in parts of central Turkmenistan, Iran, and possibly Afghanistan, migrating to the south during the winter. The subspecies stoliczkae was named after Ferdinand Stoliczka in 1874 by Allan Octavian Hume, from specimens Stoliczka collected in Yarkand. This subspecies is separated from the other two subspecies by the Tian Shan mountains. It is found across a broad swath of China from Kashgar east to the far west of Inner Mongolia, through the areas around the Taklamakan Desert (but probably not in the inhospitable desert itself), and through the east of Xinjiang, northern Gansu, and the fringes of southern Mongolia. In the extreme west of the Gobi Desert a disjunct population separated from the other stoliczkae birds by the Gurvan Saikhan Uul mountains occurs, which is sometimes separated as a subspecies timidus. The subspecies nigricans, described by ornithologist L. S. Stepanyan in 1961, is found in northern Xinjiang's Manasi River valley.  Habitat  The saxaul sparrow is found in remote parts of Central Asia, where its distribution is believed to fall into six disjunct areas, although this is uncertain due to the scarcity of records. It is found in deserts, especially around rivers and oases. It is usually found around shrubs such as saxaul (Haloxylon), poplar (Populus), or tamarisk (Tamarix). Sometimes it occurs around settlements and grain fields, especially during the winter. It is not believed to be threatened, since it is reported as locally common across a wide range, and hence it is assessed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. However, it seems to have lost large parts of its range to the intensification of agriculture and desertification caused by overgrazing.  Behaviour  Transcaspia Little is known of the saxaul sparrow's behaviour, because of its remote range. It is shy in many areas, and spends much time hidden in foliage, but breeding birds in Mongolia were reported to be \\"quite confiding\\". When not breeding, it is social, and can form flocks of up to fifty birds, sometimes associating with Eurasian tree, Spanish, and house sparrows. In some regions, it makes small local migrations. Towards the spring, saxaul sparrows form pairs within their flock, before dispersing in April. Seeds, especially those of the saxaul, are most of its diet, though it also eats insects, especially while breeding, most commonly weevils, grasshoppers, and caterpillars. It forages in trees and on the ground. In a study of insects fed to nestlings in the Ili River valley, it was found that beetles are predominant, with weevils and Coccinellidae comprising 60 and 30 percent of the diet of nestlings, respectively. Because of its desert habitat and scarcity, it is not a pest of agriculture. Where water is not available, the saxaul sparrow may fly several times each day over long distances to drink. The saxaul sparrow is less social than other sparrows while breeding, due to its dry habitat and its choices of nesting locations, holes in trees and earth banks. Isolated pairs are usual, though it sometimes breeds in small groups, with members of its own species as well as house and Eurasian tree sparrows. The breeding season is short, lasting from May to July, with most young raised in April and June. Unusually for a sparrow, it has not been recorded nesting openly in branches, though this may simply represent the lack of published records. Nests are often built in tree cavities, where they are sometimes placed close together. Other common nesting localities are earth banks and rocky slopes, and nests have been recorded on the nests of birds of prey, unused buildings, walls, and electricity pylons. Nests in man-made structures are increasingly common, as large trees in the saxaul sparrow's habitat are removed. Nests may be quite close to the ground, especially when they are built in trees. The saxaul sparrow's nests are untidy dome-shaped constructions, with an entrance in the side or top. They are built of grasses, roots, and other plant materials, and are lined with feathers, fur, and soft plant material. The nest is mainly built by the female, though the male may actively take part in building. Typical clutches have five or six eggs, and two clutches a year are normal. Eggs are broad and ovular, slightly pointed at an end. They are glossy, coloured white and shaded with rusty grey or yellowish brown. In some clutches, one egg is noticeably paler than the others. Four eggs collected by Zarudny from Transcaspia had an average size of . Females play the main part in incubating eggs, and males can often be seen guarding the nests during incubation. Males and females share in feeding their young, which they do every 4 to 12 minutes. Young that have left their nest remain nearby until well after their moult, before departing for winter flocks, followed later by the adults.

Early years Starke grew up in New Rochelle, New York and attended public schools there. His father, George Starke, Sr., was a high school principal in Yonkers, New York and his mother, Shirley Starke, was a registered nurse. He has Mohawk ancestry on his mother's side. Upon graduation from New Rochelle High School, Starke received a series of football awards, including All- Westchester County, All-Metropolitan, All-State and All-American. He was inducted into the New Rochelle and Westchester County Halls of Fame. College career Starke decided to attend Columbia College after having traveled much of the United States on a college tour that was sponsored by the many institutions offering him admission and full scholarships. The last college he visited prior to accepting Columbia College was Notre Dame. Had he gone there, he would have teamed with Notre Dame's quarterback Joe Theisman who later teamed with Starke in the Super Bowl victory over the Miami Dolphins. One last attempt to sidetrack Starke's Columbia decision was made by the University of Virginia, which offered him the opportunity to not only attend their school on full scholarship, but also be the person to desegregate their college. Starke declined this offer. While at Columbia College in New York City, Starke led his college football team in receptions as a tight end in 1969. At Columbia, Starke majored in physics and, in addition to football, also played center on a Columbia basketball team that featured All-Americans Jim McMillan and Haywood Dotsun. That Columbia basketball team would rise in the collegiate national basketball rankings to number 2 in the United States, just below UCLA. In 1983, Starke received Columbia's highest graduate award, the \\"John Jay Award\\" for prestigious graduate achievement. Pro football In spite of being drafted by the Redskins, Starke's pro football career had a rough start. Two weeks into Redskins training camp in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, Starke was cut by the Redskins and went to Kansas City, Missouri to try out for the Kansas City Chiefs. After spending the remainder of the training camp with the Chiefs and being told he would make the squad, Starke was the last player cut by head coach Hank Stram just before the season began. In July 1972, Starke journeyed to Thousand Oaks, California to try out for the Dallas Cowboys. The Cowboys trained in the hills 40 miles north of Los Angeles to escape the heat of suburban Dallas, Texas. After six weeks of training camp with the Cowboys, Starke was cut but he was asked by the Redskins to return and try again. One year later and one year wiser, Starke made the Redskins roster. Placed originally on the taxi squad, Starke eventually moved up to the regular roster and by mid 1973 the starting position as right tackle. Initially, Starke played on coach George Allen's \\"Over the Hill Gang\\" and by 1979 under coach Jack Pardee, he was named offensive captain of the team. In 1981 under new coach Joe Gibbs, a young group of offensive linemen developed. This group, which became known as \\"The Hogs\\" later went on to become the most famous offensive group of linemen to ever play in the National Football League. Regardless of the fact that he was ten years older than the rest, Starke became their leader and as such he became known as the \\"Head Hog\\". Starke's first Super Bowl was with the \\"Over the Hill Gang\\" in 1972. Later with the \\"Hogs\\", Starke returned for Super Bowl XVII and Super Bowl XVIII after the 1982 NFL season and 1983 NFL season winning the first against the Miami Dolphins and losing the second against the Oakland Raiders. Starke's last full football season was 1984. He retired during training camp in 1985. Life with the Hogs Prior to retiring during the years 1983 and 1984, Starke capitalized on the notoriety of the \\"Hogs\\" by bringing them together getting each of them to invest $500.00 and forming a corporation called \\"Super Hogs\\". \\"Super Hogs\\" became the first professional athletes of any sport to market themselves outside of the National Football League oversight. \\"Super Hogs\\" created a clothing line, beer company, sold various \\"Hogs\\" themes merchandise and produced the two most successful football posters of all times: (1) Hogs Night Out and (2) The Grave Yard Dogs. Life after the Skins After retiring from the Washington Redskins in September 1985, Starke began working simultaneously on two careers. He was accepted into Ford Motor Companies Dealer Operations Training School in Baltimore, Maryland. Two years later, he graduated and along with a partner opened \\"George Starke Ford\\" in Emmitsburg, Maryland. At the same time, Starke began his career in television broadcasting building on his many T.V. appearances in conjunction with local sports personalities who interviewed him as captain of the Washington Redskins. These interview shows included regular appearances with Glen Brenner - Local Channel 9, Bernie Smilovitz - Local Fox Channel 5 and others. After his retirement from pro football, Starke hosted PM Magazine and co-hosted the show \\"Redskins Saturday Night\\" with Pete Wysocki. In addition, Starke began working as a host for Hometeam Sports (Comcast) and a color commentator for ESPN College Football and CBS National Football League Broadcasts co-hosted with James Brown. The \\"Redskins Saturday Night\\" shows went on to win several local Emmies. In 1989, Starke founded a beer company called \\"Head Hog Premium Beer\\" that sold beer within the historic Redskins broadcast footprint, which extended from Delaware in the north to Georgia in the south. That company evolved into \\"Head Hog BBQ Restaurants\\" in Bethesda, Maryland and Rockville, Maryland. In 1996 being alarmed by the spike in youth violence in the District of Columbia and determining that violence was primarily a job issue, that involved a large number of youth who were illiterate and therefore unemployable, rather than a crime issue, Starke founded a not-for profit job training facility he named the Excel Institute. The Institute was designed as a two-year adult education program for at risk youth above the age of 16 that provides basic education, life skills counseling and autotech vocational training. Two basic tenets of the Institute were that (1) anyone above the age of sixteen who wanted to attend was admitted and (2) all students were on full scholarship - i.e., nobody had to pay. In October 2010, after graduating over 500 students, Starke retired from management and the Board of the Excel Institute. After retirement from the Institute, Starke founded Starke Communications, a communications firm that provides communications, PR and marketing services to corporate clients. Starke Communications also provides motivational speakers for its clients. Personal George Starke lives with his wife \\"Petra Smeltzer Starke\\" in Beverly Hills, California. Petra Starke, who grew up in Prague as Czech national, graduated from Georgetown University Law Center cum laude and used to practice law in Washington, D.C., including in the Obama White House. She is currently the founder and Chief Idealist of SweatNGlow, a chain of the largest and fastest-growing hot yoga studio network worldwide.

Of particular comparison to previous albums was the failure of any particular song to stand out in quality. Decibel Magazine provided a mixed review, complimenting Victor's \\"big riffs\\" but otherwise feeling it under-performed with an ugly cover and under-cooked production. In contrast to COC's review, Decibel specifically noted that each song did use unique mixes of riffs, but that the differences were subtle to the level of requiring specific attention to note differences. All Music also gave a mixed review, complimenting \\"The gritty guitars, the stop/start rhythms, the anger and the vicious ill will\\", but again noting the lack of any standout tunes and the absence of any general difference from their earlier music.

The release coincided with Sinatra's 80th birthday celebration. The original 1995 packaging had the 20 discs encased in a small, leather-bound trunk. When it was re-released in 1998, it was repackaged in a more-standard (and cheaper) cardboard format. Features As the title implies, the set claims to contain every song ever recorded in the studio during Sinatra's career with Reprise Records, but misses the 49-second \\"I'm Getting Sentimental Over You (Reprise)\\" included as the closing track from the 1961 album I Remember Tommy and also leaves off a remake of \\"Body and Soul\\" and \\"Leave It All To Me\\" (a song written by Paul Anka), in addition to several alternate versions of songs included in the set. The set is the largest ever released for Sinatra to-date, containing 452 tracks on twenty compact discs.

Its subsidiaries include Southern California Edison, and unregulated non-utility business assets Edison Energy. Edison's roots trace back to Holt & Knupps, a company founded in 1886 as a provider of street lights in Visalia, California. History The company was first incorporated in 1909 as Southern California Edison Company after Southern California acquired the assets of Edison Electric Company; it was known as Southern California Edison until 1996 when it adopted its current name in recognition of its growing business abroad and in other industry sectors. Edison first became a holding company in 1988 when it made a small change to its original name, becoming known as SCEcorp. Edison International became the naming rights holder for the Anaheim Angels' stadium (which was previously known as Anaheim Stadium) in 1998 in a deal running for 20 years. The company backed out of the naming rights deal after the 2003 season, and the stadium is now called Angel Stadium. In 2001 Edison's main holding, Southern California Edison faced bankruptcy after a state senate bill regarding financial assistance came up short (by $1 billion). On August 6, 2002, Edison International recorded core earnings per share of 56 cents in the second quarter of 2002. Recent moves In November 2010 Edison sold its 48% interest in the Four Corners coal-fired power plant in New Mexico (units 4 and 5 while units 1,2 and 3 will be closed because of being older) for $294 million to Pinnacle West Capital Corp (of Arizona Public Service). The move was the direct result of a new California law requiring utility companies to exit coal-fired power production (even the renewing of contracts is disallowed), and forces Edison to purchase more power from the market. San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station Unit 2 shut in early January 2012 for refueling and replacement of the reactor vessel head. Both reactors at San Onofre have been shut since January 2012 due to premature wear found on tubes in massive steam generators installed in 2010 and 2011. In April 2012, in a sign of mounting concern over the shutdown, the top U.S. nuclear official, Gregory Jaczko, toured the facility with Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, and U.S. Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican. In June, 2013, the company announced it would permanently shut down operations at the plant, the beginning of a multi-year decommissioning process at the site. Energy production mix At least 46% of the fuel Southern California Edison uses to generate power comes from clean energy (6% of that nuclear power, the others renewable energy sources ranging from biomass to wind).SCE-Renewable Energy The group is a major player in Southern California where it provides 13 million people with electricity. Southern California Edison began to focus on renewable energy in 1980.

Sir Edward Fry (4 November 1827 – 19 October 1918) was a judge in the English Court of Appeal (1883–1892) and also an arbitrator on the Permanent Court of Arbitration. He was a Quaker, son of Joseph Fry (1795–1879) and Mary Ann Swaine. Domestic legal and judicial career He was called to the bar in 1854, took silk in 1869 and became a judge in Chancery in 1877. He was raised to the Court of Appeal in 1883 and retired in 1892. Retirement from the court did not mean retirement from legal work. He sat on some cases in the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. In 1897 he accepted an offer to preside over the royal commission on the Irish Land Acts. He also acted as an arbitrator in the Welsh coal strike (1898), the Grimsby fishery dispute (1901) and between the London and North Western Railway Company and its employees (1906, 1907). =Judgments= Judgments of Fry include: *Foakes v Beer [1884] UKHL 1, [1881-85] All ER Rep 106, (1884) 9 App Cas 605; 54 LJQB 130; 51 LT 833; 33 WR 233 - (Fry sitting in the Court of Appeal) - a leading case from the House of Lords on the legal concept of consideration. *Smith v Land and House Property Corp (1884) LR 28 Ch D 7 - English contract law case, concerning misrepresentation and holding that a statement of opinion can represent that one knows certain facts, and can amount to misrepresentation. *Isle of Wight Rly Co v Tahourdin (1884) LR 25 Ch D 320 - a UK company law case on removing directors under the Companies Clauses Act 1845; Fry concurring with Cotton LJ and Lindley LJ *Edgington v Fitzmaurice (1885) 29 Ch D 459 - contract law case, concerning misrepresentation *Falcke v Scottish Imperial Insurance Co (1886) 34 Ch 234 - an English unjust enrichment law case, also concerning English contract law, and setting out some fundamental principles of construction of obligations, as viewed to exist by the late 19th-century English judiciary; Fry concurring with Bowen LJ. *In the Arbitration between Secretary of State for Home Department and Fletcher (1887) - upholding a Queens bench decision supporting the authority of the Inspector of Mines to require the use of safety lamps; Bowen LJ dissenting. *Mogul Steamship Co Ltd v McGregor, Gow & Co [1892] AC 25, (1889) 23 QBD 598, (1888) LR 21 QBD 544 - (Fry sitting in the Court of Appeal) - an English tort law case concerning the economic tort of conspiracy to injure. A product of its time, the courts adhered to a laissez faire doctrine allowing firms to form a cartel. *British South Africa Co v Companhia de Moçambique [1893] AC 602 (Fry sitting in the Court of Appeal) - the House of Lords overturned Fry's Court of Appeal decision and by so doing established the Mozambique rule, a common law rule in private international law that renders actions relating to title in foreign land, the right to possession of foreign land, and trespass to foreign land non-justiciable in common law jurisdictions. International legal and arbitration career He was also involved in international law. In 1902 he acted as one of five arbitrators at The Hague in the Pious Fund of the Californias dispute between the United States and Mexico, the first dispute between states arbitrated by the Permanent Court of Arbitration. In 1904 he was the British legal assessor on the commission to investigate the Dogger Bank incident where the Russian navy accidentally attacked a British herring fleet in the North Sea. He was involved in the second Hague Conference (1907). In 1908/1909 he was an arbitrator between France and Germany over a case where France had seized deserters (including some German citizens) from German diplomatic protection. Zoological and botanical work Besides law he was on the council of University College London and interested in Zoology (he was elected to the Royal Society in 1883). He wrote two books on bryophytes, British Mosses (1892) and, with his daughter Agnes, The Liverworts: British and Foreign (1911).  Suppression of opium  In his preface to the 1884 report to the Houses of Parliament titled The Indo-Chinese opium trade considered in relation to its history, morality, and expediency, and its influence on Christian missions, Fry wrote: > \\"We English, by the policy we have pursued, are morally responsible for > every acre of land in China which is withdrawn from the cultivation of grain > and devoted to that of the poppy; so that the fact of the growth of the drug > [opium] in China ought only to increase our sense of responsibility\\". Family Edward Fry married in 1859 Mariabella Hodgkin (1833–1930), daughter of John Hodgkin, granddaughter of Luke Howard, and sister of the historian, Thomas Hodgkin: and they were the parents of seven daughters, one dying young, and two sons. The children included: *Joan Mary Fry (1862–1955) Quaker social reformer *Roger Fry (1866–1934) – Artist, member of the Bloomsbury Group *Agnes Fry (1868–1957) – co-writer with her father on several scientific treatises and later wrote a biography of him; and her twin sister Isabel Fry, educator *(Sara) Margery Fry (1874–1958) – penal reformer, principal of Somerville College (1926–1931), founder of the Howard League *Anna Ruth Fry (1876–1962) – pacifist and Quaker activist.

Bissektipelta is a monospecific genus, containing only the type species B. archibaldi. History of discovery In September 1998, the joint Usbek-Russian-British-American- Project excavated the braincase of an ankylosaur. In 2002, Alexandr Averianov, based on this find, named a second species of the genus Amtosaurus: Amtosaurus archibaldi. The specific name honours James David Archibald, leading the URBAC (Uzbekistan, Russia, Britain, America, & Canada) project that performed the excavation. The holotype, ZIN PH 1/6, and only known specimen was collected from the Bissekty Formation, dating from the late Turonian-Coniacian, of Dzharakuduk. The holotype consists of a well-preserved, fully ossified braincase with a partial skull roof, along with isolated teeth and osteoderms. In 2004, Jolyon Parish and Paul Barrett concluded that the type species of Amtosaurus, Amtosaurus magnus, was a nomen dubium, a dubious name. This implied that no other species could be validly referred to the genus Amtosaurus. A. archibaldi should be reassigned to a new taxon. They renamed the genus as Bissektipelta with the generic name combining a reference to the geological formation with a Latin pelta (meaning small shield), which is derived from the Greek peltè (meaning shield). The type species is the original A. archibaldi but the new combination is Bissektipelta archibaldi. Two additional specimens were referred to by Kuzmin and colleagues in 2020. These consist of ZIN PH 281/16, a smaller but well-preserved partial braincase with open sutures between some bones and ZIN PH 2329/16, another braincase similar in size to the holotype that is slightly damaged and mixed up within the sediment layer. Description Parish & Barrett indicated some distinguishing traits of Bissektipelta. One of these is an autapomorphy, a unique derived character. On the top skull roof grooves are present, together forming a truncated \\"Y\\" and separating three polygonal areas of flat remodelled bone tissue. These grooves reflected the position of skull osteoderms. Averianov had in 2002 proposed three traits in which A. archibaldi differed from A. magnus. Its braincase has three exits for the Nervus hypoglossus (cranial nerve XII) instead of two. It also has a more limited angle of 90° between the ventral surfaces of the basioccipital and the basisphenoid, and more caudally, to the rear, situated basipterygoid processes. In 2004, these were no longer considered unique traits but the triple exits were seen as rare. Classification When described in 2002, Averianov placed A. archibaldi in the Ankylosauridae. Parish & Barrett thought such precision was unwarranted and placed the newly Bissektipelta in a more general Ankylosauria. However, Victoria M. Arbour and Philip J. Currie affirmed the position within the Ankylosauridae. Based on numerous cranial traits, Kuzmin and colleagues have placed Bissektipelta within the advanced Ankylosaurinae in a basal position and confirmed its valid taxonomic status. Paleobiology In 2019, Alifanov and Saveliev redescribed the braincase noting that Bissektipelta had a well-developed olfaction, poor hearing and eyesight, good taste sensitivity, omnivorous diet and the unusual ability for filter-feeding. Also, the brain structure of Bissektipelta is rather primitive compared with other ankylosaur species. In 2020, Ivan Kuzmin and colleagues described and examined the braincase specimens of Bissektipelta in extensive detail. They performed a 3D reconstruction of the endocast of the brain cavity using CT scans and they revealed that a considerable part of the brain of Bissektipelta was occupied by olfactory bulbs, confirming that Bissektipelta had an extremely developed sense of smell. The numerous small vascular canals around the skull roof, the lateral wall of the brain case and cranial vessels form a complex network around the brain which allowed the redistribution of the blood flow and physiological mechanisms for heat exchange in order to cool-down the brain and maintain optimal temperatures. In addition, the length of the cochlear ducts in the inner ear suggests that Bissektipelta, and many other ankylosaurs, were adapted for low frequency-hearing within 100 Hz and 3000 Hz. The elongated cochlear ducts in the more advanced ankylosaurines seem to indicate that these traits were adapted for enhanced hearing at lower frequencies.

Collegiate career Following high school, Gamble enrolled at Lincoln College in Illinois, where he played for two seasons under head coach Alan Pickering. After two seasons at Lincoln, Gamble transferred to the University of Iowa. He was part of a 1985 recruiting class which included B. J. Armstrong, Roy Marble, Les Jepsen and Ed Horton. All five recruits went on to play in the National Basketball Association. Horton and Gamble played together at Lanphier High School. Under coach George Raveling Gamble played off the bench in his first season at Iowa. After the season, Raveling left Iowa for the University of Southern California. On April 7, 1986, Iowa named Tom Davis as its new head coach. Davis’ arrival reversed Gamble's fortunes, as he became a starter for Iowa in his senior season, and the team began the season with 17 straight wins to earn the #1 ranking in the AP Poll. In the Sweet Sixteen of the 1987 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, Gamble hit the winning shot against the University of Oklahoma to send the Hawkeyes to the Elite Eight, where they faced the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Against UNLV, Gamble attempted a 3-pointer as time expired, but the shot bounced off the rim, ending what was arguably Tom Davis's most successful season at Iowa. Iowa finished with a 30–5 record. Professional career =Rookie season (1987–1988)= Gamble was selected with the 17th pick of the third round (63rd overall) by the Portland Trail Blazers in the 1987 NBA Draft. He only played in 19 minutes with Portland before being waived on December 9, 1987. Gamble then headed to the Continental Basketball Association for the Quad City Thunder, where he averaged 21.1 points per game (ppg) with the team in 1988. Gamble then played in the Philippine Basketball Association for the Añejo Rum 65 in the spring and Chicago Express of the World Basketball League in the summer of 1988. =Later career (1988–1996)= In the fall of 1988, Gamble returned to the Quad City Thunder and scored 27.8 points in a 12-game stint with the team. On December 15, the Boston Celtics signed Gamble after Larry Bird was injured. Initially a reserve, Gamble started the final six games, where he scored over 15 points and played over 30 minutes per game.https://www.basketball- reference.com/players/g/gamblke01/gamelog/1989 In his debut start with the Celtics, a 113–104 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers on April 14, 1989, Gamble had a double-double with 20 points and 10 assists, in addition to grabbing seven rebounds. Gamble played in one playoff game before going down with an injury; the Celtics were swept by the Detroit Pistons in the first round. Gamble played in 71 games the following season, 1989–1990, averaging 5.1 points in 13.9 minutes-per-game. After seeing spot duty for two seasons, Gamble assumed a major role with Boston in 1990–91. Gamble played in every game, including 76 starts, and averaged 15.6 points (fourth on the team, behind Bird, Reggie Lewis and Kevin McHale) in 33 minutes per game and helped the Celtics to a 56–26 record and a return to first place in the Atlantic Division. His 58.7% shooting percentage was third-best in the NBA. He also placed second to Scott Skiles of Orlando in the voting for the NBA Most Improved Player Award, the closest finish in the history of the award, with a winning margin of four votes. Gamble's minutes were cut dramatically in the playoffs and he averaged just six points per game against the Indiana Pacers and Detroit Pistons. Gamble played in all 82 games the next season, starting 77 of them, but the Celtics were eliminated by the Cleveland Cavaliers in the second round of the playoffs. He then saw his starting time drop dramatically in his final two seasons in Boston, playing in 75 games but starting only 29 in 1994. Following the season, Gamble signed a free agent contract with the Miami Heat, playing in 44 games (starting 13) before a late February 1996 trade sent him to the Sacramento Kings. With the Kings, Gamble did not start a game for the remainder of the season. He returned in 1996–97 to play in 62 games and start two, but averaged only five points a game. He did not play for the Kings in 1997–98 and was released by the team on February 20, 1998. For his NBA career, Gamble averaged 9.5 points with a 50.2% shooting percentage, with a 36% three point percentage and making 81% of free throws. He also averaged 2.2 rebounds and 2.0 assists in 22.4 minutes per game for 649 games. Coaching career In 2002, Gamble was named the first head men's basketball coach at the University of Illinois at Springfield (UIS), who began play in the American Midwest Conference of the NAIA that season. In his fourth year at the helm, 2005–06, Gamble coached the Prairie Stars to an AMC Tournament championship and a berth in the NAIA National Tournament. The next season, 2006–07, saw the Prairie Stars capture their first AMC regular season title outright, win their second consecutive AMC Tournament and advance to the second round of the NAIA National Tournament. Gamble's team went 11–1 in conference play and 23–9 overall as his continued success earned Gamble his second AMC Coach of the Year honor. Two years later, in 2008–09, the team posted a 21–9 record in their final season of NAIA play. Beginning in 2009–10, the Prairie Stars joined the NCAA's Division II and the Great Lakes Valley Conference. Gamble's team posted an 11–13 record in their first year of NCAA competition. In June 2010, Gamble resigned as head coach of the University of Illinois at Springfield to become the Director of Player Development and Video Operations for Providence College under head coach Keno Davis, whose father Tom Davis formerly coached Gamble at Iowa. In April 2012, Gamble joined Davis to be an assistant coach at Central Michigan. On September 5, 2018, it was announced that Gamble was resigning from CMU to take a scouting position with the Toronto Raptors.https://cmuchippewas.com/sports/mens- basketball/roster/coaches/kevin-gamble/353 Head coaching record References External links *Statistics at Basketball-Reference.com *NBA player profile (archived from 1998) *2004 Boston Globe article on Gamble *2005 interview 1965 births Living people American expatriate basketball people in the Philippines American men's basketball coaches American men's basketball players Barangay Ginebra San Miguel players Basketball coaches from Illinois Basketball players from Illinois Boston Celtics players Central Michigan Chippewas men's basketball coaches Iowa Hawkeyes men's basketball players Lincoln Lynx basketball players Portland Trail Blazers draft picks Portland Trail Blazers players Providence Friars men's basketball coaches Miami Heat players Quad City Thunder players Sacramento Kings players Shooting guards Small forwards Sportspeople from Springfield, Illinois University of Illinois at Springfield ","title":"Kevin Gamble"},{"id":"4315352","text":"The parrot-billed sparrow (Passer gongonensis) is found in the arid lowlands of eastern Africa.

Origin, evolution and demise The Ancylus Lake replaced the Yoldia Sea after the latter had been severed from its saline intake across a seaway along the Central Swedish lowland, roughly between Gothenburg and Stockholm. The cutoff was the result of isostatic rise being faster than the concurrent post-glacial sea level rise. In the words of Svante Björck the Ancylus Lake \\"is perhaps the most enigmatic (and discussed) of the many Baltic stages\\". The lake's outlet and elevation relative to sea-level was for long time surrounded by controversy. It is now known that the lake was above sea level, included Lake Vänern, and drained westward through three outlets at Göta Älv, Uddevalla and Otteid. As result of the continued isostatic uplift of Sweden, the outlets in central Sweden were severed. In turn this resulted in the lake tipping over a till substrate at what is now the Great Belt in Denmark. Being located no less than 10 m above sea level the lake began thus to drain to the sea by the so- called Dana River between 9000 and 8900 years B.P. The forming of Dana River is thought to have caused a dramatic erosion of sediments, peatlands and forests along its way. This led initially to a relatively rapid fall in the lake level over hundreds of years to then continue at a lower pace. Another consequence of the lowering of the lake and isostatic uplift was that a north- south land bridge formed between Lake Vänern and the Ancylus Lake effectively making Lake Vänern a separate basin. The Ancylus Lake existed approximately from 9500 to 8000 years B.P. calibrated, during the full Boreal period. The lake became the Littorina Sea when rising sea levels broke through the Dana River forming the Great Belt. This transformation was gradual as salt-water had begun to enter the Ancylus Lake 8800 years B.P. The salt-water that entered the lake diluted constituting episodic brackish water pulses. The proper end of the Ancylus Lake came however 7800–7200 year B.P. when Øresund was flooded causing a massive inflow of salt-water. Shorelines of Ancylus Lake can be found today at c. 60 m above sea level in southern Finland and at c. 200 m near the northern Gulf of Bothnia. Research history =Discovery= strait within the lake while Göta älv formed an outlet to the Atlantic Sea. In 1887 Henrik Munthe was the first geologist to draw the conclusion that the Baltic Sea must once have been a freshwater lake. Munthe did so after finding fossils of the snail Ancylus fluviatilis in sediments. While these fossils were also found slightly before him by other geologists they thought they belonged to rivers, small former lakes or brackish water, failing thus to realize the existence of the lake. Geologists had until then subscribed to a simple scheme for the evolution of the Baltic Sea where small local ice-lakes were succeeded by the Yoldia Sea that then evolved directly to the Littorina Sea. The lake was named by Gerard De Geer in 1890 after the fossils. =Controversy= The lack of an obvious outlet of the lake led to intermittent debates involving not only Munthe and De Geer but also Ernst Antevs, Arvid Högbom, Axel Gavelin, N.O. Holst and H. Hedström. As the outlet was lacking there were doubts on whether Lake Vänern had been part of the lake or not, and on the position of its outlet or whether an outlet actually existed considering the lake could have been at sea level. Lennart von Post discovered by accident a small canyon near Degerfors in 1923 which he thought could be the elusive outlet. This came with time to be known as Svea River. Von Post collaborated initially with Munthe to study Svea River but their collaboration fell apart by 1927 over personal issues. The idea that the Svea River canyon was the outlet of the Ancylus Lake gradually lost ground by the works of Sten Florin, Astrid Cleve and Curt Fredén. In 1927 Cleve who was already \\"an outcast of the geological community\\" commented in an opinion piece in Svenska Dagbladet on a proposal of making Svea River a national monument. She supported the idea of protecting the area but criticized the established interpretation of Munthe and von Post. Munthe replied in Dagens Nyheter and the debate went over to a personal quarrel in two more newspaper letters in January 1928. Cleve outlined her ideas for Svea River and Ancylus Lake in detail in 1930 making an alternative and intricate theory involving tectonic movements. By 1946 she had changed mind as she then proposed an altogether different theory claiming the Svea River canyons and potholes formed by subglacial drainage and had nothing to do with the Ancylus Lake. Svea River was finally dismissed in 1981 when potholes there were found to predate the lake. The demise of Svea River led authors in the late 1970s and 1980s to revisit the idea that the fresh-water Ancylus Lake was at sea level. Further studies confirmed then that Vänern was part of the lake and that it was above sea level, dismissing the idea of a sea-level lake a second time.

The Classic took the place of the Rambler Six and Rambler Rebel V-8 names, which were retired at the end of the 1960 model year. Introduced a six- passenger four-door sedan and station wagon versions, additional body styles were added. Two-door models became available as a \\"post\\" sedan in 1964 as well as a sporty pillar-less hardtop. A convertible was also available for 1965 and 1966. Motor Trend magazine selected AMC's Classic line as Car of the Year award for 1963. The Rebel name replaced Classic on AMC's completely redesigned intermediate-sized cars for the 1967 model year, and for 1968 the Rambler Rebel line was renamed the AMC Rebel as AMC began the process of phasing out the Rambler marque. Throughout its life in the AMC model line-up, the Classic was the high-volume seller for the independent automaker.  First generation  The Rambler was the focus of AMC's management strategy under the leadership of George W. Romney. American Motors designed and built some of the most fuel- efficient, best-styled and well-made cars of the 1950s and 1960s. Their compact cars (for the era) helped AMC to achieve sales and corporate profit successes. In 1961, the Rambler marque ranked in third place among domestic automobile sales. Ramblers were available in two sizes and built on different automobile platforms. The larger-sized Rambler series was based on a 1956 design and was renamed as the Classic for the 1961 model year to help create a stronger individual identity and contrast from the smaller Rambler American line. American Motors' Edmund E. Anderson designed the new wheelbase Ramblers \\"that looked new and fresh, but were in fact inexpensive reskinned models.\\" = 1961 = 1961 Rambler Classic sedan The 1961 Classic featured a new front end with a one-piece, rectangular extruded-aluminum grille, new fenders, hood, sculptured door panels, and side trim, as well as one-piece bumpers. Models included the Deluxe, the Super, and the Custom (featuring bucket seats in a four-door sedan). The suggested retail price for the basic Deluxe four-door sedan was US$2,098 and was only $339 more for a station wagon. In 1961, the Classic was available in either an I6 - - or with a V8 - - engine. A lighter by aluminum block version of the OHV I6 engine, sometimes referred to as the 196, was offered as an option on Deluxe and Super models. The die cast block features iron \\"sleeves\\" or cylinder liners with a cast iron alloy cylinder head and produces the same as the cast iron version. American Motors \\"defied the detractors\\" with its emphasis on economical and compact-sized cars achieving a sales total of 370,600 vehicles in 1961, \\"lifting the Rambler to an unprecedented third place in the charts behind Chevrolet and Ford\\". = 1962 = 1962 Rambler Classic 4-door sedan For the 1962 model year, the Super models were dropped and replaced by a 400 model. Also for 1962, AMC's flagship Ambassador models were shortened to the same wheelbase as the Classic's at the same time as the V8 engine was no longer available in the Classic models. This meant the Ambassador models were the only models with V8s in the AMC lineup. The two-door sedan bodystyle Rambler Classic was a unique one year offering for 1962. The front grille was modified for 1962, but the free-standing Rambler lettering in the lower center remained. The revised rear end received new round tail lamps, while the previous tailfins were \\"shaved off\\". Rambler was one of the last cars to incorporate the tail fin design and became one of the first to \\"do away with them, and to build clean, simple, uncluttered cars.\\" The back door upper window points were also rounded off for 1962. Starting in 1962, AMC took a leadership role with safer brake systems in all Ramblers featuring twin-circuit brakes, a design offered by only a few cars at that time. Classics with an automatic transmission continued to use push- buttons mounted on the left side of the dashboard with a separate sliding pull tab for the \\"park\\" position. The cast-iron block six-cylinder engine was standard on Deluxe and Custom models with the aluminum version optional. The 400 received the aluminum block, but the cast-iron was a no cost option. Other improvements for 1962 included a price cut of $176 on the popular Custom Classic sedan. The popularity of the compact-sized Classic continued in the face of a dozen new competitors. Sales of the 1962 model year Classics increased by over 56,000 in the first six months compared to the same period in 1961. A Popular Mechanics nationwide survey of owners that had driven a total of revealed that the Rambler is likeable, easy handling, providing stability and comfortable, roomy ride with low-cost operation. Flaws included inadequate power and poor workmanship.  Centaur  American Motors highlighted the Rambler Centaur at the 1962 Chicago Auto Show on a raised platform in the center of automaker's exhibit area. The car was based on a two-door sedan that did \\"not look remarkably different from regular production models.\\"  Second generation  For the 1963 model year, the Rambler Classic line was completely redesigned with subtle body sculpturing. Outgoing design director, Edmund E. Anderson, shaped the Classic that was named Motor Trend magazine's 1963 \\"Car of the Year.\\" These were also the first AMC models that were influenced by Dick Teague, the company's new principal designer. He \\"turned these economical cars into smooth, streamlined beauties with tons of options and V-8 pep.\\" Being of a suitable size for international markets, this Rambler was assembled in a number of countries. In Europe, Renault built this car in their Haren, Belgium plant and marketed it as a luxury car, filling the gap above the tiny Renault Dauphine. The 1963 Classics were also the first all-new cars developed by AMC since 1956. Keeping the philosophy of the company, they were more compact – shorter and narrower by one inch (25 mm), as well as over two inches (56 mm) lower – than the preceding models; but lost none of their \\"family-sized\\" passenger room or luggage capacity featuring a longer wheelbase. = 1963 = 1963 Rambler Classic 770 sedan American Motors' \\"senior\\" cars (Classic and Ambassador) shared the same wheelbase and body parts, with only trim differences and standard equipment levels to distinguish the models. Classics came in pillared two- and four-door sedans, as well as four-door wagons. The model designations now became \\"a Mercedes-like three- number model designation\\" going from the lowest 550 (essentially fleet cars), 660, to highest 770 trims (replacing the Deluxe, Custom, and 400 versions). As in 1962, the 1963 Classics were initially available only as 6-cylinder models. The Ambassador's standard V8 power, featuring AMC's engine, was the chief distinguishing feature from the Classic model line. In mid-1963, a new V8 option was announced for the Classic models. The V8 equipped Rambler Classics combined good performance with good mileage; even with the optional \\"Flash-O- Matic\\" automatic transmission, they reached 0 to 60 mph (0 to 97 km/h) in about 10 seconds and returned fuel economy from to . The new AMC cars incorporated numerous engineering solutions. Among these was curved side glass, one of the earliest popular-priced cars with this feature. Another engineering breakthrough was combining separate parts in the monocoque (unit construction) body into single stampings. One example was the \\"uniside\\" door surround that was made from a single stamping of steel. Not only did it replace 52 parts and reduce weight and assembly costs, it also increased structural rigidity and provided for better fitting of the doors. American Motors' imaginative engineering prompted Motor Trend magazine to give the Classic – and the similar Ambassador models – their Car of the Year award for 1963. Motor Trend's \\"award is based on pure progress in design, we like to make sure the car is also worthy of the title in the critical areas of performance, dependability, value, and potential buyer satisfaction.\\" = 1964 = 1964 Rambler Classic 770 wagon The 1964 model year Classics, were refined with stainless steel rocker moldings, a flush single-plane aluminum grille replacing the previous year's deep concave design, and oval tail-lamps replacing the flush mounted lenses of the 1963's. Classics with bucket seats and V8 engine could be ordered with a new \\"Shift-Command\\" three-speed automatic transmission mounted on the center console that could be shifted manually. A new two-door model joined the line only available in the top 770 trim. The pillar-less hardtop offered a large glass area, and \\"its sales were brisk.\\" A sporty 770-H version featured individually adjustable reclining bucket seats, as well as center a console. Consumers continued to perceive Ramblers as economy cars and the six-cylinder models outsold V8-powered versions.  Typhoon  1964 Rambler Typhoon two-door hardtop American Motors unveiled the Typhoon in April 1964. This mid-1964 model year introduction was a sporty variant of the Classic 770 2-door hardtop. This special model was introduced to highlight AMC's completely new short-stroke, seven main bearing, 8.5:1 compression ratio \\"Typhoon\\" modern era inline-6. Production of this commemorative model was limited to 2,520 units and it was only available in a two-tone Solar Yellow body with a Classic Black roof, and a sporty all-vinyl interior for US$2,509. The car also featured a distinctive \\"Typhoon\\" script in place of the usual \\"Classic\\" name insignia, as well as a unique grille with black out accents. All other AMC options (except engine choices and colors) were available on the Typhoon. The engine became the mainstay six-cylinder engine for AMC and Jeep vehicles. It was produced, albeit in a modified form, up until 2006. The 232 I6 engine's name was soon changed to \\"Torque Command\\", with Typhoon to describe AMC's new line of V8s introduced in 1966.  Cheyenne  The 1964 Chicago Auto Show was used by AMC to exhibit the Rambler Cheyenne in a viewing area made from knotty pine planks. The show car was based on the top-of-the-line Classic Cross Country station wagon finished in white highlighting its full-length gold-tone anodized aluminum trim along the upper part of the bodysides (replacing the side spear that was standard on 770 models) as well as matching gold trim on the lower part of the tailgate between the tail-lights. This was one of AMC's concepts displayed at the Chicago Show that included the Rambler Tarpon fastback and the Rambler Carrousel convertible, but the Cheyenne was likely most significant because AMC \\"did lots of specially trimmed, production-based show cars in its day\\" given the large number of station wagon models it sold.  Third generation  The 1965 model year Classics underwent a major redesign of the new platform that was introduced in 1963; essentially the 1963–1964 design with a rectilinear reskin similar to that of concurrent Ambassadors. Fresh sheet metal design was applied to the original wheelbase and long integral body-frame with only the roof, doors, and windshield as carryovers. Unchanged was the suspension system including a torque tube with coil springs with a Panhard rod. The Rambler Classic was now shorter than – as well as visually distinctive from – the Ambassador line, while still sharing the basic body structure from the windshield back. For the first time a convertible model was available in the 770 trim version. The two-door sedan was dropped from the 770 model lineup. = 1965 = 1965 Rambler Classic 770 sedan The 1965 Classic models were billed as the \\"Sensible Spectaculars,\\" with emphasis on their new styling, powerful engines, and their expanded comfort and sports- type options, in contrast to the previous \\"economy car\\" image. American Motors now only offered its modern straight-six engine design, retiring the aging versions. The 1965 Classic base 550 models featured the modern and economical six-cylinder, which was basically a destroked 232 engine. The 660 and 770 series received the six, while a version was optional. Additionally, the or V8 engines were optional. Popular Science magazine reported, \\"you can have a 1965 Classic as a penny-pinching economy car or a storming performance job.\\" Additional performance options for 1965 included power front disk brakes with four-piston calipers that were supplied by Bendix. The standard 4-wheel drum brakes also continued to feature AMC's \\"Double-Safety\\" master cylinder system. The dual master cylinder was available in only one \\"Big Three\\" car: Cadillac.  Marlin  On March 1, 1965, during the middle of the model year, AMC introduced the Rambler Marlin, a halo car for the company. The fastback design used the Rambler Classic platform. Marketed as a personal luxury car, the Marlin had unique styling and featured an exceptional array of standard equipment.  Rambler Hialeah  A specially prepared Classic two-door hardtop was campaigned for the 1965 auto show circuit. The exterior was finished in yellow pearlescent paint. It was the interior treatment that differentiated the concept car with its yellow and green \\"Hialeah Plaid\\" trim. The door panels and bucket seat bolsters were genuine leather while the seats featured yellow and green plaid silk cloth inserts that were woven in Thailand. The same material was also used for the dresses worn by the models that stood by the cars during auto show days. Public reaction to the tartan interior design was favorable. This market study resulted in AMC offering a new large plaid custom fabric upholstery - along with two matching throw pillows - as an option for the 1966 Classic Rebel hardtop model. = 1966 = 1966 Rambler Classic 770 sedan The 1966 model year Rambler Classics received minor trim changes and additional standard safety features, including padded dash and visors, left outside mirror, as well as seat belts for the front and rear passengers. The 660 mid-trim level was dropped leaving the 550 and 770 models for 1966. Available for the first time was a floor mounted four-speed manual transmission and a dash-mounted tachometer. Classics received particular attention to the styling of the roofs for 1966. The two-door hardtop models received a rectangular rear window and more formal and angular \\"crisp-line\\" roofline that could be covered with vinyl trim. Sedans had an optional trim-outlined \\"halo\\" roof accent color. The station wagon's roof area over the cargo compartment was at the same level with the rest of the roof, no longer dipped down as in prior years. The wagons carried Cross Country insignia and featured of cargo space, as well as a standard roof rack. Two wagon seating capacities were available: a standard six-passenger version with two-rows of seats with a drop-down bottom-hinged tailgate incorporating a fully retracting rear window for accessing cargo, or in an optional eight- passenger version with three-rows of seats (the third rear-facing) and a left- side hinged rear fifth door. The name Classic was no longer considered a positive factor in the marketplace and AMC began reshuffling model names in 1966.  Rambler Rebel  1966 Rambler Rebel 2-door hardtop A top-of-the- line version of the two-door hardtop Classic was offered under the historic Rambler Rebel name. It replaced the 770-H and featured special badges and standard slim-type bucket seats with optional checked upholstery with two matching pillows. Public reaction to the tartan touch appearing in some of AMC's \\"Project IV\\" automobile show tour cars, was judged favorable enough to make the unique trim available on the Rebel hardtop. Serving as one example to verify how AMC products were routinely derided by various automotive press, Popular Science magazine wrote that the new \\"Rambler Rebel reveals a sudden interest in performance,\\" but its handling package cannot overcome the car's obsolete suspension design. However, AMC was reluctant to forfeit their Nash engineered suspension design which employed a strut type front and panhard rod controlled torque tube rear drive system, both having long coil springs to place the upper spring seats higher into the body of the car. This feature was to afford a softer ride quality and better handling by reducing the geometrical leverage of the car's center of gravity for less body roll \\"sway\\" in cornering. What was labeled as \\"obsolete\\" is juxtaposed by noting how General Motors employed a similar suspension system on their third generation Camaro and Firebird nearly twenty years later which had MacPherson strut front and a torque arm mounted rear drive axle.  Rambler St. Moritz  A customized show car was displayed along production models during the 1966 automobile show circuit, the snow- and ski-themed Rambler St. Moritz station wagon. The wagon with three rows of seats featured tinted rear side \\"observation\\" windows that curved up and over into the roof. The remaining roof over the cargo area was finished with polished stainless steel and equipped with a special ski rack. The exterior was a light ice-blue pearlescent paint, while the car's dark blue interior featured Corfam upholstery with a metallic thread embroidered snowflake in each seat back.  International markets  In addition to outright exports from the U.S., AMC was involved in several overseas business ventures involving the production of Rambler Classics that were marketed in various international markets. = Canada = American Motors established a vehicle assembly plant in Brampton, Ontario, Canada in 1961 to assemble AMC vehicles for the Canadian market. With Canada being a Commonwealth country, the Brampton plant also undertook to export complete vehicles to right-hand-drive markets including the United Kingdom. For example, records for the Brampton plant show that 129 RHD Rambler Americans and 255 RHD Rambler Classics were exported in 1964 of which the majority were exported to the United Kingdom. = Argentina = IKA Rambler Cross Country in Argentina Industrias Kaiser Argentina (IKA) produced Rambler Classics in Córdoba, Argentina from 1962 to 1971. Throughout its production, the four-door sedan and station wagon models were produced, with the sedan being sold as the \\"Classic\\" and the station wagon being sold by the name \\"Cross Country.\\" Each car received a numerical nomenclature, depending on the level of equipment: \\"400\\", \\"440\\", \\"550\\", \\"660\\" and \\"990\\". All were powered by the overhead camshaft (OHC) straight-six \\"Tornado Interceptor\\" engines that were originally developed by Kaiser Motors in the U.S. for the 1963 Wagoneer vehicles. This engine was later produced in Argentina and increased the domestic (local sourced) content of the automobiles to gain tariff concessions for the imported components from AMC. In 1963, the best-selling model in Argentina was the IKA Rambler. A road test of an IKA Rambler Classic 660 by the Argentinean automotive magazine, Revista Parabrisas, described significant differences to the 1962 versions, noting the new stylized simple lines and more fluid design, as well as concluding that it is \\"a large and comfortable ride for both the city and touring, as well as – depending on the driver – can be sporty.\\" = Australia = Right-hand-drive 1966 Rambler Classic 770 in Australia Rambler Classics were assembled by Australian Motor Industries (AMI) in Australia from 1961. They were produced from semi Knock-down (SKD) kits. The vehicles were partially assembled and painted at AMC's Kenosha, Wisconsin, factory. They were built with right-hand drive and the body had the engine, transmission, front suspension, rear axle, and doors installed. Some of the other components were boxed and shipped inside the car for final assembly by AMI. Interior components such as upholstery and various other parts were locally sourced to get import tariff concessions. Australian cars were also fitted with amber rear turn signal lights to comply with safety standards in Australia. The Australian-assembled versions were identical in appearance to the U.S. models through the three generations. The base prices of Rambler Classics dropped with the introduction of the redesigned 1963 models due to the elimination of some standard equipment such as the reclining front seats and heater. Two four-door body styles were available: sedan and station wagon. A Classic sedan was offered in Australia for the first time with a manual transmission. However, the biggest selling model was the six-cylinder Classic sedan with an automatic transmission. The AMI Rambler Classics exhibited high standards of assembly and finish. Additionally, the Brampton, Ontario AMC plant in Canada sent 8 fully assembled, right-hand-drive Classic 770 hardtops to Australia in 1964 and 1965. AMI also acted as the State distributor for Ramblers for Victoria. Rambler sales for New South Wales were managed by Sydney company Grenville Motors Pty Ltd, which were also the State distributor of Rover and Land Rover. A network of Sydney and country NSW dealers were controlled by Grenville which was in direct communication with AMI.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&dat;=19640505&id;=7QtiAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=TuYDAAAAIBAJ&pg;=5880,1487150&hl;=enhttp://theamcforum.com/forum/ami- amc-rambler-history-facts-figures-photos_topic47226&OB;=DESC_page7.html Australian Capital Territory sales were managed by Betterview Pty Ltd in Canberra. Annand & Thompson Pty Ltd in Brisbane distributed Rambler vehicles for Queensland. South Australian sales were managed by Champions Pty Ltd in Adelaide. Premier Motors Pty Ltd in Perth distributed Ramblers for Western Australia, and Heathco Motors in Launceston distributed Rambler vehicles for Tasmania.https://www.flickr.com/photos/aussiefordadverts/17005420312/in/photolist- rUHdZW-Ts2WLm-2dJZ2Ry-VEHSQY-Xwqp7Z-SGNVML-2eLhcFo-28GAo6R-2ds7q6T-5mYENE- FYr8ru-sGcfvB-2g68dSS-2cAfnzv-QspSUh-YYrU5Q-fEDVvK-2ecXwRF- NPZKBH-8JsbWQ-J5WXDi-2gmg3Bq-WFmKdZ-28Z9vEN-Vuq9jt-28Z9wb7-RJVRQW-Cwoooj- WC2TtJ-21qLgaL-2eLheXh-RtCbgN-2iqa8bQ-2eQTCXv-qzBagB-2dnvPTf-2cAeoRv-2cAeyhe- fuECs7-GPQb8o-4TLhjK-C1mj2E-BZ7H3Z-2g63cXh-tD8svz-28LMUDz-BZ8KF2-yLe5Wm- JcxeLt-CVuNE1 =New Zealand = Right-hand-drive New Zealand-assembled 1964 Rambler Classic Rambler Classics were assembled by New Zealand company VW Motors in their Volkswagen assembly plant in Otahuhu, Auckland until 1962. In 1964 Campbell Motors, the importer of Studebaker and Willys vehicles, built a plant in Thames, New Zealand to assemble AMC vehicles. Renamed Campbell Motor Industries (CMI), the first car to come off the line was a Rambler Classic in September of 1964. Like Australia, New Zealand cars were assembled from semi knock-down (SKD) kits from Kenosha. The vehicles were partially assembled and painted at the factory. They were built with right-hand drive and the body had the engine, transmission, front suspension, rear axle, and doors installed. Some of the other components were boxed and shipped inside the car for final assembly by CMI. Interior components such as upholstery and various other parts were locally sourced to get import tariff concessions. For 1966, CMI assembled 336 Rambler Classics for the New Zealand market, only slightly fewer than the Datsuns and Peugeots they also assembled in the same year. = Costa Rica = Starting in 1959, Purdy Motor, owned by Xavier Quirós Oreamuno, distributed Rambler vehicles in Costa Rica. Many Central and South American nations established local content regulations during the 1960s. These laws effectively required automobiles sold in those markets to be assembled locally from knock-down kits. A new company, ECASA was established in 1964 by Oreamuno, and by September 1965, the first vehicle to be built in Costa Rica was a 1964 Rambler Classic 660 that still exists. The company assembled Rambler Classics until 1969 and other AMC models until 1974, as well as Toyota's Corona and Land Cruiser. By 1973, Toyota acquired 20% of ECASA. = Europe = 1965 Renault Rambler brochure 1963 Rambler in Germany 1962 Rambler Renault Presidential All three generations of the Rambler Classics were assembled from CKD (Completely Knocked Down) kits by Renault at Renault's Vilvoorde factory in Haren, Belgium beginning in 1962 and sold through Renault dealers in Algeria, Austria, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, The French automaker no longer had a large car in its own model range and the Rambler Classic was sold as an \\"executive car\\" in Renault's markets, and badged as the \\"Rambler Renault\\", under the terms of a cooperation agreement concluded between the two automakers on 21 November 1961. The French coach builder, Henri Chapron, modified 1962 Rambler sedans to serve as a presidential limousines for the government of Charles de Gaulle. Modifications included a custom grille and a single chrome strip the full length of the bodyside, a raised roof, as well as the elimination of the stock panoramic rear window by straight back glass framed by large C-pillars. One objective of Renault, the state-owned automaker at the time, was to recapture the French limousine market segment from Citroën. However, de Gaulle selected the slightly less roomy Citroen. = Mexico = Willys Mexicana S.A. had agreements with AMC to assemble the compact Rambler American models and began preparing for the introduction of the larger Rambler Classic to the Mexican market in 1963. During this time the automaker became Vehiculos Automotores Mexicanos (VAM). This coincided with the launch of the second generation of the U.S. Classic, and the VAM Classic became the second AMC product made by VAM in Mexico. The new model was focused as the luxury companion to the Rambler American compact line and as VAM's flagship automobile as the Ambassador line was not produced in Mexico. A major marketing campaign by VAM promoted the inaugural 1963 models using Motor Trend's Car of the Year award. The VAM Rambler Classic was a success among consumers and the automotive press; obtaining praise for the car's roominess, comfort, beauty of styling, advanced engineering, as well as its economy and value. The 1963 Rambler Classics were available only in two- and four-door sedan body designs, both called Rambler Classic 660. No other trim levels or versions were available. The standard engine and transmission combination was the OHV I6 engine with a single barrel carburetor producing at 4200 rpm with an 8.7:1 compression ratio and coupled to a three-speed manual transmission with column-mounted shifter. The two-barrel version of the 195.6 six was also available at extra cost. Standard equipment for all included built-in flow-through ventilation, four wheel drum brakes with twin-circuits and a double master cylinder, manual steering, electric wipers and washers, coil-spring-based suspension, carpeting, front and rear bench seats consisting of foam rubber and coil springs, side marker lights, hazard lights, backup lights, luxury steering wheel with horn ring and \\"R\\" emblem, 200 km/h speedometer, fuel and water temperature gauges, dual front ashtrays, cigarette lighter, electric clock, AM radio, rearview mirror, front and rear side armrests, dual rear ashtrays, dual coat hooks, round dome light, padded sunvisors, driver's side remote mirror, as well as a bright molding package. Optional equipment included power brakes, power steering, front seatbelts, heater, passenger's side remote mirror, bumper guards, bumper tubes, and full wheel covers. For 1964, the VAM Rambler Classic incorporating the new styling upgrades from its AMC domestic counterpart models. The two-barrel 138 hp version of the 195.6 six became standard. The 1965 model year underwent the styling changes of the U.S. cars. The biggest change was AMC's new seven-main-bearing I6 engine in version as standard equipment and a double barrel version as optional. The new engines were now manufactured in VAM's own factory that was built in 1964 at Lerma, State of Mexico. The new engines replaced the imported L-head and OHV 195.6 engines in VAM's vehicles. The cars saw a name change for 1966, from Rambler Classic 660 to Rambler Classic 770. Despite the \\"trim level\\" upgrade, the car was mostly the same, despite that it did get progressively more luxurious over the years since its introduction. The two-door Rambler Classic 770 featured individual reclining front seats and its marketing focused towards sportiness, marking for the first time a difference between the two body styles other than their number of doors. The VAM Rambler Classic was not available in Mexico as a two-door hardtop, two-door convertible, or four-door station wagon. The Rambler Classic-based Marlin models were also never produced under VAM as also weren't the 1963-1964 Ambassador models based on the same platform. The Rambler Classic model enjoyed popularity and positive image among the Mexican public. For this reason in 1967, with arrival of AMC's completely new Rebel line in the mid-size market segment, VAM continued the Rambler Classic name for its new cars. =Norway= Ramblers were imported into Norway during the 1950s and 1960s by Norwegian importer Kolberg & Caspary AS located at Ås, Norway. Kolberg & Caspary was formed in 1906 and imported automotive, industrial, and construction products.https://translate.google.com.au/translate?sl=no&tl;=en&u;=kcl.no%2F The Rambler Classic was imported from 1963 until 1966, with the majority between 1963 to 1965. A total of 558 cars were brought in to Norway by 1966. Rambler Ambassadors, Americans, and Rebels were also imported in small numbers.https://translate.google.com.au/translate?hl=&sl;=no&tl;=en&u;=http%3A%2F%2Fracn.net%2Fnb%2Fno%2Farkiv%2F56 --sp-504%2F97-statistikk-rambler-i-norge = Philippines = While the Philippines was almost exclusively an American car market until 1941, the post-World War II years saw an influx of European cars enter the market. Despite a saturation of international brands, American Motors Corporation managed to establish a presence and the Rambler Classic and Rambler American were locally assembled by Luzon Machineries Inc. in Manila during the 1960s.https://www.topgear.com.ph/features/feature-articles/Philippine-cars- cost-history-a52-20180209https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/musclecarsphfr/amc- javelin-t1803.html = United Kingdom = Ramblers were imported into the U.K by Rambler Motors (A.M.C) Ltd of Chiswick in West London, the location of which had been used since 1926 for British assembly of Hudson motor vehicles. (Pre-AMC Nash Ramblers were brought in by London company Nash Concessionaires.) U.K vehicles were imported in factory right-hand drive from the Brampton plant in Canada. The dash plaque read “Rambler of Canada.\\" Parts and spares were supplied locally out of the service centre located on Great West Road for the whole of United Kingdom and Europe.https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/september-1964/34/variety  Owners  Former U.S. presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, received his first car in 1965 while he was as a student at Brigham Young University, a used 1963 Rambler Classic from his father, AMC President George W. Romney.  Collectibility  Rambler Classics share numerous parts and components with other AMC models. New parts are somewhat plentiful and several vendors specialize in AMCs. There are also active AMC car clubs to assist owners. \\"Long admired for their simplicity, utilitarian design approach and servicing ease, Ramblers of the early-1960s are an inexpensive way to get into the collector-car hobby.\\" Among the most collectible models are the 1964 Typhoon hardtop and the 1965–1966 Rambler Classic hardtops and convertibles. At collector auctions, Rambler Classics that are in original condition, such as a low-mileage 1965 convertible, will see bidding soaring \\"above condition #1 values\\" with \\"their continued popularity\\".

The dorm is on the northwest corner of the University's main quadrangles at the corner of 57th St. and Ellis Avenue. It is connected via emergency exits to Searle Chemistry Laboratory. Built in 1892 (Snell) and 1901 (Hitchcock), they are the oldest residence halls still in use as such on the university's campus. Snell is built in a Collegiate Gothic style, while Hitchcock is Prairie Style-inspired Gothic. The buildings feature fireplaces and exteriors of limestone, as well as hardwood molding and trim. Snell–Hitchcock is known for having a high level of community spirit and involvement, which are best displayed at the annual University of Chicago Scavenger Hunt. As of 2015, the Snell–Hitchcock team has won 14 of the 29 hunts to date, and holds the longest winning streak (four years) in the history of the game. Hitchcock House's mascot is the armadillo. Snell House's mascot is the tortoise, after being recently changed from a monkey. Hitchcock Hall Hitchcock was built in 1901, and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. It is built in a Collegiate Gothic style, like Snell and most of the University of Chicago's campus, but has many Prairie School elements, such as stone corn husks instead of gargoyles and flat-roofed instead of gabled dormers. Hitchcock is built in the European \\"landing\\" style of dormitory with five stairwells linked through the front cloister and basement, though only the basement is used now in order to ensure that the building is more secure. The three interior \\"sections\\" (Sections II- IV) are each built around a single staircase. Each interior Section consists of two floors of four double-rooms with a fourth floor that has two suites (doubles with a large living room and separate bedroom). Most of the rooms have non-working fireplaces. The first floor houses the apartment for the Resident Deans, a live-in faculty couple. Traditionally, each section has had a women-only and a men-only floor, with the suite floor being either single or mixed-sex depending on the desires of the residents. The outermost sections of Hitchcock (Sections I & V) house primarily upper-class students. They have small hallways with six to eight residents per floor, many in single rooms. Section I is the farthest from the front desk of Hitchcock and each floor is mixed-sex with a shared bathroom. It has some of the largest rooms in Hitchcock Hall, and includes several rooms known as \\"octagons\\" which are located in a turret-like structure and have many windows overlooking 57th and Ellis. The basement entrance to this section opens up into the common area that connects Snell and Hitchcock. Section I also contains \\"horseshoe doubles\\" (room #1x7), large doubles with separate niches and closets for each resident. The horseshoe doubles also have a (nonworking) fireplace and large hearth. Section I was also home to noted astronomer, Emmy award winner, and Pulitzer and Hugo award-winning author Carl Sagan in the 1954–1955 academic year. Section V is built above the Green Room, a large lounge, which is properly known as the Charles Hitchcock Memorial Library. Unlike Section I the first two floors are alternating single-sex (female, then male) with the top floor remaining mixed-sex. Section V has some of the more unusual rooms in Hitchcock, including several which have their own names. On the second floor of section V is the \\"Fermi Room,\\" where Enrico Fermi is said to have lived while working on the Manhattan Project in the 1940s. It is rumored that he chose that room because it had its own bathroom with tub; though the bathroom remains, the tub was replaced with a shower in 2008. Linked to the Fermi Room is the Fermi Blackboard, which is said to be the same blackboard Fermi used to do his calculations, although this may be an urban legend. This possibility does not, nevertheless, detract from many students' desire to possess it. On the fourth floor is \\"The Ranch\\" (room 541), a sprawling single which extends across the north side of the section. It overlooks the Regenstein Library and Ratner Athletic Center and on a clear day the Sears Tower can be seen in the distance. It is usually one of the most sought-after rooms in the House's annual housing lottery. The main lounge in Hitchcock, the Green Room, is a large reading room with tiled floor, a grand piano, a working fireplace, and portraits of namesake Charles Hitchcock, benefactor Annie Hitchcock, and University of Chicago patron Daniel Shorey. Hitchcock also has a kitchen, a bike storage room, and a laundry room. Each section has its own door onto Hitchcock's cloister (known as the Arcade), but the doors are used for exiting only and all entry must be through the main entrance or from Snell. The Snell–Hitchcock front desk and mail room are located in Hitchcock's main entrance. Hitchcock has two assistant resident heads (RAs) and one set of Resident Heads, often a live-in graduate student couple. Snell Hall Snell Hall Built in 1892, Snell is half the size of Hitchcock, housing approximately 50 residents on four floors. It has the distinction of being one of the first women's dorms on a coeducational campus. In the beginning, it only housed women for two quarters; once the intended women's dorm opened, Snell was turned over to the men. All the rooms are singles, except for a two-room suite on the second floor. Three of the four floors are of mixed sexes, while the third floor is women-only. A co-op kitchen, laundry room, and a small recreational room are located in the basement, which connects with Hitchcock Hall. Until 2014, when it was closed, Snell residents could enter the hall through a separate door from the main hall doors. Snell's main lounge is the Tea Room, an oak-paneled room with a non-working fireplace, copious selection of periodicals and, notably to residents, a dog-eared copy of John Rechy's novel The Sexual Outlaw.

A fighter, he took part, from an early age, in the conquests of his father in Sicily. In 1077, at the siege of Trapani, one of two Saracen strongholds remaining in the west of the island, Jordan led a sortie which successfully surprised the guards of the garrison's grazing animals. Its food supply now cut off, the city soon surrendered. He was present at the siege of Taormina in 1079 and, in 1081, with Robert of Sourdeval (or Sourval) and Elias Cartomi (a Saracen turncoat), he retook the city of Catania from the last emir of Syracuse, Ibn Abbad, in another surprise attack. The next year, while his father was away helping Robert Guiscard, his brother the Duke of Apulia, Jordan was left in charge. But in the summer of 1083, Jordan led a few disaffected nobles in rebellion. His father returned and immediately blinded the leaders of the revolt, only pardoning his son at the last moment, to instill in him a healthy respect for authority. He was loyal ever thereafter. On 22 May 1085, the fleet of his father anchored offshore of Jordan's own cavalry forces fifteen mile north of Syracuse. On May 25, the navies of the count and the emir engaged in the harbour and, the emir himself dying in battle, the forces of Roger landed ashore to find Jordan already besieging the city. The siege lasted throughout the summer, but the city eventually capitulated, leaving only Noto still under Saracen dominion. In February 1091, Jordan was present at the siege of that city as well. Jordan was made lord of Noto and count of Syracuse and there he died, of fever, probably in 1092.Jordan undersigned a diploma of his father's in April 1092, though most sources still give him a death in 1091. The 1091 date comes from Goffredo Malaterra and a Palermitan necrology which derives from Malaterra. Despite having inherited all the Hauteville attributes which had made their rule in the Mezzogiorno all but inevitable, he had not been in line for the succession on account of his illegitimacy until his brother Geoffrey became a leper, then he had been designated heir apparent. A stone recording his death can still be seen in the church of Santa Maria in Mili San Pietro,Mili S. Pietro (Messina) near Messina. In 1089, his father arranged his marriage to a daughter of Manfred, brother of Boniface del Vasto. Roger married, at the same time, Adelaide del Vasto, another daughter of Manfred's.

Epicurean works by Amafinius, Rabirius, and Catius were the earliest philosophical treatises written in Latin.Elizabeth Rawson, Intellectual Life in the Late Roman Republic (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985), p. 284. Catius composed a treatise in four books on the physical world and on the highest good (De rerum natura et de summo bono). Cicero credits him, along with the lesser prose stylist Amafinius, with writing accessible texts that popularized Epicurean philosophy among the plebs, or common people.Gian Biagio Conte, Latin Literature: A History, translated by Joseph B. Solodow (The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1999), p. 157 online. Sources In a letter dated January 45 BC, Cicero speaks of Catius as having died recently.Cicero, ad Fam. xv.16 = 215 in D.R. Shackleton Bailey, Epistulae ad familiares (Cambridge University Press, 1977), p. 60. The letter is addressed to Cassius Longinus, one of the future assassins of Julius Caesar and a recent convert to Epicureanism.See article on Cassius for more on his Epicureanism; also Arnaldo Momigliano, review of Science and Politics in the Ancient World by Benjamin Farrington (London 1939), in Journal of Roman Studies 31 (1941) 149–157; Miriam Griffin, “Philosophy, Politics, and Politicians at Rome,” in Philosophia togata: Essays on Philosophy and Roman Society (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989); David Sedley, “The Ethics of Brutus and Cassius,” ‘’Journal of Roman Studies’’ 87 (1997) 41–53. Cicero prods Cassius about his new philosophy, and jokes about spectra Catiana (\\"Catian apparitions\\"), that is, the εἴδωλα or material images which were supposed by the Epicureans to present themselves to the mind and to call up the idea of absent objects: Although Cicero's purpose is ridicule, the passage is an important source for understanding the Epicurean theory of vision.Miriam T. Griffin, \\"Philosophical Badinage in Cicero's Letters to His Friends,\\" in Cicero the Philosopher, edited by J.G.F. Powell (Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 343 online. Catius's spectrum is equivalent to simulacrum in Lucretius,Miriam T. Griffin, \\"Philosophical Badinage,\\" in Cicero the Philosopher, p. 295. but the term spectrum does not appear again in Latin until the 17th century and must represent Catius's attempt to create a specialized vocabulary.David Sedley, Lucretius and the Transformation of Greek Wisdom (Cambridge University Press, 2003), p. 39 online; Robert D. Brown, Lucretius on Love and Sex (Brill, 1987), p. 175 online. Quintilian characterizes Catius briefly: Early commentators on Horace assert that the philosopher should be identified with the Catius addressed in the fourth satire of the poet's second book. This Catius is introduced as delivering a grave and sententious lecture on various topics connected with the pleasures of the table. It appears from the words of Cicero, however, that the satire in question could not have been written until several years after the death of Catius. Horace may have intended to designate some gourmand of the court under a recognizably Epicurean nickname; given the poet's own Epicurean leanings, the passage should probably be read as a parody of the kind of false Epicureanism that disguised mere hedonism.Emily Gowers, The Loaded Table: Representations of Food in Roman Literature (Oxford University Press, 1996), p. 141 online.

He probably lived in the late 2nd and early 1st century BC.Smith, M., (2001), On the Nature of Things, page x. Hackett Publishing. He wrote several works, which are censured by Cicero as deficient in arrangement and style. He is mentioned by no other ancient writer but Cicero.Cicero, Academica, i. 2, Tusculanae Quaestiones, iv. 3. In the Academica, Cicero reveals that Amafanius translated the Greek concept of atoms as \\"corpuscles\\" (corpusculi) in Latin. In his Tusculan Disputations, Cicero disapprovingly notes that Amafanius was one of the first philosophers writing in Latin at Rome:Cicero, Tusculan Disputations: (C)um interim illis silentibus C.

In his Academica, Cicero criticizes Amafinius and his fellow Epicurean Rabirius for their unsophisticated prose style, and says that in their efforts to introduce philosophy to common people they end up saying nothing.

The games are preceded most weeks by the studio show Baseball Tonight: Sunday Night Countdown presented by Chevrolet prior to the first pitch. A few telecasts each season appear on ESPN2 rather than ESPN due to conflicts with other programming. History Former logo used until 2017 The series debuted in 1990, and from its inception through 2010 featured the broadcast team of play-by-play commentator Jon Miller and color commentator Joe Morgan. Steve Phillips joined them for the 2009 season, and Orel Hershiser did so for the 2010 season following Phillips' dismissal by the network.http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=4965563 From 2004 until 2006, Sam Ryan served as the field reporter, but she left to join New York City's WCBS-TV and CBS Sports in June 2006. On July 2, 2006 Bonnie Bernstein joined the crew as the new field reporter, but did not return in 2007 primarily due to her request to cut back her schedule because of her continued recovery from a bout with deep vein thrombosis in October 2006. Beginning in 2006, Peter Gammons joined the broadcasts as a field reporter in the scouts position. Gammons, however, suffered a brain aneurysm and didn't return until September 2006. In 2010, Miller and Morgan began their 21st consecutive season working together for ESPN. Among U.S. network television sportscasters, only Pat Summerall and John Madden (who called NFL games for CBS and Fox from 1981 to 2001) have had a similar length partnership in the booth. Following the 2010 season, ESPN announced that the television contracts of Miller and Morgan would not be renewed. Miller was offered, but chose to decline, a continued role with ESPN Radio. Play-by-play announcer Dan Shulman joined color commentators Hershiser and Bobby Valentine as the new Sunday Night Baseball crew beginning in 2011. In an essential trade deal, following the hiring of Valentine as the Boston Red Sox manager, his predecessor Terry Francona was hired to join Shulman and Hershiser for the 2012 season. Francona stayed with ESPN for only one season before he was hired by the Cleveland Indians to be their manager for the 2013 season. Francona was replaced by John Kruk, who had been part of the Baseball Tonight team since 2004. Like Miller and Morgan before them, Shulman and Hershiser also formed the lead team on ESPN Radio's World Series coverage. Prior to the 2014 season, Hershiser left ESPN to become an analyst for the Dodgers on SportsNet LA, and was replaced by Curt Schilling; however, Schilling's subsequent diagnosis of and treatment for an undisclosed form of cancer led to his being unavailable to ESPN for most of the season. Shulman and Kruk worked as a two-man booth until Schilling joined them in September. On August 30, 2015, former softball player Jessica Mendoza joined the Sunday Night Baseball broadcast team as a color commentator. For the 2016 MLB season, former Yankees player Aaron Boone joined Shulman and Mendoza in the broadcast booth as the second color commentator for SNB. Shulman stepped down at the conclusion of the 2017 season, while Boone left the booth after being named new Yankees manager. On January 23, 2018, ESPN announced that Alex Rodriguez and Matt Vasgersian would join the SNB crew for the 2018 season as analyst and play-by-play respectively. For the 2020 season abbreviated due to COVID-19, Vasgersian and Rodriguez will broadcast all games from a studio at ESPN's Bristol, Connecticut headquarters. =Notable games aired on Sunday Night Baseball= :2000s: On May 28, 2000, Pedro Martínez and Roger Clemens faced off in an epic pitchers duel at Yankee Stadium. Both pitchers threw complete games and combined for 22 strikeouts, 13 for Clemens, 9 for Martinez. The game was scoreless until Trot Nixon hit a two run home run in the top of the ninth inning. Martinez then got the final three outs in the bottom of the inning to secure the victory. ESPN was on hand for the Cleveland Indians' historic comeback against the Seattle Mariners on August 5, 2001. The Indians trailed 14-2 after six innings, but scored twelve runs in the final three innings before winning in the bottom of the eleventh, 15-14. The twelve-run comeback tied the Major League record for largest deficit overcome in a game. On September 2, 2001, Mike Mussina of the New York Yankees came within one strike of a perfect game against the Boston Red Sox. The effort was broken up on a single by Carl Everett, with Mussina settling for a one-hitter. The game itself was an exciting pitchers' duel, with the Red Sox' David Cone also shutting out the Yankees for eight innings, before allowing an RBI double by Enrique Wilson in the ninth. It was the only scoring of the Yankees' 1-0 win. Additionally, Cone was the most recent pitcher to record a perfect game having done so two years earlier as a Yankee against the Montreal Expos. On June 16, 2002, Sunday Night Baseball covered a Subway Series at Shea Stadium in which Mo Vaughn hit a game winning three-run home run in the New York Mets' 3-2 win over the New York Yankees. Rafael Furcal completed an unassisted triple play for the Atlanta Braves against the St. Louis Cardinals on August 10, 2003. It was the 12th such play in baseball history. In the fifth inning, the shortstop caught pitcher Woody Williams' liner with the runners moving in a hit and run attempt, stepped on second base to retire catcher Mike Matheny and tagged Orlando Palmeiro before he could return to first. On April 22, 2007, the Red Sox became the fifth team in Major League history to hit four consecutive home runs, doing so in the third inning of a 7-6 victory over the Yankees. On April 29, 2007, a canceled broadcast occurred between the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals when Cardinals relief pitcher Josh Hancock was killed in a car accident earlier in the day at 12:35 A.M. while driving under the influence. In place of the game, special programming hosted by Miller and Morgan was shown. The game was later made up on September 10, 2007, where the Cubs defeated the Cardinals 12-3, though the game was not broadcast as the Game of the Week. On August 5, 2007, Tom Glavine of the New York Mets became the 23rd pitcher in history to record his 300th win. He did it in an 8-3 victory over the Chicago Cubs. Sunday Night Baseball broadcast the Washington Nationals' very first game at Nationals Park on March 30, 2008. The Nationals beat the Atlanta Braves, 3-2, on Ryan Zimmerman's walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth. President George W. Bush, who threw out the ceremonial first pitch prior to the game, joined Jon Miller and Joe Morgan in the ESPN booth during the telecast. The final game played at Yankee Stadium on September 21, 2008, pitting the New York Yankees against the Baltimore Orioles, was broadcast on Sunday Night Baseball. The Mariano Rivera 500th career save (and also his 1st lifetime RBI) was broadcast on Sunday Night Baseball from Citi Field (home of the New York Mets). :2010s: During the May 1, 2011 broadcast between the New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies, ESPN announced the death of Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the September 11 attacks, at the end of the 8th inning. At the top of the 9th inning with 1 out and Daniel Murphy at bat, fans at Citizens Bank Park erupted with U-S-A! chants despite the fact that no announcement of the news had been made in the stadium. Fans learned about the events through social media and mobile news apps. Appropriately, the Mets game against the Chicago Cubs on September 11 was a Sunday night game to mark the tenth anniversary of the attacks. On July 17, 2011, a game between the Boston Red Sox and Tampa Bay Rays went scoreless into the 16th inning before the Red Sox scored in the top of the inning, leading to a 1-0 victory. This game was also notable for a foul ball hit by the Rays' Sean Rodriguez that hit and broke a lamp in the catwalks of Tropicana Field. As the grounds crew cleaned up the broken glass that fell onto the field, the stadium PA system played the music from The Natural. The Chicago Cubs and the Mets at Citi Field on September 11, 2011 was broadcast on Sunday Night Baseball as part of the 10th anniversary of September 11, 2001; New York was targeted by the terrorists in the attacks of that day and the Mets hosted the first major professional sports event held in New York City since the attacks on September 21. On August 30, 2015, during a game between the Chicago Cubs and the Los Angeles Dodgers, Jake Arrieta threw a no-hitter. This was the first no-hitter aired on Sunday Night Baseball. This was the first Sunday Night Baseball game to have a female commentator in the booth, Jessica Mendoza. On July 3, 2016, Sunday Night Baseball aired the Fort Bragg Game, the first professional sporting event held on an active military base, and the first MLB regular season game held in North Carolina. The Miami Marlins defeated the Atlanta Braves, 5-2. On May 7, 2017, during the game between the Chicago Cubs and the New York Yankees, they broke the MLB strikeout record as both teams combined made 48 strikeouts (Yankees 22 and Cubs 26). In addition, the 18-inning game was also the longest interleague game yet in MLB history and longest Sunday Night Baseball game yet broadcast. The Yankees won, 5-4.http://thecomeback.com/mlb/18-inning-cubs-yankees-mlb- record-48-strikeouts.html On August 12, 2018, during a game between the Washington Nationals and the Chicago Cubs, David Bote hit a pinch-hit walk-off grand slam with his team down 3-0 and down to their final strike to give the Cubs a stunning 4-3 victory. Features The telecasts also utilize the K Zone, a computer-generated on-screen graphic that accurately outlines the strike zone and pitch location. A Skycam is also used; it is usually mounted 20 feet above the stands in foul territory and travels back and forth along the first base line from behind home plate to the foul pole.

This version is also presented on the Spanish feed of ESPN Latin America. The Brazilian feed, in Portuguese, has Romulo Mendonça doing the play-by-play and Paulo Antunes as the analyst. They broadcast from ESPN Brasil studios in São Paulo. ESPN Radio has aired a weekly Sunday Night Baseball broadcast since 1998. Currently, Jon Sciambi calls play- by-play of the games, with Chris Singleton serving as color analyst. Sciambi was preceded by Gary Thorne (2008–09), Dan Shulman (2002–07), and Charley Steiner (1998–2001), while Singleton was preceded by Dave Campbell (1999–2010) and Kevin Kennedy (1998). From 1990 to 1997, CBS Radio aired Sunday night games, usually with Jerry Coleman and John Rooney announcing. Outside the USA, this weekly game was also broadcast live on Five in the UK from 1997 until 2008 and at the time was the longest running programme on the channel. In Latin America the game is broadcast on ESPN Latin America. When the NFL season begins, the game is moved to ESPN Dos only for the audience in Mexico, Central America, Venezuela, Colombia and the Caribbean Islands. In Canada, Sunday Night Baseball has aired on the TSN family of channels (usually on TSN2) since May 16, 2010. This was initially under a sublicensing agreement with Sportsnet, the primary Canadian rightsholder for Major League Baseball, in a deal through which TSN transferred its remaining rights to Toronto Blue Jays games to Sportsnet, which is now the exclusive carrier of Blue Jays games, and English-language rightsholder of all post-season games. Beginning in 2014, TSN has contracted directly with MLB for rights to SNB and other ESPN MLB telecasts through 2021. Sportsnet may still air individual games in the event of a scheduling conflict between all of TSN's channels. Previous carriers of Sunday Night Baseball were TSN (1990-2000), The Score (2001-2002), and Sportsnet (2003-May 9, 2010). In French, the program is carried on Réseau des Sports with Alain Usereau and Marc Griffin working as the announcers.

He specialized in Ancient Near East Archaeology, and became professor emeritus at the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago. He was also a pioneer in using aerial photography in archaeological research. Biography When he was young, his father died, and Erich was sent to the military school (Kadettenkorps) in Karlsruhe. He graduated in 1914 as a lieutenant in the German Army just as WWI started. He fought in the war with distinction, but then was seriously wounded in the fighting in Austrian Galicia in 1916.He received the Iron Cross of Germany and the golden medal of Wurttemberg for his service. After the battle, Schmidt was found by the Russians on the battle field, and spent the next four years in a prisoner-of-war camp. In 1920, he found his way home to Germany. There he learned that his mother and three siblings died in the meantime. Then he attended Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität (now Humboldt University of Berlin).Erich F. Schmidt - Biography - uchicago.edu In 1923 he moved to U.S., and studied anthropology at Columbia University, where he was a student of Franz Boas. From December 1925 through January 1926, Schmidt conducted stratigraphic test excavations at Pueblo Grande and La Ciudad, two Hohokam sites that he later used for his dissertation. He was one of the pioneers of Hohokam studies. In 1927, James Henry Breasted of the Oriental Institute invited Schmidt to join the Anatolia-Hittite Expedition as an assistant archaeologist. He became co-director of the Oriental Institute Hittite Expedition, with H.H. Von der Osten, and later on dug in sites as Tepe Hissar near Damghan in searching for ancient city Hecatompylos, and Rey. His most celebrated survey took place in Persepolis (Iran), from 1934 up to 1939. Erich Schmidt was pioneer in aerial photography of archaeological sites, especially in Iran. In 1935, Schmidt had to approach Reza Shah Pahlavi directly for permission to fly over the country. After he obtained it, he made many flights and did a lot of mapping.Manu P. Sobti and Sahar Hosseini, \\"Re-examining Persian Civitas: Networked Urbanities and Suburban Hinterlands in Erich Schmidt’s Flights\\". in Historiography of Persian Architecture, ed.

As teenagers, they began writing songs and forming bands, and when attending Kentucky State University, they formed Midnight Star, a synth-funk outfit that hit big in the early 1980s. The Calloways were instrumental in orchestrating the band's 1983 multi-platinum breakthrough album, No Parking on the Dance Floor, and Midnight Star would continue to experience mainstream success throughout the brothers' tenure in the group. After Midnight Star ran its course, the two left to focus on solo work. During their time with Midnight Star, they had also written and produced hits for acts like Klymaxx (\\"Meeting in the Ladies Room\\") and The Whispers (\\"Contagious\\"). Following their exit from Star, they continued writing for other musicians, such as Teddy Pendergrass (\\"Joy\\"), Gladys Knight & the Pips (\\"Love Overboard\\"), Natalie Cole (\\"Jump Start\\"), and Levert (\\"Casanova\\"), before forming their own eponymous group, Calloway, in the late 1980s.

Faucet design Most Moen kitchen, washbasin, and bathtub/shower faucets are of the single-handle design, and almost all have used the same basic water-controlling cartridge from the 1960s until 2010. Known as the Moen 1225, it is a plastic (older versions were brass) cylinder approximately 4 inches long by 3/4 inches in diameter. As the \\"engine\\" in most Moen single-handle faucets, it has undergone at least two revisions since its inception though newer versions remain compatible with older faucets. Pulling up the stem of the cartridge opens the water supply; rotating toward the left opens the hot water passages while rotating to the right opens the cold water passages (using the standard North American convention of the hot water control on the left). Most Moen faucets produced since 2010 use the 1255 Duralast cartridge, which incorporates ceramic disc technology. Later Moen bathtub/shower controls with single handles use a larger cartridge with a pressure balancing mechanism which compensates for sudden pressure changes in either the hot or cold water supply (as caused by a toilet being flushed while someone is showering). The design goal is to maintain the temperature of the shower for safety and comfort reasons, even if the volume of water is reduced. The cartridge is known as the 1222, and is used in all Posi-Temp shower valves. The operation is similar to the 1225 (above), though the cartridge is approximately 1 inch in diameter to allow space for the pressure balancing mechanism.

A Radio Reconnaissance Team (RRT) was assigned as the tactical signals intelligence collection element for the Marine Corps Special Operations Command, Detachment One. Regular RRTs also participate in SOC operations during Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable), or MEU(SOC), deployments. The RRP is not considered to be a Special Missions Unit (SMU) or a true special operations unit, as it does not fall under the banner MARSOC or USSOCOM. Mission The mission of the Radio Reconnaissance Platoon is to conduct tactical yet static signals intelligence and electronic warfare operations in support of the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) commander during advance force, pre-assault, and deep post-assault operations, as well as maritime special purpose operations. Radio Reconnaissance although MEU SOC, should not be confused with the better known and recognizable USMC Force Reconnaissance Units, Battalion Reconnaissance, or MARSOC Raiders. The RRT is used when the use of conventionally trained Radio Battalion elements is inappropriate or not feasible. While deployed with a MEU (SOC), the Radio Reconnaissance Team is also a part of the Maritime Special Purpose Force (MSPF) as a unit of the Reconnaissance & Surveillance Element (MSPF). The MSPF is a sub-element of the MEU(SOC), as a whole, and is responsible for performing specialized maritime missions.

A Sergeant (center) encourages an RRP candidate (right) during the last few yards of the Ruck Run event of the Indoc. =Radio Reconnaissance Instruction Program= The Radio Reconnaissance Instruction Program (RRIP) is the in-house technical training tool used by the RRP to ensure that its Marines are not only tactically proficient in basic reconnaissance skills but technically adept in their respective areas of expertise. The RRIP has a duration of several days that can be dynamically determined to suit the needs of the platoon and its deployment tempo. During the RRIP, an RRP candidate can expect very long and strenuous days. The RRIP culminates in a series of field training exercises (FTX's) from 24 to 72 hours in length. =Advanced training= Advanced training may include: * US Army Ranger School * USMC Mountain Survival Course * USMC Mountain Leader Course * US Army Jumpmaster Course * US Army Reconnaissance & Surveillance Leaders Course (RSLC) * US Army Pathfinder School * Helicopter Rope Suspension Training (HRST) Masters Course * Coxswain Course * Maritime Navigator Course Organization There are currently three Radio Battalions, two with their own RRPs. 1st Radio Battalion, I Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF), is located at Camp Pendleton, California. 2nd Radio Battalion, II Marine Expeditionary Force, is located at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. Owing to a restructuring of the entire Radio Battalion organization, the former 1st Radio Battalion, with its RRP, moved from Marine Corps Base Hawaii in Kāneohe Bay to Camp Pendleton in October 2004. The RRP has since been reestablished in 3rd Radio Battalion, Kaneohe HI. The RRTs of 1st and 3rd Radio Battalions still deploy in support of III MEF's 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit Alpha and Bravo cycles based in Okinawa. 1st Radio Battalion also deploys RRT's in support of I MEF's rotating 11th, 13th and 15th Marine Expeditionary Units. A six-man RRP is typically composed of a Team Leader (Staff Sergeant or Sergeant), Assistant Team Leader (Sergeant or Corporal), Point Man, Navigator, Radio-Telegraph Operator (RTO), and Assistant RTO. History Lt. General Alfred M. Gray, Jr., Commanding General of Fleet Marine Force, Atlantic (FMFLant) and future Commandant of the Marine Corps, and Lt. Col. Bill Keller, Commanding Officer of 2nd Radio Battalion, FMFLant, met at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point in the spring of 1984 to welcome home the returning members of the 2nd Radio Battalion Detachment from Beirut, Lebanon. The Marines of 2ndRadio Battalion had conducted tactical cryptologic operations in support of the entire deployment of the US peacekeeping force in Beirut since the initial landings at Beirut International Airport. During the wait, Gray and Keller were discussing the various problems faced by the Radio Battalion detachment. Both agreed that the most significant problem was the lack of a tactical cryptologic database available from national and theater assets prior to the Marines' landing in Beirut. Equally significant were the unconventional aspects of the communications networks used by the various factions in Beirut. Those that posed the greatest threat to the Marines did not abide by standard military communications procedures, nor did they follow set frequencies or call signs. Because the detachment had received no intelligence from the National Security Agency prior to deployment, they were forced to start from scratch upon arrival in Beirut. General Gray wanted to integrate a Force Reconnaissance team with attached Radio Battalion cryptologists, selected and trained for terrestrial reconnaissance and special operations. He directed Lt. Col. Keller to coordinate with 2nd Force Reconnaissance Company to test this idea. Keller coordinated with the Commanding Officer of 2nd Force Reconnaissance Company, Maj. Joe Crockett. Their initial step was to attach a Radio Battalion Marine, equipped with an AN/GRR-8 receiver to a Force Recon Team during an exercise and see if he could keep up and do something worthwhile. The experiment did not go well, and the concept was tabled until that summer, when Lieutenant Colonel Chuck Gallina became Commanding Officer (CO) of 2nd Radio Bn. General Gray discussed the idea with Gallina, who became a major proponent of the concept. In December 1984, Captain E.L. Gillespie, a J2 SIGINT Operations Officer in Joint Special Operations Command, arrived at Radio Battalion to develop a concept of operations to integrate Radio Battalion Marines with Force Recon teams for independent advance force operations. Captain Gillespie submitted a draft \\"Talking Paper\\" contending that integration with a four-man Force Recon team was not viable due to conflicting missions. He suggested that a separate six-man Radio Bn team be trained in selected airborne and seaborne insertion/extraction techniques, terrestrial reconnaissance, and survival skills. The original mission statement for the team was, \\"To conduct limited communications intelligence and specified electronic warfare operations in support of Force Reconnaissance operations during advance force or special operations missions.'' The initial list of titles for this proposed group was: * Force Reconnaissance Support Team (FRST) * Radio Search Team (RST) * Signal Search Team (SST) * Special Search Team (SST) * Radio Research Team (RRT) * Radio Reconnaissance Team (RRT) General Gray got the list and personally circled the Radio Reconnaissance Team as the official name for the teams. He then directed the CO of Radio Battalion to screen, select, and train the required personnel to deploy two six-man RRT's for a proof of concept operational deployment during the advance force operational phase of Exercise Solid Shield-85. He also ensured that the CO of 2nd Force Reconnaissance Company would assist in the personnel selection, training and equipping, and that II MEF's Solid Shield-85 OPLANS, OPORDERS, and Annexes would adequately reflect the integration of the RRT. Captain Gillespie was directed to immediately commence screening of 2nd Radio Battalion personnel. However, most Radio Battalion Marines did not share the officers' enthusiasm for the project. There was also resistance by Company Commanders, who did not want to allow their best Marines to be assigned to the task. With the exception of the Senior non-commissioned officers and Sergeants, the majority of the Marines provided to form the initial RRT's were \\"malcontents\\" waiting to be discharged. At this time, Major Carrick insisted that all of the RRT candidates must go through the 2nd Force Reconnaissance Company Indoctrination Process (Indoc). Carrick later admitted that the only reason that he insisted on this issue was that he felt that all or most of the Radio Battalion Marines would either quit or fail the Indoc and the project would be put to rest once and for all. However, all of the RRT candidates passed the Indoc. Captain Gillespie later talked to the Indoc instructors, who indicated that they had done everything that they could think of to make the RRT Marines quit, but they wouldn't. After the Indoc, one RRT was sent to Army Airborne School at Fort Benning, Georgia, while the other Marines prepared and trained for Solid Shield-85. The exercise went well, and by all accounts, the Radio Reconnaissance proof of concept was an unqualified success. In 1987, 1st Radio Battalion at MCB Hawaii officially created a Radio Reconnaissance Platoon. Prior to 1987, the battalion had shied away from designating the unit as \\"Radio Reconnaissance\\" for fear of dividing vital resources and creating a separatist culture within the ranks of MEU(SOC) deploying Radio Battalion detachments. 1st RRP Marines trained with Alpha Company, 3rd Reconnaissance Battalion in the initial stages and attended various multi-service schools to perfect their skills. During its first two years, 1st Radio Battalion's RRIP consisted of 4–6 months of training, formal schools, and exercises prior to a Marine achieving certification and being assigned to a team. Between 1986 and 1989, RRT's were deployed as an element of the Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable) Radio Battalion Detachment assigned to each of the rotating 11th, 13th, 15th, 22nd, 24th, and 26th MEU(SOC) deployments. Captain Gillespie was assigned as the officer in charge of the 2nd Radio Battalion Detachment, 24th MEU(SOC) in 1986, which was the first Radio Battalion detachment to conduct real-world operations during Operation Earnest Will (a Kuwaiti oil tanker escort operation). The 24th MEU(SOC) RRT reinforced by members of 1st RRP with specific linguist skills, was involved in significant cryptologic operations in the Persian Gulf and provided intelligence support for several combat actions against Iranian forces, including the seizure of the Iranian mine-laying vessel, Iran Ajr and the incident at Middle Shoals Light. Other RRT personnel were involved in actions in Panama leading to and during Operation Just Cause, the invasion of Panama. In the Pacific Theater, the first certified RRT to participate in real-world operations deployed in 1988–89 as part of the 13th MEU(SOC) Radio Battalion Detachment commanded by First Lieutenant Kirk Kicklighter. Staff Sergeant Scott Laasanen and Sergeant Daniel Stinson served as team leaders during collection missions in support of Australian forces intervening in civil war in Papua New Guinea, as well as intelligence operations against rebel forces seeking to overthrow the newly installed government of President Corazon Aquino in the Republic of the Philippines.

In 1910, Collins played first base for the White Sox, but he was quickly moved to right field, where he developed a reputation for having one of the strongest throwing arms in baseball. He won a World Series with the Sox in 1917, delivering the game-winning hit in the pennant-clinching game. He batted .286 (6 for 21) in the 1917 World Series, going 3-for-4 in Game 1. In 1918, he set a record with three bases-loaded triples in one season, which stood alone for 31 years until Elmer Valo tied the mark in 1949. Collins still holds the MLB career record of eight triples with the bases loaded. During the notorious 1919 World Series, tainted by the Black Sox Scandal, Collins went 4-for-16 at the plate for the White Sox. He was not among those implicated in the scandal. In 1921, he was traded to the Red Sox, with whom he finished his career. In 1930, he was named manager of the Red Sox, but he only won a total of 73 games in parts of two seasons. He was fired after 55 games in 1931. In the indictments of the key figures in the Black Sox scandal, Collins is named as the wronged party.

She was to be successful both in Iceland and in Denmark, where she moved in 1919. By 1924 she had returned to Iceland and that year she married Icelandic sculptor Ásmundur Sveinsson.

Work In 1931, shortly after returning to Iceland, Gunnfríður created her first sculpture, A Dreaming Boy. This was followed by many other works, a good number of them portraits. The National Gallery of Iceland collection contains a number of her works. Her best known sculpture, Land in Sight, carved from Norwegian granite, was dedicated at Strandarkirkja in 1950.

Ranhofer was the author of The Epicurean (1894),Charles Ranhofer (1912) The Epicurean, C. Ranhofer, New York an encyclopedic cookbook of over 1,000 pages, similar in scope to Escoffier's Le Guide Culinaire. Career Ranhofer was sent to Paris at the age of 12 to begin his training by studying pastry-making, and at 16 became the private chef for the Prince d'Hénin, Comte d'Alsace. In 1856 he moved to New York to become the chef for the Russian consul, and later worked in Washington, D.C. and New Orleans. He returned to France in 1860 for a short time, where he arranged balls for the court of Napoleon III at the Tuileries Palace, but then came back to New York to work at what was then a fashionable location, Maison Dorée. In 1862, Lorenzo Delmonico hired him for Delmonico's, and it was there that Ranhofer made his real fame, though others say that he made the fame of the restaurant as well. At that time, Delmonico's was considered the finest restaurant in the United States. He was the chef at Delmonico's until his retirement in 1896, except for a short hiatus from 1876 to 1879 when he owned the Hotel American at Enghien-les-Bains. Recipes frontispiece of the Epicurean Ranhofer is credited (often on slim evidence) with inventing or making famous a number of dishes that Delmonico's was known for, such as Lobster Newberg, and had a talent for naming dishes after famous or prominent people—particularly those who dined at Delmonico's—as well as his friends, and events of the day. Examples include: *Lobster Duke Alexis, named for Grand-Duke Alexis of Russia (later Alexander III) in 1871 *Sarah potatoes, named for Sarah Bernhardt *Lobster Paul Bert, named for Paul Bert *Chicken filets Sadi Carnot, named for Marie François Sadi Carnot *Peach pudding à la Cleveland, named for President Grover Cleveland *Veal pie à la Dickens and Beet fritters à la Dickens, named for Charles Dickens in honor of his 1867 visit to New York (Neither term appears in Ranhofer's own copy of the menu offered for that visit, but Ranhofer does include recipes for both of them.) *Salad à la Dumas, named in honor of Alexandre Dumas, père *Lobster Newberg, named in honor of sea captain Ben Wenberg, then renamed when Wenberg had a falling-out with the restaurant *Marshal Ney, a dessert named in honor of Marshal Ney Others may be found under List of foods named after people. Ranhofer did not invent baked Alaska, nor do the menus he provides in The Epicurean mention anything similar, not even his own Alaska-Florida (the term he himself used for his similar dessert). He also experimented with new foods, acquainting New Yorkers with the \\"alligator pear\\" (avocado) in 1895, among other things. Death Ranhofer and his wife Rose had five children: three sons and two daughters. He died at home of Bright's Disease in 1899 and was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.

It is operated by the Australian Radio Network. History Formerly AM station 2KA, previous station IDs since 1990 include One FM and 9inety6ix.1. The station played Top 40 mainstream CHR (1990–1997, 1999–2005) and Alternative Rock (1998) before its current \\"Hip hop and R&B;\\" phase (2006-). In 1997 the station was sold by Mike Walsh to Australian Radio Network, which currently owns three Sydney radio stations: The Edge 96.One, KIIS 106.5 and WSFM 101.7. Following ARN's purchase, the One FM studio in Penrith was co-located to Seven Hills with WSFM 101.7. In 2002 The Edge 96.One was moved to its present home, now North Ryde, as did WSFM 101.7. Although licensed to Katoomba/Blue Mountains/Penrith, its signal, at 5 kW located at Wentworth Falls, is enough to cover most of the Sydney basin subject to local interference. It can also be heard in some parts of Canberra, Wollongong, Newcastle and Bathurst. The Edge 96.One was taken to court in the 1990s for excessive coverage overspill by 2Day FM and 2MMM. They lost, and The Edge was able to continue broadcasting. AC Nielsen choose not to include its figures in the Sydney Nielsen polls, with its figures forming part of the 'Other' stations in the survey. Because the station is not licensed to serve the Sydney market, ARN can own it as well as the Sydney licensed WSFM 101.7 and KIIS 106.5. In January 2006, ARN decided to launch the first pure urban format radio station in the country, on The Edge. The format change was due to the overwhelming response to the nightly urban count down, \\"Ksera & The Dirty Dozen\\", with Ksera and Kris Fade that culminated in being awarded Best Radio Show Australia and New Zealand at the 2006 Urban Music Awards. To coincide with the new look, The Edge unveiled a new brand and logo to emphasize its place as the Hip Hop and RnB radio station. While The Edge has evolved into a more contemporary hits format with an urban influence, ARN have chosen to capitalize on the established ‘Ksera’ brand, and continue to service the confirmed urban audience in Australia on a national level by launching KseraRadio.com, streaming on-line now. In 2009, The Edge 96.One launched a sister station of the same format on DAB+ in Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney under the name of Edge Digital. The station is a music format based on The Edge 96.One, though not a direct simulcast of that station, but shares resources, including logo and promotions. Edge Digital is not available on Metro FM radio. EDGE Digital In April 2011, The Edge Breakfast welcomed back former announcers Mike E and Emma Chow In August 2013, The Edge rebranded and presented their new music position. While the previous tagline of \\"Live Sexy\\" described the lifestyle associated with The Edge, the new philosophy of \\"Hits That Move You\\" was believed to direct listeners to what they will hear on the station. \\"The Edge is unique in Australian radio as it is the only commercial station running an Urban format. 'Hits that move you' expresses our musical edge and better allows urban music fans to find us.\\" The changes comes after an online poll where listeners were asked to choose a format. They wanted a hybrid of urban, pop, dance and R'n'B. This tag line would be short lived and broaden to not just 'hits' but all forms of urban 'beats'. The Edge is also host of the famous Club Edge show playing Saturday evenings with resident DJs such as Nino Brown at night. In March 2014, The Edge revealed an innovative new listener-driven chart from iHeartRadio.

It is at the eastern end of the Catskill Park, and is one of several in the region created to provide the City of New York with water. It is the city's deepest reservoir, deep near the dam at the former site of Bishop Falls. History Olivebridge Dam under construction to build the Ashokan Reservoir circa 1910 New York City turned to the Catskills for water in the early 20th century after discovering that a group of speculators calling itself the Ramapo Water Company had bought up riparian rights to many water sources further south in Rockland, Orange and Ulster counties. The Catskills were more desirable, as state-owned Forest Preserve land in the region could not, under the state constitution, be sold to any other party. A recent amendment to that section of the state constitution also allowed up to 3% of the total Forest Preserve land to be flooded for reservoirs. In 1905 the New York State Legislature enacted legislation that created the New York City Board of Water Supply and allowed the city to acquire lands and build dams, reservoirs and aqueducts in the Catskills. Local opponents of the reservoir cast doubt on its soundness, saying it could never hold enough water (it would be one of the largest reservoirs in the world at the time),Loftin, A.J. \\"The Ashokan Reservoir\\", Hudson Valley Magazine, July 17, 2008 but when it was filled from 1912 to 1914, they were silenced. Residents of the area to be flooded did not take kindly to the idea, and fought eminent domain proceedings bitterly. They were aided by local lawyers familiar with the checkered history of Catskill land claims. It would be 1940 before the last were settled. The Ashokan Reservoir was constructed between 1907 and 1915, by the New York City Board of Water Supply, by impounding the Esopus Creek. Thousands of acres of farmland were submerged. The impoundment covered twelve communities located in a valley where farming, logging, and quarrying prevailed. Approximately two thousand residents along with roads, homes, shops, farms, churches, and mills were either moved or abandoned, but most of them were torn down. According to Bob Steuding, a humanities professor at Ulster County Community College in Stone Ridge, the area that became the West Basin of the reservoir contained 504 dwellings, nine blacksmith shops, 35 stores, 10 churches, 10 schools, seven sawmills and a gristmill. Several of these communities were re- established in nearby locations. Nearly 12-and-a-half miles (20 km) of a local railroad line (the Ulster and Delaware Railroad) was moved and cemeteries were relocated. The dam was constructed mainly by local laborers, as well as African-Americans and Italian immigrants, who also did the job of razing most of the trees and buildings in the area. Fights would often break out in the labor camps where the crews would eat and sleep, so a police force, which would later become the New York City Department of Environmental Protection (NYCDEP) Police, was established to keep peace in the camps. The dam was constructed with Rosendale cement, which at the time was the world's strongest cement. When the dam was completed, giant steam whistles blew for one hour, signaling to people in the valley to evacuate immediately. Some relocated communities survive along the reservoir's banks, such as West Shokan, Olivebridge, Ashokan and Shokan. Most, however, such as Brown's Station, are remembered in historical markers along routes 28 and 28A. The reservoir seen from the summit of alt=A view from a rocky mountain ledge over a lower mountain to a distant, winding lake Statistics The resulting body of water is the oldest New York City–owned reservoir in the Catskill Mountains, being placed into service as long ago as 1915. It is located at the eastern end of Ulster County, being about west of Kingston, New York, and approximately north of New York City. The reservoir is one of NYC's largest according to its surface area and volume. At full capacity, the reservoir can hold of water, has a 255-square-mile (408 km2) drainage basin, and is over 180 feet (54.9 m) deep at its deepest point, making it the city's deepest reservoir. Bridge at dividing line between basins The reservoir is encircled by Routes 28 and 28A, along with many relocated villages. It is separated into two basins by Reservoir Rd., which has a causeway that runs over the middle of it. Water does not pass freely between the two basins, and the eastern basin, which borders the relocated villages of Ashokan, Glenford, and West Hurley, along with the non-relocated village of Stony Hollow, is seven inches lower than the western basin. The western basin borders the relocated villages of Boiceville, Brodhead, Olive, Olivebridge, Shokan, and West Shokan. There is also an abandoned road that runs along the spillway of the reservoir, where water runs back into the Esopus Creek by Olivebridge. Some of this water comes from the Schoharie Reservoir via the 16 mile (25.6 kilometre) Shandaken Tunnel, which empties into the Esopus Creek. It also gets water from said creek and its many tributaries. It flows another to the Ashokan Reservoir. The water then flows into Olivebridge, New York to enter the Catskill Aqueduct. It flows into the Kensico Reservoir, just north of White Plains, to mix with water from the Delaware Aqueduct. The water flows a few more miles into the Hillview Reservoir in Yonkers, the main collecting point for the water. Permitted activities Due to the need to ensure the safety of the water system, and to make sure the nearly century-old dams stay intact, only limited activities are permitted around the reservoir property, including fishing and logging. One needs a special license to do such activities. For instance, if one is to go boating or fishing, which the reservoir is well known to the locals for, one would need a public access permit that was issued after 2002. Otherwise, it is no longer valid. Sunset over Ashokan High Point, a nearby mountain which provides a scenic backdrop to the reservoir Also, such activities as swimming and diving are strictly prohibited. This is in order to make sure the water stays as clean as possible. It is also illegal to bring gasoline-powered motorcraft into the reservoir. This is in case gasoline leaks into the water and pollutes it. Pine and spruce trees were planted around the banks at the time of dam and lake construction to prevent erosion. It was also believed by engineers of the time that broad-leaved deciduous trees polluted the water with nutrients more so than conifers. The south end of the closed spillway road After the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the city and state decided to permanently close the spillway road to vehicular traffic as a security precaution. This has added a great deal more traveling time and distance for those on the south side of the reservoir to reach locations to the north. The city compensates the local school district for the extra fuel costs its buses have incurred. The Reservoir Road causeway, however, is still open.

Sponsored by Cadbury India, it is one of India's most famous quiz contests. Originally held live in cities across the country, it later became a radio show and then, in June 1992, a television show on Zee TV. Later, the show was shifted to another television channel, Sony Entertainment Television. After a hiatus, it moved in a truncated version to Pogo, before landing its last TV outing in the channel Colors. In 2015, BQC completed its first YouTube-only season with Centre Point Nagpur as All India Champions. It then moved to its app called BQC where the viewers can play along. The show is hosted by Derek O'Brien. The original quiz master on the radio show was Hamid Sayani, a prominent Indian broadcast personality.Kamla Bhat, podcast, In Conversation with Ameen Sayani . Retrieved 14 May 2011. After the first four years, Hamid died and the show was taken over by his brother Ameen Sayani.C. Sarkar, \\"Vidura\\", Press Institute of India, 1977.

The children who take part must be able to present themselves clearly in Hindi or English. Also, participants should be able to balance their academics with their extracurricular activities. Each team consists of students from a given school. All the participants who reach the national finals (after making it to top 16 of 100 City Winners) are given cash prize each along with a gift hamper from Cadbury. History BQC achieved its peak popularity during the 90s in the Zee TV era, and arguably also when it moved to Sony in a similar format. During this period, BQC was considered a gold standard quiz show, where school pride was at stake and the quizzing was dead serious. The show was also frequented by A List celebrities of that era, including legends like Zakir Hussain, Lata Mangeshkar, Sachin Tendulkar among many others. However, after being pulled off air, they tried pandering to a younger audience with Pogo in the later 2000s, which was a critical failure, and went off air within one season. A couple of years later, BQC returned on Colors, this time with a female co-host. This version of the show was also populist but neither did it bring in the ratings expected. =Youtube version= After being cancelled from its fourth channel, BQC returned, but this time on YouTube, where it encourages the audience to play along using its app, or an application built into the YouTube video. The latest avatar of BQC is a mini 12-15 minute version with emphasis on objective type questions, and none of the innovative quizzing patterns established in the 90s. It saw 2 teams going head to head answering 8 questions, each with an equal number of points.

It is the only member of the genus Ectophylla. The genus and the species were both scientifically described for the first time in 1892. It has distinctive, entirely white fur, which is only found in six of the roughly 1,300 known species of bat. It constructs \\"tents\\" out of understory plant leaves by strategically cutting the leaf ribs with its teeth; it roosts in these tents during the day. It is a specialist frugivore, consuming almost exclusively the fruits of one species of fig. Females can likely become pregnant twice per year, giving birth to one offspring at a time. It is found in Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and western Panama at elevations from sea level to . Due to habitat loss, it is evaluated as near-threatened by the IUCN. Its bright yellow ears, nose-leaf, and lips are a result of carotenoid deposition; the mechanism of this deposition is being researched as a way to understand and combat macular degeneration in humans. Taxonomy and phylogeny The Honduran white bat was described as a new species, Ectophylla alba, in 1892 by American zoologist Harrison Allen. The holotype that Allen used to describe the new genus and species was collected by Charles Haskins Townsend near the Coco River in Honduras in 1887. It belongs to the leaf-nosed bat family, Phyllostomidae. Within Phyllostomidae, it is in the subfamily Stenodermatinae. MacConnell's bat was once included in the genus Ectophylla, but it is now monotypic within Mesophylla. Despite no longer being classified in the same genus, MacConnell's bat and the Honduran white bat are sister taxa—they are each other's closest relative. The Honduran white bat is the only member of Ectophylla, meaning it is a monotypic genus. The genus name \\"Ectophylla\\" is from Ancient Greek \\"ektós\\" meaning \\"out\\" and \\"phúllon\\" meaning \\"leaf,\\" referring to its nose-leaf. Its species name \\"alba\\" comes from Latin \\"albus\\" meaning \\"white.\\" Description Individual captured via mist net (Costa Rica) Like both its common name and specific epithet suggest, the Honduran white bat has bright white fur. The tips of individual hairs are gray, with the grayish coloration more pronounced towards the bat's posterior. This species, along with four Diclidurus species and the ghost bat (Macroderma gigas), is among the only currently known species of bat—more than 1,300 species have been described—where the pelage is all white. Its large nose-leaf easily distinguishes it from the northern ghost bat (Diclidurus albus), however, which is the only white bat with which it is sympatric (having an overlapping geographic range). Its wing membranes are black. Its ears, tragi (the cartilaginous projections in front of the ear openings), nose-leaf, and lips are a bright, yellowish orange. Its yellow-orange pigmentation is due to large concentrations of carotenoids, particularly xanthophyll. It is the first mammal known to have enough carotenoids in its skin to generate conspicuous color. A 2019 study found that while the brightness of the yellow pigment of the ears did not vary significantly between adults and juveniles, the yellow chroma (colorfulness relative to brightness) of the ears did differ with age. Adult bats had higher yellow chroma in their ears than did juveniles. The yellow of the nose-leaf, however, had more variation. Adult males' nose-leaves are a brighter yellow than those of adult females; juveniles of each sex did not differ in nose-leaf brightness. Adult males also had significantly brighter nose-leaves than juvenile males. Similarly to the ears, the yellow chroma of the nose-leaf was greater in adults than in juveniles, though not different between the sexes. The authors suggested that the color difference of male and female nose-leaves is indicative of sexual dichromatism, meaning that females may select for males with brighter nose-leaves. This conclusion was supported by the trend that males with brighter yellow nose-leaves tended to have better body conditions. Females could thus use nose-leaf color as a metric of male fitness when selecting a mate. Another 2019 study found that the distinctive yellow pigment may have evolved as a result of the bat's tent- roosting. Reconstructions of ancestral states showed that the yellow coloration coevolved with tent-roosting. It is a small species, with a head and body length of , a forearm length of , and an ear length of . Individuals weigh only . The bat's nose-leaf is erect, its tail is absent, and its ears large and rounded. The inner margin of the tragus is convex, while the outer margin is coarsely serrated with four or five small lobes. The nose-leaf also has a serrated margin. It has eight to ten small \\"warts\\" under its mouth. Its dental formula is , for a total of 28 teeth. Its skull is similar in appearance to other species in its subfamily, with the exception of its very deep basioccipital pits. The bat overall resembles a small, white Platyrrhinus. Biology and ecology =Tent-making= Heliconia latispatha, which is a plant species used for tent roosting (Costa Rica) The Honduran white bat is one of approximately 22 known species of bats that roost within leaf \\"tents.\\" The Honduran white bat cuts the side veins extending out from the midrib of the large leaves of the Heliconia plant causing them to fold down to form a tent. Tents are likely constructed by multiple individuals; females have been observed constructing tents, but it is likely that males do so as well. New tents are constructed throughout the year, as modifying the leaves into tents causes the leaves to die. Once modified into a tent, a leaf lives approximately 7.5 weeks, compared to 61 weeks in an unmodified leaf. Several species of Heliconia are used as roosts, including H. imbricata, H. latispatha, H. pogonantha, H. tortuosa, and H. sarapiquensis. Rarely, it has been documented using Calathea and Ischnosiphon inflatus plants as roosts. In selecting leaves to turn into tents, it appears that the age and size of the leaf is more important than the species of plant. Preferred leaves are long and less than 30 days old. Younger leaves may be preferred because they are easier to bite through and shape than older leaves. It also prefers leaves that are less than above the forest floor. Preferred leaves are in areas of low understory vegetation density, but high canopy vegetation density. Heliconia density is lower surrounding chosen leaves than would be expected if the bats selected leaves randomly. Features such as canopy density may help the tent maintain a consistent microclimate. Tents are usually , with little fluctuation. High canopy density could also protect its tent from disturbance from wind and rain. Because tent construction takes up to several weeks' worth of time from several individuals, choosing more sheltered tents could prolong the life of a tent and protect the bats' investment. Low understory vegetation density is thought to be beneficial by providing an uncluttered airspace for the bats as they exit and enter their tents. It clings to the roof of its tent in small colonies of 1-15 individuals. The tent protects it from rain and predators. Rather than roosting in a single tent consistently, the Honduran white bat has a network of tents scattered across the forest; it alternates among these tents for roosting. Single tents have been consistently occupied for up to 45 days. Although their tents are typically low to the ground, sunlight filters through the leaf which gives their white fur a greenish cast. This almost completely conceals them if they remain still. Alternately, it has been proposed that its white fur gives it the appearance of a wasp nest, which would be avoided by predators. It likely has several predators, including capuchin monkeys, Central American squirrel monkeys, and snakes. =Diet and foraging= The Honduran white bat is frugivorous. Along with the little white-shouldered bat, the Honduran white bat is one of the two smallest species of frugivorous bat in the world. It specializes on a species of fig, Ficus colubrinae. However, other species of figs are occasionally consumed, such as Ficus schippii. The Honduran white bat prefers F. colubrinae trees that are \\"high-quality,\\" or produce many fruits at once. It also chooses fig trees that are the closest to its day roosts. F. colubrinae trees have asynchronous fruit production, so its fruits are available as a food source year-round. Because it is highly specialized on the one species of fig, it has larger foraging movements than observed in frugivorous bats that are less specialized. Individuals have an average home range of . It is unclear how it manages to survive on such a narrow diet, as it is predicted it should have to consume supplemental food sources. =Reproduction= Little is known about the Honduran white bat's reproductive behaviors. It has been proposed that individuals give birth in April and September, and that estrus occurs post- parturition. Pregnant females have been documented in February, March, June, July, and August in Costa Rica, with lactating females documented in March and April. Females have synchronized births, with all births in a colony occurring within the same week. Litter size is one offspring, called a pup. During lactation, mothers will return to their roosts up to six times a night to feed their pups. Pups fledge, or become capable of flight, at 3–4 weeks old. Range and habitat Tortuguero National Park, a location where this species is found (Costa Rica) The Honduran white bat is found in several countries in Central America, including Costa Rica, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama. Unusually, it is one of four species of leaf-nosed bat endemic to Central America; most are found in South America. Its range encompasses a range of elevations from above sea level. It prefers wet evergreen forests and secondary forests, which can accommodate its specific roosting and dietary requirements. Conservation Despite being a conspicuously colored bat, over sixty years passed between the discovery of the first Honduran white bat in 1898 and the next discovery in 1963. It is currently evaluated as near- threatened by the IUCN. It meets the criteria for this designation because its population is in a \\"significant decline.\\" The decline does not exceed 30% population loss over the past three generations (approximately 18 years in this species), which would qualify it for vulnerable designation. However, it is on the verge of qualifying for the vulnerable designation. Reasons for its population decline include conversion of its habitat to farmland as well as an expanding human population. It is particularly susceptible to habitat loss because it is highly specialized on a single species of fig for its food source. Human health applications In 2016, it was discovered that the Hondoran white bat uses carotenoids to produce the yellow-orange coloration of its ears, nose-leaf, and lips. It was the first mammalian species to be documented with high enough concentrations of carotenoids to produce visible skin coloration. It isolates the pigments from its diet, particularly the fruits of the Ficus colubrinae tree. Lutein, the carotenoid responsible for its yellow pigmentation, is present in its skin in its esterified form, while in its free form in the liver. This suggests that Honduran white bats possess a physiological mechanism to convert free lutein to esterified lutein, which humans are unable to do. Lutein plays an important role in the eyes by preventing damage to the retina; it is hypothesized that if the free lutein in human eyes was esterified, it would be more effective at preventing damage and preserving vision. Understanding the process by which Honduran white bats convert free lutein to esterified lutein could assist in the understanding of how the stability and bioavailability of carotenoids benefit human health. In particular, the species may have research applications for understanding and treating macular degeneration in humans.

Production The main ingredient is beef, taken from the animal’s upper thigh or shoulder, the fat and the sinews being removed. Before drying, the meat is treated with white wine and seasonings such as salt, onion and assorted herbs. The initial curing process, lasting 3 – 5 weeks, takes place in sealed containers stored at a temperature close to freezing point. The meat is regularly rearranged during this stage, in order to ensure that the salt and seasonings will be evenly distributed and absorbed. During a second drying phase the meat is then hung in free-flowing air at a temperature of between 9 and 14 °C. It is also periodically pressed in order to separate out residual moisture: from this pressing Bündnerfleisch acquires its characteristic rectangular shape. Traditionally Bündnerfleisch was not a smoked meat. The extent of water loss during the salting and drying processes, whereby the product loses approximately half of its initial weight, is sufficient to confer excellent keeping qualities and a high nutritional value, without the need for any additional preservatives. Consumption Bündnerfleisch is served with bread, sliced very thinly. It is often part of the traditional dish raclette, served to accompany the cheese of the same name alongside ham and vegetables. It can also be served in soup, cut into strips or little cubes. Commercialisation Most Bündnerfleisch is consumed inside Switzerland, but some is exported within Europe, to Canada and the United States and to Japan. Variants Bündnerfleisch appears to be related to the dried meat product from the Besançon region of France known as 'brési'. It is also very similar to bresaola, which is produced in the neighbouring Italian province of Valtellina; unlike Bündnerfleisch, bresaola is not pressed, though.

Macau was under Portuguese rule until 1999. During the final period of colonial administration prior to the handover to China, Portugal retained only limited numbers of military personnel in Macau for liasion and support purposes; the last major units having been withdrawn following the Carnation Revolution of 1974. The Macao Garrison of the People's Liberation Army was established in 1999.

During much of the colonial period, the Portuguese garrison of Macau comprised a mixture of units from Portugal itself, African troops from Mozambique and locally recruited indigenous soldiers. Between 1784 and 1810 sepoys from Portuguese India were used to augment the regular troops. The colonial troops, whether Chinese, Indian or African, had Portuguese officers and some NCOs. In accordance with general Portuguese colonial practice they served in units designated as Caçadores (Light Infantry). Prior to 1914 a pale blue-grey zouave style uniform was worn by the Mozambique askaris with red fezzes and sashes for parade. The Macau units wore indigenous pattern dress of the same colour with conical headdresses. =1936–40= In 1936 the garrison consisted of 497 men - 22 officers, 35 NCO's and 440 soldiers; including 224 native Caçadores. The total was increased to 797 men by 1940. They were organised as follows- * 1 European infantry company * 1 European artillery company * 1 heavy machine-gun company * 2 native companies * 1 depot section pp 114-115 Garrett, Richard J.

Five indigenous companies (Companhia Indígena de Caçadores) were posted at Colane, Flora, Ilha Verde, Mong Ha and Portas do Cerco. An anti-tank company (Companhia de Anti- Carro) was posted at Ramal dos Mouros. =Final colonial period= The last of the Mozambican Caçadores were withdrawn from Macau in 1964, after the outbreak of the Portuguese Colonial War in Portugal's African possessions. The remaining Portuguese garrison in the colony effectively ceased to exist following the change of government in Portugal in 1974 and agreement on a timetable for a takeover by mainland China by 1999. For the remaining quarter- century of Portuguese administration, order was kept in the territory by a civilian police force without direct military backing.

He was tried, convicted, and executed in the electric chair in Louisiana for the murder of Tumekica Jackson. He was the last inmate to die in Louisiana's infamous electric chair, \\"Gruesome Gertie\\".  Overview  Louisiana State Penitentiary, where Jones was confined and executed On February 17, 1984, eleven-year-old Tumekica Jackson was living with her mother and her grandparents in the Scotlandville area of Baton Rouge. At 4:00 a.m., the grandmother discovered that Tumekica was missing from her bedroom. The police discovered that someone had broken the screen of the rear den window and had opened the back door. In the muddy ground near the house, police obtained a cast of an imprint made by the left shoe from a pair of size 8⅓ tennis shoes. There were no signs of a struggle inside the house. The investigation immediately focused on Jones because his stormy romantic relationship of several years with Tumekica's mother had been broken off by her the week before. Tumekica knew Jones well, and he had been in the home many times. On the evening of Tumekica's disappearance, Jones had called the mother's home three times and had told the grandmother that he would not be responsible for his actions if the mother continued to refuse to see him. About 6:30 a.m., the police went to the apartment where Jones lived with his sister, Terry Jones, and his half-brother, Abraham Mingo. Jones told the police he had been home all night, and both his sister and half-brother confirmed his story. A few hours later, Terry Jones called the police and said she may have been \\"mistaken\\" about Jones being home all night. After questioning her further, the police obtained a written consent to search the apartment about 10:00 a.m. When no one answered the officer's knock, Terry Jones used her key to open the door. Officers found Jones in the bathroom washing a pair of size 8⅓ tennis shoes. The bath tub was full of dirt and leaves. The officers seized the tennis shoes and a pair of green gloves, and they requested that Jones give them a statement at the station. After signing a waiver, Jones gave the police a tape-recorded statement in which he denied any knowledge of the offense. He was then allowed to leave with his sister. At approximately 6:00 p.m., the victim's partially nude body was found in a drainage canal. An autopsy established that the child had been beaten, raped, and manually strangled. The police again questioned Mingo. Although he initially told conflicting stories, he eventually gave a detailed account of his activities with Andrew Jones on Friday night and Saturday morning. According to Mingo, the three of them were together on Friday evening, but they had dropped Jones off in Scotlandville. About 12:30 a.m. on Saturday morning, Jones returned to the apartment. Donald Nixon was with Jones, but he stayed only a short time. Around 1:00 a.m., Mingo and Jones went to the Snowflake Lounge, but Jones left alone about 30 minutes later, and Mingo returned to the apartment. At some point between 4:30 and 5:00 a.m., Mingo was awakened by Jones's knock on the door, let Jones in, and went back to bed. When Mingo and Jones were alone in the apartment later that morning, Jones told him that \\"he shoulda stayed home\\", that \\"he did something he didn't want to do\\", and that he \\"done fucked up\\". Jones gave Mingo a TG&Y; bag and asked him to throw it away, which he did without looking inside. At Mingo's direction, police recovered a TG&Y; bag from a dumpster near a grocery store. The bag contained socks, a pair of blue jeans, and a pink sweatshirt, which were wet, muddy, and stained. Later analysis identified the stains as a mixture of blood and seminal fluid. Mingo also told the police about a pair of boxer shorts that he had found in the bathroom of the apartment. The shorts belonged to Mingo, but Jones had worn them on Friday night. With Mingo's written consent, the police recovered a pair of stained brown and white boxer shorts from the trunk of Mingo's car. Analysis confirmed the presence of blood and seminal fluid on the boxer shorts. On the basis of this information, police obtained a warrant and arrested Jones on Sunday. After advise and waiver of his rights, Jones gave a video-taped statement in which he asserted that he and Rudolph Springer had gone to the victim's house early Saturday morning to commit a burglary. Fearful of being recognized, Jones remained in the car while Springer entered the house. When Springer returned carrying Tumekica, Jones got in the back seat and pulled his cap over his face. After a few minutes, Springer drove Jones to his apartment at his request. That was the last time that Jones saw the victim.  Trial  At trial, Mingo, Terry Jones, and Springer testified for the state. Having been granted immunity, Mingo testified about Jones's statements and his request to dispose of the TG&Y; bag. Springer denied any knowledge of the crime, and he and two corroborating witnesses established his alibi for the pertinent times. Another witness, Reginald Jackson, testified that on the night of the murder, Jones asked him for a ride to Scotlandville to look for Tumekica's mother. He identified the tennis shoes, blue jeans and pink sweatshirt as the clothes worn by Jones that night. The state also introduced the tennis shoes seized from Jones's apartment. A forensic scientist testified that these were the same size and tread design as the one which left the impression at the house where Tumekica lived, but he could not make a positive identification because of the poor quality of the soil and the resultant poor quality of the cast. But he also said that there were no dissimilarities. A serologist established that the blood on Tumekica's underwear and pajama bottoms, as well as that on defendant's boxer shorts and the blue jeans, came from the victim. The seminal fluid found on these articles of clothing came from an individual with type-O blood, the same type as Jones's. Jones did not take the stand, and the defense presented no evidence. The jury unanimously found Jones guilty as charged of first degree murder. In the sentencing hearing, the state reintroduced all evidence adduced at trial. The defense presented the testimony of Jones's mother, four of his sisters, and a cousin. The jury, finding two statutory aggravating circumstances, unanimously recommended the sentence of death. Execution On July 22, 1991, Andrew Lee Jones was executed in the electric chair at Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola. He was the last person executed by electric chair in this state. A law making lethal injection the only method of execution had already been passed, but it didn't take effect until September 15. While he did not make a final statement, at a Pardon Board hearing three days before he was executed, he said: : \\"There's a possible chance I did it, a possible chance I didn't do it. If I had not been drunk, nothing like that would have happened. I'm like anybody else. . . I don't want to die or anything like that.\\"  See also  * Capital punishment in Louisiana * Capital punishment in the United States * List of people executed in Louisiana Sources * State v.

The acquisition of Archipelago, which held possession of highly regarded market technology at the time, was intended to bring automated trading to NYSE markets (which had previously utilized an \\"open outcry\\" system) and increase efficiency.

The shares of both companies were temporarily frozen on the news due to the risk of large price movements and clarifications of the deal. A successful deal would see the new company becoming the world's largest stock exchange operator with a market capitalization of listed companies equal to $15 trillion. The proposed group would have dual headquarters, in Deutsche Boerse's newly built green tower near Frankfurt, Germany, and in New York City at 11 Wall Street. It would be led by a board with seventeen members, fifteen directors plus the Chairman and the CEO. Of the fifteen directors, nine to be designated by Deutsche Boerse and six by NYSE Euronext. Current NYSE Euronext CEO Duncan Niederauer would assume the same role with the newly founded company and would lead an Executive Committee with an equal number of current Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext executives. On July 7, 2011, NYSE Euronext shareholders voted in favor of the merger, and on July 13, 2011, Deutsche Boerse shareholders approved the deal as well. These decisions move the two sides closer to completing the transaction, which must still pass through forty separate regulatory approval processes to be finalized. The merger was subject to review in both the United States and with the European Union (EU) for concerns it could create a \\"de facto monopoly\\". In October 2011, CEO Niederauer said the company had received the EU's so-called statement of objections, which was more than 100 pages long, and would be responding within two weeks, possibly by asking for the opportunity for an oral hearing with the regulators. The EU examination of the proposal formally began June 29 has said its expanded probe has a Dec. 13 deadline. In March, Joaquín Almunia, the EU's antitrust commissioner, expressed concern that the deal would maybe monopolize the derivatives market due to Deutsche Boerse's “vertical silo” which routes all trade clearing through its own services. Almunia said then he preferred a “more open business model” for markets.Rummer, Andrew, and Peter Chapman, editors, \\"NYSE Euronext May Seek EU Hearing to Defend Deutsche Boerse Deal\\", Bloomberg, October 13, 2011 11:06 am EDT.

Under the terms shareholders of NYSE would receive either $33.12 in cash for each share or .2581 IntercontinentalExchange Inc. shares, or a combination of $11.27 in cash per share plus .1703 shares of stock. The acquisition is subject to regulator approval, though since the operations of ICE and NYSE have little in common—ICE is largely devoted to trading commodities, as opposed to NYSE's business of trading stocks and securities—the deal is not expected to be blocked. ICE said that after the deal closed it would sell the Euronext portion of the company, including stock exchanges in Amsterdam, Brussels, Lisbon and Paris. The deal went through and Euronext is a sister division to NYSE and part of ICE. ICE CEO Jeffrey C. Sprecher would continue in that position at the combined company, while NYSE CEO Duncan Niederauer would serve as president. The future of the New York Stock Exchange's historic trading floor under ICE has not been announced. ICE closed the high profile and historic trading floors of its other earlier acquisitions, the International Petroleum Exchange and the New York Board of Trade in New York.

NYSE Amex NYSE Euronext completed its acquisition of the Amex (American Stock Exchange) on October 1, 2008. The transaction extended NYSE Euronext's leadership in U.S. option, cash equities, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), making it the third largest U.S. equity options marketplace based on number of contracts traded. Since the merger, Amex has been integrated into the company, with former Amex listings now trading directly on the NYSE, and has begun trading certain Nasdaq-listed securities. NYSE Arca is the first electronic market to offer listed ETP issuers a Lead Market Maker program, which encourages liquidity provision that contributes to the best prices and depth in the ETP marketplace. It is registered as a national securities exchange under the Exchange Act. NYSE Alternext NYSE Alternext was created by NYSE Euronext to meet the needs of small and mid-sized companies seeking simplified access to the stock market. Its streamlined listing requirements and trading rules are suited to the size and business needs of such firms. The rules also ensure investor transparency.

The Free Markets serve companies that are too young or too small to be listed on one of the regulated compartments of NYSE Euronext. NYSE Regulation and FINRA On May 4, 2010, NYSE Euronext and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) announced that FINRA would assume responsibility for performing the market surveillance and enforcement functions originally conducted by NYSE Regulation. The agreement was subject to review by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and was completed in June 2010. Under the announced agreement, FINRA assumed regulatory functions for NYSE Euronext's U.S. equities and options markets – the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Arca, and NYSE Amex. NYSE Euronext, through its subsidiary NYSE Regulation, remains ultimately responsible for overseeing FINRA's performance of regulatory services for the NYSE markets. =Libor administration= In early 2014, NYSE Euronext took over the administration of the London interbank offered rate from the British Bankers Association.

Opening and closing ceremonies The opening and closing bell ceremonies hosted by the NYSE date back to 1903, taking place Monday through Friday at 9:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. respectively in New York City. The opportunity to ring the bell at the New York Stock Exchange has long been considered an honor. Representatives from listed companies, especially newly listed companies and IPOs, celebrities, politicians, and other dignitaries have become fixtures at the bell podium. Bell ceremonies are seen by millions, and are the most widely watched TV events each day. The bell tradition has been extended to the branches in Paris, Brussels, and Lisbon. In Amsterdam, the opening bell was replaced by a gong, which is sounded the signal the beginning and end of the trading day. In the European offices, the opening and closing ceremonies take place at 9:00 a.m. and 5:30 p.m., respectively.

He is known for successfully resisting a Spanish attack on the colony in 1609. The maroons continued their raids on Spanish settlements. Finally in 1618, Yanga achieved an agreement with the colonial government for self-rule of the maroon settlement. It was later called San Lorenzo de los Negros, and also San Lorenzo de Cerralvo. In the late 19th century, Yanga was named as a \\"national hero of Mexico\\" and “El Primer Libertador de las Americas\\"Gaspar Yanga, el primer libertador de América - México desconocido magazine . In 1932 the settlement he formed, located in today's Veracruz province, was renamed as Yanga in his honor. Early life Yanga, aka Nyanga, was said to be of the Bran peopleCurto, José C. and Renée Soulodre-LaFrance. Africa and the Americas. Africa World Press: Trenton, New Jersey. 2005. pp. 174-177. and a member of the royal family of Gabon.Rodriguez, Junius P. ed. Encyclopedia of Slave Resistance and Rebellion. Greenwood Press: Westport, Connecticut. 2007. He was captured and sold into slavery in Mexico, where he was called Gaspar Yanga. Before the end of the slave trade, New Spain had the fifth-highest slave population (estimated 200,000) of the Americas after Brazil (over 4.9 million), the Caribbean (over 4 million), Cuba (over 1 million) and Hispaniola, where unpaid labor is still a practice in Haiti; it also developed a free black population. Around 1570, Yanga led a band of slaves in escaping to the highlands near Veracruz. They built a small maroon colony, or palenque. Its isolation helped protect it for more than 30 years, and other fugitive slaves found their way there. Because the people survived in part by raiding caravans taking goods along the Camino Real (Royal Road) between Veracruz and Mexico City, in 1609 the Spanish colonial government decided to undertake a campaign to regain control of this territory. Spanish 1609 attack Led by the soldier Pedro González de Herrera, about 550 Spanish troops set out from Puebla in January; an estimated 100 were Spanish regulars and the rest conscripts and adventurers. The maroons were an irregular force of 100 fighters having some type of firearm, and 400 more armed with stones, machetes, bows and arrows, and the like. These maroon troops were led by Francisco de la Matosa, an Angolan. Yanga—who was quite old by this time—decided to use his troops' superior knowledge of the terrain to resist the Spaniards, with the goal of causing them enough pain to draw them to the negotiating table. Upon the approach of the Spanish troops, Yanga sent terms of peace via a captured Spaniard. He asked for a treaty akin to those that had settled hostilities between Indians and Spaniards: an area of self- rule in return for tribute and promises to support the Spanish if they were attacked. In addition, Yanga said this proposed district would return any slaves who might flee to it. This last concession was necessary to soothe the worries of the many slave owners in the region. The Spaniards refused the terms and went into battle, resulting in heavy losses for both sides. The Spaniards advanced into the maroon settlement and burned it. But, the maroons fled into the surrounding terrain, which they knew well, and the Spaniards could not achieve a conclusive victory. The resulting stalemate lasted years; finally, the Spanish agreed to parley. Yanga's terms were agreed to, with the additional provisos that only Franciscan priests would tend to the people, and that Yanga's family would be granted the right of rule. In 1618 the treaty was signed. By 1630 the town of San Lorenzo de los Negros de Cerralvo was established. Located in today's Veracruz province, the town in the 21st century is known as Yanga. Legacy and honors In 1871, five decades after Mexican independence, Yanga was designated as a \\"national hero of Mexico\\" and El Primer Libertador de las Americas. This was based largely on an account by historian Vicente Riva Palacio. The influential Riva Palacio was also a novelist, short story writer, military general, and mayor of Mexico City. In the late 1860s he found in Inquisition archives accounts of Yanga and of the 1609 Spanish expedition against him, as well as the later agreement. He published an account of Yanga in an anthology in 1870, and as a separate pamphlet in 1873. Reprints have followed, including a recent edition in 1997. Much of the subsequent writing about Yanga was influenced by the works of Riva Palacio. He characterized the maroons of San Lorenzo de los Negros as proud men who would not be defeated.

He played college football for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team and professional football in the National Football League (NFL) for the Detroit Lions from 1959 to 1965 and the Cleveland Browns from 1966 to 1967. He was selected as a first-team All-American in 1958, as the NFL Rookie of the Year in 1959, and as a Pro Bowl player in 1960 and 1961. Between 1959 and 1965, he set a Lions franchise record with 3,933 rushing yards. Early years Pietrosante was born in Ansonia, Connecticut, in 1937, and attended Notre Dame High School in West Haven, Connecticut. In his senior year at Notre Dame High School, he scored 23 touchdowns in nine games, became the school's first all- state athlete in any sport, and led the 1954 football team to an undefeated season, outscoring opponents 332–12. Notre Dame Pietrosante attended the University of Notre Dame where he played football as a fullback for the Fighting Irish football team from 1956 to 1958. As a junior in 1957, he recovered a fumble, delivered a key block on Notre Dame's touchdown, and was the leading rusher in a 7–0 victory that broke Oklahoma's record 47-game winning streak. For the 1957 season, he rushed for 449 yards on 90 carries and was selected by the United Press as a third-team All-American. As a senior in 1958, he rushed for 556 yards on 117 carries and was selected by the American Football Coaches Association and Football Writers Association of America as the first-team fullback on the 1958 College Football All-America Team. Professional football Pietrosante was selected by the Detroit Lions in the first round, sixth overall pick, of the 1959 NFL Draft. As a rookie in 1959, he rushed for 134 yards against the Green Bay Packers on Thanksgiving Day, the best rushing total recorded by a Lion since Bob Hoernschemeyer rushed for 198 yards in 1950. After the game, Green Bay coach Vince Lombardi said, \\"That boy shall be a great one some day. He is very tough to bring down.\\" He also led the NFL with an average of 5.9 rushing yards per carry and won the 1959 National Football League Rookie of the Year Award. In 1960, Pietrosante had three 100-yard rushing games, including a career-high 142 yards and two touchdowns against the Dallas Cowboys. For the 1960 season, he rushed for 872 yards, a Lions single-season record and the fourth highest total in the NFL that year. He was also selected to play in the Pro Bowl and was named the most valuable player on the 1960 Lions team. In 1961, Pietrosante rushed for 841 yards, again the fourth most in the NFL, and was selected to play in the Pro Bowl for the second consecutive year. Between 1959 and 1965, Pietrosante set a Lions' franchise record with 3,933 rushing yards. In September 1966, shortly before the start of the 1966 NFL regular season, the Lions' head coach Harry Gilmer placed Pietrosante on waivers. Days later, he was signed by the Cleveland Browns, who had lost the services of Jim Brown after the 1965 season. However, Pietrosante saw limited action for the Browns, carrying the ball only 17 times for 93 yards during the 1966 and 1967 seasons. In July 1968, Pietrosante announced at age 30 that he was retiring from the NFL. Family and later years Pietrosante was married to Geraldine Marie Cox, a nurse from Connecticut, in 1957. They had two daughters, Stacy and Cindy, and one son, Nicholas Judd. After retiring from the NFL, he began a business career in the Detroit area. His business interests included an insurance agency (the Schmidt-Barr-Pietrosante Agency) operated with former teammates Joe Schmidt and Terry Barr, a manufacturers representative company (Nick Pietrosante Associates), and a partial ownership interest in the Dearborn Racquet Club. In February 1988, Pietrosante died of prostate cancer at Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Michigan, at age 50.

The common names of many species and genera reference military ranks or – namely the Adoliadini – titles of nobility (e.g., count, duke, earl, and marquis), in reference to these butterflies' large size, bold patterns, and dashing flight. In particular, the light stripe running lengthwise across the wings of many Limenitidini has reminded earlier authors of officers' (e.g. admiral, commander, commodore) shoulder marks and epaulets. In flight, many of these butterflies have the habit of flapping their wings, so the (usually) bright upperside and the cryptic underside alternate for the observer, then gliding for prolonged distances, with the motionless wings held outstretched. The common names of some Limenitidinae – \\"aeroplanes\\", \\"clippers\\", or \\"gliders\\" – refer to this flight pattern. Systematics The Biblidinae are sometimes merged here. The present subfamily is also sometimes included as a tribe Limenitidini in the Nymphalinae. But in fact, their closest living relatives seem to be the Heliconiinae.Wahlberg & Brower (2007a,b) The Limenitidinae are traditionally divided into four tribes, of which the Parthenini are the most basal lineage and the others form a close-knit and more apomorphic radiation. While this basic layout is likely to be fairly correct, a few genera cannot be easily assigned to the three \\"modern\\" tribes and seem to be somewhat intermediate. In particular, the delimitation of the Limenitidini versus the Neptini is in need of more study.Wahlberg & Brower (2007a), and see references in Savela (2008) =Genera and selected species= The genera of Limenitidinae, sorted per tribe in the presumed phylogenetic sequence and with some species also listed, are: Tribe Parthenini Reuter, 1896 * Bhagadatta Moore, [1898] * Parthenos – clippers Tribe Adoliadini Doubleday, 1845 * Abrota Moore, 1857 * Bassarona Moore, [1897] – marquises, dukes ** Bassarona durga – blue duke ** Bassarona iva – grand duke ** Bassarona recta – redtail marquis ** Bassarona teuta – banded marquis * Dophla Moore, [1880] – dukes ** Dophla evelina – redspot duke * Euthalia – barons, dukes * Euthaliopsis Neervoort van de Poll, 1896 * Lexias – archdukes * Neurosigma Butler, 1868 * Tanaecia Butler, [1869] – counts ** Tanaecia cocytus – lavender count ** Tanaecia julii – common earl ** Tanaecia lepidea – grey count ** Tanaecia pelea – Malay viscount * Aterica Boisduval, 1833 – forest-glade nymphs * Bebearia Hemming, 1960 * Catuna Kirby, 1871 – pathfinders * Crenidomimas Karsch, 1894 * Cynandra Schatz, [1887] – brilliant nymph * Euphaedra Hübner, [1819] – typical foresters, figeaters * Euptera Staudinger, [1891] * Euriphene Boisduval, 1847 * Euryphaedra Staudinger, [1891] * Euryphura Staudinger, [1891] * Euryphurana Hecq, 1992 – noble commander * Hamanumida Hübner, [1819] – guineafowl * Harmilla Aurivillius, 1892 – elegant forester * Pseudargynnis Karsch, 1892 – false fritillary * Pseudathyma Staudinger, [1891] – false sergeants Tribe Limenitidini Behr, 1864 * Adelpha Hübner, [1819] – sisters (sometimes included in Limenitis) ** Adelpha basiloides ** Adelpha bredowii – Mexico sister ** Adelpha californica – California sister (formerly in A. bredowii) ** Adelpha eulalia – Arizona sister (formerly in A. bredowii) ** Adelpha fessonia – band-celled sister * Auzakia Moore, [1898] ** Auzakia danava – commodore * Lelecella Hemming, 1939 * Limenitis – admirals * Litinga Moore, [1898] * Parasarpa Moore, [1898] ** Parasarpa dudu – white commodore ** Parasarpa zayla – bicolor commodore * Patsuia Moore, [1898] * Sumalia Moore, [1898] ** Sumalia daraxa – green commodore ** Sumalia zulema – scarce white commodore * Moduza Moore, [1881] – commanders (sometimes included in Limenitis) ** Moduza procris – commander * Tarattia Moore, [1898] * Athyma – sergeants * Pandita Moore, 1857 * Tacola Moore, [1898] Neptis pryeri pryeri (Neptini) Tribe Neptini Newman, 1870 * Aldania Moore, [1896] * Lasippa Moore, [1898] * Neptis – typical sailers * Pandassana Moore, [1898] (might belong in Neptis) * Pantoporia Hübner, [1819] – lascars ** Pantoporia assamica – Assam lascar ** Pantoporia bieti – Tytler's lascar ** Pantoporia hordonia – common lascar ** Pantoporia karwara – Karwar lascar ** Pantoporia paraka – Perak lascar ** Pantoporia sandaka – extra lascar * Phaedyma Felder, 1861 – aeroplanes ** Phaedyma shepherdi – common aeroplane Pseuodoneptis coenobita is sometimes placed in the Limenitidini.

As a colleague of the urban planner Baron Haussmann, he designed much of the characteristic Parisian street furniture: benches, pavilions, bandstands, fountains, lampposts, signposts, fences and balustrades, jetties, monuments, as well as a number of landmark buildings. Among his most notable works are the popular Saint-Michel Fountain in Place Saint-Michel, the old Palais du Trocadéro (demolished 1937), and the two theatres at the Place du Châtelet (the Théâtre du Châtelet and the Théâtre de la Ville.) In 1868, Davioud succeeded Jacques Landry as mayor of Houlgate, where he stayed until 1871. His mandate was interrupted when he was appointed capitaine du génie during the Franco-Prussian War. Noted for his work in Paris, he built a single villa in Houlgate, La Brise, on the Route de Caumont.

She was finally sunk as a target in 1970. History USS Otter was named in honor of Lieutenant Bethel V. Otter (1914-1942), who was killed in action on Corregidor on 6 May 1942.. She was laid down on 26 July 1943 by the Charleston Navy Yard; launched on 23 October 1943; sponsored by Mrs. William M. Otter, the mother of Lieutenant Otter; commissioned on 21 February 1944, Lieutenant Commander D. M. Kerr, United States Naval Reserve, in command. =Battle of the Atlantic= Following a Bermuda shakedown, Otter joined the Atlantic Fleet and escorted two carriers to Casablanca, then, for the remainder of the year, she helped protect convoys shuttling from the United States to various Mediterranean ports. Throughout these operations not a single ship was lost. In December 1944, Otter and three of her sister ships formed a task group to hunt and destroy German U-boats in the middle and north Atlantic. On 16 January 1945, without assistance from aircraft, the group located and sank . Otter, after playing a crucial role in the depth charge attack, proudly displayed a submarine silhouette on her bridge. In April, this task group joined a large task force of destroyer escorts and escort carriers patrolling the shipping lanes of the North Atlantic and searching for submarines. During these operations, destroyer escort was torpedoed and sunk, and while other ships of the group engaged and sank , Otter assisted in the rescue of survivors. Upon the end of the war in Europe, Otter was one of the ships assigned to accept the surrender of German submarines. She intercepted a U-boat east of Newfoundland, put a boarding party on board, and escorted the submarine, the second to surrender, over a thousand miles to the East Coast of the United States. Otter then began to refit for the Pacific War. The end of hostilities changed plans and Otter was assigned to the Naval Submarine Base New London, Connecticut, to assist in submarine training. =Fate= By directive dated January 1947, Otter was placed out of commission, in reserve, attached to the United States Atlantic Reserve Fleet and berthed in Florida. She was finally sunk as target off Puerto Rico on 10 July 1970.  Awards  Otter received one battle star for service in World War II.

The most common WDM candidates are sterile neutrinos and gravitinos. The WIMPs (weakly interacting massive particles), when produced non-thermally could be candidates for warm dark matter. In general, however the thermally produced WIMPs are cold dark matter candidates. keVins and GeVins One possible WDM candidate particle with a mass of a few keV comes from introducing two new, zero charge, zero lepton number fermions to the Standard Model of Particle Physics: \\"keV-mass inert fermions\\" (keVins) and \\"GeV-mass inert fermions\\" (GeVins). keVins are overproduced if they reach thermal equilibrium in the early universe, but in some scenarios the entropy production from the decays of unstable heavier particles can suppresses their abundance to the correct value. These particles are considered \\"inert\\" because they only have suppressed interactions with the Z boson. Sterile neutrinos with masses of a few keV are possible candidates for keVins. At temperatures below the electroweak scale their only interactions with standard model particles are weak interactions due to their mixing with ordinary neutrinos. Due to the smallness of the mixing angle they are not overproduced because they freeze out before reaching thermal equilibrium. Their properties are consistent with astrophysical bounds coming from structure formation and the Pauli principle if their mass is larger than 1-8 keV. In February 2014, different analyses have extracted from the spectrum of X-ray emissions observed by XMM-Newton, a monochromatic signal around 3.5 keV. This signal is coming from different galaxy clusters (like Perseus and Centaurus) and several scenarios of warm dark matter can justify such a line. We can cite, for example, a 3.5 keV candidate annihilating into 2 photons, or a 7 keV dark matter particle decaying into a photon and a neutrino. In November 2019, analysis of the interaction of various galactic halo matter on densities and distribution of stellar streams, coming off the satellites of the Milky Way, they were able to constrain minimums of mass for density perturbations by warm dark matter Kevins in the GD-1 and Pal 5 streams.

Months later, Botbyl and Salcedo returned to explore and exploit the network at a store located in Southfield, Michigan. They then attempted to install a program that could have allowed them to capture the credit card information of customers conducting transactions through the Southfield store. The government claimed that the crime could have caused more than $2.5 million in damages. The three men were initially charged with 16 counts of wire fraud and unauthorized intrusion. Botbyl pleaded guilty to one count of Conspiracy, and the remaining counts were dismissed on the government's motion, per a plea bargain. Ultimately, Botbyl was sentenced to 26 months imprisonment, followed by two years of supervised release. On September 1, 2006, Botbyl was released from Federal Bureau of Prisons custody.

The measure μ is called σ-finite if X is the countable union of measurable sets with finite measure. A set in a measure space is said to have σ-finite measure if it is a countable union of measurable sets with finite measure. A measure being σ-finite is a weaker condition than being finite, i.e. all finite measures are σ-finite but there are (many) σ-finite measures that are not finite. A different but related notion that should not be confused with sigma- finiteness is s-finiteness.  Definition  Let (X, mathcal{A}) be a measurable space and mu a measure on it. The measure mu is called a σ-finite measure, if it satisfies one of the four following equivalent criteria: # the set X can be covered with at most countably many measurable sets with finite measure. This means that there are sets A_1, A_2, ldots in mathcal A with muleft(A_nright) < infty for all n in N that satisfy bigcup_{n in N} A_n = X . # the set X can be covered with at most countably many measurable disjoint sets with finite measure. This means that there are sets B_1, B_2, ldots in mathcal A with muleft(B_nright)< infty for all n in N and B_i cap B_j = varnothing for i eq j that satisfy bigcup_{n in N} B_n = X . # the set X can be covered with a monotone sequence of measurable sets with finite measure. This means that there are sets C_1, C_2, ldots in mathcal{A} with C_1 subset C_2 subset cdots and muleft(C_nright) < infty for all n in N that satisfy bigcup_{n in N} C_n = X . # there exists a strictly positive measurable function f whose integral is finite. This means that f(x) > 0 for all x in X and int f(x) mu(mathrm{d}x)<infty . If mu is a sigma-finite measure, the measure space (X, mathcal{A}, mu) is called a sigma -finite measure space. Examples =Lebesgue measure= For example, Lebesgue measure on the real numbers is not finite, but it is σ-finite. Indeed, consider the intervals for all integers ; there are countably many such intervals, each has measure 1, and their union is the entire real line. =Counting measure= Alternatively, consider the real numbers with the counting measure; the measure of any finite set is the number of elements in the set, and the measure of any infinite set is infinity. This measure is not σ-finite, because every set with finite measure contains only finitely many points, and it would take uncountably many such sets to cover the entire real line. But, the set of natural numbers mathbb N with the counting measure is σ -finite. =Locally compact groups= Locally compact groups which are σ-compact are σ-finite under the Haar measure. For example, all connected, locally compact groups G are σ-compact. To see this, let V be a relatively compact, symmetric (that is V = V−1) open neighborhood of the identity. Then : H = bigcup_{n in mathbb{N}} V^n is an open subgroup of G. Therefore H is also closed since its complement is a union of open sets and by connectivity of G, must be G itself. Thus all connected Lie groups are σ-finite under Haar measure. =Negative examples= Any non-trivial measure taking only the two values 0 and infty is clearly non σ-finite. One example in R is: for all A subset R, mu(A) = infty if and only if A is not empty; another one is: for all A subset R, mu(A) = infty if and only if A is uncountable, 0 otherwise. Incidentally, both are translation-invariant. Properties The class of σ-finite measures has some very convenient properties; σ-finiteness can be compared in this respect to separability of topological spaces. Some theorems in analysis require σ-finiteness as a hypothesis. Usually, both the Radon–Nikodym theorem and Fubini's theorem are stated under an assumption of σ-finiteness on the measures involved. However, as shown in Segal's paper \\"Equivalences of measure spaces\\" (Am. J. Math. 73, 275 (1953)) they require only a weaker condition, namely localisability. Though measures which are not σ-finite are sometimes regarded as pathological, they do in fact occur quite naturally. For instance, if X is a metric space of Hausdorff dimension r, then all lower-dimensional Hausdorff measures are non- σ-finite if considered as measures on X. = Equivalence to a probability measure = Any σ-finite measure μ on a space X is equivalent to a probability measure on X: let Vn, n ∈ N, be a covering of X by pairwise disjoint measurable sets of finite μ-measure, and let wn, n ∈ N, be a sequence of positive numbers (weights) such that :sum_{n = 1}^infty w_n = 1. The measure ν defined by : u(A) = sum_{n = 1}^infty w_n frac{muleft(A cap V_nright)}{muleft(V_nright)} is then a probability measure on X with precisely the same null sets as μ.  Related concepts  = Moderate measures = A Borel measure (in the sense of a locally finite measure on the Borel sigma-algebra) mu is called a moderate measure iff there are at most countably many open sets A_1, A_2, ldots with muleft(A_iright) < infty for all i and bigcup_{i=1}^infty A_i = X. Every moderate measure is a sigma -finite measure, the converse is not true. = Decomposable measures = A measure is called a decomposable measure there are disjoint measurable sets left(A_iright)_{i in I} with muleft(A_iright) < infty for all i in I and bigcup_{i in I} A_i = X . Note that for decomposable measures, there is no restriction on the number of measurable sets with finite measure. Every sigma -finite measure is a decomposable measure, the converse is not true. = s-finite measures = A measure mu is called a s-finite measure if it is the sum of at most countably many finite measures. Every σ-finite measure is s-finite, the converse is not true. For a proof and counterexample see s-finite measure#Relation to σ-finite measures.

Among finite measures are probability measures. The finite measures are often easier to handle than more general measures and show a variety of different properties depending on the sets they are defined on.  Definition  A measure mu on measurable space (X, mathcal A) is called a finite measure iff it satisfies : mu(X) < infty. By the monotonicity of measures, this implies : mu(A) < infty text{ for all } A in mathcal A. If mu is a finite measure, the measure space (X, mathcal A, mu) is called a finite measure space or a totally finite measure space.  Properties  = General case = For any measurable space, the finite measures form a convex cone in the Banach space of signed measures with the total variation norm. Important subsets of the finite measures are the sub-probability measures, that form a convex subset, and the probability measures, which are the intersection of the unit sphere in the normed space of signed measures and the finite measures. = Topological spaces = If X is a Hausdorff space and mathcal A contains the Borel sigma -algebra then every finite measure is also a locally finite Borel measure. = Metric spaces = If X is a metric space and the mathcal A is again the Borel sigma-algebra, the weak convergence of measures can be defined. The corresponding topology is called weak topology and is the initial topology of all bounded continuous functions on X . The weak topology corresponds to the weak* topology in functional analysis. If X is also separable, the weak convergence is metricized by the Lévy–Prokhorov metric. = Polish spaces = If X is a Polish space and mathcal A is the Borel sigma-algebra, then every finite measure is a regular measure and therefore a Radon measure. If X is Polish, then the set of all finite measures with the weak topology is Polish too.

Recorded in 1970, it is included on the second, more acoustic-oriented side of Led Zeppelin III (1970). The plaintive ballad reflects on lost love and features strummed acoustic guitar rhythm with pedal steel guitar. The Yardbirds, with guitarist Jimmy Page, recorded an early version of the song in 1968, titled \\"Knowing That I'm Losing You\\". When it was released on the Page-produced 2017 album Yardbirds '68, Keith Relf's vocal was left out. \\"Tangerine\\" has been performed in concert by Led Zeppelin at different points in their career and has been recorded by other musicians. Background \\"Tangerine\\" dates back to Page's time as lead guitarist with the Yardbirds. In April 1968, the group recorded demos for several songs at the Columbia Studios in New York City. Page biographer George Case notes that \\"Knowing That I'm Losing You\\" is very similar to \\"Tangerine\\" and suggests that Jackie DeShannon inspired the tune. Recordings from these sessions (with producer Manny Kellem) and the concert performance later used for Live Yardbirds: Featuring Jimmy Page were rejected for release at the time, but were issued in 2017 on the Yardbirds '68 compilation album produced by Page. While the demo recorded by the Yardbirds featured a vocal by Keith Relf, the 2017 release does not include it. To develop material for a follow-up album to Led Zeppelin II, Page and singer Robert Plant took a working holiday at Bron-Yr-Aur, a rustic retreat in South Snowdonia, Wales. Plant in particular was inspired by the back-to-the-land trends in northern California and the British folk scene. Accompanied only by acoustic guitar, hand-claps, and harmonica, the pair created tunes that served as the basis for several songs on Led Zeppelin III and later albums. Although written earlier, \\"Tangerine\\" reflects this rural sensibility and journalist Nigel Williamson includes it with the acoustic material born of the Bron-yr- aur sojourn. Other earlier influences include songs recorded at Mickie Most's Donovan sessions, when John Paul Jones and Page were studio musicians. Composition and recording The song begins with a guitar figure, then a pause to set the right tempo. The guitar proceeds with an A minor–G–D guitar progression. Page actually plays two guitar parts – one on a six-string and the other on a twelve-string acoustic guitar – which, due to the audio mixing, almost sound as one. Plant then sings the first verse accompanied by the backing guitar chords: Bassist John Paul Jones complements Page on mandolin. The second verse contains the chorus, at the beginning of which Jones on bass and drummer John Bonham come in – Jones follows the chord changes and Bonham plays a straightforward, backing beat. Through the use of double tracking, Plant provides a harmony vocal line. Page also adds pedal steel guitar fills; however, he departs from the typical American country music approach by adding a wah-wah pedal tonal effect. For the third verse, Plant returns to singing accompanied by guitar chording. The verses are broken up with an instrumental middle section with Page, Jones, and Bonham. Page solos on a heavily sustained Gibson Les Paul Standard electric guitar, which is also double tracked. Led Zeppelin biographer Dave Lewis calls it \\"a smooth woman-tone solo\\" After a second chorus, the song winds down with pedal steel fills and ends with an acoustic guitar figure. Led Zeppelin recorded the song at Headley Grange, Headley, East Hampshire, using the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. The song was engineered and later mixed by Andy Johns at Olympic Studios in London. Disagreement over lyrics Although writers do not question who composed the music for the song, there is some disagreement over who wrote the lyrics. In addition to being credited as the songwriter on all Led Zeppelin releases, Page claims to be responsible for the lyrics: \\"I'd written it after an old emotional upheaval and I just changed a few of the lyrics for the new version\\". \\"Tangerine\\" and \\"Dazed and Confused\\" are the only Led Zeppelin songs with lyrics that credit Page as the sole songwriter. However, Case, Shadwick, and Williamson identify the Yardbirds' song as a joint or co-composition by Page and Yardbirds' singer and primary lyricist Keith Relf. Yardbirds' drummer Jim McCarty and bassist Chris Dreja both assert that Relf wrote the words for \\"Knowing That I'm Losing You\\"; they and Jane Relf (sister and singer who also performed with Relf) believe some of his original lines found their way into \\"Tangerine\\". Release and influence \\"Tangerine\\" was issued as an album track on Led Zeppelin III on 5 October 1970 in the US and 23 October 1970 in the UK and quickly went to number one on the album charts. It was included on the LP record's second side, which featured more acoustic- and folk-influenced tunes. Williamson notes that \\"the song also points the way to the future... the acoustic guitar intro can easily be seen as an early template for 'Stairway to Heaven'\\". During Led Zeppelin's 1971–72 tours, they regularly performed the song and recordings appear on several bootleg albums.

These two measures are uniquely determined by mu and u. Refinement Lebesgue's decomposition theorem can be refined in a number of ways. First, the decomposition of the singular part of a regular Borel measure on the real line can be refined: :, u = u_{mathrm{cont}} + u_{mathrm{sing}} + u_{mathrm{pp}} where * νcont is the absolutely continuous part * νsing is the singular continuous part * νpp is the pure point part (a discrete measure). Second, absolutely continuous measures are classified by the Radon–Nikodym theorem, and discrete measures are easily understood. Hence (singular continuous measures aside), Lebesgue decomposition gives a very explicit description of measures. The Cantor measure (the probability measure on the real line whose cumulative distribution function is the Cantor function) is an example of a singular continuous measure.

He has previously been the head coach of the Maine Red Claws of the NBA Development League, the University of Virginia, and his alma mater; Northeastern University. He was named the 2006–07 Atlantic Coast Conference Coach of the Year by the Associated Press, but finished at 10th and 11th place in the conference during his final two years with the Virginia Cavaliers. He resigned as the Virginia basketball coach on March 18, 2009. Leitao is Cape Verdean American. He was the first coach of African descent to coach any varsity sport in University of Virginia history. Biography =Playing career= The 6'7\\" forward was recruited by Jim Calhoun to play basketball at Northeastern University. From 1978 to 1982 Leitao played at Northeastern, where he averaged 6.0 points and 5.4 rebounds per game. The teams made it to the NCAA tournament twice, and posted an overall 79-34 record. Leitao is a member of the Omicron chapter of Iota Phi Theta fraternity. =Early coaching career= Leitao was recruited by Calhoun to join his staff at Northeastern University in 1984, and followed him to the University of Connecticut as an assistant from 1986 to 1994. He returned to serve as head coach at his alma mater, Northeastern University, from 1994 to 1996. Leitao returned to Calhoun's staff for six seasons, including the Huskies national championship in 1999. =DePaul= In 2002, he secured the head coaching position at DePaul University after the departure of Pat Kennedy; in a three-year stint on the Chicago campus. He led DePaul in two trips to the NIT and a trip to the NCAA Tournament. =Virginia= Leitao was hired by the University of Virginia prior to the 2005-2006 basketball season. He became the first person of African descent to coach any varsity sport in Virginia Cavaliers history. Leitao was hired by Virginia's Craig Littlepage, the first African-American athletics director in ACC history. In his first year at Virginia, Leitao led the Cavaliers to a 15-15 (7-9 ACC) record and a berth in the NIT. His first season at UVA, with only seven scholarship players, Virginia was picked last in the ACC by reporters, but surprised the ACC finishing at 7-9 tied for 7th place. Getting contributions from little known front court players including Jason Cain and Tunji Soroye, Virginia was able to upset #23 North Carolina on Jan. 19. Most of the season's success was due to All-ACC first team Sean Singletary, who carried the team with JR Reynolds. This year also marked the last year at University Hall for the Cavaliers. Labeled as the \\"Last Ball At U-Hall\\", Virginia was ready to move into the new state of the art John Paul Jones Arena right next door. This marked the end of an era that Ralph Sampson built, bringing flashbacks and reunions to mark the final season at University Hall. The year finished with a disappointing loss to Maryland to close out U-Hall and a blowout loss at Stanford in the NIT. At this point, things were looking up for Leitao and the Virginia Cavaliers. With its core returning and a new group of recruits, Virginia looked to turn its fortunes around in 2006-07. Leitao started his second year with the opening of the new John Paul Jones arena and an upset win over Arizona. Led by Sean Singletary and J. R. Reynolds, Virginia finished with an 11-5 conference record and a share of the ACC regular season title with North Carolina. Memorable wins came over Duke, with Sean Singletary's fadeaway floater and stare on ESPN, while memorable losses came in Puerto Rico and last place Wake Forest. This was Leitao's best year with the Cavaliers. On March 6, 2007, Leitao was voted as the 2007 ACC Coach of the Year by the Associated Press in conjunction with the Atlantic Coast Sports Media Association. Two days later, the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) named Dave Leitao the 2007 District 5 Coach of the Year. In the NCAA Tournament, the #4 seeded Cavaliers defeated the University at Albany in the first round in an 84-57 rout. In the second round, Sean Singletary's last-second shot bounced off the rim and the Cavaliers were defeated by the University of Tennessee in a 77-74 loss. The team completed the 2006-2007 season with a record of 21-11 (11-5 ACC). Leitao's third season (2007-2008) was marked with close losses and early injuries to the team's top two frontcourt players, Tunji Soroye and Laurynas Mikalauskas; the two injured players only appeared in two games and sixteen games, respectively. The team attained a 4-3 record with Mikalauskas in the line-up versus a 1-8 record with him injured. Without these two players, the Cavaliers proceeded to lose seven games by two points or less or in overtime; the team ended the season with a record of 17-16 (5-11 ACC). However, as injured players began to return to the team, the Cavaliers won six of their final ten games, and advanced to the semifinals of the inaugural College Basketball Invitational. In Leitao's fourth year (2008-09), Virginia was the unanimous pick for last place in the ACC. In December, UVA looked as if they were going to be the surprise of the ACC with their first ACC win coming at Georgia Tech. However, Georgia Tech was the surprise finishing last with UVA coming in 11th place at 4-12 in the league. Leitao's frustrated team was led by Sylven Landesberg who averaged 16.8 points per game and captured the ACC Rookie of the Year award. Other notables: Assane Sene missed early and late parts of the season with ankle injuries while showing some promise as a young defensive stopper. Sammy Zeglinski, Leitao's first recruit, gained valuable experience at point guard after being red-shirted in 2007-08 with an ankle injury. Overall, fans were quite discouraged with the lack of improvements and player rotation. 4th year Mamadi Diane's career hit the lowest point during a 4-game stretch where he did not log a single minute. However, he did return for 23 points in his Senior Day finale and 24 points in the first round loss to BC in the ACC tournament. Leitao resigned as head coach on March 16, 2009 at the conclusion of a 10-18 season and 11th-place finish in the ACC. The 10-18 season was Virginia's worst season since the 1967-68 season, when the team posted a 9-17 record. Leitao would be paid $2.1 million in a contract buyout by the University of Virginia.http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/news/story?id=3986162 =Maine Red Claws= On July 21, 2011, Leitao was named head coach of the Maine Red Claws of the NBA Development League.Red Claws hire Dave Leitao as head coach, accessed July 22 Leitao left the Red Claws after one season to become an assistant coach at the University of Missouri under Frank Haith.Leitao joins Tigers , accessed June 17, 2012 =Return to DePaul= Following the March 2015 resignation of head coach Oliver Purnell, DePaul hired Leitao to lead the program for the second time.Dave Leitao returns as head coach at DePaul , accessed April 23, 2015 The Blue Demons won only 9 games in both the 2015–16 and 2016-17 seasons, the first two of Leitao's latest tenure at the school. In his third season, the Blue Demons improved slightly, winning 11 games. The 2018–2019 season, Leitao's fourth, saw a turnaround for DePaul as the Blue Demons finished with a 19-17 overall record. Leitao's squad won their tenth game before mid-January with a non-conference schedule ranked last in the Big East. The season also saw the Blue Demons beat a ranked opponent for the first time in several years, winning 79-71 against No. 24 St. John's, who was playing without its best player, Shamorie Ponds.With Ponds out, No. 24 St. John's loses 79-71 to DePaul, accessed January 13, 2019 Following the regular season, the Blue Demons were invited to the 2019 College Basketball Invitational tournament. The team finished as runner-up to the University of South Florida Bulls. In the Best of Three Championship series, DePaul beat South Florida in game 2, but dropped games one and three to the Bulls to give DePaul a second place finish in the tournament. In the 2019-2020 season, Leitao began the season suspended due to a recruiting violation in connection with a former player. He made his season debut at Iowa following assistant Tim Anderson coaching the Blue Demons to three straight wins. He won nine of his first ten games of the season including an upset at Iowa and an exciting overtime win against Texas Tech at home. After coaching DePaul to 9 of its 12 non-conference wins and only losing a single non-conference game, Leitao coached the team to a 3-15 conference record, enough to land the team in last place of the Big East conference for the fourth consecutive season. Leitao won a Big East Tournament game for the first time ever, beating Xavier 71-67. The remainder of the tournament would be cancelled the next day due to concerns over the coronavirus. While DePaul won 16 games this season, only 13 of those wins are attributable to Dave Leitao's head coaching record, as he was suspended for and did not coach in three of DePaul's wins. Following the season, DePaul extended Leitao's contract through the 2023-24 season.

Rescorla was a Professor Emeritus of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn). He received his B.A. in Psychology with minors in Philosophy and Math from Swarthmore College in 1962 and later received his Ph.D. under Richard Solomon from University of Pennsylvania in 1966. From there, he began his career at Yale. Eventually, Rescorla returned to the University of Pennsylvania to continue his research. One of Rescorla's significant contributions to psychology, with co-creator Allan Wagner, was the Rescorla-Wagner Model of conditioning. This model expanded knowledge on learning processes. Rescorla also continued to develop research on Pavlovian conditioning and instrumental training. Due to his achievements, Rescorla received the American Psychological Association Awards of the Distinguished Scientific Contributions in 1986. Rescorla died March 24, 2020, after complications from a fall.  Background and education  Robert A. Rescorla was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on May 9, 1940. He attended high school in Westfield, New Jersey. In 1958, he decided to enter Swarthmore College where he got his first taste of research, conducting experiments on monkeys with Henry Gleitman and serving as Solomon Asch's research assistant doing human learning experiments. He graduated in 1962 with the highest honors. In 1966, he received his Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania.  Career  Rescorla taught at Yale University from 1966 to 1981. While at Yale, Rescorla began a fruitful collaboration with colleague Allan Wagner, which led to the development of the Rescorla–Wagner model. In 1975, he was elected into the Society of Experimental Psychologists. Rescorla returned to his alma mater and began teaching there in 1981. He served as chair of psychology department at Penn, as well as the Director of Undergraduate Studies and the dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. In 1984, Rescorla was granted a Guggenheim Fellowship. In 1985, Rescorla was elected into the National Academy of Sciences and was also awarded the Distinguished Scientific Contribution award of the American Psychological Association in 1986. In 1989, he was named University of Pennsylvania's James M. Skinner Professor of Science. In 1991, Rescorla was awarded the Howard Crosby Warren Medal by the Society of Experimental Psychologists.http://www.yale.edu/wagner/biog.html Biographical Sketch of Robert A. Rescorla, Retrieved November 11, 2016 He also received the Ira Abrams Distinguished Teaching Award of the School of Arts and Sciences at Penn in 1999, following in 2000, he was also appointed the Christopher H. Browne Distinguished Professor of Psychology. In 2005, Rescorla received the Horsley Grantt Award of the Pavlovian Society. Following that, in 2006, he was granted an honorary doctoral degree by the Universiteit Gent, in Belgium. He was elected into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2008.  Research and contributions  Rescorla conducted research at the University of Pennsylvania on animal learning and behavior, focusing on associative learning and particularly Pavlovian conditioning. = The Rescorla-Wagner Theory = In 1972, Robert A. Rescorla and his colleague, Allan R. Wagner, published the Rescorla–Wagner model of associative learning. This model conceptualizes learning as the development of associations between conditioned (CS) and unconditioned (US) stimuli, with learning occurring when these stimuli are paired on discrete trials. The change in the association between a CS and a US that occurs when the two are paired depends on how strongly the US is predicted on that trial – that is, informally, how \\"surprised\\" the organism is by the US. The amount of this \\"surprise\\" depends on the summed associative strength of all cues present during that trial. In contrast, previous models derived the change in associative strength from the current value of the CS alone. The model has been extremely influential, leading to many new experimental findings and theoretical developments.Rescorla, R.A., & Wagner, A.R. (1972). A theory of Pavlovian conditioning: Variations in the effectiveness of reinforcement and nonreinforcement. In A.H. Black & W.F. Prokasy, Eds., Classical Conditioning II, pp. 64–99. Appleton-CenturyCrofts. = Research program = Rescorla's interest in associative learning processes focused on three questions. First, in what situations does associative learning occur? Second, when associative learning occurs, what elements are involved? Third, what principles account for the experimental findings. To research these questions, Rescorla and his team used an assortment of methods, including for example fear conditioning, reward training and autoshaping.  Representative publications  *Rescorla, R.

Track brakes are a form of brakes unique to railborne vehicles. The braking force derives from the friction resulting from the application of wood or metal braking shoes directly to the tracks (as the name suggests). Early examples of track brakes used on the horse hauled mineral tramways that preceded the steam locomotive were described as sledge brakes, and are usually associated with lines that used gravity propulsion. In 1849 locomotive engineer Daniel Gooch fitted early examples of his Corsair Class tank engine with these devices; later these were replace with a conventional wheel brake. Early systems used manual force to apply the braking shoes; more recently system have used arrays of electromagnets to hold the shoes against the rail. In some applications, the shoes are applied by powerful springs, and held off by mechanical or electro-magnetic force. Electromagnetic track brakes = Requirement = The grip of steel wheels on steel rails tends to be less than is the case with rubber tires, though sanding (dropping gritty material on the track) does compensate if wheel slippage occurs. Therefore when light-rail systems or trams share space with pedestrians, automobiles and other road traffic, or where the vehicles operate on steep track, safety demands that the tram be fitted with electromagnetic track braking for emergency use. In a different context, some high-speed trains, such as the Adtranz X 2000 on Swedish State Railways, are fitted with the equipment, again for emergency use only. = Operation = The power of electromagnetic track brakes comes from electromagnetic attraction between the brake and the track. They are intended to provide retardation beyond the adhesion limit of the wheels alone, which ultimately is limited by the weight of the vehicle. Track brakes are fitted on the bogies between each pair of wheels and in line with the running rails. In operation they are first dropped into position on the rails, using air actuators, and then current is applied to strong electromagnet coils within the shoes. This pulls the brake shoes hard against the track with a force that can exceed the vehicle's weight, and strong braking forces result. Because of the risk of damage to the trackwork at railroad switches, etc., track brakes are typically recommended for use only in emergency situations, adding their force to the main brakes (electric brakes and disc brakes) – especially vital if a tram or train loses control and application of sand is ineffective, or the disc brakes have failed. In practice, some rail systems (such as the MBTA Green Line in Boston, Massachusetts) use them much more frequently, to compensate for rails made slippery by weather conditions, or as a roll-back prevention measure on hills. Track brakes are usually operated by a driver’s emergency stop button mounted separately to the normal traction/brake controller, or by the release of the “dead man’s handle”. Systems which use them frequently may have a separate switch to actuate the track brake without activating other emergency stopping measures. On some systems, permanent magnet track brakes are used as parking brakes. Cable car track brakes The cable cars of San Francisco are fitted with mechanical track brakes, controlled by a large braking lever next to the grip lever. Pulling back on this lever forces replaceable pine wood blocks against the rails; as a result, a cable car descending a steep hill emits an odor of smoldering wood. These track brakes are routinely used many times while traversing a cable car route. The true emergency brake on a cable car is called a \\"slot blade\\"; a steel wedge that can be forced into the slot-rail between the running rails by a strong spring. If a runaway car is moving fast enough that the slot blade is necessary, the friction has been known to weld the blade to the slot rail, disabling the transit line until the obstruction can be extracted with a cutting torch. The slot blade is controlled by the large red lever near the grip, and is used only for emergency stops. See also * Eddy current brake * Brake run for information on skid brakes and magnetic brakes.

Much of the coverage focuses on the Provo-Orem metropolitan area in Utah Valley. The Daily Herald is owned by Ogden Newspapers. The paper has a daily circulation of 32,000, with a Thursday circulation of 42,000 and a Sunday circulation of 36,000. It also owns nine community publications in Utah and Sanpete counties. History The earliest predecessor of the Daily Herald, the Provo Daily Times, was founded in 1873. It was the first newspaper to be published in Provo, when Utah was still a frontier territory. The paper eventually changed its name to the Enquirer, and then to the Provo Post. A competitor, the Utah County Democrat, was founded in 1898 and renamed the Provo Herald in 1909. In 1924 the Provo Post and the Provo Herald merged, forming a final foundation for the later Daily Herald. The company was purchased in 1926 by James G. Scripps, eldest son of newspaper magnate E. W. Scripps. Scripps League Newspapers held the newspaper until 1996, when it was sold to Pulitzer, which held it for almost a decade. In 2005 Pulitzer was sold to Lee Enterprises. In February 2009, the Daily Herald announced it would discontinue five weekly papers that had covered northern Utah County: the American Fork Citizen, Pleasant Grove Review, Lehi Free Press, Lone Peak Press and Orem Times. Subscribers to those papers, which were published every Thursday and had a combined circulation of 5,800, instead began receiving Thursday issues of the Herald, leading to a higher subscription count that day. At that time the weekly papers in southern Utah County were not affected. However, by January 2011, it announced that it would entirely discontinue the weekly newspapers that covered southern Utah County (Springville Herald, Spanish Fork Press, and Nebo Reporter) and incorporate their content into daily publication of the Daily Herald. By April 2013, the online editions of all the northern Utah County publications, except the American Fork Citizen have been discontinued. However, an online edition of The Pyramid (Mount Pleasant in Sanpete County) is also published. In February 2013, the Daily Herald announced that it would no longer publish a daily opinion page. This change came shortly after 10 percent of its workforce, including the executive editor, was laid off. As of May 2013, a replacement executive editor, nor an interim executive editor, had not been identified, leaving the possibility that the position may be permanently eliminated. In April 2014, Bob Williams was named publisher,http://www.heraldextra.com/news/local/bob-williams-succeeds-rona- rahlf-as-publisher-in-provo/article_81864afa-c008-11e3-954e-0019bb2963f4.html and in September 2015, the \\"Daily Herald\\" named Scott Tittrington and Jordan Carroll as co-managing editors. http://www.heraldextra.com/news/local/daily- herald-announces-management- changes/article_1eb7065d-62f0-5161-a23d-8c8abd59ea1d.html In 2016, Lee Enterprises sold the Daily Herald to Ogden Newspapers.Lee Enterprises to sell Provo (UT) Daily Herald to Ogden Newspapers  Notes  References External links * Newspapers published in Utah Companies based in Utah Daily Herald Publications established in 1873 1873 establishments in Utah Territory ","title":"Daily Herald (Utah)"},{"id":"4316324","text":"Coronado High School is the second newest high school in the Lubbock Independent School District.

It is part of a system of small cinder cones on the northwest flank of Newberry Volcano, a massive shield volcano which rises to the southeast. The cinder cone is capped by a crater which extends about deep beneath its south rim, and deep from the summit on its north side. Lava Butte is part of the Newberry National Volcanic Monument.  Volcanic history  Route 97. Like the other cinder cones in the area, Lava Butte only experienced a single eruption, dated by geologists in 1977 to 6,150 carbon-14 years, equivalent to about 7,000 years ago. The eruption began with a fissure spewing hot cinders to form the cone. In the next phase, a river of hot basalt flowed from the base of the small volcano to cover a large area to the west with a lava flow which remains largely free of vegetation. The lava flows reached the Deschutes River about to the west of the cone, burying its former channel under over of lava and damming the river to form a lake, known as Lake Benham. The river eventually overflowed the lava dam and eroded down into it, draining the lake and forming Benham Falls. Geologists estimate that 90% of the magma erupted as lava flows, 9% as scoria which forms the cone, and 1% as volcanic ash which forms a thin layer extending to the north.  Human history  Lava Butte from the south The early history of Lava Butte is not known, but it is assumed that Native Americans observed the eruptions and later ascended the prominent new landmark. White settlers arriving in the 1800s also noted the landmark. In 1903, I.C. Russell was the first geologist to study the butte and speculated that it erupted as recently as 150 years ago. Dr. Howel Williams estimated it to be much older, but incorrectly at 1,000 years old. In September 1914, Lava Butte \\"erupted\\" when the Bend Chamber of Commerce simulated an eruption to surprise a visiting Portland group. In 1925, USGS geologist Harold Stearns studied the Newberry area and recognized the fissure system which extends from Lava Butte to East Lake within Newberry Caldera. Sometime after 1901, the Great Northern Railway was extended south through the area. The construction crew built the rail line directly through the ʻAʻā lava flow of Lava Butte. Sign at the summit of the butte The cinder cone was also exploited to some extent for its economic value. In June 1926, a quarry was developed in the fault scarp east of Lava Butte as a source for paving material for the first The Dalles-California Highway (later U.S. Route 97). In November 1929, cinders from Lava Butte were shipped to Longview, Washington, to be used in construction of Longview Bridge across Columbia River. A United States Forest Service fire lookout tower was built on the summit in 1931, and in early 1933 a steep, single-lane road was constructed spiraling up to the summit. In February of that year, the local Skyliners ski club proposed a ski jump on Lava Butte, but it was never built. In June 1946, widening of the road up Lava Butte to two lanes was completed, along with constructing two small parking lots at the summit. The road was later paved in July 1950. The original lookout was replaced with a larger one in 1957, which was subsequently enlarged in 1962 to accommodate a small visitor center and museum on the first floor. In 1998 this was replaced with a new lookout built in the original L-4 style of 1931. In July 1966, twenty-two astronauts trained in Central Oregon for the upcoming Moon landings, at sites including Lava Butte, Lava River Cave, and Newberry Crater. In May 1967 the U.S. Forest Service created the Lava Butte Geological Area to protect the cinder cone, with plans for recreational and interpretive development. Construction of the Lava Lands Visitor Center located just south of the cone began in April 1969 and it was finally dedicated in September 1975. In November 1990, Newberry National Volcanic Monument was created encompassing Newberry Crater, Lava Cast Forest Geological Area, Lava River Cave, and the Lava Butte Geological Area. From early May to mid October, a shuttle transports visitors up Red Cinder Road from the Lava Lands Visitor Center to the lookout on Lava Butte. Hiking up Red Cinder Road is a year-round option. A scenic rim trail around the top of Lava Butte is long.

The first generation rechargeable alkaline batteries were introduced by Union Carbide and Mallory in the early 1970s. Several patents were introduced after Union Carbide's product discontinuation and eventually, in 1986, Battery Technologies Inc of Canada was founded to commercially develop a 2nd generation product based on those patents. Their first product to be licensed out and sold commercially was to Rayovac under the trademark \\"Renewal\\".http://www10.zetatalk.com/docs/Batteries/Alkaline/Reusable_Alkaline_Battery_From_Rayovac_2007.pdf The next year, \\"Pure Energy\\" batteries were released by Pure Energy. After reformulating the Renewals to be mercury free in 1995, subsequent licensed RAM alkalines were mercury free and included ALCAVA, AccuCell, Grandcell and EnviroCell. Subsequent patent and advancements in technology have been introduced. The formats include AAA, AA, C, D, and snap-on 9-volt batteries. Rechargeable alkaline batteries are manufactured fully charged and have the ability to hold their charge for years, longer than NiCd and NiMH batteries, which self-discharge.David Linden, Thomas Reddy (ed.), \\"Handbook of Batteries Third Edition\\", McGraw Hill, 2002 chapter 36 Rechargeable zinc/alkaline/manganese dioxide batteries Rechargeable alkaline batteries can have a high recharging efficiency and have less environmental impact than disposable cells.  Construction of rechargeable cells  Unlike disposable alkaline batteries, rechargeable alkaline batteries are designed by the manufacturer to be rechargeable. Rechargeable alkaline cells are constructed very similarly to disposable alkaline cells. A cathode paste is pressed into a steel can that forms the positive terminal of the battery. The negative electrode consists of zinc powder suspended in a gel, with a steel nail contact that runs to the base of the cell to form the negative terminal. Features of the rechargeable alkaline that differ from a disposable alkaline cell include the presence of barium sulfate or other additives in the cathode mix, which improve cycling and increase capacity by preventing the formation of insoluble manganese compounds. The cathode also has a catalyst to recombine any hydrogen that forms; hydrogen is produced as the fine zinc grains created during recharge are corroded by the electrolyte. Zinc oxide is added to the cathode mix to reduce generation of hydrogen gas; the zinc oxide dissociates on charge to form oxygen. The separator between anode and cathode is formulated to be particularly resistant to growth of zinc grains, which could penetrate and short-circuit the cell. The cells are manufactured in the charged state, ready to use. Although these batteries can be used in any device that supports a standard size (AA, AAA, C, D, etc.), they are formulated to last longest in periodical use items. This type of battery is better suited for use in low-drain devices such as remote controls or for devices that are used periodically such as flashlights (torches), television remote control handsets, portable radios, etc. If they are discharged by less than 25%, they can be recharged for hundreds of cycles to about 1.42 V. If they are discharged by less than 50%, they can be almost fully recharged for a few dozen cycles, to about 1.32 V. After a deep discharge, they can be brought to their original high-capacity charge only after a few charge-discharge cycles. Recharging of disposable alkalines Manufacturers do not support recharging of disposable alkaline batteries, and warn that it may be dangerous.Duracell disposable alkaline cells are marked \\"Do not ... charge ... Battery may explode or leak.\\" Despite this advice, alkaline batteries have been recharged, and chargers have been available.Description and test of a charger sold for recharging disposable alkaline batteries. It was tested by discharging batteries until completely dead, and recharged them successfully, to lower capacity than original capacity, a few times. Other chargers warn that they \\"will revive partially discharged batteries, but will not restore completely dead\\" ones. The capacity of a recharged alkaline battery declines with number of recharges, until it becomes unusable after typically about ten cycles. Low-ripple direct current is not suitable for charging disposable alkaline batteries; more suitable is a current pulsed at a rate of 40 to 200 pulses per second, with an 80% duty cycle. Pulsed charging appears to reduce the risk of electrolyte—usually potassium hydroxide (KOH)—leakage. The charging current must be low to prevent rapid production of gases that can rupture the cell. Cells that have leaked electrolyte are unsafe and unsuitable for reuse. Fully discharged cells recharge less successfully than only partly depleted cells, particularly if they have been stored in a discharged state—battery charger manufacturers do not claim to recharge dead cells. Attempting to recharge a discharged alkaline battery can cause the production of gas within the sealed canister; pressure generated by rapid accumulation of gas can open the pressure relief seal and cause leakage of electrolyte. Potassium hydroxide in the electrolyte is corrosive and may cause injury and damage, particularly corroding the battery contacts in the equipment. As an alkaline battery is discharged, chemicals inside the battery react to create an electric current. As the chemicals are used up and the products of the reaction accumulate, eventually the battery is no longer able to deliver adequate current, and the battery is depleted. By driving a current through the battery in the reverse direction, the equilibrium can be shifted back towards the original reactants. Different batteries rely on different chemical reactions. Some reactions are readily reversible, some are not. The reactions used in most alkaline batteries fall into the latter category. In particular, the metallic zinc generated by driving a reverse current through the cell will generally not return to its original location in the cell, and may form crystals that damage the separator layer between battery anode and electrolyte.  Comparison to other rechargeable batteries  The rechargeable alkaline battery was, at one time, cheaper than other rechargeable types. Cells can be manufactured in the fully charged state and retain capacity well. Their capacity is about 2/3 that of primary cells. They are of dry-cell construction, completely sealed and not requiring maintenance. Cells have a limited cycle life, which is affected by deep discharge; the first cycle gives the greatest capacity, and if deeply discharged a cell may only provide 20 cycles. The available energy on each cycle decreases. Like primary alkaline cells, they have a relatively high internal resistance, making them unsuitable for high discharge current (for example, discharging their full capacity in one hour). Unlike rechargeable alkaline batteries, NiMH batteries can endure anywhere from a few hundred to a thousand (or more) deep discharge cycles, resulting in a long useful life; their limitation is now more usually by age rather than cycles. Capacity of NiMH batteries is close to that of alkaline batteries. Unlike all alkaline batteries (rechargeable or otherwise), internal resistance is low. This makes them well suited for high current capacity applications. Self-discharge rates are comparable, at least up to six months. Rechargeable alkaline batteries produce a voltage of about 1.5V, compared with NiCd and NiMH batteries which produce about 1.2V. For some applications, this can make a significant difference. In cases where resistance is not significantly dependent on voltage or current, since power varies as the square of voltage, rechargeable alkaline batteries provide about 50% more power. For example, incandescent lamps are much brighter when powered by rechargeable alkaline batteries rather than NiCd or NiMH batteries.  Environmental notes  Rechargeable alkaline batteries are developed from primary alkaline batteries, designed to resist leakage that a recharge could cause, so they can be safely recharged many times. According to the websites of EnviroCell and PureEnergy and according to old Rayovac packaging, these manufacturers' rechargeable alkaline batteries have no mercury or cadmium.

Zmax is designed to replace Zmodem. It uses 32 bit CRC's on file data blocks, the same as Zmodem, and 32 bit CRC's on its information blocks where Zmodem uses 16 bit. In stream mode Zmax sends blocks, the size being set by the receiver, of data but doesn't require ACKs from the receiver. Zmax should (depending on equipment, phone lines, implementation, etc.) allow about 97.5 percent efficiency at 2400 baud on a 30K file compared to Zmodem's 95 percent. Unlike Zmodem, Zmax reaches full speed on considerably smaller files. In fact, due to less overhead associated with small files, it achieves a better efficiency rating. In Non-Stream mode (which can be set by the receiver or the sender), Zmax is a super Batch Xmodem or Ymodem depending on the block size, because it uses 32 bit CRCs instead of 16. Unlike Zmodem which sets an upper limit of 1024 bytes on block sizes, Zmax has an upper limit of over 32K. Because of this, Zmax may be used as a mailer protocol without any modifications. Zmax also has a lot less CPU overhead than Zmodem, so slower computers can drive highspeed modems faster. Zmax does not encode each byte of data like Zmodem does. This reduces the amount of CPU overhead and simplifies the code quite a bit.

Berger. It stars Richard Gere, Kim Basinger, Uma Thurman, Eric Roberts, Keith David, and Paul Guilfoyle. The executive producers were Gere and Maggie Wilde. The film received mixed critical reviews, but was positively compared to the works of Alfred Hitchcock, particularly Vertigo. It is the final film of director of photography Jordan Cronenweth. Plot In San Francisco, Freudian psychiatrist Isaac Barr treats Diana Baylor, a woman with obsessive–compulsive disorder suffering from frightening and horrific childhood memories, which include images of her drunken father and his death in a fire for which she wasn't blamed. Isaac becomes concerned about Diana's obsessive-compulsive habit of checking a handgun her sister gave her. Diana suggests Isaac meet her sister, Heather Evans, who knows things about their parents that may shed light on her neuroses. Heather tells him that Diana was sexually assaulted by their father, and denies giving her the gun. She reveals to him that she's unhappily married to a gangster, Jimmy Evans, whom she's afraid to leave under threat of retaliation. Isaac confesses that he finds her irresistible, and the two have sex. Afterwards, Heather divulges that her and Diana’s mother left after their father raped Diana. Subsequently, their father died in a fire, which police suspected Diana might have started. Heather defended her sister, who has since blocked the ordeal out of her memory. During a public dinner with Jimmy, Heather induces an episode of \\"pathological intoxication\\" by drinking wine and is subsequently taken to the hospital. After recovering in the emergency room, she sneaks away with Isaac to an abandoned lighthouse near the Golden Gate Bridge. While climbing the stairs to a balcony, she accidentally drops her purse and lets loose a metal dumbbell handle, which she claims she keeps for protection. Determined to help Heather leave her husband, Isaac asks his friend, defense attorney Mike O'Brien, to investigate Jimmy's illegal activities. Mike informs Isaac that Jimmy is under federal investigation for a myriad of financial crimes. He warns Isaac to stay away from the gangster’s wife, but the infatuated Isaac follows her and Jimmy to a restaurant. Claiming she feels ill, Heather leaves the restaurant early, and gets a ride home from Isaac. Later that night, she drinks cough medicine, which brings on another episode of pathological intoxication. As Jimmy forces a kiss on her, she grabs one of his metal dumbbells and uses it to knock him in the head. He falls into a filled bathtub and drowns. Heather is arrested and held on suspicion of Jimmy's death. Isaac hires Mike to represent her, and enlists the help of an expert on pathological intoxication. The expert testifies in court that several of his patients have done harm to themselves or others in the throes of pathological intoxication. Due to the testimony and the absence of a murder weapon, Heather is found not responsible for Jimmy’s murder, due to temporary insanity. However, she is sentenced to confinement at to a psychiatric facility, where she will be released in four to six weeks, pending evaluation. Isaac serves as the head of psychiatry at Overland, and assures Heather she will be released as soon as possible. During a symposium, Isaac overhears a colleague give a speech on one of Sigmund Freud patients who had persistent dreams of arranging flowers, the same dream Diana had described to him during an earlier session. Isaac realizes that Diana fabricated those stories. He confronts a courthouse guard who recognized Heather before her trial, and he recalls that she used to frequent the courthouse as a spectator, whenever Isaac testified on behalf of the insane. Mike tells Isaac that Jimmy's brother recently died, making Heather the beneficiary of Jimmy's $4 million life insurance policy. Isaac goes to the hospital to confront Heather, who admits to the ruse but threatens him not to cross her. She claims to have hidden the dumbbell she used to murder Jimmy, which is covered in Isaac’s fingerprints after he touched it at the lighthouse. Outside the hospital, police detective Huggins approaches Isaac, whom he suspects of murdering his lover’s husband in exchange for a cut of Jimmy’s life insurance policy. Isaac returns to the psychiatric hospital and tells Heather that he has reported her crime to two assistant district attorneys who want to interview her. She reminds him that double jeopardy prevents her from being tried twice, and agrees to the inquiry. During the evaluation, Isaac observes as Heather gives a false report of the crime, blaming Isaac for killing her husband. At Heather’s request, Diana joins her, but fails to bring the dumbbell, which Heather planned to hand over as evidence of Isaac’s guilt. Heather screams at her sister, and further loses her temper when she discovers the interrogators are hospital psychiatrists, not prosecutors as Isaac said. She is sedated and dragged away by orderlies. Sometime later, Isaac meets Diana, who has changed her hair to look like Heather’s. She assures him that she dropped the incriminating dumbbell into the bay, but Isaac does not trust her. Isaac enlists Pepe Carrero, a former client, to follow Diana when she visits her sister. Although Heather wants Diana to deliver the dumbbell to Detective Huggins, Diana is too nervous to go through with it. Heather coerces her to switch clothes in the bathroom, allowing Heather to escape the hospital as “Diana,” while Diana stays behind as an inmate. Pepe follows Heather, and tries to steal the dumbbell from her, but she retaliates by shooting him in the chest. She telephones Huggins and arranges to meet him at a marina. Isaac catches up to Pepe just as he is being taken away in an ambulance. Pepe directs him to the marina, where Isaac intervenes just as Heather passes off the dumbbell to Huggins. Isaac grabs the dumbbell, rendering his old fingerprints inadmissible. Heather takes the two hostages at gunpoint, and forces Huggins to drive away from the marina. A rainstorm hits, and he crashes into the ocean. Isaac escapes the sinking car and Heather follows him to the abandoned lighthouse, situated nearby. As she chases Isaac onto the balcony, he deduces that Heather was the one who was raped by her father, not Diana, and she must have started the fire that killed him. Heather admonishes him for trying to “shrink” her. A portion of the balcony breaks off, causing Isaac to fall. Just then, Huggins appears. Heather points her gun at him, but Isaac reaches up from the dangling balcony and pulls her over the edge. She falls to her death, and Isaac scrambles back inside. Diana is tried as Heather’s accomplice, but is found not guilty. Sometime later, posing as Heather, she seduces a wealthy man, and pretends to have a condition that forbids her from drinking.

The channel primarily airs true crime programming and dramas targeted towards women. The network was founded by Geraldine Laybourne, and carried a format focused on lifestyle and entertainment programming oriented towards women, similar to competing channels such as Lifetime. NBCUniversal acquired the network in 2007; under NBCU ownership, the network increasingly produced reality shows aimed at the demographic, and was relaunched in 2014 to target a \\"modern\\", younger female audience. After the network experienced ratings successes with a programming block dedicated to such programming, Oxygen was relaunched in mid-2017 to focus primarily on true-crime programs. As of February 2015, approximately 77.5 million American households (66.5% of households with television) receive Oxygen. Under its current format, the network primarily competes with Investigation Discovery and HLN. History Until 2004 the entire word was in smaller case letters. The privately held company Oxygen Media was founded in 1998 by former Nickelodeon executive Geraldine Laybourne, talk-show host Oprah Winfrey, media executive Lisa Gersh, and producers Marcy Carsey, Tom Werner and Caryn Mandabach (of Carsey-Werner fame). Laybourne was the service's founder, chairwoman, and CEO, staying with the channel until the NBCUniversal sale. The company's subscription network Oxygen launched on February 2, 2000. The channel's first headquarters were at Battery Park City in New York City, near the World Trade Center. It was knocked off the air on September 11, 2001; the Time Warner Cable-owned regional news channel NY1 was broadcast to all Oxygen subscribers across the country until the studio reopened within a week after the attack. The network's operations were later consolidated in the Chelsea Market, a former Nabisco factory at 15th Street and Ninth Avenue in New York City. Oxygen's operations are now based at 30 Rockefeller Plaza as part of Comcast's consolidation of its newly owned NBC Universal properties. The channel originally began as an interactive service focusing on original programming with some reruns (such as Kate & Allie), and featured a black bar at the bottom of the screen (referred to as \\"the stripe\\", occupying the bottom 12% of the screen) which would show various information (the interactive part involved the channel's website); the technique was cloned by Spike's precursor The New TNN; the stripe was eventually dropped. Prior to 2005, the channel carried a limited schedule of regular season WNBA games produced by NBA TV. The channel later began to focus chiefly on reality shows, reruns, and movies. For a time during the talk show's syndication run, Oxygen aired week-delayed repeats of The Tyra Banks Show. The yoga/meditation/exercise program Inhale was the last inaugural Oxygen program on air into the channel's NBC Universal era, albeit in repeats; it was cancelled in 2010. Campus Ladies, Bliss, Oprah After the Show, Talk Sex with Sue Johanson, The Janice Dickinson Modeling Agency, Snapped, Girls Behaving Badly and Bad Girls Club, a reality series, were the highlight shows of the network at this time. Oxygen launched with immediate DirecTV carriage, and arrived on Dish Network in early 2006 during that provider's carriage conflict with Lifetime. = Acquisition by NBC Universal = Oxygen logo (2008-2014) On October 9, 2007, NBC Universal announced it would be purchasing Oxygen for $925 million. The sale was completed on November 20, 2007. NBC Universal's cable division announced at an industry upfront presentation on April 23, 2008, that the channel would rebrand and unveil a new logo on June 17, 2008; in the months since the sale the Oh! heading was dropped from the channel's visual branding. The logo premiered one week early on June 8, 2008. For the 2008 Summer Olympics, Oxygen aired events and programming weeknights relating to gymnastics, equestrian, and synchronized swimming through NBC's Olympic broadcasts. On June 29, 2009, Oxygen premiered Dance Your Ass Off, a reality dance competition program in which overweight people dance while they lose weight; the program was cancelled after its second season due to low ratings. On April 5, 2010, Oxygen launched its second night of original programming with the fifth-season premiere of Tori & Dean: Home Sweet Hollywood. Following the acquisition of NBC Universal by Comcast and the last-minute replacement of its subscription channel Style Network with Esquire Network (which was originally intended to replace G4) on September 23, 2013, some of its acquired programs were dispersed to Oxygen. Oyxgen logo (2014–2017) In April 2014, as part of a gradual re-focusing of NBCU's women's pay-TV networks by new division head Bonnie Hammer, and the appointment of Frances Berwick as the head of Oxygen and sister network Bravo, it was revealed that Oxygen would undergo a shift in its programming strategy to focus on a \\"modern\\", young female audience. Berwick explained that the new slate, which included upcoming series such as Fix My Choir, Funny Girls, Nail'd It, Sisterhood of Hip Hop, Street Art Throwdown, and planned spin-offs of Preachers of L.A., would \\"deliver on the freshness, authenticity, high emotional stakes and optimism that this demographic is looking for\\", and that many of the new programs would \\"appeal to things that are important in the lives of young, millennial women\\" and be \\"authentic\\". As part of the re-focusing, the network also introduced a new slogan, \\"Very Real\\". =2017: Re-focus on true crime= In December 2016, it was reported that NBCUniversal was considering reformatting Oxygen as a true crime-oriented channel. Since 2015, the genre had seen growing interest, especially among young adult women. The network had introduced a primetime block known as Crime Time on Fridays through Mondays (anchored by series such as Snapped), which had helped Oxygen see a 42% increase in total viewership, and a 22% increase among women 25–54. NBCUniversal had reportedly been in talks with Dick Wolf—producer of NBC's Law and Order and Chicago franchises—to take an equity stake in a re-branded channel that could be led by reruns of the programs. In January 2017, the network also began a foray into podcasting, with the true crime series Martinis & Murder. In February 2017, NBCUniversal confirmed that it planned to re-format Oxygen with a focus on true crime programming aimed towards women. The change was accompanied by a larger re- branding later in the year, with a new logo featuring the Oxygen name rendered in the style of yellow police tape. Oxygen's new lineup was built largely around its existing library of unscripted crime-oriented programming (such as Snapped and its various spin-offs); NBCUniversal Lifestyle Networks president Frances Berwick explained that they had not ruled out adding off-network reruns of police procedurals, such as the Chicago, CSI and NCIS franchises as well (with the latter two having already been aired by the network by that time). Berwick stated that the network had not determined the fate of the network's non-crime programming, such as Bad Girls Club, after the full re- branding takes effect. During its upfront presentations, Oxygen unveiled other new crime programs that were in development for the upcoming season, such the new Dick Wolf series Criminal Confessions, and a docuseries on the murder of Jessica Chambers co-produced with NBCUniversal-funded BuzzFeed. Oxygen also acquired a new season of another Dick Wolf series, Cold Justice (which had been cancelled by TNT). In September 2017, Oxygen and USA Network acquired off-network reruns of Chicago P.D., which were added to their schedules in October 2017.

Even higher speeds are possible with buffered or error correcting modems. A number of features, such as 32bit CRC protection, Full- Streaming-Error-Recovery and Dynamic-Code-Substitution contribute to performance and security. HS/Link can resume an aborted transfer, verifying all existing data blocks to ensure the resumed file completely matches the file being transmitted.
