Dobbins (1836 - circa 1869) was a Confederate cavalry commander in the American Civil War. Early life Archibald Stephenson Dobbins was the son of David and Catherine Dobbins and was born on his father's farm known as Sandy Hook near Mount Pleasant, Tennessee. Shortly after his marriage to Mary Patience Dawson, also of Mount Pleasant, he moved to Arkansas, acquiring land called Horse Shoe Island Plantation, near Helena.Garrett Civil War In 1862 Phillips County, Arkansas, was occupied by Federal troops. Dobbins sent his family to Tennessee and joined a Confederate regiment commanded by Thomas C. Hindman. When Hindman was appointed to take over the military command of Arkansas, he brought Dobbins with him to Little Rock as a colonel on his general staff. Following his service on Hindman's staff, Dobbins was given command of a brigade of cavalry that became known as ‚ÄúDobbins Cavalry‚Äù or more formally the 1st Arkansas Cavalry. Dobbins returned with his cavalry to Phillips County which became his base of operations. Dobbins Cavalry is difficult to research because not only was it a loosely organized regiment, but most of the typical paperwork generated by a regiment in the field is missing from the record. Only a handful of muster rolls, and almost no quartermaster or commissary reports, are known to exist.Howerton Dobbins brigade was assigned to a division commanded by Gen. Lucius M. Walker and fought in major engagements, raids, and skirmishes throughout eastern and northeastern Arkansas. After Walker was killed in a duel with fellow general John S. Marmaduke, Dobbins assumed command of Walker's division. When Marmaduke became Dobbins superior, Dobbins refused to serve under him in protest of the killing of Walker. Marmaduke ordered Dobbins arrest and court martial. On November 23, 1863, it was announced that Dobbins had been dismissed from the army. Despite the verdict, Dobbins never officially surrendered his command and continued to operate his brigade out of the Helena area. 1864 dispatches from Confederate Gen. Joe Shelby to his commanders in northeast Arkansas included Col. Dobbins. As the war was nearing the end, Dobbins was promoted to general on the field, but this promotion was never entered in the official records, due in part to the turmoil of the confederate army and government in its last days.Garrett Dobbin's Cavalry surrendered and was paroled at Wittsburg, Arkansas, on May 25, 1865. Dobbins himself fled to Texas where he planned to cross into Mexico and send his slaves to Cuba. Dobbins did not reach his slaves or Mexico and signed his parole at Galveston on July 13, 1865. Death In 1866 Dobbins was partner in a merchant house in New Orleans. In 1867 Dobbins, resenting being under Yankee rule, left the United States and started a plantation 30 miles from Santar√©m, Brazil. In one of his letters to his family Dobbins mentioned that he was only about six miles from an American colony in Brazil. This may have been the Lost Colony of the Confederacy. In 1869 Dobbins wrote for his wife to join him in Brazil but as she made plans to travel to South America, the letters stopped coming. Dobbins was never heard from again. Years later it was reported that the general had been killed in an Indian uprising which swept the area of his plantation in about 1869.Garrett However, a report in the Chicago Tribune, Jan. 13, 1881 suggests that he was living in Argentina at the time. A Confederate style VA headstone stands as a cenotaph to Archibald Dobbins in Confederate Cemetery in Helena, Arkansas.

The episode is written by Eliza Clark and is directed by Brad Anderson. In the episode, Sarah learns of Rosie's backpack and forces herself to confront Holder; Richmond ponders his future as a paraplegic mayoral candidate; and Mitch Larsen returns. Plot Mitch Larsen (Michelle Forbes) drives down a highway, with a photograph of her, her husband Stan, and daughter Rosie by her side. On the side of the road, she encounters a hitchhiker (Chelsea Ricketts) who resembles Rosie. Mitch continues on and checks into a motel room, where she opens her suitcase to remove a decorated shoebox. Sitting in a bar later, she does not answer a call from her sister Terry and notices a man looking her way. Later in her motel room, she hesitates to kiss the man, but then asks him to stay. The next day, she sees the teenage hitchhiker outside her window, smoking by the pool. At police headquarters, Sarah Linden (Mireille Enos) is told that the tattoo spotted in Rosie's Super 8 mm film is the manga character Ogi Jun. She asks if the client list from Beau Soleil's computer servers has been retrieved and is told that Lt. Erik Carlson held up the search warrant. She asks Lt. Carlson (Mark Moses) about the warrant, and he replies that she needs to ask him before requesting one, citing a crackdown on recent police procedure. Sarah visits the Larsen garage to ask Stan (Brent Sexton) if he recognizes a picture of the tattoo. He demands the return of Rosie's backpack, but after realizing Sarah doesn't even know about the backpack, he insists she leave. Sarah calls headquarters about the backpack and is told that someone took it. She finds her former boss, Michael Oakes (Garry Chalk), on his boat and asks him for the backpack. He hands her an evidence bag. At her car, she opens it to find Holder's blue backpack inside. At police headquarters, she again watches Rosie's Super 8 film as she calls Holder to leave a message saying she understands his recent actions. She is then informed that the building which houses the Beau Soleil computer servers was destroyed in a fire. At the scene of the fire, she is told there were no computers inside the building. She sees security cameras above the street and asks for footage, for which she will get a warrant later. Stan picks up the boys at school and sees that Denny (Seth Isaac Johnson) has a box of Polish pastries. His son tells him that and says Stan's \\"friend\\" gave it to him. Stan visits Janek Kovarsky (Don Thompson) to ask him to stay away from the boys and to investigate Beau Soleil. Janek lies to Stan, telling him that Beau Soleil only uses Russian girls and that there is no record of Rosie. He also leaves a copy of Rosie's file from the morgue with Stan, saying that Rosie was alive when the car went into the water. Outside of a Narcotics Anonymous meeting, Stephen Holder (Joel Kinnaman) chats with Claire (Sarah Strange), a fellow NA member. She goes to the meeting inside but he leaves, driving by his nephew Davie (Arien Boey) to offer him a ride, which Davie turns down, saying his mother has told him not to; both Holder and Davey seem regretful about this. Holder then visits his former drug dealer, a man named Logic (Sean Owen Roberts). They fight, and Holder leaves with a bag of methamphetamine. Sitting in his car outside an NA meeting and staring at the bag of meth, he looks up to see Claire walk out of the meeting. They later have sex in his car, after which she asks if he has any drugs. At the hospital, Darren Richmond (Billy Campbell) tells Dr. Alex Madigan (Andrew Airlie) that he felt the warm sunlight on his legs. The doctor calls it \\"phantom pain\\" and leaves. Jamie Wright (Eric Ladin) and Richmond watch television as Mayor Lesley Adams (Tom Butler) tells reporters that Richmond's involvement in the Larsen murder remains suspicious. Neurologist Andre Newman (Sean Devine) arrives to poke Richmond's leg. Richmond feels nothing but later insists on attending a future fundraiser. Jamie promises to tell the organization that Richmond will be attending. After Richmond realizes that a nurse (Lilli Clark) has changed his urinary catheter and he did not feel it, he sticks a campaign pin into his thigh and does not feel it either. At the campaign office, Gwen Eaton (Kristin Lehman) tells her father (Alan Dale) that she wants to work for Senator Farrelly in Washington, D.C. He then makes a call on her behalf. Driving home with son Jack (Liam James), Sarah calls to check on the security camera footage. She insists that Lt. Carlson does not need to know about the warrant. Jack picks up the Super 8 still of the Ogi Jun tattoo. He explains that Ogi Jun is a warrior avenging his murdered father. At her motel, she looks through Jack's Ogi Jun comic and sees numerous images of Ogi Jun, including one similar to the photographed tattoo. She watches footage on her computer from one of the security cameras. A Larsen delivery van appears in the video, and a close-up shows the Ogi Jun tattoo on the driver's arm. She receives a call from Claire, telling her that Holder is acting crazy. Sarah finds him pacing in a traffic median on a bridge. She tells him that she knows he switched the backpacks, convincing him to come with her. He leads her to his car, where she gets Rosie's backpack from its trunk. A man is seen deleting Beau Soleil files off a computer, then walks out into Janek's restaurant. In the Larsen garage, a man with the Ogi Jun tattoo backs a van out. Production Joel Kinnaman spoke about the scene between Holder and his nephew: \\"I really loved that scene. There were so many conflicting emotions, which is something I love to play. He has a desperation where he seeks his nephew out because he needs him. His nephew is one of the people that makes him feel like he's a good person. It makes him feel real and grounded, but at the same time he knows he's not supposed to [see him]. He's almost looking for help, but then he realizes he's using his favorite person for his own benefit, and it makes him feel ashamed. And [Arien Boey] who plays Davie is such a wonderful kid. He breaks my heart.\\" Reception =Critical reception= \\"Numb\\" received less-than-favorable reviews. Brandon Nowalk of The A.V.

It was originally developed by Gerard Gioia, Ph.D., Peter Isquith, Ph.D., Steven Guy, Ph.D., and Lauren Kenworthy, Ph.D. The 86-item questionnaire has separate forms for parents and teachers, and typically takes 10‚Äì15 minutes to administer and 15‚Äì20 minutes to score. Other versions of the BRIEF also exist for preschool children aged 2‚Äì5 (BRIEF-P), self-reports of adolescents aged 11‚Äì18 (BRIEF-SR), and self/informant-reports of adults aged 18‚Äì90 (BRIEF-A). History The BRIEF was developed in 2000 to address limitations of available assessments in examining real-world expressions of behaviors related to executive function; the scale was normed on data from 1419 parents (815 girls and 604 boys) and 720 teachers (403 girls and 317 boys) from a representative distribution of socioeconomic statuses. By design, the BRIEF is intended to provide a standardized method of asking multiple raters about executive functions in daily life in a manner that is not specific to any particular disorder. Because it is not disorder-specific, the BRIEF may be used to assess executive function behaviors in children and adolescents experiencing a wide range of difficulties, such as those related to learning, attention, brain injuries, developmental disorders, and various psychiatric conditions and medical issues. As of 2013, the BRIEF had been translated into 40 different languages or dialects across the various versions of the questionnaire. Test format Each form of the BRIEF parent- and teacher- rating form contains 86 items in eight non-overlapping clinical scales and two validity scales. These theoretically and statistically derived scales form two indexes: a) Behavioral Regulation (three scales) and b) Metacognition (five scales), as well as a Global Executive Composite score which takes into account all of the clinical scales and represents the child's overall executive function. There are also two validity scales to measure Negativity and Inconsistency of responses. Scores on the Negativity scale measures the extent to which the respondent answered selected items in an unusually negative manner whereas scores on the Inconsistency scale indicate the extent to which the respondent answered similar items in an inconsistent manner. =Behavioral regulation scales= * Inhibit: Ability to control impulses (inhibitory control) and to stop engaging in a behavior. * Shift: Ability to move freely from one activity or situation to another; to tolerate change; to switch or alternate attention. * Emotional Control: Ability to regulate emotional responses appropriately. =Metacognition scales= * Initiate: Ability to begin an activity and to independently generate ideas or problem-solving strategies. * Working Memory: Ability to hold information when completing a task, when encoding information, or when generating goals/plans in a sequential manner. * Plan/Organize: Ability to anticipate future events; to set goals; to develop steps; to grasp main ideas; to organize and understand the main points in written or verbal presentations. * Organization of Materials: Ability to put order in work, play and storage spaces (e.g., desks, lockers, backpacks, and bedrooms). * Monitor: Ability to check work and to assess one's own performance; ability to keep track of the effect of one's own behavior on other people. Administration The BRIEF is very simple to administer and only requires a copy of the form and a pencil. The parent form is filled out by a parent (preferably by both parents). The only important criterion is they need to have had recent contact with the child over the past six months. Similarly, the teacher form can be filled out by any adult (teacher or aide) who has had extended contact with the child in a school setting during the past month. Multiple ratings across classrooms are strongly recommended, as they are useful for comparison purposes. Reliability and validity Questions selected for inclusion in the BRIEF were determined based on inter-rater reliability correlations and item-total correlations that had the highest probability of being informative for the clinician. The BRIEF has demonstrated good reliability, with high test-retest reliability (rs ‚âà .88 for teachers, .82 for parents) internal consistency (Cronbach's alphas ‚âà .80 ‚Äì .98), and moderate correlations between parent and teacher ratings (rs ‚âà .32 ‚Äì .34). Evidence for the convergent and divergent aspects of the BRIEF's validity comes through its correlation with other measures of emotional and behavioral functioning. The BRIEF has also demonstrated utility in differentiating clinical and non-clinical children and adolescents with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Scoring and interpretation Raw scores for all scales of the BRIEF questionnaire can be computed with the Software Portfolio (BRIEF-SP). This computer program provides separate normative tables for both the Parent and Teacher Forms in which figure T scores, percentiles, and 90% confidence intervals for four developmental age groups (5‚Äì18 years) by gender of the child. T scores provide information about the child's individual scores relative to the scores of other respondents in the standardization sample. Percentiles represent the percentage of children in the standardization sample who fall below a given raw score. When interpreting the data, it is important to remember that all results \\"should be viewed in the context of a complete evaluation\\". Clinical information gathered from the BRIEF questionnaire is best understood within the context of a full assessment that includes a description of the history of the child and the family and observations of the child's behavior. Accordingly, high scores obtained on the BRIEF do not indicate a \\"disorder of executive function\\" but rather suggest a higher level of dysfunction in a specific domain of executive functions. Particular attention should also be paid to the Inconsistency scale given that score equal or higher than 7 is indicative of a high degree of inconsistency in rater response. Uses The BRIEF is useful for evaluating children with a variety of disorders and disabilities. Specifically, it is often used for assessing executive functioning in children with developmental and/or acquired neurological conditions including: learning disabilities, tourette syndrome, traumatic brain injury, pervasive developmental disorders, high functioning autism, low birth weight. The BRIEF is most often used to assess attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder The BRIEF is often used to evaluate ADHD in children and has been shown to be superior to other rating systems such as the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC) as it taps into unique behaviors typically associated with the disorder (e.g., working memory, metacognitive skills) McCandless & O'Laughlin (2007) found that the Metacognitive and Behavioral Regulation scales of the BRIEF are clinically useful for identifying children with and without ADHD. Specifically, the Metacognitive Scale (Working Memory subscale) is useful for identifying the presence of ADHD whereas the Behavioural Regulation scale (Inhibit subscale) has demonstrated clinical utility at distinguishing between the inattentive and combined (i.e., inattentive and hyperactive) subtypes of the disorder. The BRIEF has also been useful for highlighting differences between ADHD and other diagnoses. For example, Pratt (2000) examined parent reports on the BRIEF for children (ages 6‚Äì11) who had a diagnosis of ADHD, ADHD and reading disorder (RD), RD only, or no diagnosis. Children with ADHD demonstrated higher scores on all of the BRIEF scales compared to children with no formal diagnosis. Children with a reading disorder showed greater difficulties on the Working Memory and the Plan/Organize subscales of the Metacognitive Scale. The BRIEF has been less useful for distinguishing between children with ADHD and tourette syndrome.

The church was formerly named Church of the Holy Paraclete. In May 2016, the parish council voted to change the name of the church to an English translation. The theology of the parish is the same. Holy Paraclete (Gr. œÄŒ±œÅŒ¨Œ∫ŒªŒ∑œÑŒøœÇ, Lat. paracletus) means holy advocate or holy helper. In Christianity, the term most commonly refers to the Holy Spirit. The Church has Spanish Colonial architecture mixed with New England Fieldstone. It is a mission church in the tradition of the Old Catholic Church founded in America by Fr. Charles Chiniquy and Bishop Joseph Rene Vilatte of the American Catholic Church (No longer in existence). This community is not in union with the Episcopal Church, the Union of Utrecht, or any of the so-called Episcopi vagantes. The community strives after union with the Union of Utrecht, through the help of the Episcopal Church. The Mission Church houses a reliquary with the altar bells of Saint Damien of Molokai and a 17th-century Spanish Colonial Tabernacle. The Chapel of the Holy Spirit is in Rhode Island. The parish was founded in 2009 by the Little Brothers of Jesus Caritas, an ecumenical community following the inspiration of Bl. Charles de Foucauld. The parish community began at the locally famous Brooklyn Coffee and Tea House and after two years purchased the Carcieri property at 155 Douglas Avenue. The building was first constructed in 1910 and was part of a larger estate which was used as a front for illegal gambling and bootlegging. During the building's time of operation, prior to its religious use, pieces of the Space Shuttle Enterprise were produced in the building by C & C Engineering. The church completed its renovations in 2013. Old Catholicism in the United States Fr. Charles Chiniquy who inspired Joseph Ren√© Vilatte to minister to the community in Wisconsin In the area of Green Bay, Wisconsin, Joseph Ren√© Vilatte began working with Catholics of Belgian ancestry and with the knowledge and blessing of the Union of Utrecht and under the full jurisdiction of the local Episcopal Bishop of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, Bishop John Henry Hobart Brown. Vilatte was ordained a deacon on 6 June 1885 and priest on 7 June 1885 by the Most Rev. Eduard Herzog, bishop of the Christian Catholic Church of Switzerland. Vilatte's work provided the only sacramental presence in that particular part of rural Wisconsin (under the jurisdiction of the Episcopal Bishop of Fond du Lac). Vilatte received a stipend from the Episcopal Church aas well as aid to help build the Old Catholic Church in America under Bishop Brown. In time, Vilatte asked the Old Catholic Archbishop of Utrecht to be ordained a bishop so that he might confirm, but his petition was not granted because of Utrecht's desire for unity with the Episcopal Church and the political turmoil with the new bishop, Charles Chapman Grafton. Vilatte sought opportunities for consecration in the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox Churches. He was made a bishop in Ceylon, India on 28 May 1892 under the jurisdiction of the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch. Vilatte's consecration was in the line of St. Peter, the founder of the Church of Antioch. In 1908 the Archbishop of Utrecht, Gerardus Gul, consecrated Father Arnold Harris Mathew, a former Roman Catholic priest, as Regionary Bishop for England. His mission was to establish a community for Anglicans and Roman Catholics. In 1913, Bishop Mathew claimed to have secured permission from the continental Old Catholic bishops for his consecration of Rudolph Edward de Landen Berghes as a bishop to work among the Scots.St. Louis de France Cathedral of Green Bay, Wisconsin, 1895 Bishop de Berghes was frequently called \\"the Prince\\". He was of noble birth but had never claimed the title for himself. The title of \\"Prince\\" was rightfully that of his older brother who had died. When Bishop de Berghes became eligible to inherit he was in a religious community and could not accept the title. At the beginning of World War I, Bishop de Berghes went to the United States at the suggestion of the Anglican Primate, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Bishop Mathew later declared his autonomy from the Union of Utrecht, finding it too \\"protestant oriented\\". Mathew sent missionaries to the United States, including the theosophist Bishop J. I. Wedgwood (1892‚Äì1950) and Bishop Rudolph de Landas Berghes et de Rache (1873‚Äì1920). De Berghes arrived in the United States on 7 November 1914, hoping to unite the various independent Old Catholic jurisdictions under Archbishop Mathew. Bishop de Berghes, in spite of his isolation, was able to plant the seed of Old Catholicism in the Americas. He consecrated a former Capuchin Franciscan priest as bishop: Carmel Henry Carfora. From this the Old Catholic Church in the United States evolved into local and regional self-governing dioceses and provinces along the design of St. Ignatius of Antioch - a network of communities. Old Catholicism in the Rhode Island area In 1917, the first Old Catholic parish was built by Bishop Franciszek Hodur of the Polish National Catholic Church which was a member of the Union of Utrecht until 2003. Parishes were also constructed in Woonsocket and in the neighboring, Fall River, Massachusetts. Bishop Vilatte of the American Catholic Church was a colleague of his Polish counterparts and visited the communities in Rhode Island and Fall River. Many of these churches are still active today. Blessed Virgin Polish National Catholic Church, first Polish church in Fall River, Mass., 1898 In the April 1928 issue of the American Catholic Church newsletter, The Antiochean, Dr. Casmir Durand, is consecrated Bishop of the French-speaking churches and successor of Joseph Rene Vilatte. In May, Henri Perdriau of Rhode Island gave him his support and invited the Franco-Americans to join the church. He published under Bishop Durand's Imprimatur, and with his collaboration, the brochure called Fiat Lux- Le bon sens et la logique (common sense and logic). It was written after Rome had excommunicated the 56 leaders of a movement that was opposing the Roman Catholic Bishop W. Hickey of Providence, under the auspices of the newspaper La Sentinelle of Woonsocket, where Perdriau was a journalist. Bishop Hickey was forcing the French-speaking parishes of his diocese to fund English schools only, through compulsory taxes. Perdriau was also the master of Guido Nincheri who produced the famous stained glass and frescos found in St. Ann's Church in Woonsocket. Members of this new parish came from St. Ann's Church and Precious Blood Church. Bishop Durand wrote his essay, The Old Catholic Church while he was in Woonsocket, to establish a Franco-American parish. He celebrated the inaugural Mass in the Polish National Catholic Churchon Sunday, August 26, 1928 with 65 people in attendance. The Woonsocket parish was short lived. Eventually in 1929, the excommunicated protesters were readmitted to communion to the Roman Catholic Church and the Franco- American parish faded away. *First Polish Church of the Blessed Virgin Founded in 1898 in Fall River, Massachusetts.

Beliefs Pentecost Sunday 2011 \\"By maintaining and professing faithfully the doctrine of Jesus Christ, by refusing to admit those errors which by the fault of men have crept into the Catholic Church, by laying aside the abuses in ecclesiastical matters, together with the worldly tendencies of the hierarchy, we believe that we shall be able to combat efficaciously the great evils of our day, which are unbelief and indifference in matters of religion.\\" Declaration of Utrecht, 1889 Article 8 =Vilatte's community church model= \\"I visited the various families and urged them to ignore their doctrinal differences for the present and unite in one Community Church. I felt I could preach nothing but the Gospel of Grace; that neither Roman Catholicism nor Protestantism could satisfy the needs of these people but a Christian Catholic Church without any other qualification. A purified Church which would present the Gospel to them as did the Primitive Church, and exercise authority according to the spirit of free America.\\" (Bishop Joseph Rene Vilatte, Autobiography, 1910) =Worship= The Mass of the parish church uses patristic, Old Catholic Church of the Netherlands, and Vatican II liturgies. The John Paul II Mass is the most commonly used liturgy in the parish. It is similar to the current Roman Rite Mass except some parts are from the other two Masses. Eucharistic Prayer I combines the Roman Rite of 1985 with the Dutch Rite. The parish did not adapt to the 2011 changes within the Roman Catholic Church. =Sacraments= The Old Catholic Church holds that there are Seven Sacraments of the Church, at least two of which were commissioned by Christ in the Gospels. The Sacraments were instituted as a means of healing and uniting humanity once again to one another and to God. The scourge of humanity is sin, isolation, and despair, the answer is God's healing through grace. In that spirit we encourage all to receive the grace of healing and to be made whole again. =Eucharist= Following the Old Catholic and later Roman Catholic traditions, the vernacular is used during the liturgy with the exception of some Greek, Latin, and Spanish. Old Catholics believe in the doctrine of the Real Presence, that the bread and wine become the body and blood of Christ at the consecration. Communion is distributed under both species. Frequently, the community leaves the pews to gather around the altar for the celebration of the Eucharist. Only an ordained priest with apostolic succession is allowed to consecrate the Eucharist. All baptized Christians are invited to receive the Eucharist regardless of their current state of grace. =Confession= The parish regards a confession of sins to God, followed by the assignment of penance and absolution given by the priest, to be the way the congregation normally obtains forgiveness of sins. The sacrament may be administered in one of two ways: public or private. Adults may avail themselves of private confession if they so wish. The sacrament is always available but not required for the reception of Eucharist. =Birth control= The parish teaches that the use of birth control is a matter of personal judgment for husband and wife, rather than the responsibility of church authorities to instruct its members regarding specific times of procreation. =Pro-Life= The Old Catholic Church holds that human life should be protected from the moment of conception. However, the question of politically how this goal is to be achieved is not determined by church law but by best practices. In the spirit of Catholicism, we hold a seamless garment on life issues from conception to natural death which includes issues of poverty and human dignity. The pro-life stance of the community is not a political stance, but a stance based on the belief of the intrinsic value which all people possess. =Marriage and divorce= The church believes that marriage is the sacrament which unites the married couple and gives them grace to be faithful to each other and to bring up their children in love and devotion to God. The Old Catholic Church permits divorced people to participate fully in the Mass and to receive the Eucharist. The parish follows the Eastern tradition in allowing for a remarriage after a first divorce without an annulment. A third marriage faces a great deal of scrutiny and a fourth is not permissible. =Priesthood and marriage= Since the early 1900s the Old Catholic Church has permitted its clergy to be married, and in practice encourages them to be so. They believe that a married priest will have a better understanding of the marital issues facing his parishioners. The Church also allows women to be ordained, following the tradition of the early church. =Sexuality= The parish largely agrees with the Roman Catholic Catechism on issues of sexuality but disagrees about the claims that the Church has consistently rejected homosexuality in all forms and that Scripture finds the sexual acts \\"gravely depraved.\\" However, the parish affirms that morality and sexuality are deep- seated elements of Christianity and that relativism and subjective morality are rejected. The Old Catholic Church does not make an issue about sexuality, claiming that there are larger social issues on which Christians should be focusing. The Catechism of the Roman Catholic Church on sexuality: CCC 2332 Sexuality affects all aspects of the human person in the unity of his body and soul. It especially concerns affectivity, the capacity to love and to procreate, and in a more general way the aptitude for forming bonds of communion with others. CCC 2357 Homosexuality refers to relations between men or between women who experience an exclusive or predominant sexual attraction toward persons of the same sex. It has taken a great variety of forms through the centuries and in different cultures. Its psychological genesis remains largely unexplained. CCC 2358 The number of men and women who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies is not negligible... They must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided. These persons are called to fulfill God's will in their lives and, if they are Christians, to unite to the sacrifice of the Lord's Cross the difficulties they may encounter from their condition. =Documents= As a primary document, the parish accepts fully the eight articles of the Declaration of Utrecht as well as the 1931 Bonn Agreement. The parish also embraces the authentic truths found within the Vatican II documents, with exception to the statements concerning the infallibility of the Pope and the temporal centrality of the diocese of Rome. =Infallibility= The Old Catholic Church does not accept the infallibility of Rome on matters of faith and morals. The church also rejects the principle of universal jurisdiction of the Bishop of Rome. However, the Old Catholic Church recognizes the primacy of the Pope as first among equals, Bishop of Rome, Vicar of St. Peter, and Patriarch of the West. The Papacy is intended to be a unifying force which unites Christians around the table of the Eucharist. The Old Catholic Church does not reject the papacy as does Protestantism, yet they do not pay total obedience as is expected by practicing Roman Catholics. =Governance= The parish is governed in accordance with its bylaws and parish council documents. Bishops and priests possess the authority to explain and teach the doctrinal position of the Church in matters of faith, morals and discipline. The legislative authority of the Church is vested in the parish council and the Parish Meeting. In financial and administrative matters, the parishioners possess administrative authority. The council members work in cooperation with the pastor. The parish is a member of the Rhode Island State Council of Churches and the Independent Catholic Alliance. Overseers \\"We want to guard against Carforism. Our Church is clean and pure. Every man is a gentleman. [Every woman is a lady.] Every priest, a shepherd of souls. The Church is young and small but it is holy and without spot. The size of the church is less important than the nature and kind of clergy it possesses. We teach and believe all that ancient and historic Catholic Christendom teaches.\\" Bishop Paul Francis Cope 1941 Fr. John, Alice, and Fr. Jakob at the Easter Vigil 2012 =Father Jakob-Lazarus= Graduated with a degree in religious studies and philosophy from Stonehill College, a master's degree in theology from Providence College and also attended the Dominican School of Philosophy and Theology in Berkeley, California. Fr. Jakob is a graduate from the University of Massachusetts School of Law. Since 11 October 2009, Fr. Jakob has acted as the pastor of the parish. Fr. Jakob is currently involved in work with the New England Coalition Against Human Trafficking, the Religious Coalition for Marriage Equality, and the Rhode Island State Council of Churches. He has a particular interest in assisting former convicts and those marginalized by poverty. Fr. Jakob is a recent MBA graduate from Bryant University. =Father John Paul Reardon= Was ordained to the priesthood on January 3, 2004. Fr. John grew up in Scituate, Massachusetts. He holds a B.A. in Political Science from Haverford College, an M.A. in Theology from the University of Notre Dame, and a Master of Divinity for Clergy from the Oblate School of Theology. Fr. John has worked in banking, government, and the non- profit sector. He has extensive teaching and campus ministry experience at the high school and college levels. He has also ministered with the Latino community in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania and The Bronx, New York City. Fr. John has a Masters in Social Work from the Smith College School for Social Work. As part of that degree, he was interning with the Student Counseling Center at Johnson & Wales University where he currently teaches humanities. Fr. John is also graduated with a Ph.D. in Theology at Fordham University and is a Licensed Social Worker. Paraclete Charities Paraclete Charities began in May 2011 with the hope of ministering to the physical, social, and emotional needs of people within Rhode Island. The first step of Paraclete Charities was to purchase a food truck with a legal kitchen which could serve the community. The mobile kitchen could be used both to give away warm meals but also as a means of fund raising at events to support its ministry. The first event the Dough-Nation mobile attended was Providence Pride in 2011. Paraclete Charities is in the process of seeking its own incorporation and 501(c)(3) status as a public charity. Brother Michael Timothy is the current director of the Dough- Nation mobile kitchen. Berkshire Nursing Home Starting in Advent of 2010, the Chapel of the Holy Spirit took on a chaplaincy roll at the Berkshire Place Nursing Home. On a bi-monthly basis, the clergy celebrate Mass and visit with the patients of the nursing home. The residents are active members of celebrating the Mass and lector for the Mass. Both Catholics and Protestants are welcome to participate equally. Anointing of the Sick is also an important ministry at the Berkshire.

Regarded as the most rugged machines Teletype Corporation built, this line of teleprinters used an exchangeable type box for printing and sequential selector \\"Stunt Box\\" to mechanically initiate non-printing functions within the typing unit of the page printer, electrically control functions within the page printer and electrically control external equipment. The Teletype Model 28 is more rugged and more expensive than later Teletype Model 32 machines. The Teletype Corporation introduced the Model 28 as a commercial product in 1953 after being originally designed for the United States military. There are three versions of the Model 28 page printer: * the Model 28 ASR, (Automatic Send and Receive), which has a built in 5-level paper tape reader and tape perforator; * the Model 28 KSR (Keyboard Send and Receive), which lacks the paper tape reader and punch; * the Model 28 RO (Receive Only) which has neither a keyboard nor a paper tape reader/punch. History Teletype Corporation's Model 28 line of communications terminals was first delivered to the US Military in 1951 and commercially introduced in 1953. This series of teleprinters and associated equipment was popular in the various branches of the United States Armed Forces, and commercially in the financial and manufacturing industries. Teletype machines were gradually replaced in new installations by dot-matrix printers and CRT-based terminals in the mid to late 1970s. Basic CRT-based terminals which could only print lines and scroll them are often called glass teletypes to distinguish them from more sophisticated devices. Teletype Corporation discontinued Model 28 production in 1981. =Model 28 ASR vs. ASR-28= While the manufacturer called the Model 28 teleprinter with a tape punch and tape reader a Model 28 ASR, many users, specifically computer users, called this equipment an ASR-28. The earliest known source for this Teletype Corporation equipment naming discrepancy comes from Digital Equipment Corporation documentation where the September 1963 PDP-4 Brochure calls the Teletype Model 28 KSR a \\"KSR-28\\" in the paragraph titled \\"Printer-Keyboard and Control Type 65\\". This naming discrepancy continued from the Teletype Model 28 to other Teletype equipment in later DEC documentation. Technical information The Teletype Corporation Model 28 Line of Equipment The design objective for the Model 28 was a machine that would run at 100 words per minute with less maintenance than that required by a contemporary teletypewriter running at 60 words per minute. Additional design criteria included the requirements to run quieter and be lighter than previous teleprinters. The Model 28 equipment was also designed to successfully operate in a wider range of temperatures and operate in moving vehicles.Zenner, W.J. \\"A New Teletypewriter\\", RTTY Journal, 1953, p. 4. The Model 28 equipment adjustments are made by turning screws and not by bending metal bars and levers as is done in the later Model 32 and Model 33 series of teleprinters. The Model 28 printing unit frame is lighter due to the use of stamped sheet metal instead of cast iron. The Model 28 ASR allowed the user to operate the keyboard to punch tape while transmitting a previously punched tape and to punch a tape while printing an incoming message. One of the design advances in the Model 28 is the use of a compact and lightweight type box. In the Model 15, the moving carriage assembly weighs slightly over five pounds. The carriage assembly in the Model 28 weighs eight ounces. This weight reduction allows for a faster carriage return, necessary for 100 word-per- minute operation. The lighter carriage assembly effectively eliminates the effect of gravity on operation in the air and on the sea where level operation in not practical.Zenner, W.J. \\"A New Teletypewriter\\", RTTY Journal, 1953, p. 6. The type box is easily removed, without tools, for cleaning and there are many type box options. The Teletype Parts Bulletin 1149-B. lists sixteen available Model 28 type box options. Another design advance in the Model 28 was the use of a new all-steel clutch that uses internal expansion to minimize wear and reduce the need for lubrication.Zenner, W.J. \\"A New Teletypewriter\\", RTTY Journal, 1953, p. 7. The Model 28 series was also modular. The keyboard unit, the printing unit, the perforators and the transmitter distributors are self-contained and swappable to aid in troubleshooting and maintenance. The Model 28 printing units contain a sequential selector, known as the Stunt Box, which monitors the received line and the keyboard signals for receipt of single characters and sequences of characters. Forty-two functional control positions are provided, some of which as used for functions such as carriage return, line feed, figures shift, letters shift, unshift-on-space and the signal bell. The removable Electrical Service Unit (LESU) is an integrated chassis housing the line fuse, convenience receptacle, terminal blocks for wiring options and mounting facilities for optional sub-assemblies. The Model 28 is usually geared to run at maximum speed ten characters per second speed, i.e. 100 words per minute (wpm), but other speeds are available. These speeds include 60 wpm, 61 wpm, 65 wpm, 66 wpm, 67 wpm, 71 wpm, 75 wpm, 81 wpm, 88 wpm, 100 wpm, 106 wpm, 107 wpm and 200 wpm (on some paper tape equipment). Teletype Model 28 Line of Equipment Teletype Corporation Model 28 KSR keyboard Model 28 Keyboard Send-Receive Page Printer The Teletype Model 28 KSR, first delivered to the United States Navy in 1951, represented approximately twelve years of research and design. The KSR is composed of a keyboard base (LK) which supports the motor unit (LMU) and the typing unit (LP) and incorporates the code selecting and signal generator mechanisms. The standard Teletype three-row keyboard is expanded on the Model 28 with the addition of special keys, normally colored red, which allow the operator to control keyboard line break, keyboard lock and unlock, repeat operation, and local carriage return and local line feed. The keyboard base, with the attached motor unit and typing unit, is pivotally mounted a cradle within the cabinet and swings outward for maintenance. Unlike previous machines, all mechanical controls, such as the Model 15 manual platen crank, are brought to the front so that machines can be positioned side-by-side in rows. Electrical accessories, such as the line relays, motor relays and power fuses are mounted in a separate removable chassis called the Electrical Service Unit. A separate shelf is available in the console base for ancillary equipment such as rectifiers and is also used to store local installation documentation. The Teletype Model 28 KSR was produced as a floor, table and wall model. The floor model is 40 inches high, 20.5 inches wide and 18.5 inches deep, excluding the keyboard, and weighs 130 pounds. The table model is 16 inches high, 20.5 inches wide and 18.5 inches deep, excluding the keyboard, and weighs 130 pounds. The keyboard extends 4.5 inches. The wall model is 30 inches high, 16.5 inches wide and 14.5 inches deep and weighs 110 pounds. The keyboard extends 4.5 inches. This machine, using the standard synchronous motor, uses less than 1.5 amps at 115VAC 60 Hz. The recommended operating environment is a temperature of 40 to 110 Fahrenheit, a relative humidity of 2 to 95 percent and an altitude of 0 to 10,000 feet. The printing paper is an 8.44 inch by 4.5 inch diameter roll. Ribbons are 0.5 inch wide by 60 yards long with plastic spools and eyelets for proper ribbon reverse operation. Model 28 Automatic Send-Receive Set The Teletype Model 28 ASR, introduced in 1957, was designed and built using existing stand-alone components and packaged as a console. The Model 28 ASR incorporates tape punch and tape reader components in addition to the keyboard, page printer, electrical service unit, console and motor used in the Model 28 KSR. The Model 28 ASR keyboard base (LAK) supports the tape punch in addition to motor unit (LMU), typing unit (LP) and the code selecting and signal generator mechanisms of the Model 28 KSR. The Model 28 ASR tape reader, also known as the transmitter-distributor is mounted separately but powered by the same motor unit that powers the keyboard and typing unit. Four different tape punch units are available for use with the Model 28 ASR. These are the non-typing perforator (LPE), typing perforator (LTPE), non-typing reperforator (LRPE) and typing reperforator (LPR). Similarly, there are four different tape reader options. These are the fixed head single contact transmitter- distributor (LXD), pivoted head multi-contact transmitter-distributor (LAXD), fixed head multi-contact transmitter-distributor (LBXD) and pivoted and fixed head multi-contact transmitter-distributor (LCXD). There is also an option that installs a second tape punch, usually a typing reperforator (LPR) under the dome just behind the tape reader. The second tape punch is driven by its own motor. The Teletype Model 28 ASR is 40 inches high, 36 inches wide and 18.5 inches deep, excluding the keyboard. The keyboard extends 4.5 inches. The Teletype Model 28 ASR weighs 260 pounds. This machine, using the standard synchronous motor, uses less than 1.5 amps at 115VAC 60 Hz. The recommended operating environment is a temperature of 40 to 110 Fahrenheit, a relative humidity of 2 to 95 percent and an altitude of 0 to 10,000 feet. The printing paper is an 8.44 inch by 4.5 inch diameter roll and the paper tape is a one inch by 1000 foot roll. Ribbons are 0.5 inch wide by 60 yards long with plastic spools and eyelets for proper ribbon reverse operation. Model 28 Receive Only Page Printer The Teletype Model 28 RO is composed of a receive- only base (LB) which supports the motor unit and the typing unit (LP) and incorporates the code selecting mechanisms. The Teletype Model 28 RO is 40 inches high, 20.5 inches wide and 18.5 inches deep. The Teletype Corporation Model 28 Receiving Selector Model 28 Receiving Selector The Model 28 Receiving Selector, also known as the LRS, converts incoming serial teletypewriter signals into parallel-wire intelligence. This equipment is capable of operating at 60, 75 or 100 words per minute and operates on a five-level start-stop code, with an option for six-level start-stop code. This unit is equipped with two types of contacts - code reading and timing contacts. The Model 28 Receiving Selector, equipped with a standard 115 VAC 60 Hz synchronous motor, is 8 inches high, 8.5 inches wide and 9.75 inches deep and weighs 16.5 pounds. Model 28 Tape Punch The Model 28 Tape Punches, also known as a tape perforators, are receiving-only five-level devices that is actuated by incoming line signals and perforates standard 11/16 inch paper tape. These tape punches are self-contained and motor-driven, operating at speeds up to 100 words-per-minute. The Model 28 family of tape punches includes the non- typing perforator (LPE), typing perforator (LTPE), non-typing reperforator (LRPE) and typing reperforator (LPR). Model 28 Tape Reader The Model 28 Tape Readers, also known as a transmitter-distributors, are transmitting-only five, six, seven or eight level devices that automatically converts chadless or fully perforated paper tape into electrical impulses. These devices are self- contained and motor-driven and operate at speeds up to 200 words-per-minute. In some equipment, these electrical signals are transmitted sequentially over a single telegraph channel to local or remote receiving stations. In other cases, the tape readers will provide output on a parallel-wire basis. The Model 28 family of tape readers includes the fixed head single contact transmitter-distributor (LXD), pivoted head multi-contact transmitter- distributor (LAXD), fixed head multi-contact transmitter-distributor (LBXD), pivoted and fixed head multi-contact transmitter-distributor (LCXD) and tape reader parallel-wire transmitter (LX). Model 28 Reperforator Transmitter- Distributor Set The Teletype Model 28 RT Set is punched tape message and data relay set that receives, punches, prints, stores, reads and transmits five- level paper tape. The receiving unit accepts incoming electrical signals and punches and prints the intelligence on five-level paper tape. The sending unit reads and translates the taped intelligence into electrical impulses for transmission either cross-office or cross-country. The paper tape readers and punches can be geared at speeds up to 200 words-per-minute. Gears are also available for slower speed operation at 60, 75 or 100 words-per-minute. Optional three-speed gear-shift mechanisms are also available for manual speed change operation at speeds of 60, 75 and 100 words-per-minute. The tape handling unit contains a large capacity tape supply reel capable of storing up to 3000 feet of paper tape, an intermediate tape storage bin that handles approximately 100 feet of paper tape and a tape winder reel that will store 1000 feet of paper tape.

It is a single-engine, low-wing tandem-seat turboprop training aircraft with a metal airframe. The aircraft will be capable of higher basic training functions including aerobatics, instrument, tactical flying and it provides an easy transition to jet trainer at higher training levels. And also will be capable of performing close air support, counter insurgency (COIN), and reconnaissance missions. Kobac is Serbian for sparrowhawk. Development The Kobac will represent a level above the Lasta 95 in basic pilots training. In flight, the Kobac is projected to have a top speed of 310 miles per hour. Although the Kobac is based on the Lasta airframe, there are numerous modifications to suit its new roles. The most obvious is the 750-shp turboprop engine in a lengthened nose. Two engine options will be offered in the production version. The 750 shp Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-25C or the 730 shp Ivchenko-Progress Motor Sich AI-450S. The rear fuselage is lengthened and a new fin has been designed to handle the increased power. Tip tanks add 420 pounds of fuel to the internal load of 344 pounds, raising endurance to approximately five hours. While the Lasta-95 has basic armament capability for weapons training, with two hardpoints for gun pods or light bombs, the Kobac is designed for full combat operations. It has five hardpoints for the carriage of more than 1,100 pounds of stores. All four underwing pylons can carry freefall bombs, seven- or sixteen-tube rocket launchers and gun pods for 0.5-inch or 20-mm weapons. The outer wing pylons can mount air-to-air or air-to-surface missiles, or racks for practice bombs. The centerline hardpoint can carry an electronic warfare pod. UTVA has redesigned the Kobac's cockpit area with a new canopy offering better visibility than the Lasta-95. It has been designed ergonomically to be fully compatible with 90 percent of the pilot population and safe-compatible with 99 percent. The rear seat is raised by approximately four inches to give the back-seater good forward vision. Both positions are fitted with Martin-Baker Mk 15B lightweight ejection seats. A modern three-screen cockpit is installed, with a large central multifunction display for tactical displays and sensor imagery. Control of the system is by HOTAS (hands-on throttle and stick). A navigation and attack system has been devised with sensors mounted in a low- profile pallet under the center fuselage.Politika (Serbian)-April 4, 2012 - Kobac iz domaceg jata Its development was revealed to the public on April 2, 2012 by Serbian Minister of Defense Dragan ≈†utanovac.

For example, the lexicographically minimal rotation of \\"bbaaccaadd\\" would be \\"aaccaaddbb\\". It is possible for a string to have multiple lexicographically minimal rotations, but for most applications this does not matter as the rotations must be equivalent. Finding the lexicographically minimal rotation is useful as a way of normalizing strings. If the strings represent potentially isomorphic structures such as graphs, normalizing in this way allows for simple equality checking. A common implementation trick when dealing with circular strings is to concatenate the string to itself instead of having to perform modular arithmetic on the string indices. Algorithms =The Naive Algorithm= The naive algorithm for finding the lexicographically minimal rotation of a string is to iterate through successive rotations while keeping track of the most lexicographically minimal rotation encountered. If the string is of length , this algorithm runs in time in the worst case. =Booth's Algorithm= An efficient algorithm was proposed by Booth (1980). The algorithm uses a modified preprocessing function from the Knuth-Morris-Pratt string search algorithm. The failure function for the string is computed as normal, but the string is rotated during the computation so some indices must be computed more than once as they wrap around. Once all indices of the failure function have been successfully computed without the string rotating again, the minimal lexicographical rotation is known to be found and its starting index is returned. The correctness of the algorithm is somewhat difficult to understand, but it is easy to implement. def least_rotation(S: str) -> int: \\"\\"\\"Booth's algorithm.\\"\\"\\" S += S # Concatenate string to it self to avoid modular arithmetic f = [-1] * len(S) # Failure function k = 0 # Least rotation of string found so far for j in range(1, len(S)): sj = S[j] i = f[j - k - 1] while i != -1 and sj != S[k + i + 1]: if sj < S[k + i + 1]: k = j - i - 1 i = f[i] if sj != S[k + i + 1]: # if sj != S[k+i+1], then i  -1 if sj < S[k]: # k+i+1 = k k = j f[j - k] = -1 else: f[j - k] = i + 1 return k Of interest is that removing all lines of code which modify the value of results in the original Knuth-Morris-Pratt preprocessing function, as (representing the rotation) will remain zero. Booth's algorithm runs in time, where is the length of the string. The algorithm performs at most comparisons in the worst case, and requires auxiliary memory of length to hold the failure function table. =Shiloach's Fast Canonization Algorithm= Shiloach (1981) proposed an algorithm improving on Booth's result in terms of performance. It was observed that if there are q equivalent lexicographically minimal rotations of a string of length n, then the string must consist of q equal substrings of length d=n/q. The algorithm requires only n + d/2 comparisons and constant space in the worst case. The algorithm is divided into two phases. The first phase is a quick sieve which rules out indices that are obviously not starting locations for the lexicographically minimal rotation. The second phase then finds the lexicographically minimal rotation start index from the indices which remain. =Duval's Lyndon Factorization Algorithm= Duval (1983) proposed an efficient algorithm involving the factorization of the string into its component Lyndon words, which runs in linear time with a constant memory requirement. Variants Shiloach (1979) proposed an algorithm to efficiently compare two circular strings for equality without a normalization requirement. An additional application which arises from the algorithm is the fast generation of certain chemical structures without repetitions.

He emigrated to Indianapolis in December 1897 to help complete the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument in Indianapolis, Indiana, which was designed by German architect Bruno Schmitz.William L. Selm, Soldiers and Sailors Monument, The Encyclopedia of Indianapolis by David J. Bodenhamer and Robert Graham Barrows, Indiana University Press, 1994. Pages 1278-1279 He was invited to work on the project by Karl Bitter, with whom he had worked in Austria. Training In Vienna, Schwarz attended the Real-Schule, similar to America's high school, for eight years. Afterward, he entered the Imperial Academy of Arts in Vienna, where his work was recognized and where he received many prizes. Karl Bitter met him at that Academy and introduced him to stone-carving. Bitter describes Schwarz in their younger days: \\"Schwarz attracted me very much. His manly bearing, his fondness for athletic exercise, his straightforwardness, and particularly his quick and vivid mind, made him one of the most promising pupils of the Academy. To his influence during these years I owe a great deal, especially in physical development. He supplied our class with dumbbells, which became our favorite exercise. He was the kind of young man in every respect that I should like my son to be; for with his coming a new ideal, striving, entered the hearts of the other students.\\", whom he had known in Austria. In 1887 when the competition for the Soldiers and Sailors Monument began, Bruno Schmitz, who was first commissioned for the work realized he needed to bring Schwarz to Indianapolis. Schmitz located him in the ateliers of Berlin and both went to Indianapolis to work on the monument. Indianapolis years He lived a simple life, almost secluded, and was not known among the public. He created a studio on East Raymond Street on the south side of Indianapolis. His studio was more or less a shed that was below ground. He had an assistant who was also his model who would dress in costumes for the figures that Schwarz would be designing. Schwarz made his creations using the lost wax casting process. About working as an artist, Schwarz says: \\"It requies some nerve for a young man to choose art as a career. An artist sometimes does not know how to meet the problems that come up. He must have the greatest conceivable amount of patience if he wishes to achieve success. Art as well as any other work takes perseverance.\\", For the last seven years of his life, Schwarz created and directed a class in sculpture from 1905 to 1912 at the John Herron Art School, now known as Herron School of Art and Design. Rudolf Schwarz died on April 14, 1912 at the age of forty-seven.Sister M.

Rabel studied under Richard Wettstein at the University of Vienna, studying plants. She went on to do experimental work on the color adaptation of certain low plants to their surroundings. Eventually moving on to studying theoretical physics in Leipzig and in Berlin with Albert Einstein and Max Planck, getting her P.hD. in physics for a thesis entitled \\"The Intensity of Certain Lines of the H-Spectrum as Dependent on Gas Pressure\\". In 1923, she was diagnosed with manic depression and lived in a sanatorium for two years where she started studying philosophy, working with Hermann Keyserling and Rudolf Steiner. After becoming intrigued by philology, she conducted research at the Goethe Archives in Weimar. There, in 1927, she published Goethe und Kant and books about Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Immanuel Kant. In 1932, she became a regular contributor to Science Service while still working as a scientist in Germany. As a contributor, she wrote summaries of topics ranging from paleontology to syphilis, continental drift to psychotherapy and poetry. In May 1940, Rabel moved to England to avoid the economic and political situation developing in Germany prior to World War II. She lived in the United States for four years lecturing.

When playing for West Adelaide, Luders wore number 29. As of 2014, Luders remains the all-time leading goal kicker for West Adelaide having kicked 558 during his career, almost 200 in front of second placed Adam Richardson who played for the Bloods between 1997 and 2002. Career After coming through West Adelaide's junior ranks Roger Luders made his league debut with West Adelaide late in the 1978 SANFL season under Fos Williams in what would be Williams's final season of coaching league football. Luders played two games in 1978, kicking four goals. Luders, who played at full forward, quickly became known as one of the best 'high fliers' in South Australian football. Long time SANFL television commentator Ian Day (brother of West Adelaide Hall of Fame member Robert Day) stated during the telecast of West's last minor round game for 1983 against West Torrens at Football Park after he had taken one of his signature high marks that Luders would be worth his place in the West Adelaide side just for his spectacular high marking ability. During his time at West, Luders became one of the most popular players at the club, especially with its fans. Luders was The Bloods' leading goalkicker from 1979 until 1984 with his supreme year coming in 1983 when he became the first West Adelaide player to ever kick over 100 goals in a season. He kicked 94 in 22 regular season games and with his 6th goal he kicked his historic 100th for the season in a 74 point win over reigning premiers in the Second Semi-final at Football Park. Two weeks later Luders kicked four goals in West Adelaide's 21.16 (142) to 16.12 (108) win over Sturt in the SANFL Grand Final to finish with 105 for the season, still the club record as of 2019. In front of 47,129 fans at Football Park, it was West Adelaide's first premiership since 1961 (both premierships were under the coaching of Neil Kerley). During the early 1980s, Luders regularly vied with other champion full forwards in the SANFL at the time such as Tim Evans (Port Adelaide), Rick Davies (Sturt), Grenville Dietrich (North Adelaide) and Neville Roberts (Norwood) for the Ken Farmer Medal, awarded annually to the SANFL's leading goal kicker. Although he continually led West Adelaide from the goal front, the award would elude Luders during his career. In his best goal kicking year in 1983 when he kicked 105 for the season, Dietrich (109), Roberts (111) and Davies, who kicked a then Australian record 151, kicked more goals. In Round 17 of the 1985 season in a game at Wests home ground of Richmond Oval, Luders had his jaw broken in two places after a clash with North Adelaide's Stephen Riley. Luders had taken a mark about 30 metres out from goal at the grounds southern end when Riley jumped at him late with a raised elbow. Luders, who had kicked 52 goals for the season until that point would spend 48 hours in hospital in intensive care and was forced to miss the rest of the season. including West's return to the finals where they eventually finished third (a spate of injuries had seen West Adelaide had only finished sixth in their premiership defence in 1984). The incident prompted West General Manager Doug Thomas to call for Riley to be de- registered from the SANFL, claiming it would be grossly unfair that Riley get to continue playing the season for North while West would be without the services of their champion full forward until the 1986 season (North Adelaide would defeat West in the 1985 Preliminary final, the Grand Final qualifier, with Riley as part of their team). Luders returned to league football in 1986, kicking just 35 goals in 17 games. After only kicking 38 goals in 1987, Luders retired from SANFL football at the end of the year having played 165 games for West Adelaide over 10 seasons, with fans and media commentators noting that he was not the same player after returning from his broken jaw. His tally of 558 goals remains the West Adelaide club record and set him as the 14th all-time leading goalkickers in the SANFL with a career average of 3.37 goals per game. Roger Luders was awarded Player Life Membership with West Adelaide in 1984 after playing his 100th game for the club in Wests 34.17 (221) to 19.14 (128) win over Woodville at Football Park in Round 20 of the 1983 season. Personal In 2005 Luders was an inaugural inductee into the West Adelaide Football Club Hall of Fame Luders became an assistant coach of West Adelaide in 2009 and is the father of West Adelaide player Scott Luders.

The Red Lick Presbyterian church, also known as the \\"Brick Church\\", was erected in 1845, and is still standing. A historic plaque is located there. The Natchez, Jackson and Columbus Railroad was completed in 1882, and a station was located in Red Lick. Known as \\"The Little J\\", the line ran between Jackson and Natchez, and had various owners, including the Illinois Central Railroad, who abandoned the line between 1979 and 1981. In 1900, Red Lick had a population of 70. By 1907, the settlement had three churches and a money order post office. In 1950, Red Lick had two stores, two churches, and two sawmills located near the railroad track. The United Vocational High School was located in Red Lick, and closed in 1958.

These earthworks were created as a dedication to the Sun God and Earth Mother, and the mounds were used as gathering places for religious ceremonies as well as viewing astronomical alignments. The Great Mound is the largest of the ten earthworks in the Mounds State Park, and its construction dates back between 250 and 160 B.C. The three floors of the Great Mound were created by a repeated process that included adding a layer of subsoil, burning the ground, then covering the floor in a layer of powdered white calcite, made from bone, shell, and limestone. This gave the floor a clay consistency as well as deep purple color. Each floor had basins and pits of unknown purposes, however near the gateway of the mound platform, a large pit was found containing various artifacts. These artifacts included chipped stone, flakes, burned bone, a fragment of shell, fragments of mica, and burned clay chunks. Built above this pit was a log tomb, called so because the floor of the tomb was laid with logs. When excavated, two human burials were found inside the tomb; a 50-year- old adult male, and the redeposited partial remains of a cremated individual. Also, artifacts such as a limestone platform pipe, flakes, fire-cracked rocks, mica fragments, pottery, burned and unburned bone, and seven deer bone awls were found in the tomb. 100 years after the mound was started, the construction of the Great Mound's platform was started. Although the embankment appears random and irregular, it was actually carefully crafted. The only other aboriginal features on the platform were numerous small post holes encircling the top. These holes most likely held a brush fence erected to hide activities carried out on the platform. After the mound was completed, several more pits were dug, some of them spanning from the surface to the lowest floor. One pit was possibly looted, while two other pits contained human burials. No other artifacts were found in these pits. One issue archaeologist faced when working at the Anderson mounds was the maps that had been used since the late 1800s; appearing to be accurate, but research showed that the earthworks had been misrepresented in the map. This issue is significant since it affects the context of the site. Archaeological surveys of the park have shown that people have used the land for about 10,000 years, beginning back as early as 8000 B.C. and continuing through about 1400 AD. Considering how many years this site has been used, the condition of the earthworks that were discovered is stunning. The earthworks are in pristine condition, although now due to the state park, they are facing a greater challenge to continue keep them in that condition. One of the most known styles is the circular earthwork. There are believed to be 8 in the park, but only 4 are visible today. Another defining feature is the \\"great mound\\" this mound is long, wide, and deep. This feature is the most prominent mound in the park, and is so large that another mound appears to be visible, however, this is known as the \\"small knoll\\". This was used for rituals and has been targeted by looters in the past, which caused significant damage to the artifacts. These rituals, as estimated by radiocarbon dating, began around 250 B.C. Another feature of this site is the fiddle-back enclosure. Even though there have not been any observed astronomical activities here, it does mark the spot where the sun sets on the summer solstice.

She wrote under the pseudonym of Marius Stein. Life Born the illegitimate child of a military officer, she was raised by her mother Anna T√∂lk in impoverished circumstances and educated in a Hungarian convent school. When she was 19, she moved with her mother to Graz where she published her first articles as a journalist under the pseudonym Marius Stein. The newspapers Moderne Dichtung and Wiener Rundschau numbered among her employers. At age 23 she married Hubert Janitschek, a professor of art history. The couple lived in Strassburg and Leipzig. Her husband died in 1893 and Maria moved to Berlin and later to Munich. Work Her first published books were collections of poetry and short stories. These appealed to the interests of the bourgeois women's movement in the topics of their works: the problems of marriage and love for women, treated in a manner that at the time was very liberal. In 1889 she published her first volume of poems Irdische und unirdische Tr√§ume (Earthly and Unearthly Dreams), which included the highly criticized poem \\"Ein modernes Weib\\" (A Modern Wife). Germany banned her short story collection Die neue Eva in 1909. She considered √âmile Zola, Henrik Ibsen, and Leo Tolstoy to be her role models. Her works often have strong female characters who become merciless avengers when wrongs are done to them. In her epic works, she explored the dualism between the sensible and the emotional side of people.

Later in the year, Meng Tian succeeded in defeating the Xiongnu, driving them from the Ordos and seizing their homeland.. After the catastrophic defeat at the hands of Meng Tian, the Xiongnu leader Touman was forced to flee far north into the Mongolian Plateau.. As a result of the northward expansion, the threat that the Qin empire posed to the Xiongnu ultimately led to the reorganisation of the many different Xiongnu tribes united into a confederacy against the unified Chinese state.. Aftermath Following the victory against the nomads, Meng Tian was instructed to secure the frontier with a line of fortifications, which would become known as the Great Wall of China.. Crown Prince Fusu and General Meng Tian were stationed at a garrison in Suide and soon began with the construction of the walled defenses, which would be connected with the old walls from the Qin, Yan, and Zhao states.. The Qin walls ran from Liaodong to Lintao, thus enclosing the conquered Ordos region. However, the garrison was abandoned from the civil war after the death of Qin Shi Huang leading the dynasty's collapse. The chaos of the interregnum Chu‚ÄìHan Contention allowed the Xiongnu under Modu Chanyu to recapture the territory that they had previously lost to the Chinese and to conquer and subjugated other nomadic tribe such as the Yuezhi and Donghu.

Plot Rebecca Duvall (Uma Thurman) is stuck in Cuba, which leads to some potential financial backers giving Eileen (Anjelica Huston) only two days to get Duvall if she wants their money, and Derek (Jack Davenport) to have Karen (Katharine McPhee) be the Marilyn understudy in the meantime so that staging can continue. Dev (Raza Jaffrey) doesn't get the promotion to press secretary he was hoping for, but instead of telling Karen, he turns to R.J. (Tala Ashe) for comfort. Derek is rough on Karen when she makes an amateur mistake, but when Ivy later points out that it's more productive to coddle the lead than yell, Derek takes note. Karen lets it slip to Dev that Derek sexually harassed her when she first auditioned for Marilyn, and Dev becomes jealous starts a fight over her not telling him. Later, when Karen criticizes a line at rehearsal, Derek starts visualizing her as Marilyn. Derek shows up at Karen's apartment that night to congratulate her on such a good job, and apologize for sexually harassing her when they first met. When Derek leaves, he runs into Dev, and the two get into a fistfight. Dev tells Karen he doesn't want her to ever see Derek anymore. Karen sings \\"Never Give All the Heart\\" at rehearsal the next day, mesmerizing everyone, but Rebecca Duvall shows up moments later. Nick (Thorsten Kaye) introduces Eileen to Randy Cobra (Terrance Mann), a friend of his. Randy becomes the new investor for the show, and Nick and Eileen's relationship heats up. Ivy (Megan Hilty) has a hard time getting a job after her previous drugged performance in the ensemble of 'Heaven on Earth', so she decides to play nice with everyone, including Karen, in hopes of getting back into the show. Julia (Debra Messing) and Tom (Christian Borle) celebrate their anniversary by going to a production of the first play they wrote together. When Tom makes a speech in front of the audience about how grateful he is for Julia, she walks out of the theater. Later, in the parking lot, Julia breaks down and tells Tom that Frank left her and is refusing to talk to her. John (Neal Bledsoe) realizes that Tom has feelings for Sam (Leslie Odom, Jr.), and breaks the relationship off. Production Uma Thurman was first announced to appear on Smash on December 8, 2011. The press release stated that she would appear in a story arc spanning five episodes as a movie star interested in the role of Marilyn Monroe. Terrence Mann also guest-starred in the episode, as an aging burned-out rock star who becomes a major investor in \\"Bombshell\\". The episode includes Katharine McPhee's version of \\"Never Give All the Heart\\", which was first sung by Megan Hilty in the pilot. It also included \\"Don't Say Yes Until I Finish Talking\\", a song meant for Darryl F. Zanuck, which Christian Borle sings as Tom Levitt when the actor playing Zanuck does not show up. During this episode Megan Hilty's character Ivy Lynn is seen walking down W 43rd Street with a view of Hotel Carter and gentleman's club Cheetah's New York in the background.

She was the wife of the Anglo- American actor William Faversham, whom she married shortly after the two co-starred in the 1902 Broadway production, The Royal Rival. Biography Julie (sometimes spelled Julia) Opp was born in New York City on January 28, 1871,Who‚Äôs Who in Music and Drama; Harry Prescott Hanaford, Dixie Hines ‚Äì 1914; pg. 241; Free Google Books the daughter of John \\"Johnny\\" and Mary Opp. Johnny Opp, the son of Bavarian immigrants, ran a saloon on Lower Manhattan's Bowery and was also active in local neighborhood politics. Mary Dwyer, a first generation Irish-American, was some thirteen years her husband's junior and in her late teens when Julie was born. As a child Opp attended public school for a time before her mother decided it best she was educated at a local convent. There she astounded the sisters and amused a bishop by declaring her ambition to become a ballet dancer when he asked what she wanted to be when she grew up. By the time of her graduation journalism had replaced ballet and with the help of a friend she became a fashion writer for the New York Recorder.\\"Julie Opp, Actress, Dies After Operation\\", The New York Times; April 9, 1921; p. 10Theatre Magazine, Vol. 33; June, 1921; p. 452; Google Books Her work as a journalist eventually brought Opp within close orbit of many in the theater world and some, including Sarah Bernhardt and Emma Calv√©, tried to convince her to become an actress. She later played a minor role in a one-off performance of Camille and on occasions did dramatic readings at social affairs, but when playwright George Du Maurier offered her a role in Trilby she turned him down, still not ready to abandon her chosen profession. It was the wife of British actor George Alexander who in 1896 finally convinced Opp to take to the boards with Alexander's company playing Hymen in Shakespeare's As You Like It at London's St. James's Theatre. Of her performance, the London publication To-Day wrote: > Tall and queenly, she is not of the languid or soulless type; she charms you > with a versatility ripened by a successful literary career, and she never > fails to give you proof that she is equipped for the performance of > brilliant work, either on the press or stage.To-Day, December 5, 1896; > pg.133 Julie Opp The American Stage of To-Day, 1910 Julie Opp later replaced Julia Neilson as Rosalind after the actress' departure from As You like it and a few months afterwards assumed the lead role Princess Pannonia in Pinero's The Princess and the Butterfly when Neilson retired from that production. The following year Julie Opp married British actor Robert Loraine (November 7, 1897) and sailed to America where on November 23, she made her New York debut at the Lyceum Theater reprising her role in a Daniel Frohman production of The Princess and the Butterfly and the following year as Belle in R. C. Carton's The Tree of Knowledge. She returned to England in 1900 to perform with Alexander's company for several seasons in productions of Anthony Hope's Rupert of Hentzau, playing Holf; Hope's The Prisoner of Zenda, as Antoinette de Mauban; Walter Frith's The Man of Forty, as Mrs. Egerton; Pearl Craigie's The Wisdom of the Wise, in the role of Annabel East; Charles Haddon Chambers' The Awakening, playing Mrs. Herbertson; and Henry V. Esmond's The Wilderness, taking the part of Edith Thorold. Opp return to New York in 1902 to play opposite William Faversham in The Royal Rival, an adaptation of Jules Massenet's Don Caesar de Kazan by Gerald du Maurier in which she assumed the role of Marlta. \\"Jules Emile Frederic Massenet\\", Famous Composers and Their Works, Volume 2, Part 1, edited by John Knowles Paine, Theodore Thomas, Karl Klauser 1891; p. 711; Free Google Book In 1902 she received a divorce from Loraine and on December 29 of that year married William Faversham, a British actor who would go on to have a long career in America.

He is portrayed by the actor Javier Bardem. A former MI6 agent, he turns to cyberterrorism and begins targeting the agency he used to work for as part of a plan to get revenge against M, against whom he holds a homicidal grudge. Bardem received critical acclaim for his performance, and Silva is regularly ranked among the greatest villains in the James Bond series. Backstory Skyfall establishes that Silva's real name is Tiago Rodriguez, and that he once was a part of Station H, the MI6 division based in Hong Kong before China took control, specialising in cyberterrorism. When he ignored his orders and hacked into the Chinese government's top secret files, M, who was the head of Station H at the time, allowed them to take him prisoner in exchange for the return of six previously captured agents and a peaceful transition of sovereignty. He was tortured for five months, until finally he attempted suicide by swallowing a cyanide capsule. He survived, but was left disfigured with a misshapen jaw, rotted teeth and a sunken left eye socket. He wears a dental prosthetic to conceal his disfigurements. At some point he escaped from Chinese custody and reinvented himself as Raoul Silva, a cyberterrorist for hire, becoming a high ranking member of Spectre, and began forming a plan to get revenge against M. Skyfall One of Silva's henchmen, Patrice, steals a hard drive containing the names and locations of MI6 agents operating undercover within terrorist groups; Silva begins uploading their identities and aliases onto YouTube, resulting in several agents being murdered. Silva then targets MI6 headquarters by sabotaging the building's gas main, causing an explosion that kills several agents. M sends Bond to Shanghai to find and kill Silva. Bond seduces Silva's lover, a prostitute named S√©v√©rine, who promises to take Bond to him in return for her freedom; ultimately, however, Silva intimidates her into betraying Bond. Upon taking Bond captive, Silva forces him at gunpoint to participate in a game of William Tell, in which the target is a shot glass of scotch balanced on Sev√©rine's head. When Bond intentionally misses her, Silva shoots her dead. Bond then kills Silva's men. Moments later, RAF helicopters arrive to take Silva into custody, having been signaled by an emergency distress radio given to Bond by Q. At MI6's underground headquarters in London, M confronts Silva, who taunts her that his plan is already in motion. Q attempts to decrypt Silva's laptop, but inadvertently gives it access to the MI6 systems, allowing Silva to escape from MI6 custody. Q realizes that Silva wanted to be captured as part of a plan to kill M. Silva flees into the London Underground, with Bond in pursuit. Silva diverts through London's sewers. When Bond finally catches up to him, Silva detonates an explosive charge that sends a runaway underground train coming straight for Bond, who narrowly escapes. Silva, along with several accomplices, barge into a government hearing where M is giving a deposition, but fails to kill her. Bond barges in and a gunfight follows, in which Silva's plans are disrupted and Bond manages to flee, taking M with him. Silva follows Bond and M to \\"Skyfall\\", Bond's childhood home in Scotland, where his men open fire. He pursues a mortally wounded M to a chapel at the side of the house, and begs her to kill them both by firing a bullet through her head and into his. At that moment, however, Bond appears and throws a knife into Silva's back, killing him. In other films In the following Bond film, Spectre, Ernst Stavro Blofeld reveals that Silva had worked with and been supported by Spectre, a worldwide criminal organization, along with Le Chiffre and Dominic Greene, the villains of Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace, respectively. Sexuality The scene in which Silva and Bond first met raised eyebrows among critics and fans alike for its supposed homoerotic subtext. In the scene Silva strokes Bond's thighs and chest while interrogating the secret agent, who is tied to a chair. The scene ignited speculation that screenwriter John Logan, who is gay, intended to imply that Silva is gay or bisexual. Logan denied this in an interview with The Huffington Post, saying, \\"Some people claim it's because I'm, in fact, gay but not true at all. [Director Sam Mendes] and I were discussing, there were so many scenes in which Bond goes mano-a-mano with the villain, whether it's Dr. No or Goldfinger or whatever, and there's been so many ways to a cat-and-mouse and intimidate Bond, and we thought, what would make the audience truly uncomfortable is sexual intimidation; playing the homoerotic card that is sort of always there subtextually with characters like Scaramanga in 'Man With the Golden Gun' or Dr. No. So we just decided we would play the card and enjoy it.\\" References Category:Bond villains Category:Film characters introduced in 2012 Category:Fictional characters with disfigurements Category:Fictional attempted suicides Category:Fictional hackers Category:Fictional mass murderers Category:Fictional secret agents and spies Category:Skyfall Category:Fictional terrorists Category:Male film villains Category:Action film villains ","title":"Raoul Silva"},{"id":"35403635","text":"HDMS Sehested (P 547) was a Willemoes-class fast attack craft of the Royal Danish Navy which was in commission from 1978 until 2000. It is now docked at Holmen in Copenhagen where it serves as a museum ship, part of the Royal Danish Naval Museum. The ship is named after Christen Thomesen Sehested, a Danish vice-admiral during The Great Northern War (1709-1721). Ship history The Willemoes were a Danish-manufactured class of fast attack craft built for the naval defence of Denmark during the Cold War. The eighth of ten ships of her class, Sehested was built at Frederikshavn Shipyard. The 46-metre 264-tonne ship was laid down 22 December 1976, launched on 5 May 1977 and commissioned into the Royal Danish Navy on 19 May 1978. She was armed with a 76 mm autocannon on the foredeck, flanked by two torpedo tubes. Six rocket launchers were fitted to the superstructure, and there were eight Harpoon anti-ship missile launchers at the stern. The ship also carried sixteen mines, two Stinger surface-to-air missiles and Seagnat chaff launchers. 16 mines could only be fitted if the two 21in torpedo tubes were removed and replaced by mine holders. If the torpedo tubes were in place, the mine capacity was limited to four mines. If the four mine holders were removed, two additional 21 in torpedo tubes could be mounted, these tubes came preloaded, from the onshore arsenal, and could only be reloaded by dismounting them again. If four torpedo tubes were fitted, none of the tubes could be reloaded at a tender, aft tubes had to be dismounted. The vessel was powered by three Rolls-Royce Proteus gas turbine engines on the three shafts, while there were two GM 8V71 diesel engines on the outer two shafts only to provide low speed manoeuvrability. In 1999 P547 Sehested, achieved a top speed of 42.5 knots, which were the highest recorded and documented speed, for the Willmoes Cl. ever achieved. The sharks teeth painted on the ship, were allowed by the squadron commander early 2000, due to the fate of the ship, the sister vessel P546 Rodsten, had crying eyes painted. In 2000, P546 Rodsten won the Cannonball pennant, during the race from Kiel to Korsoer Naval base, with P547 Sehested, thus being the last holder of the champion title. In the 2000 Danish Defense Agreement () it was decided to phase out the Willemoes class, and Sehested was decommissioned on 31 December 2000. She was handed over to the Royal Danish Naval Museum and docked at the historic Holmen Naval Base in Copenhagen to serve as a museum ship.

Vocalist Rob Halford's performance is considered one of his finest ever, and the guitar work is noted as well, especially the solos. Many reviewers have called it one of the best songs on the album. The song is considered a Judas Priest classic, with versions of the song appearing on the albums Priest, Live and Rare, 98 Live Meltdown, Live in London, A Touch of Evil: Live, Live Insurrection and many of the group's compilation albums. Drummer Les Binks has his only songwriting credit with the band for the song's main riff. Composition The song starts out as a slow and light ballad until the chorus, where the song erupts into heavy riffs. The song then turns light once again until the next chorus, and the following bridge section. The first guitar solo is then played by Glenn Tipton. Then the song turns light once again for the next verses, which is followed by the heavy chorus/bridge section once again and the second guitar solo played by K. K. Downing. This is followed by the final heavy riffs and the epic final scream of Rob Halford. The song describes a man who suffers from depression and enters into a pseudo-catatonic state, which gives the outward appearance of a comatose state, in that it essentially renders the body physically immobile whilst leaving inner thought processes intact in an almost 'locked-in' fashion. He eventually dies, possibly by his own hand due to the state he was essentially locked in, so he is once more released from the chains of life. Furthermore, other lines in the song suggest an anti- suicidal message. The song was mentioned in a 1990 trial in which the parents of two teens who had committed suicide after listening to Stained Class alleged that subliminal messages encouraging suicide had been hidden in another song on the album. In a telephone interview with The New York Times at the time, Halford confirmed that the song carries an anti-suicidal message, discussing how people suffering from depression withdraw from society and refuse to communicate.

His life was, at times, extremely difficult and filled with various hardships due to his career as a gold prospector in the 1850s. Throughout most of his adult life Hinde kept detailed diaries on his daily activities. After his death, his son, Harry Hinde, donated the diaries to the California State Library. The diaries have provided a wealth of information on a variety of topics, in particular on the California Gold Rush. Early years Edmund C. Hinde was the son of Thomas S. Hinde and he was born in Urbana, Champaign County, Ohio on April 6, 1830. Thomas S. Hinde had been a very prominent newspaper publisher, real estate developer, and Methodist minister. The Hinde family was well known in Ohio, Kentucky, and Illinois.Descriptive list of manuscript collections of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin:together with reports on other collections of manuscript material for American history in adjacent states (Google eBook)The Society, 1906 - Reference - 197 pages Like his other brothers and sisters Edmund grew up in Mount Carmel, Illinois. Edmund's father and mother died early and he and his brothers and sisters were forced to either live with other family or fend for themselves. Edmund and his other siblings lived with their older sister Martha and her husband Judge Charles H. Constable during the 1850s. After the death of his parents Edmund was briefly responsible for caring for his younger sister. Once he found suitable accommodations for his sister Edmund left Mount Carmel and took on a variety of menial jobs. He eventually left to mine for gold in California.\\"1883 History of Edwards, Lawrence and Wabash Counties, Illinois\\" California gold mining In 1850 Hinde began his trip to California to look for gold. The trip was harsh and Hinde met with many difficulties on the way to California. Eventually, Edmund and the other prospectors who traveled with him made it to California and they had limited success in mining gold. However, the experience was so challenging that Hinde only stayed a short time gold mining before returning to the Midwest. In his journal Hinde stated that he was swindled out of a large amount of money when he tried to sell the gold he mined upon his return.Hinde, Edmund \\"Journal of Edmund Cavileer Hinde\\" Edited by Jerome Peltier (Ye Galleon Press Fairfield Washington), 1983 Later years Following Hinde's time prospecting gold during the California Gold Rush he went to Canada for a number of years. It was reported in his obituary that while in Canada he was connected with Fort Edmonton. After his time in Canada Hinde returned to various locations in Illinois. Eventually he settled in his hometown of Mount Carmel and was involved in the grain business for the remainder of his life. Four years before Hinde died he moved to Riverside, California and stayed with his son Harry Hinde.

After helping launch the festival, Baxter then started a screenplay competition for new writers. He then guided Slamdance into a year-round support system for emerging artists with national theatrical exhibition of independent film and a film distribution venture called Slamdance Presents. Speaking about the organization Baxter has said \\"Slamdance is an ongoing experiment that has proven year after year really that when it comes to recognizing talent and launching careers, the independent and grass-roots film communities can really do it themselves.\\" In January, 2019 Baxter summed up Slamance's 25th anniversary by saying \\"Slamdance has created a community of emerging and established filmmakers over the past 25 years. The goal is for experienced filmmakers to nurture and help new filmmakers build sustainable careers.\\" = Film Work = Baxter's film work includes Wild In The Streets, a documentary feature about an ancient football game and I Want To Be an American, an experimental feature film based on the surrealist parlor game Exquisite Corpse and DIY, a documentary about the do-it-yourself filmmaking movement.

Bernas is an online-only newspaper, formerly a daily newspaper, based in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. It is one of the early newspapers founded since Indonesia independence. History Bernas was founded on 15 September 1946 as Harian Umum Nasional by Soemanang Soerjowinoto. Its original editorial board consisted of Soemanang, Mashoed Hardjokoesoemo, Bob Maemun, Marbangoen, Mohammad Soepadi, Darsyaf Rahman, and RM Soetio. At the time, Yogyakarta was the temporary capital of the newly independent country. During the entirety of the Indonesian National Revolution, the paper consisted of only two or four pages, printed on whatever paper was available at the time. After the war, Bernas continued to publish. On 26 March 1965, Decree of the Information Minister Number 29/SK/M/65 was passed. This required all newspapers to ally themselves with a political party. Harian Umum Nasional, which allied itself with the Indonesian National Party, changed its name to Suluh Indonesia, becoming an extension of a Jakarta-based newspaper of the same name. When the office in Jakarta changed its name to Suluh Marhaen, the Yogyakarta branch followed suit. By this time the paper had expanded to eight pages daily. In 1969, after the failed 30 September Movement of 1965 and resulting killings led to the fall of President Sukarno, the Ministry of Information rescinded the 1965 order. Once again independent, the Yogyakarta branch of Suluh Marhaen renamed itself Berita Nasional (National News), which was abbreviated Bernas (Bernas itself also means \\"firm\\"). On 13 August 1990, Bernas was acquired by the Kompas Gramedia Group. This was followed by another rename, in which Bernas became the official name of the paper. By the 1990s, they had a circulation of 64,500, each edition had 12 pages. At one of its heights, it has the second-largest circulation of the Yogyakarta Special Region area, after Kedaulatan Rakyat. In 1996, Bernas reporter Fuad Muhammad Syafruddin, better known as \\"Udin\\", published a series of articles exposing corruption in the local government of the Bantul Regency. He was severely beaten on 13 August of that year by two men who were never caught, and died three days later without regaining consciousness. Due to the widespread suspicion that local government officials played a role in a death, his case became a national cause c√©l√®bre. A team of Bernas journalists‚Äîknown as the \\"White Kijang\\" team for the type of car they drove‚Äîlaunched its own investigation of the case, locating witnesses to help clear a driver who had allegedly been bribed by police to make a false confession in the case. Udin's murder was not yet solved to this day. On 29 August 2004, Bernas changed its name to Bernas Jogja, switched to a seven- column format from the previous nine. it has a circulation of 30,500, most of which is in the city proper and Sleman. Eighty-five percent of its readership is male. The name change only reverted to Bernas on 20 May 2015 when property developer company Hebat Group took the majority share of the newspaper. On 1 March 2018, after 71 years of existence, the newspaper ceased physical circulation after published its final edition a day before due to declining readership and ad revenues coupled with increasing costs, though it maintained a digital version.

It is Nr. 14 in the composer's catalogue of works, and has a variable performing length that depends on the version worked out from the given materials. The score is dedicated to Mary Bauermeister. History Plus-Minus is a \\"polyvalent process composition\\" , designed as a project for the composition students attending the first Cologne Courses for New Music, held at the in October to December 1963. In it, various compositional premises of Stockhausen's are presented in such a way as to enable the most radically different concrete results . Plus-Minus was composed in September 1963 while Stockhausen was in Siculiana, preparing for what proved to be an aborted performance of Momente at the Palermo Festival (; ): > In 1963 I spent a couple of weeks in Sicily by the seashore, and as I > couldn't take a lot of paper with me I tried to hide in the shadow of a rock > and think clearly about a new piece, and Plus-Minus is what emerged. (I'd > discussed all the possible transformations of the seven 'musical types' that > occur in the score with Mary [Bauermeister], and we drew them in the sand > together. The piece represents an extreme instance of the new, open type of composition Stockhausen was developing at the time, and evolved from a number of conversations with Mary Bauermeister in Siculiana and Palermo (; ). Stockhausen's intention was to enable a music that reproduces itself, within a strict framework. Twenty-five different versions were made by the students in 1963, for a wide variety of forces: one for four harps, one for three harps and two pianos, one for recorders and children's choir, one for large orchestra, one for percussion and piano, one for two percussionists, and another for choir and chamber orchestra (; ). The first public performance was given in Rome in June 1964 by Cornelius Cardew and Frederic Rzewski, each of whom realised one page of the score . When Stockhausen heard a tape of this performance, he was astonished that sounds he had usually avoided were being employed, exactly according to the score's specifications, to achieve a highly poetic quality . Analysis The course of the work is based on polarities of attraction and repulsion, of growth and decay. Material is systematically accumulated and eroded, in a process resembling a game of chess, where central and secondary notes either expand and proliferate, or are reduced until they disappear . These oppositions include, for example, the confrontation of materials having definite pitch with others of indeterminate pitch. The score systematically catalogues its materials into : # Seven types of events # Seven different ways of placing ornaments relative to a central sound (1) before, (2) simultaneous, (3) after, (4) before and after, (5) simultaneous and after, (6) before and simultaneous, (7) all three # Seven different formal units of the piece # Seven different basic types of grouping notes # Seven possible formal constellations for one complete realisation of seven formal units # Seven possible temporal combinations of adjacent events # Three types of rests separating events (long, medium, short) # Three types of superimposition # Seven possible overall characteristics of a given layer, (1) pitched sound, (2) noise (3‚Äì6) mixed pitch and noise (each one hard or soft), or (7) free There are seven so-called \\"symbol pages\\", on which all musical events are represented by ideograms, and a second set of \\"note pages\\" on which the pitch material for the events is notated. One or several layers of events can be worked out from these fourteen pages, and be combined according to particular rules . The note material is all derived from the prime and inverted forms of the following twelve-tone row : C D G A A G E B D F C F The types wax or wane according to the prescribed plus and minus processes, up to a maximum value of +13, which can result in very long sounds. If a process of diminution continues after reaching a value of 0, the events become represented by a \\"negative band of sound\\"‚Äîa \\"sound wall\\" of noise, such as breathing or radio noise, out of which silent events are cut until a value of ‚Äì13 is reached, which is total silence. At that point, the event-type in question \\"dies\\" and may not be used again in the piece . Reception The score of Plus-Minus is complicated, delivering the message that composing serial music is hard work . The openness of the score was itself seen at the end of the 20th century as a form of control, deterring all but the most committed musicians from undertaking performances. Nevertheless, anyone making a realisation does have considerable control over the nature of the piece, and \\"negative-minded realisers can kill the piece, the over-positive can encourage disproportionate growth\\" . At the first Cologne Courses, a student composer from Iceland, Atli Heimir Sveinsson, \\"assassinated\\" Plus-Minus by deliberately discovering the quickest way to end the piece. According to Stockhausen, \\"There were just a few blips and blobs and then lots of silences ‚Ä¶ that was it\\" . Discography * Karlheinz Stockhausen: Piano Music.

He supported the Parliamentary cause in the English Civil War. He was a rigid Presbyterian and protector of Nonconformists after the Restoration.  Early life  King was the son of Richard King of Ashby de la Launde and his wife Elizabeth Colly, daughter of Anthony Colly of Glaston, Rutland and MP for Rutland. He was a student of Gray's Inn in 1623 but delayed being called to the bar for over 20 years. On the outbreak of the Civil War, he became a captain of foot in the Parliamentary army. He took part in the first attack on Newark, and was indicted for treason at the Lincolnshire assizes in 1643. In the same year, he became Sheriff of Lincolnshire to 1644 and Governor of Boston to 1645. He was also a commissioner for levying money and a commissioner for defence, in the eastern association. In 1644 he was commissioner for assessment for Lincolnshire, Deputy Lieutenant for Lincolnshire and colonel in the parliamentary army. He was freeman of Grimsby in 1645. He quarrelled with Lord Willoughby of Parham and Cromwell regarded him with suspicion. After his commissions were cancelled at the request of the county committee in 1645, he held no further county office until 1658.History of Parliament Online - King, Edward King was finally called to the bar in 1646 and replaced a Royalist as Recorder of Grimsby which position he held until his death. Also in 1646 he stood unsuccessfully for parliament at Grimsby. In 1647 he was accused of obstructing the collection of taxes. He became an ancient of Gray's Inn in 1650. In 1653 he succeeded to the estates of his father, including Ashby Hall. He was commissioner for sewers for Lincolnshire in 1658. In 1659 he was considered to be one of the Lincolnshire Royalists. He was commissioner for militia in March 1660 and a J.P. for Kesteven from March 1660 to 1663.  Political career  In April 1660 King was colonel of the foot militia and was elected Member of Parliament for Grimsby in the Convention Parliament. He was one of the most active MPs, being named to 83 committees, in eight of which he took the chair, acting as teller in 24 divisions, and making 45 recorded speeches. He was commissioner for sewers for Lincolnshire in August 1660, commissioner for assessment for Kesteven, Lincolnshire from August 1660 to 1661, commissioner for disbandment from September 1660 to 1661 and commissioner for maimed soldiers from December 1660 to 1661. He did not stand for re-election in 1661. From 1661 to 1663 he was commissioner for assessment for Lincolnshire and from 1663 to 1664 commissioner for assessment for Kesteven, Lincolnshire. He was described as \\"a great abettor of sectaries and nonconformists\\". He was arrested by the deputy lieutenants during the Second Anglo-Dutch War which he claimed to be an act of personal revenge by Sir Robert Carr and was released after three months. In February 1666 he was committed to the Tower of London for refusing to guarantee his peaceable demeanour. He was expected to enter into a bond for ¬£2,000 \\"to appear where he should be directed by the lord lieutenant or any two deputy lieutenants after 20 hours' notice in writing left at his house, to discover all plots, conspiracies etc. and to abstain from all conventicles and seditious meetings.\\" He claimed these conditions were \\"illegal, infamous and servile‚Äô\\" and bribed his way out of prison. He stood unsuccessfully at a by- election at Grimsby in 1667 and then probably moved to London. He was said to appear daily \\"upon the Exchange\\" in his zeal against the renewal of the Conventicles Act. In 1672, he was granted a licence to hold a Presbyterian meeting at his house in Ashby and it was said that he had counselled or set on above 90 actions at common law in the ecclesiastical court at Lincoln in order to protect those questioned for non-conformity.  Death  King died at Ashby at the age of about 75. King married Anne Ayscough, daughter of Sir Edward Ayscough of Stallingborough, Lincolnshire and had two sons and four daughters.

It was not until approximately a month later, however, that threats occurred with increasing frequency. The number of bomb threats totaled approximately 160 as of April 21, 2012, after which police reported no additional related threats.  Delivery  Several threats were written on bathroom stalls in the Cathedral of Learning and Chevron Science Center. Several more are known to have originated via email. Some of the emails are believed to have been routed through intermediate servers using Mixmaster, a type of anonymous remailer that makes the origin of an email almost impossible to determine. The threats have targeted dozens of buildings at the University of Pittsburgh in addition to buildings at a number of nearby educational institutions: Western Pennsylvania School for Blind Children, Point Park University, California University of Pennsylvania, and Community College of Allegheny County (CCAC).  Investigation  The FBI and Secret Service had identified at least one person of interest related to the case, and local police collaborated with the Department of Justice and the Joint Terrorism Task Force. On April 11, police arrested Mark Lee Krangle, a Pitt alumnus and former teaching fellow who wrote a harassing email to Pitt professors that advised international terrorism was behind the bomb threats, as he disembarked at Pittsburgh International Airport. On the same day, the Pittsburgh US Attorney's Office claimed that \\"significant progress\\" had been made in the investigation of the bomb threats. On April 11, a transgender couple living near Johnstown, Pennsylvania were subpoenaed in relation to the bomb threats. One member of the couple, Seamus Johnston, was enrolled at Pitt-Johnstown as an honors student majoring in computer science until a dispute regarding his use of a male locker room led to his expulsion in January 2012.  Response  The University of Pittsburgh offered a reward of up to $10,000 on March 30 \\"for information leading to an arrest and conviction\\" of those responsible for the threats, which was raised to up to $50,000 on April 2 before being withdrawn on April 21. The University has also removed some bathroom stall doors in the Cathedral of Learning and ramped up security in the building. Chancellor Mark Nordenberg wrote a letter to the University on April 3 in which he said that \\"...those responsible for these threats not only lack basic respect for the thousands of people whose lives have been disrupted by them but must possess a heartless streak,\\" and another on April 6, in which he lamented that \\"It is true ... that this could have happened anywhere. But sadly, it is happening here at Pitt ‚Äì on a campus that is widely recognized as safe by all comparative measures and that is known for its sense of community.\\" On April 8, the University announced that it would be tightening security measures, including provisions such as requiring all people entering University buildings to present University IDs, only allowing students to enter residence halls, and disallowing backpacks and packages from being brought into buildings. This policy was soon changed to allow backpacks into buildings, and on April 9 the Cathedral of Learning had more than one open entrance (All guarded by security).  Conclusion  On April 10, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette received a note from \\"The Threateners\\" demanding that the University of Pittsburgh take down the $50,000 reward they offered for information leading to the culprit or culprits. They offered a 24-hour window without bomb threats, which they upheld. Pitt and the FBI decided to not negotiate with terrorists, ignoring the demand, and the Post-Gazette did not publish a story about the offer. Again on April 20, 2012, The Pitt News, the daily student newspaper, received a similar email from \\"The Threateners\\" offering a 24-hour window without threats, which they stuck to, and then demanded that Pitt takes down the $50,000 reward. Some of the email stated, > this all began when you, Nordenberg, put out a $10,000 ‚Äî then $50,000 ‚Äî > ‚Äòreward‚Äô (bounty) for some young kid who‚Äôd pranked the University. Remember? > That REALLY angered us! Hey, man! This is America! We don't treat our kids > like that! Simply withdraw the 'reward,' and we will end our actions > permanently. They also claimed to have no ties to any persons of interest Pitt has identified. The Pitt News notified the university that it was writing a story about the offer, and the University of Pittsburgh withdrew the $50,000 reward by the morning of April 21, 2012. Since the morning of April 21, there have been no more bomb threats at the University of Pittsburgh. The university's final count of bomb threats was 160, targeting 52 buildings that lead to 136 evacuations. On August 15, 2012, it was reported that Adam Busby of Dublin, Ireland was indicted in connection with the e-mailed threats. As of November 6, 2013 no updates on Adam Busby's involvement have been published. In addition, there have been no indictments whatsoever for the two months of bomb threats at the University of Pittsburgh that occurred before the concluding weeks of threats for which Busby has been indicted.

It aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 11, 2012. The episode spoofs the director Jason Russell, the 2011 film Bully, and the anti-bullying movement. Plot When Butters Stotch's schoolmates see him with a black eye, they learn that it was the work of a bully who stole his lunch money for the third day in a row. Stan Marsh and Kyle Broflovski urge Butters to talk to his family, including his grandmother, whom they mention is visiting him this week. However, his grandmother turns out to be the one who bullies him. Eventually, someone secretly contacts Bucky Bailey, an anti-bullying counselor from Bully Buckers, to come to the school. Bailey obliges Mr. Mackey into calling for an assembly, at which he proposes that the students make an anti- bullying video. When no one volunteers to be the leader of the campaign and direct the video, he starts taunting the assembled students. Stan Marsh volunteers, saying that bullying is a problem that needs to be addressed. Stan produces a music video featuring Cartman dressed in drag and Butters himself paraded in front of everyone in the nude. When Butters expresses reluctance to continue, saying that this will only make things worse, Stan fails to take his viewpoint seriously. As a result, Kyle walks off the project, saying that Stan has made himself the focus of the video and cautions him not to end up \\"naked and jacking it in San Diego\\", a reference that Stan does not understand. Stan informs Butters that a Hollywood studio wants to buy the video. Though Stan is cheered by his schoolmates, Bailey corners Stan in the school boys' room, berating him because Stan sold the movie without consulting him, as revenue from the video, which was Bailey's idea, could have brought national exposure to Bully Buckers‚Ñ¢. This upsets Stan, who soon breaks down into tears. Later, Mick Jabs, the president of the studio that purchased the video, corners Bailey in the school boys' room, and presents a cease and desist order from his lawyers, threatening to sue him if he licenses the video again. Stan and Butters go on The Dr. Oz Show to promote the movie, but as Dr. Oz continuously tries to pry Butters of his dark secrets in an effort to get him to reveal specifics, Butters finally snaps and attacks Oz. Afterwards, Jabs excoriates Stan because the country did not see Butters as a bully victim, but as a violent psychopath. Soon Jabs himself is cornered in a restroom by Jesus, who threatens him with Hell for his behavior if he does not apologize for his hurtful remark regarding the failed taping. Later that night, Butters goes to his grandmother's room as she lies in bed, telling her that he finally stood up for himself. While he admits that it felt good, it ultimately left with him a dark and empty feeling, just as he imagines she feels. He then tells her that he has realized that bullies will always exist, and while such stages in life seem as if they will last forever to kids, one day he will grow into a happy adult, and as she lies dying in a hospital, he will visit her to show her that he is still alive and happy, while she will die the same empty, sad person she has always been. The next day, Stan is pilloried by students and teachers at school for humiliating them, as well as Jabs' studio canceling its distribution of the video and a lawsuit that Dr. Oz has filed against Stan and South Park Elementary, Stan resolves to go to San Diego where, in a musical number, he strips off his clothes in public and dances in the nude on a street corner, √† la Jason Russell. Critical reception Max Nicholson of IGN gave the episode a 7.5 \\"Good\\" rating, lauding the reveal of Butters' grandmother as the bully, and finding her verbal abuse of Butters to be \\"priceless\\". Though the bathroom gag was more disappointing than Nicholson thought it would be, Nicholson felt that the scenes with Butters and his grandmother tied the episode together, in particular his final \\"moment of clarity\\" speech. Nicholson also enjoyed Stan's nude dance in San Diego, not knowing it was a reference to the Jason Russell scandal. Nicholson was less impressed by the students' music video, as he did not initially know that it was a nod to an anti-bullying music video made at Cypress Ranch High School, which he thought was too obscure a reference, marring the episode somewhat. Carl Cortez of Assignment X gave the episode a B+, calling their take on school bullying \\"hilarious\\", and saying of the interaction between Butters and his grandmother, \\"It‚Äôs brilliant and funny and wrong, but the best South Park's always are.\\"Cortez, Carl (April 12, 2012). \\"TV Review: SOUTH PARK ‚Äì Season 16 ‚Äì 'Butterballs'\\".

It is commonly known as the sand star or the sand sifting star but these names are also applied to starfish in the genus Astropecten. It is found in shallow waters in the Indo-Pacific region. Description Archaster typicus is a five-limbed star with long, slightly tapering arms with pointed tips. Occasionally three, four, or even six-armed individuals occur. Adults grow to in diameter, with males often being smaller than females. This starfish is adapted to life on the sandy seabed, where it buries in the sediment during high tides and moves over the sediment surface during low tides. The general colour is grey or brownish, variously marked with darker and lighter patches, sometimes forming a chevron pattern. The underside is pale. The body is slightly inflated and there is a whitish madreporite near the centre of the disc. The small armour plates that cover the upper surface of the arms are lined up in neat parallel rows which distinguishes it from the rather similar Astropecten polyacanthus which has similar habits and colouring. The spines, arranged in a marginal fringe, are short, flat and blunter than A. polyacanthus and the tube feet have suckers and not points.Telling Apart Sand Stars: Archaster vs. Astropecten! Two Common Trade Species Echinoblog. Retrieved 2012-04-08.Common Sea Star ‚Äì Archaster typicus WildSingapore. Retrieved 2012-04-08. Distribution and habitat Archaster typicus is found in the western Indian Ocean and the Indo-Pacific at depths down to . The range includes the Maldive Islands, the Bay of Bengal, Singapore, northern Australia, New Caledonia, the Philippines, China, southern Japan and Hawaii. It usually inhabits areas of the seabed with soft sediments including sand, silt and seagrass meadows. Larval settlement occurs among mangroves, while individuals gradually move to seagrass and sandy habitats as they age. Feeding Archaster typicus is a detritivore and eats detritus and anything else edible it comes across. To feed, it everts its stomach through its mouth which is situated centrally on its underside. The food item is engulfed and brought inside the starfish when its stomach is returned to its normal position. Reproduction Like other starfish, Archaster typicus is a broadcast spawner, the male and female starfish each liberate their gametes into the sea where fertilisation takes place. However, in contrast to most other starfish, Archaster typicus performs pseudocopulation. Specimens reach sexual maturity at a radius of 29 mm. About two months ahead of spawning the starfish begin to congregate, with males in particular becoming more mobile. A starfish can tell whether another is male or female, probably by chemotactic recognition. On recognizing a female, the male will climb on top of her and may remain there for two months. The female can move about and feed but the male is more restricted in his activities. During this time they synchronize their gonadal activity so that when the female is ready to spawn, so is the male. When she releases her eggs, he releases his sperm almost simultaneously thereby increasing the chances that successful fertilisation will take place.The Sex Life of Archaster!

It was written by series creator and executive producer Matthew Weiner and writer Victor Levin, and directed by Matt Shakman. It originally aired on the AMC channel in the United States on April 8, 2012. The episode takes place in July 1966, featuring much discussion among the characters about the Richard Speck murders in Chicago. Don runs into an ex-lover and cannot seem to escape her presence. Joan's husband, Greg, returns from his tour of duty in Vietnam only to reveal that he is being sent back for another year of service. Sally becomes frightened after reading stories on the Speck murders, leading her step-grandmother to educate her on the concepts of fear and defense. Dawn spends the night at Peggy's apartment after becoming too afraid to return home because of racial violence near Harlem. The episode's title is derived from the 1965 Milton Bradley board game for teenage girls, Mystery Date, wherein several female players draw cards to advance to opening a door, hoping to find one of a variety of desirable male dates on the other side, while simultaneously hoping to avoid the lone undesirable one. A vintage television commercial for the game is viewed by Don's daughter Sally during the episode. The storylines involving Joan, Sally, and Peggy were well received, although some felt the dream sequence was a heavy-handed way to have Don deal with his past infidelities. \\"Mystery Date\\" had consistent viewership with the previous week, with 2.8 million overall viewers and 1.0 million viewers in the 18-49 demographic. Critics noted the dark atmosphere of the episode, with Weiner comparing it to a horror movie. The episode carried themes of sexual violence and the concept of masculinity. Plot Joyce Ramsay walks into Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce with graphic photos of the recently committed murders of eight nurses in Chicago. There were nine possible victims, with the one survivor hiding under the bed until the murderer left. Ginsberg reacts in disgust to the other employees' fascination with the murder photos. Don Draper, on the elevator to SCDP's offices with Megan, is coughing profusely, sweaty, and feverish. A flirty former lover, Andrea Rhodes, walks into the elevator and starts to home in on Don before Don introduces Megan as his wife. Don tries to assuage a slightly perturbed Megan, who is upset over how many of Don's old flames they run into in Manhattan. Don works with new hire Michael Ginsberg and Ken Cosgrove on the pitch to Butler Footwear. Ginsberg goes rogue during the presentation and ends up pitching a commercial based on Cinderella, which the group had earlier rejected as being too cliche - although that was what the executives were expecting, and they reject the pitch they had earlier approved in favor of a Cinderella campaign. Don is enraged and admonishes Ginsberg for the act; Ginsberg doesn't seem to realize the seriousness of his transgression until Ken points out he was on the verge of being fired. Afterwards, Don returns home early to an empty house and collapses on his bed in a weakened state. Don awakens to a knock on the door. It's Andrea, still in her tight yellow dress. Don directs her to leave immediately and forces her to go out through the apartment's service elevator. After Don returns to bed, Andrea walks into his bedroom again, having entered through the unlocked back door. She seduces Don and the two end up having sex in his bed. In a post- coital moment, Andrea declares to Don that he will continue meeting her for trysts because he can't change who he is. Don flies off the handle and chokes her to death. Panicking, he kicks her under the bed, but one of her red shoes remains visible, recalling both the visual of Ginsberg's Cinderella pitch and the lone survivor from the Richard Speck murders. Don awakens the next morning to realize he was having a fever dream. He says nothing of his vision to Megan and tells her she doesn't need to worry about him. Sally's overbearing step- grandmother Pauline is babysitting Sally while Betty and Henry are out of town. Sally overhears Pauline having a telephone conversation about the murders in Chicago. After stealing a newspaper out of the garbage and reading about the murder, Sally becomes frightened and unable to sleep. Pauline comforts Sally by suggesting the nurses asked for their fate for presumed lasciviousness. Pauline takes out a butcher knife, intending to use it for protection, and splits a Seconal with Sally. Betty and Henry return home the next day to find Pauline asleep on a couch with the butcher knife on a table by her side. Sally is asleep underneath the couch, once again recalling the visual of the Speck survivor. Roger asks Peggy to devise a new Mohawk Airlines campaign over the weekend, in an attempt to cover for the fact that he had neglected to put the creative team on that task a week earlier. Peggy, realizing that for once she has the upper hand, agrees to the favor only after Roger hands over all the cash in his wallet ($410, an exorbitant amount in 1966), rejecting the ten dollars which Roger initially offered her (explaining that \\"the work is ten dollars; the lie is extra.\\"). While working late, Peggy discovers Dawn sleeping in Don's office. Peggy offers Dawn a spot on her couch at home, as Dawn worries about returning to her own home in Harlem due to racial tension in the area. Peggy and Dawn drink beers at Peggy's apartment, while Peggy reveals insecurity over whether she \\"acts like a man\\" or not. While leaving her apartment's living room, Peggy has an awkward moment with Dawn when Peggy realizes that her purse (with Roger's cash still inside) is alone on the table next to Dawn. Peggy cleans up and leaves the purse next to Dawn. Peggy wakes up the next morning to find a note from Dawn apologizing for inconveniencing Peggy. Joan's husband Greg returns home from the Vietnam War after a year of service, greeting their new baby boy, and spending an afternoon with Joan in bed. Afterwards, Greg breaks bad news to Joan‚Äîhe is being shipped back out again for another year. Joan complains about the government's lies, but Greg backs up his duty to the country. During a dinner at a fancy restaurant with Joan's mother and Greg's parents, Greg is forced by his mother to reveal that he in fact volunteered to go back, sending Joan into a rage. She is absolutely horrified that Greg would abandon his duties as a father to head back to war, where he \\"feels like a good man\\". The next morning, Joan sits him down and tells him to leave. Through her teeth, she proclaims that he was \\"never a good man\\", subtly referring to the time he raped her back in the second season. Greg storms out, and Joan informs her mother that \\"it's over\\". Joan spends the night lying awake next to her sleeping mother and child. Production \\"Mystery Date\\" was written by creator Matthew Weiner and co-executive producer Victor Levin. The episode was also directed by Matt Shakman. Director Matt Shakman had never worked on an episode of Mad Men before this episode. This was also the first episode of the series that co-writer Victor Levin had penned. Levin had actually worked in advertising before becoming a television writer. He was the Associate Creative Director at both the Young and Rubicam advertising agency as well as BBDO. Both agencies had been either mentioned or depicted on Mad Men in the past. Levin also won two Clio awards for his work in advertising, which was an award Don won last season in the episode \\"Waldorf Stories\\". \\"The theme of sexual violence, of what it means to be a man, is a big part of that episode,\\" creator Matthew Weiner said of \\"Mystery Date\\". \\"There's this idea of this carnal, dangerous impulsive male. Of the dream sequence, Hamm said, \\"Unlike a lot of things on our show, it's very visceral and immediate and scary and weird\\" with Hamm noting that Weiner compared the episode to a horror film. The scene in which Peggy blackmails Roger was one of Elisabeth Moss's favorite moments, with Moss saying that she was \\"playing Roger Sterling\\" in that scene. Weiner was fascinated by the presences of the Richard Speck murders in the media, despite the 40 race riots occurring in America around the same time. \\"Part of that force is the sex drive. No one wants to be a victim of that, but when you look at Pauline's interest in the murders, it's sexual. It's such a deep touchstone of creepiness,\\" he noted. The footage of Don returning to bed after kicking Andrea out of the apartment was actually reverse footage of Don getting out of bed only minutes before, which led some to believe that this was a directorial touch by Shakman to help the viewer discern the dream sequence by including unreal footage. Reception =Ratings= \\"Mystery Date\\" received steady viewership that was consistent with the ratings for the previous week. It received 2.8 million viewers, down only from 2.9 from \\"Tea Leaves\\". The episode also received a 1.0 rating in the important 18-49 demographic, the same rating as the week before. =Critical reception= While the portions of the episode focusing on Joan, Peggy, and Sally were critically acclaimed, some critics were mixed on the value of the dream sequence. One writer for Zap2it declared the episode one of the best episodes yet. Alan Sepinwall, writing for Hitfix said that the episode was \\"full of nightmares and self-realizations\\" as well as \\"horrifying images\\". Sepinwall wrote that the \\"only way the strangulation scene would have been acceptable to me was with the understanding going in that it was a dream. Had the show not telegraphed that ‚Äî or had I not figured it out ‚Äî and Don woke up the next morning with no corpse on the floor, I'd have been irked.\\" One writer for Paste Magazine noted that the \\"brilliantly shot\\" episode had a \\"Hitchcockian feel\\", and pointed to the use of \\"reverse point-of-view shots\\" and \\"close-ups of hands on doorknobs that added an air of suspense not usually present on Mad Men.\\" Eric Goldman of IGN declared it the \\"best episode yet for Season 5, with some very good material for Joan, Peggy, Don and Sally packed into a busy hour.\\" Goldman praised the resolution to the Harris marriage, crediting Weiner with mastering \\"the slow burn on this show, and it was just so gratifying to finally have this issue be dealt with.\\" Maureen Ryan of The Huffington Post called the episode \\"deeply unsettling\\" on purpose. She said that \\"Violence against women was inescapable in this episode, but what made Mad Men's exploration of the topic worthwhile and compelling was the fact that two women in this episode asserted their power and control over their lives. It wasn't a story about helplessness and victimization; it was an episode about everything from sweaty discomfort to outright terror, and how we deal with those emotions.\\" John Swansburg, writing for Slate, said the episode was a \\"dud,\\" with the fever dream a \\"very obvious (and not particularly enlightening) way to depict Don wrestling with his infidelity issues.\\" Jordan Bartel of the Baltimore Sun compared \\"Mystery Date\\" to a Stephen King novel. Meredith Blake of the Los Angeles Times admitted that the dream sequence was \\"heavy-handed\\" but that \\"there‚Äôs also something terribly convincing about the link 'Mystery Date' posits between Don‚Äôs seemingly insatiable sexual appetite and his personal demons. If only these things dissipated as easily as a fever.\\" Rolling Stone writer Sarene Leeds praised Christina Hendricks' performance and the dream sequence, asking \\"even though it wasn't \\"real,\\" what makes Don Draper any different from Richard Speck, the student-nurse murderer?\\" References External links *\\"Mystery Date\\" at AMC Category:2012 American television episodes Category:Mad Men (season 5) episodes ","title":"Mystery Date (Mad Men)"},{"id":"35406292","title":"Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta candidates in the 2012 Alberta provincial election"},{"id":"35406311","title":"Wildrose Party candidates in the 2012 Alberta provincial election"},{"id":"35406450","text":"Ofahoma is an unincorporated community in Leake County, Mississippi, United States.

Originally opened in 1954 as an outdoor at Shute Park, an indoor recreation center and pool opened in 1981. The indoor recreation center, which includes a weight room, spa, a wading pool, and classroom space, was expanded in 2006 at a cost of $9 million. History Proposals to build a pool for the city began as early as 1934 when the city council referred one plan to the city‚Äôs budget committee.Swimming Pool Proposed, The Oregonian, October 4, 1934, p. 6. That proposal would have been paid for using bonds and be built by the New Deal's State Emergency Relief Administration at Shute Park. Plans to build a pool at Shute Park came to fruition in 1953 when the project was allotted about $90,000 in controlled materials by the National Production Authority,Oregon Firms Get Materials, The Oregonian, March 1, 1953, p. 29 after $90,000 in bonds were approved by voters in June 1950 for construction of a pool. The pool then opened in 1954, and the next year the city decided to keep it operating seven days a week during the summer.Pool Keeps Open. p. 19, June 26, 1955, The Oregonian. That original outdoor pool is long and wide. During the early years of the facility, it hosted an annual water show that included diving, water ballet, and a comedy skit.Water Show Features Ballet, Clowns. The Oregonian, p. 13, August 19, 1960. A $2.6 million bond measure went before voters in September 1979 to finance construction of an indoor pool, along with a second operating levy to pay for the operations. The plan called for a main pool, a sauna, racquetball courts, a shallow pool for children, and a hydrotherapy pool, among other amenities. Voters passed both of the measures for what would be a center, with construction beginning in summer 1980. The aquatics center was completed in 1981 and opened in September that year. The facility included an indoor pool with locker rooms, a weight room, and three racquetball courts. The new center cost $2.5 million to build, with C.A. Lantz Construction Co. serving as the general contractor. The project faced several delays due to leaks in the roof. The main indoor pool is long and wide. In August 1988, the original pool house for the outdoor pool became the new headquarters for the Parks and Recreation Department after a $65,000 remodeling project. The city worked to repair the roof on the center in 1989 while also suing the original contractor over the leaking roof. A family of three A & W Burger statues were moved to the grounds of the center in 1991 from the Papa Aldo‚Äôs restaurant across the street. Considered a temporary move at the time, the family was missing the Teen Burger character when the former restaurant owner donated the fiberglass statues to the city. Exterior of the aquatic center By 1998 pool usage had climbed to approximately 200,000 annual visits, so the city put forward a bond measure to voters to build a new pool at the aquatic center and to build a new aquatic in the Ronler Acres area. The new center would include a wave pool and overall the bond would have allow for borrowing of $15.7 million for the projects. The bond went to voters in May and received more than 50% of the vote, but Oregon‚Äôs double majority rule prevented the measure from passing. The city tried again in November 1998, but the measure failed. In September 2004, the center closed for renovations that included fixing the roof and plumbing. The center was to be closed until June 2005, though the outdoor pool was to remain open during the originally estimated $5.2 million project that would also expand the center. Although the center closed in September, a contract for the construction was not finalized until December 2004 when Todd Construction won with a $6.4 million bid. At that time, the pool was scheduled to re-open in November or December 2005. While the Shute Park facility was under renovation, the city began plans to build a second aquatic center for the city. In January 2006, the city announced plans to build a center at Northeast 53rd Avenue where they had purchased , including a storage building once used by Soloflex. That property became 53rd Avenue Park that opened in 2008. The Shute Park center re-opened in March 2006 after a $9 million expansion and renovation. After the expansion, SHARC was then in size that allowed for expanding indoor activities such as group exercise, more classrooms, and other classes that had been held at the Tyson Recreation Center. In August 2008, employees used an automated external defibrillator to help save a visitor's life. By 2011 the center served approximately 230,000 people each year. Amenities Located at southwest Maple Street at Tenth Avenue, SHARC has a variety of water based and indoor features. Pools include the original outdoor pool that measures by and has two diving boards, but is only opening during the summer. Indoors are the main pool and a smaller wading pool designed for children and beginning swimmers. The main pool is by and L-shaped that includes a slide and one diving board. The smaller wading pool includes an elevated teacup. As a recreation center, SHARC has a weight room, a cardio room, and multipurpose rooms where various classes are offered. There is also a spa pool and dry sauna. Other amenities include locker rooms, including a family changing area, child care, and a snack bar.

The videos feature Kyle Lamar Myers, an American from Franklin County, Georgia, playing the role of Dimitri, a heavily accented Russian from Moscow. Each video on the channel generally has Myers explaining the characteristics of the weapons he will use in that video (occasionally telling the history behind it and sometimes explanations of its purpose), before he demonstrates their abilities on targets such as fruits, drink bottles, zombie targets, and photos of Justin Bieber in his earlier videos. The FPSRussia channel reached the 1-million- subscriber mark in June 2011. As of July 30, 2020, his channel has garnered over 6.8 million subscribers. Myers has used largely varying pieces of equipment along with weapons that have been featured in his videos such as a golden AK-47, an armored troop carrier, a .50 BMG rifle, and a Bofors 40 mm automatic anti-aircraft cannon. Myers ceased producing new videos in 2016. History Before Myers started FPSRussia, he ran a YouTube channel called \\"klm5986\\". Centered around Call of Duty gameplay commentary, this channel often featured videos with other YouTube personalities, such as xSocrates. He later wanted to show how guns worked in real life and to compare them to how they are portrayed in video games, films, and television shows. He got the idea for a Russian accent while working at a car dealership. One of his co- workers was Russian and he took an interest in impersonating his accent. His uncle was also a prankster and used to use the accent while talking to Kyle when he was five years old. He used the accent to create the character Dimitri and what followed was him filming himself shooting guns on his family farm in Georgia.. After a nine-month hiatus, on January 10, 2014, FPSRussia returned to YouTube. The channel has been inactive since April 2016. Appearances in other media Due to the success of FPSRussia, Myers opened up a second channel, MoreFPSRussia. Myers collaborated with Epic Meal Time in July 2011. The collaboration has earned over 8.8 million video views on YouTube as of October 14, 2020. Myers' character hosted the live fire section of Machinima.com Prime's web series, The Controller: Medal of Honor Warfighter. On October 29, 2012, Myers had a cameo appearance as his character, Dimitri, in the Call of Duty: Black Ops II live-action trailer directed by Guy Ritchie. After an announcement video in December 2012 and a successful Kickstarter campaign, FPSRussia released \\"FPS Russia: The Game\\" on the App Store for iOS devices in March 2013 with developer Zaah. In 2010, Myers co-founded the podcast Painkiller Already (PKA) with YouTubers WoodysGamertag and WingsOfRedemption, a show now hosted by Myers, WoodysGamertag and MurkaDurkah. In 2013, Myers founded another gaming channel named \\"FPS\\" that has been inactive since 2014. In 2014, FPSRussia was listed on NewMediaRockstars Top 100 Channels, ranked at #78. Death of Keith Ratliff On January 3, 2013, Keith Ratliff, a member of the FPSRussia's production team, was found shot dead in his home. Ratliff was responsible for obtaining the firearms used in the videos. Following Ratliff's death, the production of FPSRussia's videos went on hiatus until February 19, 2013. In March 2013, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) said it was still investigating. However, as there have been no official updates since the initial reports following Ratliff's death, the case has become the subject of numerous conspiracy theories. ATF raids On March 29, 2013, Myers' Georgia residence was searched by upwards of 40 members of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives alongside officers from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. The investigators also searched Myers's father's nearby farm, a frequent filming location for FPSRussia. ATF spokesman Richard Coes said the justification for the search was \\"that [Myers] was using explosives and getting paid for it via YouTube.\\" In August 2017, Myers' residence was again raided after Myers was alleged to have received 25 grams of butane hash oil through the mail. The federal courts prosecuted on the grounds that illegal drug possession while owning a firearm is a federal offense. Myers was arrested for felony possession of a restricted substance with intent to distribute and 50 of his weapons were confiscated under a federal law that prohibits illegal drug users from possessing firearms. He later pleaded guilty to Possession with Intent to Distribute Marijuana and Butane Hash Oil, with all other charges dismissed. On June 19, 2019, Myers was sentenced to two years' probation and two months in prison, which he served later in 2019, as well as a fine in the amount of $7500. Since his release from prison, Myers has spoken about the case on his YouTube podcast Painkiller Already.

The size of the surplus changed significantly over time and mostly disappeared by 2017, which has led to shortages. Other surpluses were described as beef mountains, milk lakes, wine lakes and grain mountains. Excesses existed because the agricultural policies were designed to stabilise prices for farmers and consumers and to ensure that there was enough produce at all times, but production varied from year to year, so in most years there was an excess. Excesses were often sold off cheaply either within the EU or to other markets.  History  Agricultural underproduction in the 1950s led to a series of market interventions, including the Common Agricultural Policy. Governments subsidized milk production by a guaranteed minimum intervention price for dairy products. This led to a surge in the production of grain, milk, butter and related products until production exceeded demand in the late 1970s, resulting in a glut. Milk production in West Germany alone increased from 75 million tonnes in 1960 to nearly 100 million tonnes by 1979. To combat the overproduction, governments introduced milk quotas, which were governed by the Common Agricultural Policy. In the following decades, production continued to outstrip demand, and the European governments and later the European Union would purchase tonnes of the surplus agricultural goods, creating so-called \\"milk lakes\\" and \\"butter\\" or \\"beef mountains\\".  \\"Christmas butter\\"  In West Germany, between 1979 and 1985, excess butter was sold at discounted prices under the direction of the Federal Ministry for Food, Agriculture and Forests and was limited to per household. The packages were labelled as being the product of intervention stockpiles and were specifically intended to reduce that oversupply.  Decline  In 2003, it was reported that the EU warehoused 194,000 tonnes of powdered milk and 223,000 tonnes of butter. In 2007, rising demand and planned reforms were forecast to eliminate the oversupply of milk and butter eventually. By 2009, the butter mountain had returned because of a steep decline in the price of dairy products. In 2017, it was reported that European butter stockpiles had largely disappeared because of increased demand and dwindling production, which caused shortages and rising prices.

Biography According to the RKD he was the son of the cityscape painter Carel Lodewijk Hansen and the brother of Carel II (born 1793).Lambertus Johannes Hansen in the RKD He was a pupil of his father, Jean Augustin Daiwaille, Charles Howard Hodges, Jan Hulswit, Pieter Barbiers IV and Jan Willem Pieneman. His main subject was the painting of inner houses, with doorways and incident lights. He is known for historical interiors in the manner of Pieter de Hooch. Both at the Royal Academy of Art in Amsterdam, as well as at the Society Felix Meritis, he won several prizes. In 1832 he won a silver medal for his painting after a nude model in the category nudes. In 1833 he became a fellow member of the Amsterdam Academy and also a teacher at that institution. He later taught Hendrik Jacobus Scholten when he became a teacher there. He was married in 1834 to Cornelia Helena Anna Christiani, whom he lost after giving him three sons (died 1842), the oldest of whom was six years old. Lambertus married a second time on 5 April 1847 to Geertruij Meeltj Stijnis. After his death on 6 September 1859, his legacy was sold at Amsterdam, there were paintings from the 17th and 18th centuries and from his own time, drawings by himself and by former masters, prints, further castes, furniture and clothing, silverware and porcelain.

The buildings are laid out in a labyrinthine, non-hierarchical and non- institutional way, integrating the new buildings with the existing 1930s cottage and the landscape on the site. The buildings were designed to accommodate the school‚Äôs approach to active learning, embodied in the child- scaled and multi-purpose buildings.Victorian Heritage Register (Heritage Register Number: Prov H0072), HERMES ID: 13627, 18.7.05, pg 4-5 Description Kevin Borland Hall (1962) The first building Kevin Borland designed for the school was the ‚ÄòPreshil school hall‚Äô, later renamed to ‚ÄòKevin Borland Hall‚Äô, constructed in 1962. It was designed for multi-purpose use and with its octagonal shape it was a clear departure from the usual nave-like school halls. It is most famous for its intricate octagonal timber roof structure with skylights. It has wooden beams that span both the hall and the sheltered bays outside of it. The roof is clad in steel deck, and the walls are built of grey concrete blocks.Victorian Heritage. Preshil School Hall. Victorian Heritage Database. [Cited: 04 09, 2012.] http://vhd.heritage.vic.gov.au/vhd/heritagevic#detail_places;22341 In 1959 Kevin Borland and Geoff Trewenack designed glazed pyramidal skylights in the McCarthy-house that acted as a precedent of the roof structure at the Preshil school hall.Kevin Borland and the Two Strands of Melbourne Modernism House, prep room and library (1930s, 1964, 1975) In 1994 Borland designed classrooms for pre-school children in an addition to the east end of the original house (the 1930s), incorporating what once was a bedroom and sitting room of the house. Borland wanted to design an informal building that referred to the kid's scale with a combination of small and large spaces. Large, open classrooms with mezzanine floors that can be reached with ladders, provide the kids with an opportunity to isolate themselves from the group when they want to. The addition is a rectangular timber building with an elevated verandah along its length. In 1975 a second addition to the original house was made by Borland and his associate, Jenny Shannon. This time it was a second-floor addition to the rear of the original house. It is an irregular form built with brick, raw timber and glass with multiple levels. It was supposed to be a staff room, but quickly turned into the school library, with a good view of the site. The ‚Äòtree house‚Äô (1965 The ‚ÄòTreehouse‚Äô, built in 1965, consists of two elevated rectangular timber classrooms, with long window-shades by timber slats and timber bays along one side of the building. The two rooms are separated by a timber deck, through which an Italian Cyprus grows, giving the building its name. Underneath the deck is a space used for woodwork classes and sandpits.Victorian Heritage. Preshil, The Margaret Lyttle School. Victorian Heritage Database [Cited: 04 09, 2012.] http://vhd.heritage.vic.gov.au/vhd/heritagevic#detail_places;71605 Multi- purpose tutorial rooms (1939, 1969) The original rectangular classroom, built 1939, was modified by Kevin Borland together with Philip Cohen as assistant architect in 1969. The intent was to create multi-purpose ‚Äòtutorial‚Äô classrooms that provides private and community spaces. This is achieved by large classrooms that can be divided with folding doors. The building is long, rectangular and with an open veranda along the north side. The ‚Äòhome-rooms‚Äô (1972) In 1972, Borland and assistant architect John Kenny built the irregularly planned timber building called the ‚Äòhome rooms‚Äô. It has a variety of spaces on different levels that are linked by steps, and a mezzanine level for the children to find private places in that can be reached by ladder. To provide spaces for individual activities, the west wall zig-zags. Key influences and design approach The schools approach education informed the design approach used. The layout accommodates active learning throughout the many internal and external spaces provided. The school's pupils were involved in the design process, providing feedback to both the architect and the teachers. Preshil, and in particular those buildings designed by Borland, continue a relationship began in the early 20th century between experimental teaching techniques, psychoanalysis and experimental architecture. A belief that learning environments are integral to the development of a child was expressed first in Europe in schools such as A. S Neill's Summerhill School and at Dartington Hall where a number of well-known modern architects worked. In Australia, the Koornong School at Warrandyte (1939‚Äì1947) continued these ideas, in 1939 commissioning local architect Best Overend to design the school's vernacular-style timber buildings of which only the headmaster's house survives. Borland was familiar with the Koornong School and his Preshil buildings resemble those at Koornong in their light timber construction, elevation and random placement around the site. The rooms are lit via clerestory windows and walls of sliding glass doors and the internal spaces can be divided by folding doors to allow for different uses. There are many small spaces attached to the main spaces, and elevated platforms which the children can reach by ladders. In an interview undertaken in 1974 Borland stated: ‚ÄúObserving the fact that all kids love to climb and be on different levels, I designed a building that would reflect this by use of levels, and low spaces for example. They like the comfortable feeling of the low scale ‚Äì it‚Äôs almost the womb-like syndrome.‚Äù‚ÄúA Guide to Melbourne Architecture‚Äù Philip Goad, Watermark Press, 1999, pg187 The buildings at Preshil, designed by Borland and his associates, are experimental in design and materials and reflect the participatory design methods becoming fashionable in architecture in the 1960s and 1970s. At Preshil, school children participated in the design process, evident in the scale and informality of the design. Preshil is an early and outstanding example of the interest of Melbourne architects, led by Borland, in inventive timber architecture, in structural techniques and expressive form, reflecting the exploratory lifestyles of the 1960s and 1970s. Preshil is historically significant in reflecting the social changes taking place during the 1960s, in particular the emergence of a counterculture and dissatisfaction with traditional middle class values, including the conservatism of traditional schools and their educational methods. Preshil is the only progressive school in Melbourne surviving from the major period of interest in progressive schools in the 1920s and 30s, when the relationship between a child's development and their learning environment began to be explored through experimental architecture.

Oxwich is part of the small community of Penrice which extends from the village of Horton to Oxwich Bay, and as of 2001 recorded a population of 454 inhabitants. Oxwich's main site of historical interest is the castle which is thought by many academics to be the most historic castle on the Gower Peninsula. The earliest evidence of it being inhabited is in 1459, where Philip Mansel was recorded as holding it. The Mansel family were a minor gentry in South Wales, who grew in power and prestige under the Tudor monarchs. The parish church of St. Illtyd's overlooks Oxwich Bay. A place of worship has stood on this site since the 6th century, but the main tower of today was built in the 14th century. The chancel of this church is thought to be a 6th-century cell. The church bell in the tower also dates back to the 14th century, but was recast in 1892. In the churchyard there is a well, which locals believe is haunted by a ghost. Legend has it that a ghost was seen in the churchyard before vanishing into a well. National nature reserve The series of coastal sand-dunes, lakes and woodland form a National nature reserve designated for its great variety of ecosystems, its rare and unusual plant life and for it very unusual combinmation of environment in such close proximity. Tourism The Oxwich Bay Hotel is close to the church of St. Illtyd, set in eight acres of land overlooking the west end of Oxwich Bay. There is also a campsite in Oxwich. It has a heated swimming pool and accepts tents and trailers. Geography and wildlife Short video by Natural Resources Wales of some of the animals at Oxwich Oxwich Bay is one of the most popular beaches in Gower, which has an expanse of curving sand, with Cefn Bryn in the background. The nearby woods at Nicholston however, came under threat in the 1950s, when they were bought by a speculator who 'was more interested in reducing the woods to timber than re-planning an over-mature landscape.' An Oxwich Bay protection Fund was then launched, and a compromise was agreed to ensure limited felling.

Biography Begijnesteeg, Haarlem According to the RKD he was a pupil of Pieter Pietersz Barbiers.Carel Lodewijk Hansen in the RKD He was the father and teacher of Carel Lodewijk II and Lambertus Johannes Hansen. He became a member of the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke in 1794, shortly before it was dissolved in 1797. He became a member of Felix Meritis in 1809. He received a gold medal in 1818 in the category \\"cityscapes\\". He is known for cityscapes and landscapes, often in moonlight. In 1807 he painted a cityscape of Leiden after a powder ship explosion wrecked several houses (and all of the stained glass in the churches) in the city center. Louis Bonaparte came personally to inspect the damage, which endeared him to the townspeople for his show of empathy. The painting echoes, but lacks the poignancy of Vermeer's View of Delft however, which shows the gap in the cityscape after the Delft Explosion of 1654 without showing the damage directly. In 1816 he worked on a large Panorama of the battle of Waterloo in Amsterdam, that was compared favorably to the London version.comparison of the Londensche en het Amsterdamsche panorama van den veldslag bij Waterloo in the DBNL His topographical cityscapes were etched by himself and others, with three published series showing scenes of Haarlem, Bergen, and Drente.

Early life and education Bermejo's birthdate is a rather unusual date in the Basque Country, as it refers to the day that ETA arose. After studying at the University of Deusto he received a degree in History and also received a degree in Anthropology from the Autonomous University of Barcelona. Career Back in his home town of San Sebasti√°n, Bermejo started his creative career as a performer in the group, 'CLOC'. He was one of the group's founders, along with Fernando Aramburu. His first major award was the 'City of San Sebasti√°n' in 1983 for his story 'The Socialist'. He won the 'Mercer' award five years later in 1988 with a translation into Euskara another of his stories, 'Towards the Dawn - Egunsentirantz'. Between 1983 and 1986 he brought against the newspaper 'The Voice of Euskadi'. In 1988 he began working in the Basque Journal, 'El Diario Vasco', covering sections of interviews and comments as' People ow Word or Living on Line'. In 1998 Bermejo had his first encounter with the sculptor Jorge Oteiza, with whom he maintained a close friendship that decisively marked his personal and creative life. Committed to his country and its reality, the shock provoked by the murder of Gregorio Ord√≥√±ez (21 July 1958 - 23 January 1995) a popular deputy of the 'Basque Parliament' prompted him to give a speech in a memorable tribute with prominent individuals such as Fernando Savater or Kepa Aulestia. Thereafter, he began to feel the pressure of radical nationalism, and was nearly shot to death like his friends such as former Socialist minister Ernest Lluch and journalist Jose Luis Lopez de la Calle. Bermejo rejected any form of police protection and continued to live in San Sebastian, defending an independent position held by his weekly articles in 'El Diario Vasco'. Between 1996 and 1998 he coordinated the international cycle of conferences 'More than six proposals for the next Millennium', which was attended by thinkers like Noam Chomsky, Fernando Arrabal and Fran√ßois Baudrillard. From 1997 to 2007 Bermejo advised the project 'Under the skin of the other', led by Karin Ohlenschlager and Luis Rico, in collaboration with the Europe Foundation. Since 2006 he is an advisor to the Institute Medialab and the E-Biolab. In 2008 he led a relevant Summer School at the University of the Basque Country, 'Internet, The Last Utopia', attended by prominent individuals such as Stephan Harding, Derrick de Kerckhove and Lynn Margulis. Since 2009 Bermejo began coordinating the San Sebastian node within the network 'Symbiolab', centered on the symbiosis: cognitive, cultural, scientific and environmental. As a writer, Bermejo was released in Spain after the publication of 'The Kingdom of one thousand' (1997), Award City of Salamanca. Before this he had published titles like 'The Sands and Temple' (1985), 'The Madonna of the Storm' (1989), 'The Descent of Orpheus' (1991), 'Varanasi' (1995) and 'The Game of Mandrake' (1996). These four titles gave him the 'National Literature Award of the Basque Government'. In 2001 he won the award 'Ateneo de Sevilla' with La Piedra Iman. In 2008 he returned to win with the chapter on Historical Novel with 'The Gospel of Tibet'. In 2009 he received the 'International Prize Luis Berenguer', of 'El Laberinto de la Atl√°ntida' (The Labyrinth of Atl√°ntida). In 2011 his work, 'The amazing story of gula' was named \\"Best Corporate Cookbook\\" in the Gourmand World Cookbook Awards, considered the Oscars of the culinary literature, sponsored by Gourmand International.

From 1976 to 1990, Buist was an Under Secretary in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's Overseas Development Administration. After his retirement, Buist responded to comments in the press regarding post-colonial Kenyan development.  Personal background  Buist was born to Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Powrie Buist RAMC, an Army doctor, and Christian Mary Buist, both from Dundee. In a 2008 interview with Malcolm McBain, Buist described his grandfather as \\"a brilliant mathematician, physician and obstetrician, but he subscribed to every rebel cause that he could. He was an early socialist, an atheist, a vegetarian, a eugenicist, and a promoter of Dundee's now heavily-used crematorium\\". Buist was a scholar of Winchester College. He was called up for national service, but his eyesight was too poor and he was rejected on medical grounds: instead he studied at New College, Oxford from 1948 to 1952 and got an congratulatory First in Classics. Buist was a campaigner for gay rights and joined the Campaign for Homosexual Equality (CHE) in 1972, which he saw as a less radical alternative to the Gay Liberation Front: Buist said their \\"idea of an anti- family, anti-Establishment social revolution seemed to me unlikely to produce change for the better\\". Despite being gay, Buist passed the \\"positive vetting\\" or PV process used in the Civil Service following the change of the law on homosexuality in 1967. It took until 1991 for the government to remove the automatic bar on security clearance for LGBT people. Buist's work with the CHE is part of the Hall‚ÄìCarpenter Archives at the London School of Economics. After his retirement, Buist wrote letters to The Guardian criticising the Church of England's attitudes to same-sex civil partnerships and defending Peter Mandelson against homophobic attacks in the press following the events that led to Mandelson's resignation in January 2001.

He participated in many governments under the Fourth Republic and was a proponent of Firminy Vert. He later added his pseudonym from the Resistance, \\"Claudius\\", to his name.  Early life and career  He born on May 22, 1907, in Angers and died on October 24, 1989, in Paris. The son of a railway worker, he attended primary school in his hometown and then became an apprentice and made his tour of France as a journeyman. He worked for a cabinetmaker in Paris and then joined the Rambault Furniture Company in Angers. He took courses in the hopes of becoming an art teacher. He later became anarchist in his political views and campaigned briefly in the libertarian movement. He also hosted a local union CGTU then joined after a meeting with Marc Sangnier. He joined the French Resistance under the name Claudius. In 1942, he was part of the executive committee of Free Marksman in which Peter Degon later joined. In 1943 he became a founding member of the CNR where he represented the MUR (United Movements of Resistance). He left France for London and Algiers, where he was a delegate to the Provisional Consultative Assembly. After moving back to Paris, he chaired the National Liberation Movement. He became a Companion of the Liberation, and was awarded the Croix de Guerre and the Legion of Honor.  Political career  Claudius-Petit was elected as Member of the Loire to the first and second National Constituent Assembly and the National Assembly from 1946 to 1955 under the Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance (UDSR) party. During the Fourth and the Fifth Republic, Claudius-Petit, who believed that politics was a struggle for \\"those who have nothing,\\" became one of the central figures of modernist and social centrism. Appointed Minister of Reconstruction and Urbanism September 11, 1948, he led a broad policy and planning team in France after the war that repaired the damage of the conflict and dealt with housing shortages without precedent. In February 1950, he appeared before the Council of Ministers to publish a pamphlet for national land use which is considered the founding manifesto of the policy conducted during the next half-century. To combat the excessive inequalities of settlement and activity, while balancing housing to industrial needs, Claudius-Petit advocated for a significant commitment in investment and regulation. He was then Minister of Labour and Social Security from June 19 to September 3, 1954 under the government of Pierre Mend√®s France before becoming the interim Minister of Housing from August 14 to September 3, 1954. He resigned after the rejection of the EDC. In the Ministry of Housing, he filed bills related to the acquisition of residential and industrial equipment, the procedure for codification of legislative texts concerning town planning and housing. He fought against slums. Defeated in the 1956 election, he found his seat in the National Assembly from 1958 to 1962 and from 1967 to 1978 under various centrist roles. From its inception in 1956 to 1977, he directed Sonacotra, the National Society for construction workers (Sonacotral, National Society of Algerian workers to build up the Evian agreements of 1962) Senior Manager of migrant workers' hostels in France. He was a practicing Catholic, and well respected by other members, a fact reflected on the final day of his term, December 19, 1974: \\"In conclusion, and precisely because I did not let my spiritual beliefs at the door, I can not get rid of the solidarity that binds me to the society in which I live. To obey my demands, I am with those who suffer most, with those convicted as with those who are despised the most (...) Because of that, because of him, I take my share of burden. I will fight against everything that leads to abortion, but I will vote the law\\".  Firminy-Vert  As a friend of Le Corbusier, he embarked on a massive renovation of the town of Firminy. Elected mayor in 1953, he dreamed of building next to the city, \\"a city of the twentieth century to the best of his time,\\" a kind of small Brasilia, a compendium of modern architecture. In 1955, he governed several buildings by Le Corbusier, including a house of Culture, a \\"radiant city\\", a stage and the Church of St. Peter.

Description Spinola originally thought that there were two species A. unicolor and A bicolor but we now know that these are the female and male respectively.Royal Entomogical Society of London 1934 Generic Names of British Insects British museum (Natural History) Dept. of entomology Both sexes are largely bluish black with dusky wings, but the male has a reddish-brown abdomen with a black tip. The female is about 10 mm in length. Biology Aporus unicolor is a specialised hunter in that it has only one recorded prey, the purse-web spider Atypus affinis. The female A. affinis can live for up to eight years in its subterranean silky tubular web, to which A. unicolor gains access by using its specialised enlarged fore- femur. Once in, the wasp stings the spider to paralyse it, lays an egg on her and promptly leaves the sac in which her larva develops by eating the spider. The adult wasps feed on the nectar of Umbellifers such as wild carrot, wild parsnip and rock samphire. Habitat In Great Britain this is a species where the majority of modern records are coastal, and inland records have declined probably due to habitat loss. On the coast, the habitat is typically cliffs and landslips, while inland the habitat is well-grazed downland and heathland It appears to be thermophilic and shows a strong preference for south-facing slopes and banks in sunny locations. Distribution In Great Britain A unicolor is confined to southern England from Cornwall in the west to Kent north to Cambridgeshire with recent records in South Wales and the Channel Islands. In mainland Europe A unicolor has been recorded in the western and central Europe east to Hungary and south as far as northern Italy.Global Biodiversity Information Facility Common name The common name, cutpurse, is a neologism which was the winner of a prize to name a species in The Guardian in 2012.

Current status Contracts for construction were awarded in August 2020. As of Aug 2020, enabling works were due to begin within a month. Construction of the AC Substation, and HVDC Convertor and Switching Stations, was due to start in early 2021. The subsea cable installation is expected in 2022 and 2023. Route The interconnector will start at the Upper Kergord Valley converter station in Shetland. From the converter station an underground cable will be laid to a landing area in Weisdale Voe. From there, a subsea cable will run to landfall at Noss Head in Caithness, with onward connection to an HVDC switching station north of the village of Staxigoe in Caithness. The route of the cable will cross TAT-10, TAT-14 and Atlantic Crossing 1 telecommunication cables and the Piper‚ÄìFlotta oil pipeline. Technical description The interconnector will connect to the existing 320kV Caithness - Moray Link to form a three terminal HVDC network, with converter stations at Spittal in Caithness; Blackhillock Substation in Moray; and Upper Kergord on Shetland. The Shetland leg will have a power rating of 600MW; the Spittal and Blackhillock converters are rated at 800MW and 1,200MW respectively. This will be the first multi-terminal HVDC interconnection in Europe. Project developer The project is being developed by Scottish Hydro Electric Transmission, a subsidiary of SSE plc. Project economics It is estimated that it will cost more than ¬£600 million. The project is needed for development of Shetland's renewable energy potential and it is necessary for the projects such us the Viking Wind Farm and the Aegir wave farm. It also contributes to the security of Shetland's elelctricity supply, especially as Lerwick Power Station is nearing the end of its operational life. History The project was proposed in 2007. In January 2008, the report published by the Crown Estate found the project would be \\"economically and technically possible\\". At the same year, Scottish Hydro Electric Transmission filed planning application and started public consultations. Originally, the cable was planned to run from Shetland to to Portgordon on the Scottish mainland, and then on to Blackhillock substation, near Keith, Moray via underground cable. However, the end point was moved to Caithness, and the remaining part of the connection was constructed separately as the Caithness - Moray Link. https://www.ssepd.co.uk/CaithnessHVDC/ In 2019, Ofgem announced that it was minded to authorise construction, subject to the Viking windfarm winning a CfD contract in the government auction held in September 2019. Viking Energy was unsuccessful in this auction, putting the future of the interconnector in doubt. SSEN submitted a revised proposal in January 2020. Ofgem carried out a final consultation on this revised proposal, and concluded in April 2020 that it would grant conditional approval for the link, conditional on Ofgem receiving sufficient evidence by the end of 2020 that the 457 MW Viking Wind Farm project is likely to go ahead. In April 2020, Ofgem approved revised proposals for the project, subject to \\"evidence that the Shetland Viking Wind Farm project will go ahead\\". On 17 June 2020, the Viking Wind Farm sponsor, SSE Renewables, made a final investment decision to proceed with the wind farm investment, conditional on certain industry code modifications, and \\"the outcome of the consultation on Ofgem‚Äôs minded-to position to approve the transmission link, expected in July 2020\\". According to Shetland News, this meant that both the Windfarm and the HVDC Connection \\"are likely to go ahead\\". On 16 July, Ofgem gave final approval for the connection.

It was included into the collection Novelets, Sketches and Stories by M.Stebnitsky (vol. 1, 1967) and later into the Works by N.S. Leskov (1889), in a slightly revised version. The epigraph, \\"The whole of my life has been a set of lessons, of which my death is but another one,\\" comes from the lyrical drama Lucius (–õ—é—Ü–∏–π) by Apollon Maykov (Seneka's words in part 1 of it).Bukhstab, I. The Works by N.S> Leskov in 6 volumes. Pravda Publishers, Moscow, 1973. Commentaries. Vol. I. P. 428. Synopsis Domna Platonovna, a forceful and industrious woman who seems to be in contact with half of Saint Petersburgh, is in a state of permanent war with the outside world. Supplying people with laces (the major item of her trade) but also with all kinds of services (like setting marriages, not to speak of less formal liaisons), she greatly resents people's ingratitude, as she sees it. To illustrate how badly people treat her, she tells the narrator the story of Lekanida Petrovna, a beautiful and sensitive woman who, having left her provincial husband, came to the capital hoping to find her happiness here, only to be forced into prostitution, by Domna Platonovna herself. The narrator is baffled: this 'warrior woman' is by no means vile, she's just misguided, lacking basic ideas about what's right and wrong. Curious as to what circumstances might have turned a human being (she once apparently must have been) into such a pathetic 'fat-hearted' creature, he tries to draw from her some kind of confession, but the stories she tells him about her past are comically bizarre and explain little. Some things are for certain, though: the meaning of the word \\"love\\" is totally foreign to her. And her only moral defect, as far as she is concerned, is exceptionally sound sleep. She claims there's just one sin she'd ever committed, that of having inadvertently swapped husbands with her godmother, and blames for it her sleeping habits again. Five years later the narrator, visiting a hospital, meets Domna Platonovna, who is now a nurse. She is out of her 'business', looks shabby and is on the brink of madness. It turns out that she'd fallen in love with a 21-year-old man (currently in jail for some petty crime) and gave him all of her property. She spends the next month praying, asking God to relieve her from this horrible disease, 'love'; then dies, from what seems to be \\"life force extinction.\\" Before her death she gives the narrator the last two things she's been left with, her pillow and a can of jam, to be sent to her jailed sweetheart.

It focuses on 4 branches or design disciplines: space design, product design, information design and fashion. The Museum is the result of the merging of several previous existing museums, such as the Museu de les Arts Decoratives, the Museu T√®xtil i d'Indument√†ria and the Gabinet de les Arts Gr√†fiques collection. The opening of the new headquarters, located on Pla√ßa de les Gl√≤ries, next to Torre Agbar, was set gradually during 2014.El nou Museu del Disseny obrir√† al maig del 2014 History Barcelona is a city historically linked to design, with old institutions such as the Foment de les Arts Decoratives. That is why the city of Barcelona was raised earlier in the decade of 2000 to create a single center, an integral space to allow the public to understand design in a broader consideration.Arias, Beatriz. ¬´Un espai per con√®ixer el disseny¬ª. Diari Ara (23/03/2011)(in Catalan) It was decided to build a single space in which locate all collections and endowments existing in Barcelona related to the world of design, and Oriol Bohigas commissioned the construction of a building in the Pla√ßa de les Gl√≤ries. It was originally going to be named Barcelona Design Museum, then from 2008 to 2013 it was named Design Hub Barcelona, but finally it was renamed again as Museu del Disseny de Barcelona (Design Museum of Barcelona). Goals The center is a meeting point of a network of people and institutions involved in the design world, and shares relevant information related to the sector. The aim is to encourage both research and economic activity linked to the world of design, using both own equity funds, as of this ongoing analysis of the design world.  Building Streetworks related to the Gl√≤ries building The Barcelona Design Museum is located at the DHUB building in the Pla√ßa de les Gl√≤ries. It was designed by MBM architecture firm, formed by Oriol Martorell, Oriol Bohigas and David Mackay.They were the winners of a contest organized by the City of Barcelona in 2001. The building construction started in July 2009, when the counselor of Culture Joan Manuel Tresserras and the mayor Jordi Hereu, laid the first stone.¬´Disseny Hub Barcelona¬ª. Bonart [Girona], n√∫m. 118 (agost 2009), p. 28. ISSN 1885-4389.In Catalan Construction ended in 2013, and the Design Museum of Barcelona opened its doors in 2014. The building consists of two parts: an underground one (using the level change caused by the urbanization of the Glories square) and one that emerges 14.50 meters above the ground. The latter is a parallelepiped bias cut with the same width as the Avila Street, acting as an indicator of the relationship between the Eixample streets and the Gl√≤ries square, without affecting the view of the large central park. The cover of the subway is a public space linked to the future project of the Pla√ßa de les Gl√≤ries park. The green carpet is one of the important components and it is made with natural or artificial elements to ensure sustainability and easy maintenance. It includes a bar and restaurant, offering an attractive public space. The lake acts as a compositional emphasis relating the various levels. ; Ground Floor: Includes two floors and a mezzanine, denser activities, such as main exhibition hall, reservations, research and teaching, well-attended services, etc. Natural lighting and the relationship with the outside, despite being a basement, is achieved through the pit produced by the difference of levels, reinforced sheet water reflecting a kind of large forecourt. This lighting is reinforced with six skylights that emerge in the public and may be used as showcases for the contents and activities of the Centre. ; First Floor: According to planning, it uses the minimum floor area in order not to reduce the space for public use. Cantilever extends into the square, allowing the planned building area. The set of the two bodies that make up the center enters through a single hall with double access: +7 m level., From Avila Street, and at +14.5 m., From the square. This hall is a kind of street or public place, public or semi-almost a must to relate the square of the Glories, the Poblenou and metro and the exchanger. From this square an set of stairs, escalators and elevators reach all the services located in the basement and all the upper floors of various dimensions and characteristics, up to the conference room. The exterior of the building uses only two materials: metal plates (zinc or aluminum) and glass, so that, together, have an industrial look with metallic reflections. ; Sustainability The entire project involves a high degree of environmental quality, sustainability and energy sufficiency. It may indicate the most important chapters: passive sustainability (material and structure of massive facades and finestram, storage and processing, pre-engineered systems, shading and insulation, etc., Within the criteria of Distinctive Guarantee environmental quality of the Generalitat and the EU Ecolabel), sanitation (separative network to reuse rainwater), plumbing (minimum consumption control and regulation of flows, solar collectors for hot water production for a minimum of 70%), air conditioning (water chillers for air condensed high performance, low noise and acoustic protection, heat recovery chiller plants, natural gas boilers, free cooling when outdoor conditions permit, latent heat recovery in the extraction of air), electricity (low power, presence detectors, testers timed, photovoltaic panels for direct use of solar power), centralized management of all facilities.MBM Architects. Specification of the project 2001 Museums The Barcelona Design Museum is the result of merging several previously existing local museums: =Museu de les Arts Decoratives= The Museu de les Arts Decoratives was a museum created in 1932. This historic museum contains a rich and diverse collection of European decorative arts, from the Middle Ages to the Industrial Revolution. In 1995, the museum extended its boundaries with the incorporation of design, thus converting it into the first and only statewide museum concerned with the preservation and exhibition of Spanish industrial design. The collections of the Museu de les Arts Decoratives were created from an important resource of industrial design and decorative art objects, that included salvers, carriages, furniture, wallpaper, clocks, tapestries and glasswork. =Museu T√®xtil i d'Indument√†ria= The Museu T√®xtil i d'Indument√†ria possesses countless objects and pieces of major artistic and historical value that make up their collections of garments, fabrics and jewellery. Regarding their collection of clothes, the museum allows you to take a journey through the history of textiles, from the 16th century right up to the modern day. The museum‚Äôs collections include Coptic, Hispano-Arab, Gothic and Renaissance fabrics, as well as embroidery, a section on lacework and a collection of prints. Also worth mentioning is the jewelry collection, comprising approximately five hundred pieces that were made and produced in Spain. =Gabinet de les Arts Gr√†fiques= The Gabinet de les Arts Gr√†fiques, a Cabinet of Graphic Arts, was a museum dedicated to visual communication design. The collections of the museum bring together significant samples of typography such as punches, matrices and tracing plates, as well as, prints that include samples of binding, packaging, labels and posters. Important printers such as; Elzeviriana, Bobes, Seix Barral and Tobella, Naips Comas (the makers of playing cards), Tallers Roca (the industrial bookbinders) and the Neufville type foundry, have contributed to the museum‚Äôs expanding resources. In addition, certain artists and their families, have also donated graphic works and engraving moulds ‚Äì as is the case of Miquel Plana and the families of Josep Obiols and Miquel Llovet. The collection is presented during exhibitions and study galleries programmed by Disseny Hub Barcelona.Wallpaper exhibit The concept that initiated the Study Galleries was to create an area that combines the ideas of a temporary exhibition, a documentation centre and a museum repository but that has its own identity. Various objects are assembled according to their typologies and presented in a way that allows visitors to study, contemplate and reflect upon the museums collections. =The Casa Bloc Apartment Museum= Casa Bloc. The Room 1/11 of the Casa Bloc (1932‚Äì1939) (in Catalan, Block house) is an apartment-museum run by the Design Museum of Barcelona. Inside you can visit the structure and the original look of the floor of this architectural complex, a reference architecture worker housing at the time of the Second Spanish Republic. The opening of this museum floor space as a tribute to the work of Josep Llu√≠s Sert Josep Torres Clav√© and Joan Baptista Subirana and innovation that its approach assumed the 1930s. The Casa Bloc is open to everyone, with a regime of guided tours by reservation, from March 2012. Room 1/11 is a duplex measuring 60 square meters. It is located in Block 2, Level 1, Gate 11. The internal layout is very simple and clearly differentiates the day and the night. Documentation center The Museum also hosts a library dedicated to the greater areas in the world of design: product, fashion, information and interior design. The initial bibliographic reserves contains over 9,000 published documents dating from the 16th century to the present day. And 1,600 of those dating from before 1950. The reserve originated in the old libraries of the Museus T√®xtil i d'Indument√†ria de Barcelona and the Museu d'Arts Decoratives de Barcelona, the Gabinet de les Arts Gr√†fiques de Barcelona and the BCD (Barcelona Centre de Disseny). These sources have received numerous donations over the years by professionals, individuals, institutions and businesses. Particularly noteworthy for their uniqueness and excellent state of preservation, the bibliographic reserves of the Museu T√®xtil i d'Indument√†ria are made up largely of two very large donations: the bequest of the Comtesa de Vilardaga and the donation by Sr. Manuel Rocamora. The majority of the bibliographic reserves can be found in the reading room and are accessible to the public. It has developed its own classification system: IMAG. The most valuable documents, the oldest and those that are referred to the least, can be found in a deposit in the DHUB building. The Documentation center uses RFID technology (Radio Frequency Identification) to keep track of the number of consults each document receives. With this information, the documents that are the most in demand are always located in the reading room for ease of access. The historic reserves of magazines and journals are still being catalogued. The centre keeps over 100 subscriptions to specialist magazines and journals. =Archives= The archives of the documentation center currently include: * ADI FAD Archive. Collection of the reserves of the Associaci√≥ de Dissenyadors Industrials del Foment de les Arts Decoratives (1957‚Äì2007) It contents documentation generated by the association in its everyday activities, being of work or management. Includes documentation related to its administration(foundational acts, meetings, members, reports, participation in international entities‚Ä¶), information management (archives, computer system‚Ä¶), external relations (public acts, relations with other private and public institutions‚Ä¶), human resources management, financial resources management, heritage management (movable and real state items), legal issues, promotion of industrial design (exhibitions, conferences, publications‚Ä¶) and services to the members (distribution lists, labour exchange, bulletins‚Ä¶) * Rigalt i Granell Archive. The Archive is made up of documents collected from the stained-glass workshop Rigalt, Granell & Cia and is a testimony to the work of this centenarian workshop that was in operation from 1890 until 1984. Until now, the documentation from the stained-glass workshop Rigalt, Granell & Cia. was being preserved by the Granell family. The archive consists of diverse information about the artistic and technical aspects of the workshop whose work was central to the modernist period. Their work can be found at the Palau de la M√∫sica Catalana, the Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau and the Casa Lle√≥ Morera, among others. The company worked with architects including Llu√≠s Dom√®nech i Montaner, Llu√≠s Moncunill, Josep Puig i Cadafalch and Geroni Granell. The documentation is a testimony to the work of this centenarian workshop that was in operation from 1890 until 1984. Rigalt, Granell & Cia. faced many challenges throughout this period, which, while it always remained in the hands of the Granell family, included changes to its founding members. In this archive you can find accounting documents, drawings, sketches, inventories, publicity catalogues and photos from the stained-glass workshop. The largest number of documents that have been preserved are 500 sketches that include drawings of stained-glass and acid-etched glass. Thanks to these drawings, we can follow the artistic trends in stained-glass over the last 100 years. Included are drawings from the pre-modernist, modernist, noucentista, art deco, and works that reflect the abstract tendencies of the 80s. The donation comprises a total of 3,000 pieces, including prints (from different countries), diverse themed plates, brochures, business directories (among which include Les Vitraux de Paris (c.1900), Aus der Deutschen Glasmalerei de Berlin (1901) and Religi√∂se Malerein f√ºr Kirchedekoration de Viena (1907), company photographs and folders with original drawings and sketches. * Montaner y Sim√≥n editors collection. =Databases= It offers its users some of the best specialized databases available. Requests and consultations should be carried out at the centre's facilities. * Design and Applied Arts Index (DAAI) allows for the consultation of summaries of published articles from design publications dating back to 1973. It covers a wide variety of disciplines: Ceramics, glass, furniture, jewelry, graphic design, fashion design, textile design, interior design, architecture, web design, etc. It includes approximately 1200 new records every month. * Berg Fashion Library is an online resource that provides integrated access to visual and textual content on clothing and fashion throughout history. It includes the Berg Encyclopedia of World Dress and Fashion, a collection of electronic books, dictionaries and other reference resources, as well as, an extensive image bank.

Geography  Pepin Island is long, and up to wide. It measures in area. The highest point is Stuart Hill, which rises to . The island is located on the northeast coast of Tasman Bay, with the smaller indentation of Delaware Bay to the east. It is joined to the mainland by a naturally formed pathway made from boulders that have tumbled down nearby hillsides then been shaped into a causeway by the sea.  History  Historian John Mitchell said the NgƒÅti Tama and other iwi came into the area from the 1820s, and that part of the island was once the pƒÅ of the paramount chief of Tama, Te P≈´oho-o-te-rangi, but that it left NgƒÅti Tama control around 1880. The island was named by the French explorer Jules Dumont d'Urville after his wife, Ad√®le P√©pin. In 1996, the island was bought by the German businesswoman Dr Viola von Hohenzollern (n√©e Hallman) for NZ$2 million. When von Hohenzollern bought the island, it was overgrazed, run down, and had many wild goats that prevent the growth of native bush. Her farm manager improved the situation by planting trees, fencing and pest control. Von Hohenzollern and farm manager Andrew Newton won a top Nelson Tasman Environmental award in 2011 for their custodianship. In December 2012, von Hohenzollern died and Pepin Island was inherited by her daughter, Olivia Hallman. The new owner has introduced public open days, and the second one was run in May 2015, which attracted over 1,000 people and was again a fundraiser for the Hira Volunteer Fire Force.  Proposed sale  In late 2018, the island went on sale, with an asking price of $NZ16 million. Nelson mayor Rachel Reese expressed interest that the island be locally owned.

It was originally the residence of Yue Zhongqi (Â≤≥ÈçæÁê™), (a descendant of Yue Fei), the Minister of Defence (ÂÖµÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏) and Governor-General of Shanxi and Gansu provinces during the reign of the Yongzheng Emperor in the Qing dynasty. Ji Yun (Ji Xiaolan) lived at this address for two periods of his life: from the age of 11 to 39, and again from the age of 48 to 82, totalling about 60 years. Yuewei Cottage () is a nickname for the residence given by Ji Xiaolan himself. He wrote Fantastic Tales By Ji Xiaolan at this residence. In volume 15, Lend An Ear to Something Without Taking It Seriously, he wrote: \\"Hufang bridge used to be the residence of Weixing Gong (Yue Zhongqi). There is a stone, about seven or eight feet in height, lying in the east of the site. It is said that the stone was a gift from the Yongzheng Emperor when he began to construct the house. It was transported from Tuer mountain. It holds pride of place among all the Taihu stones in Nancheng, hence I am called The Old Man of the Lonely Stone.\\" The original Taihu stones of Yuewei Cottage were sent back to Tuer Mountain, in Yingtai, Zhongnanhai. Evolution and current situation A horizontal inscribed board reading \\"Yuewei Cottage\\" was hung over the door of the north room in the original east courtyard of Yuewei Cottage, but later it was taken away by people working in Zhili Guild Hall.more information about Zhili Guild Hall In the courtyard, Chaenomeles speciosa (the flowering quince) and wisteria planted by Ji Xiaolan himself still flourish today, producing a remarkable floral aroma in spring. Ji Xiaolan once wrote in Fantastic Tales By Ji Xiaolan that \\"The wisteria is still there. It can be supported only by the wood which is used as pillars. Its shade covers the central room yard. Its vines have spread to other places and cover the west study room yard. When it blooms, the flowers hang down to the ground like purple clouds, overwhelming people with their fragrance.\\" After Ji Xiaolan's death, the residence has changed hands many times. Notable figures such as Zhili Huiguan, Mei Lanfang, Zhang Boju,more information about Zhang Boju Xiao Changhua,more information about Xiao Changhua Liu Shaobai and many others have all been owners of the estate at various time. Mei Lanfang also once established the National Opera Association and the Spreading and Learning Site of National Opera here. In the 1950s, it became a Communist Party school in Xuanwu District, Beijing. In October, 1959, a Shanxi cuisine restaurant, namely Jinyang Restaurant, opened for business here with the help of Peng Zhen, then the mayor of Beijing. Because it was the residence of Ji Xiaolan, many men of letters gathered there to admire the vines, including Lao She, Zang Kejia and Cao Yu. Moreover, the residence has proven popular with a lot of international visitors, who come to experience its artistic atmosphere. George Herbert Walker Bush, the former president of the U.S.A, George P. Shultz and Colin Powell, two American Secretaries of State as well as other notable figures have dined there, tasting the characteristic crispy fried duck. In 1986, the restaurant was enrolled as a Major Site Protected for Its Historical and Cultural Value at the National Level in Xuanwu District (now merged into Xicheng District). In 2000, during the reconstruction of Liangguang Road in Beijing, the Former Residence of Ji Xiaolan was slated for demolition. However, after the protest from experts and appeals to the public, the construction plans were revised to avoid it. At the beginning of 2002, Jinyang Restaurant moved to a hall at the east side from the residence's yard. The government invested in the reconstruction of the residence and officially opened to the public. In the year 2003, the Former Residence of Ji Xiaolan was added to the list of Major Site Protected for Its Historical and Cultural Value at the National Level of Beijing.

It contains a single species, Kenyasaurus mariakaniensis. Discovery Kenyasaurus is known only from the holotype specimen, KNM-MA1, a well preserved and partially complete postcranial skeleton, lacking much of the neck, pectoral girdle and forelimb, which is hosted at the Kenya National Museum. It was found at the Mariakani locality which is located 25 miles from Mombasa, southeastern Kenya. It was collected from the upper part of the Maji ya Chumvi Beds (Maji-Ya-Chumvi Formation). These beds form the lower part of the Middle Duruma Sandstone Series (Duruma Group) and on the basis of lithological similarities with beds in Tanzania and Madagascar were dated to the Induan and Olenekian stages of the Early Triassic period, about 251.0-245 million years ago. This specimen represents the only reptilian fossils currently known from these beds. Description Kenyasaurus is a relatively small, lightly built, general lizard-like form. In Kenyasaurus original description, Harris and Carroll (1977) assigned it to the \\"Eosuchia\\" (a defunct clade that used to unit all diapsids more advanced than Araeoscelis) on the basis of its well developed sternum and that the fifth distal tarsal is not a separate element, but the fifth metatarsal is not hooked. It was considered to be most closely related to the aquatic eosuchians Tangasaurus and Hovasaurus (from Tanzania and Madagascar) based on its small size and general body proportions. Harris and Carroll noted that its tail is not specialized as a swimming organ as it is in tangasaurids. Philip J. Currie (1982) redescribed Tangasaurus and its relationships with other \\"eosuchians\\". He diagnosed Kenyasaurus on the basis of five autapomorphies: It possesses low but anteroposteriorly elongate neural spines in the dorsal region, 56 caudal vertebrae and 28 pairs of caudal ribs and transverse processes. Its astragalus is almost triangular rather than primitive L-shape and it has pronounced process on fifth metatarsal for insertion of peroneus brevis. Currie (1982) united two subfamilies within the Tangasauridae: Kenyasaurinae (that he named to include Kenyasaurus and Thadeosaurus, both are thought to be terrestrial) and Tangasaurinae (to include the aquatic Tangasaurus and Hovasaurus). He allied Tangasauridae and Youngina together within superfamily Younginoidea which he named. Currie (1980) named Acerosodontosaurus, and allied it with Younginoidea in the clade Younginiformes. Currie's (1982) classification of the Younginiformes had been accepted by many scientists before they could perform large and computerized analyses. More recent works that use phylogenetic analyses usually suggest that neither Younginoidea nor Younginiformes are monophyletic. Constanze Bickelmann, Johannes M√ºller and Robert R. Reisz (2009) redescribed Acerosodontosaurus and suggested an aquatic lifestyle for it. Their analysis is figured below, and it found support for two distinct families within \\"Younginiformes\\": the aquatic Tangasauridae, and the terrestrial Younginidae (in partial polytomy with Tangasauridae). However, they found no support for the inclusion of Kenyasaurus within any of those families. More resolved results were obtained by Reisz et al. (2011) in their description of Orovenator. However, those results required the exclusion of the fragmentary taxa Galesphyrus, Kenyasaurus, Palaeagama and Saurosternon from their analysis. Etymology Kenyasaurus was first described and named by John M. Harris and Robert L. Carroll in 1977 and the type species is Kenyasaurus mariakaniensis. The generic name is derived from the name of the Kenya in which the only known specimen was found, and Greek sauros, meaning \\"lizard\\". The specific name is derived from the name of the type locality of the genus, Mariakani.

Apart from liquids, LFV can also be used to measure the velocity of solid materials as well as for detection of micro-defects in their structures. A Lorentz force velocimetry system is called Lorentz force flowmeter (LFF). A LFF measures the integrated or bulk Lorentz force resulting from the interaction between a liquid metal in motion and an applied magnetic field. In this case the characteristic length of the magnetic field is of the same order of magnitude as the dimensions of the channel. It must be addressed that in the case where localized magnetic fields are used, it is possible to perform local velocity measurements and thus the term Lorentz force velocimeter is used. Introduction The use of magnetic fields in flow measurement date back to 19th century, when in 1832 Michael Faraday attempted to determine the velocity of the River Thames. Faraday applied a method in which a flow (the river flow) is exposed to a magnetic field (earth magnetic field) and the induced voltage is measured using two electrodes across the same flow. This method is the basis of the one of the most successful commercial applications in flow metering known as the inductive flowmeter. The theory of such devices has been developed and comprehensively summarized by Prof. J. A. ShercliffArthur J. Shercliff: Theory of Electromagnetic Flow Measurement. Cambridge University Press, . in early 1950s. While inductive flowmeters are widely used for flow measurement in fluids at room temperatures such as beverages, chemicals and waste water, they are not suited for flow measurement of media such as hot, aggressive or for local measurements where surrounding obstacles limit access to the channel or pipe. Since they require electrodes to be inserted into the fluid, their use is limited to applications at temperatures far below the melting points of practically relevant metals. The Lorentz force velocimetry was invented by the A. Shercliff. However, it did not find practical application in these early years up until recent technical advances; in manufacturing of rare earth and non rare-earth strong permanent magnets, accurate force measurement techniques, multiphysical process simulation software for magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) problems that this principle could be turned into a feasible working flow measurement technique. LFV is currently being developed for applications in metallurgy as well as in other areas. Based on theory introduced by Shercliff there have been several attempts to develop flow measurement methods which do not require any mechanical contact with the fluid,. Among them is the eddy current flowmeter which measures flow- induced changes in the electric impedance of coils interacting with the flow. More recently, a non-contact method was proposed in which a magnetic field is applied to the flow and the velocity is determined from measurements of flow- induced deformations of the applied magnetic field,. Principle and physical interpretation The principle of Lorentz force velocimetry is based on measurements of the Lorentz force that occurs due to the flow of a conductive fluid under the influence of a variable magnetic field. According to Faraday's law, when a metal or conductive fluid moves through a magnetic field, eddy currents generate there by electromotive force in zones of maximal magnetic field gradient (in the present case in the inlet and outlet zones). Eddy current in its turn creates induced magnetic field according to Amp√®re's law. The interaction between eddy currents and total magnetic field gives rise to Lorentz force that breaks the flow. By virtue of Newton's third law \\"actio=reactio\\" a force with the same magnitude but opposite direction acts upon its source - permanent magnet. Direct measurement of the magnet's reaction force allows to determine fluid's velocity, since this force is proportional to flow rate. The Lorentz force used in LFV has nothing to do with magnetic attraction or repulsion. It is only due to the eddy currents whose strength depends on the electrical conductivity, the relative velocity between the liquid and the permanent magnet as well as the magnitude of the magnetic field. So, when a liquid metal moves across magnetic field lines, the interaction of the magnetic field (which are either produced by a current- carrying coil or by a permanent magnet) with the induced eddy currents leads to a Lorentz force (with density \\\\vec{f} = \\\\vec{j} \\\\times \\\\vec{B} ) which brakes the flow. The Lorentz force density is roughly f \\\\sim \\\\sigma v B^2 where \\\\sigma is the electrical conductivity of the fluid, v its velocity, and B the magnitude of the magnetic field. This fact is well known and has found a variety of applications. This force is proportional to the velocity and conductivity of the fluid, and its measurement is the key idea of LFV. With the recent advent of powerful rare earth permanent magnets (like NdFeB, SmCo and other kind of magnets) and tools for designing sophisticated systems by permanent magnet the practical realization of this principle has now become possible. The primary magnetic field \\\\vec{B}\\\\left(\\\\vec{r}\\\\right) can be produced by a permanent magnet or a primary current \\\\vec{J}\\\\left(\\\\vec{r}\\\\right) (see Fig. 1). The motion of the fluid under the action of the primary field induces eddy currents which are sketched in figure 3. They will be denoted by \\\\vec{j}\\\\left(\\\\vec{r}\\\\right) and are called secondary currents. The interaction of the secondary current with the primary magnetic field is responsible for the Lorentz force within the fluid \\\\vec{F}_f = \\\\int _f \\\\vec{j} \\\\times \\\\vec{B} d^3\\\\vec{r} which breaks the flow. The secondary currents create a magnetic field \\\\vec{b}\\\\left(\\\\vec{r}\\\\right), the secondary magnetic field. The interaction of the primary electric current with the secondary magnetic field gives rise to the Lorentz force on the magnet system \\\\vec{F}_m = \\\\int _m \\\\vec{J} \\\\times \\\\vec{b} d^3\\\\vec{r} The reciprocity principle for the Lorentz force velocimetry states that the electromagnetic forces on the fluid and on the magnet system have the same magnitude and act in opposite direction, namely \\\\vec{F}_m = - \\\\vec{F}_f The general scaling law that relates the measured force to the unknown velocity can be derived with reference to the simplified situation shown in Fig. 2. Here a small permanent magnet with dipole moment m is located at a distance L above a semi-infinite fluid moving with uniform velocity v parallel to its free surface. Fig. 2 : Spatial distribution of magnetic fields in Lorentz force velocimetry: (a) primary magnetic field \\\\vec{B} and eddy currents \\\\vec{J} produced by a magnetic dipole interacting with a uniformly moving electrically conducting fluid; (b) secondary magnetic field \\\\vec{b} due to the horizontal eddy currents \\\\vec{J} . Adapted from. The analysis that leads to the scaling relation can be made quantitative by assuming that the magnet is a point dipole with dipole moment \\\\vec{m} = m \\\\hat{e}_z whose magnetic field is given by \\\\vec{B} \\\\left( \\\\vec{R}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{\\\\mu _0}{4 \\\\pi} \\\\left\\\\lbrace 3 \\\\frac{\\\\left( \\\\vec{m} \\\\cdot \\\\vec{R} \\\\right) \\\\vec{R} }{ R^5} - \\\\frac{\\\\vec{m}}{R^3} \\\\right\\\\rbrace where \\\\vec{R} = \\\\vec{r} - L \\\\hat{e} _z and R = \\\\mid \\\\vec{R} \\\\mid . Assuming a velocity field \\\\vec{v} = v \\\\hat{e} _x for z < 0 , the eddy currents can be computed from Ohm's law for a moving electrically conducting fluid \\\\vec{J} = \\\\sigma \\\\left( - abla \\\\phi + \\\\vec{v} \\\\times \\\\vec{B} \\\\right) subject to the boundary conditions J_z=0 at z=0 and J_z \\\\to 0 as z \\\\to 1. First, the scalar electric potential is obtained as \\\\phi \\\\left( \\\\vec{r} \\\\right) = - \\\\frac{\\\\mu_0 v m}{4 \\\\pi} \\\\frac{x}{R^3} from which the electric current density is readily calculated. They are indeed horizontal. Once they are known, the Biot‚ÄìSavart law can be used to compute the secondary magnetic field \\\\vec{b} \\\\left( \\\\vec{r}\\\\right) . Finally, the force is given by \\\\vec{F} = \\\\left( \\\\vec{m} \\\\cdot abla \\\\right) \\\\vec{b} where the gradient of \\\\vec{b} has to be evaluated at the location of the dipole. For the problem at hand all these steps can be carried out analytically without any approximation leading to the result F = \\\\frac{\\\\mu_0^2 \\\\sigma v m^2}{128 \\\\pi L^3}\\\\hat{e}_z This provides us with the estimate F \\\\sim \\\\mu_0^2 \\\\sigma v m^2 L^{-3}  Conceptual setups  Lorentz force flowmeters are usually classified in several main conceptual setups. Some of them designed as static flowmeters where the magnet system is at rest and one measures the force acting on it. Alternatively, they can be designed as rotary flowmeters where the magnets are arranged on a rotating wheel and the spinning velocity is a measure of the flow velocity. Obviously, the force acting on a Lorentz force flowmeter depends both on the velocity distribution and on the shape of the magnet system. This classification depends on the relative direction of the magnetic field that is being applied respect to the direction of the flow. In Figure 3 one can distinguish diagrams of the longitudinal and the transverse Lorentz force flowmeters. Fig. 3 : Principle sketch of Lorentz force velocimetry: arrangement of the coil (a) and structure of the primary magnetic field (b) for a longitudinal flux flowmeter. (c, d) Same for a transverse flux flowmeter. Adapted from. It is important to mention that even that in figures only a coil or a magnet are sketched, the principle holds for both. Rotary LFF consists of a freely rotating permanent magnet (or an array of magnets mounted on a flywheel as shown in figure 4), which is magnetized perpendicularly to the axle it is mounted on. When such a system is placed close to a duct carrying an electrically conducting fluid flow, it rotates so that the driving torque due to the eddy currents induced by the flow is balanced by the braking torque induced by the rotation itself. The equilibrium rotation rate varies directly with the flow velocity and inversely with the distance between the magnet and the duct. In this case it is possible to measure either the torque on the magnet system or the angular velocity at which the wheel spins. Fig. 4 : A simplified sketch of the rotary LFV. Adapted from.  Practical applications  LFV is sought to be extended to all fluid or solid materials, providing that they are electrical conductors. As shown before, the Lorentz force generated by the flow depend linearly on the conductivity of the fluid. Typically, the electrical conductivity of molten metals is of the order of 10^6 ~ S/m so the Lorentz force is in the range of some mN. However, equally important liquids as glass melts and electrolytic solutions have a conductivity of \\\\sim ~ 1 ~ S/m giving rise to a Lorentz force of the order of micronewtons or even smaller. = High Conducting media: liquid or solid metals = Among different possibilities to measure the effect on the magnet system, it has been successfully applied those based on the measurement of the deflection of a parallel spring under an applied force. Firstly using a strain gauge and then recording the deflection of a quartz spring with an interferometer, in whose case the deformation is detected to within 0.1 nm. = Low Conducting media: Electrolytic solution or glass melts = Recent advance in LFV made it possible for metering flow velocity of media which has very low electroconductivity, particularly by varying parameters as well as using some state-of-art force measurement devices enable to measure flow velocity of electrolyte solutions with conductivity that is 106 times smaller than that for the liquid metals. There are variety of industrial and scientific applications where noncontact flow measurement through opaque walls or in opaque liquids is desirable. Such applications include flow metering of chemicals, food, beverages, blood, aqueous solutions in the pharmaceutical industry, molten salts in solar thermal power plants, and high temperature reactors as well as glass melts for high-precision optics.U. Lange and H. Loch, \\"Instabilities and stabilization of glass pipe flow\\" in Mathematical Simulation in Glass Technology, Schott Series on Glass and Glass Ceramics, edited by D. Krause and H. Loch (Springer Verlag, 2002) A noncontact flowmeter is a device that is neither in mechanical contact with the liquid nor with the wall of the pipe in which the liquid flows. Noncontact flowmeters are equally useful when walls are contaminated like in the processing of radioactive materials, when pipes are strongly vibrating or in cases when portable flowmeters are to be developed. If the liquid and the wall of the pipe are transparent and the liquid contains tracer particles, optical measurement techniques,C. Tropea, A. L. Yarin, and J. F. Foss, Handbook of Experimental Fluid Mechanics, Springer-Verlag, GmbH, 2007F. Durst, A. Melling, and J. H. Whitelaw, Principles and Practice of Laser-Doppler Anemometry, 2nd ed. Academic, London, 1981 are effective enough tool to perform noncontact measurements. However, if either the wall or the liquid are opaque as is often the case in food production, chemical engineering, glass making, and metallurgy, very few possibilities for noncontact flow measurement exist. The force measurement system is an important part of the Lorentz force velocimetry. With high resolution force measurement system makes the measurement of even lower conductivity possible. Up to date has the force measurement system continually being developed. At first the pendulum-like setups was used (Figure 5). One of the experimental facilities consists of two high power (410 mT) magnets made of NdFeB suspended by thin wires on both side of channel thereby creating magnetic field perpendicular to the fluid flow, here deflection is measured by interferometer system,. The second setup consists of state-of-art weighting balance system (Figure 6) from which is being hanged optimized magnets on the base of Halbach array system. While the total mass of both magnet systems are equal (1 kg), this system induces 3 times higher system response due to arrangement of individual elements in the array and it's interaction with predefined fluid profile. Here use of very sensitive force measuring devices is desirable, since flow velocity is being converted from the very tiny detected Lorentz Force. This force in combination with unavoidable dead weight F_G of the magnet ( F_G = m\\\\cdot g ) is around F/F_G = 10^{-7} . After that, the method of differential force measurement was developed. With this method two balance were used, one with magnet and the other is with same-weight-dummy. In this way the influence of environment would be reduced. Recently, it have been reported that the flow measurements by this method is possible for saltwater flows whose electrical conductivity is as small as 0.06 S/m (range of electrical conductivity of the regular water from tap).

Adapted from = Lorentz force sigmometry = Fig. 8 : LOFOS working principle. Lorentz force sigmometry (LOFOS) is a contactless method for measuring the thermophysical properties of materials, no matter whether it is a fluid or a solid body. The precise measurements of electrical value, density, viscosity, thermal conductivity and surface tension of molten metals are in great importance in industry applications. One of the major problems in the experimental measurements of the thermophysical properties at high temperature (>1000 K) in the liquid state is the problem of chemical reaction between the hot fluid and the electrical probes. The basic equation for calculating the electrical conductivity is derived from the equation that links the mass flow rate \\\\dot{m} and Lorentz force F generated by magnetic field in flow: \\\\dot{m} \\\\left(t \\\\right) = \\\\frac{K}{\\\\Sigma} F \\\\left(t \\\\right) \\\\quad where \\\\Sigma = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{\\\\rho} is the specific electrical conductivity equals to the ratio of the electrical conductivity \\\\sigma and the mass density of fluid \\\\rho . K is a calibration factor that depends on the geometry of the LOFOS system. From equation above the cumulative mass during operating time is determined as M=\\\\int _{t1}^{t2} \\\\dot{m} \\\\left(t \\\\right) dt = \\\\frac{K}{\\\\Sigma} \\\\int _{t1}^{t2} F \\\\left(t \\\\right) dt = \\\\frac{K}{\\\\Sigma} \\\\tilde{F} \\\\quad , where \\\\tilde{F} is the integral of Lorentz force within the time process. From this equation and considering the specific electrical conductivity formula, one can derive the final equation to compute the electrical conductivity for the fluid, in the form \\\\sigma = \\\\rho K \\\\frac{\\\\tilde{F}}{M} \\\\quad . = Time-of-flight Lorentz force velocimetry = Fig. 9 : Time-of- flight working principle. Taken from Time-of-flight Lorentz force velocimetry, is intended for contactless determination of flow rate in conductive fluids. It can be successfully used even in case when such material properties as electrical conductivity or density are not precisely known under specific outer conditions. The last reason makes time-of-flight LFV especially important for industry application. According to time-of-flight LFV (Fig. 9) two coherent measurement systems are mounted on a channel one by one. The measurement is based on getting of cross-correlating function of signals, which are registered by two magnetic measurement's system. Every system consists of permanent magnet and force sensor, so inducing of Lorentz force and measurement of the reaction force are made simultaneously. Any cross- correlation function is useful only in case of qualitative difference between signals and for creating the difference in this case turbulent fluctuations are used. Before reaching of measurement zone of a channel liquid passes artificial vortex generator that induces strong disturbances in it. And when such fluctuation-vortex reaches magnetic field of measurement system we can observe a peak on its force-time characteristic while second system still measures stable flow. Then according to the time between peaks and the distance between measurement system observer can estimate mean velocity and, hence, flow rate of the liquid by equation: Q_{flow} = k \\\\frac{D}{\\\\tau} where D is the distance between magnet system, \\\\tau the time delay between recorded peaks, and k is obtained experimentally for every specific liquid, as shown in figure 9.  Lorentz force eddy current testing  Fig. 10 : LET working principle. Adapted from M. Zec et al., Fast Technique for Lorentz Force Calculations in Nondestructive Testing Applications, COMPUMAG 2013, Budapest, Hungary A different, albeit physically closely related challenge is the detection of deeply lying flaws and inhomogeneities in electrically conducting solid materials. In the traditional version of eddy current testing an alternating (AC) magnetic field is used to induce eddy currents inside the material to be investigated. If the material contains a crack or flaw which make the spatial distribution of the electrical conductivity nonuniform, the path of the eddy currents is perturbed and the impedance of the coil which generates the AC magnetic field is modified. By measuring the impedance of this coil, a crack can hence be detected. Since the eddy currents are generated by an AC magnetic field, their penetration into the subsurface region of the material is limited by the skin effect. The applicability of the traditional version of eddy current testing is therefore limited to the analysis of the immediate vicinity of the surface of a material, usually of the order of one millimeter. Attempts to overcome this fundamental limitation using low frequency coils and superconducting magnetic field sensors have not led to widespread applications. A recent technique, referred to as Lorentz force eddy current testing (LET), exploits the advantages of applying DC magnetic fields and relative motion providing deep and relatively fast testing of electrically conducting materials. In principle, LET represents a modification of the traditional eddy current testing from which it differs in two aspects, namely (i) how eddy currents are induced and (ii) how their perturbation is detected. In LET eddy currents are generated by providing the relative motion between the conductor under test and a permanent magnet (see figure 10). If the magnet is passing by a defect, the Lorentz force acting on it shows a distortion whose detection is the key for the LET working principle. If the object is free of defects, the resulting Lorentz force remains constant.  Advantages & Limitations  The advantages of LFV are * LFV is a non-contact techniques of flow rate measurement. * LFV can be successfully applied for aggressive and high-temperature fluids like liquid metals. * Mean flow rate or mean velocity of fluid can be obtained without depending on flow's inhomogeneities and zones of turbulence. The limitations of the LFV are * Necessity of temperature control of measurement system because of strong dependence of magnet's magnetic field on temperature. High temperature could cause irretrievable loss of the magnetic properties of permanent magnet (Curie temperature). * Restriction of measurement zone by permanent magnet's dimensions. * Necessity of liquid level's control in case of work with open channel. * Rapid decay of the magnetic fields give rise to tiny forces on the magnet system.

Ramon Airport is the second largest in Israel (after Ben Gurion Airport) and has replaced the former Eilat Airport and Ovda Airport for civilian traffic. It also serves as the primary diversion airport in Israel. The airport is located north of Eilat, next to Be'er Ora. Unlike the previous airport in Eilat, it has ample ramp space and a longer runway, which allows large aircraft to land and park. The airport was originally due to open in April 2017, but was pushed back and opened on January 21, 2019. The Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair inaugurated first international flight service Boeing 737-800 from Poznan, Poland on March 4, 2019.http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-new-eilat-airport-to-open- april-2016-1001215366 History =Background= Eilat Airport was established in 1949, when most of what would later be Eilat was empty. As the city developed, much of it was built around the airport. In the 1994 Peace Agreement between Israel and Jordan it was decided that operations would be transferred from Eilat Airport to Aqaba Airport. The original plan was to rename Aqaba Airport as Aqaba‚ÄìEilat Peace International Airport. The agreement was never carried out, and an agreement between the two countries in March 1997, stipulated that domestic flights would continue to use Eilat Airport, whilst no further action to move international flights took place. Removing the Eilat Airport from the city center was considered necessary for further development of Eilat, as it would allow, among other things, the construction of additional hotels close to the shoreline. It would also reduce noise pollution. The project is part of a larger plan to develop the city, which includes mega-projects such as moving the Port of Eilat to a location near the Jordanian border (for which removing the original airport is necessary), the Railway to Eilat, and upgrading the Arava Road. The airport is named in memory of the first Israeli astronaut Ilan Ramon, who perished in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, and his son Assaf Ramon who died six years later when his F-16 fighter jet crashed in a training accident.Timna Airport, Israel deot. Transport, retrieved 28/04/2012 =Planning and construction= The South District Planning and Construction Committee gave its approval for the project in 2003, and advanced planning was approved by the Israeli government in July 2010. Construction was authorized on July 24, 2011, before advanced planning had been completed. The project will cost ‚Ç™1.95 billion and will be funded partly by real estate revenue from selling the Eilat Airport's land. The planning budget, approved on May 6, 2010, is ‚Ç™56 million. There was a plan to make the airport a build-operate-transfer (BOT) project, but the Israel Airports Authority (IAA) objected, and the government authorized it to plan and oversee the project. Despite this, it is estimated that if the IAA takes on the funding completely on its own, it will go bankrupt and default on its debts. Danya Cebus will build the passenger terminal. The terminal is set to feature a duty-free shop, a feature which was not present in Eilat Airport. Mer Group will provide command and control for the airport, including CCTV and perimeter protection. In May 2013, the cornerstone was laid in a ceremony attended by government officials and members of the Ramon family. Construction began two weeks later. The first test flight and landing in the airport took place on September 5, 2017. In January 2019, Jordan objected to Israel's opening of the airport, arguing that operation of the airport threatens the kingdom's airspace. Facilities The airport is located north of Eilat. Aside from Highway 90, it may also someday be reachable from the center of the country and Eilat via a proposed high-speed rail line and a light rail line that will connect it to the city. A bus terminal and a park and ride facility was built next to the airport at a cost ‚Ç™400 million. The bus terminal will replace the Eilat Central Bus Station. When the airport opened in 2019, the new bus station was not completed, and shuttle services are available for passengers to connect from the airport to the city of Eilat.How to get from Ramon Airport to Eilat, How to get from Ramon Airport to Eilat, retrieved 14/08/2016 All in all, the airport will be able to handle 2 million passengers a year. The airport features a runway and has eight remote-parking stands for large aircraft and nine for turboprop airplanes. The land area of the airport covers , and the main terminal building is . It has the world's tallest anti- missile fence tall and long.

The mission of the Church is for the sole purpose of planting churches both in Sri Lanka and abroad. History Living Christ Church started as a prayer group of like minded Christians in 1992. They organized themselves as a youth prayer group to pray for the evangelism and church planting initiatives in the war-torn north and east. It was a great need at that time, because of the evangelists and church workers were reluctant to go to northern part of Sri Lanka. Each week they prayed earnestly that God would send workers to minister in those difficult areas, never knowing, that God's intention was to send few of them for such task.History of Living Christ Church: 20th Anniversary Journal, 1 In 1993, two of the group members went to Mannar Island for an evangelism trip. The following day, LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam) bombed the ferry-port and they were trapped for nearly two months without any communication with Colombo. At that difficult moment, they prayed and decided to share the gospel with people around the Island. The two member evangelistic group managed to plant two viable church plants and establish two preaching points in the Island. After their arrival, they shared their experiences, God's provision and enablement. Positive experience and God's guidance led them to start another new work in Northeast. In the latter part of 1993, few of the team went to Vavuniya to pioneer new evangelistic work. They were successful to start a church plant, now a full-fledged Church named Jesus Saves Church in Vauniya. In 1994, group change their name to \\"Lanka Evangelical Society\\" and start to plant churches and train leaders to undertake those churches. Further, the society determined that the congregations have the discretion to remain in voluntary fellowship with the society or to become autonomous and independent. Due to new security regulations implemented in 1998, it was difficult to continue work in Vavuniya and the Evangelists decided to return to Colombo. Somewhere in the same year, the first church plant, Jesus Saves Church determined to detach from the society and to affiliate with a foreign church entity for much need financial support. From 1998 onwards Lanka Evangelical Society started work in the western and central part of Sri Lanka and successful in planting two churches in Kirulapone and Wattala. In 2005, Lanka Evangelical Society established the ecclesiastical body named \\"Living Christ Church\\" vested under Non-Episcopalian Churches Ordinance,http://www.commonlii.org/lk/legis/consol_act/nc431289.pdf to provide a working fellowship for all associated churches of the Society. In 2005, Lanka Evangelical Society transferred its vested-rights to the General Synod of the Living Christ Church. Ecclesiastical Polity The governing polity has risen out of practical necessities and not from any existing ecclesiastical model. The nature of the church is Presbyterian in its governance, emphasizing the plurality of leadershiphttps://bible.org/article/who-should-run-church-case-plurality- elders and freedom of conscience.http://www.reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/index.html?body=/documents/wcf_with_proofs/ch_XX.html Primarily the constitution and cannons of the church has articulated to incorporate different parishes into one church. The parishes are represented by ruling and teaching elders and the business of the whole church is deliberated at the annual assembly named for that purpose as General Synod. This is the ultimate authority for the church. The synod meets annually on the first Monday of December. In between two Synods, Executive committee acts as the representative authority of the Synod and accountable of all its actions to the successive Synod.see, Constitution and Cannons of Living Christ Church, Sri Lanka See also * Christianity in Sri Lanka * Religion in Sri Lanka * Roman Catholicism in Sri Lanka References  External links  * Living Christ Church Category:Evangelicalism in Sri Lanka ","title":"Living Christ Church"},{"id":"35408495","text":"Elena Dementieva was the defending champion, but didn't participate in this competition.

Notable Judgements =Freedom of Speech= Nariman and Jasti Chelameswar formed the two judge bench of the Supreme Court of India which struck down a controversial law which gave Indian police the power to arrest anyone accused of posting emails or other electronic messages which \\"causes annoyance or inconvenience\\". The judges held Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, which made such offenses punishable up to three years imprisonment, to be unconstitutional. The judgement was authored by Nariman. According to Nariman and Chelameswar, several terms in the law they were striking down were \\"open-ended, undefined and vague\\" which made them nebulous in nature. According to the judges: \\"What may be offensive to one may not be offensive to another. What may cause annoyance or inconvenience to one may not cause annoyance or inconvenience to another.\\" In their judgement the judges clarified that a distinction needs to be made between discussion, advocacy, and incitement. Any discussion, or advocacy of even an unpopular cause cannot be restricted, and it is only when such discussion or advocacy reaches the level of incitement whereby it causes public disorder or affects the security of the state can it be curbed. The judgement has been welcomed for defending the Indian Constitution's ideals of tolerance and the Constitutional provisions of free speech. It has been pointed out that the controversial law struck down by Nariman and Chelameswar had gained notoriety after many people in India started getting arrested for seemingly innocuous reasons on the ground that they had violated the now scrapped law. =Triple Talaq= In a landmark judgement, a five-judge Bench struck down instantaneous triple talaq by 3‚Äì2 majority and termed it void, illegal and unconstitutional. While Justice Kurian Joseph, Justice Rohinton Fali Nariman and Justice Uday Umesh Lalit struck down the practice; Chief Justice JS Khehar and Justice Abdul Nazeer asked Parliament to make a law in this regard.http://www.india.com/news/india/triple-talaq-verdict-not-unanimous- says-aimim-mp-asaduddin-owaisi-2419584/ Justice Rohinton Fali Nariman judgement was against the practice of Triple Talaq where he stated \\"Triple Talaq is a disapproved form of divorce.

Chandrachud, delivered a dissent in Kantaru Rajeevaru v. Indian Young Lawyers Association. He held that the decision of five judges in the Sabarimala case which held that women of the ages of ten and fifty shall not be denied entry to the Sabarimala temple is not a fit case for the exercise of review jurisdiction as the judgment does not suffer from an error apparent on the face of record. The dissent observed that the executive is under a constitutional obligation to implement the decisions of the Supreme Court even if they were not parties before them. Justice Nariman observed: > Bona fide criticism of a judgment, albeit of the highest court of the land, > is certainly permissible, but thwarting, or encouraging persons to thwart, > the directions or orders of the highest court cannot be countenanced in our > Constitutional scheme of things.

Flower Fairy would usually be seen selling CDs during Dub FX's performances or on stage alongside Stanford when they perform several tracks together. She is also featured singing on tracks from Everythinks A Ripple, \\"Wandering Love\\", \\"Flow\\", and \\"Time Will Tell\\". Two songs from Everythinks A Ripple, \\"Flow\\", and \\"Wandering Love\\", feature a street saxophonist named Mr. Woodnote, who also uses similar looping techniques as Dub FX, using a saxophone. After his first summer traveling through Europe in 2006, he came home to Melbourne where he shared a flat with Melbourne-based producer Sirius. Stanford showed Sirius this new style from the UK called dubstep. and by 2010 together they released the album titled Dub FX and Sirius ‚Äì A Crossworlds. Dub FX does not beatbox on this album. Dub FX is also part of the dubstep act Kila Mega Giga Tera, the other half being Glade Kettle (Distro)(aka Sirius).

Dub FX is also the main founder of the label Convoyunltd, which could be described as a co-op label for Dub FX's own work and that of other artists. To date, artists that have released albums on Convoyunltd are: Flower Fairy, Sirius, Mr. Woodnote, and Dub FX, with additional featured artists on separate songs of each album. Every album released through Convoyunltd has been produced by Dub FX with the exception of Dub FX & Sirius's release, A Crossworlds, a collaboration album released in 2010 which revealed a much darker and instrumental sound. Dub FX's lyrics address both general world events and contemporary angst, while suggesting individual-based revolution through self-determination and engagement. He also addresses issues of social importance, the most notable example being the song Society's Gates, loosely based on the life of the philosopher Socrates. Equipment Dub FX started off with a Boss GT-6 multi- effects pedal which he then traded up for the GT-8, and now uses a Boss GT-10B bass guitar effects pedal for nearly all the effects used over his voice. He also used an Akai Head Rush pedal for a loop station originally, but has since also upgraded this to a Boss RC-50 Loop station and then the Boss RC-505 Loop station respectively. Note that he also uses an SYB-5 Bass synth to add an extra depth to the bass line. On stage he uses a DR-880 Rhythm Machine for some songs. In the past he has toyed with other equipment like the Boss A/B foot switch (an add-on for the RC-50) as well as a green slicer pedal, as seen in his Ghent performance.

It had a limited theatrical release in 2010, and a DVD release in 2011. The film stars Rhiannon Leigh Wryn, Bart Johnson, Billy Unger, and Bob Gibson, and a larger-than-life animatronic puppet of the \\"Monster Mutt\\".  Plot  The family dog, Max, is kidnapped by Sirus Caldwell (Zack Ward) to be used as a product test subject. Max escapes but the new super energy drink he had been testing turns him into Monster Mutt (Bob Gibson). The Taylor family children, Ashley (Rhiannon Leigh Wryn) and Zach (Billy Unger) join up with the scientist responsible for his transformation, Dr. Victor Lloyd (Brian Stepanek), to find a cure and return Max to normal.  Cast  * Rhiannon Leigh Wryn as Ashley Taylor * Bart Johnson as Jeff Taylor * Billy Unger as Zack Taylor * Bob Gibson as Monster Mutt * Zack Ward as Sirus Caldwell * Brian Stepanek as Dr. Victor Lloyd * Mindy Sterling as Helen * Juliet Landau as Natalya * Alastair Mackenzie as Monty * John Kassir as Pet Shop Pete * Kim Fields as Valerie Williams * China Anderson as Nicole Williams * Jacqueline Pinol as Tawni Martinez * Destin Bigsby as Charlie  Production  Filmed entirely within the Santa Clarita Valley, director Todd Tucker and producer Harvey Lowry created the film as their first feature film together. Known primarily for their makeup and special effects work in Hollywood, the two decided to use their skills for film production of Monster Mutt. Tucker was inspired to write the film's story by having watched Steven Spielberg‚Äôs Gremlins and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial when he was younger. The two men kept the budget purposely low, in hopes of maximizing profit. Designed and built by academy award-winning Drac Studios, the character of Monster Mutt is a larger-than-life animatronic puppet requiring five people to control its movements.  Soundtrack  Scott A. Johnson of Dread Central wrote that the film soundtrack, as composed and conducted by Chris Walden, was performed by West Australian Philharmonic Orchestra, and \\"contains everything one would expect from a movie aimed at kids around ten years old.\\" Johnson stated that the soundtrack's failure was \\"in its lack of through-line and 'signature' sound'\\", but that the tracks did what they were supposed to do, in that it \\"takes the film, amplifies its emotions, and does so in a way that is kid-friendly.\\" Soundtrack Geek wrote that the soundtrack of the Monster Mutt film was released to show Walden's skill as a composer. They wrote that as the trailer \\"looks horrifying from an adult perspective, but more fun for the kids\\", the film is one that an adult might not otherwise see \\"unless you have children between the age of 5 and 10\\". In their review of the soundtrack, they wrote of the composer, \\"Emmy Award winner Chris Walden has been stuck in TV movie land since the early nighties, but now he has a chance to shine in a proper movie.\\" Tracksounds wrote that the soundtrack for Monster Mutt \\"captures all the different genres in a kid flick ‚Äì and them some\\", and that it was \\"an unexpected pleasure to listen to\\". They also wrote that this is \\"another instance of wishing we could see what the composer can do with a bigger budget or bigger screen\\". Sci-fi- online wrote that \\"Chris Walden's score for Monster Mutt is about a million times better than the low budget movie ... that it accompanies\\", and it is otherwise \\"a great score which is unfortunately not helped by being associated with a mediocre kids film\\". The soundtrack contains: # Main Title (02:40) # Looking for Max (01:03) # School Is Out (01:31) # Max's Transformation (02:19) # Dad Brought Pizza (01:59) # Noise from the Backyard (03:04) # Ashley and Dad (01:28) # Surprise Visit in the Lab (02:18) # The Boy with Ice Cream (01:55) # Max in the Night (01:27) # Anybody Out There (01:27) # The Vacuum Cleaner (01:14) # Water (02:40) # The Garage Door (02:06) # Broom Fight (01:24) # Max at the Vet (02:53) # Max Breaks Out (02:18) # Max Is Hungry (03:02) # Break in at the Vet (03:13) # Fire Rescue (04:56) # Lab Fight (05:27) # Monster Puppy (03:30) # Looking for Max (Reprise) (01:03)  Release  A trailer of the film was screened on January 10, 2010 at the Santa Clarita Valley Film Festival, immediately preceding the festival's award ceremonies, and was released theatrically in July 2010 with showings at locations such as the Laemmle's Sunset 5 theater in Los Angeles. The film was released on DVD on January 4, 2011.  Reception  Scott Foy of Dread Central wrote that there is a need for family-friendly horror for kids and \\"that's where movies like Monster Mutt come in\\", despite the movie not actually containing any horror elements and being a lighthearted size-change comedy. Covering Media called the film \\"Beethoven meets Honey, I Blew Up the Kid\\", while also referring to the film as a \\"heartwarming comedy/adventure for the whole family\\". Krinein wrote that the film seemed designed for television and aimed at entertaining children on a Sunday afternoon, offering that this \\"unpretentious film manages to keep the attention of those willing to grant it.\\" They also offered that considering its budget, and in making comparisons to Howard the Duck and Harry and the Hendersons, the film is quite funny. The Dove Foundation praised the film, offering that actor Brian Stepanek did \\"a wonderful job as the bumbling doctor, who tries to make up for his mistake\\", and that with its \\"slapstick comedy, this film may be a family favorite. It is a movie that is wholesome and enjoyable for the entire family.\\" The Oklahoman, in calling the film \\"the oddest DVD to appear on release lists\\", noted that the cast \\"features a well- scrubbed cast of actors from TV shows and films that younger viewers will know well.\\" References External links Category:American science fiction comedy films Category:2010 films Category:American films Category:English- language films Category:Films about dogs Category:Films featuring puppetry Category:American independent films Category:Fiction about size change Category:2010s science fiction comedy films Category:2010 comedy films ","title":"Monster Mutt (film)"},{"id":"35408680","title":"Mark Carleton-Smith"},{"id":"35408702","text":"India‚ÄìPhilippines relations refers to the foreign relations between the Republic of India and the Republic of the Philippines. Diplomatic relations between India and the Philippines was established in 1949. India maintains an embassy in Manila, whilst the Philippines maintains one in New Delhi. A Treaty of Friendship was signed between the Philippines and India on 11 July 1952. History =Early history= Indian elements in Philippine culture point to early relations between the two societies. However, some works posit that the influx of Indian cultural elements into the Philippines is understood only in terms of the developments in the intervening regions between these two areas, the Malay Peninsula and the Indonesian Archipelago, where there was an intensified process of Indian influences from the 2nd through the late 14th centuries CE. Through the Srivijaya and Majapahit empires, Indian influences would have reached the Philippines from the 10th through the early 14th centuries, based on the events in these two regions, and through direct migration from the Indian subcontinent to the Philippines. Artifacts of Indian orientation have been found in a lot of islands in the Philippines. The golden image of the female Bodhisattva which was found in Agusan, was related to the development of Buddhism in Southeast Asia dating back to the late 13th and 14th centuries. The introduction of Sanskrit words and literature may be dated to the 10th and 12th centuries. Until now, Sanskrit words are still found in abundance in various Philippine languages. Then there is the folk narrative among the Maranao, known as Maharadia Lawana which shows an Indian character and whose story is very similar to the Indian epic Ramayana. The existence of rajahnates in Philippine classic history, especially in Cebu and Butuan, also points to heavy influences from Indian cultures. Hinduism was also prevalent in various societies in the Philippines, notably in central and southern islands, along with the banks of Manila Bay and Laguna de Bay. =Colonial era= During the period 1762-1764, during the various Anglo-Spanish wars, 600 Sepoy (or native Indian) troops arrived in the Philippines as part of the military expedition of the East India Company. When the British troops withdrew, many of the Sepoys mutinied and refused to leave. They settled in what is now Cainta, Rizal. The region in and around Cainta still has many Sepoy descendants. During the 18th century, there was robust trade between Manila and the Coromandel Coast of Bengal, involving Philippine exports of tobacco, silk, cotton, indigo, sugar cane and coffee. =Post World War II era= The Philippines established diplomatic relations with India on 26 November 1949. The first Philippine envoy to India was the late Foreign Secretary Narciso Ramos. Five years after India‚Äôs independence in 1947, the Philippines and India signed a Treaty of Friendship on 11 July 1952 in ManilaTreaty of Friendship between the Republic of the Philippines and the Republic of India Dept. of Foreign Affairs, Philippines to strengthen the friendly relations existing between the two countries. Soon after, the Philippine Legation in New Delhi was established and then elevated to an embassy.Embassy of the Philippines, New Delhi, India . Newdelhipe.com. Retrieved 2011-11-12. However, due to foreign policy differences as a result of the bipolar alliance structure of the Cold War, the development of bilateral relations was stunted. It was only in 1976 that relations started to normalize when Aditya Vikram Birla, one of India‚Äôs successful industrialists, met with then President Ferdinand E. Marcos to explore possibilities of setting up joint ventures in the Philippines. This resulted in the establishment of Indo-Philippine Textile Mills, Inc. (Indo-Phil), then the largest Indian investment in the country. Indo-Phil currently employs 2,000 Filipino workers and supplies 40% of Philippine domestic demand for yarn. The Trade Agreement between the Philippines and India was signed on 29 May 1979. In 1995, following the first Philippine Trade Mission to India, a Joint Working Group and a Joint Business Council were set up to assess and identify potentials for trade as well as identify new areas for collaboration. Since then, bilateral meetings have been held regularly. = 21st Century relations = Policy Consultation Talks between the two countries were established in 2000. The talks, which are held annually and conducted by senior officials of the foreign ministries of the two countries, aimed at discussing bilateral issues and regional and international issues of common concern. Both countries signed a Joint Declaration for Co-operation to Combat International Terrorism to complement the ASEAN-India Joint Declaration to Combat International Terrorism which was adopted by the Heads of Government and States of ASEAN and India on 8 October 2003 in Bali, Indonesia. The declaration seeks to enhance intelligence and information sharing on counter-terrorism measures, strengthen capacity-building efforts through training and education, capability and readiness, including training and technical assistance; and to continue working together in the fight against the cyber crime and terrorist misuse of cyber space. The first RP‚ÄìIndia Security Dialogue was held in Manila on 12 March 2004. The Philippines and India agreed to establish a security dialogue that would serve as a policy forum for sharing security assessments and for reviewing and giving direction to co-operation in bilateral/regional security and defence matters. In commemoration of the 60th anniversary of Philippines‚ÄìIndia diplomatic relations, and pursuant to Presidential Proclamation 1924, the month of November 2009 was proclaimed as Philippines‚ÄìIndia Friendship Month by then President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. The ASEAN‚ÄìIndia Free Trade Area agreement signed by India in 2009 also includes the Philippines as signatory. =Joint Commission on Bilateral Co- operation= The agreement to establish a Joint Commission on Bilateral Co- operation was signed during the State Visit to India of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo on 5 October 2007. The establishment of the Joint Commission on Bilateral Co-operation aims to further strengthen and develop the co- operation in the field of trade, economic, scientific, technological and other fields of co-operation. The meeting of the Joint Commission will be co-chaired by the two countries‚Äô Ministers for Foreign Affairs who will meet once every two years. The inaugural session of the Joint Commission was held on 15 March 2011, co-chaired by Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert F. Del Rosario, and was held in New Delhi. During the meeting both sides agreed to move forward on co- operative initiatives in various fronts (trade, agriculture, defence). During the 2018 ASEAN‚ÄìIndia Commemorative Summit in New Delhi, where the Delhi Declaration was signed, Philippines-India relations was one of the two most focal bilateral discussions made. India is targeting billions of investments in Philippine markets, notably in the pharmaceutical, information technology, energy, and transportation which would lead to the creation of 10,000 jobs.http://www.atimes.com/article/india-takes-fight-china-via-seasia/# Cultural relations Filipino culture had Indian influences. About 30 percent of the Tagalog language were loanwords from Sanskrit. The use of brass, bronze, copper and tin in Philippine decorative arts and metal works also had Indian origin. Early Filipino literature and folklore also had Indian influences such as the Maranao epic of Darangan and the Ifugao tale of Balituk. The Philippine folk belief regarding eclipses, where some narrates that the dragon called laho bites the moon or sun to cause the phenomenon is related to the Indian belief regarding the being Rahu from Hindu tradition. Military relations The Philippines supported India‚Äôs candidature for the non-permanent membership of the UN Security Council for the term 2011-12 and there is regular consultation between delegations of both countries in the UN and other multilateral fora. Several Foreign Service officers from the Philippines have attended the ASEAN diplomats‚Äô course that is held at the Foreign Service Institute in India. Indian navy and coast guard ships regularly visit the Philippines and hold consultations with their counterparts.INS Satpura and INS Kadmatt visited Manila from 3-6 October 2017, Indian Coast guard Ship ICGS Samarth visited Manila from 7-10 January 2017, INS Sahyadri and INS Sakthi visited Manila on a goodwill visit to Subic Bay from 30 May -2 June 2016; INS Sahyadri visited Manila from 1‚Äì4 November 2015; and from 20‚Äì23 August 2014; ICGS Samudra Paheredar visited Manila from 19-22 September 2014; a flotilla of four Indian ships from the Eastern Fleet, namely INS Shakti, INS Satpura, INS Ranjit and INS Kirch visited Manila on a goodwill visit from 12-16 June 2013. The participation of officers of the armed forces of both countries in various specialized training courses in each other‚Äôs countries has intensified, as have visits by National Defence College (NDC) delegations, including the first-ever NDC visit from the Philippines to India. A delegation from the College of Defence Management of India visited the Philippines from 23‚Äì31 October 2015; a delegation from Army High Command Course of India visited the Philippines from 10‚Äì14 November 2014. Government of India sent an Indian Air Force flight with relief material for the victims of super typhoon ‚ÄòHaiyan, which struck the Philippines on 7‚Äì8 November 2013. Following the tragic loss of life, livelihood and property as a result of the typhoon Pablo/Bopha, which struck the southern Philippines in December 2012, the Government of India provided disaster relief assistance of $200,000 to the Philippines Government and $100,000 as disaster relief assistance following the October 2013 earthquake in Bohol. India announced an immediate relief assistance of $500,000(equivalent to 25 million pesos) on 11 July 2017 for the relief and rehabilitation efforts underway in the city of Marawi which had come under siege on May 23, 2017, after armed terrorists belonging to the Maute group, owing allegiance to ISIS took over the city. Ships from the Indian Navy and Coast Guard regularly visits the Philippines. Trade Relations According to India's Ministry of External Affairs, India- Philippines trade is at around $1.6 billion.Philippines in dialogue with India on rubber Economic relations have grown gradually over the years. Despite the impact of the India-ASEAN FTA in Goods, the India-Philippines trade has, so far, been at around $1.981 billion in 2016-17. In the year 2016-17, India‚Äôs exports amounted to worth USD 1487 million and imports worth USD 494 million. However, a number of growth drivers suggest a major and sustained growth in two-way trade and investment, helped by the conclusion of the India-ASEAN Trade in Services and Investment Agreements. Indian investment in the Philippines is mainly in the areas of textiles, garments, IT&ITes;, steel, Airports, chemicals, Automobiles and pharmaceuticals. Indian Community in the Philippines The Indian community in the Philippines, according to the Bureau of Immigration, is estimated to be about 1, 20,000. Around 5,000 persons of Indian origin have acquired Filipino citizenship. Punjabis and Sindhis, constitute the bulk of the community. Since the last ten years, there are a growing number of professionals, estimated in the range of about 1500 persons, who are working in the Philippines, in organizations such as the Asian Development Bank, International Rice Research Institute, UN agencies, as also in multinational corporations, BPOs and with Indian joint ventures in the country. The Philippines is also beginning to emerge as a destination for Indian students. There are more than 10,000 Indian students pursuing medical courses in various universities in the Philippines. Currently nearly, 50 per cent of the students at the prestigious Asian Institute of Management in Manila are from India. The flying schools are also attractive as instructions are in English and students do not have to learn the local language. Several universities in the Philippines, such as the University of Santo Tomas, the University of the Philippines, THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTHERN PHILIPPINES, the University of the Visayas, Adamson University, the University of Mindanao and others have opened special ‚ÄòIndia chapters‚Äô in their prestigious libraries, which houses the collection of books on India [gifted through the Public Diplomacy division of the Ministry of External Affairs].

Although this information was on file with the government and thus available for public perusal, Sagayam said, he felt that it should be made more visible to the public. In an interview with the Deccan Herald, he stated that the district collector should set an example of honesty for his subordinates, and that actions like his might tend to rehabilitate the tarnished image of civil servants. Sagayam was the first IAS officer in Tamil Nadu to publicize his financial information thus.Venkatesh, M. R. \\"IAS officer makes assets public\\". Deccan Herald. 2009-11-11. Retrieved 2014-12-16. Archived 2014-12-14 at Wayback Machine. In Namakkal, Sagayam attempted to reform the village administrative officer (VAO) system. He pursued VAOs who lived in cities, far away from the villages that they were charged with overseeing. When VAOs and local politicians attempted to have Sagayam transferred, over 5000 villagers protested the transfer attempt, forcing its withdrawal. Madurai In March 2011, at the behest of the Election Commission of India, Sagayam was posted as the District Collector of Madurai, and as the ex-officio District Election Officer, he charged with the task of ensuring that the 2011 Legislative Assembly elections were conducted fairly. Up to that time, Madurai elections had been controlled by M. K. Alagiri, son of DMK party leader M. Karunanidhi. DMK victories had been assured by the purchase of votes with money and gifts. Sagayam arrived in the state 20 days before voting commenced. He staged a campaign to educate voters about the law, and to urge them to reject proffered bribes; he also stepped up efforts to detect vote-buying, and confiscated Rs20lakh (Rs 2,000,000) intended for distribution to voters. Sagayam was twice burned in effigy by DMK loyalists; and two cases were filed against him accusing him of favouring rival party AIADMK, both of which were dismissed. AIADMK won the election, and Sagayam was commended by India's Chief Election Commissioner for his work on the election.\\"How collector David made Goliath MK Alagiri run for shelter\\".

In September 2011, Sagayam again found himself opposed to Alagiri. In constructing a family-owned engineering college near Madurai, Alagiri and family members had purportedly destroyed irrigation canals used by hundreds of impecunious farmers. Sagayam issued a \\"strongly worded summons\\" to Alagari and his wife and son, forcing him to come before a court and explain why action should not be taken against them. =Granite quarrying= In May 2012, Sagayam investigated reports of illegal granite quarrying in the vicinity of Madurai. These activities had been noted in 2008 by a Right to Information (RTI) activist. Pursuant to his complaint, the Madras High Court had ordered an inquiry in 2009, but nothing came of it until 2010, when Tamil-language daily newspaper Dina Bhoomi ran a series of articles, implicating among others Durai Dayanidhi, Alagiri's eldest son. This led to the arrest on specious charges of the RTI activist and the Dina Bhoomi editor. The issue was brought up in the 2011 elections, and pursued after the AIADMK government was formed. Sagayam's May 2012 report accused several senior officials of collusion with illegal granite miners, and suggested that losses to the state from illegal mining amounted to at least Rs 16,000 crore (Rs 160 billion), and possibly twice that. Four days later, he was transferred from his position as district collector to a post as managing director of Co-optex, a handloom weavers' cooperative in Chennai. Sagayam came into conflict with a superior at Co-optex as well. When a manager at the cooperative was assaulted by members of AIADMK, Sagayam filed a complaint against the assailants, contrary to the wishes of state textiles minister S. Gokula Indira. He also refused to provide permanent office space in the cooperative's building to Indira, maintaining that this would interfere with the cooperative's functioning. As a result of this, Sagayam was transferred twice in September 2014: first to the position of Indian Medicine and Homeopathy commissioner; then, two days later, to the vice-chairmanship of Science City in Chennai.\\"Meet Tamil Nadu‚Äôs own Khemka\\". Hindustan Times. 2014-09-09. Retrieved 2014-12-14. Archived 2014-09-15 at Wayback Machine. Although the granite-quarrying investigation had languished after Sagayam's transfer, the issue did not die. Sagayam's report was leaked to the press in August 2012, prompting a public outcry that compelled the government to pursue the matter. Under Anshul Mishra, Sagayam's successor as district collector, a number of arrests were made in January 2013; Durai Dayanidhi went into hiding. Several officials, including two former Madurai district collectors, were investigated for alleged collusion with illegal granite operations. However, in June 2013, Mishra was transferred, and the investigation again lost all momentum.\\"Madurai will miss Mishra\\". The Hindu. 2013-06-29. Retrieved 2014-12-17. Archived 2013-12-13 at Wayback Machine. In July 2014, as a citizen activist filed a petition with the Madras High Court, seeking to rekindle the inquiry. In response, the court appointed Sagayam to the post of Special Officer-cum-Legal Commissioner, charged with the task of investigating all mining operations in Tamil Nadu, and ordered the state government to relieve him of the Science City post. The government attempted to contest the order, maintaining that the investigation was concluded; the court rejected their arguments and, in November 2014, Sagayam was duly appointed. It was suggested, however, that the state government might attempt to limit his investigation to granite operations in the Madurai area, keeping him from looking into sand mining on the beaches and along the rivers of the state. Sagayam's investigation was allegedly obstructed from several quarters. District officials purportedly gave him little cooperation; his room was allegedly wiretapped; and he and his team were purportedly attacked by goons acting on behalf of granite-mining interests. On one occasion, when the police were slow to exhume bodies of alleged victims of human sacrifice carried out by quarry operators, Sagayam spent the night in the graveyard to ensure that no one tampered with the evidence. The investigation discovered evidence of extensive illegal granite-mining from public and private land, and diversion or destruction of rivers and water bodies. Raids on the houses of two former Madurai collectors suggested complicity by government officials.Sundar, S. \\"Sagayam spends the night at graveyard\\". The Hindu. 2015-09-14. Retrieved 2017-08-13.

She lives in New Mexico. She is a recipient of the RITA Award. Charley Davidson novels Darynda Jones‚Äô protagonist Charley Davidson is a private investigator living in Albuquerque, New Mexico but that isn't all Charley does for a living. Charley is a portal to heaven and was born onto Earth as a Grim Reaper. Not only can she see the dead but she can touch them. The dead who have lingered around after passing, due to numerous reasons, can see her 'light' from anywhere on Earth. When they pass through her, Charley gets a glimpse of their life, scents, feelings, memories and such. The first person to pass through Charley was her mother who died giving birth to Charley. Her mother told her she loved her and then passed through Charley. Charley remembers this because her memory extends from the day she was born. One of the first things she can recall is the Big Bad, a being shrouded in darkness who always seemed to be saving her. The books balance humor, romance and suspense. =Characters= Charlotte/Charley Davidson: The main character who tries to balance life as a private investigator and grim reaper. She lives in a building across from her office, which is above her fathers' bar. From as early as the age of five, Charley has been helping her father, a former policeman, and her uncle Bob, also a cop, solve cases using her reaper abilities. She is sarcastic and has quick wit. She is a portal to heaven for the souls of the departed to cross through. She is able to heal faster than any other human and, when forced, she can move at an inhuman speed. She has the cunning ability to almost get killed in the most unlikely places. Reyes Farrow: A boy who Charley met when she was younger and tried to save after witnessing him being beaten by his father. At that time, he called her 'Dutch'. Later, she comes across him in prison. He was charged with the murder of his abusive father. Reyes has a large fan base of women who scour prison photos for good looking men. He often visits Charley in her dreams while she was unaware it was him. He is the son of Satan. He was sent to look for a portal to heaven, but once he saw her he wanted to be with her and thus got himself born onto Earth. Just as Charley is a portal to heaven, Reyes, is a portal to hell. Leland Davidson: Charley and Gemma's father was once a cop. He would get help solving cases with Charley's ability to speak to the dead. Now he owns a bar and allows his daughter to use the second floor as an office for her clients. It took three days for Leland to see Charley after his wife's death but he loves his daughter very much. By the end of the second book, and for most of the third book, Leland's relationship with Charley is strained after he sends a killer after her. Leland knew that Charley would be all right due to some strange events that occurred when Charley was younger. However, he did not warn her and she ended up facing the murderer after being caught off guard. Cookie: Cookie and her daughter, Amber, live across the hall from Charley. Cookie is her best friend and they work together. Charley does field work while Cookie does the research. They bonded over their love of coffee. Cookie worries about Charley after she stops sleeping, due to Reyes invading her dreams. She does her best to help her in any way. She knows all about Charley's abilities and about Reyes. Gemma: Gemma is Charley's older sister. The two of them were in competition when they were at university. They are almost estranged and rarely speak. Gemma knows that Charley can see and speak to the dead and is aware of the fact she is the Grim Reaper but hides it. Gemma gets along with her stepmother while Charley doesn't. Denise: Denise is Charley's stepmother and finds Charley to be an embarrassment. She has never accepted Charley's abilities and hates to be around her. Uncle Bob: Charley is close to her Uncle who she regularly helps on cases as long as he returns the favour. He has access to things that one would need a police clearance to get. He loves her, stands by her, fears for her, and supports her whenever she needs it. When her father tells her to quit her job, her Uncle Bob stands by her side and promises to talk to him. Garret Swopes: Garret was told of Charley's abilities by Uncle Bob one night when he was drunk. Garret had a hard time coming to terms with the idea. He dislikes Reyes and his involvement with Charley, just as Reyes hates Garret's involvement. He becomes a close friend to Charley and often helps her when she needs it, and even when she doesn't want it. Angel: Angel is a 13yr old ghost Charley met on the same night as Reyes. Angel was killed trying to stop a drive by shooting and works for Charley by tailing the suspects. In return, Charley sends the money he would have earned to his mother. He keeps trying to see Charley naked. Rocket: A ghost who has the uncanny ability to know the names of every person who has died. He lives in an asylum and even though he's old his personality is that of a big kid. He enjoys pretending to scare Charley and gets excited whenever she mentions names. He has a younger sister named Blue, who died when she was little.

The uterine fibroids tend to occur at younger age and larger and more numerous than in general population. They may be distinguishable from sporadic fibroids by special histological features such as prominent nucleoli with perinucleolar halos. The skin presentation is of asymmetrical, reddish- brown nodules or papules with a firm consistency, predominantly located on the limbs (multiple cutaneous leiomyoma), although they may occur anywhere, including the face. The lesions, which are typically painful and most often present during the third decade of life, are piloleiomyomata‚Äîa benign smooth muscle tumour arising from the arrectores pilorum muscles of the skin. These tumours may also arise in the tunica dartos of the scrotum and the mammillary muscle of the nipple (genital leiomyoma), the smooth muscle of blood vessels (angioleiomyoma) and the lung (pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis). A pseudo- Darier sign may be present. The renal cell carcinoma tends to be of the papillary (type 2) form and tends to occur more commonly in women than men with this syndrome. These cancers present earlier than is usual for renal cell carcinomas (typically in the twenties and thirties) and to be at relatively advanced stages at presentation. Tumours have rarely been reported in children. These tumours occur in ~20% of those with this mutation suggesting that other factors are involved in the pathogenesis. =Associated conditions= Other relatively rare conditions have been reported in association with this disease. It is not yet known if these associations are fortuitous or manifestations of the condition itself. Cerebral cavernomas and massive, macronodular adrenocortical disease have also been reported in association with this syndrome. A case of cutis verticis gyrata, disseminated collagenoma and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease in association with a mutation in the fumarate hydratase gene has also been reported. Two cases of ovarian mucinous cystadenoma have also been reported with this mutation. Cause The fumarate hydratase gene, located on the long arm of chromosome 1 (1q42.3-43), spans 22 kilobases and has 10 exons. The first exon codes for a signal peptide. Pathogenesis While the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the lesions remain unclear, it has been suggested that the accumulation of fumarate may lead to overexpression of the aldo-keto reductase enzyme, AKR1B10. It has also been found that fumerate is present in the mitochondria and in the cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic form appears to have a role in the protection of DNA from molecular injury. Fumarate has been shown to be a competitive inhibitor of prolyl hydroxylase. This inhibition leads to the stabilisation of a number of hypoxia-inducible factors which are thought to predispose to tumorigensis. An alternative pathway for the metabolism of fumarate in the presence of these mutations has been described. Other genes involved affected by this mutation are Keap1, Nrf2 and HMOX1. Diagnosis The diagnosis is made either by testing of the fumarate hydratase activity in cultured skin fibroblasts or lymphoblastoid cells and demonstrating reduced activity (‚â§60%) or by molecular genetic testing. Special histologic features of fibroids may allow an early diagnosis in absence of other symptoms. =Histology= The skin lesions may be difficult to diagnose clinically but a punch biopsy will usually reveal a Grenz zone separating the tumour from the overlying skin. Histological examination shows dense dermal nodules composed of elongated cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm arranged in fascicles (spindle cells). The nuclei are uniform, blunt-ended and cigar-shaped with only occasional mitoses. Special stains that may be of use in the diagnosis include Masson's trichrome, Van Gieson's stain and phosphotungstic acid‚Äìhaematoxylin. The renal cell carcinomas have prominent eosinophilic nucleoli surrounded by a clear halo. =Differential diagnosis= Differential diagnosis of this condition includes the Birt-Hogg-Dub√© syndrome and tuberous sclerosis. As the skin lesions are typically painful, it is also often necessary to exclude other painful tumors of the skin (including blue rubber bleb nevus, leiomyoma, eccrine spiradenoma, neuroma, dermatofibroma, angiolipoma, neurilemmoma, endometrioma, glomus tumor and granular cell tumor; the mnemonic \\"BLEND-AN-EGG\\" may be helpful). Other skin lesions that may need to be considered include cylindroma, lipoma, poroma and trichoepithelioma; these tend to be painless and have other useful distinguishing features. Treatment Uterine fibroids can be treated with the same methods like sporadic uterine fibroids including antihormonal treatment, surgery or embolisation. Substantially elevated risk of progression to or independent development of uterine leiomyosarcoma has been reported which may influence treatment methods. The predisposition to renal cell cancer calls for screening and, if necessary, urological management. The skin lesions may be difficult to treat as they tend to recur after excision or destructive treatment. Drugs which affect smooth muscle contraction, such as doxazosin, nitroglycerine, nifedipine and phenoxybenzamine, may provide pain relief. Topical lidocaine patches have been reported to decrease in severity and frequency of pain cutaneous leiomyomas.  Prognosis  A 2006 review stated that RS often leads renal cancer between ages 30-50. Renal cancer kills about 1 in 3 people, but 5-year survival rates improved between 1974-1976 and 1995-2000, from 52% to 64%. History The syndrome was first described by Reed et al in 1973. The link with the fumarate hydratase gene was uncovered in 2002. Notes A database of the mutations of the fumarate hydratase gene is available. Autosomal recessive mutations cause a serious neurological disease known as fumarase deficiency, which is associated with a variety of congenital lesions in the brain.

It was an operational airfield between 1944 and 1992, being used by both the Royal Air Force (when it was known as RAF Brawdy) and by Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm (RNAS Brawdy), before closing in 1992. The site was reactivated in 1995 by the British Army and became Cawdor Barracks, home to 14 Signal Regiment, the army's electronic warfare unit. History The Royal Air Force station at Brawdy officially opened on 2 February 1944 as a satellite station for the heavy bomber aircraft of nearby RAF St Davids. =Royal Naval Air Station Brawdy= Fairey Gannet AEW.3 of 849 Squadron based at RNAS Brawdy in 1970left On 1 January 1946 the station was handed over to the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Navy and became Royal Naval Air Station (RNAS Brawdy), initially used as a Relief Landing Ground for RNAS Dale located near Milford Haven. It was commissioned as HMS Goldcrest on 4 September 1952 and in March 1953 the first Hawker Sea Hawk entered service with 806 Naval Air Squadron. From 1963 till 1971 Brawdy was home to Fairey Gannets and Hawker Hunters in the Airborne Early Warning (AEW) and advanced flying training roles respectively. The Royal Navy left in 1971 and the base was allocated to the Department of the Environment. =RAF Brawdy= In February 1974 the Royal Air Force returned to Brawdy with 'D' Flight of No. 22 Squadron taking up residence with their Westland Whirlwind HAR.10 search and rescue helicopters. In September of the same year No. 229 Operational Conversion Unit, later the Tactical Weapons Unit (TWU), relocated with the Hawker Hunters after the closure of RAF Chivenor in Devon. By the late 1970s, the TWU operated British Aerospace Hawk T1A Squadron. = Transfer to the British Army = As part of the rationalisation of advanced and tactical weapons training, flying ceased at Brawdy on 31 August 1992. A small number of RAF personnel remained including No. 202 Squadron and their Westland Sea Kings, which eventually left in July 1994. Brawdy was transferred to the British Army in 1995 and became Cawdor Barracks, the army's main electronic warfare base. The name originated from the local Earls of Cawdor (who owned the Stackpole Estate).

He made notable contributions in electronic engineering and solid-state physics during the early days of transistor development at Bell Laboratories. In particular, he produced experimental evidence that holes could diffuse through bulk germanium, and not just along the surface as previously thought. This paved the way from Bardeen and Brattain's point-contact transistor to Shockley's more-robust junction transistor. Shive is best known for inventing the phototransistor in 1948 (a device that combines the sensitivity to light of a photodiode and the current gain of a transistor), and for the Shive wave machine in 1959 (an educational apparatus used to illustrate wave motion). Early life and education John N. Shive was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on February 22, 1913, and grew up in New Jersey. Shive graduated from Rutgers University with a BS in physics and chemistry in 1934. He also earned a PhD from Johns Hopkins University, submitting a dissertation Practice and theory of the modulation of Geiger counters in 1939. Shive became a fellow of the American Physical Society, a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa and Sigma Xi fraternities.Contributors to Proceedings of the I.R.E. 1952, Scientific career John N. Shive joined Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1939. Shive worked initially on physical research and device development, and later on education and training. After retirement from industry, he worked as an adjunct professor of physics at Georgian Court University.Special lecturer, physics, Georgian Court Coll. Lakewood, N.J.

Smithsonian Institution Research Information System. Retrieved September 13, 2019. =Transistor development= On January 30, 1948 Shive discovered that gold-plated tungsten point contacts on a p-type layer of germanium grown on an n-type substrate gave \\"a terrific triode effect\\". On February 13, he also discovered that a transistor consisting of bronze contacts on the surface of an n-type substrate without a p-layer gave \\"gains up to 40√ó in power!\\" He leveraged this discovery to build a point contact transistor with bronze contacts on the front and back of thin wedge of germanium, proving that holes could diffuse through bulk germanium and not just along the surface as previously thought. This confirmed William Shockley's idea that it should be possible to build a junction transistor, an idea that hitherto he had kept secret from the rest of the team. Shockley later admitted that the workings of the team were \\"mixture of cooperation and competition\\". He also admitted that he kept some of own work secret until his \\"hand was forced\\" by Shive's 1948 advance. =Phototransistor= In 1948 Shive invented the phototransistor that used a beam of light, instead of a wire, as the emitter of a point contact transistor, generating holes that flow to the collector. Bell Labs announced the invention in 1950. The phototransistor was eventually used in the nationwide direct distance dialing system. =Shive wave machine= PSSC Simple Waves film. The machine consists of 64 horizontal rods welded to an axle torsion bar that is perpendicular to the rods. Notice that the wave inverts as it reflects from each non-fixed end. Shive was a gifted lecturer, and became Director of Education and Training at Bell Telephone Laboratories. He was responsible for curriculum and administration of educational programs provided to employees of Bell Laboratories. In this new role, he invented the Shive wave machine (also known as the Shive wave generator). The wave generator illustrates wave motion using a series of steel rods joined by a thin torsion wire which transmits energy from one rod to the next. The high moment of inertia of each rod ensures the wave takes several seconds to traverse the entire series of rods, making the dynamics easily visible. The motion is analogous to high-frequency waves that are invisible to the human eye, such as electromagnetic waves on a transmission line. The wave generator could illustrate wave reflection, standing waves, resonance, partial reflection, and impedance matching. Shive made two educational films in which he demonstrated the machine, Simple Waves and Similarities in Wave Behavior, and wrote a book with the same name as the latter. Today, the Exploratorium Exhibit Services manufactures a large-scale version of the machine for use in science museums and schools. Patents Shive held several patents including Selenium rectifier and method of making it, Directly heated thermocouple, Photoresistive translating device, Selenium rectifier including tellurium and method of making it, Apparatus for and method of treating selenium rectifiers, Semiconductor photoelectric device, Conditioning of semiconductor translators, Semiconductor amplifier, and Alternating gate current. Books Shive authored three books during his career, beginning with The Properties, Physics, and Design of Semiconductor Devices (1959), a book about semiconductor devices. This was followed by Similarities of Wave Behavior (1961), a book designed to help college professors teach students about waves using the machine he invented. His last book, Similarities in Physics (1982), was coauthored with Robert L. Weber. He was also one of the editors of Transistor Technology, Volume 1. Honors John N. Shive was a fellow of the American Physical Society and a Senior Member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. He was also a chairman of the Advisory Committee on the Pre-College Physics Project of the American Institute of Physics. Personal life Shive was married to Helen Shive. Selected works * J. N.

Description The tree typically grows to a height of with a crown of up to about wide. E. megacornuta has the habit of a small tree or shrub with a smooth brown to grey-red and green trunk and smooth bark over the length of the trunk and branches. The dull, green, thick and concolorous adult leaves have a disjunct arrangement. The leaf blade has lanceolate to elliptic shape that is basally tapered. It produces large yellow-green flowers that occur from July to October in the species' native range. Each simple, axillary conflorescence is made up of three to seven flowered umbellasters on broadly flattened peduncles. The fruits or capsules are clustered and sessile on a flattened peduncle. They have a campanulate shape with one prominent rib with many weak ribs. The capsules are in length and wide with three exserted valves. Taxonomy The species was formally described by botanist Charles Austin Gardner in 1942 as part of the work Contributiones Florae Australiae Occidentalis as published in the Journal of the Royal Society of Western Australia. The type specimen was collected by Gardner in 1935 near Ravensthorpe. E. megacornuta is very similar in appearance to the closely related Beaufort Inlet Mallee (Eucalyptus newbeyi) and Burdett's mallee (Eucalyptus burdettiana). Distribution The species is found on hillsides and in creek beds along the south coast in the Great Southern and Goldfields- Esperance region of Western Australia between Albany and Hopetoun, particularly in the Ravensthorpe Range, where it grows in loamy alluvium soils over granite or laterite. Conservation status Eucalyptus megacornuta is listed as \\"endangered\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 but as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture The species is sold commercially in seed for or as tube stock, it grows well in full or par sun and is drought tolerant once established. A fast growing plant it can be used as an ornamental or privacy screening. The tree produces abundant nectar when it flowers so it is prized by apiarists and is a good bird attractor. The dried seed pods are also used in flower arrangements.

It is geothermally active and is being used to generate clean electric power. The region has an estimated potential of 2,000 MW. This is almost double the maximum daily electricity peak demand recorded in 2008/2009 for the entire country. Location The geothermal complex and power plants lie within the Hell's Gate National Park. The Olkaria volcanic area is about from Nairobi. It lies south of the Ol Doinyo Eburru complex and north of Mount Suswa; it is east of the rift valley's western margin and west of Mount Longonot, a stratovolcano. The volcanic field covers . The largest structure is Olkaria Hill, across and high. A narrow gorge that crosses the complex with cliffs up to high was formed by water flowing out of Lake Naivasha during a period in the past when water levels were much higher than today. Volcanism The surface at Olkaria is dominated by a peralkaline rhyolite dome and lava field. The complex contains many centers of volcanic activity that often erupt in small volumes. There are at least eighty such centers of activity, mostly either thick lava flows or steep-sided lava and pyroclastic domes. Rock from a borehole deep at Olkaria is around 450,000 years old., but the surface features are no more than 20,000 years old. The oldest exposed sequence is the Ol Njorowa pantellerite formation of pyroclastic rocks, lava flows and plugs. This is thought to be related to a caldera by that later collapsed but is indicated by traces of a ring fracture. The magma has a wide range of compositions representing the different phases after the caldera collapsed. Although dating is not precise, it seems that the older rocks date to 9,000 years before present, while the youngest rocks in the Olobutot formation are between 130 and 230 years old. Geothermal potential Olkaria lies within the Naivasha sub-basin, known for hot springs, hot grounds and fumaroles. Further north, Lake Bogoria has steam jets and geysers with temperatures as high as . There are steam fumaroles at Njorowa Gorge in Olkaria. In the underground reservoirs, temperatures of have been measured at nearby Eburru and at Olkaria. The geothermal production zones at Olkaria are at depths of between to , and further down at between to below the surface. Lake Naivasha underground water may be feeding the geothermal reservoir at Olkaria, which has caused concern since the lake has been shrinking in size recently. However the absence of tritium in the steam shows that the water is taking at least fifty years to travel from the lake, if that is indeed the source. Exploitation Power plant workers in Olkaria Maasai man at Olkaria - some communities have been displaced by the power generation projects The first geothermal exploration of Olkaria started in 1955. Two unsuccessful test wells had been drilled by 1959. Little more was done until 1967, when 27 shallow wells up to were drilled, some of which emitted steam. Starting in 1970 the Kenya Power Company (now the Kenya Electricity Generating Company, or KenGen) and the United Nations Development Programme began systematic efforts to survey and then exploit the geothermal potential. Production wells were drilled and commercial generation of electricity started in July 1981 with a plant built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries containing a 15 MW turbo-generator. A second 15 MW turbine came online in December 1982 and a third in March 1985, bringing total output up to 45 MW of which 3.3MW is used to power the station itself. Thirty production wells had been sunk by 1999 of which twenty-seven were productive, each yielding from 1.5 MW to 8 MW. Currently, 15 wells are being used to power the Olkaria I station. Following rising power demands, a third station, Olkaria II was built with a production capacity of 105 MW with 5.2 MW used to power the station itself. It is powered by 3 Mitsubishi turbines each capable of generating 35 MW. The steam is obtained from 22 wells each producing an estimated 35 tonnes of steam per hour. As of 2005 KenGen owned the Olkaria I (45 MW) and Olkaria II (70 MW) power plants. A third power station with 48 MW capacity, Olkaria III, is privately owned by a subsidiary of Ormat Technologies. The Olkaria III plant uses air-cooled converters, ensuring that there is no surface discharge. This new technology has the least impact on the environment of any power generated in Kenya. The project will probably qualify for carbon credits under the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism. In February 2010 Ormat announced plans to increase the capacity of their plant to as much as 100 MW. In 2005 KenGen was planning to build a fourth plant. An environmental and social impact assessment was approved by the National Environmental Management Authority, including resettlement of some Maasai communities. In December 2010 the European Investment Bank recommended providing partial financing for a project to expand Olkaria I and build Olkaria IV, adding 280 MW to its capacity. KenGen estimates that the area has a total potential of 2,000 MW.

Early life Born in Cornwall, England, in 1847 to miner and temperance lecturer Samuel Morcom, Sr. and Mary (n√©e Toy), the fifth of nine children, Morcom sailed with his family to South Australia on the Rajah, arriving at Port Adelaide on 24 September 1847. Morcom Snr. initially travelled to Reedy Creek to run a copper mine, then joined the Victorian gold rush before moving to Adelaide with his family, where he purchased a hotel in Hindley St, naming it \\"Morcom's Temperance Hotel\\". In Adelaide he was a leading member in the local tent of the teetotal Independent Order of Rechabites, which held its meetings at his hotel. Morcom Jnr. also became a staunch teetotaller, and was described as having \\"very steady habits\\". Cricket career Morcom began playing for Norwood Cricket Club in AdelaideLaunceston Examiner, \\"South Australia\\", 20 January 1888, p. 3. and soon became one of the leading cricketers in the colony, later being referred to as \\"the prettiest batsman of his time\\". Morcom played in the first ever match organised by the South Australian Cricket Association. Chosen in the \\"British born\\" team against the \\"Colonial born\\" team, the match commenced on 11 November 1872 at the Saint Peter's College Ground (the Adelaide Oval was not yet ready for matches). Morcom was one of three South Australians chosen in a combined colonies team (players from New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania) to play Victoria at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, starting Boxing Day 1872.Harte, pp. 35‚Äì36. This was subsequently recognised as a first-class match, meaning that Morcom was one of the first South Australians to play first-class cricket, as it would be five years before South Australia played their initial first-class match. The Australasian was not impressed with the quality of the South Australians, criticising their batting and bowling, and wrote that \\"Morcom, if he threw in better, would make a good long-leg or cover.\\"Harte, p. 36. While he remained a leading cricketer in the colony, Morcom was the subject of an anonymous letter to the South Australian Register, the leading local newspaper of the day, criticising his \\"playing for coin rather than love of the game.\\" Morcom hastily responded, stating that the only time in his career he had been paid to play cricket was the 1872 intercolonial match, and that was \\"only my bare expenses\\".\\"Letter to the Editor\\", South Australian Register, 28 January 1874, p. 5. Although living in Adelaide, Morcom was chosen in the Yorke's Peninsula XXII that played the touring WG Grace's English team in Kadina in 1873/74. Morcom scored one and, in the second innings, zero, as Yorke's Peninsula's twenty two scored 13 between them, which at that time was the lowest score against an English side. Despite his failure for Yorke's Peninsula, Morcom was picked in the first ever South Australian cricket team, which played WG Grace's XI at Adelaide Oval, starting on 26 March 1874. Morcom scored zero and six. Morcom continued to represent South Australian sides against interstate or international opponents throughout the 1870s, including matches against Victoria in 1874 and 1876, James Lillywhite's XI in 1876 and against a combined Australian side in 1877, without scoring higher than 18. Such was Morcom's popularity in Adelaide that he was featured in some of the earliest sports merchandise marketing in South Australia. One enterprising businessman created belts with a photograph of various leading cricketers and the words \\"South Australian celebrity\\". Morcom was one of seven players featured on the belts, with the Register of the belief that the belts were likely to be popular.\\"Cricket Belts\\", South Australian Register, 5 July 1878, p. 4. Personal life Morcom worked as a compositor in the Government Printing Office in Adelaide and on 24 February 1876 he married Ellen Bone at St Peter's Collegiate Chapel, Adelaide.South Australian Register, 25 February 1876, p. 7. Other members of the Morcom family also gained renown; brother John, under the name Vertelli, became a famous wire walker in the United States, brother James was a champion rifle shot and short-distance pedestrian, William was one of South Australia's top swimmers and Harry was South Australia's top backwards runner at a time when backwards running was a popular competition.A.V.M. \\"Sporting Families: Morcoms and Goodfellows\\". The South Australian Register, 14 December 1923, p. 3. =Death= Around noon on 7 January 1888, Morcom was crossing Rundle Street in Adelaide when he became giddy and stumbled between the wheels of an oncoming trolley, landing on his stomach. The trolley driver, a James Rossiter, was unaware of Morcom's situation and drove the trolley, with its five tonne payload, over Morcom, fracturing his left thigh. Morcom was taken to Royal Adelaide Hospital, where surgeons thought it unnecessary to amputate his left leg. In hospital, Morcom progressed favourably until early on the morning of 15 January, when his condition deteriorated; he died at 3.00 pm that afternoon. A coroner's inquiry into the death found that the cause of death was inflammation of the lining membrane of the heart, owing to the absorption of blood from the bruised parts of the thigh. Morcom's brother James testified that Morcom had been unwell recently and had been losing his eyesight.\\"Death of Mr. S. Morcom\\", The South Australian Register, 17 January 1888, p. 7.

It was situated in southeast London, on the south side of Woolwich Common, on the western slopes of Shooter's Hill, in the Royal Borough of Greenwich. Today the former hospital buildings form a residential development known as the Royal Herbert Pavilions. History The hospital was built on the authority of Sidney Herbert, responsible for sending Florence Nightingale to the Crimea, leader of War Office reforms after this campaign, and passionate about health care and reducing military mortality rates from diseases and ill-treated war wounds. Designed by chief architect Sir Douglas Galton (of the Royal Engineers), the hospital is notable for the design inputs of Nightingale (Galton's aunt and his cousin by marriage).History of the Building, Royal Herbert Pavilions.

Aerial view showing pavilion layout, 1866 It utilised a new approach to open planning, and was based on the revolutionary 'pavilion' design whereby each ward was connected to a central corridor to maximise daylight and fresh air intake. Nightingale explained: :\\"All the wards are raised on basements, those at the lower end of the ground are so lofty as to afford excellent accommodation‚Ä¶ Every ward has a large end window, commanding beautiful views.\\" Enclosed in 19 acres of landscaped gardens, and sitting adjacent to Woolwich Common and the ancient Oxleas Woods, the hospital quickly became a design figurehead for dozens more hospitals, both public and military. The revolutionary construction methods included the use of cavity wall construction, fireproof floors, and a system for heating incoming fresh air. Proving an appropriate response to Nightingale's reflection that: :\\"no ward is in any sense a good ward in which the sick are not at all times supplied with pure air, light and a due temperature. These are the results to be obtained from hospital architecture.\\" The building work of the hospital cost ¬£209,139 and the land purchase was ¬£6,394.Royal Herbert Hospital, Qaranc.co.uk.

Queen Victoria's visit in March 1900 The hospital was considered to be such a leap forward in design and patient treatment that a new Commission of 1883 congratulated it as \\"one of the best of the modern great hospitals\\". In 1900 Queen Victoria visited soldiers in the hospital who had been injured in the Boer War, and granted her Royal Patronage. World War service Basement Ward, 1941: watercolour by official war artist Edward Ardizzone The Royal Herbert Hospital was actively involved in the care of the wounded from the First World War and the Second World War. During the first, it was the location of Enid Bagnold's A Diary Without Dates when Bagnold was a V.A.D. there. During World War Two, the Royal Herbert Military Hospital admitted civilian patients when the nearby Royal Arsenal was bombed by the German Luftwaffe. Any downed pilots and navigators were taken as Prisoners of War (POWs) and treated for their injuries at the Royal Herbert, where a separate Luftwaffe officers and NCOs ward was set up. The hospital provided orthopaedic, general surgical and medical wards for army personnel and their families. At its peak the hospital had 15 wards which accommodated 650 beds. This included a guardroom and prison ward for 28 army prisoners.Unit History: Royal Herbert Hospital, Forces War Records. Retrieved: 18 October 2015. Closure and redevelopment Before it closed the hospital had become the Army's main orthopaedic centre and contained the Army schools for physiotherapy, x-rays, and medical clerks' and nurses' preliminary training. The hospital closed in 1977 and for a period of time became derelict. In 1986, American new wave band Animotion filmed the music video for their single I Engineer and Kate Bush filmed the video for Experiment IV in the then abandoned hospital. Demolition was thought likely, but as a Grade II listed building in the Woolwich Common Conservation Area it was preserved. In 1990, the empty and disused site was purchased by a property developer and developed into 228 luxurious flats and apartments called the Royal Herbert Pavilions. Completed in 1995, today's site incorporates a leisure club, private bar, tennis courts, swimming pool and outdoor nature reserve.

The company immediately hired a Milwaukee firm to design the building. Construction of the Richter Brewery proceeded from 1900 into 1901, and the Richter Brewery began manufacture in early 1901. Building and equipping the brewery cost $40,000. It was the second brewery in Escanaba. Over the next few years, additional buildings were constructed, including a keg house, office building, bottling plant, ice house and stable. All but the 1915 office building were demolished in 1929. The brewery closed at the beginning of Prohibition, and it was sold in 1925. The building was then used to manufacture non-alcoholic beverages. At the end of Prohibition, it was sold to the Delta Brewery Company. The building was again used to brew beer until the Delta Brewing Company went bankrupt in 1940. The building remained vacant until the late 2000s. The building was purchased in 2008 with the intention of renovating it into loft apartment space; it was split into fifteen loft apartments and three ground-floor commercial spaces.

After a short siege, the government garrison surrendered to a Jacobite force, which then moved on to besiege Fort William, using artillery captured at Fort Augustus. Background After the 1715 rising, a line of forts was built along what is now the Caledonian Canal: the three most important were Fort George, Inverness; Fort Augustus; and Fort William. Their garrisons were reinforced when the 1745 rising began, but the defences had been neglected and were in a poor state. However, it was not until the Jacobites retreated from Stirling Castle in February 1746 that a serious effort was made to capture them. Clark, pp. 362‚Äì363 Despite being well-supplied, Fort George surrendered without fighting; its governor, Major Grant, a close relative of the Jacobite Lord Lovat, was later court-martialled and dismissed. Clark, p. 371 The garrisons at Fort Augustus and Fort William had been raiding the surrounding countryside, much of which belonged to Lochiel and MacDonald of Keppoch. To protect their lands, they demanded that the forts be taken; on 21 February, a contingent of Irish regulars in the French Army under Colonel Walter Stapleton and 1,500 Cameron and MacDonald clansmen arrived outside Fort Augustus. The siege Fort Augustus and Loch Ness, from military road (foreground) Fort Augustus is at the south-west end of Loch Ness, at a key junction of the military roads constructed after 1715; built in 1729, the fort replaced a barracks known as Kilwhimen Barracks. Instead of being built on high ground, it was placed on a peninsula surrounded by Loch Ness and the Rivers Oich and Tarff. Cumberland felt it could not be defended for more than a few days, and wrote that Fort William was the only one of any importance. Clark, p. 371 Square in plan with angled bastions on each corner, the fort was designed \\"more ... for ornament than strength\\", as a demonstration of the government presence in the Scottish Highlands. The walls were weak, while the six-pounder guns that provided defensive fire were installed on top of the four bastions, in full view of an attacking force. The garrison consisted of three companies from Guise's Regiment, commanded by Major Hugh Wentworth. He lacked trained gunners and stationed one of his companies in the old Kiliwhimen Barracks, an isolated position to the south of the fort. This was quickly taken by the French regulars under Stapleton, and his engineer Grant began siege operations on 22 February 1746. According to an eye witness, the Jacobites had three batteries, one opposite the main gate and two firing from the north. These had little effect, with most of the damage being done by three coehorn mortars; on the first day, a shell from one of these blew up the fort's magazine, destroying one of its bastions. A second shot caused the explosion of another magazine the next day, but firing then continued for another four days without further impact. The garrison capitulated on 1 March without any casualties, and Wentworth was considered to have surrendered too early; he was subsequently court-martialled and dismissed from the army. Clark, p. 372 Aftermath Another drawing of the old fort c.1788 The Jacobites moved on to Fort William, the last government strong point along the Great Glen, a much stronger facility. The Siege of Fort William was abandoned in early April. References Sources Duffy, Christopher. (2007). The '45, Bonnie Prince Charlie and Untold Story of the Jacobite Rising.

In most mammalian species, sex hormones control the ability to engage in sexual behaviors. However, sex hormones do not directly regulate the ability to copulate in primates (including humans). Rather, sex hormones in primates are only one influence on the motivation to engage in sexual behaviours. Measuring sexual motivation Sexual motivation can be measured using a variety of different techniques. Self-report measures, such as the Sexual Desire Inventory, are commonly used to detect levels of sexual motivation in humans. Self-report techniques such as the bogus pipeline can be used to ensure individuals do not falsify their answers to represent socially desirable results. Sexual motivation can also be implicitly examined through frequency of sexual behaviour, including masturbation. Hormones =Testosterone= Journal of Zhejiang University‚ÄìScience, male testosterone levels exhibit a rhythm that corresponds to recent sexual activity. Testosterone appears to be a major contributing factor to sexual motivation in male primates, including humans. The elimination of testosterone in adulthood has been shown to reduce sexual motivation in both male humans and male primates. Male humans who had their testicular function suppressed with a GnRH antagonist displayed decreases in sexual desire and masturbation two weeks following the procedure. Research from male rhesus monkeys suggests testosterone functions to increase sexual motivation, thereby motivating males to compete for access to sexual partners. It is postulated that the motivating effects of testosterone in male rhesus monkeys promotes successful sexual competition and may be particularly important motivating tools for low ranking males. It is important to note that elimination of testosterone in primates does not reduce the ability to copulate; rather, it reduces the motivation to copulate. Testosterone levels in males have been shown to vary according to the ovulating state of females. Males who were exposed to scents of ovulating women recorded higher testosterone levels than males who were exposed to scents of nonovulating women. Being exposed to female ovulating cues may increase testosterone, which in turn may increase males' motivation to engage in, and initiate, sexual behaviour. Ultimately, these higher levels of testosterone may increase the reproductive success of males exposed to female ovulation cues. The relationship between testosterone and female sexual motivation is somewhat ambiguous. Research suggests androgens, such as testosterone, are not sufficient by themselves to prompt sexual motivation in females. In particular, studies with rhesus macaques have observed testosterone was not significantly associated with variations in level of sexual motivation in females. However, some research with nonhuman primates suggests a role for androgens in female sexual reproduction behaviour. Adrenalectomized female rhesus monkeys displayed diminished female sexual receptivity. Later studies revealed this diminished sexual receptivity was specific to the elimination of androgens that can be converted to estrogen. It is also suggested that levels of testosterone are related to the type of relationship in which one is involved. Men involved in polyamorous relationships display higher levels of testosterone than men involved in either a single partner relationship or single men. Polyamorous women have both higher levels of testosterone and score higher on measures of sexual desire than women who are single or women who are in single-partner relationships. =Estrogens and progesterone= Estrogens and progesterone typically regulate motivation to engage in sexual reproduction behaviour for females in mammalian species, though the relationship between hormones and female sexual motivation is not as well understood. In particular, estrogens have been shown to correlate positively with increases in female sexual motivation, and progesterone has been associated with decreases in female sexual motivation. The periovulatory period of the female menstrual cycle is often associated with increased female receptivity and sexual motivation. During this stage in the cycle, estrogens are elevated in the female and progesterone levels are low. At this time, mating is more likely to result in female pregnancy. Females at different stages of their menstrual cycle have been shown to display differences in sexual attraction. Heterosexual females not using birth control pills who are ovulating (high levels of estrogens) have a preference for the scent of males with low levels of fluctuating asymmetry. Ovulating heterosexual females also display preferences toward masculine faces and report greater sexual attraction to males other than their current partner. From an evolutionary perspective, increases in estrogens during fertile periods in females may direct sexual motivation toward males with preferential genes (the good genes hypothesis). Following natural or surgically induced menopause, many women experience declines in sexual motivation. Menopause is associated with a rapid decline of estrogen, as well as a steady rate of decline of androgens. The decline of estrogen and androgen levels is believed to account for the lowered levels of sexual reproduction desire and motivation in postmenopausal women, although the direct relationship is not well understood. In her memoir She's Not There: A Life in Two Genders, transgender woman Jennifer Finney Boylan wrote that taking estrogens and antiandrogens profoundly diminished her libido, and in transgender woman Julia Serano's memoir Whipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity, Serano wrote, in a section of her book she described as limited to hormonal changes that she said are experienced by many trans women she has spoken with, that a sharp decrease in her sex drive was the first thing she noticed when she started taking estrogens and antiandrogens. =Oxytocin and vasopressin= The hormones oxytocin and vasopressin are implicated in regulating both male and female sexual motivation. Oxytocin is released at orgasm and is associated with both sexual pleasure and the formation of emotional bonds.Hiller, J. (2005). Gender differences in sexual motivation. The journal of men's health & gender, 2(3), 339-345. Based on the pleasure model of sexual motivation, the increased sexual reproduction pleasure that occurs following oxytocin release may encourage motivation to engage in future sexual reproduction activities. Emotional closeness can be an especially strong predictor of sexual motivation in females and insufficient oxytocin release may subsequently diminish sexual reproduction arousal and motivation in females. High levels of vasopressin can lead to decreases in sexual motivation for females. A link between vasopressin release and aggression has been observed in females, which may impair female sexual reproduction arousal and sexual motivation by leading to feelings of neglect and hostility toward a sexual partner. In males, vasopressin is involved in the arousal phase. Vasopressin levels have been shown to increase during erectile response in male sexual reproduction arousal, and decrease back to baseline following ejaculation. The increase of vasopressin during erectile response may be directly associated with increased motivation to engage in sexual behaviour. =Nonprimate species= The hormonal influences of sexual motivation are much more clearly understood for nonprimate females. Suppression of estrogen receptors in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus in female rats has been observed to reduce female proceptivity and receptivity. Proceptivity and receptivity in the female rat are indicators of sexual motivation, thus indicating a direct relationship between estrogen levels and sexual motivation. In addition, female rats receiving doses of estrogen and progesterone were more likely to exert effort at gaining sexual reproduction attention from a male rat. The willingness of the female rats to access males was considered a direct measure of the females' levels of sexual motivation. An increase in vasopressin has been observed in female rats which have just given birth. Vasopressin is associated with aggressive and hostile behaviours, and is postulated to decrease sexual motivation in females. Vasopressin administered in the female rat brain has been observed to result in an immediate decrease in sexual motivation. Sexual orientation Little research has been conducted on the effect of hormones on reproduction motivation for same-sex sexual contact. One study observed the relationship between sexual motivation in lesbian and bisexual women and period-related changes in circulating estrogen concentrations. Lesbian women who were at the estrogen peak of their fertile cycle reported increased reproduction motivation for sexual contact with women, whereas bisexual women reported only a slight increase in same-sex motivated sexual contact during peak estrogen levels. Both lesbian and bisexual women showed decreases in reproduction motivation for other-sex sexual contact at peak estrogen levels, with greater changes in the bisexual group than the lesbian group. Clinical research =Men= * Testosterone is critical for sexual desire, function, and arousal in men. Aromatization of testosterone into the estrogen estradiol appears to be partially responsible for the effects of testosterone on sexual desire and function in men. 5Œ±-Reduction of testosterone into the more potent androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT) may have a small contribution to the effects of testosterone on sexual desire and function in men. Based on animal research, metabolites of DHT including the neurosteroids and weak estrogens 3Œ±-androstanediol and 3Œ≤-androstanediol may be involved in sexual function in men. * Men experience sexual dysfunction at testosterone levels of below 300 ng/dL, with men that have levels of testosterone of approximately 200 ng/dL often experiencing such problems. Complete loss of testicular testosterone production resulting in testosterone levels within the castrate range (95% decrease, to 15 ng/dL on average) with surgical or medical castration causes profound sexual dysfunction in men. Combined marked suppression of testicular testosterone production resulting in testosterone levels of just above the castrate/female range (70 to 80% decrease, to 100 ng/dL on average) and marked androgen receptor antagonism with high-dosage cyproterone acetate monotherapy causes profound sexual dysfunction in men. Treatment of men with medical castration and add-back of multiple dosages of testosterone to restore testosterone levels (to a range of about 200 to 900 ng/dL) showed that testosterone dose-dependently restored sexual desire and erectile function in men. High-dosage monotherapy with an androgen receptor antagonist such as bicalutamide or enzalutamide, which preserves testosterone and estradiol levels, has a minimal to moderate negative effect on sexual desire and erectile function in men in spite of strong blockade of the androgen receptor. * Estradiol supplementation maintains greater sexual desire in men with surgical or medical castration. High-dose estrogen therapy, which results in marked or complete suppression of testicular testosterone production such that testosterone levels are within the castrate range (95% decrease, to less than 50 ng/dL), causes decreased sexual desire and function. However, sexual function and activity appear to be significantly better with high-dose estrogen therapy than with surgical castration. Treatment of men with medical castration and add-back testosterone to restore testosterone levels, with or without the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole, showed that prevention of the conversion of testosterone into estradiol partially prevented restoration of sexual desire and erectile dysfunction by testosterone in men. However, this was not the case in another study with a similar design that used the aromatase inhibitor testolactone. Men with aromatase deficiency and estrogen insensitivity syndrome, and hence estrogen deficiency, appear to have normal sexual desire, function, and activity. However, estradiol supplementation in some men with aromatase deficiency increased sexual desire and activity but not in other men with aromatase deficiency. Treatment with the antiestrogenic selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) tamoxifen has been found to decrease sexual desire in men treated with it for male breast cancer. However, other studies have not found or reported decreased sexual function in men treated with SERMs including tamoxifen, clomifene, raloxifene, and toremifene. * 5Œ±-Reductase inhibitors, which block the conversion of testosterone into DHT, result in a slightly increased risk of sexual dysfunction with an incidence of decreased libido and erectile dysfunction of about 3 to 16%. Treatment of healthy men with multiple dosages of testosterone enanthate, with or without the 5Œ±-reductase inhibitor dutasteride, showed that dutasteride did not significantly influence changes in sexual desire and function. Treatment of men with high-dosage bicalutamide therapy, with or without the 5Œ±-reductase inhibitor dutasteride, showed that dutasteride did not significantly influence sexual function. Combined high-dosage bicalutamide therapy plus dutasteride showed less sexual dysfunction than medical castration similarly to high- dosage bicalutamide monotherapy. * Treatment of men with very high-dosage DHT (a non-aromatizable androgen), which resulted in an increase in DHT levels by approximately 10-fold and complete suppression of testosterone and estradiol levels, showed that none of the measures of sexual function were significantly changed with the exception of a mild but significant decrease in sexual desire. Treatment of hypogonadal men with the aromatizable testosterone undecanoate and the non-aromatizable mesterolone showed that testosterone undecanoate produced better improvements in mood, libido, erection, and ejaculation than did mesterolone. However, the dosage of mesterolone could have been suboptimal. =Women= * Estradiol seems to be the most important hormone for sexual desire in women. Periovulatory levels of estradiol increase sexual desire in women. Based on animal research, progesterone may also be involved in sexual function in women. Very limited clinical research suggests that progesterone does not increase sexual desire and may decrease it. There is little support for the notion that physiological levels of testosterone are important for sexual desire in women, although supraphysiological levels of testosterone can increase sexual desire in women similarly to the high levels in men. * There is little to no correlation between total testosterone levels within the normal physiological range and sexual desire in premenopausal women. Sexual desire is not increased in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in spite of high testosterone levels. Women with PCOS actually experience an improvement in sexual desire following treatment of their condition, likely due improved psychological functioning (e.g., body image). * Sexual desire is not decreased in women with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) relative to unaffected women in spite of a completely non- functional androgen receptor. Sexual desire is increased or unchanged in most women taking a combined birth control pill. This is in spite of the fact that almost all combined birth control pills contain the potently hepatotropic estrogen ethinylestradiol, and the typical doses of ethinylestradiol present in combined birth control pills increase sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels by 2- to 4-fold and consequently decrease free testosterone levels by 40 to 80%. However, there are some conflicting reports on the effects of combined birth control pills on sexual function in women. Progestogen-only birth control, such as with depot medroxyprogesterone acetate or the etonogestrel birth control implant, has shown mixed effects on sexual desire and function. Androgen receptor antagonists such as flutamide and bicalutamide cause little to no decrease in sexual desire in women. * Low dosages of testosterone that result in physiological levels of testosterone (< 50 ng/dL) do not increase sexual desire in women. High dosages of testosterone that result in supraphysiological levels of testosterone (> 50 ng/dL) significantly increase sexual desire in women, with levels of testosterone of 80 to 150 ng/dL \\"slightly\\" increasing sexual desire. Further higher dosages of testosterone may result in greater effects on sexual desire in women. High dosages of testosterone (with levels of > 50 ng/dL) have a risk of masculinization (e.g., acne, hair growth, voice changes) with long-term therapy in women. High dosages of testosterone but not low dosages of testosterone enhance the effects of low dosages of estrogens on sexual desire. Tibolone, a combined estrogen, progestin, and androgen, may increase sex drive to a greater extent than standard estrogen‚Äìprogestogen therapy in postmenopausal women. =Transgender individuals= * Testosterone therapy increases sexual desire and arousal in transgender men. Estradiol and antiandrogen therapy decreases sexual desire and arousal in transgender women. However, treatment with estradiol in transgender women who have undergone surgical castration appears to maintain significantly greater sexual desire and activity than would be expected for surgical castration alone.

It was a part of the original South Sudan Liberation Movement, the first Sudanese secessionist movement. Its name was taken from the Greek Azania, the Greek designation for the lands of East Africa south of Nubia. The organisation was formed after February 1965 when the SANU split into two sectors, the home and foreign. The home sector was led by William Deng Nhial, it sat in the Parliament on the issue of South Sudan's right to self-determination. The foreign sector was directed by Aggrey Jaden Ladu, who had fled to Kampala in Uganda. In November 1964 Joseph Oduho, the first president of SANU, after losing a bid for presidency of the group to Jaden left and in so doing, split the organization. On March 1965 Oduho formed his own organization, the Azania Liberation Front; Jaden then renamed his faction of SANU loyalists, the Sudan African Liberation Front. In June of the same year the two factions reached a settlement and by the end of 1965 they had decided to reunite under as the Azania Liberation Front with Oduho as the president and Aggrey Jaden as vice president. In 1967 they headed the National Transitional Government of South Sudan (formed on August 15, 1967). On 15 August 1967 was a called Provisional Government of Southern Sudan, SSNPG (1967‚Äì1969) chaired by Aggrey Jaden, who gave way (March 1969) the Provisional Government of the State of the Nile.

He was known also for contributing articles to Rees's Cyclop√¶dia. Biography William Blair was born in 1766 in Lavenham, Suffolk. He was the youngest son of William Blair, M.D., and his wife Ann Gideon. He qualified as a surgical practice in London under Mr. J. Pearson of Golden Square, who introduced him to the London Lock Hospital, and when a vacancy arose he was given a position as a surgeon to that charity. Blair was an M.A. but it is not known where he graduated. He became very eminent in his profession, and was surgeon to the Asylum, the Finsbury Dispensary, the Bloomsbury Dispensary for the Relief of the Sick Poor in Great Russell Street, the Female Penitentiary at Cumming House, Pentonville, and the New Rupture Society. He was a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, London, and of the medical societies of London, Paris, Brussels, and Aberdeen. For some time he was editor of the London Medical Review and Magazine. Blair was a keen Methodist, and worked in the cause of the British and Foreign Bible Society, to which he presented his valuable collection of rare and curious editions of the Bible, and many scarce commentaries in different languages. He attempted lectures on anatomy and other subjects, but with little success. On his wife's death in March 1822 he resolved to give up professional practice, and to retire into the country. He took a house in the neighbourhood of Colchester, but before the preparations for removing were completed he was seized with illness, and died at his residence in Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury on 6 December 1822. William Blair's portrait was painted by and presented to the Bloomsbury Dispensary by Henry Meyer. Ciphers and stenography Blair was greatly interested in ciphers and stenography, and wrote articles about the subject in Rees's Cyclop√¶dia. David Kahn, in his work The Code breakers (1967),David Kahn, The Codebreakers: The Story of Secret Writing (New York: The Macmillan Company, 1967),788, characterized Blair's \\"superb article\\" as \\"the finest treatise in English on cryptology\\" until Parker Hitt's military manual was published by the U.S. Army in 1916. Blair's article on ciphers from the American edition of the Cyclopedia has been digitized and can be linked from the website about the Beale ciphers.

Extent References to \\"forest\\" in Domesday Book suggest that the forest was of similar extent in 1086 and in the 14th century. Its precise extent in the intervening period can only be deduced from the places summoned to attend forest courts in the 13th century or which were declared disforested in whole or part in the Great Perambulation of 1300. At its greatest extent its boundaries met those of Feckenham Forest on the southeast and Morfe Forest on the northwest. However, it probably included Wolverley and Kidderminster, which were not in the post-1300 forest. It stretched north to Lower Penn and Seisdon and thus occupied much of the lower stour and Smestow valleys,ed. J. Birrell, The Forests of Cannock and Kinver: select documents 1235-1372 (Staffordshire Record Society, 4th series 18, 1999), 4. stretching west to the Shropshire boundary and east approximately to the road from Worcester to Stafford, through Stourbridge and Wolverhampton. To its east was Pensnett Chase of the lords of Dudley. In the 13th century, Worcester Cathedral Priory was authorised to appoint its own officers to keep the woods in Wolverley, which weakened the impact of the forest law on that manor. Under the Great Perambulation of 1300, the bounds were greatly reduced. The new area seems to have consisted just of the parish of Kinver with Ashwood Hay in Kingswinford parish and Chasepool Hay. These hays (together with Iverley Hay (in Kinver) were hedged hunting areas. The manor of Kingsley, near Tettenhall remained a detached part of the forest and of the manor of Kinver. It is called the Hay of Kingesley in 1358.'Inquisition de statu foreste, Kinver, 1266' in Birrell, 216. Officers The wardenship of the forest was an office annexed to the manor of Kinver and Stourton, which was held from the king by a rent of ¬£9 per year and the serjeanty keeping the forest. A separate office of Riden of the forest occurs from 1388.Calendars of Patent Rolls. The office of bailiff of Ashwood Hay was also hereditary, the farm of Prestwood being held by the performance of this office. The herbage, pannage and other perquisites of Chasepool Hay was granted to John Sutton, 1st Baron Dudley in 1454. His grandson Edward Sutton, 2nd Baron Dudley was made Lieutenant of the Forest on his death in 1487. He was succeeded both in the Lieutenancy and in custody of Chasepool Hay by the Duke of Norfolk, who was in turn succeeded by John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland. This reverted to the crown on his attainder in 1553. When his ancestral estates were restored to Edward Sutton, 4th Baron Dudley, he was granted Chasepool and Ashwood Hays,Victoria County History, Staffordshire, XX, 208-9. though not Prestwood. This led to a dispute between his son and Gilbert Lyttelton as owner of Prestwood, over the boundary between Ashwood Hay and Prestwood Hill at the end of the century. Iverley Hay had a keeper in the 16th century.Victoria County History, Staffordshire, XX, 142. In addition, the forest had the usual verderers and regarders.

The election used the eleven wards created under the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004, with 36 councillors being elected. Each ward elected either 3 or 4 members, using the STV electoral system. After the 2007 Local Election a coalition was formed between the Alliance for Independents group and the Scottish National Party. This arrangement subsequently broke up and the Independent group formed a minority administration with the support of the Scottish Liberal Democrats. The 2012 election saw Independent Councillors remain the largest grouping on the Council while the Scottish National Party increased their representation again by 3 seats, chiefly at the expense of the Lib Dems. The Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party gained an additional seat and replaced the Lib Dems in third place according to vote share. Following the election an administration was formed between the Scottish National Party and the Argyll First Group of Independent Councilors. However, this coalition subsequently broke down, and after the SNP National Executive prevented the SNP group forming a coalition with the Scottish Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, 4 members of the SNP group including Roddy McCuish, Mary Jean Devon, Michael Breslin and Robert MacIntyre left the SNP, and a coalition of Independents, Scottish Conservatives, and Liberal Democrats was subsequently formed in October 2013, led by Dick Walsh.

This distillery was destroyed by a flood in 1829, and was rebuilt in 1835 in the outbuildings of a farmhouse by John Innes, and officially founded under the name Lyne of Ruthrie The distillery went bankrupt, and Lyne of Ruthrie was sold to William Smith. Smith changed the name of the distillery to the present name Benrinnes before selling the property to David Edward who ran the distillery until his son Alexander Edward took over operation of the distillery. In 1887 Alfred Barnard described the distillery in his work The Whisky Distilleries of the United Kingdom. At this time the distillery had two stills, a wash still with a capacity of 1080 gallons, and a spirit still of 1004 gallons. In 1896 the distillery was damaged in a fire. It was rebuilt and modernised; the distillery converted to be powered by electricity. The distillery was sold to John Dewar & Sons in 1922. Under Dewars it was rebuilt in 1955, replacing the malting floors with a Saladin box, and ending the farming activities on the site. The distillery was expanded in 1966, adding three stills to the three present stills, which were all converted to internal heating in 1970. In 1974 Benrinnes changed its distillation process to a partial triple distillation process. The distillery stopped producing its own malt in 1984 opting to buy malt on the market instead, and removed its saladin box. The triple distillation process was abandoned in 2007, when it switched to a more common configuration of two wash stills and four spirit stills. Production Benrinnes employed some unusual production techniques. Between 1974 and 2007 the distillery used a unique partial triple distillation process. In this process the feints from the wash still, the weaker parts of feints of the spirit still, and the feints from the low wine still itself are distilled in a low wines still, while the spirit still is fed by the foreshots and the heart of the wash and low wine still, and its own foreshots and strong feints. The necks of the stills are cooled by worm tubs, a technique that is no longer very common. Benrinnes produces one fifteen-year-old semi-official bottling in the Flora and Fauna range since 1991.

Christian Bengali William Carey's translation of the Bible into Bengali was peculiar to mainstream Bengali. It came to be known as \\"Christian Bengali\\" and intelligibility of this new dialect was somewhat restricted to educated Bengali Christians. The Bengali converts to Christianity during the British rule were mainly lower Caste Hindus and this translation of the Bible to \\"Christian Bengali\\" was prohibited to be revised in fear of Sanskritisation. The dialect has become the language of Christian worship and Bengali Christian literature, but restricted to this small community; and therefore not allowing non-Christian Bengalis to understand. It is said to have been influenced by the works of the earlier Portuguese missionaries in Bengal who also established a Christianised Bengali dialect which lasted for roughly 150 years, before the establishment of Fort William College and rise of Anglo- Christian Bengali. The Portuguese settlers also inspired the use of a Portuguese dialect, known as Bengali Portuguese creole, which is no longer intact.

It first published in 1854 and ceased in 2019. The final publisher was Angus County Press Ltd, a company within the Scotland and North East England division of JPIMedia. History The first issue of The Buteman, A General Advertiser for the Western Isles was published on 13 December 1854 from premises in 23 High Street in Rothesay, the only town on the island. In the 20th century the paper's offices had several moves: to Moodie's Court, then to Montague Street, and then Castle Street where staff were located until 2002. The paper was printed on the island until 1980. In 1981 the paper was taken into ownership by Goldenbolt International. In November 1997 Score Press, the newspaper division of Scottish Radio Holdings, acquired the title for ¬£300,000. In 2006 it was sold to Johnston Press. In 2015 the paper was selling 1800 to 2000 copies each week. Following the announcement by the local authority that Rothesay would be taking Syrian refugees, there were comments left on the paper's website. The editor Craig Borland responded by writing an editorial in defence of welcoming the rufugees and won praise for this community leadership. In 2018 the owners Johnston Press went into administration and JPI media took the title over. The two remaining staff for the paper were based in Edinburgh. The last audited circulation figures of 730 were in 2018 and the population of Bute the previous year was 6,144. Circulation dropped further to 500 and JPI Media announced closure of the paper.

Personal life Her father's name was Rolf, her mother is Ruth, Jennifer grew up with her younger sister Svenja in Zollbr√ºck/R√ºderswil in the canton of Bern in Switzerland. Her Godparents are from Cyprus, therefore she often spends her holidays there. She visited the Graduate School of Business in Neuveville and successfully concluded her Professional Maturity of Commerce. In Basel she played football semi-professionally and worked as receptionist in the FC Basel administrative offices. Her intention for the future is to study either sport psychology or food science. Club career Oehrli started her children's football as seven- year-old, playing in the same boys team as her cousin. She played as striker in the youth teams of FC Zollbr√ºck and was soon called up to play for the U-14 regional selection team Bern/Jura. Because there were not enough Goalkeepers in the selection team she played in goal and at the club she played as striker. Even at this early age she was equally skilled with both feet. After seven years playing in Zollbr√ºck she received an offer from the women's football club SC Worb to play as Goalkeeper in their U-18 youth team. Just one year later, as Worb's first team achieved promotion to the Swiss National League B (NLB), she was asked to join the Ladies team. At just sixteen years of age she played the entire season in the NLB. A year later Oehrli signed for FFC Zuchwil 05 in the Nationalliga A. While at Zuchwil, she obtained international experience, playing in the Women's Champions League 2006‚Äì07 and 2007‚Äì08. In the 2006-2007 season Oehrli won the Swiss Championship and the Liga-Cup with her new club and they were Championship runners-up the following year. After three years playing for Zuchwil she moved to FC Thun Frauen and one year later to FC Basel Frauen. She scored her first goal in the Swiss National League A (NLA) with a Penalty kick in the 10-0 home win against GC Z√ºrich Frauen in the last game of the 2010-2011 season on 22 May 2011. At the end of the 2012-13 season Basel were Championship runners-up and Cup finalists. In June 2013 it was announced that Oehrli had transferred to BV Cloppenburg women team. International career Oehrli played her international debut for the Swiss national team in the 0-4 defeat against the Netherlands in an international Tournament on 3 March 2010. After Marisa Brunner retired from international football, Oehrli was nominated as the new number 1 in the Swiss team. She played her first game as number 1 during the 0-2 defeat against France on 5 May 2010. During the match in the 2013 Cyprus Cup on 13 March 2013 against New Zealand she suffered a fractured forearm.

Its flagship product is the OpenShift Container Platform ‚Äî an on-premises platform as a service built around Docker containers orchestrated and managed by Kubernetes on a foundation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. The family's other products provide this platform through different environments: OKD serves as the community-driven upstream (akin to the way that Fedora is upstream of Red Hat Enterprise Linux), OpenShift Online is the platform offered as software as a service, and Openshift Dedicated is the platform offered as a managed service. The OpenShift Console has developer and administrator oriented views. Administrator views allow one to monitor container resources and container health, manage users, work with operators, etc. Developer views are oriented around working with application resources within a namespace. OpenShift also provides a CLI that supports a superset of the actions that the Kubernetes CLI provides.  History  OpenShift originally came from Red Hat's acquisition of Makara \\\\- a company with a proprietary PaaS solutionbased on Linux containers.https://blog.openshift.com/red-hat-chose-kubernetes-openshift/ Even though OpenShift was announced in May 2011, it was proprietary technology and did not become open-source until May of 2012. Up until v3, the container technology and container orchestration technology used custom developed technologies. This changed in v3 with the adoption of Docker as the container technology, and Kubernetes as the container orchestration technology. The v4 product has many other architectural changes - a prominent one being a shift to using CRI-O as the container runtime (and Podman for interacting with pods and containers), and Buildah as the container build tool, thus breaking the exclusive dependency on Docker.  Architecture  The main difference between OpenShift and vanilla Kubernetes is the concept of build-related artifacts. In OpenShift, such artifacts are considered first class Kubernetes resources upon which standard Kubernetes operations can apply. OpenShift's client program, known as \\"oc\\", offers a superset of the standard capabilities bundled in the mainline \\"kubectl\\" client program of Kubernetes. Using this client, one can directly interact with the build-related resources using sub-commands (such as \\"new-build\\" or \\"start-build\\"). In addition to this, an OpenShift-native pod build technology called Source-to-Image (S2I) is available out of the box. For the OpenShift platform, this provides capabilities equivalent to what Jenkins can do. Some other differences when OpenShift is compared to Kubernetes: # The v4 product line uses the CRI-O runtime - which means that docker daemons are not present on the master or worker nodes. This improves the security posture of the cluster. # The out-of-the-box install of OpenShift comes included with an image repository. # ImageStreams (a sequence of pointers to images which can be associated with deployments) and Templates (a packaging mechanism for application components) are unique to OpenShift and simplify application deployment and management. # The \\"new-app\\" command which can be used to initiate an application deployment automatically applies the app label (with the value of the label taken from the --name argument) to all resources created as a result of the deployment. This can simplify the management of application resources. # In terms of platforms, OpenShift used to be limited to Redhat‚Äôs own offerings but now supports others like AWS, IBM Cloud and vSphere with OpenShift 4.https://thechief.io/c/editorial/kubernetes-vs- openshift-what-you-need-know # OpenShift‚Äôs implementation of Deployment, called DeploymentConfig is logic-based in comparison to Kubernetes' controller-based Deployment objects.https://thechief.io/c/editorial/kubernetes-vs-openshift-what-you-need- know. As of v4.5, OpenShift is steering more towards Deployments by changing the default behavior of its CLI. OpenShift introduced the concept of routes - points of traffic ingress into the Kubernetes cluster. The Kubernetes ingress concept was modeled after this. OpenShift also provides value adds by bundling various software solutions - application runtimes as well as infrastructure components from the Kubernetes ecosystem. For example, for observability needs, Prometheus, Hawkular, and Istio (and their dependencies) are included out of the box. The console UI includes an \\"Operator Hub\\" which serves as a marketplace from where publicly provided operator-based solutions can be downloaded and deployed.

It is a striking minimalist composition, an 18m by 9m glass box, encased on two sides by rusted metal screens, that cantilevers 5.5m over a steep slope at the front of the block. It is a significant award-winning early project by Godsell, who became an acclaimed local architect, and was published internationally.  Biography  Sean Godsell was born in Melbourne in 1960, the son of David Godsell who was a prominent local architect, who completed a number of notable homes in the bayside area of Melbourne in the 1960s in the idiom of Frank Lloyd Wright. Graduating in the 1980s, and establishing his own practice in 1994, Godsell has always insisted on the traditions of Modernism, unlike his peers who trained when Postmodernism held sway.  Design approach  alt= According to the International Architecture Year Book published in 2000, the Kew House \\"speculates on the emergence of an Australian vernacular born not simply from our colonial history but also from our acceptance of our regional reality as part of Asia.\\", that is, an architecture which is a hybrid of east and west. For instance, the open plan divided by sliding panels is eastern, while the long kitchen table, 'the altar of the Australian family' is western. In addition, Godsell states that \\"Although apparently 'modern' in its language, the house is primordial in its intent - rust, oiled second hand boards, recycled decking and a lack of 'precious' detail combine, with rudimentary services to form a house which is elemental rather than processed.\\" The cantilever, which he describes as the 'heroic nature of the structure', is a reference to the post-war optimism of houses in suburbs such as Kew, North Balwyn and Beaumaris. For instance in the nearby Studley modern precinct, there are a number of houses cantilevered or propped over sloping sites, usually with carparks underneath, such as the 1961 Guss House at 18 Yarra Street. =Plan= alt= The Japanese-influenced floor plan has no corridors; the continuous flow of space is divided only by the kitchen/bathroom and a long central wall housing a fireplace and cupboards, and sliding screens between the row of bedrooms and study on the south side. In the 1999 ABC documentary series In the Mid of the Architect, Godsell said regarding the plan : ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a symbolic gesture as well as a pragmatic one, but it forces a socialization that we need to deal with as a society in Australia. It forces tolerance within the house.\\" His wife noted that \\"probably the most affronting thing to most people would be the lack of perceived privacy, but I don‚Äôt find it at all confrontational. I find it a very comforting, nurturing home.\\" =Interior= The furniture and artworks were carefully chosen, designed and arranged. The east end of the house, next to the kitchen bench, is dominated by a 7m-long built-in table that was designed as the hub of life and daily activities in the home. The artworks are not hung on walls, but freestanding, or propped against the internal wall or the backs of the sofas. Godsell designed the solid, timber backed sofas (a tribute to Donald Judd), which are flanked by an Akari standing light by Noguchi and a sculpture by Pilar Rojas. =Sustainable design techniques= The external screens on the north and west sides shade the windows from direct summer sun, while sections can be lifted to allow sunlight to warm the living spaces on colder days. Cool air can be circulated through the house through a passive system that takes the prevailing south westerly wind over the front grass embankment under the house where it flows through the floor vents to the east end of the building. A fine water mist spray, placed at the top end of the embankment, can cool down the air further. = Addition = Between 2009 and 2013, a freestanding 24sqm studio was added. It is designed in dialog with but also in opposition to the original house; as stated on Godsell's website, they are 'connected by their common materiality of oxidised steel and recycled hardwood flooring, but are physically separate', and is ' deliberately solid and dark in comparison to the light filled and screened earlier house', and 'vertical, where the existing house is horizontal.' The addition won the 2014 National Award for Small Projects from the Australian Institute of Architects.

It was previously considered to be the same species as the closely related P. susterai which were lumped as P. fuscus and this means that some early observations of behaviour are not applicable to either species. Even now the two species need close observation under a microscope or hand lens to distinguish them from each other. Biology Little is known about the nests of P. perturbator but other Priocnemis species generally use preexisting cavities in which they may excavate several cells. P. perturbator is univoltine and the flight period is from May to September. As stated in the introduction, many of the observations of P. perturbator collecting prey refer to the invalid taxon P. fuscus, but this species is thought to take larger spiders of the families Lycosidae and Gnaphosidae. Females have been seen on the ground, apparently searching for prey. The spider Trochosa terricola is a known prey item. This species is one of a handful of relatively large spider wasps, including Priocnemis susterai and Anoplius viaticus which overwinter as adults in Britain, emerging in the following spring. Priocnemis perturbator, which is reasonably common and has long antennae, can often be seen nectaring on wood spurge, dandelion, blackthorn, hawthorn and willow. Habitat This species can be found in open woodland, but and various other habitats, so long as they are not waterlogged. Distribution P. perturbator is widespread, from Great Britain and Ireland into central and northern Europe and Asia eastwards to Japan.

Career De Rome volunteered in 1943 for the Royal Air Force and served in France, Belgium and Germany in World War II. Returning to civilian life in 1947, he started an acting career with the Birmingham Repertory Theatre, then switched to films, becoming a publicist, first with J. Arthur Rank, then with Sir Alexander Korda and later with David O. Selznick for whom he worked on The Third Man (1949) in Vienna, and then on Terminal Station (1953) in Rome (released in the U.S. as Indiscretion of an American Wife).Peter de Rome profile, IMDB.com; accessed 28 June 2014. In 1956, he emigrated to the U.S. and first joined Tiffany & Company as a salesman, then left in 1963 to work in the Civil Rights Movement in the south with his good friend, actress Madeleine Sherwood. During this period, he made his first movie, a short documentary entitled New Orleans. Returning to New York, he made a succession of gay erotic shorts culminating with Hot Pants, which won a first prize in 1971 at the Wet Dream Film Festival in Amsterdam. This in turn led to a suggestion from producer Jack Deveau to select eight of de Rome's movies to be released commercially as The Erotic Films of Peter de Rome. These shorts opened to critical acclaim at Lincoln Center in NYC, and later ran successfully in most large cities across the U.S. In 1974, de Rome went to Paris to make his first full-length feature entitled Adam & Yves, which was followed in 1976 by The Destroying Angel, an exercise in gay horror, supposedly based on Edgar Allan Poe, and using a title similar to Exterminating Angel (1962) by Luis Bu√±uel. However, with the advent of HIV/AIDS in the early 80s, de Rome ceased making movies. During this time de Rome worked in publicity for Paramount Pictures, retiring in 1989. In 1997 de Rome became a U.S. citizen. His films had never been shown in the UK, but in 2007 under a new government, the British Film Institute (BFI) requested a selection of de Rome's films to be held in their Archive and to be shown later that year at the London Lesbian & Gay Film Festival. This program included a 45-minute documentary made by David McGillivray called Peter de Rome: Grandfather of Gay Porn, and proved so successful that the BFI released the whole program on DVD. A full-length documentary entitled Peter de Rome: Grandfather of Gay Porn was produced in de Rome's 90th year. The film was screened at the Sheffield Documentary Festival. He fell ill and died at his home in Sandwich, Kent on 21 June 2014, a week before his 90th birthday.

She participated in a notable cutting out expedition and in 1807 in the second of the British invasions of the R√≠o de la Plata; she was wrecked in 1808. Origins Flying Fish was purchased in the West Indies and no record of the vessel or the transaction reached the Admiralty in London. Unusually, the acquirers gave her the same name as that of another vessel in the area, . The pre-existing Flying Fish received a name change to Firefly in 1807, but was wrecked that same year. The new Flying Fish may have been commissioned under Lieutenant H.G. Massie, but if so, command quickly transferred to Lieutenant James Glassford Gooding. Service Admiral James R. Dacres, commander-in-chief of the Jamaica station, formed a small squadron on 25 August 1806 under the command of Captain George Le Geyt of the 18-gun Stork. The other three vessels in the squadron were Flying Fish under Gooding, , and the 4-gun schooner . Dacres ordered Le Geyt to bring out or destroy privateers based at Batabano in Cuba. On 30 August the squadron approached the Isle of Pines. There they sighted a Spanish schooner at anchor. Le Geyt reinforced Pike with a lieutenant and eight seamen and sent her to engage the Spanish vessel. After a short chase and two broadsides from Pikes 12-pounder carronades, the Spaniard surrendered. She turned out to be a guarda costa of 10 guns, with a crew of 45 men. Pike took possession of her and took her back to the squadron.James 1837), Vol. 4, 258-60. Le Geyt then discovered that Stork drew too much water to permit her to enter the Gulf of Bataban√≥. He therefore transferred to the other three vessels his boats and men and sent in the cutting-out expedition under the command of Lieutenant Edward Rushworth, captain of Superieure. The landing party consisted of 63 officers and men. Ten men from Flying Fish remained to guard the party's boats. The party landed on 2 September and crossed some two miles of marshy ground to storm a fort at Batabano. On their way they had to break through an ambush of enemy soldiers and militia. In the process they killed two and wounded one badly. At the fort they captured six 18-pounder long guns, which they spiked. The party then proceeded to take possession of the vessels in the bay. There is some disagreement as to how many vessels they captured and took as prizes, with the total rising as high as 12. According to Rushworth's letter (an after action report), the prizes included a felucca, pierced for 14 guns but only mounting one 18-pounder, a schooner pierced for 12 guns, a French 4-gun privateer, and three Spanish privateers of one gun each. The party also burnt at least six smaller coasting vessels after having removed their cargoes. Total British casualties amounted to one man badly wounded. A later accounting reported that in all cases the crews of the captured vessels escaped. Flying Fish was at Spithead on 7 November 1806 when Admiral George Murray took command of the naval forces involved in the operations to capture Buenos Aires, supporting General John Whitelocke's soldiers.Grainger (1996), p.140. Murray and the naval forces were for the most part limited to conveying troops, and subsequently organising their evacuation. The Spanish colonists, though discontented with Spanish rule, were not disposed to accept British rule. They rose against the soldiers who landed, and took them prisoners. By 24 November Flying Fish and the rest of the naval force were at Saint Helena.Grainger (1996), p.147. From there they traveled to Table Bay, Cape of Good Hope, from where Murry wrote that the fleet was very healthy and that he had had to send only one man to hospital, a seaman from Flying Fish, for a fracture.Grainger (1996), p. 269. The fleet left the Cape on 6 April, but on 8 April Flying Fish sailed back to Saint Helena with dispatches for onward transfer to Britain.Grainger (1996), opp. 278-9. By 27 May she had rejoined the fleet, now at Montevideo, and from then on she was employed in liaison duty, reconnaissance, and transporting senior commanders in support of the operation.Grainger (1996), pp.282-3, 285, 287, 292, 298, 300, and 308. By 8 July Flying Fish was with the squadron off Buenos Aires.Grainger (1996), p.311. Around 10 September Flying Fish sailed with the fleet back to Britain.Grainger (1996), p.329. On 16 April 1808 Flying Fish sailed for Jamaica. She reached Barbados on 10 July with dispatches from Cadiz.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 20, p.148. Fate In December 1808 Flying Fish was sailing along the coast of San Domingo, working her way towards Port Royal, Jamaica, with a schooner in tow, a prize that she had taken. As the weather worsened, Gooding sailed closer to shore. When breakers were sighted ahead, he attempted to turn Flying Fish, but was unable to do so before she grounded. Although the strike was gentle, water poured in and Flying Fish was quickly turned on her side. The prize came in and removed all the men on Flying Fish. The subsequent court martial reprimanded the master for failing to take frequent depth soundings as the vessels approached shore, and admonished Gooding not to sail so close to shore in the future.

The toughness (resistance to breakage) of Emerald is classified as generally poor, hence most emeralds are highly included. =Gemstone= Emerald is a green gemstone. Emerald means the shade of green color. Because of its green color, the term Emerald is employed. Emerald is also associated with the eighth planet Mercury in the Solar System. Lord Budha (Devanagari: ‡§¨‡•Å‡§ß ) (Tamil: ‡Æ™‡ØÅ‡Æ§‡Æ©‡Øç) is considered as the god of the planet Mercury. According to Hindu mythology Lord Budha is considered as one among the nine Navagrahas. He represents green color and gemstone emerald. He is also the god of merchandise and protector of merchants.

The kings and emperors considered that the statues carved using emerald stones have divine power. They also considered that the emerald stone is free from faults (doshas). Worshiping Lord Siva in the form of emerald Lingam will remove all miseries and sins (doshas) and will also bring prosperity, improve health, enhance learning (education) and may give chance to have acquaintance with king or the ruler. Saptha Vitanga Shrines It is learned that the Chola emperor Musukuntha (12th Century) got seven emerald Siva Lingams from Lord Indra, the King of the Devas, God of Weather and War. (Devanagari: ‡§á‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞ or ‡§á‡§Ç‡§¶‡•ç‡§∞),(Tamil:‡Æá‡Æ®‡Øç‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æ∞‡Æ©‡Øç ‡Æé‡Æ©‡Øç‡Æ± ‡Æ§‡Øá‡Æµ‡Øá‡Æ®‡Øç‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æ∞‡Æ©‡Øç). Lord Indra was worshiping these seven emerald Siva Lingams. The emperor never wanted to worship the icon for himself and felt that it was appropriate to install these icons for the worship of his subjects (the common people). Accordingly, he made arrangements to install them in seven important Siva Temples located at Nagapattinam, Thirukaravasal, Thirukuvalai, Thirunallar and Thiruvaymur, VedaranyamVedaranyam.

He is known as one of the founders of the Pulchri Studio and made watercolors, etchings and woodcuts as well as paintings, mostly of cityscapes and church interiors. In 1857 he won his first golden medal at an exhibition in the Hague. In the late 1860s he began to restore paintings, possibly because he suffered from agoraphobia, which hindered him in the last decade of his life. Johannes Huygens was his pupil.

He was a self-taught painter who would later go on to give private lessons to Kaiser Wilhelm II. German Kaiser Wilhelm II took a liking to Bohrdt and would fund all of his projects, which were often nationalistic in nature. In 1915 Bohrdt created his most famous illustration which is called \\"The Last Man\\". The image shows a German navy officer holding up a German flag as his ship sinks during the Battle of the Falkland Islands Epkenhans, Michael, Hillmann, J√∂rg & N√§gler, Frank Jutland: World War I's Greatest Naval Battle University Press of Kentucky, 23 Sep 2015 because he would rather go down with the ship than surrender. \\"The Last Man\\" would become one of the most widely recognized propaganda images used during the war to inspire courage. Bohrdt was accepted into the Imperial Yacht Club in Kiel. In 1906 the Kaiser granted Bohrdt a spacious villa in Berlin. After World War I, Bohrdt made a living drawing maritime postcards, book illustrations, magazines, and supplied images for newspaper articles. Illustration by Hans Bohrdt, 1900 Personal life Bohrdt was born to a comfortably well-off middle-class family. His parents were Adolph Eduard Bohrdt and Rosalie Pauline Szymkowski, and he was one of 7 siblings (Paul Reinhold, Albert Anton, Maria Ann, Clare Antonie, Johanna Antonie and Carl Eduard). His father was a civil servant in the legal department of the Imperial administration. Bohrdt's love for the sea began when he was 15 after visiting the port of Hamburg. Bohrdt lived and worked in Berlin, Germany, in the Dahlem district. He married Anna Louise Cook in Berlin Rixdorf in 1898. Together they had three children who would later leave and live in separate places around the world, the oldest stayed in Hamburg and the son moved out to Buenos Aires. Two world wars not only resulted in the decimation of Bohrdt's family but in the number of his works as well. Many are still unaccounted for, including his best-known painting, \\"Der letzte Mann\\" (\\"The Last Man\\"; 1915), which has been lost since 1924. Innumerable reproductions, both cheap and more lavish, have been reproduced from this work and it has been widely employed for various political purposes. Career While many smaller nations could point to a tradition of marine painting stretching back over a period of several hundred years, Germany can only be said to have become seriously engaged in this genre after the country became united in 1871. Marine painting was a young form of art in Germany and came to be \\"the heartland\\" of the country. For the art schools of the inland cities of Karlsruhe, Dresden and Berlin, landscape painting provided the backbone of their curriculum. Nevertheless, the study of seascapes was included on their syllabus. Bohrdt was to a large extent an autodidact, but he had studied sporadically at the Academy of Fine Arts in Berlin. There, he soon tired of drawing from plaster copies of more or less classical subjects, finding this way of learning to be more of a hindrance than a help within his chosen field. Bohrdt became a bright star in that firmament of marine painters that shone so brightly during the Wilhelmine era. During the 1880s the younger Kaiser had purchased some of Bohrdt's paintings, both for his own private collection and for public buildings. Bohrdt became a painter √† la mode, and was praised by no less a person than Adolf Rosenberg, the leading critic of the day, which lead to Bohrdt forming a personal friendship with the Kaiser himself. He was showered with decorations and in 1898 was awarded an honorary doctorate. By 1904, his work had begun to assume a somewhat plodding predictability, and an art critic who had earlier been benevolently inclined towards Bohrdt now observed of one of his exhibitions that it \\"contained many paintings but little art\\". He often used tempera for his illustrations, as this medium is particularly suited for reproduction as a print, and he was able to hold his ground for a surprisingly long time against the remorseless advance of photography and the camera. During the decade prior to World War I, the German Merchant Marine had grown to a size only second to that of the United Kingdom. Not only the vessels themselves, proudly bearing three or four funnels, but even the cargoes and the passenger, were depicted in order to publicize the various shipping lines. Commissions were not long in coming. World War I Patrolling the sky for English flyers His art had by now become a part of the propaganda apparatus in a Germany resolved on becoming a world power, and in which the Navy was but one of the essential elements. To quote Pompey, and probably Herr Professor Hans Bohrdt, \\"Navigate necesse est, vivere non\\".(\\"to sail is necessary, to live is not\\") Apart from promoting the interests of the Navy and the major shipping lines, his work was established and appreciated amongst a wide circle of affluent buyers. As a member of the Imperial Yacht Club, he was able to exhibit his work, and to obtain work as an illustrator for various Yearbooks. Until the outbreak of the war, artists had been given the opportunity to accompany the Fleet on its worldwide cruises and when security restrictions no longer allowed this, Bohrdt felt that he had lost his connection with the sea. It was a very hard time for him. It was, he said, \\"like being a Red Indian in New York.\\" The outcome of the war resulted in the reduction of the merchant fleet, the confiscation of ships and consequently no more commissions. All that remained was for Bohrdt to be a painter of nostalgic picture postcards. During the 1920s, the recovery of the Merchant Marine ushered in new commissions for the artist, but he never really managed to be again in step with the spirit of the times. He died in a retirement home on 19 December 1945. Memorial exhibition In remembrance of the fiftieth anniversary of his death in 1945, the Museum arranged an exhibition of his work. In addition to those of Bohrdt's paintings, posters, prints and reproductions that it holds in its own collection, the Museum gathered a number of works from both public and private sources. The aim of the organizers was to provide a picture as possible of the last of the great marine painters. The technical virtuosity of this artist who so dearly loved ships and the sea is revealed in all its forms, and considerable attention is given to his skill as an illustrator. Institute of Prehistoric Archaeology The Institute of Prehistoric Archaeology is in villa, which was built in 1906, of Hans Bohrdt. As a historical discipline the subject of prehistoric archaeology is concerned with the study of artefacts and monuments and their cultural and historical significance. Following the canon of subjects relating to archaeology offered at Freie Universit√§t Berlin, the subject matter deals with archaeological remains that were discovered in Europe through excavations and surveys dated to the time span from the emergence of humankind to the medieval period. Particular emphasis is placed upon the study of the development of sedentism during the Neolithic period (c. 8000 B.C.) until the migration period.

It was directed by John Riggi, and written by Lauren Gurganous and Nina Pedrad. The episode originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network in the United States on April 5, 2012. In the episode, Jack (Alec Baldwin) encourages ambition in defeated employee Pete (Scott Adsit); Tracy's restored sense of smell causes him to treat Liz (Tina Fey) as a father figure; and Jenna (Jane Krakowski) has another prank war with the writers. Plot Kabletown's employee self-evaluations reveal that Pete (Scott Adsit) only hopes to maintain his current position. Jack (Alec Baldwin) considers his lack of ambition a personal failure and tries to boost his confidence. After a series of pathetic failures, Jack admits he is only stalling to avoid filling out his own self-evaluation, and Pete throws him out of his office for making his life even worse (and making him shave his ring of hair, revealing an obscene birthmark). When releasing his new fragrance, Tracy (Tracy Morgan) reveals he has had no sense of smell since childhood. Dr. Spaceman (Chris Parnell) removes a Buck Rodgers decoder ring stuck up his nose. Tracy's new sense of smell associates the pomade of Liz (Tina Fey) with the father that abandoned him and begins behaving like a model employee to impress her. Although she is thrilled with his behavior, Liz finds out he has abandoned his family in the process, and asks Dr. Spaceman to reverse the operation for Tracy's own good. After the writers pull yet another prank on her, Jenna (Jane Krakowski) gets revenge by finding embarrassing details in their trash. The writers get back at her by making her feel sorry for Lutz (John Lutz), whom she'd left out of her revenge. This also turns out to be a prank, and the writers submit video of her digging through a dumpster to a fetish website. When Jenna found out about this, she realizes that she has done a nice thing for Lutz by digging his trash all night, which causes her to realize that she is not the worst person she ever known, but rather the fourth worst since the three writers took advantage of her kindness. Cultural references When Jack laments that NBC's writers are all \\"so white\\", Liz exclaims that \\"Popo popped Dukie down by the vacants\\", a reference to HBO's The Wire, which is notable among shows with predominantly African American casts for gaining significant traction among white Americans.

The outcomes of battles between ancient navies have been studied by the military to learn tactics that would help in their conquests. The ships that these civilizations created were what many ship designs were based on and allowed the vessels to become better built. The Punic Wars are one of the most notorious wars in history and the vessels and tactics of all three wars are a major part of military history. Egyptian Navy Model of Ancient Egyptian ship. Drawing of Ancient Egyptian ship with a sail. Ships and boats were an important part of the ancient Egyptian's life. The earliest boats in Egypt were made during the time of the Old Kingdom where they were used along the Nile River. Because of the lack of wood, boats were made with bundled papyrus reeds. The boats were 25 meters long, two to three meters wide, and sixty centimeters deep which allowed seating for 30 rowers with one to two rudder oars. Hulls were sickle shaped and often had masts and deck houses. Over time the Egyptians tried to transport heavier loads and this brought about the desire for stronger boats. Trade and war also assisted in the desire to have stronger, sturdier vessels. The wooden vessels were similar to those made of reeds but the main difference was the eventual adoption of a single square mast that was fastened to the gunwale. After being reinforced, it was able to carry 300 ton loads up and down the Nile River. These vessels, despite being reinforced, were unable to be used in the Mediterranean or Red Seas. The use of ships in Egyptian Warfare is as old as conflict in Egypt itself but there was very little ability for sea travel to be achieved. When sea travel was obtained, the vessels and the wars they were in were depicted in red on pottery of that time period. Persian Navy The Achaemenid Empire, also known as the Persian Empire, had primarily a land based military but around 5th century BC, at the time of Cambyses II, the Empire started to develop a navy to allow for expansion. Their first ships were built by Phoenicians in their shipyards. These ships were 40 meters in length and 6 meters in width and able to carry 300 soldiers. Shortly after these ships were made, arsenals were made to make new ships as well as improve and repair the vessels. These ships were used to sail the Black Sea, the Aegean Sea, and coastal areas. The mariners of these vessels were Phoenicians, Greeks, Cypriots, and Egyptians. The Phoenicians however became the primary mariners of the vessels they made. These ships also had a metal blade in the front to cut enemy ships in half when ramming. They also had hooks which were used to catch and stop enemy ships. The Empire had three different major naval bases. The first was along the Shaat aI-Arab waterway. The second was to protect the eastern and southern parts of the Mediterranean Sea. The third was located in Cilicia and had a main goal of influencing the Greeks. These bases were kept on constant battle readiness in the case they had to project their power. Roman Navy Prior to the Punic Wars the Roman classis or fleet was limited to minor coastal operations and support for trade. The Romans concentrated on land based operations until this period in order to conquer and consolidate the Italian peninsula. The wars with Carthage forced the Romans to adapt to naval operations in order to compete and defend themselves. These fleet were built in several different places such as the coast of Italy and Southern Tuscany. =First Punic War= During the First Punic War a large fleet was built allegedly using a stranded Phoenician vessel as a prototype. The Romans lacked the skill of other maritime powers such as the Greeks and Carthaginians and had to resort to technology for advantages. The traditional naval tactic of ramming wasn't abandoned, but the Roman ships were fitted with a corvus to accommodate their strengths in land combat. This movable boarding bridge enabled the Romans to transform naval combat from ramming and sinking to boarding with marines through capturing and plundering the vessels. In its initial stages this new combat style enabled the Romans to win some overwhelming successes against the Carthaginian fleet, but the added weight of the corvus made their vessels less maneuverable and seaworthy resulting in heavy losses with violent weather conditions. A tactic that the Romans used were the use of fireships and combustibles. The combustibles were thrown on board the enemy ships to damage the ship and its personnel. left =Second Punic War= During the Second Punic War, Hannibal abandoned the once formidable Carthaginian fleet to focus on land operations. This was caused by a victory that bred confidence and led to the eventual invasion of North Africa. Their newly founded sea prowess enabled the Roman legions to land on the coast of North Africa and bring the war out of Italy and into the laps of the Carthaginians. =Post Punic War Roman Navy= With the final destruction of Carthage, and the end of the Third Punic War in 146 BC, Rome was the master of sea power in the Mediterranean. In both the Second and Third Punic Wars, Roman sea power was predominant, though not vigorously exercised. This caused restrictions for the Carthaginian communication forces and forced them to keep strong defensive garrisons in Spain and their home territory. However, the conquest of Carthage also eliminated the threat of maritime warfare as there was no longer any sea powers left to challenge Roman supremacy. As a result, the navy slipped into the logistical role of support to the legions and providing escort for trade vessels and grain shipments, with the adverse effect of drastically increasing piracy. =Imperial Roman Navy and Beyond= The imperial navy after Augustus, aside from the occasional conflicts in civil wars, once again was primarily charged with the protection of shipping and deterring piracy. Rome maintained two large fleets, the Classis Praetoria Misenensis and Classis Praetoria Ravennatis based in the Mediterranean with smaller squadrons operating on the North Sea, Black Sea and along the major rivers running throughout the provinces. Misenum, built by Agrippa in 31 BC, was the main naval base of the Mediterranean, joined by Ravenna, Aleria on Corsica and other temporary ports. The military situations on the Rhine and the Danube necessitated the construction of several dedicated fleet installations for the provincial fleets, classis Germanica, Pannonia and Moesica, but most were attached to the existing forts of Provincial Legions. In the English Channel and the North Sea (Oceanus Britannicus and Oceanus Germanicus), the Classis Britannica was stationed at Portus Itius (Boulogne) in Gaul and later also used the Saxon Shore forts of Britannia as bases. As Roman power waned in the 4th and 5th centuries AD, so went the Roman navy. In 429 AD, the Vandals embarked on ships from southern Gaul and landed in North Africa, where they established their own kingdom. Within a couple of decades, the Roman Empire consisted of little more than the city of Rome itself and its original territories in Latium and Central Italy. The Vandals' powerful navy contributed to the fall of the Western Empire when Vandal pirate King Gaiseric not only eliminated Roman shipping on the Mediterranean, but also invaded Rome itself. By the mid 5th century, the Vandals were the masters of the sea, and by 476 AD, Rome had fallen completely from power in Western Europe.

He subsequently entered into the ownership of Lady Beaverbrook and was sent into training with Major Dick Hern at West Ilsley in Berkshire. Lady Beaverbrook was considered an eccentric character who gave most of her horses names consisting of one word with seven letters (Bustino, Terimon, Boldboy, Niniski, Mystiko) as this was the most common form for Derby winners' names. Racing career =1984: two-year-old season= Petoski began his racing career in the six furlong Champagne Stakes at Salisbury and won by half a length from Tom Boat. In August he was sent to Goodwood for the Group Three Lanson Champagne Stakes and won by three quarters of a length from the British Horse of the Year Provideo. Petoski then started favourite for the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster but finished third to Young Runaway, having been unable to obtain a clear run at a crucial stage of the race. On his final start of the season, Petoski was made favourite for the Royal Lodge Stakes at Ascot in October, but finished unplaced. At the end of the year he was given a rating of 107 by Timeform who noted that he was likely to perform better at longer distances and seemed to be suited by firm ground. =1985: three-year-old season= In early 1985, Petoski was prepared for a run in The Derby by running in two recognised trial races. In May he finished second by a length to Damister in the Sandown Classic Trial, and two weeks later he ran second to Law Society in the Chester Vase. Following these performances he was sent off at odds of 33/1 in the Derby and finished eleventh of the thirteen runners behind Slip Anchor. Petoski appeared to be a useful racehorse who was unable to compete at the highest class. In July, Petoski appeared at Newmarket to contest the Group Two Princess of Wales's Stakes. Ridden as usual by Willie Carson he produced easily his best performance to date to win by two lengths from a field which included Jupiter Island (Japan Cup) and Lanfranco (King Edward VII Stakes). The way in which he \\"stormed home\\" in the race led some commentators to question the validity of the Epsom Derby form. Later in the same month, Petoski was sent to Ascot for the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in which he faced a field which included Oh So Sharp and Rainbow Quest from England, Law Society and Princess Pati from Ireland, Treizieme from France, Sirius Symboli from Japan and Strawberry Road from Australia. Petoski was held up towards the rear of the field before moving into contention in the straight. Switched to the outside, he produced a strong late run to take the lead in the final strides and win by a neck from Oh So Sharp with Rainbow Quest in third. The winning time was the fastest since Grundy's win in 1975 and remained the second fastest for the race until the victory of Harbinger in 2010. Following the race, Dick Hern, who had been confined to a wheelchair following a hunting accident when riding with the Quorn in December 1984, received a personal telephone message from the Queen congratulating him on Petoski's victory. Petoski was being prepared for a run in the Great Voltigeur Stakes in August when he sustained a pastern injury that ruled him out for the rest of the season. At the end of the year, Petoski was given a Timeform rating of 135. =1986: four-year-old season= Petoski stayed in training as a four-year-old but failed to win in three starts, finishing third in the Coronation Cup and the Princess of Wales's Stakes. He finished unplaced behind Dancing Brave in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes on his final appearance. Stud career Petoski was not a success as a stallion. He sired fewer than a hundred flat race winners, the best probably being the Preis der Diana winner Night Petticoat. He had slightly more success as a sire of jumpers and show horses, with one of his offspring, the Queen's horse Petition, winning a major prize at the Royal Windsor Horse Show. He stood for several years at the British National Stud and was later based at the Conduit Farm in Oxfordshire. His last foals were conceived in 2003.

When the ch√¢teau was built, Versailles was a country village; today, however, it is a suburb of Paris, some 20 kilometres southwest of the French capital. The court of Versailles was the centre of political power in France from 1682, when Louis XIV moved from Paris, until the royal family was forced to return to the capital in October 1789 after the beginning of the French Revolution. Versailles is therefore famous not only as a building, but as well as a symbol of the system of absolute monarchy of the Ancien R√©gime. Origins The earliest mention of the name of Versailles is found in a document which predates 1038, the Charte de l'abbaye Saint-P√®re de Chartres (Charter of the Saint-P√®re de Chartres Abbey),Gu√©rard 1840, p. 125. in which one of the signatories was a certain Hugo de Versailliis (Hugues de Versailles), who was seigneur of Versailles.Gu√©rard 1840, p. xiv. During this period, the village of Versailles centred on a small castle and church, and the area was governed by a local lord. Its location on the road from Paris to Dreux and Normandy brought some prosperity to the village but, following an outbreak of the Plague and the Hundred Years' War, the village was largely destroyed, and its population sharply declined.Bluche, 1990; Thompson, 2006; Verlet, 1985. In 1575, Albert de Gondi, a naturalized Florentine who gained prominence at the court of Henry II, purchased the seigneury of Versailles. Ancien R√©gime The ch√¢teau, ,Garrigues 2001, p. 37. as shown on the map of =Louis XIII= In the early seventeenth century, Gondi invited Louis XIII on several hunting trips in the forests surrounding Versailles. Pleased with the location, Louis ordered the construction of a hunting lodge in 1624. Designed by Philibert Le Roy, the structure, a small ch√¢teau, was constructed of stone and red brick, with a based roof. Eight years later, Louis obtained the seigneury of Versailles from the Gondi family and began to make enlargements to the ch√¢teau.Batiffol, 1913; Bluche, 1991; Marie, 1968; Nolhac, 1901; Verlet, 1985 A vignette of Versailles from the 1652 Paris map of shows a traditional design: an entrance court with a corps de logis on the far western end, flanked by secondary wings on the north and south sides, and closed off by an entrance screen. Adjacent exterior towers were located at the four corners, with the entire structure surrounded by a moat. This was preceded by two service wings, creating a forecourt with a grilled entrance marked by two round towers. The vignette also shows a garden on the western side of the ch√¢teau with a fountain on the central axis and rectangular planted parterres to either side.Hazlehurst 1980, p. 60. Louis XIV had played and hunted at the site as a boy.Versailles, The Dream of a King, directed by Paul Burgess, BBC TV With a few modifications, this structure would become the core of the new palace. =Louis XIV= Statue of Louis XIV in Versailles Louis XIII's successor, Louis XIV, had a great interest in Versailles. He settled on the royal hunting lodge at Versailles, and over the following decades had it expanded into one of the largest palaces in the world.F√©libien, 1703; Marie, 1972; Verlet, 1985. Beginning in 1661, the architect Louis Le Vau, landscape architect Andr√© Le N√¥tre, and painter-decorator Charles Lebrun began a detailed renovation and expansion of the ch√¢teau. This was done to fulfill Louis XIV's desire to establish a new centre for the royal court. Following the Treaties of Nijmegen in 1678, he began to gradually move the court to Versailles. The court was officially established there on 6 May 1682.Berger 2008, p. 27. By moving his court and government to Versailles, Louis XIV hoped to extract more control of the government from the nobility and to distance himself from the population of Paris. All the power of France emanated from this centre: there were government offices here, as well as the homes of thousands of courtiers, their retinues, and all the attendant functionaries of court.Solnon, 1987. By requiring that nobles of a certain rank and position spend time each year at Versailles, Louis prevented them from developing their own regional power at the expense of his own and kept them from countering his efforts to centralise the French government in an absolute monarchy.Bluche, 1986, 1991; Bendix, 1978; Solnon, 1987. The meticulous and strict court etiquette that Louis established, which overwhelmed his heirs with its petty boredom, was epitomised in the elaborate ceremonies and exacting procedures that accompanied his rising in the morning, known as the Lever, divided into a petit lever for the most important and a grand lever for the whole court. Like other French court manners, √©tiquette was quickly imitated in other European courts.Benichou, 1948; Bluche, 1991; Solnon 1987. According to historian Philip Mansel, the king turned the palace into: :an irresistible combination of marriage market, employment agency and entertainment capital of aristocratic Europe, boasting the best theater, opera, music, gambling, sex and (most important) hunting. Philip Mansel, . King of the World: The Life of Louis XIV (2020) cited in Tim Blanning, Solar Power The Wall Street Journal Oct 17-18, 2020, p. C9.. The expansion of the ch√¢teau became synonymous with the absolutism of Louis XIV.Bluche, 1986, 1991. In 1661, following the death of Cardinal Mazarin, chief minister of the government, Louis had declared that he would be his own chief minister. The idea of establishing the court at Versailles was conceived to ensure that all of his advisors and provincial rulers would be kept close to him. He feared that they would rise up against him and start a revolt and believed that if he kept all of his potential threats near him, they would be powerless. After the disgrace of Nicolas Fouquet in 1661 ‚Äì Louis claimed the finance minister would not have been able to build his grand ch√¢teau at Vaux-le-Vicomte without having embezzled from the crown ‚Äì Louis, after the confiscation of Fouquet's estate, employed the talents of Le Vau, Le N√¥tre, and Le Brun, who all had worked on Vaux-le- Vicomte, for his building campaigns at Versailles and elsewhere. For Versailles, there were four distinct building campaigns (after minor alterations and enlargements had been executed on the ch√¢teau and the gardens in 1662‚Äì1663), all of which corresponded to Louis XIV's wars.Bluche, 1986, 1991; Verlet, 1985. First building campaign The ch√¢teau circa 1668, as painted by Pierre Patel (Versailles Museum) The first building campaign (1664‚Äì1668) commenced with the Plaisirs de l‚Äô√éle enchant√©e of 1664, a f√™te that was held between 7 and 13 May 1664. The f√™te was ostensibly given to celebrate the two queens of France ‚Äì Anne of Austria, the Queen Mother, and Marie-Th√©r√®se, Louis XIV's wife ‚Äì but in reality honored the king's mistress, Louise de La Valli√®re. The celebration of the Plaisirs de l‚Äô√éle enchant√©e is often regarded as a prelude to the War of Devolution, which Louis waged against Spain. The first building campaign (1664‚Äì1668) involved alterations in the ch√¢teau and gardens to accommodate the 600 guests invited to the party.Nolhac, 1899, 1901; Marie, 1968; Verlet, 1985. Second building campaign Plan of the main floor (c. 1676), showing Le Vau's enveloppe with the 1985, p. 74 (fig. 7). The second building campaign (1669‚Äì1672) was inaugurated with the signing of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, which ended the War of Devolution. During this campaign, the ch√¢teau began to assume some of the appearance that it has today. The most important modification of the ch√¢teau was Le Vau's envelope of Louis XIII's hunting lodge. The enveloppe ‚Äì often referred to as the ch√¢teau neuf to distinguish it from the older structure of Louis XIII ‚Äì enclosed the hunting lodge on the north, west, and south. For a time between late 1668 and early 1669, when the ground floor of the enveloppe was being constructed, Louis XIV intended to completely demolish his father's palace and replace it with a monumental forecourt. Le Vau's design imagined a large extension of the enveloppe westwards, enabling huge galleries and staircases to be built. In June 1669 Louis XIV decided to keep his father's hunting lodge, so the architectural plans for the enveloppe had to be reconfigured and the scale of the new rooms reduced.Walton, 1986; p. 67-69 The new structure provided new lodgings for the king and members of his family. The main floor ‚Äì the piano nobile ‚Äì of the ch√¢teau neuf was given over entirely to two apartments: one for the king, and one for the queen. The grand appartement du roi occupied the northern part of the ch√¢teau neuf and grand appartement de la reine occupied the southern part. View of the garden front, 1674, after the second building capmpaign, engraving by Isra√´l Silvestre Garden fa√ßade of the Palace of Versailles, ca. 1675, with the terrace that later became the Hall of Mirrors The western part of the enveloppe was given over almost entirely to a terrace, which was later enclosed with the construction of the Hall of Mirrors (Galerie des Glaces). The ground floor of the northern part of the ch√¢teau neuf was occupied by the appartement des bains, which included a sunken octagonal tub with hot and cold running water. The king's brother and sister-in-law, the duke and duchesse d‚ÄôOrl√©ans occupied apartments on the ground floor of the southern part of the ch√¢teau neuf. The upper story of the ch√¢teau neuf was reserved for private rooms for the king to the north and rooms for the king's children above the queen's apartment to the south.Nolhac, 1901; Marie, 1972; Verlet, 1985. Significant to the design and construction of the grands appartements is that the rooms of both apartments are of the same configuration and dimensions ‚Äì a hitherto unprecedented feature in French palace design. It has been suggested that this parallel configuration was intentional as Louis XIV had intended to establish Marie- Th√©r√®se d‚ÄôAutriche as queen of Spain, and thus thereby establish a dual monarchy.Johnson, 1981. Louis XIV's rationale for the joining of the two kingdoms was seen largely as recompense for Philip IV's failure to pay his daughter Marie-Th√©r√®se's dowry, which was among the terms of capitulation to which Spain agreed with the promulgation of the Treaty of the Pyrenees, which ended the war between France and Spain that began in 1635 during the Thirty Years‚Äô War. Louis XIV regarded his father-in-law's act as a breach of the treaty and consequently engaged in the War of Devolution. Both the grand appartement du roi and the grand appartement de la reine formed a suite of seven enfilade rooms. Each room is dedicated to one of the then known celestial bodies and is personified by the appropriate Greco-Roman deity. The decoration of the rooms, which was conducted under Le Brun's direction depicted the ‚Äúheroic actions of the king‚Äù and were represented in allegorical form by the actions of historical figures from the antique past (Alexander the Great, Augustus, Cyrus, etc.).Berger, 1985b, pp. 41‚Äì50 (Chapter 5: \\"The Planetary Rooms\\"); F√©libien, 1674; Verlet, 1985. Third building campaign With the signing of the Treaty of Nijmegen in 1678, which ended the Dutch War, the third building campaign at Versailles began (1678‚Äì1684). The court had grown during the 1670s as Louis XIV re-shaped his relationship with the high aristocracy. To enjoy his favor it became indispensable to attend Louis wherever he went, placing a strain on the existing accommodation for courtiers at Versailles. The royal family had also grown sizeably, augmented by the legitimization of Louis' five children by his mistress Madame de Montespan between 1673 and 1681.Walton, 1986; p.92-93 As newly-forged Princes of the Blood all of these children required suitable apartments at Versailles. The South Wing of the ch√¢teau, overlooking the gardens. Construction commenced in 1679. Under the direction of the chief architect, Jules Hardouin-Mansart, the Palace of Versailles acquired much of the look that it has today during the 1680s. Le Brun was occupied not only with the interior decoration of the new additions of the palace, but also collaborated with Le N√¥tre's in landscaping the palace gardens.Berger, 1985a; Thompson, 2006; Verlet, 1985. As symbol of France's new prominence as a European super- power, Louis XIV officially installed his court at Versailles in May 1682. Hardouin Mansart designed two new monumental wings to address Versaille's accommodation problems: the South Wing, known as the Aile des Princes because it housed the Princes of the Blood, was the first to be built in 1679. The South Wing is 176 yards long (528 feet), and was built with three interior courtyards capable of housing servants and aristocrats in addition to the Princes of the Blood, who were given luxurious apartments behind the west fa√ßade overlooking the gardens.Spawforth, 2008; p.47 In 1684 construction commenced on the North Wing, which would house members of the high aristocracy; between the two new wings 175 new lodgings were created.Spawforth, 2008; p.11,47 Both wings replicated the Italianate fa√ßade of Le Vau's enveloppe on their western sides, creating a uniform and symmetrical appearance on the garden front.Walton, 1986; p.130 Major outbuildings of considerable grandeur in themselves were also built during the third phase, including the Grand Commun, the Orangerie, the Grand Trianon, and the pair of stables known as the Petit and Grand Ecurie. The Orangerie required excavating the hillside descending south from the palace, which allowed the construction of a 500 foot long arcaded gallery with shorter wings extending at right angles, buttressed against the hill above. This cost roughly 1.1 million livres between 1684 and 1685, with construction completed in 1686.Walton, 1986; p.138-139 Mansart's imposing Grand Commun was built on the site of the old village church of Versailles, St. Julien, east of the new South Wing of the Chateau, between 1682 and 1684. An enormous rectangle arranged around a central courtyard, the Grand Commun was a dormitory for members of the King's household, intended to provide 103 new lodgings.Spawforth, 2008; p. 47 Mansart's Grand Commons, built between 1682-84 to house members of the King's household The largest and most imposing outbuildings were the two stables, the Grand and the Petit Ecurie, constructed between 1679 and 1682. The Royal Stables were given pride of place opposite the Cour d'Armes in front of the main palace, on either side of the Avenue de Paris, the main approach to Versailles from Paris. Far from being simply utilitarian, Hardouin-Mansart designed two Neoclassical buildings of equal size and grandeur, capable of housing thousands of horses and the nearly 1,500 men employed in the household department of the Royal Stables. The \\"Grand\\" Stable housed the King's hunting horses and hounds, while the \\"Petit\\" Stable contained the King's carriages and other transport.Walton, 1986; The third phase saw the re-configuration of major parts of the Grand Apartments of both the King and the Queen. Louis XIV ceased to inhabit the rooms of his Grand Apartment, the salons of which were instead used for purposes of state and ceremony. Between the new Hall of Mirrors to the west and the Staircase of the Ambassadors to the east, the Grand Apartment created one huge route for entertainment and palace f√™tes.Walton, 1986; p.107 The King's former bedchamber became a throne room known as the Salon d'Apollon, while the neighboring Salon de Mercure contained a state bed partitioned from the public area by a solid silver balustrade. The Grand Apartments were furnished sumptuously with objects from the Gobelins Manufactory, showcasing the very best in French decorative arts and craftmanship. The most extravagant ornaments were those made from solid silver at the Gobelins, to the cost of some 10 million livres. There were 167 such objects on display between the Hall of Mirrors and the Grand Apartment in 1687, ranging from candelabras, gueridons and statues, to urns, stools, and incense burners.Walton, 1986; p.125 For the new appartement du roi, Louis chose the set of eight rooms on the piano nobile behind the west fa√ßade of the Cour de Marbre which had once belonged to his father in the old chateau. To create a suitably sumptuous approach, the rooms behind the south fa√ßade overlooking the Cour de Marbre were modified to create three large antechambers (the vestibule, Salle des gardes du roi, and the Premi√®re Antichambre) preceding the King's bedchamber, followed by the Grand Salon at the center of the west fa√ßade.Walton, 1986; p.107 The Queen continued to inhabit her own Grand Apartment, albeit with some modifications. In 1680 the Salon of Mars which had served as the Queen's guard-room was converted into a dining room for the Grand Couvert, a daily ritual in which the King and Queen ate their midday meal together in view of the court.Walton, 1986; p.108-109 Another antechamber just east of the new dining room was then converted into a replacement guard room. After the death of the Queen in 1684, one of the rooms from her Grand Apartment, between the south and west facades, was transformed into the Deuxi√®me Antichambre of the Appartement du roi.Verlet, 211 Fourth building campaign View from the Place d'Armes, ca. 1722, by Pierre-Denis Martin (1663-1742) Soon after the crushing defeat of the War of the League of Augsburg (1688‚Äì1697) and owing possibly to the pious influence of Madame de Maintenon, Louis XIV undertook his last building campaign at Versailles. The fourth building campaign (1699‚Äì1710) concentrated almost exclusively on construction of the royal chapel designed by Hardouin-Mansart and finished by Robert de Cotte and his team of decorative designers. In 1701 there were further modifications in the appartement du roi, namely the construction of the Salon de l‚Äô≈íil de B≈ìuf and the King's Bedchamber. This was achieved by eliminating the wall between the Deuxi√®me Antichambre and the old bedchamber of the King, creating one much larger antechamber in the process, the Chambre de l'Oeil de Boeuf. The neighboring Grand Salon was then converted into the new bedchamber of the king, which now sat squarely at the center of the west fa√ßade over the Cour de Marbre.Walton, 1986; p.190-194 With the completion of the chapel in 1710, virtually all construction at Versailles ceased; building would not be resumed at Versailles until some twenty one years later during the reign of Louis XV.Nolhac 1911; Marie 1976, 1984; Verlet, 1985. { border=\\"0\\" style=\\"background:white; color:black; height:230px; margin:auto; vertical- align:bottom;\\" cellpadding=\\"10px\\" cellspacing=\\"0px\\" +style=\\"background:white; color:black\\"Plans of the evolution of Versailles'' - style=\\"text- align:center;\\" 250x150px 250x150px 250x150px - style=\\"text-align:center; vertical-align:top;\\"  style=\\"width:200px;\\"The palace in 1668  style=\\"width:200px;\\"The palace in 1674  style=\\"width:200px;\\"The palace in 1680 } =Louis XV= After the death of the Louis XIV in 1715, the five- year-old king Louis XV, the court, and the R√©gence government of Philippe d‚ÄôOrl√©ans returned to Paris. In May 1717, during his visit to France, the Russian czar Peter the Great stayed at the Grand Trianon. His time at Versailles was used to observe and study the palace and gardens, which he later used as a source of inspiration when he built Peterhof on the Bay of Finland, west of Saint Petersburg.Verlet 1985, p. 301. During the reign of Louis XV, Versailles underwent transformation but not on the scale that had been seen during his predecessor's reign. When Louis XV and the court returned to Versailles in 1722, the first project was the completion of the Salon d'Hercule, which had been begun during the last years of Louis XIV's reign but was never finished due to the king's death.Verlet 1985, pp. 321‚Äì324. Significant among Louis XV's contributions to Versailles were the petit appartement du roi; the appartements des Mesdames, the appartement du dauphin, the appartement de la dauphine on the ground floor; and the two private apartments of Louis XV ‚Äì petit appartement du roi au deuxi√®me √©tage (later transformed into the appartement de Madame du Barry) and the petit appartement du roi au troisi√®me √©tage ‚Äì on the second and third floors of the palace. The crowning achievements of Louis XV's reign were the construction of the Op√©ra and the Petit Trianon.Verlet, 198, pp. 375‚Äì384 (Op√©ra) and 500‚Äì505 (Petit Trianon). Equally significant was the destruction of the Escalier des Ambassadeurs (Ambassadors' Stair), the only fitting approach to the State Apartments, which Louis XV undertook to make way for apartments for his daughters.Verlet 1985, pp. 307‚Äì308. The case for removing the Escalier was strengthened by the poor condition of the cast bronze support for the massive skylight over the staircase, which under Louis XIV had been an experimental wonder which allowed for an unprecedented span of the glass. By the 1750s this structure had seriously weakened, necessitating the removal of the skylight and the destruction of the staircase.Walton 1986, pp. 161-162 The gardens remained largely unchanged from the time of Louis XIV; the completion of the Bassin de Neptune between 1738 and 1741 was the most important legacy Louis XV made to the gardens.Marie 1984; Thompson, 2006; Verlet 1985, pp. 329‚Äì330. Towards the end of his reign, Louis XV, under the advice of Ange-Jacques Gabriel, began to remodel the courtyard fa√ßades of the palace. With the objective revetting the entrance of the palace with classical fa√ßades, Louis XV began a project that was continued during the reign of Louis XVI, but which did not see completion until the 20th century.Ayers 2004, pp. 340‚Äì341.. Gardens and palace of Versailles in 1746, by the abbot Delagrive =Louis XVI= In 1774, shortly after his ascension, Louis XVI ordered an extensive replanting of the bosquets of the gardens, since many of the century-old trees had died. Only a few changes to Le N√¥tre's design were made: some bosquets were removed, others altered, including the Bains d'Apollon (north of the Parterre de Latone), which was redone after a design by Hubert Robert in anglo-chinois style (popular during the late 18th century), and the Labyrinthe (at the southern edge of the garden) was converted to the small Jardin de la Reine.Hoog 1996, p. 372; Verlet 1985, pp. 540‚Äì545. The worsening finances of the French monarchy led to neglect in the maintenance of the Palace. Benjamin Franklin described an air of \\"magnificence and negligence\\" when he visited, while royal architects warned of the dangerous condition of outbuildings like the Petit and Grand Ecurie (stables), where rotting timber in 1770 necessitated urgent rebuilding work.Spawforth 2008, . The Cabinet dor√©, one of several rooms in the petit appartement of Marie Antoinette redecorated by Richard Mique in the Louis XVI style. To compound the shortage of money, Louis XVI channeled significant financial resources into other properties, including the purchase and renovation of the Chateau de Saint Cloud in 1784, and an ongoing rebuilding of the Ch√¢teau de Compi√®gne throughout the 1780s.Spawforth 2008, . This left scant resources available to devote towards the long- nurtured dream of rebuilding the Paris-facing wings of the Enveloppe enclosing the Marble and Royal Courts, known as the \\"Grand Project\\". In 1780 Louis XVI completed the Gabriel Wing reconstruction begun by his grandfather, and he had plans to extend the rebuilding. In 1779, the Royal Buildings Office invited architects to submit designs for the \\"Grand Project\\", the goal being to harmonize the new Neoclassical Gabriel wing with the antiquated Louis XIII style of the southern wing and the original hunting lodge fa√ßade on the Marble Court. Ultimately, the advent of the debt crisis in the French government in 1787 and the beginning of the French Revolution spelled an end to any such plans. In the interior of the palace, the library and the salon des jeux in the petit appartement du roi and the petit appartement de la reine, redecorated by Richard Mique for Marie-Antoinette, are among the finest examples of the style Louis XVI.Verlet, 1945; Verlet 1985; Ayers 2004, p. 341. Several stories for the petit appartement du roi were added above those already constructed by Louis XV, reaching six stories high. Louis XVI was known to walk on the roof and enjoy the commanding views, sometimes sitting with a telescope to peer at the courtiers milling around in the forecourts beneath him. These additional floors, which loomed awkwardly above the Cour de Marbre and the main roofline of the palace, were intended to be temporary pending the long-awaited Grand Project. They were demolished in the 19th century in order to restore the appearance of the fa√ßade as it existed under Louis XIV.Spawforth 2008, p 175 French Revolution On 6 October 1789, the royal family had to leave Versailles and move to the Tuileries Palace in Paris, as a result of the Women's March on Versailles.Nagel 2009. During the early years of the French Revolution, preservation of the palace was largely in the hands of the citizens of Versailles. In October 1790, Louis XVI ordered the palace to be emptied of its furniture, requesting that most be sent to the Tuileries Palace. In response to the order, the mayor of Versailles and the municipal council met to draft a letter to Louis XVI in which they stated that if the furniture was removed, it would certainly precipitate economic ruin on the city.Gatin 1908. With the withdrawal of the king and the court from Versailles, many of those who had been employed either through a member of the royal family or by the court, followed the court and king to Paris. As a result, the population of Versailles fell from 80,000 to less than 25,000 in the weeks that followed 6 October 1789 (Mauguin, 1934). A deputation from Versailles met with the king on 12 October after which Louis XVI, touched by the sentiments of the residents of Versailles, rescinded the order. Eight months later, however, the fate of Versailles was sealed: on 21 June 1791, Louis XVI was arrested at Varennes after which the Assembl√©e nationale constituante accordingly declared that all possessions of the royal family had been abandoned. To safeguard the palace, the Assembl√©e nationale constituante ordered the palace of Versailles to be sealed. On 20 October 1792 a letter was read before the National Convention in which Jean-Marie Roland de la Plati√®re, interior minister, proposed that the furnishings of the palace and those of the residences in Versailles that had been abandoned be sold and that the palace be either sold or rented. The sale of furniture transpired at auctions held between 23 August 1793 and 30 niv√¥se an III (19 January 1795). Only items of particular artistic or intellectual merit were exempt from the sale. These items were consigned to be part of the collection of a museum, which had been planned at the time of the sale of the palace furnishings. In 1793, Charles- Fran√ßois Delacroix deputy to the Convention and father of the painter Eug√®ne Delacroix proposed that the metal statuary in the gardens of Versailles be confiscated and sent to the foundry to be made into cannon.Gatin 1908, p. ?. The proposal was debated but eventually it was tabled. On 28 flor√©al an II (5 May 1794) the Convention decreed that the ch√¢teau and gardens of Versailles, as well as other former royal residences in the environs, would not be sold but placed under the care of the Republic for the public good.Fromageot 1903, p. ?. Following this decree, the ch√¢teau became a repository for art work seized from churches and princely homes. As a result of Versailles serving as a repository for confiscated art works, collections were amassed that eventually became part of the proposed museum.Fromageot 1903, p. ??. Among the items found at Versailles at this time a collection of natural curiosities that has been assembled by the sieur Fayolle during his voyages in America. The collection was sold to the comte d‚ÄôArtois and was later confiscated by the state. Fayolle, who had been nominated to the Commission des arts, became guardian of the collection and was later, in June 1794, nominated by the Convention to be the first directeur du Conservatoire du Mus√©um national de Versailles.Fromageot 1903, p. ???. The next year, Andr√© Dumont the people's representative, became administrator for the department of the Seine-et-Oise. Upon assuming his administrative duties, Dumont was struck with the deplorable state into which the palace and gardens had sunk. He quickly assumed administrative duties of the ch√¢teau and assembled a team of conservators to oversee the various collections of the museum.Fromageot 1903, p. ????. One of Dumont's first appointments was that of Huges Lagarde (10 messidor an III (28 June 1795), a wealthy soap merchant from Marseille with strong political connections, as bibliographer of the museum. With the abandonment of the palace, there remained no less than 104 libraries which contained in excess of 200,000 printed volumes and manuscripts. Lagarde, with his political connections and his association with Dumont, became the driving force behind Versailles as a museum at this time. Lagarde was able to assemble a team of curators including sieur Fayolle for natural history and, Louis Jean-Jacques Durameau, the painter responsible for the ceiling painting in the Op√©ra, was appointed as curator for painting.Fromageot 1903, p. ?????. Owing largely to political vicissitudes that occurred in France during the 1790s, Versailles succumbed to further degradations. Mirrors were assigned by the finance ministry for payment of debts of the Republic and draperies, upholstery, and fringes were confiscated and sent to the mint to recoup the gold and silver used in their manufacture. Despite its designation as a museum, Versailles served as an annex to the H√¥tel des Invalides pursuant to the decree of 7 frimaire an VIII (28 November 1799), which commandeered part of the palace and which had wounded soldiers being housed in the petit appartement du roi.Gatin 1908, p. ??. In 1797, the Mus√©um national was reorganised and renamed Mus√©e sp√©cial de l‚Äô√âcole fran√ßaise.Dutilleux 1887, p. ?. The grands appartements were used as galleries in which the morceaux de r√©ception submitted by artists seeking admission to the Acad√©mie royale de peinture et de sculpture during the 17th and 18th centuries, the series The Life of Saint Bruno by Eustache Le Sueur and the Life of Marie de M√©dicis by Peter Paul Rubens were placed on display. The museum, which included the sculptures in the garden, became the finest museum of classic French art that had existed.Verlet 1985, pp. 661‚Äì664. First Empire With the advent of Napol√©on and the First Empire, the status of Versailles changed. Paintings and art work that had previously been assigned to Mus√©um national and the Mus√©e sp√©cial de l‚Äô√âcole fran√ßaise were systematically dispersed to other locations, and eventually the museum was closed. In accordance with provisions of the 1804 Constitution, Versailles was designated as an imperial palace for the department of the Seine-et- Oise.Article 16 : L'Empereur visite les d√©partements : en cons√©quence, des palais imp√©riaux sont √©tablis aux quatre points principaux de l'Empire. ‚Äì Ces palais sont d√©sign√©s et leurs d√©pendances d√©termin√©es par une loi. Source: Constitution of 1804 While Napol√©on did not reside in the ch√¢teau, apartments were, however, arranged and decorated for the use of the empress Marie-Louise. The emperor chose to reside at the Grand Trianon. The ch√¢teau continued to serve, however, as an annex of the H√¥tel des InvalidesMauguin, 1940‚Äì1942; Pradel, 1937; Verlet, 1985. Nevertheless, on 3 January 1805, Pope Pius VII, who came to France to officiate at Napol√©on's coronation, visited the palace and blessed the throng of people gathered on the parterre d'eau from the balcony of the Hall of Mirrors.Mauguin, 1940‚Äì1942. Bourbon Restoration The Bourbon Restoration saw little activity at Versailles. Areas of the gardens were replanted but no significant restoration and modifications of the interiors were undertaken, despite the fact that Louis XVIII would often visit the palace and walk through the vacant rooms.Mansel 1999; Thompson 2006. Charles X chose the Tuileries Palace over Versailles and rarely visited his former home.Castelot 1989. July Monarchy Louis-Philippe opening the Galerie des Batailles, 10 June 1837 (painted by Fran√ßois-Joseph Heim) With the Revolution of 1830 and the establishment of the July Monarchy, the status of Versailles changed. In March 1832, the Loi de la Liste civile was promulgated, which designated Versailles as a crown dependency. Like Napol√©on before him, Louis-Philippe chose to live at the Grand Trianon; however, unlike Napol√©on, Louis-Philippe did have a grand design for Versailles. In 1833, Louis-Philippe proposed the establishment of a museum dedicated to ‚Äúall the glories of France,‚Äù which included the Orl√©ans dynasty and the Revolution of 1830 that put Louis-Philippe on the throne of France. For the next decade, under the direction of Fr√©d√©ric Nepveu and Pierre-Fran√ßois-L√©onard Fontaine, the ch√¢teau underwent irreversible alterations.Constans 1985; Constans 1998, pp. 246‚Äì258; Mauguin, 1937; Verlet, 1985, pp. 661‚Äì664. The museum was officially inaugurated on 10 June 1837 as part of the festivities that surrounded the marriage of the Prince royal, Ferdinand-Philippe d‚ÄôOrl√©ans with princess H√©l√®ne of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and represented one of the most ambitious and costly undertakings of Louis-Philippe's reign. Over, the emperor at the king's home ‚Äì Napol√©on at Louis XIV's; in a word, it is having given to this magnificent book that is called French history this magnificent binding that is called Versailles (Victor Hugo).Hugo 1972. ‚ÄúCe que le roi Louis-Philippe a fait √† Versailles est bien. Avoir accompli cette ≈ìuvre, c'est avoir √©t√© grand comme roi et impartial comme philosophe ; c'est avoir fait un monument national d'un monument monarchique ; c'est avoir mis une id√©e immense dans un immense √©difice ; c'est avoir install√© le pr√©sent dans le pass√©, 1789 vis-√†- vis de 1688, l'empereur chez le roi, Napol√©on chez Louis XIV ; en un mot, c'est avoir donn√© √† ce livre magnifique qu'on appelle l'histoire de France cette magnifique reliure qu'on appelle Versailles.‚Äù Later, Balzac characterised the effort in less laudatory terms as the ‚Äúhospital of the glories of France‚Äù.Balzac 1853. The southern wing (Aile du Midi) was given over to the Galerie des Batailles (Hall of Battles), which necessitated the demolition of most of the apartments of the Princes of the Blood who lived in this part of the palace during the Ancien R√©gime. The Galerie des Batailles was modeled on the Grande Galerie of the Louvre Palace and was intended to glorify French military history from the Battle of Tolbiac (traditionally dated 495) to the Battle of Wagram (5‚Äì6 July 1809). While a number of the paintings were of questionable quality, a few were masterpieces, such as the Battle of Taillebourg by Eug√®ne Delacroix. Part of the northern wing (Aile du Nord) was converted to the Salle des Croisades, a room dedicated to famous knights of the Crusades and decorated with their names and coats of arms. The apartments of the dauphin and the dauphine as well as those of Louis XV‚Äôs daughters on the ground floor of the corps de logis were transformed into portrait galleries. To accommodate the displays, some of the boiseries were removed and either put into storage or sold. During the Prussian occupation of the palace in 1871, the boiseries in storage were burned as firewood.Constans, 1985; 1987; Mauguin, 1937; Verlet,1985. Second Empire During the Second Empire, the museum remained essentially intact. The palace did serve as the backdrop for a number of state events including the visit by Queen Victoria. Versailles under Pierre de Nolhac Pierre de Nolhac arrived at the Palace of Versailles in 1887 and was appointed curator of the museum 18 November 1892.Da Vinha & Masson 2011, p. 261. Upon his arrival, he planned to re- introduce historical galleries, organized scientifically, in contrast to the approach of Louis-Philippe, who had created the first galleries in a manner aimed at glorifying the history of France. At the same time, Nolhac began to restore the palace to its appearance before the Revolution. To achieve these two goals, Nolhac removed rooms, took down the artworks and gave the rooms some historical scenery. He explained in his memoirs, for example that \\"the first room sacrificed was that of the kings of France which had walls lined with effigies, real and imaginary, of our kings since Clovis\\".Da Vinha & Masson 2011, p. 229. The revolution wrought by Nolhac produced a new awareness of the castle. Members of high society and nobility, such as the Duke of Aumale and the Empress Eugenie flocked to see new developments. Nolhac also working to bring in foreign personalities. On 8 October 1896, Czar Nicolas II and his wife Alexandra, arrived at Versailles. Nolhac also organized events aimed at raising the awareness of potential donors to the palace. The owner of the New York Herald, Gordon Bennett, gave 25,000 francs for restructuring the 18th-century rooms. The development of private donations led to the creation of the Friends of Versailles in June 1907. Interwar period Pierre de Nolhac resigned his long held position as Curator of Versailles in 1920; his colleague Andr√© P√©rat√© assumed the head role and oversaw the palace for the next 13 years. By the early 1920s, years of accumulating neglect had taken a serious toll on the physical condition of the palace and gardens. Given the perilous financial state of the postwar French Third Republic, outside patronage became more essential than ever. In 1924, the American oil millionaire John D. Rockefeller was galvanized by a series of articles decrying the miserable state of repair at Versailles in the French magazine L'Illustration; Rockefeller wrote personally to the President of France, Raymond Poincar√©, to offer financial support in restoring the palace. Between 1925 and 1928, the Rockefeller Foundation donated $2,166,000 towards the restoration of Versailles (roughly $30 million in 2014 USD). The money supported the replacement of the roof of the palace, repairs to the masonry and to the exterior woodwork, the restoration of the Orangerie, the Th√©√¢tre de la Reine, and the Minister's Wings.Spawforth, 2008; p. 250 The Van der Kemp period Under the aegis of , chief conservator of the museum from 1952 to 1980, the palace witnessed some of its most ambitious conservation and restoration projects: the Op√©ra (completed in 1957); the Grand Trianon (1965); the Chambre de la Reine (1975); the Chambre de Louis XIV and the Hall of Mirrors (1980).P√©rouse de Montclos 1991, pp. 10, 284; Lemoine 1976. At this time, the ground floor of the northern wing was converted into a gallery of French history from the 17th century to the 19th century. Additionally, at this time, policy was established in which the French government would aggressively seek to acquire as much of original furniture and artwork that had been dispersed at the time of the Revolution of 1789 as possible.Kemp 1976; Meyer 1985. Contemporary Versailles With the past and ongoing restoration and conservation projects at Versailles, the Fifth Republic has enthusiastically promoted the museum as one of France's foremost tourist attractions.Opperman 2004. The palace, however, still serves political functions. Heads of state are regaled in the Hall of Mirrors; the S√©nat and the Assembl√©e Nationale meet in congress in Versailles to revise or otherwise amend the French Constitution, a tradition that came into effect with the promulgation of the 1875 Constitution.Article 9: Le si√®ge du pouvoir ex√©cutif et des deux chambres est √† Versailles.

Ch√¢teau de Versailles Spectacles organised the Jeff Koons Versailles exhibition, held from 9 October 2008 to 4 January 2009. Jeff Koons said that \\"I hope the juxtaposition of today's surfaces, represented by my work, with the architecture and fine arts of Versailles will be an exciting interaction for the viewer.\\"Jeff Koons Versailles website Elena Geuna and Laurent Le Bon, curators of the exhibition present it as follow: \\"It is the city aspect that underlies this entire venture. In recent years, many a cultural institution has attempted a confrontation between a heritage setting and contemporary works. The originality of this exhibition seems to us somewhat different, as regards both the chosen venue and the way it has been laid out. Echo, dialectic, opposition, counterpoint... Not for us to judge!\\" The bronze equestrian statue of Louis XIV (Statue √©questre de Louis XIV), a sculpture created by both Pierre Cartellier (1757-1831) and Louis Petitot (1794-1862) and completed in 1836, was restored in 2009. On April 27, 2009, the statue, having previously been situated in the courtyard (Cour d'Honneur), was placed outside the gates on the Place d‚ÄôArmes (intersection of Avenue Rockefeller and Avenue de Paris).The Art Tribune.

The SFMX is a nonprofit membership organization established in 1849 and is the second oldest corporation in California. Captain Korwatch began her maritime career by attending the California Maritime Academy in 1973, as a member of the schools first class of women. In 1988, she was the first woman to command a United States commercial vessel, the SS Maui. As General Manager of Marine Operations at Matson Navigation Company, she had many responsibilities; including managing the operation of fourteen ships owned or operated by Matson. She also served in temporary assignments as terminal manager at Matson's Oakland container yard. One achievement of which she very proud of was helping to create the \\"Vessel Zero Garbage Discharge Program\\". This was developed to eliminate vessel overboard waste that contained any solid materials and help insure that the waters between the West Coast and Hawaii remain as pristine as possible. This is seen as monumental as it was the first of its kind and exceeded all government regulations.  History of Marine Exchange  The Marine Exchange was founded as an agency which would announce the arrival of ships to ports in San Francisco. The reason for the upbringing of the company was because of the Gold Rush which began in 1849 and brought a lot of foreign ships to the city. A second reason for the creation of a Maritime Exchange was because San Francisco was surrounded by hills and headlands which isolated it from the ocean. It was important for people to know when the ships were arriving because these ships brought along with them news, mail, and commercial shipments from the East Coast. = Telegraph Hill = To accomplish these goals, the Maritime Exchange brought about a signal station which was located on top of Telegraph Hill. George F. Sweeney and Theodore F. Baugh were the two individuals to present the idea of a wooden semaphore on top of Telegraph Hill. A semaphore is a system in which one uses two flags or poles and sends signals in an alphabetic code. Sweeney and Baugh expanded their system by placing a signal station on Point Lobos, which is located 20‚Äì30 miles from port in San Francisco. The reasoning behind this was that there was high demand from people wanting to know when the ships were arriving at an earlier time so that they could be prepared for the shipments of the goods. = Marine Exchange today = Changes occur daily inside of the Marine Exchange. Recent history shows this in detail from the response to the needs of the Golden Gate Bridge to the overall well-being of this region. People involved in these daily changes, such as Lynn Korwatch, are seen as effective and adaptable. In the mix with the tradition of the past 169 years, these talented people help bring a fast paced new \\"shipping revolution\\" to today's world. The innovation and reliability of information is typically represented by the recent upgrade to all automation of message, information, internal accounting, word processing, and record keeping. The ever so helpful computerized systems that they now use is bringing more efficiency and sophistication than any other port in the United States. This is seen as a prime model to other non-profit organizations that are sponsored everywhere else in the country.  Personal life  Korwatch is the Chair of the SF Harbor Safety Committee. She is also involved in the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission, Seaport Advisory Committee and the Northern California Area Security Committee (AMSC). She has also served on the U.S. Coast Guard Navigation Safety Advisory Committee, the US Coast Guard Merchant Personnel Advisory Committee and currently serves on the Maritime Administration Marine Transportation System National Advisory Committee. She has received awards from the Navy League, Propeller Club, the California Maritime Academy and others. She was also an answer on the game show Jeopardy!

The residence was one of the few formal solares or estate homes located on the island of Faial, that was abandoned, and later destroyed in a fire during the 20th century. History The main courtyard and the surviving maple tree, while the overgrown vegetation covers the rest of the promontory The red-tinged walls of the eastern facade remained after the fire that engulfed the palacete The dual vaulted-ceiling cistern occupying a comparable space alongside the main house, with shell decorated fountain (to the left) Pilar was the late 18th century residence of Manuel In√°cio de Souza Sarmento, a rich politician in the municipal council of Horta and property-owner. He inherited from his father, brother and father-in-law a vast inheritance that he parlayed into property on the island, becoming a self-made millionaire in the process. Unlike many of the many estates in the Azores, this manor did not have any ancillary buildings normally associated with agricultural activities. It was conceived, along with many of the original structures, as a property of leisure, a residence with two floors with access directly to the main garden. Much of the palacette was constructed to function with the natural landscape. The two larger facades, oriented towards the south and east, were covered with windows giving views of Horta and Pico. The building was encircled with artificial platforms, delimited by median walls that were at the time gardened, but today are mere pasture. At the time, the mansion on Pilar was known for its library, considered more valuable then the libraries of the Franciscan friars of Horta, covered in wood brought back from Brazil and its ceiling encrusted with silver that imitated the heavens. The construction of the property was made from material almost totally imported onto the island. The house was decorated with mirrors, chandeliers, crystal and porcelain. Its well-manicured garden included laneways lined with exotic plants and marble pool. The home was the site of elegant parties and formal receptions, as well as meetings of intellectuals, family members and the high-society of Horta. Sarmento kept to his nest on Lomba, and only ventured out to the city in his golden litter and always with an attendant by his side. At the time of his death, the legendary patrimony was divided between his unscrupulous descendants. The ornate woods, windows, doors and decorations were all sold (even the marble pool was carted- off to personal residence in S√£o Miguel) and in a few years, all had been lost by his successors. Dr. Ant√¥nio Severino de Avelar bought and recuperated what remained of the property, which was later inherited by his son-in-law, the Viscount of Leite Perry.Anecdotally, the Viscount once explained that one day a urchin child had come to the garden, from the open gate. Once interrogated, the humble child, looking poorly dressed, had informed the Viscount that he was a descendant of the old seigneurs, referring to Dr. Sarmento. Sometime in the 20th century, the abandoned structure was engulfed in flames, and the remainder of its floors were destroyed; there are still obvious remnants of the fire that burned down the two-storey building, leaving behind charred walls, flaked plaster and burnt beams. The Palacete, along with the nearby Hermitage of Pilar were designated as components of a group of architectonic features whose preservation was important to the city of Horta, by the Regional Government of the Azores on 16 April 2010, as part of the Urbanization plan. Architecture Access to the property is made from alleyways: one extending from the children's playground in Largo Cardeal D. Jos√© da Costa Nunes, and the other from a cul-de-sac off Cal√ßada da Lomba and Cal√ßada da Concei√ß√£o. Both are narrow access-ways/trails that over-covered with vegetation. The space is a landscape consisting of main building, encircled by a series of terraces, partially gardened, and supported by walls with a forested spaces in the rear. Included are three large cisterns (two twinned), as well as a rectangular pond with rock in its centre. The residence is a two-storey building, in a L plan with only its walls still standing, covered in ornate late-Baroque frame windows. These walls are constructed of plastered stone masonry and painted in reddish pigment. To the rear of the main building is a more recent kitchen annex that runs parallel to the principal body that defines a servant's courtyard. This space is delimited by a wall, and partially, by the two cisterns with vaulted ceilings. In several locations, including on the eastern wall of the cistern and western wall of the building are decorated \\"fountains\\" plastered with shells. Of the various platforms, the principal facade (oriented towards the southeast and the city of Horta) is encircled by side walls ornamented with shell-like sculptures at their corners. This facade is also the location of a grand outdoor double staircase, that descends to a narrow platform that functioned as a lookout or Baroque theatre.

The Xiang Hua Men has a complement of 28 mariners. Early reports said it was unknown if any of the crew had been injured, or what became of the pirates. China Daily reports the crew members shut down all power systems and retreated to the ship's security room when they saw the pirates approach. The vessel was occupied by the pirates for nine hours. The pirates boarded the vessel 25 minutes after they were sighted, and it took them three hours to breach three of the four security doors to the ship's security room. At that point the crew surrendered, and the pirates made them line the bridge, to serve as human shields. The ship's captain He Feng noticed the two Iranian patrol vessels were shadowing the ship. Ship's engineer Li Shengming told the pirates he had to take his engineering staff to the engine room, to monitor the ship's engines. However, when the first mate, on the bridge, informed him that the Iranians had covertly requested the vessel be stopped, he and his staff stopped the engines and jumped overboard. When members of the remaining crew were ordered to start the engines they claimed all the crew members qualified to do so were among those who had jumped overboard. As the Iranian boarding party approached gunfire was exchanged between the pirates and the Iranian commandos. One crew member, Li Guwen was slightly injured.

Built in Germany in 1958, it was a single seat, span aircraft. Only one was built; it later flew for several years with Akaflieg Stuttgart. Design and development The first glider with a GRP structure was the Akaflieg Stuttgart Ph√∂nix which flew in November 1957. Wolf Hirth had followed its construction with interest and had hoped to manufacture it. Instead, the Ph√∂nix was produced by B√∂lkow and Hirth built his own design, the Hi-25 Kria, using the construction methods developed for the Ph√∂nix. As well as their structural similarity, the Kria and the Ph√∂nix shared some aerodynamic features, particularly Eppler airfoils and fuselages which conformed to the upward flowing air ahead of the wings and downwash behind. The Kria, though, was a high wing rather than mid-wing monoplane, was smaller overall (the Ph√∂nix had a 16 m span) and had a butterfly tail. Kr√≠a is the Icelandic name for the Arctic tern. The Kria's cantilever wing was straight tapered over all the span except for elliptical tips, with an unswept leading edge and a forward swept trailing edge. There was no dihedral. The wings carried short span ailerons at the tips and undersurface airbrakes, which could be extended at 90¬∞ to the airflow, inboard. The tail surfaces, separated by 110¬∞, had swept leading edges and rounded tips. The airflow-conforming aerodynamics of the fuselage gave it a rather humped back profile, with the dorsal line dropping away aft of the wing to a slender tail. Ahead of the wing the combined canopy-nose line was almost straight. A single piece canopy covered a cockpit which fitted only the smallest pilots. The underside of the forward fuselage was bulged and carried a close-fitting landing skid, which was assisted by an integral tail bumper. The Kria was first flown on 31 December 1958, piloted by Rudi Lindner. It was pleasant to fly though rather lacking aileron response. Despite not being designed for serious competition, it performed better than any other span sailplane of its time. Operational history After Hirth died in a flying accident in 1959 the Kria was donated to the Akaflieg Stuttgart. It flew from their Hahnweide base for several years, also participating in glider evaluation courses under OSTIV auspices. Stored after retirement, the sole Kria was lost in a hangar fire in 2001.

They each guided their owners out of the burning towers before they collapsed, feats which were later recognized when they were awarded the Dickin Medal by the British charity the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals. Roselle went on to be posthumously named American Hero Dog of the Year 2011 by American Humane, and has a book written about her. Salty Salty (December 12, 1996 ‚Äì March 28, 2008) was trained as a guide dog in early 1998 by Guiding Eyes for the Blind in Yorktown Heights, New York. Part of his training included taking trips on the New York City Subway and getting used to traffic in the Bronx. Omar Rivera was introduced to Salty by Salty's instructor, Caroline McCabe-Sandler. When the attacks occurred on September 11, 2001, Salty and his owner, Omar Rivera, found themselves on the 71st floor. Rivera was working at the headquarters of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, in Tower 1 of the World Trade Center. After refusing to leave Rivera's side, Salty and Rivera's supervisor, Donna Enright, led him to safety. About halfway down, a co-worker, trying to help, tried to take Salty's lead but the dog refused to leave Omar. Roselle Roselle (March 12, 1998 ‚Äì June 26, 2011) was born in San Rafael, California, on March 12, 1998, at the Guide Dogs for the Blind. She was moved to Santa Barbara, California, to be raised by Kay and Ted Stern. After this she was returned to Guide Dogs for the Blind so that she could be trained as a guide dog. Roselle and her owner, Michael Hingson, first met on November 22, 1999. She was Hingson's fifth guide dog. Roselle was asleep under her owner's desk on the 78th floor in Tower 1 of the World Trade Center when the attack commenced. She was awakened by the plane impacting some fifteen floors above them. Roselle calmly helped Hingson to stairwell B, despite the smoke, confusion and noise surrounding her. She led her owner and 30 other people down 1,463 steps out of the tower. After descending over half the distance, they passed the firemen who were heading up, who Roselle stopped to greet. The descent took just over an hour. Just after they exited the tower, Tower 2 collapsed, sending debris flying. Hingson later said, \\"While everyone ran in panic, Roselle remained totally focused on her job, while debris fell around us, and even hit us, Roselle stayed calm.\\" Once clear, Roselle led her owner to the safety of a subway station, where they helped a woman who had been blinded by falling debris. Once they arrived home, Roselle immediately began playing with her retired guide dog predecessor, Linnie, as if nothing important had happened. After the attacks, Hingson changed careers from a computer salesman to working for the Guide Dogs for the Blind as Public Affairs Director. Hingson and Roselle appeared on numerous television shows including Larry King Live, the CBS Morning Show and Regis and Kelly. They also appeared on a float during the 2002 Rose Parade in Pasadena, CA. In 2004, Roselle was diagnosed with immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, but medications were able to control the condition. In March 2007 she retired from guiding after it was discovered that the medication was beginning to damage her kidneys. She continued to live with Hingson, who was assigned a new guide dog, Africa. On June 24, 2011, Hingson suspected that something was wrong with Roselle and took her to her local vet, who diagnosed her with a stomach ulcer. Roselle died two days later on June 26, at 8:52 pm. In her memory, Hingson wrote a book of their 9/11 experience entitled Thunder Dog: The True Story of a Blind Man, His Guide Dog, and the Triumph of Trust at Ground Zero and set up Roselle's Dream Foundation a 501c3 charitable foundation to raise money to help vision-impaired people engage more fully in everyday life. In 2020, the podcast This is Love spoke with Michael Hingson about his life with Roselle and their 9/11 experience. Dickin Medal, awards and other dedications Salty and Roselle were awarded a joint Dickin Medal by the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals on March 5, 2002. It was only the second time that a joint medal had been awarded, the first time to Punch and Judy, a pair of Boxers in 1946. Salty and Roselle's medal citation reads, \\"For remaining loyally at the side of their blind owners, courageously leading them down more than 70 floors of the World Trade Center and to a place of safety following the terrorist attack on New York on September 11, 2001.\\" This was not the only Dickin Medal to be awarded for actions related to the attacks; German Shepherd Appollo received a medal on behalf of all the work done by all search and rescue dogs following the attacks. The Dickin Medal is often referred to as the animal metaphorical equivalent of the Victoria Cross. In addition to the Dickin Medal, Salty and Roselle were also each recognized by the British Guide Dogs for the Blind Association. Salty and Rivera were awarded a 'Partners in Courage' award by the Guiding Eyes for the Blind association. Roselle was posthumously named American Hero Dog of the Year in 2011 by the American Humane Society, beating seven other finalists in a public vote which saw more than 400,000 people vote. In 2009, Michael Gaither wrote and published a song titled \\"Roselle\\" about Roselle's life. It appeared on his album Dogspeed released in 2009.

He is known for his work as a historian of mathematics, his editorships of mathematical journals and his contributions to the teaching of mathematics. Biography Raymond Clare Archibald was born in South Branch, Stewiacke, Nova Scotia on 7 October 1875. He was the son of Abram Newcomb Archibald (1849‚Äì1883) and Mary Mellish Archibald (1849‚Äì1901). He was the fourth cousin twice removed of the famous Canadian-American astronomer and mathematician Simon Newcomb. Archibald graduated in 1894 from Mount Allison College with B.A. degree in mathematics and teacher's certificate in violin. After teaching mathematics and violin for a year at the Mount Allison Ladies' College he went to Harvard where he received a B.A. 1896 and a M.A. in 1897. He then traveled to Europe where he attended the University of Berlin during 1898 and received a Ph.D.cum laude from the University of Strassburg in 1900. His advisor was Karl Theodor Reye and title of his dissertation was The Cardioide and Some of its Related Curves.

After a one-year appointment at Acadia University he accepted an invitation of join the mathematics department at Brown University. He stayed at Brown for the rest of his career becoming a Professor Emeritus in 1943. While at Brown he created one of the finest mathematical libraries in the western hemisphere. Archibald returned to Mount Allison in 1954 to curate the Mary Mellish Archibald Memorial Library, the library he had founded in 1905 to honor his mother. At his death the library contained 23,000 volumes, 2,700 records, and 70,000 songs in American and English poetry and drama. Raymond Clare Archibald was a world-renowned historian of mathematics with a lifelong concern for the teaching of mathematics in secondary schools. At the presentation of his portrait to Brown University the head of the mathematics department, Professor Clarence Raymond Adams said of him: \\"The instincts of the bibliophile were also his from early years.

The Suguta River originates in a stream of near-boiling water that emerges from the side of Mount Silali, an extinct volcano. Some geologists speculate that the Kapedo hot spring, which drops through a set of waterfalls to the Sugutu river, is the outlet from Lake Baringo to the south. At one point the Suguta River passes between two volcanoes and is fed from both sides by hot springs. In places the banks of the Suguta River are lined with palms. The river and its tributaries are home to a cichlid, the Suguta tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus sugutae). Although the river dries up after the rainy season, the fish survive in pools.

The coating serves to protect the water supply lines from corrosion whether from the outside or the inside. It also serves to protect the drinking water from contamination. The coating is an emulsion manufactured using asphaltene and water primarily, with other raw materials according to the manufacturer's specifications. History Water-based coatings began development in the late 1980s. In the early 1990s they began to be widely used, specifically marketed towards drinking water supply lines. Previously, water supply lines were coated using a harmful solvent-based coating, using such solvents as benzene, toluene, hexane and other volatile organic compounds (VOC). Manufacturing These coatings are manufactured using a batching system. A solution of raw materials and water is prepared, and the solution is milled with an asphaltene, which serves as a clean building block and a base resin. After the material is processed, it goes through a series of let-down, filtering, and quality control tests. Uses The major use of water based pipe coating is for ductile iron pipe that comprises water supply lines infrastructure. It can also be utilized for pipe flanges and fittings, gray iron pipe (sewer lines), storm water sealing, utility box sealing, and septic tank and vault sealing.

While roller coasters are a popular theme park attraction, certain people feel nauseated, afraid, dizzy, or unsafe when riding roller coasters. In many cases, this fear is related to other phobias ‚Äì such as acrophobia, claustrophobia or emetophobia ‚Äì a condition like vertigo, or to a traumatic event. While not an officially recognized phobia, some cases have been treated successfully with a specialized therapy program. Contributing factors =Acrophobia= Most roller coasters combine substantial heights with seemingly insignificant support, as well as free-falls and the illusion of uncontrolled drops. Because acrophobia involves an extreme fear of heights and falling, these conditions could cause someone who is an acrophobic to have an extremely negative reaction to riding roller coasters. =Claustrophobia= Claustrophobia involves two parts, fear of physical restraint and fear of suffocation. The safety harnesses and enclosures on some rollercoaster and other rides are very restrictive, in order to protect the riders from harm. In addition, the speed of these rides can cause air displacement that makes it difficult for riders to catch their breath. Both of these issues can trigger claustrophobic responses in riders. =Vertigo= Vertigo is a type of dizziness where a person feels as if they or the objects around them are moving when they are not. Common causes of vertigo include looking down from a great height and persistent movement, hence it contributing to a phobia of riding rollercoasters. =Emetophobia= Emetophobia is the fear of vomiting. Individuals who suffer from any degree of motion sickness are more likely to become nauseous and vomit during or after riding a rollercoaster. If they also experience anxiety as a result of the need to vomit, this can contribute to a fear of rides that can involve fast and erratic movements. =Traumatic experience= If an individual does not have other phobias which can elicit fear responses on a rollercoaster, it's possibly the result of an intense, frightening event that happened while on a ride ‚Äì in particular being on a ride that experienced mechanical failure or witnessing such a failure. It could also result from someone being allowed to ride a rollercoaster when they were too young to be able to process the sensations they experienced. Symptoms Coasterphobia, like most recognized and unrecognized phobias, is an anxiety condition. Therefore its main symptom is a panic attack, which can include shortness of breath, rapid breathing, irregular heartbeat, sweating, nausea, heart palpitations, and dizziness, and a sense of dread. Fear of these rides is similar to a fear of flying in an airplane, in that while statistically, it is rare for someone to be injured or die from riding on a rollercoaster, it is an activity which carries some risk. Therefore they fall under phobias that are extreme over-reactions to normal self-preservation instincts. Treatment In 1999, Dr. Michael Otto, Ph.D. - director of the Translational Research Program at the Center for Anxiety and Related Disorders and Professor of Psychology at Boston University ‚Äì was hired by Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida to come up with a solution to rollercoaster aversion caused by fear. Michael Otto worked with fellow psychologist Brian Newmark to develop the \\"Coasterphobia Stress Management Program.\\" The intent was to teach \\"coasterphobics\\" techniques that they could use before and during the ride to reduce their anxiety. The program included muscle tension and breathing techniques in line with other forms of anxiety management, and simulating specific sensations associated with riding rollercoasters, while in a controlled and safe environment. The program was successful with the initial test group. Similar self-help techniques can be found online, for reducing the phobic reaction to rollercoasters and similar rides.

Someone has \\"high erotic plasticity\\" when their sex drives can be affected by situational, social and cultural influences, whereas someone with \\"low erotic plasticity\\" has a sex drive that is relatively rigid and unsusceptible to change. Since social psychologist Roy Baumeister coined the term in 2000, only two studies directly assessing erotic plasticity have been completed .Benuto, L. (2010). Exploring erotic plasticity as an individual difference variable: Theory and measurement. Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering, 7263. The female erotic plasticity hypothesis states that women have higher erotic plasticity than men, and therefore their sex drives are more socially flexible and responsive than those of men (factors such as religion, culture and education have a greater effect on women's sexual behaviors). Men, on the other hand, remain relatively rigid after puberty but can still be affected by these factors. Female erotic plasticity hypothesis As women have been theorised to possess a weaker sex drive than men, they may more readily accept substitutes or alternate forms of satisfaction. Baumeister theorized that weaker motivations tend to lead to greater plasticity. However, a lower sex drive does not necessarily imply that sex is less important for women, or that females have a lower capacity to become aroused. Rather, Baumeister's hypothesis supports the notion that women are less willing to engage in sex than their male counterparts. =Evidence for female erotic plasticity= Culture According to Baumeister, the culture a woman is raised in affects her sexual attitudes and behaviours more than it would affect a man raised in the same culture. Factors such as politics, cultural and societal views on sexual behaviours would all play a role. A multinational study by Lippa (2009) found that women are more variable in their sex drives, suggesting that their sexuality is more malleable and influenced by society than men's. Another study showed that South Korean women had a higher median age of first intercourse, lower rates of premarital sex, and greater disapproval of premarital sex. In South Korea, there are strong gender-based sexual double standards such that women are expected to be passive and virgins at marriage. Therefore, Baumeister theorized that cultural norms have affected women's attitudes and behaviours more so than men. Another study showed that female, but not male, Hispanic immigrants to the United States were less likely to engage in vaginal, oral, and anal sex than Hispanics who had been born and raised in the United States. Condom use was unaffected by whether or not the person was an immigrant, suggesting that upbringing and acculturation had a significant impact on engaging in sexual activity and not on how they would protect themselves during sex. Baumeister predicted that acculturation, the process of adopting the behaviour patterns and attitudes of the surrounding culture, should have a greater effect on the sexual behaviours and attitudes of female immigrants. However, in a study conducted by Benuto and Meana, one of the two studies conducted about erotic plasticity, supporting evidence was not found. When examining the acculturation of college students from an American college of non-American background, acculturation had the same effect on sexual behaviours and attitudes of both men and women. Numerous potential methodological flaws of the study are indicated that may have produced this contradictory data, such as women trying to appear socially desirable in their responses (see social desirability bias) or that participants were too acculturated. Religion Catholic nuns are more successful at fulfilling their vows of celibacy and more willing to commit to their promises of sexual abstinence than male clergy, suggesting women can more easily adapt to such high non-permissive standards.Murphy, S. (1992). A delicate dance: Sexuality, celibacy, and relationships among Catholic clergy and religious. New York: Crossroad. A study on older unmarried adults found that those who were highly religious were less likely to have recently had sex compared to non-religious unmarried adults. However, this effect was stronger in women, suggesting a stronger influence on women's sexual behaviour. Church attendance and religiosity is also associated with lower odds of reporting masturbation among females. One possible explanation is that higher levels of spirituality and religiosity are associated with higher levels of sex guilt in women. One study even suggests that this differs amongst women of different culture. Religious Euro-Canadian women reported significantly higher levels of sexual desire and less sex guilt than Eastern Asian women. This is an example of two societal pressures, religion and culture, interacting to shape sexuality. Finally, Farmer and colleagues (2009) found that unreligious women are more likely to engage in unrestricted premarital intercourse behaviour than religious women. Such a difference was not demonstrated in religious and non-religious men. =Adolescent sexuality= Religiosity can also affect whether adolescents choose to abstain from sexual conduct. Commitment to religion and having friends with similar commitments has a stronger impact on girls than boys. Other factors, such as family members‚Äô disapproval of adolescent sexual behaviour also play a significant role. Heritability Heritability is the amount of differences between individuals that is the product of genetics. According to female erotic plasticity theory, sexual behaviours of men should be more heritable because there is a stronger biological component driving these behaviours. A study examining adult twins in Sweden found a lower genetic component for the engagement in same-sex behaviours in women than in men. Shared environment also played a larger role in women's same-sex behaviours than in men's, although unique environmental factors were roughly the same. On the other hand, in their study of Australian twins, Bailey, Dunne and Martin found a concordance in sexual behaviour of 20% for male MZ twins, and of 24% for female MZ twins. Another twin study showed male identical twins are more likely than female identical twins to begin having sex at the same age. Shared environment plays a greater role than genetics in risky sexual behaviours in adolescent females. Attitude‚Äìbehaviour inconsistencies Baumeister's 3rd prediction states that women should have greater inconsistencies between their attitudes towards sexual behaviours and whether they actually engage in said behaviours. Wives are more likely than husbands to report that they changed a \\"great deal\\" in their habits, ideas and expectations of sex over 20 years of marriage. Even more husbands reported that their spouses changed than did wives. Another example is condom use, for which women in the past have demonstrated difficulty in expressing their desire to use them during sex. However, a 2008 study by Woolf and Maisto found that this trend is declining, suggesting traditional gender roles in culture may be changing. Gender similarities Although the female erotic plasticity theory states that the men's and women's sexuality are different, some evidence suggests that men's sexuality too can be affected by sociocultural factors. Although religious commitment and family member's stances on adolescent sexual behaviours have a significant impact on females' choice to abstain, to a lesser extent it affects males' choice as well. Also, the fact that some male clergy are successful in maintaining their vows of celibacy suggests some degree of erotic plasticity. College education is associated with an increase in variety of sexual behaviours in both men and women. Asian males and females consistently report more conservative sexual attitudes than Hispanic and Euro-Americans. Sexual arousal According to Meredith Chivers, straight women are physically aroused by a greater variety of erotic images than men, and this physical arousal does not match subjective arousal. Similar results were found in a study that showed both consensual and non-consensual sex scenes to men and women. Neither men nor women reported sexual arousal to the rape scenes, but women's bodies responded in a similar way to both scenarios. This may be because women's physical arousal, regardless of psychological arousal, is an evolutionary automatic response to prevent damage during rape. A study that measured sexual arousal through pupil dilation found that physical response of lesbian and bisexual women to erotic images was more category-specific than that of straight women, with lesbian women showing more response to women, and bisexual women showing more response to the preferred sex than the other. This may be due to masculinization of the brain via prenatal hormones. The difference between straight and non-straight women was consistent with Chivers' findings, although straight women did show more consistency with their orientation with this measure than with the genital measure. Sexual fluidity and same-sex behaviours Sexual fluidity is the concept that sexual orientation or sexuality is not rigid, but rather can change over time. According to Lisa Diamond, developer of the concept, women generally tend to be more fluid in their sexuality than men.Diamond, L. M. (2008). Sexual Fluidity: Understanding Women‚Äôs Love and Desire. Cambridge: Harvard University Press In her study of lesbian, bisexual and unlabeled women, she found that these had a tendency of changing their sexual identities and behaviour over time. Other studies have shown as well greater fluidity among lesbians, compared with homosexual men. However, heterosexual men and women were equally stable in their orientation, and bisexual men and women were similarly unstable.http://midus.wisc.edu/findings/pdfs/1153.pdf Often, sexual orientation and sexual orientation identity are not distinguished, which can impact accurately assessing sexual identity and whether or not sexual orientation is able to change; sexual orientation identity can change throughout an individual's life, and may or may not align with biological sex, sexual behavior or actual sexual orientation.Sinclair, Karen, About Whoever: The Social Imprint on Identity and Orientation, NY, 2013 Sexual orientation is stable and unlikely to change for the vast majority of people, but some research indicates that some people may experience change in their sexual orientation, and this is more likely for women than for men.  The American Psychological Association distinguishes between sexual orientation (an innate attraction) and sexual orientation identity (which may change at any point in a person's life). Women who remained in relationships with male- to-female transsexuals maintained a heterosexual identity, yet reported changes in their sexual lives. (Aramburu Alegr√≠a, 2012)Aramburu Alegr√≠a, C. (2012). Relational and sexual fluidity in females partnered with male-to- female transsexual persons. Journal of Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing, 2012 Feb 1, 1-8 Some women reported that their relationships no longer included sexual activity, while others reported that things were still changing. According to Lippa (2006), heterosexual women with high sex drives tend to be attracted to both women and men, whereas heterosexual men with high sex drives are only associated with attraction to either women or men, suggesting greater plasticity in women's sexuality. Erotic plasticity and gender/sexual variation Lesbians are more likely than gay men to engage in heterosexual sex, suggesting greater variability in their sexuality.Baumeister, R. F. & Stillman, T. (2006). Erotic Plasticity: Nature, Culture, Gender, and Sexuality. In R. D. McAnulty & M. M Burnette (Eds.), Sex and Sexuality, Volume 1 (pp. 343-359). Westport: Praeger PublishersBart, P. B. (1993). Protean women: The liquidity of female sexuality and the tenaciousness of lesbian identity. In S. Wilkinson & C. Kitzinger (Eds.), Heterosexuality: Feminism and psychology reader (pp. 246-252). London: Sage No research has been done on people with gender variation, such as transgender people. Little is known about erotic plasticity in transsexuals. Sexual reassignment surgery and hormone therapy (i.e. testosterone) in female-to-male transsexuals produce an increase in their sexual desire, but it is uncertain how erotic plasticity plays a role. Heterosexual female-to-male transsexuals ‚Äì those who are sexually attracted to women ‚Äì have more sexual partners than nonheterosexual female-to-male transsexuals, but again, erotic plasticity's role in this - if one actually exists - is uncertain. Erotic Plasticity Questionnaire In her Ph.D. dissertation in 2009, Lorraine Benuto attempted to create a scale measuring erotic plasticity. Her scale, the EPQ (Erotic Plasticity Questionnaire), contained the following subscales, each believed to be a component of erotic plasticity: * Fluidity (of behaviours on the same- sex/opposite-sex continuum) * Attitude-Behaviour Inconsistency * Changes in Attitudes (over time) * Perception of Choice * Sociocultural Influence When administered to a test population, women scored higher on fluidity, attitude- behaviour inconsistency, and overall erotic plasticity. There were no significant gender differences in changes in attitudes, perception of choice and sociocultural influences. The test also did not demonstrate any relationship between erotic plasticity and locus of control, sexual liberality and openness. Benuto also did not find a negative correlation between sex drive and EPQ score, which is unexpected. This is either because of a methodological problem in the scale or a problem in Baumeister's hypothesis that plasticity is related to sex drive. Furthermore, the subscales of the EPQ did not correlate well with each other, leading Benuto to hypothesize that perhaps there is not just one type of plasticity, but plasticities, and erotic plasticity is a much more complicated construct than initially imagined. Contrary to the numerous studies Baumeister cites as evidence of sociocultural influences on women, Benuto did not find a gender difference on the sociocultural influence subscale. However, Baumeister's cited studies were not self-report studies, whereas Benuto's scale was, which may have contributed to the discrepancy. Applications in sex therapy Baumeister provided three applications of the theory of erotic plasticity in sex therapy. Sex differences in erotic plasticity can change how therapists will approach providing sex therapy to men and women. Baumeister found that cognitive therapy would be a better approach for female patients because sexual responses and behaviours are influenced by what things mean, therefore working with women's interpretations and understanding of these responses and behaviours would be of greatest benefit. Physiological therapy, such as hormone therapy, would therefore be best for male patients, since the focus would be more on the body than on the man's cognitions. Also, someone with high erotic plasticity will have less sexual self-knowledge and self- understanding than someone with low erotic plasticity since their behaviours and tastes are susceptible to change; this knowledge could be useful in helping someone perhaps confused about his or her sexual identity. Finally, prospects for successful sex therapy may be better for women than men, because if men develop a problem, their low plasticity will make it difficult to allow significant change after puberty. Other useful applications of erotic plasticity in sex therapy include having women place much consideration in family and peer relationships, and any internal and external pressures that may be affecting their sexual identity, such as religious influences, cultural norms and politics. Criticism and alternate explanations Baumeister's theory of female erotic plasticity has been met with some criticism. Some argue Baumeister makes causal inferences from correlational research when discussing how education affects men and women differently. He was also criticized for his use of extreme groups to support his predictions, such as people of the least and most education. Below are two posited alternate explanations of erotic plasticity: =Shibley Hyde and Durik= In a 2000 paper, Janet Shibley Hyde and Amanda M. Durik argued that a more sociocultural explanation could be used to explain erotic plasticity. Firstly, education does not affect men's and women's sexual behaviour differently. Instead, it increases women's power, therefore women with the greatest amount of education are nearly equal in power with men. On the other hand, women who are the least educated have the least power relative to men. When comparing sexual behaviours of most educated and least educated men and women, they found that education actually increased the prevalence of many sexual activities in both sexes, including oral sex, anal sex, and having a same sex partner. The differences between men and women were much smaller in the most educated group than in the least educated group. Shibley Hyde and Durik speculate that more educated women are better at communicating their desires and have enough self- confidence to do so. They also may perform a greater variety of sexual activities because of their greater exposure to ideas and their commitment to learning. Shibley Hyde and Durik also asserted that religion has a greater effect on women's sexual behaviours because a group with less power ‚Äì in this case, women ‚Äì will shape their behaviour to be more like the group with power, in this case, men. Therefore, women pay more attention to and conform more to religious teachings since it is the culture to which they must adapt. They back up this claim by presenting evidence that non-religious women and men are similar in the prevalence of all sexual activities, minus masturbation. On the contrary, Conservative Protestant men and women differed significantly in all sexual behaviours. They also argued for a modern sexual double standard that is more restrictive of female sexuality than male sexuality. They claimed that now, extramarital sex is more tolerated in women than in the past, but it is still less acceptable in women than in men. Therefore, these different gender roles will exert powerful influences on both men's and women's behaviour and sexuality. Finally, they claim that the greater evidence for attitude- behaviour inconsistency in women is not the result of high erotic plasticity, but because of men's greater interpersonal power. Although women may, for example, have the intention of using condoms or have negative attitudes towards anal sex, men may use their greater power to do what it is they desire if it differs from what their partner wants. =Benuto= Benuto (2009) argues that heightened fluidity and sociocultural influences, two components of erotic plasticity, actually stand in opposition to each other. Although scientific evidence exists that women's sexual behaviours are indeed more fluid than men's, Benuto argues there is nothing in society that would encourage women to engage in same-sex behaviour. She hypothesizes that, based on the properties of her EPQ scale (Benuto, 2009), erotic plasticity may not be a unitary construct like Baumeister initially proposed, and that there perhaps may be multiple ‚Äúplasticities‚Äù, each composed of different constructs. Such constructs include sociocultural influences, locus of control and changes of sexual attitudes over time. Finally, it is possible that the heightened attitude-behaviour inconsistency in women could either be due to the powerlessness of women, or women wanting to maintain harmony and nurturance in their relationship.

It involved a combination of psychological warfare (PSYWAR) and psychological operations (PSYOP), today known as military information support operations (MISO). The SSPL was \\"planned and implemented beginning in April 1963,\\" though it continued to develop through 1968.Friedman, Herbert A. The Sacred Sword of the Patriots League. Retrieved 2012-4-24. It formed the centerpiece of various PSYOP directed against North Vietnam, which were codenamed Humidor.Schultz, Richard H. Jr., The Secret War Against Hanoi. HarperCollins, 1999. p. 137. It attempted to convince the people‚Äîand sometimes the government‚Äîof North Vietnam of the existence of an autonomous, non-communist society within North Vietnam. Creating and promulgating the \\"legend\\" of the SSPL required U.S. Special Forces to build on PSYWAR techniques established by the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) during World War II. Some historians believe the SSPL managed to divert the attention of North Vietnamese officials enough to justify its expenses and manpower. However, the program is not known for any particularly noteworthy successes and it suffered from a lack of direction regarding its ultimate goals. Recurring disagreements between some military leaders in Vietnam and policymakers in Washington kept the program from ever becoming an actual counterrevolutionary force within North Vietnam. It was mostly disbanded in 1968 following an early round of negotiations in what became the Paris Peace Accords of 1973. Origins =U.S. historical precedent= The SSPL drew from a short history of elaborate deceptions in U.S. military history. Historian John Plaster asserts that the MACV-SOG branch which ran the SSPL was \\"patterned after the old OSS Morale Operations Division,\\" formed by William Donavan in 1943.Plaster, John H., SOG: The Secret Wars of America's Commandos in Vietnam. Simon & Schuster, 1997. p. 118. The comparison is apt, as both largely relied on deceptive radio operations, fraudulent letters, and distribution of leaflets. The SSPL also benefited from the experiences of Herbert Weisshart, who was appointed Deputy Head of MACV-SOG's PSYOP at its inception. Unlike most SOG commanders, Weisshart arrived with experience PSYOP. \\"Part of a six-man psychological warfare team dispatched to Taiwan in 1952, he had been instrumental in coordinating leaflet drops and radio play against China in support of one of the Central Intelligence Agency's first notional resistance campaigns.\\" Conboy, Kenneth and Dale Andrade, Spies and Commandos: How America Lost the Secret War in North Vietnam. University Press of Kansas, 2000. p. 77. Still operating in 1963, Weisshart's fictional resistance movement against mainland China became the CIA's \\"longest running notional campaign.\\" MACV-SOG-designed insignia of the Sacred Sword of the Patriots League =The \\"Legend\\" of the SSPL= The American founders of the SSPL chose to root it in popular Vietnamese history. The name hearkened back to the 15th century Emperor of Vietnam, L√™ L·ª£i, who led a revolt against Chinese rule. His guerrilla warfare tactics succeeded in winning Vietnam's independence from China after 1,000 years of subservience. Sometime after the war, L√™ L·ª£i's famous sword was taken from him by a turtle. The Emperor declared that the sword had been entrusted to him for the duration of the war, only to be taken by the turtle of the Lake of the Returned Sword after his victory. The story of L√™ L·ª£i fulfilled Weisshart's declared goal of pursuing \\"a legend and an easily recognized symbol upon which to base a notional resistance movement in North Vietnam.\\" Schultz, Richard H. Jr., The Secret War Against Hanoi. HarperCollins, 1999. p. 139. It was a story that \\"Every school child in North Vietnam knew.\\" Schultz, Richard H. Jr., The Secret War Against Hanoi. HarperCollins, 1999. p. 141. Knowing that North Vietnam relied on Chinese aid, SOG framed the SSPL as anti-Chinese nationalist movement, while steering clearly making ideological statements that might lose some North Vietnamese support. The legend also emphasized the historical union between South and North Vietnam against any kind of imperial aggression.Chandler, Robert W., War of Ideas: The U.S. Propaganda Campaign in Vietnam. Westview Press, 2011. p. 9. According to the legend, the SSPL was founded by L√™ L·ª£i admirer L√™ Qu·ªëc H√πng in response to the communist land reforms of 1953. It supposedly had 10,000 members and held its first national Congress in 1961. The SSPL opposed all foreign involvement in North and South Vietnam.Schultz, Richard H. Jr., The Secret War Against Hanoi. HarperCollins, 1999. pp. 141-2. =Early development= In April 1961, President John F. Kennedy demanded the establishment of \\"networks of resistance\\" in North Vietnam.Conboy, Kenneth and Dale Andrade, Spies and Commandos: How America Lost the Secret War in North Vietnam. University Press of Kansas, 2000. p. 75. It took government officials some time to build the resources necessary to cross the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone. Responsibility for PSYOP against North Vietnam initially went to the CIA, which continued to play a supporting role throughout the war. In 1962 the CIA identified Hmong tribesmen as worthy recruits for North Vietnamese resistance. But by the spring of 1963 their pilot program had a total of just eight recruits. CIA Deputy Chief and Chief of Operations in Saigon, William Colby, chose Herbert Weisshart to expand North Vietnamese resistance and PSYWAR operations beginning in March 1963.Schultz, Richard H. Jr., The Secret War Against Hanoi. HarperCollins, 1999. p. 130. Weisshart played a role in implementing the CINCPAC Operations Plan (OPLAN) 34-63 for PSYOP directed towards North Vietnam, which was later endorsed by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. \\"McNamara also desired the development of a notional (fictitious) Vietnamese national liberation movement, which would be the ostensible sponsor of the operations. That was, after all, what the North Vietnamese were doing in the South.\\" Gillespie, Robert M., Black Ops, Vietnam: The Operation History of MACVSOG. Naval Institute Press, 2011. p. 7. The final plan, OPLAN 34Alpha, called for the military \\"to use all available media and practical means...phantom resistance movements, and psychological development of actual resistance.\\" Gillespie, Robert M., Black Ops, Vietnam: The Operation History of MACVSOG. Naval Institute Press, 2011. p. 24. A 1966 letter from Major General Richard Abbey, the Deputy Chief of Staff MACV, crisply conveys the thought process behind the SSPL's operations. \\"The SSPL is the denial mechanism for disclaiming U.S. and Republic of Vietnam sponsorship of Operation Plan 34A activities...The cover story for the SSPL will be that it is the action arm of the front and that it receives it[s] funds from the front. By avoiding public announcement of responsibility for OPLAN 34A operations the SSPL group will not be forced to provide answers to such questions as: Where did the boats come from? Who paid for them? Where are they based? SSPL broadcasts, which the local Saigon residents might hear, can be explained by saying that the SSPL rented air from a local station.\\"Friedman, Herbert A. \\"The Sacred Sword of the Patriots League.\\" Retrieved 2012-4-24. The SSPL was conceived as the covert U.S. counterpoint to recognized North Vietnamese support of the Viet Cong in South Vietnam. The main difference is that the SSPL's existence was \\"notional, whereas the Viet Cong was real. As the mandate for PSYOP against North Vietnam expanded, U.S. officials decided that the large force required would be better left to the Pentagon instead of the CIA. The transfer, which took place in November 1963, was termed Operation Switchback. Herb Weisshert was transferred to the newly formed MACV-SOG, with operation described in OPLAN 34Alpha to start on 1 February 1964.Gillespie, Robert M., Black Ops, Vietnam: The Operation History of MACVSOG. Naval Institute Press, 2011. p. 8. =The SSPL and the MACV-SOG mission= According to Gordon L. Rottman, who served in MACV-SOG, U.S. Special Forces had five primary duties in the Vietnam War:Rottman, Gordon L., The MACV-SOG Reconnaissance Team in Vietnam. Osprey Publishing, 2011. p. 10. *Cross Border Operations to disrupt the Viet Cong, Khmer Rouge, Pathet Lao and NVA *Running Bright Light Operations to rescue Americans in North Vietnam *Training and dispatching agents into North Vietnam to run resistance movements and intelligence-collection *Black PSYOP *Gray PSYOP The SSPL was the focal point of Black PSYOP within MACV-SOG, which was an elite special forces unit that drew from all branches of the military as well as the CIA. MACV-SOG spread the SSPL message by air, boat, ground forces, and telecommunications. The Psychological Operations Group that developed the SSPL was instructed \\"to advise, assist, and control psychological operations of Strategic Technical Service for the purpose of establishing a climate of opinion in North Vietnam -- [Words Illegible] -- SO/STS operations, supporting SOG/STS physical destruction operations, and exerting PSYOP pressure on the North Vietnamese to erase support for activity in the Republic of Vietnam.\\" Reske, Charles F., MACV-SOG Command History: Annexes A, N & M (1964-1966). Alpha Publications, 1992. p. 83. By 1967, SOG dedicated about 150 members of its staff to covert propaganda, in addition to employing many more Vietnamese citizens for their language skills, cultural understanding and ability to act as members of the SSPL.Plaster, John H., SOG: The Secret Wars of America's Commandos in Vietnam. Simon & Schuster, 1997. p. 150. SSPL Propaganda 300px =SSPL leaflet campaign= MACV-SOG spent significant resources distributing leaflets wherever the enemy was likely to find them. Leaflets chiefly served to demoralize the enemy. During the Vietnam War, this was accomplished at least as much by the volume as the quality of the messages. A typical \\"MACV PSYOP/POLWAR Newsletter\\" from August 1969 records 683 million leaflets dropped that month alone, though leaflets dropped by SOG into North Vietnam could be numbered in the tens of millions.Chandler, Robert W., War of Ideas: The U.S. Propaganda Campaign in Vietnam. Westview Press, 2011. p. 85. Leaflets could be left on corpses, blasted out of timed cannons or dropped from aircraft. (Spies and Commandos 106) While many of these leaflets were part of the Chi√™u H·ªìi defection campaign, others specifically referenced the SSPL resistance. SOG depended on a cadre of North Vietnamese defectors to translate and perfect these messages.Schultz, Richard H. Jr., The Secret War Against Hanoi. HarperCollins, 1999. p. 144. Assessments of the effectiveness of leaflets varied. Historian Charles Reske, who annotated the command histories of MACV- SOG, comments, \\"Dropping leaflets was one of the least successful PSYOP. From beginning to end MACSOG dropped tons of leaflets in Laos, Cambodia, and North Vietnam with virtually no effect.\\" Reske, Charles F., MACV-SOG Command History: Annexes A, N & M (1964-1966). Alpha Publications, 1992. p. 85. To complicate matters, SOG forces sometimes tipped their hand by dropping the SSPL leaflets from discernibly American aircraft.Gillespie, Robert M., Black Ops, Vietnam: The Operation History of MACVSOG. Naval Institute Press, 2011. p. 210. However, SSPL leaflets may have been more effective than others because they were used in especially creative ways. Some were placed on North Vietnamese corpses in the hopes that fellow soldiers would be demoralized upon finding that their comrade was a member of the SSPL.John, Plaster L, SOG: A Photo History of the Secret War. Paladin Press, 2000. p. 451. In addition to leaflets, SOG even developed SSPL postage stamps to give the impression of the prevalence of the resistance throughout North Vietnam. Regardless of the effectiveness of the leaflets in winning support, they informed the North Vietnamese people that resistance to the regime was possible and helped distract their government from fighting the real war. =Voice of the Sacred Sword of the Patriots League (VSSPL)= The Voice of the Sacred Sword of the Patriots League (VSSPL) began broadcasting into North Vietnam in April 1965.Gillespie, Robert M., Black Ops, Vietnam: The Operation History of MACVSOG. Naval Institute Press, 2011. p. 58. The branch responsible for the broadcasts, SOG OP-33, later designated OP-39, purported to be broadcasting from within North Vietnam. Instead, the signal came from a 20-kW transmitter in Thu Duc, near Saigon.Gillespie, Robert M., Black Ops, Vietnam: The Operation History of MACVSOG. Naval Institute Press, 2011. p. 73. The VSSPL found two main ways of increasing its listenership. First, through the Peanuts project, SOG distributed thousands of radios to the North Vietnamese. They distributed 10,000 in 1968 alone.Schultz, Richard H. Jr., The Secret War Against Hanoi. HarperCollins, 1999. p. 151. These Japanese manufactured radios were designed to tune in VSSPL and other American stations while distorting North Vietnamese stations. They were inserted by various methods including reconnaissance teams, air-drops and boats.John, Plaster L, SOG: A Photo History of the Secret War. Paladin Press, 2000. p. 450. Second, the VSSPL used a variety of deceptive radio methods to subvert actual North Vietnamese broadcasts. These included \\"surfing\\" (\\"transmitting alongside a real station's frequency\\"), and \\"hitchhiking,\\" (\\"com[ing] up on the same frequency as a real station was signing off and using its call sign\\"). True to the SSPL nationalist message, the station took a non-ideological approach that emphasized traditional Vietnamese values. After developing psychological profiles of the North Vietnamese, programming was targeted towards \\"various audiences such as fishermen, Catholics, farmers, and junior cadre. [It] called for carefully planned and executed actions, most of which were passive, like spreading news of the SSPL...It also offered the SSPL viewpoint on happenings in different parts of North Vietnam.\\" Conboy, Kenneth and Dale Andrade, Spies and Commandos: How America Lost the Secret War in North Vietnam. University Press of Kansas, 2000. p. 79. VSSPL aimed to slowly break down respect for North Vietnamese leadership. One former VSSPL operator commented, \\"The 'Patriot' station pounded relentlessly at venal and immoral Communist cadres who not only diverted funds, but also seduced the young wives of NVA soldiers in the South...Our few reliable agents in the North then confirmed that those targeted by the clandestine radio were often relieved of their duties.\\" Singlaub, John K. Hazardous Duty: An American Soldier in the Twentieth Century. Summit Books, 2000. p. 296. In addition to attacking the North Vietnamese government, other broadcasts were directed towards encouraging fictional SSPL forces within North Vietnam.Schultz, Richard H. Jr., The Secret War Against Hanoi. HarperCollins, 1999. p. 163. However, in deference to policymakers, the VSSPL never advocated regime change in North Vietnam.Plaster, John H., SOG: The Secret Wars of America's Commandos in Vietnam. Simon & Schuster, 1997. p. 123. The station had some success in gaining the ears of the people and even the soldiers in North Vietnam. One North Vietnamese officer, who defected to the South, claimed, \\"he and other members of his unit listened regularly to Radio Red Flag, Radio Saigon, and the Voice of the SSPL on their unit's radio. The men were evenly divided on whether the Red Flag and VSSPL broadcasts were genuine or not. He personally believed that the VSSPL was run by Colonel Ly Van Quoc, PAVN officer who had defected to the USSR, and that the Soviets provided the broadcast facilities.\\" Gillespie, Robert M., Black Ops, Vietnam: The Operation History of MACVSOG. Naval Institute Press, 2011. p. 136. The North Vietnamese responded to U.S. PSYOP by counter-indoctrination and by discouraging any mention of enemy propaganda.Latimer, Harry D. U.S. Psychological Operations in Vietnam. Brown University, 1973. p. 119. The VSSPL continued to operate years after most of the SSPL was disbanded on November 1, 1968. =Black letters= A favorite technique of SOG was to send forged letters to North Vietnamese officials and loyalists in order draw suspicion towards them. Many of the letters, sometimes called poison pen letters, concerned alleged support for SSPL activities. SOG sent 50‚Äì100 such missives through a Hong Kong address per week, and up to 7,000 through Bangkok a year.Schultz, Richard H. Jr., The Secret War Against Hanoi. HarperCollins, 1999. p. 157. SOG intercepted one communication indicating that a North Vietnamese general who received the letter \\"was inexplicably relieved of his divisional campaign and recalled to Hanoi.\\" Conboy, Kenneth and Dale Andrade, Spies and Commandos: How America Lost the Secret War in North Vietnam. University Press of Kansas, 2000. p. 211. The sheer volume of letters allowed SOG to potentially incriminate untold numbers of North Vietnamese while enhancing the perception that the SSPL held many active members. Maritime operations and associated subversion efforts =Interdiction= SOG recruited SSPL members by kidnapping fishermen off the coast of North Vietnam. These operations, codenamed Mint (Maritime Interdictions) lasted from May 1964 to November 1968. SOG employed former inhabitants of North Vietnam, who spoke the correct dialects, to pose as SSPL members and seize the unsuspecting fishermen at gunpoint.Conboy, Kenneth and Dale Andrade, Spies and Commandos: How America Lost the Secret War in North Vietnam. University Press of Kansas, 2000. pp. 110‚Äì111. Meanwhile, American members of SOG could travelled below deck where they would not be seen. The SOG Command History states: \\"Covert boat and landing team operations were conducted against the coast of North Vietnam to interdict enemy coastal shipping, capture prisoners for interrogations and psychological warfare exploitation, and to force North Vietnam to increase its coastal defenses.\\" Reske, Charles F., MACV-SOG Command History: Annexes A, N & M (1964-1966). Alpha Publications, 1992. p. 68. SOG patrolled the waters of North Vietnam with high-speed Norwegian \\"Nasty\\" boats. Despite the program's moderate success, Mint operations sometimes ran afoul other programs. For example, In Loki missions, SOG used identical Nasty vessels to sink small Vietnamese boats, even though doing so accomplished little except angering fishermen. This problem persisted until 1968, demonstrating that the SSPL was not always fully integrated within SOG's broader efforts.Conboy, Kenneth and Dale Andrade, Spies and Commandos: How America Lost the Secret War in North Vietnam. University Press of Kansas, 2000. p. 219. SOG significantly ramped up its maritime operation in 1967 through the Forae initiative, which included operation Urgency. During Urgency, a Naval Advisory Detachment acquired additional patrol boats, allowing them to scan the North Vietnam coast for vulnerable junkets nearly every day.Conboy, Kenneth and Dale Andrade, Spies and Commandos: How America Lost the Secret War in North Vietnam. University Press of Kansas, 2000. p. 220. These activities were also served to inflame paranoia within North Vietnam and force the government to assign additional resources to defend their coasts. =Paradise Island= Perhaps the most inventive of covert SOG operations was the creation of Paradise Island (Cu Lao Cham). After capturing the fishermen for indoctrination, the SSPL took them to this island, safely located within the waters of South Vietnam. In order to give the blindfolded captives the illusion that they were still off the coast of North Vietnam, they were quickly transferred to high speed boats. Paradise Island was chosen by SOG because it appeared nearly identical to the highlands of Vietnam. Prisoners were only allowed to see a portion of the island and were told that they were in a \\"liberated zone\\" within North Vietnam. Upon arriving the fishermen were found guilty of death, but the SSPL granted them clemency. The captives found their life under the SSPL in every way superior to life under communist government. They were provided with high-calorie foods, dental care and plenty of time for rest over the course of about three weeks.Schultz, Richard H. Jr., The Secret War Against Hanoi. HarperCollins, 1999. p. 146.) The SSPL taught the fishermen the history of the resistance movement, allowed them opportunities to explain abuses and corruption under Hanoi government, and encouraged them to spread the message of the SSPL to their neighbors. Human intelligence gathered during these operations was later used for radio broadcasts, giving listeners the illusion that the SSPL had intimate knowledge of events within North Vietnam and that the broadcasts must be legitimate.Singlaub, John K. Hazardous Duty: An American Soldier in the Twentieth Century. Summit Books, 2000. pp. 296-7. By the end of the program, over 1,000 North Vietnamese had visited Paradise Island.Schultz, Richard H. Jr., The Secret War Against Hanoi. HarperCollins, 1999. p. 147. Visitors to Paradise Island were supplied with VSSPL-tuned radios and gift packages before leaving. Eventually they gave visitors two gift packages: one that was expected would be stolen by the communist government, and another to keep hidden. The long indoctrination sessions allowed SSPL leaders plenty of time to judge the motivations and loyalties of the fishermen, as well as other prisoners who were sent to Paradise Island for SSPL sessions. Under project Borden, some were sent back to collect intelligence for SSPL. Even if they decided to tell their story to the North Vietnamese authorities, doing so would only enhance the image of the SSPL and spread knowledge of its mythical history. However, those who SSPL judged to be true-believing communists were returned as pseudo-intelligence agents. Unbeknownst to the released prisoners, their clothing and luggage were lined with SSPL membership cards or leaflets that would surely be found by North Vietnamese authorities. Any attempt by the ex-prisoner to explain his loyalty would naturally fall under intense suspicion.Schultz, Richard H. Jr., The Secret War Against Hanoi. HarperCollins, 1999. pp. 113-118. Fishermen sent to Paradise Island were sometimes presented with the option of defecting to South Vietnam. Those who did so had to agree to be featured in news outlets such as the Saigon Daily News or the VSSPL. Similar to the Chi√™u H·ªìi program, their defection would be exploited in order break down the moral of North Vietnam soldiers. It is questionable whether the fishermen were taken by the Paradise Island rouse, or merely played along. At least one captive fisherman claimed to have known he was not in North Vietnam upon feeling the sand on the beach of the island. And records of some fishermen being kidnapped three separate times may indicate that the fishermen were planning their own capture in order to enjoy the amenities provided by the SSPL.Conboy, Kenneth and Dale Andrade, Spies and Commandos: How America Lost the Secret War in North Vietnam. University Press of Kansas, 2000. pp. 219-220. SSPL developed other operations relating to Paradise Island that were rejected by policymakers. These included training visitors to assassinate North Vietnamese officials, and encouraging them to develop guerilla warfare plans upon returning to North Vietnam.Schultz, Richard H. Jr., The Secret War Against Hanoi. HarperCollins, 1999. p. 148. Zealous SOG staff continued to raise the prospect of turning the SSPL into a counterrevolutionary force. The end of the SSPL =Sudden demise= SSPL operations significantly expanded in 1968 with the launch of the diversionary operation, Forae. Forae included many operations that linked SOG intelligence collection and subversive efforts with the myth of the SSPL, including sending pseudo-intelligence agents to North Vietnam for capture. Hanoi negotiators at the Paris Peace talks demanded that the U.S. shut down PSYOP directed at North Vietnam, including support for the SSPL. U.S. officials agreed to the policy and enforced it. SOG was informed that while the VSSPL radio could continue to operate, virtually other SSPL operations surrounding the SSPL, including Paradise Island, had to be shut down. SOG commanders were aghast at the decision. In one historian's assessment, \\"The announced cessation of overt U.S. operations and the sudden disappearance of SSPL craft were bound to have been noticed and linked by both the authorities and citizens of the North.\\" Gillespie, Robert M., Black Ops, Vietnam: The Operation History of MACVSOG. Naval Institute Press, 2011. p. 194. The SSPL effectively ended on November 1, 1968. A possible reason for the closure was disdain for SOG by leading members of the military and government. General Westmoreland, among many others, never put much in the SOG and its covert operations. However, SOG had itself to blame for much of this; its Research and Analysis branch never conducted a PSYWAR assessment throughout the history of the Vietnam War.Schultz, Richard H. Jr., The Secret War Against Hanoi. HarperCollins, 1999. p. 167. =Notional versus real resistance= Throughout the SSPL's history, SOG commanders proposed a number of ways of expanding the notional resistance force, many of which were turned down by policymakers. Advocates for expanding the program could point to the increasing paranoia coming out of Hanoi, North Vietnam's counterintelligence state mentality, and the creation of nineteen new capital offenses for crimes relating to SSPL operations.Gillespie, Robert M., Black Ops, Vietnam: The Operation History of MACVSOG. Naval Institute Press, 2011. p. 104. However, if the SSPL was to accomplish more than diverting Hanoi resources, it would have to be activated. In the eyes of one SOG historian, its merely notional existence made for \\"an almost crippling limitation.\\" Plaster, John H., The Secret Wars of America's Commandos in Vietnam. Simon & Schuster, 1997. p. 118. Colonel Donald D. Blackburn, who became SOG chief in June 1965, designed plans to activate the notional SSPL. Doing so, thought Blackburn, would require creating a South Vietnamese support network of religious groups and labor unions in order to support the SSPL action front. The action front would be based at a real \\"Paradise Island\\" in northwestern North Vietnam. The plan was approved by the U.S. ambassador in Saigon, Henry Cabot Lodge. However, the plan was eventually turned down.Conboy, Kenneth and Dale Andrade, Spies and Commandos: How America Lost the Secret War in North Vietnam. University Press of Kansas, 2000. pp. 137-140. Another review SOG was commissioned by General William Westmoreland in 1967. The review was known as the Brownfield Report because it was led by Brigadier General Albert Brownfield. Released on 14 February 1968 it concluded that \\"the SSPL should have, for an ultimate planning goal, the overthrow of the Hanoi Regime.\\" Gillespie, Robert M., Black Ops, Vietnam: The Operation History of MACVSOG. Naval Institute Press, 2011. p. 133. Neither General Westmoreland nor officials in Washington supported this conclusion. Military leaders and Washington officials who rejected the proposal had four primary concerns: *Doing so would violate overt U.S. policies *It could destabilize all of North Vietnam *North Vietnam might intensify operations against the south *China could decide to overtly join the Vietnam War Behind all of these objection lurked the memory of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956.Schultz, Richard H. Jr., The Secret War Against Hanoi. HarperCollins, 1999. p. 156. Badly supervised broadcasts from the American-sponsored Radio Free Europe station probably gave the Hungarians the confidence to begin a revolution. The Hungarian revolutionaries acted under the reasonable assumption that Americans would provide military backup. Policymakers did not want to see a repeat of history. It would be reckless to encourage the SSPL recruits to begin a coup in the first place, if policymakers lacked the determination to push the Vietnam War across the DMZ.

It develops and manufactures discrete magnetoresistive RAM or magnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM) products, including Toggle MRAM and Spin-Transfer Torque MRAM (STT-MRAM) product families. It also licenses its technology for use in embedded MRAM (eMRAM) applications, magnetic sensor applications as well as performs backend foundry services for eMRAM. MRAM has the performance characteristics close to static random-access memory (SRAM) while also having the persistence of non-volatile memory, meaning that it will not lose its charge or data if power is removed from the system. This characteristic makes MRAM suitable for a large number of applications where persistence, performance, endurance and reliability are critical. History  The path to MRAM began in 1984 when the GMR effect was discovered by Albert Fert and Peter Gr√ºnberg.https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2007/index.html Twelve years later, in 1996, spin-transfer torque is proposed, enabling a magnetic tunnel junction or spin valve to be modified with a spin-polarized current. At this point, Motorola began their MRAM research, which led to their first MTJ in 1998. A year later, in 1999, Motorola developed a 256Kb MRAM Test Chip that enabled work to begin on productizing MRAM technology, which was followed by a patent for Toggle being granted to Motorola in 2002. The industry's first MRAM (4Mb) product became commercially available. Much of the early MRAM work was done by Motorola, who spun off their semiconductor business in 2004, creating Freescale Semiconductor in 2008, which eventually spun out the MRAM business as Everspin Technologies. In 2008, Everspin announced BGA packages for their MRAM product family that would support densities from 256Kb to 4Mb. The following year, in 2009, Everspin released their first generation SPI MRAM product family and began shipping the first embedded MRAM samples in conjunction with GlobalFoundries. By 2010, Everspin had begun ramping production and sold its first million MRAMs. That same year qualification had completed on the industry's first embedded MRAM and 16Mb densities had been released. With production ramping, Everspin shipped its four millionth stand-alone MRAM and its two millionth embedded MRAM by 2011. The 64Mb ST-MRAM, which was produced on a 90 nm process occurred in 2012. In 2014 Everspin partnered with GlobalFoundries for production of in-plane and perpendicular MTJ ST-MRAM on 300mm wafers, utilizing 40 nm and 28 nm node processes. By 2016, Everspin had announced it was shipping samples of the industry's first 256Mb ST-MRAM to customers, GlobalFoundries announced 22 nm embedded MRAM in conjunction with Everspin, and Everspin went public in an IPO later in the year on October 7. In 2017, Everspin expanded support for MRAM to FPGAs by bringing DDR3 and DDR4 compatibility to its ST-MRAM products, making it compatible with Xilinx's UltraScale FPGA memory controller. On September 1, 2017, Kevin Conley was named Everspin CEO and President. Conley was the former CTO of SanDisk and brings enterprise storage expertise to the company. In 2018, Everspin ramped production volumes of its 256Mb STT-MRAM and in December shipped its first customer samples of the 1Gb STT-MRAM. In 2019, Everspin began pre-production of its 1Gb STT-MRAM in June and announced the expansion of the design-in ecosystem to enable system designers to implement the 1Gb ST- DDR4 product in their designs. Technology MRAM uses the magnetism of electron spin to provide fast and enduring non-volatile memory. MRAM stores information in magnetic material that is integrated with silicon circuitry to deliver the speed of RAM with the non-volatility of Flash. Headquartered in Chandler, Arizona, Everspin owns and operates a manufacturing line for its magnetic back-end-of-line wafer processing, using standard CMOS wafers from foundries. Everspin's current MRAM products are based on 180-nm, 130-nm, 40-nm, and 28-nm process technology nodes and industry standard packages.  Products  = Toggle MRAM = Toggle MRAM memory utilizes the magnetism of electron spin, enabling the storage of data without volatility or wear-out. Toggle MRAM utilizes a single transistor and a single MTJ cell in order to provide a durable, high-density memory. Because of the non-volatility of Toggle MRAM, data that is held in this memory is accessible for 20 years, at temperature (from -40c to 150c). The MTJ is composed of a fixed magnetic layer, a thin dielectric tunnel barrier, and a free magnetic layer. When a bias is applied to the Spin Toggle's MTJ, electrons that are spin polarized by the magnetic layers \\"tunnel\\" across the dielectric barrier. The MTJ device has a low resistance when the magnetic moment of the free layer is parallel to the fixed layer and a high resistance when the free layer moment is oriented anti- parallel to the fixed layer moment. Production densities include 128Kb to 16Mb; available in Parallel https://www.everspin.com/parallel-interface- mramand SPI interfaceshttps://www.everspin.com/serial-peripheral-interface; DFN, SOIC, BGA, and TSOP2 packages = Spin-transfer torque MRAM = Spin- transfer torque is a type of MRAM memory (STT-MRAM) built with a perpendicular MTJ that uses the spin-transfer torque property (the manipulation of the spin of electrons with a polarizing current) to manipulate the magnetic state of the free layer to program, or write, the bits in the memory array. Everspin's Perpendicular MTJ stack designs with high perpendicular magnetic anisotropy bring long data retention, small cell size, high density, high endurance, and low power. STT-MRAM has lower switching energy compared to Toggle MRAM, and can reach higher densities. STT-MRAM products from Everspin are compatible with JEDEC standard interfaces for DDR3 and DDR4 (with some modifications needed for MRAM technology). In this mode, the DDR3 product can act like a persistent (non-volatile) DRAM and require no refresh,Everspin EMD3D256M08BS1/EMD3D256M16BS1 datasheet. while the DDR4 product has self- refresh mode under idle state conditions.Everspin EMD4E001GAS2 datasheet. The DDR4 compatible STT-MRAM devices, with a 1Gb density, began early sampling to customers in early August 2017.. In June 2019, the 1Gb STT-MRAM entered pilot production. https://investor.everspin.com/news-releases/news-release- details/everspin-enters-pilot-production-phase-worlds-first-28-nm-1-gb = nvNITRO Storage Accelerators = Everspin developed nvNITRO products to address storage requirements that are typically being served by NVMe products. There are two different form factors, HHHL (PCIe Gen3 x8), and U.2. These devices can store up to 1GB in data today, with greater capacities planned as MRAM densities scale up over time. nvNITRO products can handle both NVMe 1.1 and block storage requirements. Because these products are built on MRAM, they do not require the battery backup of typical magnetic storage products in order to protect data in flight. Everspin officially launched the first version of the nvNITRO in August 2017, based on 256Mb ST-MRAM (1GB and 2GB capacities). Future versions will be based on the upcoming 1Gb ST-MRAM densities which recently began sampling to customers. SMART Modular Technologies has signed up as an nvNITRO technology partner and will sell nvNITRO storage accelerators under their brand name. = Embedded MRAM = Everspin has partnered with GlobalFoundries to integrate MRAM into standard CMOS technology, enabling it to be integrated, non-destructively, into CMOS logic designs. The embedded MRAM can replace embedded flash, DRAM or SRAM in any CMOS design, delivering similar capacities of memory with non-volatility. Embedded MRAM can be integrated into 65 nm, 40 nm, 28 nm and now in GlobalFoundries 22FDX process which is 22 nm and utilizes fully depleted silicon-on-insulator (FD-SOI).

It was similar to the Byzantine court offices of domestikos and cup-bearer (pinkernes, known in Serbian as peharnik). It had a role in the ceremony at the royal table, though the holder could be entrusted with jobs that had nothing to do with court ritual. According to studies of Rade Mihaljƒçiƒá, the holder was in charge of acquiring, preparing and serving food at the royal table. It was a confidant duty, given to the highest and most notable nobility, in which the ruler relied on in all occasions. Its oldest mention is from the court of King Stefan Milutin (r. 1282‚Äì1321), when ƒêura≈° Vranƒçiƒá had the title. The title of stavilac ranked as the last in the hierarchy of the Serbian court, behind ƒçelnik, kaznac, tepƒçija and vojvoda, the supreme title.

She was forced to commit suicide after it was discovered that she had cohabited with a slave after being widowed.Veritable Records of Seongjong, volume 225.  Life  Yi Guji was a daughter of Prince Yangnyeong, first son of the third Joseon king, Taejong of Joseon. Her mother was a palace slave with whom Yangnyeong had two children, but her name has not been recorded. Yi was given the title of Princess () and married Kwon Deok-young (), a lesser official, and went to live in Gwangju, her husband's hometown. They had two sons. Kwon died in 1470 and Yi was prevented from remarrying by social stigma, then by the issuing of the Anti-Remarriage Law of 1477. Investigation In 1475, it was reported to the Saheonbu that Yi had been cohabiting with her slave. Yi's nephew, Hak Rimjeong () requested that the situation be investigated without resorting to interrogation. He proposed that Cheonrye be moved to his residence, where the man could be questioned.Veritable Records of Seongjong, volume 62 One official reported that his son travelling from Gwangju had heard rumours of an aristocratic lady who was liaising with a slave, while another official said that his servant had observed Cheonrye sleeping and eating in the room next to his mistress' bedchamber. Seongjong, however, refused to arrest Yi based on gossip alone. This caused much dispute amongst officials on the policy of 'arresting regardless of suspicion', which some argued should apply only to common people and not the private affairs of an aristocratic lady. In 1489, the Saheonbu reported that Yi Guji had mothered a daughter by her slave, who had married the previous year.

In its early form, the holder was entrusted with the security of property belonging to the Orthodox Church from the aristocrats (compare Catholic Vidame), so the holder appeared in the role of a judge or executor of the ruler's decisions, in disputes between the church and the nobility. At the beginning of the 15th century, during the Serbian Despotate, the title of veliki ƒçelnik (–≤–µ–ª–∏–∫–∏ —á–µ–ª–Ω–∏–∫, \\"grand ƒçelnik\\") was the equivalent of count palatine and was the highest court title, with the title-holders holding great provinces, property and honours.  History  During the reign of King Stefan Milutin (r. 1282‚Äì1321), the title holder was entrusted with the security of property belonging to the Church from the aristocrats, so the holder appeared in the role of a judge or executor of the ruler's decisions, in disputes between the church and the nobility. At that time the title of ƒçelnik was of a higher rank than stavilac, but lower than kaznac and tepƒçija, with vojvoda being the supreme title. It is unclear if there was one or several with that title at the court at that time. During King Stefan Deƒçanski's reign there were two or three title holders at the same time. During Stefan Du≈°an's reign, the title of veliki ƒçelnik is first mentioned. The veliki ƒçelnik supervised over several ƒçelniks, each ƒçelnik being a commander of military fortifications (and presumably its troops) or a senior (stare≈°ina) of a larger number of villages. After Jovan Oliver and Dimitrije, it seems that the title was not given at the court of Stefan Du≈°an. During the service of Branilo (fl. 1347) and ƒêurica (fl. 1350), there is also a mention of Andronik, a ƒçelnik in Polog, though he likely was not of the same category as the former two. = List of known ƒçelniks = *Gradislav Voj≈°iƒá (fl. 1284‚Äì1327), served Stefan Milutin (fl. 1284). *Branko (fl. 1306‚Äì19), served Stefan Milutin (fl. 1305‚Äì06). *ƒêura≈° Ilijiƒá (fl. 1326‚Äì1362), served Stefan Deƒçanski (fl. 1326). *Gradislav Voj≈°iƒá (fl. 1284‚Äì1327), served Stefan Deƒçanski (fl. 1327). *Vukdrag (d. 1327), served Stefan Deƒçanski. *Branilo, served Stefan Du≈°an (fl. 1347). *ƒêurica, served Stefan Du≈°an (fl. 1350). *Andronik, served Stefan Du≈°an (fl. 1350). *Stanislav, served the Dejanoviƒá (fl. 1377). *Musa, served Uro≈° V *Vuk, ƒçelnik, served Stefan Lazareviƒá (fl. 1402) *ƒêuraƒë Golemoviƒá (fl. 1453), ƒçelnik, served ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá. *Milo≈°, *Milo≈° Poviƒá (fl. 1370) *Smil  Veliki ƒçelnik  At the beginning of the 15th century, during the Serbian Despotate, the title of veliki ƒçelnik was the equivalent of count palatine and was the highest court title, with the title-holders holding great provinces, property and honours.

The episode is written by Bryan Cogman and directed by Alik Sakharov, who worked previously as the director of photography on four season one episodes. The plot continues events built up in previous episodes: the aftermath of Jon Snow's investigation into Craster, Catelyn Stark's journey to the Stormlands in order to ask for Renly Baratheon's assistance in fighting the Lannisters, Theon's internal conflict as to where his allegiance lies, Tyrion Lannister uses his cunning to find his sister's spy within the Small Council, and Arya is consoled by Yoren before being confronted by soldiers looking for Gendry. The episode's title is taken from a prayer used on the Iron Islands, by worshippers of the Drowned God. Plot =In King's Landing= Dining with her children and Sansa, Cersei discusses the war and Sansa's betrothal to Joffrey. Afterward, Sansa is greeted by Shae, posing as her new handmaiden. Tyrion separately shares plans with Grand Maester Pycelle, Varys, and Petyr Baelish, to marry Myrcella off, but suggests a different husband to each of them. Cersei confronts Tyrion over the plan Tyrion gave to Pycelle, confirming Pycelle is her spy. Tyrion sends him to the dungeons, but not before Pycelle confesses that he told Cersei that Jon Arryn knew of her incest with Jaime. Tyrion convinces Baelish to meet Catelyn Stark in the Stormlands and persuade her to release Jaime. =Beyond the Wall= Craster returns with Jon Snow and orders the Night's Watch off his lands. Lord Commander Jeor Mormont admits to Jon that he already knew of Craster's sacrifice of his sons, but argues that Craster is indispensable to the Night's Watch's campaign. Samwell Tarly promises to come back for Gilly when the Night's Watch returns to the Wall. =At Winterfell= Bran Stark dreams again that he is his direwolf, Summer. Maester Luwin assures him the time of magic and dragons is over. =In the Reach= Catelyn arrives at self-crowned King Renly Baratheon's camp, where he and his new wife Margaery Tyrell watch imposing female warrior Brienne of Tarth win a tournament against Margaery's brother Loras. Renly grants Brienne a place in his Kingsguard, and is confident his army can defeat the Lannisters, but Catelyn reminds him his men are inexperienced. When Renly is unable to consummate their marriage, Margaery reveals she knows of his relationship with Loras, but insists her pregnancy must secure their families‚Äô alliance. =On the Iron Islands= Balon Greyjoy plans war on the North with Yara, who tells Theon he must choose between the Starks or the Greyjoys. Theon considers warning Robb Stark, but decides to serve under his father. =In the Riverlands= Yoren tells Arya Stark how he joined the Night's Watch. Lannister men led by Ser Amory Lorch arrive and demand Gendry, and the ensuing battle leaves the Night's Watch men dead. Arya rescues the prisoners, including Jaqen H'ghar, and loses her sword Needle to a Lannister soldier, Polliver. Lorch orders the survivors taken to Harrenhal, and Pollivar kills wounded Lommy Greenhands. Lorch demands the survivors point out Gendry, but before he can give himself up, Arya tells Lorch that Lommy was Gendry. Production =Writing= \\"What Is Dead May Never Die\\" was written by the story editor Bryan Cogman, based on George R. R. Martin's original book A Clash of Kings. Cogman, who is responsible for keeping the show's bible and had already written the first season's fourth episode, was on set for the filming of all the scenes of his episode. The chapters of the book included in the episode are Arya IV, Tyrion IV, Arya V, Catelyn II, Tyrion VI, Bran IV, (chapters 15, 18, 20, 23, 26 and 29) and also the parts of Tyrion I, Tyrion II, Tyrion V, Jon III and Theon II that had not been included in the previous episode (4, 9, 21, 24 and 25). The scenes set in the Iron Islands were created specifically for the show, as the books jump directly from Balon's revelation that he intends to attack the North to Theon overseeing the preparations of the attack. To flesh out the transition and flesh out Theon's feelings on his change of loyalties, Bryan Cogman included a scene of Theon writing a letter to Robb only to burn it afterwards, and the ritual baptism on the shores of Pyke. Cogman noted that, while those scenes have nearly no dialogue, they are the ones he's most proud of in his episode. Another scene created for the show was the dinner between Cersei and the children. The scene was included to remind the audience who Myrcella was, since her potential marriages were discussed in the episode. Aimee Richardson, the actor playing Myrcella (who has appeared in many past episodes as a background character), sent a note to Cogman thanking him for her \\"lines\\" in this scene. The final scene also had to be redesigned in relation to the books, due to the constraints imposed by the location, the schedule, and the time restrictions for the child actors. Cogman's first draft was more similar to the books, with Arya, Gendry, Lommy, and Hot Pie first fleeing and then being captured, but finally it was decided to combine both scenes. Cogman was also dismayed that he had to cut one of his favourite scenes in the books: Arya and Hot Pie charging while shouting the battle cries \\"Winterfell\\" and \\"Hot Pie.\\" In the audio commentary for this episode, included on the DVD and Blu-ray editions of Season 2, Cogman revealed that his initial script was over three hours long and had to be cut significantly (for example, Cogman mentioned that before the cuts he had included a long, drawn out fight scene between Jon and Craster, which was changed at the suggestion of director Alik Sakharov to a shot of Craster dragging Jon back to his keep). Cogman revealed that the sequences between Tyrion and Pycelle, Varys, Littlefinger, and Cersei were among his favorites. =Casting= This episode marks the first appearance of two new characters: Lady Margaery Tyrell, the new queen of King Renly Baratheon and sister of his lover, Loras Tyrell; and Brienne of Tarth, a member of Renly's guard. Natalie Dormer was cast as Margaery; her character was aged in relation to the book's counterpart (Dormer was 29 during the filming of season 2, while the Margaery from the books was 15), and her role was significantly expanded from a background, though important, character in the novels to a main character in the show. Dormer was also added to the series' main cast. Margaery is the youngest member of the Tyrell family in the novels, but as Dormer is six years older than Finn Jones, who plays Loras, Margaery is older than Loras in the show. For the role of Brienne the producers chose the English actress Gwendoline Christie. According to the character's creator George R. R. Martin, when he saw the first batch of auditions he saw \\"a dozen actresses who were reading for Brienne and one actress who was Brienne,\\" and it was one of the cases when there wasn't any debate. Due to her outstanding height (6 ft 3 in, 1.91 m) she was earmarked early on by fans of the books as a good fit for the character, and one of them even emailed her agent. Christie already knew about the role and felt that she could relate to the character after having been bullied for her height and androgynous looks. After deciding to \\"go all out for it,\\" she read the books, started building up with cardio-vascular exercises and kickboxing practices, and even started to wear unisex clothing in order to increase her own masculinity. After she had been cast, she continued to train and received extensive sword fighting and horse-riding lessons. Her last step in the process of transformation was cutting off her long hair, which she found deeply upsetting because she felt it was her last bond to her old self. The day after her hair was cut off, she went to her hotel room and cried. =Filming locations= Renly's camp was built at the Larrybane Bay. To reproduce Renly's camp, the production built a set at Larrybane chalk quarry beside Carrick-a-Rede. On September 12, 2011, while filming was taking place in Renly's camp, the high winds caused by Hurricane Katia destroyed a steel-framed marquee and five extras received minor injuries. Furthermore, the extreme weather conditions made some of the footage unusable, and they had to rebuild the set in October to reshoot some scenes. Among the scenes that had to be repeated there was the duel between Brienne and Loras and Catelyn's arrival. In the audio commentary for the episode, Bryan Cogman revealed that only 200 extras were used in scenes in Renly's camp, though there appeared to be many more. Reception =Ratings= The viewership of the episode consolidated the ratings obtained in the second season, matching the previous week's 3.8 million viewers in the first run of the night and reaching a total of 4.5 million with the two airings. In the United Kingdom, the episode was seen by 0.815 million viewers on Sky Atlantic, being the channel's highest-rated broadcast that week. =Critical reception= The episode received critical acclaim; review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes surveyed 14 reviews of the episode and judged 100% of them to be positive with an average score of 8.5 out of 10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Superbly written and directed, 'What is Dead May Never Die' evokes a range of emotions as uneasy alliances are forged, past traumas are explored, and the stakes grow ever higher.\\" Matt Fowler of IGN rated the episode 8.5 out of 10. The A.V. Club gave it an A-.
