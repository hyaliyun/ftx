The Frank‚ÄìStarling law of the heart is named after him and Ernest Starling. Family and early life (Friedrich Wilhelm Ferdinand) Otto Frank was born in Gro√ü-Umstadt and was the son of Georg Frank (1838‚Äì1907), a doctor of medicine and a practicing physician, and Mathilde Lindenborn (1841‚Äì1906). Otto Frank was married to Theres Schuster in a Catholic wedding in M√ºnchen .Katner, Wilhelm, ‚ÄûFrank, Friedrich Wilhelm Ferdinand Otto‚Äú, in: Neue Deutsche Biographie 5 (1961), S. 335 f. Training and Work Otto Frank studied medicine in M√ºnchen and Kiel between 1884 and 1889 (approbation in M√ºnchen 1889). During 1889 to 1891 he undertook training in mathematics, chemistry, physics, anatomy and zoology in Heidelberg, Glasgow, M√ºnchen and Stra√üburg. He then worked until 1894 as an assistant to Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Ludwig in the Physiologisches Institut in Leipzig. There in 1892 he completed his doctoral studies (Promotion). Subsequently, from 1894 Frank worked as an assistant in Carl von Voit's Physiological Institute in M√ºnchen where he studied cardiac function using approaches derived from earlier thermodynamic analyses of skeletal muscle contraction. His work on the behaviour of heart muscle was the topic of his post doctoral work. In 1902 he became an Extraordinary Professor and from 1905 to 1908 he undertook further work on this topic before becoming a full professor (Ordinariat). Then he returned to M√ºnchen to continue this work. Carl J. Wiggers visited Frank‚Äôs laboratory in 1912 and found Frank a ‚Äò‚Äòbrilliant analyst, a skillful systematist, a talented mathematician, and a creative thinker...‚Äô‚Äô, but secretive and difficult to work with. Wiggers returned to the US in the fall of 1912 having ‚Äòsmuggled‚Äô copies of some of Frank‚Äôs equipment out with him, despite this Wiggers and Frank seem to have maintained cordial relations subsequently. Frank appears to have been a demanding teacher and Richard Bing, an Editor of the Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology, who studied with Frank, recalled him as '...a holy terror, hating mediocrity, and many a student bit the dust in the examination in Physiology'. Frank continued to work in M√ºnchen until his enforced retirement in 1934 due to his opposition to the Nazi regime. Achievements Frank's initial research was related to fat absorption. But in his postdoctoral work (Habilitationsschrift) Frank investigated the isometric and isotonic contractile behaviour of the heart and it is this work that he is best known for. Frank's work on this topic preceded that of Ernest Starling, but both are usually credited with providing the foundations of what is termed the Frank‚ÄìStarling law of the heart. This law states that \\"Within physiological limits, the force of contraction is directly proportional to the initial length of the muscle fiber\\". Frank also undertook important work into the physiological basis of the arterial pulse waveform and may have coined the term essential hypertension in 1911. His work on the Windkessel extended the original ideas of Stephen Hales and provided a sound mathematical framework for this approach. Frank also published on waves in the arterial system but his attempts to produce a theory that incorporated waves and the Windkessel are not considered to have been successful. Frank also did work on the oscillatory characteristics of the auditory apparatus of the ear and the thermodynamics of muscle. He also worked extensively on developing accurate methods to measure blood pressure and other physiological phenomena (e.g. Frank's capsule (Frank-Kapsel), optical Spiegelsphygmograph).

What could be considered the hub of the community is a small collection of business that includes the Malahat Gas station (which also serves as the Malahat Post Office) and the Malahat Chalet and the Moon Water Lodge. A steep and rugged terrain has in the past precluded any significant residential development but new subdivisions are being built around the northern end of the area around the old Bamberton cement works and in the area adjoining Elkington Forest. Most area residents live in isolated homes located off the highway. In this context \\"Malahat\\" primarily refers to the Canada Post delivery district. Malahat is mostly known for the portion of British Columbia Highway 1 that traverses the community, locally known as 'The Malahat' or 'The Malahat Drive'. The roadway has a mix of 2, 3 and 4 lane cross-sections. The highway through the narrow Goldstream Park canyon section is 2 lanes. The Malahat portion of highway 1 has been subject to a number of fatal traffic accidents ‚Äì caused largely by vehicles crossing the centre line. These accidents have led to lengthy road closures. Closure of the Malahat highway causes disruption to travel and commerce on Vancouver Island as portions of the highway are a single point of failure if closed and there are no practical alternative routes. As a result of these crashes the Ministry of Transportation has begun a program to add centre concrete medians to separate north and southbound traffic. Now the section between Finlayson Arm Road to Summit has had median added; 65% of the Malahat highway is divided with a concrete median.

It is somewhat based on a similar programme airing on its sister Canal+ network in France, Les Guignols de l'info, in that it features latex puppets. Latex casts may be shared among countries with local celebrities being used as anonymous citizens in foreign shows. It was initially hosted by the puppets of Marta Reyero and Hilario Pino, the real hosts of the channel daily news. Later, its host was a facsimile of Michael Robinson, an English-born football pundit; and in the final seasons it was conducted by the puppet of Iker Jim√©nez (a presenter of the channel). While Pen√©lope Cruz has made some appearances, the program generally focuses on prominent athletes and political figures. Among other figures, the program features Pau Gasol, Ra√∫l, Luis Aragon√©s, Florentino P√©rez, Joan Laporta, Fernando Alonso, Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero, Mariano Rajoy, Mar√≠a Teresa Fern√°ndez de la Vega, Jos√© Bono, Pasqual Maragall, and Josep-Llu√≠s Carod-Rovira. International figures who regularly appear include David Beckham, Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, Samuel Eto'o, Louis van Gaal (who instead of a head has a cube made of bricks, probably an allusion to his well-known stubbornness) George W. Bush, Condoleezza Rice, Tony Blair, Silvio Berlusconi and Pope Benedict XVI. Historically, prominent characters have included Felipe Gonz√°lez (occasionally appearing as Cantinflas), Jos√© Mar√≠a Aznar and Jordi Pujol. One of the most often quoted phrases attributed to former prime minister Jos√© Mar√≠a Aznar - \\"¬°Espa√±a va bien!\\" (literally \\"Spain is doing well\\"). While most programmes on Canal+ were scrambled for non set-top box subscribers, Las noticias del gui√±ol was broadcast unscrambled. In November 2005 Canal+ ceased to exist as a partially encrypted terrestrial television channel (although it continued to exist on the Digital+ satellite platform). It was replaced by Spain's fifth national terrestrial channel Cuatro, the newest member of Jes√∫s de Polanco's Sogecable media empire. Although the gui√±oles were one of the very few programmes to make the transition from Canal+ to Digital+, the programme was rebranded for the new channel as Los gui√±oles de Canal+. The programme started being shown on the free-to-air channel Cuatro. Since 2006, they were included as a section in the late-night show \\"Noche Hache\\". Its production ceased at the same time as that show, in July 2008. The programme has won \\"Premio Ondas\\", the most prestigious TV prize in Spain to the scriptwriters Fidel Nogal and Gonzalo Tegel.

It has been in use since 15 July 1963. Official description The government of Gabon describes the coat of arms as follows:Symboles nationaux - Presidence de la Republique Gabonaise Or, a ship sable, masts of the same, with the flag of Gabon, tierced in fess vert, or and azure, sailing upon a sea azure; a chief vert charged with three bezants. Only the blazon of the escutcheon is mentioned by the government. Other elements are mentioned, but not as a part of the blazon. The supporters are \\"two black panthers\\", and the compartment is an Aucoumea klaineana. The motto is \\"UNION, TRAVAIL, JUSTICE\\" in capital letters or on a field azure, and the slogan \\"UNITI PROGREDIEMUR\\" in capital letters sable. Symbolism The supporters of the symbol are panthers which symbolize the vigilance and courage of the president who protects the nation. The bezants (golden discs) in chief of the shield symbolize the mineral wealth of the country. The ship at the lower part represents Gabon moving towards a brighter future. According to Briggs, \\"green represents the great dense forests; yellow, the sun; blue, the sea; and black, the people of Africa\\". The okoum√© tree at the top of the shield symbolizes the timber trade. The coat of arms is unusual in having two ribbons with mottos in two different languages. The ribbon below the shield has a motto in French 'UNION, TRAVAIL, JUSTICE' ('Unity, Work, Justice'). The second ribbon is placed beneath the branches of the okoum√© tree and has a motto in Latin 'UNITI PROGREDIEMUR' ('We shall go forward united').

It is south of Armagh and near the border with the Republic of Ireland. It is situated mainly in the historic barony of Armagh with six townlands in the barony of Tiranny. It had a population of 3,036 people in the 2011 Census. A tributary of the River Callan, known as the Clea, flows from its source in Clea Lake (also spelled as Clay Lake) through the middle of the village. The River Clea once powered Keady's millwheels. In the middle of the village, on the banks of the river, stands the Old Mill, which has been converted into workshops and offices. History The name Keady is recorded as long ago as 1674 in a letter from Symore Richardson to the Provost of Trinity College, Dublin (the district was part of a grant of County Armagh lands to that college). However, the village did not emerge as an important centre until the mid 18th century when the use of waterpower led to the growth of great linen mills and factories. By 1837, Keady was noted as being the centre of an important flourishing linen trade by Samuel Lewis in his Topographical Dictionary of Ireland. The Keady Monument was erected by the local people to honour William Kirk, (a member of Second Keady Presbyterian Church), who through his mills at Keady and Darkley, provided so much economic prosperity in the area. The village also became a centre of tailoring before the First World War, and the arrival of the railway brought the town great commercial benefit, although the lines for both goods and passenger traffic have since closed. Until recently, Keady retained its links with clothing manufacture, with a major textiles firm employing many local people; this has since closed. Situated on the River Clea (which flows from Clea Lake to the River Callan), Keady is noted chiefly for the 'Keady Trout Lakes'. It is also of interest to the industrial archeologist as the centre of a district with many derelict watermills. Tassagh Glen, just outside the village, has a mill and viaduct of great size. The newly restored mill in the middle of Keady offers the visitor a glimpse into Keady's industrial past. =The Troubles= For more information see The Troubles in Keady, which includes a list of incidents in Keady during the Troubles resulting in two or more deaths. Transport *The railway arrived in Keady in 1909, with the opening of the Castleblayney, Keady and Armagh Railway line from Armagh, which was extended to Castleblayney in 1910. Keady railway station opened on 31 May 1909, closed for passenger traffic on 1 February 1932 and finally closed altogether on 1 October 1957. As a cross border line, when the Irish Free State was created in 1922, it lost all passenger traffic in 1923, with freight being withdrawn from the cross border section from Castleblayney to Keady in 1924. The Armagh to Keady freight service was withdrawn on 1 October 1957. *There is a railway viaduct in Keady as well as one of the more interesting artifacts of Irish railway history, the tunnel for the Ulster and Connaught Light Railway. This was a proposal for a narrow gauge line from Greenore, County Louth to Clifden, County Galway, for which the tunnel under the railway embankment at Keady was built, but never used. Ulsterbus now use part of the tunnel as a bus garage. Sport Gaelic games have been popular in Keady since the 19th century. The local Gaelic football club, founded in 1888, is Keady Michael Dwyer's GFC. The hurling club, founded in 1949, is Keady L√°mh Dhearg; prior to 1949 the Dwyer's club also fielded hurling teams, as did the defunct √âire √ìg club in the 1920s and early '30s.

Vibudh Shridhar is the first known Agrawal author.Parmananda Jain Shastri, Agrawalon ka Jain Sanskriti men yogadan, Anekanta Oct. 1966, p. 277‚Äì281 His Pasanah Chariu provides the first reference to the Agrawal community and the first historical reference to the legend of the origin of the name Dilli for Delhi.An Early Attestation of the Toponym ·∏åhillƒ´, by Richard J.

Tughlaq period Delhi was the location where the Digambara Bhattaraka institution was initiated according to some authors. Bha·π≠·π≠ƒÅraka Prabhachandra, who was the disciple of Bha·π≠·π≠ƒÅraka Ratnakirti of Ajmer, visited Delhi at the invitation of the lay Jains there. He visited the Muslim ruler Firuz Shah Tughluq, who had a Jain minister named Chand Shah. At Ferozshah's request, he visited his inner courtyard. Until that time, Prabhachandra used to be without clothes, but at Chand Sah's request, he wore a loincloth.

Tughluq. Prabhachandra's disciples Dhanapal and Bramha Nathuram has described his visit to Delhi. Bahubali Charit states that in a great festival Ratnakirti anointed Prabhachandra. Muhammad had the pleasure of listening to Prabhachandra, who had defeated other scholars in disputations: ‡§§‡§π‡§ø‡§Ç ‡§≠‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§π‡§ø‡§Ç ‡§∏‡•Å‡§Æ‡§π‡•ã‡§ö‡•ç‡§õ‡§µ ‡§µ‡§ø‡§π‡§ø‡§Ø‡§â, ‡§∏‡§ø‡§∞‡§ø‡§∞‡§Ø‡§£‡§ï‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§ø ‡§™‡§ü‡•ç‡§ü‡•á‡§£‡§ø‡§π‡§ø‡§Ø‡§â  ‡§Æ‡§π‡§Æ‡§Ç‡§¶ ‡§∏‡§æ‡§π‡§ø‡§Æ‡§£‡•Å‡§∞‡§Ç‡§ú‡§ø‡§â,‡§µ‡§ø‡§ú‡•ç‡§ú‡§π‡§ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§á‡§Ø‡§Æ‡§£‡•Å‡§≠‡§Ç‡§ú‡§ø‡§â  Prabhachandra was thus the first Bhattaraka of Delhi in 1385 CE when the Prashati of the Bhattrakas of Shravanabelagola is recited, other Bhattaraka seats are mentioned, the first among them being Yoginipur (Delhi). All the Bhattarakas of North India belonging to the Balatkara Gana of Mula Sangh belong to the lineage established by Bha·π≠·π≠ƒÅraka Padmanadi, the successor of PrabhƒÅcandra. The Bha·π≠·π≠ƒÅraka tradition in Delhi survived until the British rule, and the Shri Parsvanath Jain Mandir temple in Subji mandi is still known as the Bha·π≠·π≠ƒÅraka Temple. =Jinaprabh Suri and Vividha Tirtha Kalpa= Jinaprabh Suri, who had wandered over a large part of India and written an account of various tirthas during Samvat 1364‚Äì1389, lived in Delhi during the rule of b.

Shahjahan moved his capital to Delhi after building the walled city of Delhi called Shahjahanabad. Several Jain, such as Sahu Todar served as the imperial treasurers during the Mughal rule. A part of Shahjahanabad was allocated to the Jains on the south side of the Chandni Chowk canal, close to the imperial residence (qila-mubarak, now known as the Red Fort). The Jains were permitted to have a temple during 1658 in Urdu Bazar, which was called the Urdu Mandir (now Lal Mandir), provided it did not look like a temple. Raja Harsukh Rai in the early 19th century was the chief of the Agrawal Jain community, and a builder of several Jain temples in and around Delhi including the Naya Mandir, was the imperial treasurer during Sam. 1852-Sam. 1880. Naya Mandir was the first Delhi temple to have a shikhara. Modern period Delhi has 148 Digambara temples, mostly in the walled city areas, 61 Sthanakvasi Upashrayas and 16 Svetambara Murtipujak temples. In modern Delhi, the majority of Jains in Jain Colony (Veer Nagar), nearby Roopnagar area are refugees from Punjab in Pakistan who arrived after the partition of India.The M≈´rtip≈´jaka ≈övetƒÅmbara Community in North Delhi, Akiko Shimizu, Centre of Jaina Studies Newsletter, Issue 3: February 2008, page 28  Main temples  Atma Vallabha Sanskriti mandir DƒÅdƒÅbadƒ´, Mehrauli Worship in Jambudweep ; Digambara Jain Lal Mandir The oldest Jain temple in Delhi known as Lal Mandir (\\"Red Temple\\"). It is just opposite of the Red Fort on the Netaji Subhas Marg, Chandni Chowk, Delhi. Constructed in 1658, the temple has undergone many modifications, additions, and alterations. The temple has a free bird hospital (though donations are appreciated) in the courtyard. It practices the Jain principle that all life is sacred. ; Shri Atma Vallabh Jain Smarak Located at 20th kilometer on G. T. Karnal Road, its idyllic setting bring out the elegance of the buildings, which were all built according to traditional Jain Shastras. The complex includes Shri Vasupujaya Temple, Shri Vallabh Smarak, a Shastra Bhandar, a Jain Museum, and a Research Centre for Indology. The complex also has a school for children, a Dharamshala & Bhojanalaya for the convenience of visitors, as well as a free dispensary. The complex also contains \\"Devi Padamavati Temple\\" and a shrine of Sadhvi Mrigavati ji. ; Naya Mandir This was the first temple in Delhi with a shikhar. Raja Harsukh Rai, imperial treasurer in the late Mughal period, constructed this large and ornate Jain temple in the Dharampura locality of Old Delhi in 1807 during the rule of Mughal Emperor Akbar II with a cost of about 8 Lakh rupees, then an enormous amount. He was able to obtain the royal permission to construct a shikhara for the temple for the first time during the Mughal rule. This temple is known as the Naya Mandir (new temple), since an older Jain temple, now known as the Lal Mandir already existed. ; Ahinsa Sthal Ahinsa Sthal is a Jain temple located in Mehrauli, Delhi. A magnificent monolithic statue of Tirthankara MahƒÅvƒ´ra in lotus position weighing around 30 tonnes is installed here. The temple complex also consist of a large garden. ; DƒÅdƒÅbadƒ´, Mehrauli The dƒÅdƒÅbadƒ´ in Delhi, is the place where DƒÅdƒÅ Guru Jinachandra S≈´ri was cremated. According to the legend, while on his deathbed, he told his followers that when he died the \\"Mani\\" (magic jewel) embedded in his forehead would fall out and should be placed in a bowl of milk. He also instructed them that his body should not be kept anywhere while preparing for the funeral. Everyone was so sad, however, that they forgot his instructions and set his body on the ground. When they tried to move it again, it wouldn't budge. Even elephants were used, but all attempts failed and the last rites had to be performed right there, at the spot where the shrine now stands. = Nearby Jain Tirthas = * Hastinapur * Tijara * Ahichatra

Biography Gar√ß√£o was born in Lisbon, Socorro, the son of Filipe Correia da Serra or Correia da Silva, born in S√£o Jo√£o do Souto, Braga, and baptized in 1697, a Nobleman of the Royal Household, Knight of the Order of Christ and Familiar of the Holy Office of the Portuguese Inquisition of Coimbra, who held an important post in the foreign office; his mother Lu√≠sa Maria da Visita√ß√£o Dorgier Gar√ß√£o de Carvalho, born in Lisbon, S√£o Jos√©, and baptized on 18 July 1699, was of French descent. The poet's health was frail, and after going through a Jesuit school in Lisbon and learning English, French and Italian at home, he proceeded in 1742 to the University of Coimbra with a view to a legal career. He took his degree in 1748, and two years later was created a Knight of the Order of Christ. In 1751 his marriage in Lisbon, Santa Justa, with Maria Ana Xavier Froes Mascarenhas de Sande Salema, born c. 1725, by whom he had one son, brought him a rich dowry which enabled him to live in ease and cultivate letters; but in later years a lawsuit reduced him to poverty. He managed, however, to become a Nobleman of the Royal Household like his father. From 1760 to 1762 he edited the Lisbon Gazette. In 1756, in conjunction with Cruz e Silva and others, Gar√ß√£o founded the Arc√°dia Lusitana to reform the prevailing bad taste in literature, identified with Seicentismo, which delighted in conceits, windy words and rhetorical phrases. The Arc√°dia fulfilled its mission to some extent, but it lacked creative power, became dogmatic, and ultimately died of inanition. Gar√ß√£o was the chief contributor to its proceedings, bearing the name of Corydon Erimantheo, and his orations and dissertations, with many of his lyrics, were pronounced and read at its meetings. He lived much in the society of the English residents in Lisbon, and he is supposed to have conceived a passion for an English married lady which completely absorbed him and contributed to his ruin. In the midst of his literary activity and growing fame, he was arrested on the night of April 9, 1771, and committed to prison by Pombal, whose displeasure he had incurred by his independence of character. The immediate cause of his incarceration would appear to have been his connection with a love intrigue between a young friend of his and the daughter of a Colonel Elsden, but he was never brought to trial, and the matter must remain in doubt. After much solicitation, his wife obtained from the king an order for her husband's release on November 10, 1772, but it came too late. Broken by infirmities and the hardships of prison life, Gar√ß√£o expired that very day in the Limoeiro, at the age of forty-eight. Works and style Taking Horace as his model, supported by his own background of scholarship and wide reading, Gar√ß√£o set out to raise and purify the standard of poetic taste. His verses are characterized by a classical simplicity of form and expression. His sonnets and sodales reveal his personality; his odes and epistles reveal an inspired poet and a man chastened by suffering. His two comedies in hendecasyllables, the Theatro Novo (played in January 1766) amid the Assemblea, are satires on the social life of the capital; and in the Cantata de Dido, included in the latter piece, the spirit of Greek art is allied to perfection of form, making this composition much- admired among Portuguese 18th century poetry. Gar√ß√£o wrote little and spent much time on the labor limae. His works were published posthumously in 1778, and the most complete and accessible edition is that of Ant√≥nio Jos√© Saraiva, Obras completas, 2 vols. (Lisbon, 1957‚Äì58; reprinted 1982). An English version of the Cantata de Dido appeared in the Academy (January 19, 1895).

Rising on the foot of the spur of Gargano, San Severo adjoins the communes of Apricena in the north, Rignano Garganico and San Marco in Lamis in the east, Foggia and Lucera in the south, and Torremaggiore and San Paolo di Civitate in the west. Geography =Territory= The city sits in low-lying country, its center being at is about above sea level. Geologically, its soil is quaternary (with sand and clay, fossils, and marine in origin). Its territory decreases in elevation from the west to the east , gradually changing from minor ripples in the western hills to a more regular plain in the east at the Candelaro basin. In addition to the Candelaro river, other waterways include the Triolo and Salsola torrents and Radicosa, Venola, Ferrante, Santa Maria and Potes channels. The scarcity of rain in the summer causes the groundwater to become brackish, especially in the subsoil of the city. The lands surrounding the city are studded with farms, characterized primarily by ordered groves and vineyards, as well as fields of wheat. =Climate= The climate is Mediterranean, with relatively cold winters (snow is rare) and very hot summers. High wind gusts are quite common.Fonte: Biopuglia . *Climate classification: Zone D, GR-G 1494. History =Origins= According to legend, a city called Castrum Drionis (Casteldrione) was founded by the Greek king Diomedes. San Severo is said to be one of the last towns in Italy to remain pagan, and only in 536 did Saint Laurence of Siponto, bishop of Siponto, convert the town's inhabitants to Christianity. He also required that the village be renamed after governor Severus. San Severo lies on the Daunia, and various Neolithic settlements have been detected. In the early Middle Ages, the area was not inhabited or defined. Between the Lombards and the Byzantine ages, the Benedictine monastery at Cassino was established, and with it, the cult of the apostle of Saint Severinus of Noricum. San Severo was founded in the 11th century around a small church built by the Benedictine monks from Montecassino. It rapidly developed as a trade town. In 1053, it was the scene of the historical victory of Robert Guiscard over the papal troops under Pope Leo IX (see Battle of Civitate). In the eleventh century, San Severo was the route of the Via Sacra Langobardorum and a primitive church arose dedicated to Saint Severino, from which continued an influx of pilgrims to Monte Sant'Angelo and movement of people and goods. The town was therefore called Castellum Sancti Severini (\\"Fortified Town of San Severo\\"). The conurbation developed rapidly due to its favorable position for trade, and soon took on considerable importance; it became the seat of Venetian, Florentine, Saracens and Jewish merchants. Subject to the abbots of the Benedictine monastery of San Pietro di Torremaggiore (in 1116 the abbot gave the famous Adenulfo Libertatis Charta), in 1230, the city rebelled against Frederick II of Hohenstaufen who ceded it to the Knights Templar. =Medieval= Medieval drawing of San Severo. After the suppression of the Templars, by 1312, the city was refortified with a wall, and ceded to Robert d'Anjou and his wife Sancha. In 1317, Sancha sold it to Count Peter Pippin, Lord of Vico. The resistance of the citizens denied him the possession of his acquisition, and resistance only stopped when they gained some degree of independence under the royal authority of Naples. San Severo was then declared a royal city in perpetuity.Cfr. Corteo storico Carlo V It became the capital of Giustizierato (province) of Capitanata, whose jurisdiction also included Molise. The city was the seat of provincial officials and the court of the Royal Audience. After Queen Joan I of Naples stayed there, many Neapolitan monarchs followed in her presence, including Alfonso I of Aragon and Ferdinand I of Naples. In the fifteenth century, the city also minted its own coins. =From Renaissance to Principality= In 1521, Charles V sold the city to the Duke of Termoli, Ferdinand of Capua, but Mayor Tiberio Solis was able to redeem it by paying 42,000 ducats to the Emperor by collecting contributions from private citizens. The king then granted the city of San Severo the perpetual right to self-government. According to tradition, in January 1536, Charles V also ennobled twenty-four local families, establishing the town's oligarchic regime. San Severo became the most populous city in Capitanata in the 16th century. The rich commerce, cultural vitality and self-government made it one of the major centers of the south, due to the presence of a large Venetian warehouse. Directly connected to the Fortore river was an important link between the Venetians and the Kingdom of Naples. Leandro Alberti (1550) writes of San Severo \\"this castle is very rich, noble, civilized and filled with people, and is so wealthy that he envied any other in this region.\\" The town also established ecclesiastical organizations, with four wealthy parishes, several hospitals, some religious confraternities and nine religious institutes. =The Age of the Principality= In 1579, at the height of its prestige but suffocated in debt, the city was sold to Duke Gian Francesco di Sangro, who won for his heirs the title of Prince of Sansevero. Consequently, it lost its rank as capital, which passed to Lucera, and the governor of the province and the court was transferred. Accustomed to self-government, the citizens chafed under the tyranny of their new feudal lords. Many families of the old Sanseveresi aristocracy immediately chose to leave the city and those who remained watched helplessly as the era known as the \\"Regime of Forty\\" unfolded. This was an era of decline for the city, despite the promotion of the city to Episcopal seat in 1580. On July 30, 1627, a catastrophic earthquake almost razed the town to the ground and killed eight hundred inhabitants and an unspecified number of foreigners. Reconstruction was slow, and hindered by the plague epidemic of 1656 and 1657 (during which nearly three thousand people died). In the eighteenth century, the city was rebuilt with a markedly Baroque appearance.Una minuziosa cronaca del terremoto √® contenuta nella coeva opera dello storiografo Antonio Lucchino ( Memorie della Citt√† di Sansevero e suoi avvenimenti per quanto si rileva negli anni prima del 1629 cit.) On April 16, 1797, Ferdinand IV visited San Severo and there he reviewed the Regina regiment. On April 25, Prince Francis I of the Two Sicilies and Queen Maria Carolina, came there to visit and attended a solemn mass in the cathedral. In February 1799, following a fierce reaction to the proclamation of the Jacobin republic, French troops, commanded by Generals Guillaume Philibert Duhesme and La Foret plundered the city with terrible violence. The victims, between citizens and soldiers, were about four hundred and fifty.Bicentenario dei moti rivoluzionari del 1799. Atti della Giornata di studio (San Severo, 3 dicembre 1999), San Severo, Archeoclub d'Italia, 2000. =19th Century= Feudalism was abolished in 1806 and San Severo was the sixth largest city of the kingdom by number of inhabitants. It became the capital of one of the three districts and then sub-prefecture. In 1819, the ancient palace Decurionate inaugurated in the Teatro Real de Bourbon, the first Italian district and one of the first in the south. After the French occupation, the city became a key stronghold of the Carbonari, so that Giuseppe Mazzini long dreamed of making San Severo the starting point of the riots of 1820. In 1826, the monumental cemetery was opened. On May 18, 1847, Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies visited the city. The large public gardens were dedicated in 1854, while in 1858, there was the dedication of the Ferdinandea Civic Library.Carmelo G. Severino, San Severo citt√† di Puglia, Roma, Gangemi Editore, 2007, p. 150. 150 In 1860, San Severo contributed many young people to increase the ranks of the anti Bourbon-militias, when Francis II was still on the throne, and was the among the first cities to proclaim allegiance to the Kingdom of Italy and to hoist the tricolor Flag of Italy. On October 21 the same year, the Sanseveresi voted unanimously for a united Italy. From 1862 to 1864, during the riots, the city was the seat of the 49th Regiment unit, who distinguished itself in the suppression. After the unit built the railway station in 1863, and created the high school and technical schools in 1864, they also started two major bands, the \\"White\\" in 1879 and \\"Red\\" in 1883, who obtained several international awards. =Modern= On April 29, 1923, the Crown Prince Umberto I of Italy visited the city and inaugurated the school building \\"Principe di Piemonte\\". In 1929, the municipal sports field was inaugurated. On October 27, 1931, the Minister of Communications, Costanzo Ciano, dedicated the Ferrovie del Gargano, linking the station of San Severo to a number of places on the Gargano-Peschici line. On December 9, 1937, the curtain of the new Municipal theater was opened for the first time. The San Severo Airfield in World War II During the Second World War, on September 9, 1943, a group of Italian soldiers were involved in an episode of resistance, refusing to surrender to the Germans. By September 28, the Germans blew up the telephone exchange, the Casillo mill and several bridges, including that of the railway. During World War II, San Severo was the home of a US Airfield for the Fifteenth Air Force. P-51 fighters of the 31st Fighter Brigade lead armed escorts and support operations from San Severo on April 2, 1944 to March 3, 1945. On March 23, 1950, San Severo workers rioted against police, raising barricades and storming the armory and the headquarters of the Italian Social Movement. The clashes caused one death and wounded forty civilians and soldiers and army tanks occupied the main streets of the city. In the following days, an armed insurrection was raised against the powers of the state; people were arrested, acquitted, and a year later released after the trial. Pope John Paul II visited the city on May 25, 1987. In 1996, by special decree, the President of the Republic, Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, confirmed for San Severo the title of city, historically acquired in 1580, and the establishment of the Sanseveresi diocese. In 1999, at the Italian Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, San Severo was presented two bills (respectively 6472 and 4370) for the establishment of the province of San Severo, comprising 22 municipalities in Tavoliere delle Puglie north of Gargano and Subappennino Dauno. Between October 31 and November 2, 2002, a violent earthquake, known as the Molise earthquake, damaged many buildings in the old village and caused the closure of some of its historic churches. Miracle of San Severino According to legend, the apparition of St Severino has appeared to the relief of his city on two occasions. In 1522, along with the apparition of St Sebastian, he appeared to warn about a looming army of mercenaries. Six years later, his apparition is credited with driving away the imperial army. During the War of Lautrec, San Severo was besieged and seized by the French general, who then promptly died. The town now feared retribution by the imperial army, who were at the walls. In order to avoid a long siege, the imperial soldiers feigned a withdrawal, intending to storm the town by surprise the next night. Legend holds that when the imperial troops returned the next night, before the walls of San Severo, they came upon a huge army under the command of a knight holding a bright sword in his right hand and a red flag in his left, and fled in fear. The next morning some people, unaware of the miracle, found some of the imperials asleep near the monastery of San Bernardino. The soldiers told the events of the night before, and the people agreed that their patron saint, San Severino, had personally defended them. The people then found that the altar cloth in the church had large hoofprints, a sign of their saintly defenders. On his feast day, each year, the town donates a hundred pounds of wax to the patron saint, proclaimed Defensor Patriae. From thence, the town's civic emblem is San Severino riding with a red flag in his right hand. Etymology The city derives its name from the patron saint San Severino, the owner of the church around which the castellum was formed. The original \\"Sanctus Severinus\\" appeared in seven papers written between 1116 and 1266. \\"Sanctus Severus\\", however, is first attested in a document dated 1134, also known only in dubious modern transcription.Cfr. Emanuele d'Angelo, San Severino, il Defensor Patriae, in San Severino Abate, patrono principale della citt√† e diocesi di San Severo. Nel centenario della conferma del patronato, 1908-2008, San Severo, Parrocchia San Severino Abate - Pia Associazione San Severino Abate, 2008, pp. 27-29. In some documents, the header is read in Latin with the original spelling and the one derived in the text in the vernacular; this suggests that the change is due to ancient agiotoponimo syncope, withdrawal common in the transition from Latin to Italian: Sanctus Severinus> Sanseverinus> Sansevero, especially since no saint named Severus was revered in the city before the end of the seventeenth century. Uncoincidentally, the official name \\"Sansevero\\" - acknowledging the uncommon variants San Severo and S. Severo - was always in the univerbata form. In 1931 the municipality, at the request of the Ministry of Interior, officially adopted the spelling \\"San Severo\\", having been taken from the dictionary compiled by the United Town's Central Institute of Statistics (The situation is analogous to that of Sanremo). The change of the name was accepted with little to no resistance, so that today it is used almost universally. An exception is made by Trenitalia and the Autostrade, which represents the city by writing \\"S. Severe\\". Main sights On February 2, 2006, the town received recognition as an art city. The center retains its medieval labyrinthine street grids, and was once delimited by a perimeter wall punctuated by seven gates. The medieval town suffered from the earthquake of July 30, 1627. It is rich in Baroque palaces (including those of de Petris, del Sordo, de Lucretiis, Fraccacreta, Mascia, Recca, de Ambrosio, Pozzo, and Summantico). It had a number of monasteries, including three Benedictine monasteries (now the seat of the Court), a Celestine monastery (which became the town hall in 1813) and a Franciscans monastery (now the seat of the Municipal Library and Museum). At the center of the town is the Romanesque church of San Severino, dedicated to the patron of the city. The cathedral, dedicated to Santa Maria Assunta, has undergone many reconstructions. The interior has a 12th-century baptismal font and paintings by eighteenth-century painters such as D'Elia, Primavera, and Solimena). The Church of San Giovanni Battista has paintings by Nicola Menzel. The cupola of the church of Santa Maria del Carmine was frescoed by Mario Borgoni. San Lorenzo's Church. The Teatro Comunale, dedicated to Verdi, is the largest theater building in Capitanata, premiered in 1937. It has a large public garden with century old avenues that converge on an artificial mound called Montagnella, and a platform with bronze statues and a large round stage for concerts. A number of small monuments are dispersed throughout the flower beds, including the marble bust (1837) of Matteo Tondi by Tito Angelini. After the earthquake of 1627 and the gradual removal of walls, the town expanded with the creation of new districts. To contain the damage caused by frequent earthquakes, most of the buildings do not exceed two floors (and often were reduced to low ground floors and whitewashed gable roofs). The expansion of the city continued into the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Dialect Because of its geographic location, San Severo has had direct contact for centuries with the dialects of Gargano, northern Apulia, Molise, and Campania. As a result, the Sanseverese dialect is overall very close to that of Naples. Among the various dialects of Apulia, it differs somewhat from that of nearby Foggia and has little relationship with that of the city of Bari.Notiziario storico- archeologico del Centro di studi sanseveresi del dicembre 1975 (p. 63) As an example, the sentence, \\"The dog bites the bottom,\\" in standard Italian would be \\"Il cane morde lo straccione,\\" whereas in Sanseverese it would be \\"U chen m√≤cc√´ch√´ 'u straccet,\\" and in the Foggian dialect it would be \\"U chen muccich√®j√´ 'u stracce.\\"Cfr. Attilio Littera - Ciro Pistillo, Grammatica del dialetto di San Severo, Apricena, Malatesta Editrice, 2006; Ciro Pistillo - Attilio Littera, Dizionario del dialetto di San Severo, Apricena, Malatesta Editrice, 2006. San Severo DOC The Italian wine DOC around San Severo produces red, white and rose wines, as well as the occasional sparkling spumante. Grapes are limited to a harvest yield of 14 tonnes/ha throughout the 2,000 ha (5000 acre) production zone. The red and rose wines are made from 70-100% Montepulciano with Sangiovese permitted by up to 30%. The white and spumante wines are produced with 40-60% Bombino bianco, 40-60% Trebbiano and up to 20% Verdeca.P. Saunders Wine Label Language pg 199 Firefly Books 2004 Events =Patronal feast= Procession of the Saints in San Severo San Severo is famous for its yearly festival held on the third Sunday of May. Called \\"La Festa del Soccorso\\" (The Festival of Help/Aid), it is held in honor of the patron saints of San Severo, \\"La Madonna del Soccorso\\" (The Madonna of Help/Aid), Saint Severinus Abbot, and Saint Severus Bishop. During this festival, San Severo features nighttime and daytime fireworks in order to celebrate the Madonna; the daytime fireworks are a major attraction. Extremely loud firecracker chains are placed along the city streets. In many cases they extend for kilometers. A common practice is for young males to run along the firecrackers as they explode down the street (an analogue tradition, called \\"Correfoc\\", exists in Spain). These people are called \\"fuejentes\\" (people who enjoy running through the fireworks). For this reason San Severo is called \\"the city of fireworks\\". =Rituals for Good Friday= Among the many traditions are the rites of the Holy Week. At dawn on Good Friday, a procession starts simultaneously from the three churches. From the Church of the Pieta, the procession carries the eighteenth-century statue of Our Lady of Sorrows (confraternity of prayer and death); from the Trinity Church, the procession carries a wooden effigy of Christ bound to the column (Arch- confraternity of the rosary), and from the Church of St. Augustine a procession of hooded penitents carries the heavy cross of Simon of Cyrene on their shoulders (confraternity of help). The three sacred processions converge in the ancient Piazza del Castello, where the statues proceed towards each other, but the embrace of the Mother and the Son is blocked by the Cross, which arises suddenly between them. =Other religious holidays= Other festivals with processions include the Lady of Mount Carmel festival (July 16), San Rocco (August 16) and the Madonna del Rosario (the third Sunday in October), as well as the recurrence of Concetta, namely the Immaculate Conception (December 8). There are also the feasts of St. Lucy (December 13) and Saint Anthony Abbot (January 17), the latter with the historic blessing of the animals. The patron saints are, respectively, Severino and Severo, and are celebrated on September 25 and the Saturday before the fourth Sunday in October. Moreover, the solemn ceremony of the vote in San Severino is celebrated annually on January 8 by the Municipal Administration, during which it remembers the apparition of the patron saint. =Carnival= During the time of the annual carnival, it is customary to prepare awkward puppets that are arranged in comical sitting positions on small chairs by the doors of houses. On Shrove Tuesday, at dusk, the people celebrate the colorful \\"funeral\\" of the puppets, which ends with the burning of the puppets, which are sometimes stuffed with firecrackers. The city does not seem to have a real typical mask, however, a more widespread traditional outfit requires that men wear flashy clothes. =Wine festival= In recent years, the old Grape Festival celebrates one of the main products of the Sanseveresi, during the Feast of St. Martin, (or Festival of New Wine) which is held in the historic heart of the city for several days around November 11, with exhibition of local products, wine tasting and local cuisine and various cultural performances (concerts, exhibitions, folklore shows, etc.). Culture =Museums, libraries and archives= Saint Augustine's Church The preservation and promotion of artistic heritage, the city's books, and periodicals are the raison d'√™tre of a number of important public and private institutions that promote the cultural development of San Severo and its surroundings. *The Museum of the Tavoliere (MAT) is set in an eighteenth- century Franciscan monastery, also known as Palazzo San Francesco. It retains a considerable archaeological heritage, with exhibits from the Paleolithic to the Middle Ages, and a gallery with works of the modern age. **Pinacoteca \\"Luigi Schingo\\" is a section of MAT, with headquarters in Palazzo San Francesco; it holds some works of the Sanseveresi artist Louis Schingo. **The community library \\"Alexander Minutia\\" is now located temporarily in the Palazzo San Francesco.

Large agricultural resources have generated a lively system of small and medium-sized industrial products grown and exported to international markets. In 1968 the Sanseveresi wine became the first in Apulia to obtain the Designation of Origin Control. The varieties are white San Severo, San Severo sparkling white, red, and Ros√© San Severo. San Severo is also noted for its production of Peranzana (Dauno) olives, which have received the Protected Designation of Origin designation (PDO). The Vase Sanseveresi is a centuries-old traditional method of pruning olive trees like inverted cones, with the focus on horizontal rather than height-based arrangement.Fonti: Scheda sull'olio d'oliva, L'Ovicoltura marginale in PugliaSalvo Bordonaro - Bruno Pizzolante, La ferrovia garganica, Foggia, Claudio Grenzi Editore, 2006 Transport San Severo railway station is a relatively important station of the Adriatic railway, and is the western terminus of the San Severo‚ÄìPeschici line.

He is reported to have stolen and hidden millions of dollars, and was dubbed \\"the postcard bandit\\" by police seeking media coverage.Nyst, Chris (defence lawyer).\\"The Usual Suspect\\" Australian Story (program transcript), 27 October 2003 Abbott was held in a maximum-security prison in Queensland until he was transferred in 2016 to Casuarina Prison in Western Australia. He will be eligible for parole in 2026. A film about Abbott, The Postcard Bandit, was made in 2003.Buchanan, Matt. (26 May 2003). Born To Run. Sydney Morning Herald. Personal A former ward of the state of Western Australia, Abbott continues to suffer anxiety and related health disorders, as noted in a semi- biographical work, Australian Outlaw, by Derek Pedley. As a hearing-impaired 12-year-old in November 1974, he was maltreated at Hillston Boys Home. Abbott attended Eastern Hills High School in Mount Helena and was considered an average to good student. His watercolour \\"Little Boy Blue\\" was painted after the November 2009 national apology to Forgotten Australians. Abbott is recognised as a highly intelligent criminal and \\"minor genius\\" with a strong reliance on memory and observational skills to carry out his criminal activities. He used his knowledge and self-taught skills in make-up to create convincing disguises, computers to create false IDs, and electronics to dodge alarms and police. Weeks were spent methodically planning each bank robbery including observing the staff in the bank, identifying weaknesses in security, patterns of behaviour and the layout of the premises prior to the robbery taking place. These skills are widely thought to have assisted him in both successful prison escapes. Police officers who have interviewed Abbott have stated he is always probing for information on how he has been caught or what the police know about him. Abbott used his understanding of police methodology and intelligence gathering to successfully avoid capture during his time as an escapee. Fremantle Prison escape ‚Äì 1989 Abbott had fled from police during questioning in relation to burglary at the Nollamara police station in 1986 and in 1987 successfully stole $11,200 from the Commonwealth Bank in Perth with his first bank robbery. In the months following, police arrested Abbott at Perth Airport. Sentenced to Fremantle Prison, Abbott was given duties in the tailor workshop, fitting and sewing uniforms to order. It was through the workshop Abbott and Aaron Reynolds were able to create fake prison guard uniforms. On 24 November 1989 Abbott dressed in the false uniform, cut through the bars in the workshop and gained access to the guard's walkway, he made his way across the rooftop and out of the prison grounds. This escape earned Abbott his lifelong notoriety as a criminal genius, and ultimately led to his permanent and erroneous branding as \\"the postcard bandit.\\" In the almost 150-year history Fremantle Prison was operational, Abbott is the only prisoner to escape and never return due to its closure in 1991.  Fugitive 1989‚Äì1995  While Reynolds was arrested within weeks of the Fremantle escape, Abbott went on to establish himself as a \\"professional\\" bank robber, believed to have been responsible for \\"40 to 50\\" bank robberies across Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland's Gold Coast. Working in Abbott's favour, the Adelaide police force was structured with each suburb having its own CIB office, limiting communication between the departments and making Adelaide a repeated target. Rivalry between the states made intelligence sharing minimal and Western Australian Police were yet to issue a warrant for Abbott's arrest almost five years following the escape. By 1994 the police states compromised and agreed to work together. Elevated to the status of Australia's most wanted man, his five-and-a-half years on the run came to an end when police tracked down a post-office box on Queensland's Gold Coast used by Abbott, which was found to contain a pager bill registered to the address where he was living. On 26 March 1995 Abbott was recaptured. Media reports in the 1990s said Abbott sent postcards of his travels to the Western Australian Police. However, the story was a WA Police media unit concoction; the \\"postcards\\" were photos Abbott lost while running from police with Aaron Reynolds after the Fremantle Prison escape, and were intended for his friends and family. They included a picture of Reynolds outside the Dwellingup police station.  Sir David Longland Prison escape ‚Äì 1997  On 5 November 1997, less than three years after his recapture, Abbott escaped with four other prisoners from Sir David Longland Prison at Wacol, Queensland. Using angel wire‚Äîdiamond-encrusted wire‚Äîsmuggled into the prison to cut through the bars in their cells, the escapees made it to the perimeter sensor fence where they were thrown bolt cutters by an accomplice, Brendan Berichon, who had been released in September. Uncharacteristically for Abbott, the escape from Sir David Longland Prison in November 1997 involved actual force rather than an implied threat of force. While cutting through the sensor fencing, the alarm was raised. Berichon was armed and fired on a patrol vehicle successfully disabling it. Guards were pinned down by the shots. The offenders alleged that this occurred in panic, when the escapees' escape plan went awry. Nonetheless, it gave the escapees enough time to cut through the fence and escape in the car driven by Berichon. Fugitive 1997‚Äì1998 Abbott was on the run for six months from 1997 to 1998. On 2 May 1998 he was eventually caught in Darwin and is, , serving a 23-year sentence in Queensland for bank robberies and the 1997 prison escape. After serving two years of his current sentence in solitary confinement, he sued the Queensland Government for mistreatment.Townsend, Ian, \\"Postcard bandit\\" sues Qld Govt over mistreatment in jail. The World Today. 20 October 2000. He was released from solitary confinement in May 2004 and returned there on a Maximum Security Order in April 2006, after he requested medical attention three times in 12 months. After years in mainstream, Abbott was again returned to Supermax solitary confinement in August 2008 and then released back into mainstream detention in the days preceding a judicial review hearing into his back-to-back Maximum Security Orders, in October 2009. Attempts to transfer A 1994 warrant for questioning remains in place with Adelaide Criminal Prosecutions Branch for one count of armed robbery in Glenelg, South Australia. In mid-2008, Abbott applied for an interstate transfer to South Australia to address the outstanding warrant. The application followed official statements by Adelaide detective Sid Thomas, in The Advertiser in 2008, that detectives were travelling to Queensland to question Abbott at Woodford Correctional Centre, although no such interview has ever occurred. In December 2010, Abbott's application for a South Australian transfer was approved by the Queensland Attorney-General, and the South Australian Attorney-General's decision is pending. On 12 June 2011, The Advertiser reporter Nigel Hunt incorrectly reported that Abbott had filed for a Supreme Court Judicial Review regarding the application to transfer to face the charges.Nigel Hunt (12 June 2011). Postcard Bandit may be on the move. The Sunday Mail. Retrieved 30 October 2012. Hunt's story concludes with an unnamed source's suspicions that Abbott could have committed not just the one he is sought for questioning over, but multiple robberies in South Australia. During Abbott's Queensland sentence, Western Australia twice refused Abbott's transfer applications in 2005 and 2008 to return to the state to complete his sentence. In 2004 Queensland authorities approved an interstate transferAAP, Postcard Bandit can move to Perth, The Age, 7 July 2004 but Western Australian Attorney-General Jim McGinty refused to accept him.O'Donnell, Mick, Postcard Bandit hopes for transfer to WA , The 7.30 Report (transcript), 7 July 2005 In early 2007, Abbott re-applied to be transferred to Western Australia and that was approved by the Queensland Attorney-General in 2008.Hansen, Peter (11 March 2007). Abbott faces parole limbo. Sunday Mail. However, former WA Corrective Services Minister, Margaret Quirk, promptly released a media statement rejecting Abbott's bid to return home. Abbott had unsuccessfully applied for transfer to Western Australia four times in response to outstanding warrants. In May 2010, Glenn Cordingley of The Sunday Times in Perth, cited an unnamed Western Australian police source who alleged that WA authorities \\"had a cell waiting\\" for Abbott, although there had been no official confirmation of such.Glenn Cordingley (15 May 2010). WA police waiting for Brenden Abbott release. Sunday Times. Retrieved 30 October 2012. On 4 May 2016, Abbott was extradited to a prison in Western Australia to serve out his sentence of 16 years, nine months and two days that he was serving for armed robberies and his role in the Fremantle Prison riot at the time of his escape in 1989 (12 years, six months and 24 days plus an additional one-third additional penalty of four years, two months and eight days in forfeited remissions for escaping custody under the law then extant). On 16 January 2017, Abbott was sentenced to an additional five months' imprisonment for the 1989 escape. In June 2019 Abbott had his latest bid for freedom unanimously rejected by the Court of Appeal. Lawyers argued the sentence should be reduced because he already spent 17 years in a Queensland jail for other crimes committed before he escaped Fremantle Prison in 1989. The court said the original sentences were appropriate and it would not intervene on the basis of mercy and noted Abbott deliberately committed crimes that led to his imprisonment in Queensland. He will be eligible for parole in Western Australia in July 2026, and his Western Australia sentence will expire in July 2033. If no further charges are laid against him, he will remain on parole in Queensland until July 2040, when he will be 78 years of age.

A-EON Technology Ltd owns the rights and develops current and future versions of Aladdin4D for AmigaOS, MorphOS & AROS. All other platforms including macOS, iPadOS, iOS, Linux & Windows are developed by DiscreetFX. History Aladdin4D was originally created by Greg Gorby at Adspec Programming in Ohio, and was an updated version of an earlier 3D program called Draw4D Pro, which integrated elements of desktop publishing into its environment. In 1996, the 3D program was then acquired and updated by Nova Design, Inc. Nova Design added many modern features and made it easier to use. It was one of the first 3D animation programs on any platform to employ volumetrics, which were primarily used to create volumetric gas. However, unlike the majority of Amiga 3D programs, it used scanline rendering instead of the more photo-realistic ray tracing technique. Scanline rendering is similar to the rendering technique used in most Pixar movies. On December 17, 2007, Nova Design sold all inventory, source code and intellectual property rights to DiscreetFX LLC. DiscreetFX is developing a new 6.0 version for Mac OS X, iPad, Android & Linux.

Ward lost the general election to Republican Louie B. Nunn, who received 454,123 votes (51.2%) to Ward's 425,674 (48.0%). Biography Ward's political career began with his election to the Kentucky House of Representatives on the strength of his editorial battles as a journalist against electric utilities, whom Ward accused of providing unreliable coverage for the prices charged. He was re-elected to the House four more times and was named majority leader before he stepped down in 1943. As a state legislator, Ward was a strong supporter of Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal. Two years later, he won a seat in the Kentucky Senate, and served there from 1945 to 1948. The same year, Earle Clements appointed Ward to be commissioner of conservation, a post he held for eight years. He played a key role in founding Kentucky's network of state parks. In 1960, Ward gained two positions in the Kentucky state government, becoming both the highway commissioner and the chairman of the State Park Board. As highway commissioner, Ward secured millions of dollars in funding from both voters and the federal government to build a vast network of Interstates and other roads. Ward had previously been active with the Chamber of Commerce in Louisville and was instrumental in having Interstate 65 routed through downtown Louisville. He later said that decision was a mistake. Ward was selected by Edward T. Breathitt as Breathitt's preferred successor as governor, but Ward was not a particularly skilled or gifted candidate for statewide office though he had been elected to both houses of the Kentucky State Legislature. He beat Happy Chandler in the primary election for governor. Chandler subsequently endorsed Louie Nunn, who narrowly defeated Ward. Henry Ward was the first Democratic nominee for governor to lose a general election since 1943, a situation that didn't occur again for the next thirty-six years, until Ben Chandler, Happy Chandler's grandson, lost in 2003 to Republican Ernie Fletcher.Other former state highway directors who lost gubernatorial races during this period of history were Fred Preaus in Louisiana in 1956 and Marshall Formby in Texas in 1962. Ward died on October 8, 2002.

It is located on the Merthyr Line and the Rhondda Line. Passenger services are provided by Transport for Wales. The station was first opened on this site by the Taff Vale Railway in 1863. Junctions Two routes formerly diverged from the TVR's main line between Cardiff & Merthyr here - the Rhymney Railway's original main line northwards to and via Junction (opened in 1858) and a much more recent spur to Nantgarw Colliery opened by British Railways in 1952 to permit the closure of most of the surviving Cardiff Railway route beyond Coryton. The Rhymney line, which diverged at Walnut Tree Junction just south of the stationSignals at Walnut Tree Junction www.roscalen.com; Retrieved 2013-09-12 was known locally as the Big Hill, due to its severe gradients (as steep as 1 in 48) for northbound trains. Increasing congestion on the 'main line' south of here led to the Rhymney company opening its own direct line via in 1871, but after the 1923 Grouping the Great Western Railway (and later BR) made extensive use of the line for its coal trains from the many collieries in the Rhymney Valley to the marshalling yards at Radyr. Both this line and the Nantgarw colliery spur are now closed and lifted - the last train down the Big Hill ran in June 1982, whilst the latter branch was finally taken out of use in 1991 after the demise of the colliery and nearby coking works some five years earlier. After the dismantling of the Viaduct, only one pier remains. This was used to display a good will message for Elizabeth II Silver and Golden Jubilee. These are still visible from the train approaching the station from the south.

Facts Graham Gaskin was placed in public care in the UK as a baby, where he stayed until he reached his majority. Gaskin claimed he had been abused during his time in care and he requested access to the records kept on him by Liverpool Social Services. Liverpool City Council gave Gaskin partial access, claiming that a duty of confidentiality owed to third party contributors prohibited disclosure of the remainder of his records. Gaskin appealed to the Court of Appeal which upheld Liverpool City Council's refusal to give him access. The Court of Appeal held that it was not in the 'public interest' to grant access to Gaskin's records because to do so would inhibit third party informants from coming forward with information to Social Services. Granting access would necessarily reveal the identities of these third parties. The Court of Appeal therefore felt that access would undermine the British system which depends on information being supplied to the Authorities by the public 'in confidence'. Appeal Gaskin appealed to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg and his case was decided in 1989. The Court decided that Gaskin's Article 8 right to have his private and family life respected by the State had been breached by the British government because there had been no independent appeal body to which Gaskin could have taken his case. The Court also decided that people in Gaskin's position, who had been in public care as children, should not in principle be obstructed from accessing their care records‚Äîthese records acted as the memories of parents, to which most individuals had access but to which people in Gaskin's position did not. Impact The Gaskin case has had a substantial impact on British law. The Data Protection Act contains special provisions whereby social services records are accessible by people formerly in public care irrespective of whether the records are kept electronically or within a paper-based filing system. At the time of the case, only information stored electronically was accessible by individuals under the UK's Data Protection regime; it now covers computer systems and any other filing system. The Information Commission now provides the independent appeal mechanism absent at the time when Gaskin sought access to his case file. In summary, the Gaskin case was a significant victory for individuals who were placed in public care as children. Such individuals now have limited access to their own records to the extent that knowledge and understanding of their childhood and early development will be revealed. However, the case files of individuals who were placed in care with the independent sector (the charities) are not caught by the access provisions of the Data Protection Act. Access to these files can only be obtained with the agreement of these organisations.

He was one of the most colourful and corrupt politicians in Victorian history. Early life Bent was born in Penrith, New South Wales the eldest of four sons and two daughters of James Bent, a hotel-keeper. He came to Melbourne with his parents in 1849. He went to school in the Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy, later becoming a market-gardener in East Brighton. In 1861 he became a rate collector for the town council of Brighton, then a fast-growing suburb. He soon began buying and selling land in Brighton, and became a property developer in new areas fairly close by, such as Moorabbin. He developed the suburb of Bentleigh, named after himself. He was a member of both Brighton and Moorabbin town councils and was Mayor of Brighton nine times. State politics In 1871 Bent was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly for the district of Brighton, defeating the veteran liberal George Higinbotham \\"to the amazement of every one\\". He had no particular party loyalties and first held office in the Service government in 1880. He was Commissioner for Works and Railways in Sir Bryan O'Loghlen's government in 1881‚Äì1883, and used this position to extend the railway line from Caulfield to Cheltenham, thus enormously increasing the value of his own property developments. His lifelong reputation for corruption dates from this period. The exposure of Bent's dealings led to the defeat of O'Loghlen's government at the 1883 elections. After this debacle Bent spent 18 years on the backbench, concentrating on his property dealings. His fortunes suffered a reversal in 1888 when a bad investment in Ringwood caused the collapse of the Thomas Bent Land Co., but he soon recovered and became a leading player in the great Land Boom that reached its climax in 1890. For instance, in 1884 Bent purchased property in Exhibition Street for 1488 pounds and on the same day resold it for 2000 pounds. In 1892 he surprised his critics by being elected Speaker as part of a complex political deal. A newspaper asked: \\"Why is Speaker Bent the first commoner in the land? Because no-one commoner than Bent can be found.\\" There was an element of snobbery in this. Bent was the first Victorian Premier with a strong Australian accent, and was held in contempt by the Anglo-Scottish Melbourne establishment. In the severe crash that followed the boom Bent was almost bankrupted, with debts of 80,000 pounds. He had transferred many of his assets to his wife's name and this saved him from bankruptcy. At the election which followed the fall of James Patterson's government, Bent was defeated at Brighton. His fate was sealed when The Age published letters Bent had written as Railways Minister in 1881, offering MPs railways lines in their electorates in exchange for their votes. Bent moved with his wife Elizabeth and their two daughters to Port Fairy, where he took up dairy farming. But he had not given up his political ambitions. In 1897 he unsuccessfully stood for Port Fairy, then in 1900 he moved back to Melbourne, and at the November 1900 election he was re-elected for Brighton. He completed his comeback by becoming once again Minister for Railways in William Irvine's conservative government. He was soon up to his old tricks, buying land in Brighton and then approving a tramline from St Kilda to Brighton that led right past his properties. \\"Tommy Bent's Statue\\" in Brighton Despite his reputation, Bent was chosen as the new Liberal leader in Victoria when Irvine quit to go into federal politics in 1904, and thus became Premier at the age of 66. By this time Bent had grown very fat and his jovial manner, together with Victoria's gradual recovery from the 1890s depression, gained him renewed popularity. In addition to being premier, Bent had the portfolios of public works and railways. Much legislation was passed relating to improvements in public health, education, old age pensions, and water conservation. At the June 1904 elections he won a comfortable majority, and did so again in 1907. His government favoured more state intervention in the economy than had 19th century liberal governments, and there was now agreement on the need for high tariffs to protect Victorian industry. His greatest boast was that he restored stability and prosperity to Victoria. During 1908, however, Bent's government began to disintegrate as a result of conflict between country and city interests‚Äîa perennial problem for non-Labor governments in Victoria. A bloc of country members led by John Murray opposed Bent's Land Valuation Bill, and to appease them Bent withdrew the bill and appointed several of Murray's supporters to the ministry. But this antagonised Melbourne Liberals led by William Watt, and in January 1909 the various dissidents united to defeat Bent in the Assembly. Bent resigned and Murray became Premier. Legacy Bent died on 17 September 1909 at his home in Bay Street, Brighton. He had been made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in 1908. He was given a state funeral and buried in Brighton Cemetery. He was married twice, to Miss Hall and to Miss Huntley. His estate was valued at 35,000 pounds, and most of this went to his daughter from his second marriage. A statue of Bent (created by Margaret Baskerville and paid for by public subscription) was erected in 1913 on the Nepean Highway, Brighton. For many years \\"Tommy Bent's statue\\" was a well-known Melbourne landmark, which, at the time of the Victorian Football League grand final, would be decorated with a cap and scarf in the colours of the team that won the premiership. In the late 1960s the statue was regularly defaced by a bucket of usually white paint‚Äîperhaps a local New Year's Eve prank. The widening of the highway in the 1970s led to the statue being moved to a less prominent location near Bay Street, where it still is; and its landmark status has been lost.

It involves articulation between the glenoid cavity of the scapula (shoulder blade) and the head of the humerus (upper arm bone). Due to the very loose joint capsule that gives a limited interface of the humerus and scapula, it is the most mobile joint of the human body. Structure Cross-section of shoulder joint. The shoulder joint is a ball and socket joint between the scapula and the humerus. However the socket of the glenoid cavity of the scapula is itself quite shallow and is made deeper by the addition of the glenoid labrum. The glenoid labrum is a ring of cartilaginous fibre attached to the circumference of the cavity. This ring is continuous with the tendon of the biceps brachii above. =Spaces= Significant joint spaces are: * The normal glenohumeral space is 4‚Äì5 mm., in turn citing: Supraspinatus outlet view X-ray, showing subacromial space measurement. * The normal subacromial space in shoulder radiographs is 9‚Äì10 mm; this space is significantly greater in men, with a slight reduction with age. In middle age, a subacromial space less than 6 mm is pathological, and may indicate a rupture of the tendon of the supraspinatus muscle. The axillary space is an anatomic space between the associated muscles of the shoulder. This space transmits the subscapular artery and axillary nerve. =Capsule= The shoulder joint has a very loose joint capsule and this can sometimes allow the shoulder to dislocate. The long head of the biceps brachii muscle travels inside the capsule from its attachment to the supraglenoid tubercle of the scapula. Because the tendon of the long head of the biceps brachii is inside the capsule, it requires a tendon sheath to minimize friction. =Bursae= Bursae of shoulder joint: (1) and (6) subacromial-subdeltoid bursa, (2) subscapular recess, (3) subcoracoid bursa, (4) coracoclavicular bursa, (5) supra-acromial bursa A number of small fluid-filled sacs known as synovial bursae are located around the capsule to aid mobility: * Between the joint capsule and the deltoid muscle is the subacromial-subdeltoid bursa. * Between the capsule and the acromion is the subacromial bursa. * The subcoracoid bursa is between the capsule and the coracoid process of the scapula. * The coracobrachial bursa is between the subscapularis muscle and the tendon of the coracobrachialis muscle. * Between the capsule and the tendon of the subscapularis muscle is the subscapular bursa, this is also known as the subtendinous bursa of the scapularis. The supra-acromial bursa does not normally communicate with the shoulder joint. =Muscles= The shoulder joint is a muscle-dependent joint as it lacks strong ligaments. The primary stabilizers of the shoulder include the biceps brachii on the anterior side of the arm, and tendons of the rotator cuff; which are fused to all sides of the capsule except the inferior margin. The tendon of the long head of the biceps brachii passes through the bicipital groove on the humerus and inserts on the superior margin of the glenoid cavity to press the head of the humerus against the glenoid cavity. The tendons of the rotator cuff and their respective muscles (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis) stabilize and fix the joint. The supraspinatus, infraspinatus and teres minor muscles aid in abduction and external rotation. =Ligaments= * Capsular Ligament * Superior, middle and inferior glenohumeral ligaments * Coracohumeral ligament * Transverse humeral ligament * Coraco-acromial ligament =Innervation= The nerves supplying the shoulder joint all arise in the brachial plexus. They are the suprascapular nerve, the axillary nerve and the lateral pectoral nerve. =Blood supply= The shoulder joint is supplied with blood by branches of the anterior and posterior circumflex humeral arteries, the suprascapular artery and the scapular circumflex artery. Function Animation of shoulder joint showing the supraspinatus muscle The rotator cuff muscles of the shoulder produce a high tensile force, and help to pull the head of the humerus into the glenoid cavity. The glenoid cavity is shallow and contains the glenoid labrum which deepens it and aids in stability. With 120 degrees of unassisted flexion, the shoulder joint is the most mobile joint in the body. Animation of shoulder joint. The muscles shown are subscapularis muscle (at right), infraspinatus muscle (at top left), teres minor muscle (at bottom left) The movement of the scapula across the rib cage in relation to the humerus is known as the scapulohumeral rhythm, and this helps to achieve a further range of movement. This range can be compromised by anything that changes the position of the scapula. This could be an imbalance in parts of the large trapezius muscles that hold the scapula in place. Such an imbalance could cause a forward head carriage which in turn can affect the range of movements of the shoulder. =Movements= * Flexion and extension of the shoulder joint in the (sagittal plane). **Flexion is carried out by the anterior fibres of the deltoid, pectoralis major and the coracobrachialis. **Extension is carried out by the latissimus dorsi and posterior fibres of the deltoid. * Abduction and adduction of the shoulder (frontal plane). **Abduction is carried out by the deltoid and the supraspinatus in the first 90 degrees. From 90-180 degrees it is the trapezius and the serratus anterior. ** Adduction is carried out by the pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, teres major and the subscapularis. * Horizontal abduction and horizontal adduction of the shoulder (transverse plane) * Medial and lateral rotation of shoulder (also known as internal and external rotation). **Medial rotation is carried out by the anterior fibres of the deltoid, teres major, subscapularis, pectoralis major and the latissimus dorsi. **Lateral rotation is carried out by the posterior fibres of the deltoid, infraspinatus and the teres minor. * Circumduction of the shoulder (a combination of flexion/extension and abduction/adduction). Clinical significance The capsule can become inflamed and stiff, with abnormal bands of tissue (adhesions) growing between the joint surfaces, causing pain and restricting movement of the shoulder, a condition known as frozen shoulder or adhesive capsulitis. A SLAP tear (superior labrum anterior to posterior) is a rupture in the glenoid labrum. SLAP tears are characterized by shoulder pain in specific positions, pain associated with overhead activities such as tennis or overhand throwing sports, and weakness of the shoulder. This type of injury often requires surgical repair. Anterior dislocation of the glenohumeral joint occurs when the humeral head is displaced in the anterior direction. Anterior shoulder dislocation often is a result of a blow to the shoulder while the arm is in an abducted position. In younger people, these dislocation events are most commonly associated with fractures on the humerus and/or glenoid and can lead to recurrent instability. In older people, recurrent instability is rare but people often suffer rotator cuff tears. It is not uncommon for the arteries and nerves (axillary nerve) in the axillary region to be damaged as a result of a shoulder dislocation; which if left untreated can result in weakness, muscle atrophy, or paralysis. Subacromial bursitis is a painful condition caused by inflammation which often presents a set of symptoms known as subacromial impingement.

The school was founded in 1848 as Folsom's Mercantile College to teach basic bookkeeping and business skills. It underwent several changes of name and ownership during its history. The college closed on August 25, 2013 at the conclusion of the summer semester. History The university was opened by R.S. Bacon as a college of business in 1848 on West 3rd Street in Cleveland, Ohio. Shortly thereafter it merged with Folsom's Mercantile College, founded by Ezekiel G. Folsom. Two of Folsom College's earliest students created the Bryant & Stratton Colleges which later acquired Folsom's school in a possibly forced merger., pg. 4 After the merger with the Bryant and Stratton system, the Cleveland school used the Bryant and Stratton name until 1867, when it took the name Union Business School to celebrate the Union's Civil War victory. The university in Cleveland was renamed Spencerian Business College in 1876 for one of its most illustrious administrators, Platt R. Spencer, educator and originator of Spencerian penmanship. The earliest curriculum was limited to the development of practical skills, such as penmanship, bookkeeping, and telegraphy. The most notable alumni of Chancellor University are oil magnate, John D. Rockefeller, rubber and tire trailblazer, Harvey Firestone, and accounting and professional services pioneer, Theodore Ernst. In 1896, Frank L. Dyke, a former Spencerian professor, founded Dyke School of Commerce, dedicated to preparing young women for business careers. Dyke School of Commerce and Spencerian Business College operated separately for many years until the exigencies of World War II prompted President Jay R. Gates to merge the two schools in 1942. For a time the combined institution was known as Dyke and Spencerian College. From 1958 to 1994, the school was known as Dyke College. After World War II, as college degrees became common in the business world, the college modified its academic programs to stress the attainment of the broader-based Bachelor of Science, Associate in Science, and Associate in Arts degrees. In 1965, the University was reincorporated as a not-for-profit institution. David N. Myers, a Cleveland business leader and philanthropist, became the school's proprietor in the late 20th century, and the college changed its name to David N. Myers College in 1995, to reflect a $2 million charitable contribution. It was later renamed Myers University in the summer of 2001 to reflect expanded offerings including an MBA program. David N. Meyers University was closed in 2007.David N. Meyers University, Encyclopedia of Cleveland History, Case Western Reserve University, retrieved September 10, 2019 In an effort to reorganize, on September 12, 2008, Myers University was renamed Chancellor University., as a for-profit institution with most of its courses offered online. On July 8, 2013 the school announced it would close. The school transferred its several hundred students to Alliant International University, a California-based, private, not-for-profit school. Programs Chancellor University was a small university that offered a wide array of business programs, although it was not exclusively a business school. The University offered degrees at the Associate, Baccalaureate and Masters levels. The Master of Business Administration program at the university was renamed the Jack Welch Management Institute in 2009, after Jack Welch, the former CEO of General Electric, invested $2 million to purchase a 12% share of the company running the university, Chancellor University Systems.Chronicle of Higher Education June 21 2009 In 2011, the program was acquired by Strayer University for about $7 million. Accreditation The university was accredited by the North Central Association Higher Learning Commission and the International Assembly for Collegiate Business Education (IACBE). In November 2008, the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools, placed the school on probation, citing problems with its reputation, student turnover and resource allocation. On February 25, 2010, the Higher Learning Commission ordered the institution to show cause as to why its accreditation should not be rescinded. On February 24, 2011, the Higher Learning Commission Board of Trustees determined that the institution had addressed the concerns of the Commission and demonstrated that it met the Criteria for Accreditation. The board removed the Show-Cause order and continued the accreditation of the university. However, the Higher Learning Commission issued a new \\"show cause\\" order on June 28, 2012. The \\"show cause\\" order was lifted by the Higher Learning Commission on October 11, 2012 and Chancellor University remains accredited with HLC. On October 3, 2012, the Board of Trustees of the Higher Learning Commission (HLC) accepted the withdrawal of Chancellor University from the commission effective October 3, 2013. The accreditation of Chancellor University through the HLC ended on October 3, 2013. The college closed after its summer semester ended on August 25, 2013. Campus Chancellor University's main campus was located at 6000 Lombardo in the Genesis Building in Seven Hills, Ohio.

It is based on the 1977 Disney animated film The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, and is Fantasyland's most popular attraction.http://web.b.ebscohost.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=4&sid;=a2049254-5bf4-4a45-953a-4069d28c2cfe%40sessionmgr103 History After the rise in popularity of Walt Disney's film adaptation of Winnie-the-Pooh, Disney Imagineers made plans in the late 1970s for a Winnie the Pooh attraction at Disneyland's soon-to-be renovated Fantasyland. However, in 1983, when the renovated Fantasyland reopened, a Winnie the Pooh attraction was notably absent. Seven years later, during a period when the character was undergoing a resurgence in popularity, plans for a Winnie the Pooh attraction were approved at Walt Disney World. Planners used an existing structure, that of the Fantasyland attraction Mr. Toad's Wild Ride. The next version of the attraction, considerably different in configuration, was Pooh's Hunny Hunt, which opened in Tokyo Disneyland. Due to a closure of all of the Skyways at Disney Parks across the world, including Tokyo, a space was left where the Fantasyland Skyway station once stood. With a budget of over $130 million, and featuring a never-before-used 'trackless' ride technology, Pooh's Hunny Hunt opened in late 2000 to large crowds and praise by many Disney internet fansites. To date, the attraction continues to have some of the longest wait times of any attraction at the Tokyo Disneyland Resort.https://ohmy.disney.com/insider/2016/03/31/luigis-rollickin-roadsters- and-disneys-history-of-trackless-ride-vehicles/ Ride-through The queue for the ride zig-zags in front of the entrance, which is shaped like a giant story book. Once inside, the rest of the line is made up of the pages of the story book which tell various parts of the story. Guests then board big, five-seater honey pots. These honey pots travel through the ride in groups of three. Upon leaving the station, and making a left into the ride, the Honey pots stop in a line in front of a short video which has Christopher Robin giving Pooh a balloon. The vehicles then enter a very large room themed to the blustery day. There are many sights in this room, and the vehicles take turns visiting the various scenes. Pooh is seen flying around on his balloon. Kanga and Roo, Eeyore, Owl, Rabbit, and Piglet are getting blown about the wind. As the vehicles unite to leave the room, Tigger bounces up and down behind a bush. The honey pots then enter a dark room with three screens surrounded by trees. A swarm of bees flies through all three before Tigger comes in and starts singing and bouncing. The entire room, the trees, and the honey pots then begin to bounce with Tigger as he bounces from screen to screen. He then jumps up into one of the trees and the swarm of bees reemerges. The honey pots then go backward down a hallway filled with branches. Tigger is seen clinging to one with a beehive stuck to his head. The honey pots enter Pooh's house, where he is seen asleep with the balloon next to him. As he mumbles, the balloon grows the ears and eyes of a heffalump and the entire room vanishes into a starfield. Pooh then floats up into the air. The vehicles then enter Pooh's dream sequence. This big room is filled the Heffalumps and Woozles that Pooh dreams about. This room is by far the most vibrant as the honey pots dance in circles with each other to a jazzy Heffalump band as colored lights and disco balls spin throughout the room. In a mirror found in the room, a balloon-like Heffalump can be seen sucking up honey from a honey pot before deflating. A Woozle can also be seen lighting a cannon shaped like a honey pot. Pooh is also seen hanging onto a living hot air balloon with a honey pot-like basket trying to reach for a beehive. There are many vehicles (one of them has a Heffalump and Woozle family riding in it) in this room and whenever three enter, three leave. The leaving vehicles exit through the trunk of a giant Heffalump which contains a tunnel. The vehicles go down the tunnel backward as Pooh spins above and projections of Heffalumps and Woozles spin along the walls. The last room the vehicles pass through is the Honey Tree, where Pooh is eating his fill while saying how much he loves honey. There is a scent of honey in this room. The vehicles then pass a big, closed storybook of the adventure and then return to the unloading area. Ride system Pooh's Hunny Hunt uses a trackless ride system developed by Walt Disney Imagineering. Although other trackless ride systems do exist on the market (such as ETF's Mystic Mover), Pooh's Hunny Hunt differs in that it uses an array of sensors as opposed to a dedicated wire embedded in the floor. A custom local positioning system (LPS; not to be confused with GPS) is used to manage these sensors. The patented control system works by directional data being relayed from a master control computer directly to the vehicles which are fashioned to resemble honey pots. This data is then used to move an individual honey pot car through a complicated matrix embedded within the actual floor tiles. Every few seconds, the master computer generates a random path and ‚Äòsteers‚Äô the honey pot in real-time, so as the cars roll through the ride the vehicles are, in fact, being told where to go. Because this system is in real-time, they can maneuver accordingly in just fractions of a second. This also allows for spontaneous yet synchronized ‚Äòhoney pot choreography‚Äô with groups of honey pots (as many as 8 in a single show scene) appearing to ‚Äòdance‚Äô with the others, often timed with ‚Äòbeats‚Äô in the music. Due to limitless variations possible, each journey through the attraction is unique. Overall, Pooh's Hunny Hunt is reported to have had a budget of $130 million. Similar rides Tokyo DisneySea, an amusement park adjacent to Tokyo Disneyland, features Aquatopia. The ride uses the same trackless technology as Pooh's Hunny Hunt; however, it runs in a shallow pool. Disneyland, Magic Kingdom, Shanghai Disneyland and Hong Kong Disneyland all feature dark rides based on Pooh. These rides operate as The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh and feature a more traditional track-based dark ride system.

It is the southern terminus of the Butetown Branch Line 1 mile (1.5 km) south of . Only one platform is now in use. The station building lies on Bute Street, although the rest of the station remains visible from the nearby Lloyd George Avenue. For various reasons, including it being the origin of the first steam-powered passenger train service in Wales, the station is a Grade II* listed building. The station is within walking distance of the Senedd and the Wales Millennium Centre Passenger services are provided by Transport for Wales. The station is due to close by December 2023, when the new Cardiff Bay station opens.  History  The line to the docks was opened on 9 October 1840 but the station was not mentioned in Bradshaw's railway timetables until December 1844. It was opened as \\"Cardiff Bute Dock\\" but the name was changed to \\"Cardiff Docks\\" in 1845 by the Taff Vale Railway (engineer: Isambard Kingdom Brunel). The station building was the head office of the TVR until 1862. After this it also housed the consulates of the Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal and Brazil, with separate flag poles provided for each nation. It was renamed \\"Cardiff Bute Road\\" by the Great Western Railway on 1 July 1924 and given its present name in 1994. =Renovation of station building= Use as a railway museum Sir Gomer operating steam train rides along the length of the platform in the early 1990s The building was restored in the 1980s and served for a time as a railway museum under the auspices of the National Museums and Galleries of Wales and the Butetown Historical Railway Society (which in 1997 relocated its activities to the Vale of Glamorgan Railway). Following this, the station building had become derelict with train passengers now using a temporary shelter. Residential and commercial property Complete restoration of the former station building (2020) In August 2017, plans to build an office and apartment block next to a Grade II-listed former railway station in Cardiff were approved. These included renovating and converting the derelict building and link it to a new four-storey building. The new building would house 10 flats, offices and a cafe. The Victorian Society said the Bute Street station was one of the oldest and most significant railway structures in Wales and last year appeared on its list of the 10 most endangered buildings. It said it supported a sensitive restoration scheme but the current proposal would cause a \\"high degree of harm to the building and its setting\\". The first stage of the development opened in June 2019.  Services  Class 121 single- unit \\"bubble car\\" (May 2007) Class 153 single-unit \\"super sprinter‚Äù (June 2019) There is a shuttle service between Cardiff Queen Street and Cardiff Bay every 12 minutes Monday to Saturdays (between 0630 and 2330) and every 12 minutes on Sundays (between 1100 and 1630) using Class 153 Sprinters and (less often) Class 143 Pacers. Some services were formerly operated by a Class 121 \\"bubble car\\", but this unit was withdrawn in June 2013.  Proposed new station  In June 2018, the new Welsh train operating company Transport for Wales Rail Services announced plans to build a line extension and a terminus station, The Flourish (since renamed back to Cardiff Bay) for the Butetown Branch, along with an intermediate station at Loudoun Square. This station, will completely replace the existing station, which will close. Part of the South Wales Metro, it will continue to serve the Cardiff Bay area and is to be opened by December 2023.

It is flanked by Manaslu to the north and Himalchuli to the south. Despite its top 20 height, Ngadi Chuli has only been climbed once or twice. The probable first ascent occurred in 1970. Hiroshi Watanabe and Sherpa Lhakpa Tsering, members of a Japanese expedition, climbed the east ridge and face. They left their camp V, at about 7500 metres, for a summit attack. About 70 m below the summit they disappeared out of sight for nearly two hours at 1:15 pm. On their return, after descending a difficult snow ridge, they suffered a fatal fall down an ice wall, from ca. 7600 m nearly down to camp 4 at 6900 m, where their climbing partners observed their fall. Neither their camera nor Watanabe's ice-ax, to which pennants would have been attached had they reached the summit, survived the crash so that no conclusive evidence could be found that they had reached the summit.G√ºnter Seyfferth (2014) Ngadi Chuli (Peak 29), 7871 m at himalaya-info.org In order to achieve a confirmed ascent of the mountain, the Japanese organized three more expeditions, in 1974, 1978 and 1982, but these all failed.

He helped develop an independent film industry in the United Kingdom (UK), founding London Film-Makers' Co-op in the 1960s, key to the avant-garde; working on independent documentaries, and founding the production company, www.largedoorltd.com Large Door Ltd. Through the Independent Filmmakers' Association, he campaigned for an independent Channel 4. Through his company, Hartog produced a series on world cinema, Visions, that ran on the channel for three years. Long interested in the Third Cinema of African and Latin American nations, Hartog at one time worked for The Other Cinema, a distribution company in the UK, to gain such films wider audiences. In the 1970s, he served as a consultant to help the newly independent Mozambique set up a film industry. After having grown up from age eight in the United States, he returned to England and Italy in the 1960s for graduate work and settled in the UK.  Life  Hartog was born in England but lived in Chicago, Illinois from the age of eight with his mother, after his parents divorced. He attended local schools until college. He always retained what the British perceived as an American accent, but, after many years in England as an adult, he no longer sounded entirely American to people from the United States. In the 1960s, trying to avoid being drafted for the unpopular Vietnam War, which he opposed, he returned to England for graduate work after college. Hartog took a higher degree in politics at the LSE and studied film- making at the Centro Sperimentale, the Italian film school. There he met Antonella Ibba, who became his longtime companion and wife. Career His first taste of film-making in Britain was acting in Peter Watkins' The War Game (he had the role of the jumpy GI who triggers the nuclear strike). He worked for a time as a producer/director for BBC Panorama, making programmes on Ronald Reagan, then governor of California; the May 1968 events in Paris, and censorship. But the programme's editors proved unreceptive to some of his other proposals, and Hartog soon left the BBC to work freelance. Hartog was a founder-member of the London Film-Makers' Co-op, the key organisation in the development during the 1960s of an independent British avant-garde. During this time, he took a wide range of jobs, from researching a report on the possible nationalisation of the film industry for the industry union ACTT, to helping Tony Rayns edit the short-lived film magazine Cinema Rising. Hartog's commitment to cinema included a passionate interest in the Third Cinema of Africa and Latin America. Whilst working at London's principal Third Cinema distributors, The Other Cinema, he was offered the post as consultant to the Frelimo Party government in Mozambique, which became independent in 1975. They wanted him to set up a state film industry. The principal result was an effective regular newsreel company, Kucha Kanema. On his return to the UK, Hartog initiated and inspired a collective of young feature filmmakers in Spectre Productions. They included Stephen Dwoskin, Anna Ambrose, Vera Neubauer, Phil Mulloy and Michael Whyte. The co-operative produced several low-budget features (usually with Hartog as producer) in its 15 years of operations. Hartog was active in the Independent Filmmakers' Association, a pressure-group that campaigned for an independent and innovative Channel 4. The success of that campaign led him to join John Ellis (media academic) and Keith Griffiths in founding the production company Large Door Ltd. It produced the channel's world cinema programme, Visions, for three years. Just before his death, Hartog completed Beyond Citizen Kane, his film on the development of TV in Brazil, concentrating on the role of Rede Globo, the largest media conglomerate in the country. The documentary is critical of the company's ties to the military dictatorship and likened the conglomerate's leader, Roberto Marinho, to the Citizen Kane figure of the 1941 American film for manipulation of news.Folha Universal. \\"Cren√ßa na impunidade\\", Arca Universal. (27-09-09). During its development, Hartog had made signed agreements with various cultural and political groups in Brazil to give them the non-TV rights, in order to provide for wide distribution in the country. In addition, his company sold copies of the film in the UK at cost, and members of the Brazilian community bought copies to send to associates in Brazil. Hartog died during the final editing of the film, which Ellis completed, and before the programme was broadcast in 1993 in the UK. When the film was scheduled for its first public screening in Brazil in March 1994 at the R√≠o de Janeiro Museum of Modern Art, Rede Globo went to court, obtaining an order for the posters and copy of the film to be confiscated by the military police.\\"Document√°rio pol√™mico sobre a Globo completa dez anos\\", O Estado de S. Paulo (08-08-03) The company continued to try to prevent the film's screening in Brazil, where it was never broadcast on TV. But, universities and political groups obtained copies and showed it unofficially (and, after a court case in 1995), officially through the 1990s. With the internet boom of the early 21st century, the film was distributed digitally, including being put on sharing networks. It has been seen more than 600,000 times, according to counts just on YouTube and Google.  Tribute by Tony Rayns  > Hartog was a unique figure in what passes for British film culture.

The play was based on an idea by Ronald E. Househttps://www.imdb.com/name/nm0396697http://www.samuelfrench.com/author/2113/ron- house and Diz White, was written in 1974 and first performed that year, by House, White,https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0924716 John Neville-Andrews, Alan Shearman,https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0790474 and Derek Cunningham at the Palladium Theater, 1031 Kearny Street, San Francisco, California. It was later made into a 1983 film, Bullshot. Synopsis The play concerns a pre-WWII plot by the dastardly Count Otto Von Brunno and his ambiguous relation Lenya Von Brunno to ruin the international diamond market by kidnapping Professor Rupert Fenton. Working against them are Hugh \\"Bullshot\\" Crummond and Rosemary Fenton (the professor's daughter). The characters are highly stereotypical: Otto a German supervillain, Lenya a femme fatale, Fenton an absent-minded professor, Rosemary a damsel in distress who faints and runs around in her underwear, and Crummond a highly intelligent and quick-witted hero. However, at many times during the play, humor arises because Crummond fails to notice something very obvious, or because he is easily defeated in a fight. Much of the play's humor comes from its audacious (and intentionally failed) efforts to recreate film effects onstage. Examples include: *At the beginning of the show, the Von Brunnos are piloting an airplane to England, then parachute out. This is represented by a model of a German aircraft dangling in front of the theatre curtain, then two dolls being tossed onto the stage from behind the curtain. The lights black out, and when they come back on, the actors playing Otto and Lenya are onstage, covered by parachutes. *There is an onstage \\"car chase\\" between the heroes and villains. Lenya and Otto stand behind a large cut-out of a car and \\"see\\" Crummond following them on the road. Then, a quick change takes place, leaving Rosemary and Crummond standing behind exactly the same cutout. This effect repeats itself until Crummond's car plunges over a cliff. *Lenya has a pet falcon named Fritz‚Äîreally a mechanical bird that flaps its wings when the actress moves her arm. *At one point, Otto \\"mimics\\" the Professor's voice to trick Crummond. In reality, the actor playing the Professor speaks with his mouth hidden from view, and the Otto actor lip- synchs. Other humor arises from the plot, which relies on bizarre coincidences and unlikely events. For instance, when Crummond and Rosemary are in a tight spot, they manage to catch a wild carrier pigeon and have it convey a message from them; or a mysterious assassin steals an important letter, but because the letter had tea spilled on it, its ink stained a cloth napkin, so that Crummond can still figure out what it said. Otto's plots to kill Crummond include poison, a tarantula's bite, a stick of dynamite triggered by the \\"Converse Force Field\\", and a sword fight. The play is structured more as an excuse for comic gags than as an actually coherent plot. The show is designed to be performed by only five actors, one of whom plays seven characters: Professor Fenton; Crummond's friend Algy; a Chinese assassin; a local police officer; a waiter in a hotel restaurant; a one-armed Scotland Yard inspector (who is really one of Otto's henchmen in disguise); and a Cockney crook. In addition, the actor playing Otto plays Salvatore Scalicio, a Chicago gangster, in a quick-change scene where he repeatedly switches between Otto and Salvatore.

In films and television  The film 10 Cloverfield Lane was not originally scripted with any connection to Cloverfield. When the film was acquired by Bad Robot Productions, producer J. J. Abrams recognized a common element of a giant monster attack between the two films, and chose to market 10 Cloverfield Lane as a spiritual successor to Cloverfield to help bring interest to the newer film, which allowed him to establish a franchise he could build upon in future. The show Parks and Recreation is often described as being a spiritual successor to The Office, which was also developed by Greg Daniels. Both shows feature characters who within the universe are being filmed by a documentary film crew, who are occasionally acknowledged. They also both feature satirical senses of humor and are presented as mockumentaries. The movie Night Is Short, Walk On Girl shares its setting and some of its characters with the show The Tatami Galaxy, and has thus been considered a spiritual successor to it. Both are directed by Masaaki Yuasa and are based on books by Tomihiko Morimi. Other films that have been described as spiritual successors include: Tenet to Inception, both Christopher Nolan sci-fi action films; and On the Rocks to Lost in Translation, both Sofia Coppola comedy-drama films starring Bill Murray. In video games  There are several different definitions of a spiritual successor game, but they broadly involve a successor work that is inspired by, or in some way builds on the design of the previous. =Common studio= Spiritual successor games are sometimes made by the studio that developed the original work, under a new title, which may be due to licensing issues.https://www.giantbomb.com/spiritual-successor/3015-425/games/ An example of this would be the work of British game developer Frontier Developments, which created two spiritual successors with the \\"Planet\\" name, Planet Coaster and Planet Zoo. These games are successors to RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 and Zoo Tycoon respectively, which were developed by Frontier in the late 1990s and early 2000s. One example of a spiritual sequel resulting from legal issues is Dark Souls by From Software, inspired by Demon's Souls by the same studio. The rights for Demon's Souls, an exclusive title for the PlayStation 3, was held by Sony Computer Entertainment, preventing From Software from making a successor on other platforms, leading them to create a new property with similar gameplay mechanics for the Xbox 360 and other platforms. BioShock is a similar example, as a spiritual successor to Irrational Games' System Shock 2. While the game was met with critical acclaim, it was considered a commercial failure, and publisher Electronic Arts would not allow a third title. After several years and other projects at Irrational, as well as being acquired by a new publisher 2K Games, the studio developed BioShock, with a similar free-form narrative structure. =Common staff= Alternatively, the successor may be developed by staff from the preceding work under a new studio name. A number of games from Bullfrog Productions have spawned spiritual successors in the years after the studio was closed by Electronic Arts in 2001. These include Godus- succeeding Populous,https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/07/peter-molyneuxs-godus-game-can- make-you-a-mobile-deity-on-ios-right- now/#:~:text=Wacky%20game%20creator%20Peter%20Molyneux,free%20on%20the%20App%20Store.

Yooka-Laylee, a spiritual successor to Banjo-Kazooie, was developed by Playtonic Games, which was made up of former staff members from Rare. =Common themes only= As a looser definition, a spiritual successor may be developed by a different studio with no connection to the first, and is simply inspired by the gameplay, aesthetics or other elements of the preceding work. These are possible because while characters and names can be protected or trademarked, video game mechanics for example cannot.https://www.gamedesigning.org/gaming/copyright/https://odinlaw.com/when- does-spiritual-successor-become-copyright-infringement/ Several examples include Axiom Verge, succeeding Metroid,https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/spiritual-successors-greatest-games/ Cities: Skylines succeeding Sim City,https://venturebeat.com/2018/09/13/cities-skylines-surprise-launches- onto-nintendo-switch-today/ and Citizens of Earth, succeeding Earthbound.https://v1.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video- games/conferences/e32014/11727-Citizens-of-Earth-Earthbound-Inspired-Atlus- Approved War for the Overworld (succeeding Dungeon Keeper) crossed through several of these categories over the course of the development. Originating as a fan-made direct sequel to Dungeon Keeper 2, the game then became a spiritual successor with no relation to the original studio after moving away from the Dungeon Keeper IP. Finally, the hiring of returning voice actor Richard Ridings presented a direct staff connection to the original. In other industries  The Honda CR-Z is regarded as the spiritual successor to the second generation Honda CR-X in both name and exterior design, despite a nearly two decade time difference in production. The Toyota Fortuner SUV is a spiritual successor to the Toyota 4Runner SUV mainly because they both share the same platform as the Hilux pickup truck. The Canon Cat computer was Jef Raskin's spiritual successor to the Apple Macintosh.  In sports  In sports, the Ravens‚ÄìSteelers rivalry is considered the spiritual successor to the older Browns‚ÄìSteelers rivalry due to the original Cleveland Browns relocation to Baltimore, as well as the reactivated Browns having a 6‚Äì30 record against the Steelers since returning to the league in 1999.

Dr Thomas Hewetson was headmaster, and in Dublin under John van Nost the younger. In 1765 he arrived in Rome with the American painter Henry Benbridge. He remained in Rome for the remainder of his life with the exception of two brief visits to Naples in 1766 and 1797. With the assistance of Thomas Jenkins, Hewetson received commissions from numerous British and Irishmen visiting Rome on the Grand Tour. He also sculpted busts of a number of local churchmen. Antonio Canova was at Rome during part of Hewetson's stay. The rivalry between the two sculptors emerged in two great commissions, the Tomb for Pope Clemens XIV and the Tomb for Pope Clemens XIII, both won by Canova. In the last phase of his career Hewetson held a two-sided production: he sculpted copies after the Antique - sometimes in marble, more often in plaster - as well as portrait- busts. His workshop was in Via San Sebastianello, very close to Piazza di Spagna.Coen 2012 Hewetson never married. He died at Rome in 1798, where he was buried in the Protestant Cemetery.

He is noted for his work in methodology. He coined the term \\"evolutionary epistemology\\" and developed a selectionist theory of human creativity. A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Campbell as the 33rd most cited psychologist of the 20th century.  Biography  Campbell was born in 1916, and completed his undergraduate education in psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, where he and his younger sister, Fayette, graduated first and second, respectively, in the class of 1939. After serving in the U.S. Naval Reserve during World War II, he earned his doctorate in psychology in 1947 from the University of California, Berkeley. He subsequently served on the faculties at Ohio State, the University of Chicago, Northwestern, and Lehigh. He taught at Lehigh University, which established the Donald T. Campbell Social Science Research Prizes. Prior to that he was on the faculty of Maxwell School of Syracuse University, 1979‚Äì1982, and Northwestern University from 1953 to 1979. He gave the William James Lecture at Harvard University in 1977. In June 1981, working with Alexander Rosenberg, Campbell organized an international conference held at Cazanovia, New York, to formulate the program of what he called an \\"Epistemologically Relevant Sociology of Science\\" (ERRES). By Campbell's own account, this project was at least premature. Campbell was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1973. In 1975, Campbell served as President of the American Psychological Association. Among his other honors, he received the American Psychological Association's Distinguished Scientific Contribution award, the Distinguished Contribution to Research in Education award from the American Educational Research Association, and honorary degrees from the Universities of Michigan, Florida, Chicago, and Southern California.  Work  Campbell made contributions in a wide range of disciplines, including psychology, sociology, anthropology, biology, statistics, and philosophy. A major focus throughout his career was the study of false knowledge, biases, and prejudices, and how these relate to matters ranging from race relations to academic disciplines where erroneous theories are perpetuated by those with vested interests in them. = Multitrait-multimethod matrix = Campbell argued that the sophisticated use of many approaches, each with its own distinct but measurable flaws, was required to design reliable research projects and to ensure convergent and discriminant validity. The paper he wrote with Donald W. Fiske to present this thesis, \\"Convergent and Discriminant Validation by the Multitrait-Multimethod Matrix\\", is one of the most frequently cited papers in the social science literature. = Blind variation and selective retention = Blind variation and selective retention (BVSR) is a phrase introduced by Campbell to describe the most fundamental principle underlying cultural evolution.Francis Heylighen (1993), Blind Variation and Selective Retention, Principia Cybernetica Web. In cybernetics, it is seen as a principle for describing change in evolutionary systems in general, not just in biological organisms. For example, it can also be applied to scientific discovery, memetic evolution, or genetic programming. As such, it forms a foundation for what has later been called universal Darwinism. = Evolutionary epistemology = Applying the BVSR principle to the evolution of knowledge, Campbell founded the domain of evolutionary epistemology.Campbell, D. T. (1987). Evolutionary epistemology. in: Evolutionary epistemology, rationality, and the sociology of knowledge, p. 47‚Äì89. This can be seen as a generalization of Karl Popper's philosophy of science, which conceives the development of new theories as a process of proposing conjectures (blind variation) followed by the refutation (selective elimination) of those conjectures that are empirically falsified. Campbell added that the same logic of blind variation and selective elimination/retention underlies all knowledge processes, not only scientific ones. Thus, the BVSR mechanism explains creativity, but also the evolution of instinctive knowledge, and of our cognitive abilities in general. = \\"The Experimenting Society\\" = Campbell also had a vision for how public policy could be improved through use of experimentation. He argued for a more collaborative method of public policy that involved various stakeholders and that used experimentation and data as a guide for decision making. The vision of this was laid out in his essay, \\"The Experimenting Society\\". His research and book Experimental and Quasi- Experimental Designs for Research became the standard in policy evaluation circles. Campbell did not start out intending to be a program evaluator, but his devotion to understanding causality, human behavior, and how to solve social questions led him there. = \\"Ethnocentrism of Disciplines and the Fish-Scale Model of Omniscience\\" = Campbell wrote an article in 1969 arguing that an obstacle to a \\"comprehensive, integrated multiscience\\" was that different areas of the behavioral sciences were clustered together and separated from other areas. That is, there was \\"a redundant piling up of highly similar specialties leaving interdisciplinary gaps\\". He wrote that often the approach taken to dealing with these gaps was to encourage multidisciplinary scholars, meaning those who are knowledgeable and competent in multiple areas, but that this was ill-guided because the level of knowledge that makes for good scholars requires specialisation. In his view, a wiser approach would be \\"invent[ing] alternative social organizations that will permit the flourishing of narrow interdisciplinary specialties.\\" These interdisciplinary specialties would then fill in the gaps between disciplines.  Further development of Campbell's ideas  In the 1990s, Campbell's formulation of the mechanism of \\"blind-variation-and-selective-retention\\" (BVSR) was further developed and extended to other domains under the labels of \\"universal selection theory\\"Campbell, D.

Bluffton‚Äôs programs are accredited by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC), and four majors have earned national accreditation: dietetics, education, music and social work. A signature feature of a Bluffton University education is the Bluffton Blueprint. Featuring both traditional classroom learning and experiential components, the Bluffton Blueprint helps students develop resiliency and look at their futures in unexpected ways. History Located on a 65-acre campus in northwest Ohio, the university was founded in 1899 as Central Mennonite College but was reorganized as Bluffton College in 1913 and Bluffton University in 2004. The university was founded in 1899 as Central Mennonite College but in its early years functioned as an academy and junior college. When the first president, Noah Hirschy, resigned in 1908, the college had only one building. In 1913, under President Samuel Mosiman (1910‚Äì1935), the college reorganized as Bluffton College with support from five Mennonite groups. The first baccalaureate degrees were confirmed in 1915. By 1930 enrollment had increased to 371 students, but it fell to 185 by 1936 as the college was battered by the Great Depression and by charges from some of its Mennonite constituency that it promoted theological liberalism. In 1929, the college had a seemingly successful fundraising drive in an effort to increase its endowment to $500,000 and qualify for accreditation from the North Central Association. However, donors were unable to make good on their pledges after the stock market crash; the college failed to gain accreditation and fell into financial crisis. In 1931, Witmarsum Theological Seminary, which had been affiliated with the college, closed its doors for good. Musselman Library was completed in 1930, joining College Hall (1900) and Science Hall (1913, later renamed Berky Hall) as the primary academic buildings. After the brief presidency of Arthur Rosenberger (1935‚Äì1938), Lloyd Ramseyer assumed the Bluffton College presidency in 1938 and served until 1965. Although enrollment plummeted to as low as 77 students during World War II, Ramseyer's tenure was marked by growth and expansion. Enrollment surpassed 300 in 1957 and 400 in 1960. The college finally received NCA accreditation in 1953. Under presidents Ramseyer and Robert Kreider (1965‚Äì1972) the college also underwent a building boom. Since 1924, Bluffton had had just two residence halls, Ropp Hall (1914) for women and Lincoln Hall (1924) for men. Ropp Annex was completed in 1958 followed by four others (Bren-Dell Hall, Hirschy Hall, Hirschy Annex and Ropp Addition) by 1967. Other new buildings during this period included Founders Hall (1951) and an addition Burcky gymnasium (1971), a sports facility with a 2,000-seat auditorium; Mosiman Hall (1960), the music building; a four-story expansion to the library (1966); Marbeck Center (1968), a student union with dining facilities, book store and other student facilities; and Riley Court (1969), a five-building complex that now house administrative offices. There were plans for future expansion and growth, but the 1970s instead were a time of retrenchment and conflict. Enrollment peaked at 789 in 1969 but dropped below 700 by 1972 and below 600 by 1975. The college fell deep into debt and made significant cut-backs. Bluffton's sixth president, Ben Sprunger (1972‚Äì1977), proposed increasing enrollment by transforming Bluffton into an evangelical college. This proposal was resisted by faculty, leading to Sprunger's resignation. However, during Sprunger's term, the college managed to balance the budget, conduct a successful capital campaign and construct Shoker Science Center (1978). Enrollment at Bluffton was below 600 for most of the 1980s, but the college experienced another era of growth and expansion in the 1990s under presidents Elmer Neufeld (1978‚Äì1996) and Lee F. Snyder (1996‚Äì2006), the first female president at Bluffton or any other Mennonite college. By 1995, the enrollment surpassed 1,000 for the first time. The college built two new residence halls, Ramseyer Hall (1994) and Neufeld Hall (2003), to meet housing demand. Other building projects included Sauder Visual Arts Center (1991), which houses an art gallery and studios for painting, drawing, sculpture and other arts; Yoder Recital Hall (1994), a 300-seat, state-of-the-art performance facility; and Centennial Hall (2000), a new academic building. Another major addition was the Emery Sears Athletic Complex, which includes 2,600-seat Dwight Salzman Stadium (1993) plus a baseball diamond, all-weather track, and soccer field. In 1995, Bluffton began a masters program in education, the first of its graduate programs. In 2004, the college, which now had three graduate programs, became Bluffton University. In 2006, James Harder became Bluffton's ninth president. He was succeeded in 2018 by Jane Wood. =Religious heritage= Bluffton University was founded as Central Mennonite College by the General Conference Mennonite Church and became affiliated with Mennonite Church USA when it was created in 2002 by a merger between the GCMC and the Mennonite Church. It has been a member of the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities since 1991. The Mennonite church is an Anabaptist denomination committed to nonviolence, social justice, and voluntary service. However, since its founding, Bluffton has been open to non-Mennonites. In fact, members of the Mennonite denomination now make up a minority of students. Historian Perry Bush, in his centennial history of the college, argues that Bluffton's distinctive religious orientation has been to avoid both secularization and generic American evangelicalism. While many other denominational colleges adopted the latter, Bluffton leaders \\"refused to separate Mennonite ethical principles from the doctrines they held in common with other evangelicals. They refused to treat peace and service as if they were add-ons, 'nonessentials,' extra- chrome options. Christ's theological and ethical teachings were all of one piece, Mennonites have insisted, and a proper Christian college would be built on the firm integration of the two.\\" Evidence of this focus can be found in the high percentage of Bluffton graduates \\"devoting lives to service occupations: teaching, medicine, social work, church ministry, and the like.\\" =2007 bus crash= On March 2, 2007, a bus carrying the Bluffton baseball team fell off the Northside Drive overpass on Interstate 75 in Atlanta, Georgia, after the driver apparently mistook a southbound left-side exit ramp for a high-occupancy vehicle lane. The bus crashed into and flipped over a concrete barrier on the overpass and fell 30 feet back onto the interstate. Four members of the Bluffton baseball team were killed in the accident, along with the bus driver and his wife. A fifth player died a week later from injuries caused by the crash. On March 12, 2008, a memorial titled the \\"Circle of Remembrance\\"Circle of Remembrance located near the baseball field was dedicated prior to a Service of RemembranceService of Remembrance to mark the one year anniversary of the event. Academics Bluffton offers academic study in more than 85 majors, minors and interdisciplinary programs; adult bachelor's degree-completion program in business management, accounting and RN to BSN; and master's degrees in organizational management, business administration with available concentrations in health care management and accounting and financial management. An Online MBA is also offered in collaboration with Eastern Mennonite University and Goshen College. Graduate courses in education are offered leading to licensure and endorsements. Bluffton University holds a certificate of authorization from the Ohio Board of Regents to confer the degrees of bachelor of arts, bachelor of science, master of arts in education, master of arts in organizational management, and master of business administration. Bluffton University is accredited by The Higher Learning Commission, a member of the North Central Association, and the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities. Students at Bluffton are not proctored during exams. Instead, students are on their honor not to cheat and to report any students who do to the instructor. Students are expected to write the honor pledge (‚ÄúI am unaware of any inappropriate aid having been given or received during this exam\\") on their exams and sign their names. The honor system was created in 1918 by chemistry professor H.W. Berky, who borrowed the idea from his undergraduate education at Princeton University. Campus Residential and intimate in nature, the Bluffton University campus is situated on 234 wooded acres in the northwest Ohio village of Bluffton. The village of Bluffton, a Swiss-German community founded in 1861, is a thriving, friendly rural community with a population of approximately 4,000. Bluffton offers dining, shopping, a hospital, movie theatre, bowling, golf, an airport, and more. Main Street offers a variety of interesting shops, including a full service quilt shop and a hardware store. It also has shops offering antiques, folk art, crafts from third world countries, sports gear and health food. In addition, Toledo is just an hour to the north and Dayton is 90 minutes to the south. =Buildings= *Riley Court *Sauder Visual Arts Center *Public Relations House *Houshower House *Musselman Library *College Hall *Centennial Hall *Shoker Science Center *Berky Hall *Mosiman Hall *Yoder Recital Hall *Buildings and Grounds Center *Founders Hall/Burcky Gym *Marbeck Center *Sommer Center =Residence halls= *Bren-Dell Hall *Ropp Hall (Old Ropp, Ropp Addition, Ropp Annex) *Hirschy Hall *Hirschy Annex *Ramseyer Hall *Neufeld Hall *Riley Court Apartments Athletics Bluffton is a member of NCAA Division III and the Heartland Collegiate Athletic Conference.

', roughly \\"Now make homemade Jam with Opekta\\" Opekta, also known as Gies & Co., was a European pectin and spice company that existed between 1928 and 1995. It is notable for its Dutch operation being based in the building at ' that would later become the Anne Frank House. Opekta started in Germany and later expanded into the Netherlands in 1933, at which time Otto Frank moved from Germany to Amsterdam to become managing director of the new Dutch operation. Otto Frank was in charge of the manufacturing and distribution of the pectin- based gelling preparations, to be used in jam making. The company continued to trade from the same building whilst Otto Frank, his family (including his youngest daughter Anne Frank) and several other Jews hid from persecution stemming from the Nazi Occupation of the Netherlands during World War II. History The Opekta company was originally based in Cologne, Germany, being founded and owned by Austrian chemists Robert Feix and Richard Fackeldey. In 1933 the German businessman Otto Frank, then still residing in Germany, was appointed to aid their expansion into the Netherlands. Frank had already considered moving his family to the Netherlands following the election of Adolf Hitler and the rise of Nazism, so he accepted the post and moved alone to Amsterdam to find premises for the company. He had briefly managed a large rival firm, Pomosin, which traded pectin to factories from the Dutch town of Utrecht but decided that retail trade would be more lucrative in the Dutch market than wholesale. His franchise for the Amsterdam branch of Opekta was established in September 1933. In December 1933 his wife Edith Frank-Holl√§nder found an apartment for the family on Merwedeplein, in the southern part of Amsterdam. By the end of 1934, the company became too cramped and moved to the Amsterdam address of . They moved once again to a new premises located at . Victor Kugler, an ex-colleague from Pomosin, came on board almost immediately to help run the company. The workforce was small; apart from a junior clerk, the only other employee was a secretary, who left a few months after the company started trading. She was replaced by Miep Gies, whose duties extended from the secretarial, to public relations and advertising. In 1938, she appeared in a promotional film to promote the Opekta product, which was used to demonstrate to consumers how easy it was to use in cooking. That year, they were joined by two other employees, Hermann van Pels as an herb specialist and Johannes Kleiman as a bookkeeper. Bep Voskuijl, who had been the administration manager when war broke out, had been taken in the previous year, 1937. After the arrival of the German occupiers in 1940, the company was re-registered under the name of Victor Kugler to prevent it from being confiscated as a Jewish-owned business. Otto Frank still remained in charge, but in secret. The company was renamed to Gies & Co. Otto Frank had to resign in December 1941 at the point at which Otto Frank and Hermann van Pels and their families were forced into hiding in the upper rear rooms of the building in July 1942, but continued to act as a silent partner in the company. Their two-year confinement, which was aided by Kleiman, Kugler, Gies and Voskuijl, was famously chronicled by Otto Frank's youngest daughter, Anne, in an autobiographical work, The Diary of a Young Girl, published in 1947. Otto Frank retired as director of Opekta in 1953 and was succeeded by Johannes Kleiman, until Kleiman's death in 1959. The building at ' was sold to developers in 1954 and Opekta was given notice to vacate the premises. By this time, Anne Frank's diary had drawn readers to visit the premises and a successful campaign saved the building from demolition. Opekta left the building in 1955 and five years later it re-opened as the Anne Frank House, a museum dedicated to the life and writings of Anne Frank. The company was acquired by Dr. Oetker in August 1995.

His 1942 textbook on hematology, Clinical Hematology, was the first dedicated work in the field, and he contributed to the diagnostic approach of anemia and copper metabolism, amongst many other achievements. Biography Wintrobe was born in Austria (Fred 2007), contrary to previous historical records. His family name reflects the Jewish origin of his parents, Herman and Ethel, who emigrated from Austria with their son Max in 1906. Canadian census records show that the family arrived in Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1906, where Ethel's four brothers were living at the time. The family moved to Manitoba in 1912. Wintrobe attended the University of Manitoba from the early age of 15, where he graduated in 1921 and obtained his M.D. in 1926. He married Becky Zamphir, and moved to the United States, where he obtained a PhD at Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1929; his thesis was titled \\"The Erythrocyte in Man\\". Initially working in Johns Hopkins Hospital, where he served on the faculty, he was appointed as professor of internal medicine at the College of Medicine of the University of Utah in 1943; he also served as the first Chairman of the Department of Medicine and physician-in-chief for the Salt Lake County General Hospital. In Salt Lake City he led research in hereditary and metabolic disorders (1945‚Äì1973) and cardiovascular research (1969‚Äì1973). He retired officially in 1965, but remained in function until 1973 (Valentine 1990). In that year he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. Works In New Orleans, Wintrobe pioneered new ways of measuring the hematocrit, including what are now known as Wintrobe indices: mean cell volume, mean cell hemoglobin, and mean cell hemoglobin concentration, all quantitative measures of the red blood cell population (Wintrobe 1932). Much of this work continued in Hopkins and Utah, where he also worked on pernicious anemia, copper metabolism and Wilson's disease, sickle-cell disease and other anemias. Wintrobe was the principal editor of Clinical Hematology, which first appeared in 1942 and is in its eleventh edition (Greer et al. ), still bearing his name. He was part of the team that pioneered the use of chemotherapy in cancer (Goodman et al. 1946). He was one of the editors of the first edition (1950) of Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine. In 1980, he published Blood, pure and eloquent, and in 1985 he published Hematology, the Blossoming of a Science. Both works are historical overviews of his field.

It details Kempe's life, her travels, her alleged experiences of divine revelation (including her visions of interacting with Jesus as well as other biblical figures), and her presence at key biblical events such as the Nativity and the Crucifixion. Kempe's book is written in the third person, employing the phrase \\"this creature\\" to refer to Kempe in order to display humility before God. Kempe claimed to be illiterate and her book was dictated to two scribes who set it down. Modern editions of Kempe's book are based on a manuscript copied by a scribe named Salthows sometime in the fifteenth century (the original manuscript has been lost). Recent research by Anthony Bale has suggested that Salthows was one Richard Salthouse, a monk at Norwich‚Äôs cathedral priory. The Salthows manuscript, then owned by Colonel W. Butler- Bowdon, was found in a country-house in Derbyshire in the early 1930s, and was identified as Margery Kempe‚Äôs book by Hope Emily Allen, who was instrumental in the publication of the second modern edition of the text. The manuscript was purchased by the British Library from Captain Maurice E. Butler Bowdon (1910-1984) at an auction held by Sotheby's in London on 24 June 1980. Prior to the discovery of the full text, all that was known of Kempe's book were pamphlets published by Wynkyn de Worde in 1501 and Henry Pepwell in 1521 which contained excerpts from The Book of Margery Kempe. Kempe's book is widely cited as the first autobiography in English; however, scholars disagree on whether it can accurately be called an autobiography, or whether it would be more accurately classified as a confession of faith or autohagiography.

Early days Johnston was born into a professional musical family. His grandmother Mamie Jo Adams was a songwriter, as was his mother Diane Johnston. Diane had written songs for Gene Autry in the '50s and scored a hit in 1976 when Asleep at the Wheel covered her 1950 demo \\"Miles and Miles of Texas\\". After a stint in the Navy, Bob returned to Fort Worth, then he and Diane Johnston collaborated on songwriting for rockabilly artist Mac Curtis, and others. From 1956 to 1961 Bob recorded a few rockabilly singles under the name Don Johnston. By 1964 he had moved into production work at Kapp Records in New York, freelance arranging for Dot Records and signed as a songwriter to music publisher Hill and Range. He also married songwriter Joy Byers with whom he began to collaborate. Elvis and Joy Byers In later years Bob Johnston claimed that songs still credited to his wife Joy Byers were actually co-written, or solely written by himself. He has cited old \\"contractual reasons\\" for this situation. The songs in question include Timi Yuro's 1962 hit \\"What's A Matter Baby\\", plus at least 16 songs for Elvis Presley's films between 1964 and 1968, including \\"It Hurts Me\\", \\"Let Yourself Go\\" and \\"Stop, Look and Listen\\". Two songs credited to Byers, the aforementioned \\"Stop, Look and Listen\\" and \\"Yeah, She's Evil!\\" were recorded by Bill Haley & His Comets (the latter song was titled \\"The Meanest Girl in Town\\" when Presley recorded it). Presley recorded \\"The Meanest Girl in Town\\" on June 10, 1964, while Bill Haley recorded his version a week later, on June 16, 1964. Columbia Records: Dylan, Cash, and Cohen Johnston worked briefly as a staff producer for Kapp Records, then for Columbia Records in New York, where he began producing a string of notable and highly influential albums (see list below). He was already producing Patti Page when in 1965 he was successful in gaining the assignment to produce Bob Dylan, followed by Simon & Garfunkel, the Pozo-Seco Singers, Johnny Cash, Flatt & Scruggs, and then Leonard Cohen. His style of production varied from a 'documentary' approach capturing a fleeting moment (exemplified by Dylan's albums and Cash's live albums) to providing subtle arrangements with strings, background vocals and seasoned session musicians (exemplified by Cohen's studio albums). After a couple of years in New York, Johnston became head of Columbia in Nashville, Tennessee, where he had known many of the session musicians, such as Charlie Daniels, for years. He produced three of Cohen's albums, toured with him and also composed music to the Cohen lyric \\"Come Spend the Morning\\", recorded by both Lee Hazlewood and Engelbert Humperdinck. At the beginning of \\"To Be Alone with You\\" on Nashville Skyline, Bob Dylan asks Johnston \\"Is it rolling, Bob?\\" Independent producer Dissatisfied with his salary earnings as a Columbia staff producer, particularly after several hit albums which earned him no royalties, Johnston became an independent producer, most successfully with Lindisfarne on Fog on the Tyne, which topped the British album chart in 1972. In 1972 he toured with Leonard Cohen as a keyboard player, and produced the resulting live album Live Songs. In 1978 he produced Jimmy Cliff's Give Thankx album, featuring \\"Bongo Man\\". In 1979, Johnston produced an album with the San Francisco band Reggae Jackson, titled Smash Hits that featured Jimmy Foot, Cheryl Lynn, Kenneth Nash, and Wayne Bidgell (the low voice heard on Jimmy Cliff's \\"Bongo Man\\" track). In 1985, Johnston produced an album Walking In The Shadow by the San Francisco band The Rhyth-O-Matics, for engineer Fred Catero's newly formed Catero label. Billboard magazine's \\"Pop Pick of The Week\\", the album's release was plagued with distribution difficulties. During a period of financial difficulty, when he was under scrutiny from the IRS, Johnston moved to Austin, Texas, and did no record production for some time. He eventually returned with work on Willie Nelson's 1992 album The IRS Tapes: Who'll Buy My Memories? (Nelson had his own financial difficulties at the time). In the mid 1990s, Johnston produced Carl Perkins' album Go Cat Go! which featured numerous guest stars including Paul Simon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, as well as unreleased recordings of Perkins' \\"Blue Suede Shoes\\" by John Lennon and Jimi Hendrix. This album's release was delayed until 1996. Towards the end of his life Johnston returned to working with fresh talent including singer-songwriters Natalie Pinkis (USA), Eron Falbo (Brazil), and indie rock band Friday's Child (USA). Falbo's album 73 was released in 2013. The final project Johnston worked on was Evolution: Live at the Saxon Pub which he co-produced for Austin band Hector Ward and The Big Time in 2015, which was released in 2016. Death Johnston was in a memory facility and a hospice in Nashville for the last week of his life before dying on August 14, 2015. His wife Joyce Johnston (n√©e Byers) died in May 2017.

It was expanded into a full-length musical and presented at the Phoenix Theatre, London on 21 March 1968 and ran for 2,080 performances. The music was written by Richard Hill and John Hawkins, with the lyrics by Nevill Coghill. There are two versions of this musical (Canterbury Tales and More Canterbury Tales), each making up about half the story.  Background  Martin Starkie was the first person to dramatise Chaucer's 'The Canterbury Tales' for the stage since it was written over 600 years ago. By working closely with Nevill Coghill and using a celebrated modern English translation of Chaucer's work, Starkie ensured that the completed text is a convincing interpretation of Chaucer's work It was considered to be very bawdy, and was written soon after the Lord Chamberlain's censorship of the theatre had just ended.  Synopsis  The musical took five tales from the Canterbury Tales and told them with song and humour. These were; The Miller's Tale; The Nun's Priest's Tale; The Steward's Tale; The Merchant's Tale; and The Wife of Bath's Tale. In addition, Chaucer's Prologue and Epilogue were spoken. The purpose behind these stories was that Harry Bailey, one of the main characters, declares that each pilgrim should tell a tale on the way to Canterbury so that the ride would be more enjoyable. \\"The Miller's Tale\\" is about a man named Nicholas, who studied astrology and the art of love at Oxford. Nicolas boards with a wealthy man named John who has a very attractive eighteen-year-old wife named Alisoun. John is highly possessive and very jealous of anyone who even speaks to his wife. One day, Alisoun and Nicholas meet while the husband is away. Nicholas grabs Alisoun and asks her to sleep with him, at first she is reluctant, but after she realises how sweet he is she agrees. However, Alisoun is afraid that her husband John might find out even though Nicholas acts like nothing bad will come of the affair. Unfortunately for Nicholas, he isn't the only one that fancies Alisoun. A very merry man named Absolon also desires her and serenades her and buys her gifts every day. Although Absolon showers her with gifts, Alisouns heart really belongs to Nicholas. So Nicholas devises a plan to get the husband and Absolon away from Alisoun. He fools the old man into believing that there is going to be a flood. However, when the time comes the old man makes a fool of himself and the whole town is there to witness. \\"The Wife of Bath's Tale\\" is about 'What women most desire'. A poor, ugly, old widow saves the life of a young Knight and magically transforms back to a beautiful young wife after a kiss. This tale is very close to that of \\"The Frog Prince\\". The Merchant's Tale is like a Fabliau. Here one can find Chaucer's most elaborate display of rhetorical art. The original production was notable for Nicky Henson's rendition of the ambiguously-entitled \\"I have a noble cock\\" (based on a real medieval lyric). The object of his affections, the Merchant's wife May, was played by Gay Soper.The remarks about the original London production including identifications of actors and song titles, are personal recollections.  Productions  The London production played for a record breaking 2080 performances with Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton attending the premiere. There were many fine moments, including Billy Boyle's performance of \\"Where are the girls of yesterday?\\" (based on the medieval theme \\"Ou sont les neiges d'antan?\\" ‚Äì \\"where are the snows of former times?\\", or \\"where is last year's snow?\\") and the Prioress's final declamation of \\"Love Conquers All\\" (based on her golden ornament with a crowned A, for Omnia Vincit Amor). The show subsequently ran throughout the world in all English speaking countries and was translated for presentations in Hungary, Sweden, Germany, Prague and Norway. It ran for fifteen months in Australia. The 1969 Broadway version only managed 121 performances. It was presented by Frank Loesser (Frank Productions Ltd) of Guys and Dolls fame, Hollywood Producer Jerry Weintraub and Martin Kummer (Management Three Ltd.). The high cost of keeping a show on Broadway at the time (80% to break even) contributed to a premature closure. However, Choreographer Sammy Dallas Bayes was nominated for Best Choreography, and the costume designer Loudon Sainthill won that year's Tony Award. In 1970, Jimmy Hammerstein, son of Oscar Hammerstein II, directed a highly successful US tour with choreography by Tommy Tune. The new, revised show included the very entertaining 'The Nun's Priest's Tale', included in the London, West End version, but not in the Broadway version. The tour was so successful, the show was scheduled to open on Broadway. However, the Producer Hal James died suddenly and the tour came to an end. In 1988 Jason Mullen and Hugh Leadon of Ortrex Ltd produced a scaled down production of the musical in conjunction with Martin Starkie and Classic Presentations Ltd, touring theatres in Wales and Kent It was directed by Martin Starkie and Sylvia Denning.

History A 2005-monument commemorating the 700th anniversary of the first mention of Oborniki and the 60th anniversary of receiving town rights The earliest known human traces in this area comes from the Mesolithic Kurgans characteristic for early Bronze Age Lusatian culture have been found nearby, as well as artifacts such as Mesolithic flint tools and Neolithic axes. =Medieval and early modern period= The area became part of the emerging Polish state under Mieszko I of Poland in the 10th century. Oborniki was first mentioned in a Latin document of Diocese of Wroc≈Çaw called Liber fundationis episcopatus Vratislaviensis from around 1305 as Obora among the villages obliged to pay a tithe to the Bishopric of Wroc≈Çaw. Cistercians once lived near the town, which was based on Magdeburg rights, although it did not actually have the status of a town. In the early 14th century, the town was transferred from the Bishops of Wroc≈Çaw to Duke Konrad I of Ole≈õnica. Along with the rest of Silesia, Oborniki came under the suzerainty of the Kingdom of Bohemia, part of the Holy Roman Empire, during the Late Middle Ages. The region was inherited by the Habsburg Monarchy of Austria in 1526 and taken by the Kingdom of Prussia in 1742 during the Silesian Wars. It was administered in the Prussian Province of Silesia as Obernigk. =19th and 20th centuries= Karl Eduard von Holtei lived in Obernigk for a few years and married Luise Rog√©e there in 1821. He described the town in his poems. Because of its good climate in the Katzengebirge (Trzebnickie Hills), Obernigk began to develop from a provincial village into the spa Bad Obernigk under the guidance of the landowner Carl Wolfgang Schaubert in 1835. In 1856 the town was located along the railway line between Breslau (Wroc≈Çaw) and Posen (Pozna≈Ñ). When cholera broke out in Breslau in 1866, many inhabitants fled to Obernigk. The town became part of the Prussian-led German Empire in 1871. Until the end of World War II, Bad Obernigk was part of Landkreis Trebnitz in the Province of Lower Silesia, Germany. Because of its spas and sanatoriums, it was popular with the citizens of Breslau and other cities in Lower Silesia. Near the end of World War II, in January 1945, the Germans evacuated most of the settlement's population, and most of the remaining residents were recruited into the Volkssturm. The settlement was captured by the Soviets in late January 1945. According to local Poles, only three buildings were destroyed in battle, and more were destroyed and burned down by the Soviet troops later on. The settlement was transferred from Germany to Poland in 1945 and had its remaining German-speaking population expelled; it received town privileges in the same year. Town hall Flag and Coat of Arms The coat-of-arms of the city is a green fir with a brown trunk on a yellow background. The fir, a common tree for this area, is also a symbol referring to the historic character of Karl Eduard von Holtei, a German poet who lived here, and planted such trees in his garden to celebrate birth of his two children. The fir was stamped with postmarks yet before the World War, but as a coat of arms was approved just in 1991. The flag of the city was approved by the Heraldic Commission, and has been the official emblem of Oborniki ≈ölƒÖskie since June 2002.http://www.oborniki-slaskie.pl/uchwaly/36/349.htm Resolution no. 0150/XXXVI/349/02 from 27 VI 2002 about Flag It presents the city's coat-of- arms on a green and yellow background.

It aims to re-frame the debate over the origins of life in non-religious terms and without appeals to scripture. This comes in response to the 1987 ruling by the United States Supreme Court in Edwards v. Aguillard that creationism is an inherently religious concept and that advocating it as correct or accurate in public- school curricula violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. One of the principal claims of neo-creationism propounds that ostensibly objective orthodox science, with a foundation in naturalism, is actually a dogmatically atheistic religion. Its proponents argue that the scientific method excludes certain explanations of phenomena, particularly where they point towards supernatural elements, thus effectively excluding religious insight from contributing to understanding the universe. This leads to an open and often hostile opposition to what neo-creationists term \\"Darwinism\\", which they generally mean to refer to evolution, but which they may extend to include such concepts as abiogenesis, stellar evolution and the Big Bang theory. Notable neo-creationist organizations include the Discovery Institute and its Center for Science and Culture. Neo-creationists have yet to establish a recognized line of legitimate scientific research and lack scientific and academic legitimacy, even among many academics of evangelical Christian colleges. Eugenie C. Scott and other critics regard neo-creationism as the most successful form of irrationalism. The main form of neo-creationism is intelligent design. A second form, abrupt appearance theory, which claims that the first life and the universe appeared abruptly and that plants and animals appeared abruptly in complex form, has occasionally been postulated. Motivations The neo-creationist movement is motivated by the fear that religion is under attack by the study of evolution. [Text in wikisource] [Text in wikisource] An argument common to neo-creationist justifications is that society has suffered \\"devastating cultural consequences\\" from adopting materialism and that science is the cause of this decay into materialism since science seeks only natural explanations. They believe that the theory of evolution implies that humans have no spiritual nature, no moral purpose, and no intrinsic meaning, and thus that acceptance of evolution devalues human life directly leading to the atrocities committed by Hitler's Nazi regime, for example. The movement's proponents seek to \\"defeat [the] materialist world view\\" represented by the theory of evolution in favor of \\"a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions\\". Phillip E. Johnson, 'father' of the intelligent design movement, states the movement's goal is to \\"affirm the reality of God\\".  Tactics  Much of the effort of neo-creationists in response to science consists of polemics highlighting gaps in understanding or minor inconsistencies in the literature of biology, then making statements about what can and cannot happen in biological systems. Critics of neo- creationism suggest that neo-creationist science consists of quote-mining the biological literature (including outdated literature) for minor slips, inconsistencies or polemically promising examples of internal arguments. These internal disagreements, fundamental to the working of all natural science, are then presented dramatically to lay audiences as evidence of the fraudulence and impending collapse of \\"Darwinism\\". Critics suggest that neo-creationists routinely employ this method to exploit the technical issues within biology and evolutionary theory to their advantage, relying on a public that is not sufficiently scientifically literate to follow the complex and sometimes difficult details. Robert T. Pennock argues that intelligent design proponents are \\"manufacturing dissent\\" in order to explain the absence of scientific debate of their claims: \\"The 'scientific' claims of such neo-creationists as Johnson, Denton, and Behe rely, in part, on the notion that these issues [surrounding evolution] are the subject of suppressed debate among biologists.... According to neo-creationists, the apparent absence of this discussion and the nearly universal rejection of neo-creationist claims must be due to the conspiracy among professional biologists instead of a lack of scientific merit.\\" Eugenie Scott describes neo-creationism as \\"a mixed bag of antievolution strategies brought about by legal decisions against equal time laws\\". Those legal decisions, McLean v. Arkansas and Edwards v. Aguillard, doomed the teaching of creation science as an alternative to evolution in public school science classes. Scott considers intelligent design, and the various strategies of design proponents like Teach the Controversy and Critical Analysis of Evolution, as leading examples of neo-creationism. Neo- creationists generally reject the term \\"neo-creation\\", alleging it is a pejorative term. Any linkage of their views to creationism would undermine their goal of being viewed as advocating a new form of science. Instead, they identify themselves to their non-scientific audience as conducting valid science, sometimes by redefining science to suit their needs. This is rejected by the vast majority of actual science practitioners.Wikipedia. List of scientific societies rejecting intelligent design. [Text in wikisource] [The AAAS, the largest association of scientists in the U.S., has 120,000 members, and firmly rejects ID]. Nevertheless, neo-creationists profess to present and conduct valid science which is equal, or superior to, the theory of evolution, but have yet to produce recognized scientific research and testing that supports their claims. [Text in wikisource] Instead, the preponderance of neo- creationist works are publications aimed at the general public and lawmakers and policymakers. Much of that published work is polemical in nature, disputing and controverting what they see as a \\"scientific orthodoxy\\" which shields and protects \\"Darwinism\\" while attacking and ridiculing alleged alternatives like intelligent design. Examples of neo-creationist polemics include the Discovery Institute's Wedge Document, the book Darwin on Trial by Phillip E. Johnson, and the book From Darwin to Hitler by Richard Weikart. Research for Weikart's book was funded by the Discovery Institute, and is promoted through the institute. Both Johnson and Weikart are affiliated with the Discovery Institute; Johnson is program advisor, and Weikart is a fellow. Criticism All of the following names make explicit the connections between traditional creationism, neo-creationism and intelligent design. Not all critics of neo-creationism are on the evolution side of the debate. Henry M. Morris, a notable young earth creationist, accepted the term but opposed the logic of neo-creationism for the very reason that it does not embrace the Bible. The Baptist Center for Ethics calls for \\"Baptists to recommit themselves to the separation of church and state, which will keep public schools free from coercive pressure to promote sectarian faith, such as state- written school prayers and the teaching of neo-creationism...\\" * Barbara Forrest, co-author of Creationism's Trojan Horse: The Wedge of Intelligent Design () * Georgetown University theologian John Haught * Journalist Chris Mooney, author of The Republican War on Science () * Massimo Pigliucci * Eugenie C.

Note that the rosette in the tignon is repeated as either a brooch or in the linen at her neck. Painting from the Historic New Orleans Collection. A West Indian Flower Girl and Two other Free Women of Color, Agostino Brunias, c. 1769.http://collections.britishart.yale.edu/vufind/Record/1670107 A tignon (also spelled and pronounced tiyon) is a type of headcovering. A large piece of material tied or wrapped around the head to form a kind of turban that somewhat resembles the West African gele. It was worn by Creole women of African descent in Louisiana beginning in the Spanish colonial period, and continuing to a lesser extent to the present day. Tignon Law This headdress was the result of sumptuary laws passed in 1786 under the administration of Governor Esteban Rodriguez Mir√≥. Called the tignon laws, they prescribed and enforced oppressive public dress for female gens de couleur in colonial society. Historian Virginia M. Gould notes that Mir√≥ hoped the law would control women \\"who had become too light skinned or who dressed too elegantly, or who, in reality, competed too freely with white women for status and thus threatened the social order.\\"\\"A Chaos of Iniquity and Discord: Slave and Free Women of Color in the Spanish Ports of New Orleans, Mobile, and Pensacola.\\" The Devil's Lane: Sex and Race in the Early South (1997): 232-246, at p. 237 Afro-Cr√©ole protest Mir√≥'s intent of having the tignon mark inferiority had a somewhat different effect, according to historian Carolyn LongLong, Carolyn Morrow.

The bright reds, blues, and yellows of the scarves, and the imaginative wrapping techniques employed by their wearers, are said to have enhanced the beauty of the women of color.\\" The women who were targets of this decree were inventive and imaginative.

Legacy Using that scholarship, historian Fernin F. Eaton, a Louisiana native, suggests sagging may be an ironic and modern twist on that defiant Afro-Cr√©ole women's protest movement. Eaton opines that while Mir√≥'s 1786 edict singled out women for acting \\"too white,\\" a modern-day version of sumptuary law, i.e., efforts to prohibit the practice of saggin', arguably singles out (largely) black males for not acting \\"white enough.\\"Hume, Hobbes and the Hood(ies), or Saggin' in the 1700s, paper delivered by Fernin F.

Tignons past and present The tignon can be wrapped in many ways, and it was and is worn in a different way by every woman. Madras was a popular fabric for tignons among both free and enslaved populations, and has become iconic. Tignons were often created out of mis-matched scraps of undyed fabric given to slaves by their masters. The patchwork of material was made to appear festive. Tignons worn by free women of color or enslaved women in Martinique, Guadeloupe, St. Lucia and Dominica , was made from Madras fabric, even had hidden messages.The Tignon and Women of Color in Old New Orleans, African American Resource Center, New Orleans Public Library The tignon is experiencing a revival in Louisiana. It is found particularly in Creole-themed weddings. Celebrities such as Erykah Badu and Jill Scott continue to wear headdresses, as a celebration of Afro-American culture.

For CLL it is a preferred treatment. It is given by mouth. Common side effects include bone marrow suppression. Other serious side effects include an increased long term risk of further cancer, infertility, and allergic reactions. Use during pregnancy often results in harm to the baby. Chlorambucil is in the alkylating agent family of medications. It works by blocking the formation of DNA and RNA. Chlorambucil was approved for medical use in the United States in 1957. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. It was originally made from nitrogen mustard. Medical uses Chlorambucil's current use is mainly in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, as it is well tolerated by most patients, though chlorambucil has been largely replaced by fludarabine as first-line treatment in younger patients. It can be used for treating some types of non- Hodgkin lymphoma, Waldenstr√∂m macroglobulinemia, polycythemia vera, trophoblastic neoplasms, and ovarian carcinoma. Moreover, it also has been used as an immunosuppressive drug for various autoimmune and inflammatory conditions, such as nephrotic syndrome. Side effects Bone marrow suppression (anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) is the most commonly occurring side effect of chlorambucil. Withdrawn from the drug, this side effect is typically reversible. Like many alkylating agents, chlorambucil has been associated with the development of other forms of cancer. Less commonly occurring side effects include: * Gastrointestinal Distress (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and oral ulcerations). * Central Nervous System: Seizures, tremors, muscular twitching, confusion, agitation, ataxia, and hallucinations. * Skin reactions * Hepatotoxicity * Infertility * Hair Loss Pharmacology =Mechanism of action= Chlorambucil produces its anti-cancer effects by interfering with DNA replication and damaging the DNA in a cell. The DNA damage induces cell cycle arrest and cellular apoptosis via the accumulation of cytosolic p53 and subsequent activation of Bcl-2-associated X protein, an apoptosis promoter. Chlorambucil alkylates and cross-links DNA during all phases of the cell cycle, inducing DNA damage via three different methods of covalent adduct generation with double-helical DNA: # Attachment of alkyl groups to DNA bases, resulting in the DNA being fragmented by repair enzymes in their attempts to replace the alkylated bases, preventing DNA synthesis and RNA transcription from the affected DNA. # DNA damage via the formation of cross-links which prevents DNA from being separated for synthesis or transcription. # Induction of mispairing of the nucleotides leading to mutations. The precise mechanisms by which chlorambucil acts to kill tumor cells are not yet completely understood. =Limitations to bioavailability= A recent study has shown Chlorambucil to be detoxified by human glutathione transferase Pi (GST P1-1), an enzyme that is often found over-expressed in cancer tissues. This is important since chlorambucil, as an electrophile, is made less reactive by conjugation with glutathione, thereby making the drug less toxic to the cell. 800x291px Shown above, chlorambucil reacts with glutathione as catalyzed by hGSTA 1-1 leading to the formation of the monoglutathionyl derivative of chlorambucil. Chemistry Chlorambucil is a white to pale beige crystalline or granular powder with a slight odor. When heated to decomposition it emits very toxic fumes of hydrogen chloride and nitrogen oxides. History Nitrogen mustards arose from the derivatization of sulphur mustard gas after military personnel exposed to it during World War I were observed to have decreased white blood cell counts. Since the sulphur mustard gas was too toxic to be used in humans, Gilman hypothesized that by reducing the electrophilicity of the agent, which made it highly chemically reactive towards electron-rich groups, then less toxic drugs could be obtained. To this end, he made analogues that were less electrophilic by exchanging the sulphur with a nitrogen, leading to the nitrogen mustards. With an acceptable therapeutic index in humans, nitrogen mustards were first introduced in the clinic in 1946. Aliphatic mustards were developed first, such as mechlorethamine hydrochloride (mustine hydrochloride) which is still used in the clinic today. In the 1950s, aromatic mustards like chlorambucil were introduced as less toxic alkylating agents than the aliphatic nitrogen mustards, proving to be less electrophilic and react with DNA more slowly. Additionally, these agent can be administered orally, a significant advantage. Chlorambucil was first synthesized by Everett et al.

It is the result of a mutation in the GBE1 gene, which causes a defect in the glycogen branching enzyme. Therefore, glycogen is not made properly and abnormal glycogen molecules accumulate in cells; most severely in cardiac and muscle cells. The severity of this disease varies on the amount of enzyme produced. Glycogen Storage Disease Type IV is autosomal recessive, which means each parent has a mutant copy of the gene but show no symptoms of the disease. It affects 1 in 800,000 individuals worldwide, with 3% of all Glycogen Storage Diseases being type IV.\\"Glycogen Storage Disease Type IV.\\" Genetics Home Reference. U.S. National Library of Medicine, 10 Sept. 2015. Web. 27 Sept. 2015. Human pathology It is a result of the absence of the glycogen branching enzyme, which is critical in the production of glycogen. This leads to very long unbranched glucose chains being stored in glycogen. The long unbranched molecules have a low solubility which leads to glycogen precipitation in the liver. These deposits subsequently build up in the body tissue, especially the heart and liver. The inability to breakdown glycogen in muscle cells causes muscle weakness. The probable end result is cirrhosis and death within 5 years. In adults, the activity of the enzyme is higher and symptoms do not appear until later in life.

If S \\\\subseteq T, then S is said to span T if t \\\\triangleleft S for every t \\\\in T. S is said to be a basis of X if S is independent and S spans X. Remark. If X is a non-empty set with a dependence relation \\\\triangleleft, then X always has a basis with respect to \\\\triangleleft. Furthermore, any two bases of X have the same cardinality. Examples * Let V be a vector space over a field F. The relation \\\\triangleleft, defined by \\\\upsilon \\\\triangleleft S if \\\\upsilon is in the subspace spanned by S, is a dependence relation. This is equivalent to the definition of linear dependence. * Let K be a field extension of F. Define \\\\triangleleft by \\\\alpha \\\\triangleleft S if \\\\alpha is algebraic over F(S). Then \\\\triangleleft is a dependence relation. This is equivalent to the definition of algebraic dependence.

Though information on her life are scarce, she is mostly remembered for sacrificing her life in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms at the Battle of Changban to assure that Zhao Yun and the infant Liu Shan are safe from their pursuers. Life Lady Mi was from Qu County (), Donghai Commandery (), which is present-day Lianyungang, Jiangsu. She had two brothers: Mi Zhu and Mi Fang from the influential and wealthy Mi clan in the Xu Province (present-day northern Jiangsu), who previously served the warlord Tao Qian. After Tao Qian's death, they supported Liu Bei to be the Governor of Xu Province and joined his side. When L√º Bu led his forces to seize Xiapi(‰∏ãÈÇ≥; present-day Pizhou, Jiangsu), the capital of Xu Province from Zhang Fei. Mi Zhu sponsored Liu Bei with all of his family wealth and Lady Mi become Liu Bei's first wife during his family absence. Some domestic complications must have followed, for we are told Liu Bei made peace with L√º Bu soon afterwards and his family was returned to him. Lady Mi is never referred again. Liu Bei's family was captured once more by L√º Bu in 198, to be again returned later, and in 200 he was obliged to abandon his dependants to Cao Cao: that group never rejoined him. Had the Lady Mi been involved in those later incidents, one might expect that she would have been mentioned so she probably died earlier about 197.A Biographical Dictionary of Later Han to the Three Kingdoms (23-220 AD) By Rafe de Crespigny In Romance of the Three Kingdoms Lady Mi addressing Zhao Yun before her suicide, from a Peking opera performance by Shanghai Jingju Theatre Company on May 3, 2015, in Tianchan Theatre, Shanghai, China. In the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, during the Battle of Changban, Lady Mi was lost in the midst of the battle and was injured while carrying Liu Bei's infant son Liu Shan with her. Zhao Yun went to search for them and found them beside a well. Zhao urged her to follow him but she refused, not wishing to burden him. After entrusting Liu Shan to Zhao, Lady Mi committed suicide by throwing herself into the well. Zhao knocked down a wall to cover the well to prevent their pursuers from finding her body. A poem honored her sacrifice with those lines: The embattled captain had to have his steed; On foot he could not save the little prince. Her death preserved the Liu dynastic line: For bold decision mark this heroine. Later on, when Guan Yu met Liu Bei after they escaped with Lady Gan and saw that Lady Mi was absent, he asked his brother why he couldn't see his other sister in law. Liu Bei could only recount her heroic sacrifice to save Liu Shan in Dangyang. Guan Yu sighed and reproched him not going with his advice during Cao Cao's hunting expedition at the capital.Romance of the Three Kingdoms In popular culture =Video games= Mei Sanniang from Kessen II is based upon Lady Mi. In the game, she is an old friend of Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei. She serves as a political adviser and leads a cavalry unit into battle.

As a player he represented Liaoning FC where he won the Golden Boot in the 1999 league season before joining Shanghai Shenhua. He would also move abroad to A-League side Adelaide United before returning to China to end his career with lower sides Nanjing Yoyo and Shenyang Dongjin. Since retiring he has moved into coaching where he is the current manager of the Guangzhou F.C. Reserve team. Biography Born in Shenyang, China, Qu's first team football club was Liaoning FC. He soon excelled at the club and became one of the top strikers in China. Qu was the top goal scorer in the Chinese league in 1999 with 17 goals. Along with being top scorer Qu was also voted \\"Mr Soccer of China\\" for 1999, the award for the top player of the year. Qu joined Shanghai Shenhua in 2000 and scored a total of 38 goals for the club during his fours years there, which included him winning the 2003 league title. Unfortunately in 2013 the Chinese Football Association would revoke the league title after it was discovered the Shenhua General manager Lou Shifang had bribed officials to be bias to Shenhua in games that season. After a successful trial with Adelaide United in February 2005, Qu was quickly signed by the club in April of the same year. Eastern promise arrives right on Qu, The Sydney Morning Herald, July 15, 2005. He scored his first goal in the A-League on September 18, 2005 in a 2-1 victory over Perth Glory. Qu soon established himself as a top striker in the A-League. He finished the season with seven goals in 17 appearances for the club. Qu went back to China after the season was over citing he and his family were homesick. He signed with Nanjing Yoyo of the Chinese Jia League in March 2006. After just 4 months in China and a string of poor performances, Qu signed with Adelaide United once again. In December 2006, Qu's status as Adelaide United's marquee player came into doubt as his ankle injury ruled him out for the rest of the 2006-2007 season, plus the Asian Champions League (which United qualified for on the back of its 2005-06 A-League season minor premiership). With clubs unable to sign players on guest signings for the Champions League, United faced a front-line strike problem as highlighted in the Adelaide Advertiser on 18 December 2006. In April 2007, Qu returned to Shanghai after Adelaide United declined to renew his contract for the 2007-08 A-League season, Adelaide United releases Chinese striker, The Sydney Morning Herald, 13 April 2007. although he indicated he hoped to stay in contact with the club, and apply for permanent residency in Australia.Qu departs Adelaide, The World Game (SBS), 13 April 2007.

The airport is classified as an airport of entry by NAV CANADA and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency on a call out basis from the Queenston-Lewiston Bridge. CBSA officers at this airport currently can handle general aviation aircraft only, with no more than 15 passengers. History =Pre-World War II= * March 1929 - The St. Catharines Flying Club (S.C.F.C.) completed the requirements necessary to qualify for government assistance. * June 1929 - The S.C.F.C. received its first aircraft and became operational. * September 13‚Äì15, 1929 - Official opening of the S.C.F.C. In 1929, the facilities were described by the S.C.F.C. in one of their publications as follows: =World War II - No. 9 Elementary Flying Training School (E.F.T.S.)= Plaque for the BCATP, No. 9 EFTS, J. G. Magee, Jr. Murton A. Seymour, president of the St. Catharines Flying Club (S.C.F.C.) was instrumental in forming the Canadian Flying Clubs Association. He travelled to Ottawa in 1939 to meet the Minister of National Defence, Ian Alistair Mackenzie, in an attempt to have the government support air training through existing flying clubs. With the outbreak of World War II many flying clubs, including the S.C.F.C, saw their resources being stretched to the limit. This was due to new members hoping to gain qualifications in an attempt to automatically qualify for the Royal Canadian Air Force. Seymour advocated for the placement of an Elementary Flying Training School (E.F.T.S.) at St. Catharines as part of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. This goal was realized on 12 August 1940 when the Royal Canadian Air Force Headquarters announced the creation of No. 9 E.F.T.S. to be located at St. Catharines. The school was set to open on 15 March 1941 with an initial intake of 24 students. Shortly thereafter, an order was received from Ottawa announcing that the new opening date was to be 15 October 1940 and that the school was expected to accept 28 students. One of the challenges faced by the S.C.F.C. was soft field conditions. To counter this, construction of new runways began in May 1941, which helped to ensure the permanency of the St. Catharines airport. No. 9 E.F.T.S. was formally disbanded on 14 January 1944. When the school closed it had accepted 2,468 student pilots. Of these, 1,848 graduated from the program. The total air time for the school was 134,011 hours. After No. 9 E.F.T.S. was disbanded the airport became home to RCAF No. 4 Wireless School Flying Squadron. This unit was located at the airport until 15 August 1945.Airport History  Niagara Airport facilities The terminal building at the St. Catharines/Niagara District Airport. The airport primarily serves general aviation (GA) aircraft, but it is not unusual to see chartered aircraft (turboprops and business jets) delivering passengers to waiting limousines for a ride to the Niagara Fallsview Casino Resort or other local attractions. In the past, the airport has also hosted delivery aircraft bringing rush order parts for the nearby General Motors plants. The airport is home base for the Civil Air Rescue Emergency Service (CARES) Niagara,Civil Air Rescue Emergency Service (CARES) Niagara Unit #11 of Ontario Civil Air Search and Rescue AssociationCivil Air Search And Rescue Association (CASARA). CARES Niagara is a charitable organization which promotes aviation safety and provides civilian voluntary search and rescue (SAR) service in a support role to the Canadian military. It is also not unusual to see Royal Canadian Air Force search and rescue aircraft on the ramp refueling while on search and rescue or training missions in the region. The Southern Ontario Gliding Centre (SOGC) of the Royal Canadian Air Cadets utilize the airport for spring and fall familiarization flights for the cadets.

The town lies in the Thur River Valley near the Vosges mountains. History The town is first mentioned about 1250. Before the early 1900s the town was known only as Bitschwiller. It was destroyed by Norman mercenaries during the Hundred Years' War. By 1624 about 100 people lived in this village. Immigrants from Germany and Switzerland arrived during the 1650s. The entire Alsace region was fought over many times between the French and Germans. Germany ruled this area (including Bitschwiller) in 1874-1918 and again 1940-1945. This was and continues to be an industrialised area. Iron mining began in the 1470s but only for a short while. Mining returned in 1735 and a metalworks was built. A foundry opened in 1739. A weaving factory opened in 1826. As the industrialization continued, steam engines and locomotives were built beginning in 1836, although rail lines did not yet come to Bitschwiller and the locomotives were transported from Bitschwiller by oxen. The Dampf Pfifla (or Steam Whistle) was invented there about 1836. On 25 October 1838 the first locomotive ever built by French engineers was tried on the St. Cloud and Paris Railway. Its name was the Alsace. The locomotive was a success, attaining a speed of about 33 miles per hour. It was built at the manufacturing plant of Messrs. Stehelin and Huber, in Bitschwiller. The firm was large enough to supply locomotives at a rate of 12 per year at that time.\\"Mechanics' Magazine\\", Museum, Register, Journal and Gazette, Saturday December 8, 1838, page 160 The Catholic Church named St. Alphonse is in Bitschwiller, whose famous Callinet organ dates back to 1838. Alsace has over 1350 organs and has been called the world capital of the organ. The peak of population was 3,379 people in 1856. Smaller surrounding villages include Erzenbach, Busenbach and Wickenbaechle. Emigration began about 1845-1846 and continued for over 20 years. Currently the village population is about 2,000 people. Geography The elevation near the town center is about 357m but rises quickly to as high as 920m within . The town lies roughly north-northhwest to south-southeast along the Thur River with the main road leading through town this way. The surrounding hillsides are forested.

Holopaw, a Creek Indian word meaning \\"Walkway\\" or \\"Pavement\\", was a stop along the Kissimmee Valley extension of the FEC railroad. JM Griffin began a sawmill operation here in 1923, building streets and houses for his employees. Holopaw was a company owned town, with most employees renting their homes and frequenting the factory owned general store. The JM Griffin Lumber Company became the largest operation in the St Cloud area, employing over 500 people. It also featured one of the first all-electric sawmills in the country. The mill lasted until 1931, closing during the Great Depression. A new mill owned by the Peavy- Wilson Lumber Co. opened in 1935, employing more than one thousand timber, turpentine, and sawmill workers. At the town's peak it had more than 2,000 people. When the railroad line was discontinued, the mill closed, bringing an end to the town. Most residents left to seek employment elsewhere, and the postal service was discontinued in 1954.

Put in another way, the theorem says there is a basis for V such that all linear transformations in \\\\pi(\\\\mathfrak{g}) are represented by upper triangular matrices. This is a generalization of the result of Frobenius that commuting matrices are simultaneously upper triangularizable, as commuting matrices form an abelian Lie algebra, which is a fortiori solvable. A consequence of Lie's theorem is that any finite dimensional solvable Lie algebra over a field of characteristic 0 has a nilpotent derived algebra (see #Consequences). Also, to each flag in a finite-dimensional vector space V, there correspond a Borel subalgebra (that consist of linear transformations stabilizing the flag); thus, the theorem says that \\\\pi(\\\\mathfrak{g}) is contained in some Borel subalgebra of \\\\mathfrak{gl}(V).  Counter-example  For algebraically closed fields of characteristic p>0 Lie's theorem holds provided the dimension of the representation is less than p (see the proof below), but can fail for representations of dimension p. An example is given by the 3-dimensional nilpotent Lie algebra spanned by 1, x, and d/dx acting on the p-dimensional vector space k[x]/(xp), which has no eigenvectors. Taking the semidirect product of this 3-dimensional Lie algebra by the p-dimensional representation (considered as an abelian Lie algebra) gives a solvable Lie algebra whose derived algebra is not nilpotent.  Proof  The proof is by induction on the dimension of \\\\mathfrak{g} and consists of several steps. (Note: the structure of the proof is very similar to that for Engel's theorem.) The basic case is trivial and we assume the dimension of \\\\mathfrak{g} is positive. We also assume V is not zero. For simplicity, we write X \\\\cdot v = \\\\pi(X) v. Step 1: Observe that the theorem is equivalent to the statement: :*There exists a vector in V that is an eigenvector for each linear transformation in \\\\pi(\\\\mathfrak{g}). :Indeed, the theorem says in particular that a nonzero vector spanning V_{n-1} is a common eigenvector for all the linear transformations in \\\\pi(\\\\mathfrak{g}). Conversely, if v is a common eigenvector, take V_{n-1} to its span and then \\\\pi(\\\\mathfrak{g}) admits a common eigenvector in the quotient V/V_{n-1}; repeat the argument. Step 2: Find an ideal \\\\mathfrak{h} of codimension one in \\\\mathfrak{g}. :Let D\\\\mathfrak{g} = [\\\\mathfrak{g}, \\\\mathfrak{g}] be the derived algebra. Since \\\\mathfrak{g} is solvable and has positive dimension, D\\\\mathfrak{g} e \\\\mathfrak{g} and so the quotient \\\\mathfrak{g}/D\\\\mathfrak{g} is a nonzero abelian Lie algebra, which certainly contains an ideal of codimension one and by the ideal correspondence, it corresponds to an ideal of codimension one in \\\\mathfrak{g}. Step 3: There exists some linear functional \\\\lambda in \\\\mathfrak{h}^* such that :V_{\\\\lambda} = \\\\\\\\{ v \\\\in V  X \\\\cdot v = \\\\lambda(X) v, X \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{h} \\\\\\\\} is nonzero. :This follows from the inductive hypothesis (it is easy to check that the eigenvalues determine a linear functional). Step 4: V_{\\\\lambda} is a \\\\mathfrak{g}-module. :(Note this step proves a general fact and does not involve solvability.) :Let Y be in \\\\mathfrak{g}, v \\\\in V_{\\\\lambda} and set recursively v_0 = v, \\\\, v_{i+1} = Y \\\\cdot v_i. For any X \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{h}, since \\\\mathfrak{h} is an ideal, ::X \\\\cdot v_i = \\\\lambda(X) v_i + \\\\lambda([X, Y]) v_{i-1}. :This says that X (that is \\\\pi(X)) restricted to U = \\\\operatorname{span} \\\\\\\\{ v_i  i \\\\ge 0 \\\\\\\\} is represented by a matrix whose diagonal is \\\\lambda(X) repeated. Hence, \\\\dim(U) \\\\lambda([X, Y]) = \\\\operatorname{tr}([\\\\pi(X)_U, \\\\pi(Y)_U]) = 0. Since \\\\dim(U) is invertible, \\\\lambda([X, Y]) = 0 and Y \\\\cdot v is an eigenvector for X. Step 5: Finish up the proof by finding a common eigenvector. :Write \\\\mathfrak{g} = \\\\mathfrak{h} + L where L is a one-dimensional vector subspace. Since the base field k is algebraically closed, there exists an eigenvector in V_{\\\\lambda} for some (thus every) nonzero element of L. Since that vector is also eigenvector for each element of \\\\mathfrak{h}, the proof is complete. \\\\square  Consequences  The theorem applies in particular to the adjoint representation \\\\operatorname{ad}: \\\\mathfrak{g} \\\\to \\\\mathfrak{gl}(\\\\mathfrak{g}) of a (finite-dimensional) solvable Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{g}; thus, one can choose a basis on \\\\mathfrak{g} with respect to which \\\\operatorname{ad}(\\\\mathfrak{g}) consists of upper-triangular matrices. It follows easily that for each x, y \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{g}, \\\\operatorname{ad}([x, y]) = [\\\\operatorname{ad}(x), \\\\operatorname{ad}(y)] has diagonal consisting of zeros; i.e., \\\\operatorname{ad}([x, y]) is a nilpotent matrix. By Engel's theorem, this implies that [\\\\mathfrak g, \\\\mathfrak g] is a nilpotent Lie algebra; the converse is obviously true as well. Moreover, whether a linear transformation is nilpotent or not can be determined after extending the base field to its algebraic closure. Hence, one concludes the statement: :A finite- dimensional Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak g over a field of characteristic zero is solvable if and only if the derived algebra D \\\\mathfrak g = [\\\\mathfrak g, \\\\mathfrak g] is nilpotent. Lie's theorem also establishes one direction in Cartan's criterion for solvability: if V is a finite-dimensional vector over a field of characteristic zero and \\\\mathfrak{g} \\\\subset \\\\mathfrak{gl}(V) a Lie subalgebra, then \\\\mathfrak{g} is solvable if and only if \\\\operatorname{tr}(XY) = 0 for every X \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{g} and Y \\\\in [\\\\mathfrak{g}, \\\\mathfrak{g}]. Indeed, as above, after extending the base field, the implication \\\\Rightarrow is seen easily. (The converse is more difficult to prove.) Lie's theorem (for various V) is equivalent to the statement: :For a solvable Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak g, each finite-dimensional simple \\\\mathfrak{g}-module (i.e., irreducible as a representation) has dimension one. Indeed, Lie's theorem clearly implies this statement. Conversely, assume the statement is true. Given a finite-dimensional \\\\mathfrak g-module V, let V_1 be a maximal \\\\mathfrak g-submodule (which exists by finiteness of the dimension). Then, by maximality, V/V_1 is simple; thus, is one-dimensional. The induction now finishes the proof. The statement says in particular that a finite-dimensional simple module over an abelian Lie algebra is one-dimensional; this fact remains true without the assumption that the base field has characteristic zero. Here is another quite useful application: :Let \\\\mathfrak{g} be a finite- dimensional Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero with radical \\\\operatorname{rad}(\\\\mathfrak{g}). Then each finite- dimensional simple representation \\\\pi: \\\\mathfrak{g} \\\\to \\\\mathfrak{gl}(V) is the tensor product of a simple representation of \\\\mathfrak{g}/\\\\operatorname{rad}(\\\\mathfrak{g}) with a one-dimensional representation of \\\\mathfrak{g} (i.e., a linear functional vanishing on Lie brackets). By Lie's theorem, we can find a linear functional \\\\lambda of \\\\operatorname{rad}(\\\\mathfrak{g}) so that there is the weight space V_{\\\\lambda} of \\\\operatorname{rad}(\\\\mathfrak{g}). By Step 4 of the proof of Lie's theorem, V_{\\\\lambda} is also a \\\\mathfrak{g}-module; so V = V_{\\\\lambda}. In particular, for each X \\\\in \\\\operatorname{rad}(\\\\mathfrak{g}), \\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\pi(X)) = \\\\dim(V) \\\\lambda(X). Extend \\\\lambda to a linear functional on \\\\mathfrak{g} that vanishes on [\\\\mathfrak g, \\\\mathfrak g]; \\\\lambda is then a one-dimensional representation of \\\\mathfrak{g}. Now, (\\\\pi, V) \\\\simeq (\\\\pi, V) \\\\otimes (-\\\\lambda) \\\\otimes \\\\lambda. Since \\\\pi coincides with \\\\lambda on \\\\operatorname{rad}(\\\\mathfrak{g}), we have that V \\\\otimes (-\\\\lambda) is trivial on \\\\operatorname{rad}(\\\\mathfrak{g}) and thus is the restriction of a (simple) representation of \\\\mathfrak{g}/\\\\operatorname{rad}(\\\\mathfrak{g}). \\\\square  See also  *Engel's theorem, which concerns a nilpotent Lie algebra. *Lie‚ÄìKolchin theorem, which is about a (connected) solvable linear algebraic group.

It was directed by Michael Tuchner and Alan Hume and produced by Norman Rosemont and Malcolm J. Christopher. It starred Anthony Hopkins, Derek Jacobi, Lesley- Anne Down and John Gielgud. The film was produced as part of the long-running Hallmark Hall of Fame series and was televised on CBS on February 4, 1982. Different ending The ending of the 1982 movie is very different. Not only does Esmeralda survive, but she recognizes Quasimodo's kindness toward her and kisses him goodbye before she leaves in safety with the poet Gringoire. Quasimodo also kills Frollo in self-defense by impaling him on a hook in the wall rather than throwing him off of the tower. After Frollo is killed and Gringoire and Esmeralda leave, soldiers pursue Quasimodo and he plunges to his death from the parapet of Notre Dame, with the word \\"Why?\\" on his lips.

It occurs in dense underbrush from central Kenya to KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa. Suni are around 12‚Äì17 inches (30‚Äì43 cm) high at the shoulder and weigh 10‚Äì12 pounds (4.5‚Äì5.4 kg). They are usually reddish brown, darker on their back than their sides and legs. The belly, chin, throat and insides of legs are white. The nostrils are prominent red, and there are black rings around the eyes and above the hooves. Males have horns 3‚Äì5 inches (8‚Äì13 cm) long, that are ridged most of their length and curve backwards close to their heads. Females do not have horns. Suni can make weak barking and whistling sounds. Suni feed on leaves, fungi, fruits and flowers, and need almost no free water. They are shy, most active at night, and sleep during the day in a shady, sheltered area. They are social but males defend a territory of about three hectares. They scent-mark the boundaries with secretions from their preorbital glands. There may be an individual or communal dung pile on the periphery of the territory. A male usually takes one mate, but other females may share his territory. A single calf is born weighing about two pounds, after a gestation of 183 days. Lions, birds of prey, snakes, and other meat-eaters prey on suni. For protection, they are well camouflaged in dry grass and keep very still. When a predator is almost on top of them, they spring out and bound away into the underbrush. Taxonomy and etymology The scientific name of the suni is Neotragus moschatus. It is placed in the genus Neotragus - along with (formerly) Bates's pygmy antelope (Neotragus batesi) and the royal antelope (Neotragus pygmaeus) - and in the family Bovidae. The common name \\"suni\\" is the name for this antelope in southeastern Africa. Four subspecies are identified, though these are sometimes considered to be independent species: *N. m. kirchenpaueri (Pagenstecher, 1885) *N. m. livingstonianus (Kirk, 1865) *N. m. moschatus (Von Dueben, 1846) *N. m. zuluensis (Thomas, 1898) Description The suni is a small antelope, but larger than the other two species of its genus. This antelope resembles Bates's pygmy antelope in terms of cranial measurements. The suni stands at the shoulder; the head-and-body length is typically between . Both sexes weigh between . Horns are present only on males; sexual dimorphism in the suni is less marked than in Bates's pygmy antelope. Threats and conservation Populations of the suni have been notably reduced due to poaching, habitat loss and predation by dogs - especially in South Africa, where it is confined mainly to the northeastern KwaZulu-Natal. Nevertheless, the antelope is known for its tolerance to heavy hunting pressure, and is listed as a species of Least Concern.

They also include public services such as transportation of passengers or property as a common carrier, such as airlines, railroads, trucking, bus, and taxicab companies. Public service (or utility) companies may operate under certificates of public convenience and necessity which may limit competition. Their services may be subject to rate control and other regulations which are not common to general businesses. The concept of public service companies was that, in order to attract sufficient private investment capital and guarantee sufficient revenues to ensure appropriate operations and services, protection from ruinous competition and additional governmental oversight of rates and services were required to balance the needs of the owners of the business with those of the general public. Under concepts of deregulation, many principles under which public service companies have long operated are negated and replaced by those of a competitive market. In the United States, at an interstate level, most airlines, railroad, and trucking and bus transportation services were deregulated in the last quarter of the 20th century. Many of the changes in the laws at the federal level had the effect of deregulation or substantially weakened similar state and local laws regarding the same services.

It is housed in the Harold and Wilma Good Library on the campus of Goshen College in Goshen, Indiana. The specialty library was founded in 1906 under the guidance of Harold S. Bender and Ernst Correll. Historian John D. Roth is the current director.  History  = Early years = On June 13, 1906, the Goshen College Alumni Association unanimously passed a resolution to establish a Mennonite Historical Library on campus. Already at that date, alumni were committed to fostering the Anabaptist-Mennonite heritage that still informs the purpose of Goshen College and is part of its distinctive character. The suggestion may have originated with C. Henry Smith, then professor of history at the college. Smith, together with the Alumni Association executive committee, served on the book selection committee for the proposed library. By the following June, out of its endowment earnings of $82.50, the Association had expended $33.88 to nurture the growth of the infant collection. Six years later, not long before Smith departed for what is now Bluffton University, the Alumni Association formally presented the collection, then numbering about 80 volumes, to Goshen College. Among the early volumes were a 1771 edition of the Dordrecht Confession of Faith in French translation; an inventory of the Mennonite Archives in Amsterdam; C.H. Wedel's German-language general history of the Mennonites (the first written and published in America); and Helen Reimensnyder Martin's book Tillie, a Mennonite Maid. The collection grew only modestly during the following decade, a period of turmoil for the college. One of the earliest North American institutional collections of Anabaptist Mennonite materials, the archive has grown over the past century to truly earn the description, prematurely granted by early Goshen catalogs, as \\"one of the most valuable of its kind in America.\\" = Mennonite Historical Society = After a one-year closure, Goshen College reopened in the fall of 1924 with a new vision for making the institution a center for the academic study of its denominational heritage in order to educate leaders for the future of the Mennonite Church. Young professors Harold S. Bender, Ernst Correll and Guy Hershberger were among those active in promoting the concurrent resurrection of the college's Mennonite Historical Society. Students, faculty and several alumni and friends were part of the reconstitution group's charter membership of 42 in 1924. Activities of the society and its leaders were key in transforming the MHL's several shelves of topically related material into a comprehensive resource for the study of Anabaptist-Mennonite history, life, and thought. Over the next five years, the society launched both its scholarly journal, The Mennonite Quarterly Review, and its monograph series, Studies in Anabaptist and Mennonite History. For the next quarter century, the society was the primary funding source for the growth of the MHL. = Building the collection = Throughout its history, the MHL has relied on a combination of donation and purchase to build its holdings. In June 1906, Goshen College received as a gift a 1534 Bible in the Zurich (Froschauer) translation long favored by the Swiss and South German Anabaptists over the more widespread Luther translation. One of the library's most prized pieces, the only known copy of the 1564 (first extant) edition of the Ausbund, an Anabaptist hymnal still used by the Amish, was purchased for $10 in 1928 in a Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, bookshop. From early on, the MHL holdings incorporated significant portions of earlier North American collections such as those assembled by Mennonite publisher and bishop John F. Funk and historian John Horsch, who collected books for his work with the Mennonite Publishing House and Mennonite Historical Committee. Later, portions of several European collections (e.g., Christian Hege of Germany and W.J. K√ºhler of the Netherlands) gave important depth to the library's holdings. Several printers and publishers have regularly donated deposit copies of their publications, notably Mennonite Publishing Network's Herald Press/Faith & Life Resources and Pathway Publishers (operated by Old Order Amish). Contributions have also been critical in the library's effort to sustain comprehensive acquisition of newly published material. Exchanges of material with sister collections, such as Bethel College's Mennonite Library and Archives (North Newton, Kansas), Eastern Mennonite University's Menno Simons Library (Harrisonburg, Virginia), and the Heritage Historical Library (Aylmer, Ontario), have helped broaden MHL holdings beyond the Swiss South-German Old Mennonite segment that continues to characterize their core strength. In addition to printed materials, the MHL collection has long included \\"objects of historical interest\\" - ranging from quilts to toys to furniture. Although at an earlier time the library also collected manuscript items, most of these are now under the care of the Mennonite Church USA Archives, long housed under a common roof with the MHL, and still located on the Goshen campus. The distinction between the Archives' collection of unpublished records and the MHL's focus on published material is easily lost on users‚Äîmany of whom benefit from visiting both collections. Close proximity of the two institutions clearly strengthens each collection. = Finding a home = In 1927, the MHL was removed from the general college library into its own room on the third floor of the Goshen College Administration Building; a short while later, it was moved into a larger, more accessible room on the first floor of the same building. In 1940, the MHL became the first occupant of Goshen College's newly constructed Memorial Library, with stacks and workspace separate from the main college library collection. The Archives was then located adjacent to the MHL, as it was also in 1960 when both moved to the new facility for Goshen Biblical Seminary (now known as Newcomer Center). In 1967, the MHL rejoined the college library in its current residence, the third floor of the Harold and Wilma Good Library. Today, the MHL occupies approximately 60 percent of the third floor. In addition to public space and a secure rare book room at the north end, portions of the collection are located in a storage area at the south end of the floor. A seminar room named in honor of historian John Horsch houses the 19th- and 20th-century works that were part of the collection Horsch formed at Scottdale, Pennsylvania. A current goal is to transform a work area into an artifact storage room. = Significant accomplishments = The MHL collection, now over 75,000 volumes, provides necessary material for a remarkable variety of individual academic pursuits-ranging from high school term papers to doctoral dissertations. Major corporate projects such as The Mennonite Encyclopedia, Hans J. Hillerbrand's Anabaptist Bibliography and Nelson P. Springer and A.J Klassen's Mennonite Bibliography relied heavily on access to the MHL's comprehensive collection of materials. In the 1980s, two successive grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) totaling more than $290,000 funded the professional recataloging of most of MHL's books. At the time, these grants were among the largest Goshen College had ever received. Work accomplished through the grant funding now allows for ready international access to information about MHL holdings through the catalog's on-line interface. In 1991, the MHL received another $57,000 NEH grant to microfilm early North American Mennonite periodicals and, in 1998, was awarded a $373,000 grant from Lilly Foundation Inc. to study Amish and Old Order groups in Indiana. Over the past 20 years, the MHL has supported a variety of exhibits featuring their own materials as well as items belonging to private or other museum collections. As a partner in the Martyrs Mirror Trust, the MHL collaborated with the Kauffman Museum (North Newton, Kansas) to launch a traveling exhibit based on martyr stories depicted in the texts and illustrations of the 1685 edition of Martyrs Mirror. Since 1990, the exhibit has appeared in more than 60 locations in 22 U.S. states and five Canadian provinces. In the Good Library Art Gallery, the MHL has helped mount more than a dozen exhibits that have served the campus and community. The diverse themes of these exhibits include toys and games, Amish crib quilts, Goshen College's centennial, one-person art shows, Fraktur (decorative writing), and furniture. = Constituency = The MHL continues to focus on the original vision of providing sources for the study of Anabaptist-Mennonite heritage and training young people continues. Staff members assist students and faculty of Goshen College, AMBS and other institutions along with independent researchers who wish to explore any topic related to Anabaptists, Mennonite and related groups.

They are split into two general categories: Kleinprofil (\\"small profile\\", used by the U1, U2, U3 and U4) and Gro√üprofil (\\"large profile\\", used by the U5, U6, U7, U8 and U9) lines. The names refer to the size of the train's coaches. Gro√üprofil coaches have a width of 2.65 metres and a height of 3.40 metres, and Kleinprofil coaches are only 2.30 metres wide and 3.10 metres high. Therefore, the trains have to operate on separate networks. Both networks have track and are electrified at 750 volts DC. Because Gro√üprofil and Kleinprofil trains use different types of power supply the trains cannot normally operate on the same route. However, on the Nord-S√ºd-Bahn in the years between 1923 and 1927 and on the E line (today's U5) between 1961 and 1978, Kleinprofil trains with specially adapted power pickups ran on Grossprofil tracks. They were fitted with special wooden boards on the sides to close the gap between platform and train. These wooden boards were jokingly called Blumenbretter (\\"flower boards\\"). The polarity of the power rails also differs. On the Kleinprofil lines the power rail is positively charged and the track is negative, on the Gro√üprofil lines it is the other way around. In East Berlin the polarity of the track section Th√§lmannplatz/Otto-Grotewohl-Stra√üe - Pankow, was the same as on the Gro√üprofil lines. After reunification, this exception to the normal Kleinprofil polarity was reversed by the BVG, even though there are benefits to this arrangement (there is less corrosion of metal parts in the tunnel with the Gro√üprofil polarity). The newest types of U-Bahn are I for the Gro√üprofil and Ik for the Kleinprofil. The oldest vehicles still in service are of the F74 type (Gro√üprofil) and the A3E type (Kleinprofil).

One of these vehicles was used by Wilhelm II in 1908, leading to their nickname Kaiserwagen (\\"emperor's coach\\"). The train width of 2.30 meters was already fixed at this point. At that time, trains and subways were still modelled on streetcars. The first production vehicles, which were appropriately titled A-I, were built in the Warschauer Br√ºcke workshop. At the U-Bahn's opening in 1902, 42 multiple units and 21 pure railroad cars were ready for service. Unlike the test vehicles, the seating was placed along the walls of the train, which was considered more comfortable. This arrangement is still used today. These trains had a top speed of . Between 1906 and 1913, a fifth batch of vehicles was delivered; these had an improved steering system, making possible 8-car trains, which had become necessary due to rising traffic. Originally there were smoking compartments and third class cars on the U-Bahn. Different classes were abandoned in 1927. In 1926 the Sch√∂neberg U-Bahn, which had been independent and had used their own vehicles up to that point, were taken over by the main U-Bahn network. Because a connection to the rest of the network had been planned from the beginning, the Sch√∂neberg trains had been built to the same specifications as the main network. From 1928 to 1929 a new type of Kleinprofil was introduced, the A-II cars. The most notable difference to the A-I type was that the A-II only had three windows and two sliding doors. Berliners called these trains Ammanullah-cars because the Afghan king Amanullah Khan had supposedly steered one of these trains during his 1928 Berlin visit. A A3L71 type U-Bahn A3 type cars After World War II a new batch of vehicles became necessary - the trains had been badly damaged in the war. At this point the new A3 type, modelled on its big Gro√üprofil brother DL, was designed. There were three batches of this type in the years 1960/61, 1964 and 1966. However, because these were built from steel, the new trains required a large amount of electricity. A3 trains have begun refurbishment for A3-64 and A3-66 from 2003 to 2006, known as A3E, but 8 trains were scrapped in 2000. Based on the A3, the A3L type built from aluminum was developed. G type cars While in West Berlin newer and newer vehicles were built and used, in East Berlin the pre-war A-I and A-II trains were still running. Finally, in 1975 the Th√§lmannplatz -- Pankow route got four prototypes of the new GI double multiple unit, called Gustav in popular parlance. As before, the seats were located alongside the train walls. The top speed was . The smallest unit of these trains were half trains made up of two double multiple units. After intensive testing the LEW Hennigsdorf factory began manufacturing the trains. The production models had lower side windows and a changed front, but were technically the same. 114 cars were built until 1982. There were 24 more, but those were delivered to Greece for a railway line there. They were returned to Berlin in 1984/85. The GII trains were returned to Athens in 1997. In 1988 a new batch of GI-trains was delivered, but with technical changes that made coupling them with the older cars impossible. Because of these changes the new trains were called GI/1. Their popular nickname was Gisela. A speciality of these cars was the fact that they had only two doors per side, unlike the other Kleinprofil trains, which had three. All the older G stock were sold to Pyongyang (GI), the G cars went for scrap, and all the GI/1 trains were refurbished into GI/1E from 2005 to 2007 in order to extend the lifespan. A A3L92 type train Interior of a HK type train HK type cars In allusion to the Gro√üprofil series H two prototypes were built in 2000, which had the designation HK - originally, the plan had been to call them A4. Unlike their Gro√üprofil model, cars on these trains are not fully inter-connected for passengers. A full train can be divided into two half trains. The production of the first train started in May 2005. On the U2 these new trains now represent a majority of trains run. They replaced all the A3L67 trains in 2007. Majority of the trains run on the U2, while some of them ran on the U1 if there is an emergency situation like trackworks or pullover and hardly any ran on the U3 and U4. IK type cars On August 2011, BVG announced an order of IK series in order to replace A3L71 stock which will be life expired. Two prototypes have been bought from Stadler Rail and the remaining 38 units to be delivered between 2015 and 2017. These trains are based on the Stadler Tango family of trams and light rail vehicles, but will resemble and function like a full-fledged subway train. The number '1xxx' will be jumped into '18Yxxx' (where Y is the train car number). Thanks to regenerative braking the trains will recuperate up to 20% of the energy they require. Two prototype 4-car sets were initially ordered. In 2015, a production order for 38 sets was placed which are scheduled to be delivered in 2017. These will replace the present A3L71 series. = Gro√üprofil = Today, only trains of the F and H types are in active service. { style=\\"float: right; margin-left: 0.6em; width: 33%\\" !colspan=\\"3\\" style=\\"background-color: #F0F0FF\\"Gro√üprofil train types - style=\\"background-color: #FFFFFF\\" style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"A-IK (Blumenbretter) style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"1923‚Äì1927 1945‚Äì1968 cars of the Kleinprofil type A-I - style=\\"background-color: #F8F8FF\\" style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"B I (Tunneleulen) style=\\"vertical- align: top\\"1924‚Äì1928 style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"improved train steering - style=\\"background-color: #FFFFFF\\" style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"B II style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"1927‚Äì1929 style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"a new batch of B-I cars - style=\\"background-color: #F8F8FF\\" style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"C I (Langwagen) style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"1926/1927 style=\\"vertical- align: top\\" - style=\\"background-color: #FFFFFF\\" style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"C II style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"1929 style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" - style=\\"background-color: #F8F8FF\\" style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"C III style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"1930 style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" - style=\\"background-color: #FFFFFF\\" style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"C IV style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"1930/1931 style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"test type - style=\\"background-color: #F8F8FF\\" style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"D (Stahldoras) style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"1955/1965 style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" - style=\\"background-color: #FFFFFF\\" style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"DL65 (Doras) style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"1965/1966 style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"built from poor metals - style=\\"background-color: #F8F8FF\\" style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"DL68 style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"1968‚Äì1970 style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" - style=\\"background-color: #FFFFFF\\" style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"DL70 style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"1970‚Äì1973 style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" - style=\\"background-color: #F8F8FF\\" style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"E I style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"1956/1957 style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"prototype - style=\\"background-color: #FFFFFF\\" style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"E III style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"1962‚Äì1990 style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" - style=\\"background-color: #F8F8FF\\" style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"F74 style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"1973‚Äì1975 style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" - style=\\"background-color: #FFFFFF\\" style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"F76 style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"1976‚Äì1978 style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" - style=\\"background-color: #F8F8FF\\" style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"F79 style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"1979‚Äì1981 style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" - style=\\";background-color: #FFFFFF\\" style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"F84 style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"1984-85 style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" - style=\\"background-color: #F8F8FF\\" style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"F87 style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"1986-88 style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" - style=\\"background-color: #FFFFFF\\" style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"F90 (J√§ger) style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"1990-91 style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" - style=\\"background-color: #F8F8FF\\" style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"F92 style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"1992-94 style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" - style=\\"background-color: #FFFFFF\\" style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"H95 style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"1994-95 style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" - style=\\"background-color: #F8F8FF\\" style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"H97/H98 style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"1997-99 style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" - style=\\"background-color: #FFFFFF\\" style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"H01 style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"2000‚Äì02 style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" - style=\\"background-color: #FFFFFF\\" style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"I style=\\"vertical-align: top\\"2014-2016 style=\\"vertical-align: top\\" } When the city of Berlin planned the new Nord- S√ºd-Bahn, it ordered two cars in the Gro√üprofil with a much greater width of 2.65 meters from the Linke-Hoffmann factory in Breslau. They were delivered in 1914 and put through trials by the Siemens company. The new cars with their bigger passenger capacity of 111 seats were intended to save money on the construction of platforms, because fewer cars were required to carry the passengers. This created a problem with platform access, which could only be solved in the 1950s and 1990s through enlargement of the platforms. For the U-Bahn of the AEG company, today's U8, two prototypes were ordered from the Cologne train factory van der Zypen & Charlier. They were built in 1916, but were never put into service. The Berlin train authority used the two trains from 1921 on, on a suburb route. B type cars Only after the 1920s German inflation was over Gro√üprofil cars could finally be ordered. In 1924, the first 16 multiple units and 8 normal passenger cars were delivered. Because they had big elliptical front windows, they were commonly called Tunneleulen (\\"tunnel owls\\"). The cars were 13.15 meters long and had 3 double sliding doors. This series was called BI. A BII type train on special service on the 75th anniversary of the U8 From 1927 to 1928, 20 further multiple units and 30 passenger cars were delivered to the Nord-S√ºd-Bahn AG. Because they had an improved propulsion system, they got the designation BII. They were all deployed to Line 6 and 8, before it was further redeployed in 1966 to Line 6. The last BI and BII trains were retired in the summer of 1969. C type cars As early as 1926, the first CI trains were trialed. They were 18 meters long and were tested thoroughly, before production started with the CII and CIII types. On the outside, CII and CIII trains were identical, but they were very different on the inside. The electricity driving the train was routed directly through the steering in the CII (\\"Schaltwerksteuerung\\"), while the CIII used the safer \\"Sch√ºtzensteuerung\\" (with only a weak control current running through the controls). In 1930 the first CIV cars were delivered. For the first time, aluminum was used as a construction material. This way, weight could be reduced by 12%. Especially these CIV cars, but also some CII and CIII trains were seized by the Soviet occupation forces in 1945, which were stationed in the Friedrichsfelde workshop at that time. The trains were transported to Moscow and were used in the Metro until 1966. Interior of a DL train D and DL type cars After World War II the trains of the Berlin U-Bahn were worn out, making a new series of trains necessary. From 1957 on the new D type trains were delivered (also called Stahldora/Steel Dora). They were made of steel, making them very heavy. In 1965, the DL type was developed, which was constructed from lighter metals (also called Dora). This way, weight was reduced by 26%. Like in earlier types the seats were located along the sides of the train. E type cars, transportation of cars to Moscow In East Berlin, the vehicle situation was poor. Because the C-trains had been transported to Moscow as stated above, there were no Gro√üprofil trains left for the Line E. So, just like in the beginning years of the Gro√üprofil, Kleinprofil vehicles with boards attached to the sides were used. These trains had the designation AI K. 40 trains were being re-deployed to the Line E after the war. These \\"Blumenbratter\\" trains were also deployed on Line D on the Workers' Uprising and the Berlin strike in 1953. The actual last day of service was on 16 July 1994. A F92 type train F type cars In West Berlin, the new F type followed the D and DL types. These trains were longer, built from light metal and had a different seating arrangement, with the two double seats at 90 degrees to the sides of the train. A test vehicle was built in 1973; it was scrapped in December 2006. A H type train H type cars In the meanwhile, the F type had become quite old-fashioned, and the BVG decided to commission another new type. A train with completely joined compartments was chosen, and the seats along the car walls returned. This type was called H. In 1995 the first prototypes (H95) were delivered to the BVG. In 1998 and 2000 further batches (H97 and H01) were ordered from Adtranz. The interior was mainly painted white and yellow. The cars can only be uncoupled in a depot. These trains are manufactured by Bombardier Transportation. Today, all H type cars ran on almost all lines. I type cars The BVG meanwhile awarded the I trains to Stadler Rail in 2014 and were delivered in 2016-19. Two prototype 4-car sets were initially ordered. In 2015, a production order for 64 sets was placed which are scheduled to be delivered in 2017-2021. These will replace the present D57/D60 units currently running on U55, as well as F74, F76 and F79 units that runs on U5, U7 and U8, and also expand the fleet for the U5 extension.

Career ≈†antiƒá gained initial success in tuna fishing, having grown up in Port Lincoln. His early exploits in the fishing industry also included fishing for orange roughy in a leaky boat called the Vigorous off the coast of Tasmania. He went on to establish \\"Tony's Tuna International\\" in 1994. In the early 1990s, ≈†antiƒá suffered financial hardship after tuna quotas were reduced twice. The tuna industry and a number of related businesses suffered while others shut down entirely. Santic's business survived, and by 1996 it had grown to include tuna ranching operations in Mexico, the Mediterranean and Port Lincoln. The development of ranching turned the tuna industry around, and Tony's Tuna International became one of the three largest tuna ranching operations in Port Lincoln. In 1997, ≈†antiƒá decided to pursue his interest in horse racing, which ultimately led to three Melbourne Cup victories courtesy of a horse he named Makybe Diva. ≈†antiƒá featured in the BRW Rich List in 2003, with an estimated personal wealth of $200 million. Fellow Port Lincoln tuna ranchers Sam Sarin and Hagen Stehr also featured on the list. By 2005, ≈†antiƒá's horse Makybe Diva had won back-to-back Melbourne Cup races, and according to Robert Skeffington, editor of the BRW Rich List, ≈†antiƒá was worth $150 million. In January 2010, an ammonia cylinder exploded at ≈†antiƒá's tuna processing facility, destroying a shed and releasing ammonia gas into the atmosphere. No-one was injured during the explosion and ≈†antiƒá was out fishing at the time of the event. Safework SA announced that they would investigate the incident. In 2012, ≈†antiƒá's company, \\"Tony's Tuna International\\", initiated plans to trial an alternative ranching regime involving the capture of younger, smaller fish, and extending ranching time from six to 18 months. The initiative planned to make better use of the quota system, which allocates a total allowable catch to license holders, measured in tonnes. Later that year, ≈†antiƒá and his wife Deslee became victims of fraud. The Adelaide newspaper The Advertiser was informed that $700,000 had been siphoned out of their business interests and that a 33-year-old Torquay man was under police investigation. As of 2015, ≈†antiƒá remains the CEO of \\"Tony's Tuna International\\". = Oceanic Victor Pty Ltd = In 2015, South Australian Environment minister Ian Hunter revealed that ≈†antiƒá was a director of Oceanic Victor Pty Ltd, a company with an active business proposal for Granite Island. With fellow director Michael \\"Mick\\" Dyer (who is also ≈†antiƒá's Tuna International's Operations Manager) and long-term friend and advisor Emma Forster, the company intends to offer offshore marine tourism opportunities for visitors to the Victor Harbor area. The company proposes to use the kiosk at Granite Island as a departure point, from which tourists will be taken by boat to an offshore facility where they will be able to feed and swim with fish, and watch them from and underwater observatory. Personal life ≈†antiƒá came to Australia with his family in 1958, aged six. His parents lived in Geelong, Victoria, for the next eight years, after which Tony and his mother moved to Port Lincoln, South Australia. In 1996, about nine years after the death from Hodgkin's disease of his first wife, Sonya, ≈†antiƒá married Christine, his family's former cleaning lady. The couple shared three Melbourne Cup victories together with their racehorse, Makybe Diva. In 2006 ≈†antiƒá and his wife separated, with the divorce being finalised in 2008, involving the carve-up of his $200 million business. On 25 April 2009, he married his third wife, Deslee Kennedy, who had been his media manager. ≈†antiƒá has three children, Emily ≈†antiƒá, born to his first wife, Sonya, Joseph ≈†antiƒá, born on 8 March 1989 to his second wife, Christine, and Charli Rose, born in October 2009 to his third wife.

They are also referred to as simply Nyaw or Yaw, depending on either the Lao, Isan, and Nyaw pronunciation, which all pronounce the initial consonant as , or the Thai pronunciation, which pronounces the initial consonant as . History The Tai Nyaw believe that they are descendants of people originally from the northernmost part of Laos and Tonkin or immigrants during Tai migrations. Whatever the case may be, their dialect most closely resembles the Lao dialects from the regions east of Luang Prabang. Legend has it descendants are from the old king of Laos, who migrated after the overthrow and was forced to leave and spread out to neighboring countries for refuge. The Nyaw believed their ancestors are the king's personal guards and extended family. Language The Nyaw language is very similar to the Lao language, which is referred to as the Isan language in Thailand. It is most similar to the Phuthai language also spoken within the same regions. Most Nyaw are often also fluent in Thai and Lao. Religion The Tai Nyaw practise Theravada Buddhism, but have also maintained their original animist religion. Important to the Nyaw people is the tutelary spirit of the village, known in the dialect as ‡∏ú‡∏π‡πâ‡πÄ‡∏à‡πâ‡∏≤ . Status In Thailand this language group is increasingly becoming integrated into the mainstream Isan language. This is due in large part to a campaign by the Thai government to modernize all Thai people, as well as due to outside influences of television, internet and local radio broadcasts. Most younger members of this northeastern tribal group in Thailand prefer to be called Thai rather than by their traditional tribal group name. Headhunters Believed to be Nyaw indigenous headhunters who sought other tribes for bounty and sport, It was an honor to retrieve the heads of rival tribes as a trophy. Many traditional families still kept the severed skulls as charms and for use in Black Magic known as \\"Kong Dee\\". After the integration of Lao, Thai and Cambodian mainstream society the head hunts were deemed unacceptable.

It is also known as Cori's disease in honor of the 1947 Nobel laureates Carl Cori and Gerty Cori. Other names include Forbes disease in honor of clinician Gilbert Burnett Forbes (1915‚Äì2003), an American physician who further described the features of the disorder, or limit dextrinosis, due to the limit dextrin-like structures in cytosol. Limit dextrin is the remaining polymer produced after hydrolysis of glycogen. Without glycogen debranching enzymes to further convert these branched glycogen polymers to glucose, limit dextrinosis abnormally accumulates in the cytoplasm. Glycogen is a molecule the body uses to store carbohydrate energy. Symptoms of GSD-III are caused by a deficiency of the enzyme amylo-1,6 glucosidase, or debrancher enzyme. This causes excess amounts of an abnormal glycogen to be deposited in the liver, muscles and, in some cases, the heart. Signs and symptoms Glycogen storage disease type III presents during infancy with hypoglycemia and failure to thrive. Clinical examination usually reveals hepatomegaly. Muscular disease, including hypotonia and cardiomyopathy, usually occurs later. The liver pathology typically regresses as the individual enter adolescence, as does splenomegaly, should the individual so develop it. Genetics GSD III is AR In regards to genetics glycogen storage disease type III is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern (which means both parents need be a carrier), and occurs in about 1 of every 100,000 live births. The highest incidence of glycogen storage disease type III is in the Faroe Islands where it occurs in 1 out of every 3,600 births, probably due to a founder effect. There seem to be two mutations in exon 3 (c.17_18delAG) being one of them, which are linked to the subtype IIIb. The amylo-alpha-1, 6-glucosidase, 4-alpha-glucanotransferase gene and mutations to it, are at the root of this condition. The gene is responsible for creating glycogen debranching enzyme, which in turn helps in glycogen decomposition. Diagnosis In terms of the diagnosis for glycogen storage disease type III, the following tests/exams are carried out to determine if the individual has the condition: * Biopsy (muscle or liver) * CBC * Ultrasound * DNA mutation analysis (helps ascertain GSD III subtype) =Differential diagnosis= The differential diagnosis of glycogen storage disease type III includes GSD I, GSD IX and GSD VI. This however does not mean other glycogen storage diseases should not be distinguished as well.update 2012 =Classification= Clinical manifestations of glycogen storage disease type III are divided into four classes: * GSD IIIa, is the most common, (along with GSD IIIb) and which clinically includes muscle and liver involvement * GSD IIIb, which clinically has liver involvement but no muscle involvement * GSD IIIc which clinically affects liver and muscle. * GSD IV affects liver only (not muscle) Treatment Glucose Treatment for glycogen storage disease type III may involve a high-protein diet, in order to facilitate gluconeogenesis. Additionally the individual may need: * IV glucose (if oral route is inadvisable) * Nutritional specialist * Vitamin D (for osteoporosis/secondary complication) * Hepatic transplant (if complication occurs) References Further reading External links * Autosomal recessive disorders Hepatology Inborn errors of carbohydrate metabolism ","title":"Glycogen storage disease type III"},{"id":"2975403","text":"John \\"Picayune\\" Butler (died 1864) was a black French singer and banjo player who lived in New Orleans, Louisiana.

There is one Kleinprofil and three Gro√üprofil depots. The depots are divided into Hauptwerkst√§tten (Hw, \\"main depots\\") and Betriebswerkst√§tten (Bw, \\"service depots\\"). Service depots only handle minor repairs and maintenance like changing the windows or removing graffiti. Main depots are used for the full inspections scheduled every few years. Lifting the trains off the tracks is only possible in the main depots. Depots = Grunewald main and service depot = Part of the maintenance complex Grunewald The Grunewald depot is the only Kleinprofil depot with the exception of the Hw Seestra√üe, a Gro√üprofil depot also used for Kleinprofil trains. The depot, which opened on January 21, 1913, is directly adjacent to the overground U-Bahn station Olympia-Stadion. In 1913, the depot was constructed with one service building, in the following years three more buildings were added: Halle II (1924/25), Halle III (1926) and Halle IV (1927). In World War II, a large part of the complex burned down following an air raid on September 3, 1943. Reconstruction was finished in 1950, along with the rest of the U-Bahn network. In Berlin U-Bahn jargon the depot is called Bw Gru or Hw Gru. =Seestra√üe main and service depot= The Seestra√üe depot was opened in 1923, because the new Gro√üprofil line C (now the U6) needed a workshop. It is located north of the Seestra√üe U-Bahn station. There are 17 tracks here, with two for the main depot and 15 for the service depot, one of which leads to the cleaning area. Because space is limited and the complex cannot be expanded due to its location in the inner city, it is planned to tear down parts of the workshop. Due to budget cuts by the BVG in 2003, Kleinprofil vehicles are serviced in Seestra√üe as well. The U-Bahn jargon shorthand for this installation is Bw See or Hw See. =Friedrichsfelde service depot= Wagenhalle II of the service depot Friedrichsfelde Alongside the construction of the Berlin U-Bahn line E (now U5), the service depot Friedrichsfelde was built from 1927 to 1930. The depot is located in the vicinity of the Tierpark U-Bahn station. The buildings I and II, built in 1930, were among the most modern in the U-Bahn system at that time. It was used for East Berlin Kleinpofil trains, because the east had no Kleinprofil depot. In 1993, when the eastern and western networks were reconnected, this finally changed. The shorthand for the depot is Bw Fi. =Britz-S√ºd service depot= The service depot in Britz Because there were more and more Gro√üprofil lines built in West Berlin, it became necessary to think about new depots. Because the extension of the U7 to Rudow was being built at the time, building the depot there was the logical choice. Construction began in 1969 and was finished in 1971. Because the area bought was quite large with 100,000 m¬≤, further expansion was considered from the beginning. In 1988 an extension building for the service workshop was finished. It is the newest and most modern of Berlin's U-Bahn depot. The U-Bahn jargon shorthand for it is Bw Britz.

Gillies was born at Overnewton near Glasgow, Scotland, where his father had a market garden. He was sent to the high school until he was about 14, when he entered an office in Glasgow. In 1852, he arrived in Melbourne and travelled to the goldfields at Ballarat, where he worked first as a miner and later as a businessman and company director. Gillies was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly for Ballarat West in 1861, holding that seat until 1868. A conservative, he was President of the Board of Lands and Works in the short- lived government of Charles Sladen in 1868, which cost him his seat at Ballarat, a strongly liberal constituency. He was elected for Maryborough 1870‚Äì77, Rodney 1877‚Äì89, Eastern Suburbs 1889‚Äì94 and Toorak 1897‚Äì1903. He was Commissioner for Railways and Roads in the ministries of James Francis and George Kerferd from 1872 to 1875, and Agriculture Minister in the third government of Sir James McCulloch in 1875‚Äì77. In both the first (1880) and second (1883‚Äì86) governments of Service, Gillies was Commissioner for Railways and Vice-President of the Board of Land and Works. He was also Minister for Public Instruction 1884‚Äì86. As Railways Minister, he proved to be amenable to lobbying from members of parliament and others, initiating the 1884 Railway Construction Act (nicknamed the Octopus Act) which extravagantly authorised the building of 59 new rail lines. He also assisted the passage of a bill to allow the Melbourne Tramway and Omnibus Company monopoly rights to operate a cable tram network in the city and suburbs. Service retired before the 1886 elections and Gillies succeeded him as Premier, forming a coalition government with the liberal leader Alfred Deakin, and winning a comfortable majority over a divided opposition at the elections. The Gillies ministry presided over the climax of the long economic boom which Victoria had enjoyed since the gold rushes of the 1850s. The great Victorian Land Boom took off in late 1880s and reached a climax in 1890. There was no regulation of the banking and finance industries at that time, and no expectation that governments could or should protect investors against unsound or unscrupulous financial schemes. More than 50 million pounds of speculative capital from Britain flowed into the colony, much of which was spent buying land in suburban Melbourne at hugely inflated prices. Gillies was not himself responsible for that, although his government did nothing to prevent it. The Gillies government was easily re-elected in 1889, but the Boom collapsed after 1890 and a sharp recession followed. In October, Gillies was defeated in a confidence motion when a section of his own followers led by James Munro turned against him. In 1891, the recession turned into a depression, and Gillies was among the many speculators and shareholders who were wiped out in the crash. In 1893, Gillies withdrew from active politics, reluctantly accepting the post of agent-general in London. On his return to Victoria, he successfully contested the seat of Toorak in 1897. In 1902, he was elected Speaker, a post he held until his death the following year. He had always been considered to be a bachelor but, after his death, it was disclosed that, in 1897, he had married Harriett Turquand Fillan (n√©e Theobald), a widow of 37, while in London. She had been persuaded by Gillies' friends to return to her nursing in Johannesburg without announcing herself to Melbourne society. He had declined the offer of a K.C.M.G. in 1887. A portrait of Gillies by Josephine Muntz-Adams hangs in Parliament House Victoria.

According to Bree, \\"I heard Heather‚Äôs voice before I met her. My cousin had recorded her band Yoko and I thought she had a great natural voice, no silly effected delivery. I was looking for a girl to sing on some duets I had written so I tracked down her number and asked her to come see my band play.\\" The band independently released its first recording Mars Loves Venus EP in 1998. In 2002 Bree founded Lil' Chief Records with fellow indie pop musician Scott Mannion of The Tokey Tones. The two men had met that year in Marbecks Record Store in Auckland, where Bree was working at the time. The Brunettes' album Holding Hands, Feeding Ducks released in 2002 was the debut release for the label. This was followed 6 months later by the mini-album The Boyracer EP. The label set up headquarters in an Auckland flat dubbed 'The Ghetto.' Its rooms and graffiti- lined garage became a regular rehearsal space for the band, as well as a recording studio for many of the band's future releases. Their second album Mars Loves Venus was released in June 2004 again on Lil' Chief and was quickly followed by 2005's EP When Ice Met Cream. In 2004, Ryan McPhun moved to Auckland from California and started playing in The Brunettes and other Lil' Chief bands. The band opened for The Shins 2005 tour of North America. They have also opened for Rilo Kiley, The Postal Service, Broken Social Scene, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, and Beirut and played at the 2006 Big Day Out festivals in New Zealand and Australia.

Quantum optics In quantum optics, superradiance is a phenomenon that occurs when a group of N emitters, such as excited atoms, interact with a common light field. If the wavelength of the light is much greater than the separation of the emitters, then the emitters interact with the light in a collective and coherent fashion. This causes the group to emit light as a high intensity pulse (with rate proportional to N2). This is a surprising result, drastically different from the expected exponential decay (with rate proportional to N) of a group of independent atoms (see spontaneous emission). Superradiance has since been demonstrated in a wide variety of physical and chemical systems, such as quantum dot arrays and J-aggregates. The effect has recently been used to produce a superradiant laser. Rotational superradiance Rotational superradiance is associated with the acceleration or motion of a nearby body (which supplies the energy and momentum for the effect). It is also sometimes described as the consequence of an \\"effective\\" field differential around the body (e.g. the effect of tidal forces). This allows a body with a concentration of angular or linear momentum to move towards a lower energy state, even when there is no obvious classical mechanism for this to happen. In this sense, the effect has some similarities with quantum tunnelling (e.g. the tendency of waves and particles to \\"find a way\\" to exploit the existence of an energy potential, despite the absence of an obvious classical mechanism for this to happen). * In classical physics, the motion or rotation of a body in a particulate medium will normally be expected to result in momentum and energy being transferred to the surrounding particles, and there is then an increased statistical likelihood of particles being discovered following trajectories that imply removal of momentum from the body. * In quantum mechanics, this principle is extended to the case of bodies moving, accelerating or rotating in a vacuum ‚Äì in the quantum case, quantum fluctuations with appropriate vectors are said to be stretched and distorted and provided with energy and momentum by the nearby body's motion, with this selective amplification generating real physical radiation around the body. Where a classical description of a rotating isolated weightless sphere in a vacuum will tend to say that the sphere will continue to rotate indefinitely, due to the lack of frictional effects or any other form of obvious coupling with its smooth empty environment, under quantum mechanics the surrounding region of vacuum is not entirely smooth, and the sphere's field can couple with quantum fluctuations and accelerate them to produce real radiation. Hypothetical virtual wavefronts with appropriate paths around the body are stimulated and amplified into real physical wavefronts by the coupling process. Descriptions sometimes refer to these fluctuations \\"tickling\\" the field to produce the effect. In theoretical studies of black holes, the effect is also sometimes described as the consequence of the gravitational tidal forces around a strongly gravitating body pulling apart virtual particle pairs that would otherwise quickly mutually annihilate, to produce a population of real particles in the region outside the horizon. The black hole bomb is an exponentially growing instability in the interaction between a massive bosonic field and a rotating black hole. Astrophysics and relativity In astrophysics, a potential example of superradiance is Zel'dovich radiation. It was Yakov Zel'dovich who first described this effect in 1971, Igor Novikov at the University of Moscow further developed the theory. Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich picked the case under quantum electrodynamics (\\"QED\\") where the region around the equator of a spinning metal sphere is expected to throw off electromagnetic radiation tangentially, and suggested that the case of a spinning gravitational mass, such as a Kerr black hole ought to produce similar coupling effects, and ought to radiate in an analogous way. This was followed by arguments from Stephen Hawking and others that an accelerated observer near a black hole (e.g. an observer carefully lowered towards the horizon at the end of a rope) ought to see the region inhabited by \\"real\\" radiation, whereas for a distant observer this radiation would be said to be \\"virtual\\". If the accelerated observer near the event horizon traps a nearby particle and throws it out to the distant observer for capture and study, then for the distant observer, the appearance of the particle can be explained by saying that the physical acceleration of the particle has turned it from a virtual particle into a \\"real\\" particle (see Hawking radiation). Similar arguments apply for the cases of observers in accelerated frames (Unruh radiation). Cherenkov radiation, electromagnetic radiation emitted by charged particles travelling through a particulate medium at more than the nominal speed of light in that medium, has also been described as \\"inertial motion superradiance\\". Additional examples of superradiance in astrophysical environments include the study of radiation flares in maser-hosting regions and fast radio bursts . Evidence of superradiance in these settings suggests the existence of intense emissions from entangled quantum mechanical states, involving a very large number of molecules, ubiquitously present across the universe and spanning large distances (e.g. from a few kilometres in the interstellar medium to possibly over several billion kilometres ).

Cale-Oosha, the ruler of Tyrus, looks into his uncle's project with Earth. However, his uncle, The Dragit, claims that their dying planet ought to invade Earth and take hold of its resources. Cale refuses, and a civil war breaks out. Cale and Rafe, his bodyguard, trainer, and trusted friend, escape to Earth, disguising themselves as humans. Cale meets Rita Carter, a human woman; he falls in love with her, and they marry. After a long time of running from the Dragit's forces on Earth, Cale returns to Tyrus to help strengthen his loyalist forces, the Ooshati, leaving Rita and their young son, David, under Rafe's protection. In the present day, when the Dragit finally finds the family, he is determined to kill them, and David Carter's teenage life is thrown into a devastating adventure of stopping the Dragit, losing and gaining friends, and finding out just who he is.  Characters  * David Carter (Oosha) (voiced by Mikey Kelley) - The main character of the story, a teenage half-human Tyrusian and the future ruler of Tyrus. David lost his house, his mother and his possessions, and learned the truth of his identity all in one night. Possessing royalty in his blood, he discovers he can harness his Tyrusian powers. However, this is difficult for him to do of his own accord so he needs the help of the Exotar, a glove that enhances these powers. * Rafe (voiced by Edward Albert) ‚Äì Somewhat like an uncle to David, he goes undercover as a county sheriff in Glenport, but is, in reality, a commander in the Ooshati forces. Rafe was told by Cale, his friend and king, to watch over David and his mother. Only a day after he rescues David from a group of captors, he is asked to lead an attack on the Dragit's headquarters on Earth. After this successful attack, during which all other involved Ooshati were killed, Rafe succumbs to wounds inflicted by a stowaway Mangler. Right before he dies, he gives encouragement to David and passes on the task of saving the world. * Rita Carter (Ooshala) (voiced by Kath Soucie) ‚Äì David's human mother. She is a kind woman who saved Cale from death and eventually married him. When a group of Tall Men invade her house, Rita holds them at bay with a gun while she tells David to get out of the house. The orb Cale gave to her before his departure years ago suddenly activates during this ordeal and, shortly thereafter, the house implodes, and Rita and the Tall Men disappear with it. As of now, her fate is still uncertain. * Cale-Oosha (voiced by Lorenzo Lamas) ‚Äì David's Tyrusian father, and the true ruler of Tyrus. After a few years of staying on the run, he leaves his family under Rafe's protection to help his band of loyalist forces, known as the Ooshati, in their war against the Dragit. * The Dragit (voiced by Tony Jay) ‚Äì The lead antagonist of the story, and David's great-uncle. He currently has control over much of the Tyrusian armed forces, and is figured as a great orator and dictator, possibly having almost complete control over Tyrus. Although this is uncertain, his forces appear far larger and sophisticated than the ragged band of Ooshati. Throughout the story, the Dragit tries to brainwash David into joining his side or to have him killed. * Major Philip 'Phil' Stark (voiced by Greg Eagles) ‚Äì An intelligence officer and pilot of an OH-6A Cayuse. He has a heart for David and cares for his safety, going around his orders to help him out. Stark's original search started with the discovery of a Mangler skeleton in a cave where Rafe's fingerprints were found. He was also once school buddies with the President of the United States. * Sergeant Angela \\"Angie\\" Romar (voiced by Kristy McNichol) ‚Äì Stark's partner and friend. Proud of her Gypsy heritage and a brave young woman, she accompanies Stark wherever he goes. Romar is also the one who usually plants the ideas and advice into Stark's head. The two agents at one point hid David in her apartment. * Jim Bailey (voiced by Rider Strong) ‚Äì David's best friend. He helped support David through some of his toughest trials, and eventually went with him into outer space on the final mission of the story. * Doc (voiced by Ronny Cox) ‚Äì A Tyrusian once positioned in Charles Air Force Base, he deserted upon hearing of the Dragit's attempt to assassinate Cale and \\"went native.\\" Now an old man living in the middle of the Utah desert, Doc initially stayed away from any involvement in the war against the Dragit. However, knowing what David was up against and seeing his spirit, he eventually changed his mind and tapped into the Dragit's information network, becoming a big help in the final mission. * Blue ‚Äì Doc's pet Mangler. Like Doc, Blue is a survivor of the attempted assassination of Cale-Oosha. Doc tamed Blue, who has quite an appetite for steaks. Though Doc believed that Blue only cared for the meat, Blue nearly attacks and is shot by a police officer who assaulted Doc. Later, while hiding in the Florida swamps, Blue hunted alligators for Doc to cook for David and his companions. * General Konrad (voiced by Leonard Nimoy) ‚Äì The first main antagonist as the show begins, a Tyrusian who has risen to the rank of an Air Force general. He is the leader of the Dragit's agents on Earth. Konrad is a seemingly heartless man who releases Manglers on his own men in an attempt to kill Ooshati warriors. After the destruction of Charles Air Force Base, he tries to kill David and Rafe, but David is successful in turning the situation around. As a direct result, Konrad dies in a plane crash. * General Gordon (voiced by James Sikking) ‚Äì Once a colonel, he is promoted after General Konrad is killed. Gordon directs Stark and Romar's missions when the two agents become suspicious. Later, it is confirmed that he led the attack on Maple Island to capture David and Rafe. Gordon also ordered his men to shoot down Stark and Romar's OH-6A Cayuse when the two attempted their own investigation. When the space shuttle lifted off for the moon, he tried to follow in a stealth fighter and shoot it down, but flew too high for the fighter to take and fell back to Earth. Gordon is presumed dead. * Major Lomack (voiced by Jim Cummings) ‚Äì An alien humanoid from the planet Chaon with the ability to morph into a hulking, fearsome creature as well as imitate other beings, including humans. When in his real form, Lomack is relatively immune to bullets and other weapons. * Simon Lear (voiced by Thom Adcox- Hernandez) ‚Äì A human/Tyrusian hybrid like David, he and his sister are bounty hunters working for General Gordon who attempts to capture David. He and his sister are their mother's only successful attempt at blending the two species DNA. He has a hissing voice and an anger management problem, often resorting to killing without thought. After losing a fight to David, Simon takes Jim hostage and threatens to kill him, convincing David to come with him and Sonia. He then tries to kill David by enhancing his Tyrusian powers using the Exotar, but the Exotar twists and crushes his hand, just as Rafe warned would happen, if any but the rightful heir attempted to wear it. * Sonia Lear (voiced by Kath Soucie) ‚Äì Simon's twin sister, a human/Tyrusian hybrid like David and fellow bounty hunter, also after David. She keeps Simon under control through Tyrusian psychic bonding; in turn, she loses her nerve and sense of violence without him. While hiding from security on an island to board a space shuttle to the moon, Simon tries to help General Gordon find the group by coming back into contact with his sister, but Sonia, now helping David and his friends, leads them away. Is implied to have romantic feelings for David. * Dr. Hazel Lear ‚Äì Sonia and Simon's \\"mother,\\" a geneticist who, for years, tried to combine the genes of Tyrusians and humans with mostly failed results. Unable to wait any longer, General Gordon orders Major Lomack to kill her as a hidden Sonia watches in safety.  Episodes  Invasion America consisted of 13 half-hour episodes, and was shown as five one-hour segments and one hour-and-a-half segment for the final episode. * \\"The Legend\\" (\\"The Legend\\"/\\"The Son\\") (June 8, 1998) * \\"Assault\\" (\\"Flight\\"/\\"Assault\\") (June 9, 1998) * \\"Renewal\\" (\\"Renewal\\"/\\"Home\\") (June 16, 1998) * \\"Capture\\" (\\"Capture\\"/\\"The Trip\\") (June 23, 1998) * \\"Friendly Fire\\" (\\"Allies\\"/\\"Charade\\") (June 30, 1998) * \\"Final Mission\\" (\\"Rendezvous\\"/\\"Countdown\\"/\\"Dark Side\\") (July 7, 1998)  Reception  The show received a mixed reception from critics. Howard Rosenberg of The Los Angeles Times gave the show a largely negative review, criticizing the writing and \\"thin plot\\". Anita Gates of The New York Times noted that the animation was \\"impressive\\", but at the same time that \\"there's no heart in it\\". The Sun Sentinel wrote that the cartoon leaves viewers bored, while in a mostly positive review Entertainment Weekly stated \\"Invasion is at least as involving as any of the current variations on Star Trek, and handsomer to look at than all of them. B+\\".  Versions  DreamWorks released two versions, one being edited for younger audiences. In addition, the story of Invasion America was never completed, with the series ending with the words \\"End of Book One.\\"  Novels  Two novels, specifically an adaptation of the series titled Invasion America and an original prequel novel titled Invasion America: On the Run, have been written in the show's setting. Both were written by Christie Golden.

The bourrelet is identified by the white line around the circumference of this mortar projectile. No rotating band is required for use in an unrifled mortar. The bourrelet is the portion of an elongated artillery projectile having a very slightly smaller diameter than the interior diameter of the barrel through which that projectile is to be propelled. The bourrelet is typically precisely machined to a specified diameter after the remainder of the cast projectile body has been roughly machined to a smaller diameter. The bourrelet is normally forward of a rotating band or driving band near the aft end of the projectile. The rotating or driving band is customarily made of a softer metal than the remainder of the artillery projectile and of a larger diameter than the bourrelet to seal the barrel and be engraved by the rifling to spin- stabilize the projectile in flight. The bourrelet is not engraved by the rifling, but is supported by the lands between the rifling to align the long axis of the projectile with the axis of the artillery bore. sabot, supporting the front of the projectile Examples The bourrelet bearing surface generally has a longitudinal width of about one-sixth caliber machined with a smooth surface to reduce friction wear of the rifling lands. If the bourrelet diameter is not a close fit, the in-bore yaw angle will affect the stability of a projectile during flight. However, excessive pressures may be generated within an artillery barrel attempting to fire a cast steel projectile with a bourrelet diameter lacking clearance to pass irregularities within the artillery barrel. The distance between the bourrelet and the rotating or driving band is typically at least one bore diameter to prevent wobbling, and greater distances reduce perpendicular force required for equivalent alignment. In the case of a sub-caliber projectile, such as an armor-piercing round, a sabot surrounds the sub-caliber portion, with driving bands at the rear and the bourrelet supporting the front, aligning the armor-piercing portion with the center of the barrel of the gun.

Gameplay In Romancing SaGa 2, the player plays as the Emperor or Empress of Avalon, a castle located in the northwest corner of the game's world map. The Treasurer, in the throne room, tells the player the fund reserve in his or her castle treasury. Development of new equipment and spells, and establishment of services in Avalon will consume funds. The Treasurer also fills the Emperor with walking about funds if the player needs it. Also in the throne room is the Accountant. He tells the player how much money he or she collects per battle. When the player controls more land on the map, the amount increases. In the southeast corner of the throne room is the Chancellor. He tells the player what problems need to be solved in the world and where to solve them. Solving the problems he points out aids the player to advance to the next generation. The Fighters are the default characters that join the player early in the game. They are not the best characters, but as the player advances through the game, he or she will get other characters who specialize in areas that the Fighters are weak in. The Formation Soldiers demonstrate any battle formations the player happens to know and will collaborate with the player to make new formations. If the heir the player chooses knows a formation, it is recommended that the player consult the Formation Soldiers. Throughout the game the player will be able to expand the capital. They will not appear until the player cleared a generation though after accepting the offers to start the public works. Plot =Story= The Emperor or Empress of Avalon begins the game as King Leon and later plays as his various heirs down through the game years. Leon hands his kingdom over to his son, Gerard. At the end of Gerard's reign, the player is able to choose his or her own successor and pass on Gerard's abilities to them. At the end of each generation, he or she will be given a choice of four heirs. Their identity is based on a combination of chance and anyone whom the player has assisted or allied within in a past generation. =Characters= Major characters: * Bard: A recurring character throughout the SaGa series, he begins the game by rekindling the tale of the Empire of Avalon and the battle of the Seven Heroes. * Waib: The woman who gifted the Avalon Dynasty with Inheritance magic. * : The First Emperor of Avalon, killed by Kzinssie during a retaliation against him. * : Leon's eldest son, killed by Kzinssie during his assault on Avalon. * : Youngest son of Leon; becomes Emperor after defeating Kzinssie. * : A scientist who lives in Somon. * : An android that resides in Somon a few generations after Kzinssie is defeated. She can only be used once in the game, so it must be chosen carefully when to recruit her. * : Ruler of Douglas of Cumberland. * : King Harold's eldest son; leads the Holy Order in Nerack. * : King Harold's daughter; leads the Holy Order in Forfar. * : Youngest son of King Harold. * : Lord that rules Chontou Castle; forms a pact with Wagnas. * : Retainer to Lord Ato. * : The culmination of the Avalon Dynasty's Inheritance magic. At the start of the game he/she will be at the same bar where the bard retells the Empire's battle against the Seven Heroes. The main villains of the game are the Seven Heroes who saved the world from a great and terrible evil, then vanished without a trace for centuries, before returning all turned into demons. The Avalon royal family fights them through successive generations, defeating them one-by-one: *: A floating demon with a scarf covering his face, wielding a sword. Can steal life energy or souls. Defeated by Gerard, he returns in the Final Scenario with an even more grotesque appearance than when first met. *: A hero with both angelic and butterfly-like characteristics, the feminine-looking Lord Wagnas is actually male. He enslaves the Iris race to do his bidding, and resides in a floating castle above the Eastern Kingdom. *: With features reminiscent of both elephants and sauropods as well as that of the mythical centaur, Lord Dantarg is one of the most physically powerful of the Seven Heroes. He terrorizes the migratory clans, and prefers devastating physical attacks, including Grand Slam. He is also the only hero with four different forms, depending on the time in which the character fights him. *: A puppeteer demon with an elderly appearance, Bokhohn is in control of the majority of the Seven Heroes' forces. Situated in the Steppes region, he owns a large landship, complete with innumerable slaves. His special technique allows him to manipulate all party members. *: A male octopus-human hybrid that controls various minions in the ocean. Defeating the narwhal known as Master of Ocean will unleash Subier's more powerful form. *: A swordsman who always keeps his word. Very powerful, with a strict code of honor. If the player defeats Rocbouquet before a fight, he becomes completely unwilling to compromise, and becomes unrelenting in combat. *: The only female of the Seven, she controls all the men in the Jungle villages. While there, she aspires to know the secret of a nearby temple. Her Temptation skill charms all male party members. She is also the sister of Lord Noel. The Seven Heroes will become more powerful as the player level up. However, even if the player moves quickly through the game, the last hero fought will always be in his/her most powerful stage (except for Subier if the player let Master of Ocean flee); this is only if the player enters the final dungeon with one of the Heroes remaining. If the player did not kill Kzinssie Reborn at the start of the final scenario, he will always have to fought in the final dungeon instead of any of the remaining Heroes. In the final battle, the Seven Heroes merge into an extremely powerful monster that uses all of their abilities. The names of most of the characters in the game are inspired by real-world and mythic names. The names of the Seven Heroes, in particular, are quasi anagrams of the seven major train stations on the Tokyo Yamanote Line. They are respectively: Shinjuku for Kzinssie, Shinagawa for Wagnas, Gotanda for Dantarg, (Shin-)Okubo for Bokhohn, Ebisu for Subier, Ueno for Noel, and Ikebukuro for Rocbouquet. Development =Original= The team of the game comprised around 20 people and development lasted one year. English translator Ted Woolsey noted at the time that while a release of the game overseas would have been nice, focus was needed for upcoming games such as Final Fantasy VII and Secret of Mana 2, so the game remained a Japanese exclusive. =Remasters= The game was ported to a Japanese cellphone named i-mode in 2010, and featured improved graphics, audio, new character classes including a ninja class that is popular in Japan, and a new dungeon exploring a subplot revolving around the games untold story of the \\"Seven Heroes\\". Because Romancing SaGa 2 was very popular in Japan, and a remaster of the original SaGa game was already released as Romancing SaGa Minstrel Song, the title was seen by Square Enix as the natural next SaGa title to re-release with a full remake. After the release was done in Japan, many western fans asked Square Enix over Twitter to release it the game, which had never been released outside of Japan, and this led to a port of the game being agreed to. All the original Super Nintendo code is still present in the remake. New features included new character classes, new dungeons, and a ‚ÄúNew Game Plus‚Äù mode. Other new gameplay features included auto save, Xbox Play Anywhere support, cross save between PlayStation Vita and the PlayStation 4, as well as an option to turn off the remastering content and play it just like it was originally made. Because of the high cost of changing the graphics to 3D and fan love of the original art style, a more dramatic redesign was decided against. However, as higher resolution screens are more common now than the original release, game backgrounds were redrawn to fit 2k screens. Producer Masanori Ichikawa noted that releasing the game across so many platforms was a new challenge to Square Enix, as Xbox and Steam are not as popular in Japan but are popular worldwide. =Release= A full remaster for iOS, Android and the PlayStation Vita was released on March 24, 2016 in Japan. It features remastered graphics, optimized controls and the added content and features from the mobile phone release in 2011. The iOS and Android versions were released in English on May 26, 2016, while the English PlayStation Vita version was still being worked on. In December 2016, series creator Akitoshi Kawazu said that there were issues with the English PlayStation Vita version, requiring a few more months before it would be ready for release; it was later announced for a December 15, 2017 release, alongside releases for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and Microsoft Windows. Reception Romancing SaGa 2 has sold nearly 1.5 million copies worldwide as of March 2003. Famitsu gave it a score of 26 out of 40. Game Revolution reviewed this title for the Nintendo Switch, saying that the game at first appears like a very average game from the time it originally came out, but praised the system of choices that changes and guides the gameplay, as well as the unique aspect of ruling an empire and eventually being about to issue commands to followers. Nintendo World Report said the game lacked interesting stories or characters, but called the gameplay system rewarding with many weapons to choose from and skill points to use. Reviewing the PlayStation 4 version, Push Square disdained the menu system taken from the previous mobile remake, and noted balance issues that made the traditional process of leveling up characters potentially hurt the player as the bosses grow stronger as you do. Reviewing the iOS version of the game, Touch Arcade loved how radically different it was from what kinds of games Square Enix had released in the Apple App Store until then. Despite enjoying the game, they noted the games unexplained gameplay systems and called the games balance system ‚Äúatrocious‚Äù. They also mentioned the poor translation into English and the lack of Mifi game controller support. Several of the game music tracks were featured in Theatrhythm Final Fantasy: Curtain Call as downloadable content. Legacy Romancing Saga 2 expanded the non-linear gameplay of its predecessor. While in the original Romancing Saga, scenarios were changed according to dialogue choices during conversations, Romancing Saga 2 further expanded on this by having unique storylines for each character that can change depending on the player's actions, including who is chosen, what is said in conversation, what events have occurred, and who is present in the party. PCGamesN credits Romancing SaGa 2 for having laid the foundations for modern Japanese role-playing video games. The game's progressive, non-linear, open world design and subversive themes influenced modern Japanese role-playing video games such as Final Fantasy XII (which Akitoshi Kawazu worked on), Final Fantasy XV, Nier: Automata and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.

Of fourteen living species in the genus, all but one are native to the tropics of the Americas, with one additional species (Hymenaea verrucosa) on the east coast of Africa. Some authors place the African species in a separate monotypic genus, Trachylobium.Gwilym Lewis, Brian Schrire, Barbara MacKinder, and Mike Lock. 2005. Legumes of the World. Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew: Richmond, England. In the Neotropics, Hymenaea is distributed through the Caribbean islands, and from southern Mexico to Brazil. Linnaeus named the genus in 1753 in Species Plantarum for Hymenaios, the Greek god of marriage ceremonies. The name is a reference to the paired leaflets. Most species of Hymenaea are large trees and they are primarily evergreen. They may grow to a height of and emerge above the forest canopy. Some species will grow both as tall forest trees and as smaller shrubby trees depending on their surrounding habitat. The leaves are pinnately bifoliolate, meaning that they have two leaflets attached to the sides of the petiole. The flowers grow in a panicle or corymb type of inflorescence.  Uses and properties  The pulpy center of the fruits are edible and contain starch. The fruit is sold in local markets in the Americas. The leaves may be used to make a tea. The trees produce a dense wood used for timber in making ships and furniture. The thick bark of some species is used by indigenous peoples of the Amazon to make canoes. Seeds contain large amounts (40% of dry weight) of a highly viscous polysaccharide (xyloglucan) which can be used in several industrial sectors such as food, paper, cosmetic and pharmaceutical. The trees also make hard resins that are used to manufacture varnish, especially the resin from Hymenaea courbaril (jatob√°) in Brazil. The resin that is produced in Brazil is known as South American copal, and Hymenaea verrucosa is the source of the valuable Zanzibar copal. Resin may be collected from living trees, or from the soil near the place where a tree once stood. Throughout its American range, indigenous peoples use the resin for incense and as a cement. Resin from the extinct species Hymenaea protera is the source of Dominican amber, while the extinct Hymenaea mexicana produced the resin which is the source of Mexican amber. Hymenaea courbaril has been used as a model organism to study the effect of increased concentration on the rate of photosynthesis in neotropical regions. When the concentration of was increased from an ambient reference level of 360ppm to 720ppm, the photosynthetic assimilation in the seedlings doubled. This suggests the species could play an important role in greenhouse gas sequestration, as atmospheric is expected to reach ca. 700 ppm by the year 2075 if current levels of fossil fuel consumption are maintained. Hymenaea courbaril is a very important species in programmes of recuperation of degraded rain forests in the Neotropics. It appears late in the natural regeneration process being classified as a 'late successional' or climax species.

Alabbar's jet followed a Pyongyang-approved route: It first flew along the edge of a triangular zone skirting the west coast of the Korean Peninsula, then headed westward, out to sea, before turning northward and eastward to Pyongyang. The speculation is that the purpose of Alabbar's trip was to explore investment opportunities in the isolated communist country as part of a broadening interest in emerging markets by Emaar. While there, Alabbar was understood to have visited a new World Peace Center, and the Botongkang Hotel, both affiliates of Tongil Group, the business investment arm of South Korea's Unification Church.

Penrose and R. M. Floyd, \\"Extraction of Rotational Energy from a Black Hole\\", Nature Physical Science 229, 177 (1971).Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler, Gravitation, Freeman and Company, 1973. That extraction can occur if the rotational energy of the black hole is located not inside the event horizon but outside in a region of the Kerr spacetime called the ergosphere in which any particle is necessarily propelled in locomotive concurrence with the rotating spacetime. All objects in the ergosphere become dragged by a rotating spacetime. In the process, a lump of matter entering the ergosphere is triggered to split into two parts. For example, the matter might be made of two parts that separate by firing an explosive or rocket which pushes its halves apart. The momentum of the two pieces of matter when they separate can be arranged so that one piece escapes from the black hole (it \\"escapes to infinity\\"), whilst the other falls past the event horizon into the black hole. With careful arrangement, the escaping piece of matter can be made to have greater mass-energy than the original piece of matter, and the infalling piece gets negative mass-energy. Although momentum is conserved the effect is that more energy can be extracted than was originally provided, the difference being provided by the black hole itself. In summary, the process results in a slight decrease in the angular momentum of the black hole, which corresponds to a transference of energy to the matter. The momentum lost is converted to energy extracted. The maximum amount of energy gain possible for a single particle via this process is 20.7% in the case of an uncharged black hole.Chandrasekhar, pg. 369 The process obeys the laws of black hole mechanics. A consequence of these laws is that if the process is performed repeatedly, the black hole can eventually lose all of its angular momentum, becoming non-rotating, i.e. a Schwarzschild black hole. In this case the theoretical maximum energy that can be extracted from an uncharged black hole is 29% of its original mass.Carroll, pg. 271 Larger efficiencies are possible for charged rotating black holes.http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.512.1400&rep;=rep1&type;=pdf Energetics of the Kerr‚ÄìNewman Black Hole by the Penrose Process; Manjiri Bhat, Sanjeev Dhurandhar & Naresh Dadhich; J. Astrophys. Astr. (1985) 6, 85‚Äì100 ‚Äì www.ias.ac.in In 1971, the theoretical physicist Yakov Zeldovich translated this idea of rotational superradiance from a rotating black hole to that of a rotating absorber such as a metallic cylinder,Physicists Verify Half-Century- Old Theory about Rotating Black Holes www.sci-news.com, 24 June 2020 and that mechanism was experimentally verified in 2020 in the case of acoustic waves.Amplification of waves from a rotating body www.nature.com, Published: 22 June 2020, retrieved 28 June 2020 Details of the ergosphere The outer surface of the ergosphere is described as the ergosurface and it is the surface at which light-rays that are counter-rotating (with respect to the black hole rotation) remain at a fixed angular coordinate, according to an external observer. Since massive particles necessarily travel slower than the speed of light, massive particles will necessarily rotate with respect to a stationary observer \\"at infinity\\". A way to picture this is by turning a fork on a flat linen sheet; as the fork rotates, the linen becomes twirled with it, i.e. the innermost rotation propagates outwards resulting in the distortion of a wider area. The inner boundary of the ergosphere is the event horizon, that event horizon being the spatial perimeter beyond which light cannot escape. Inside this ergosphere, the time and one of the angular coordinates swap meaning (time becomes angle and angle becomes time) because timelike coordinates have only a single direction (the particle rotates with the black hole in a single direction only). Because of this unusual coordinate swap, the energy of the particle can assume both positive and negative values as measured by an observer at infinity. If particle A enters the ergosphere of a Kerr black hole, then splits into particles B and C, then the consequence (given the assumptions that conservation of energy still holds and one of the particles is allowed to have negative energy) will be that particle B can exit the ergosphere with more energy than particle A while particle C goes into the black hole, i.e. and say , then . In this way, rotational energy is extracted from the black hole, resulting in the black hole being spun down to a lower rotational speed. The maximum amount of energy is extracted if the split occurs just outside the event horizon and if particle C is counter-rotating to the greatest extent possible. In the opposite process, a black hole can be spun up (its rotational speed increased) by sending in particles that do not split up, but instead give their entire angular momentum to the black hole.

New York's Forest Preserve, comprises almost all the lands owned by the state of New York within the Adirondack and Catskill parks. It is managed by the state Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC). Of the 4.7 million acres() of land in the state maintained by DEC, nearly 3 million () are considered to be Forest Preserve. These properties are required to be kept \\"forever wild\\" by Article 14 of the state constitution, and thus enjoy the highest degree of protection of wild lands in any state. It is thus necessary to amend it in order to transfer any of these lands to another owner or lessee. Currently there are more than 2.6 million acres () of Forest Preserve in the Adirondacks and in the Catskills. While today the Forest Preserve is valued largely as a conservation measure, its establishment in the 19th century was motivated primarily by economic considerations. Gradually its inherent worth as a nature preserve came to be seen, as it became a draw for recreation and tourism. A later amendment to Article 14 also made the lands important parts of water supply networks in the state, particularly New York City's, by allowing 3% of the total lands to be flooded for the construction of reservoirs. Origins =Adirondacks= During the years after the Civil War, the state's business community began to fear that unchecked logging in the Adirondacks could, through erosion, silt up the Erie Canal and eliminate the state's major economic advantage. They were informed by George Perkins Marsh's seminal 1865 book, Man and Nature, which made the connection between deforestation and desertification. The Adirondack (top) and Catskill parks within New York. Five years afterward, surveyor Verplanck Colvin beheld the Adirondacks from the summit of Seward Mountain during his mission to map the region. The idea of preserving the lands in some sort of park occurred to him then and there, and after he returned he wrote to his superiors in Albany that action needed to be taken to prevent that kind of despoliation. They appointed him to a committee to study the problem. In 1882, the businessmen began lobbying the legislature in earnest, and were rewarded three years later with the passage of the Forest Preserve Act, which provided that no logging would be allowed on state-owned land. =Catskills= Later that year, Ulster County's representatives in the Assembly were trying to get the county out of a crushing property tax debt a court had ruled they owed the state. Their solution was to convey some of the land on which they owed the taxes, mostly around Slide Mountain to the state. The Catskills had actually been considered when the Forest Preserve legislation was first passed, but Harvard botanist Charles Sprague Sargent had visited them and reported back to the legislature that it was not worth the effort as its streams did not appreciably affect the state's navigable waterways. However, an amended version of the bill was passed, after many deals and compromises among members, that added lands in Ulster, Sullivan and Greene counties to those eligible for Forest Preserve status. One side effect of this deal is that the state pays all local and county property taxes on the Forest Preserve as if it were a commercial landowner. This has helped many local governments remain solvent as they have very little economic assets other than forest resources. Article 14 To manage the land, the state had created a Forest Commission, making New York second only to California in having a state-level forestry agency. Most of its members were either openly or covertly connected to timber interests, however, and routinely approved dodges around the legislation to make sure logging would continue. In 1893 the legislature retroactively approved many of these practices by giving the commission the right to sell timber from the lands and trade them as it saw fit. It seemed the Forest Preserve now existed only on paper. But the following year New York held a constitutional convention, and the language of the law was written into the new state constitution with added words to close every loophole the Forest Commission had found. This section, Article 7 of the 1894 constitution (which was later changed to article 14), is often referred to as the \\"forever wild\\" section even though those two words do not appear next to each other in the text. Since amending New York's constitution is a deliberately cumbersome process that requires the approval of both Assembly and Senate in successive sessions of the legislature, followed by public approval at the next general election, this put a severe damper on any efforts by the Forest Commission to placate the loggers while still claiming to be honoring the law. Nonetheless, they would try. The new provision barely survived an attempt to gut it two years later when they again prevailed upon the legislature to approve an amendment requiring the state to \\"manage the land in accordance with sound timber management principles.\\" Voters resoundingly rejected it, however, and the principle of a \\"forever wild\\" Forest Preserve has remained inviolate in New York State to this day. Since then, over 2,000 amendments to Article 14 have been introduced in the legislature. Of those, only 28 have made it to the ballot, and only 20 have passed. Many of those have been otherwise routine land transfers that enabled the construction or expansion of public cemeteries or airports. Others have allowed for the construction and continued maintenance of reservoirs and highways. The most significant change was a pair of amendments that created the ski centers at Belleayre in the Catskills and Gore and Whiteface in the Adirondacks. The latter includes a toll road to the summit as well. Subsections were later added to allow the construction of reservoirs and make certain that use of the land remained free to the public beyond any reasonable fee the state could charge for a particular activity. Acquisition of new Forest Preserve land =Blue Line= In 1902, when Article 14 was more a matter of settled law, the legislature realized it had to delimit where Forest Preserve would be acquired. Accordingly, that year the Adirondack Park was defined in terms of the counties and towns within it. Two years later, the Catskill Park was defined. Instead of just declaring certain towns to be within the park, however, the legislature also used old survey tract boundaries, streams and railroad rights-of-way to clarify where it would be seeking land in the future. The park boundaries became known as the Blue Line since they were drawn, as they have been ever since, in blue ink on state maps. =Methods of land acquisition= While many of the original holdings came from tax foreclosures, over time the state bought huge tracts, aided by bond issues approved by the public. One in the late 1920s proved to be of particular value as the state was able to acquire a great deal of property at minimal prices due to the Great Depression. At that time the state's Parks Council bought the land and left management to the then-Conservation Commission. The state could also theoretically use its power of eminent domain to acquire Forest Preserve, but in practice it has rarely resorted to this. For the time being, the state is not seeking to expand the Forest Preserve as actively as it has in past years, since many of the most desired properties have been acquired. However, it remains publicly committed to working with any willing seller. Land classifications within the Forest Preserve Ecological and environmental awareness grew in the later years of the 20th century. Recreational use of the Forest Preserve began to rise to new levels, and newer methods of outdoor recreation became popular. These two factors led to a widespread realization that it was no long enough to simply rely on the language of Article 14 and the state's Conservation Law (as it was called at the time) and the court decisions and administrative opinions that relied on them. The Conservation Department became DEC in 1970. One of its new tasks was to implement more contemporary land management practices. But administration of the state land in both parks was (and still is) split between different regional offices, and it was hard to get them both following the same principles since they did not communicate much. There was also no serious planning involved. New trails were created, or allowed to be created by outside parties, with little thought to their environmental impact or regional role. Camping was permitted anywhere, and some of the sensitive alpine environments in the Adirondack High Peaks were showing the effects. Two temporary state commissions set up to consider the future course of the Adirondacks and Catskills in the early 1970s both strongly recommended that master plans be created for state lands in both parks. They also called for classifying the large tracts of state land as either wilderness areas or wild forest, depending on the degree of previous human impact and the level of recreational use they could sustain. Both of these were ultimately adopted, along with intensive use area and administrative use area designations for smaller parcels. In the Adirondacks, several additional classifications exist due to the more diverse character of lands in the extensive area of the park: primitive area; canoe area; travel corridor; wild, scenic, and recreational rivers; and historic area. =Wilderness area= New York State's wilderness areas are managed in a way essentially similar to their federal counterparts. Wilderness areas are those judged to have been far more affected by nature than humanity, to the extent that the latter is practically unnoticeable. As a result, the Forest Preserve's wildernesses boast extensive stands of virgin forest. No powered vehicles are allowed in wilderness areas. Recreation is limited to passive activities such as hiking, camping, hunting, birding and angling which are themselves subject to some further restrictions to ensure that they leave no trace for later recreationists. Special restrictions were recently imposed to limit impact on the largest and most popular wilderness area, the High Peaks Wilderness Complex in the Adirondacks. Powered equipment, such as chainsaws, may be necessary to keep trails open but such use is permitted only with the express written authorization of the DEC commissioner. Structures other than those that facilitate recreational use, such as bridges and lean-tos, are generally not allowed, either. The only significant difference between New York's wilderness policy and the federal government's is that the former limits the classification to contiguous parcels of at least 10,000 acres (40 km¬≤), instead of 5,000 (20 km¬≤). Currently, approximately 1.1 million acres (4,400 km¬≤) of the Forest Preserve is designated as wilderness. =Wild forest= While retaining an essentially wild character, Wild Forests are those areas which have seen higher human impact and can thus withstand a higher level of recreational use. Often these are lands which were logged heavily in the recent past (sometimes right before being transferred to the state). They might best be described as wildernesses where, within limits, powered vehicles are allowed. The wide roads left behind by logging operations make excellent trails not only for foot travel but for horses, snowmobiles, and cross-country skiing as well. Hunters prefer to seek game in wild forests because they can use cars or trucks to transport their kills out. Not all vehicle use is permitted, however. Mountain bikers and all-terrain vehicle enthusiasts have been lobbying DEC to allow them use of some Wild Forest trails in recent years. it appears that the former may be allowed to use some trails, particularly the old roads that lead to fire towers in both parks, DEC and most other users feel that even Wild Forest trails could not absorb the impact of ATVs. Powered equipment may be used to maintain trails and roads within Wild Forests. In the Catskills, it has long been informal DEC policy to treat all Wild Forest lands above in elevation as de facto wilderness. A proposed update to the master plan for the park would not only make this formal but extend the limit to . =Intensive use area= Intensive Use areas are places like state campgrounds or \\"day use\\" areas (more like a small public park) without camping. There may be designated campsites, picnic tables, charcoal grills, public restrooms and shower facilities and swimming areas with lifeguards. A fee is charged between May 1 and October 1 for most of these activities, and sometimes just for entering the area. DEC manages 45 campgrounds in the Adirondacks and 7 in the Catskills, for a total of 52 (public campgrounds elsewhere in New York are under the authority of the state parks). The state's three ski areas ‚Äî Belleayre Mountain in the Catskills and Gore mountain and Whiteface Mountain in the Adirondacks ‚Äî also fall under this classification as well. There are five day-use areas in the Adirondacks and one (so far) in the Catskills. =Administrative use area= This classification applies to a limited number of DEC-owned lands that are managed for other than Forest Preserve purposes. It covers a number of facilities devoted to research, some prisons, and state fish hatcheries in both parks. Most Administrative Use areas are located close to public roads and are generally in fairly developed areas of their respective parks.  Land classifications in the Adirondacks  The categories below are specific to Adirondack Forest Preserve lands; they are not used in the Catskills. = Primitive area = A Primitive Area is one that has much the same characteristics as wilderness area, but has some significant obstacles to receiving that status. It may have structures that cannot easily be removed within a given timeframe, or some other existing use that would complicate a wilderness designation. The designation is also applied to areas of less than the minimum area that have environments sensitive enough to require wilderness-level protection. For most practical purposes, then, there is no difference between a primitive area and a wilderness area. = Canoe area = Canoe Areas are lands with a wilderness character that have enough streams, lakes and ponds to provide ample opportunities for water-based recreation. Since they are relatively flat, and the severity of a typical Adirondack winter ensures that most bodies of water will freeze over, they are excellent places to snowshoe and cross-country ski in that season as well. Currently, the Saint Regis Canoe Area is the only such designated area in the park. = Wild, scenic, and recreational rivers = There are three levels of classification for Forest Preserve lands around streams, depending on their levels of impoundment and public access. *Wild rivers, or sections of rivers, are relatively inaccessible except by foot or horse, have no impoundments and are generally undeveloped except for foot bridges. *Scenic rivers, or sections of rivers, may have limited road access, some low-impact human use and can be impounded by log jams. *Recreational rivers, or sections of rivers, are readily accessible by road or rail and may be or have been at some point in the past developed or impounded by artificial means. = Historic area = These are the sites of buildings owned by the state that are significant to the history, architecture, archaeology or culture of the Adirondacks, those on the National Register of Historic Places or carrying or recommended for a similar state-level designation. = Travel corridor = This classification refers primarily to lands not really considered for recreational use but for those sections of the Forest Preserve constituting the right-of-way and roadbed for sections of the Adirondack Northway, other public highways in the Park, the Remsen-to-Lake Placid Adirondack Scenic Railroad right-of-way and lands immediately adjacent to and visible from them. It results from a mid-1960s amendment to Article 14 that allowed such road construction and maintenance, primarily to complete the Northway. Forest Preserve lands outside the parks State law also allows DEC to classify land it acquires outside the Blue Lines, but in counties partially within the parks, as Forest Preserve. These have usually been small detached parcels rarely organized into larger, named units. Article 14's prohibition on further sale or transfer still applies, although the state may allow the timber on these lands to be harvested. Controversies While no one talks seriously of rescinding Article 14 anymore, that hasn't stopped some residents of the state from publicly chafing at its strictures. This is particularly common in the Adirondacks, since the many vast tracts of land under Forest Preserve protection limit economic opportunities in a region where it has always been a struggle to earn a living. Melvil Dewey sounded a common theme in the early 20th century when, advocating another constitutional amendment to open up more land to logging, he complained that the current situation only benefited \\"the bugs,\\" referring to the blackfly infestations that keep many residents indoors during daylight hours in the early summer. =Fire towers= In the late 1990s a DEC forester writing a management plan for the Balsam Lake Wild Forest in the Catskills recommended that the fire tower on top of the similarly named mountain be removed and dismantled as nonconforming. He did this in the hope that someone would step forward to save not only this but the other four fire towers on state land in the Catskill Park. At that time the towers had not been used for fire control for years, and some were no longer safe to climb. Someone did, and after a matching challenge to raise the money, DEC was not only able to exempt them from removal on the grounds that they contributed to the public's understanding of the Forest Preserve, but repaired all of them as well. In 1997 they were added to the National Register of Historic Places. All five and their accompanying cabins have been or will be converted into small interpretive centers, with displays identifying nearby peaks. Similar campaigns were undertaken in the Adirondacks, and hikers can now even receive a patch for their backpacks by visiting all the Forest Preserve firetowers. DEC even built a new trail to the tower on Red Hill in the Catskills, as the road to it crosses private land whose owner will not permit the public to cross it. The only fire tower still a subject of dispute is on Hurricane Mountain in the Adirondacks, since unlike the others it is within a Primitive Area classified by the DEC as the Hurricane Mountain Primitive Area. There has been speculation that the DEC would like to reclassify this parcel into a Wilderness Area. Wilderness Areas are considered \\"untouched by man\\" and a firetower is viewed as a non-conforming structure. As such, the DEC wants it removed for this reason. However, residents of the area have been fighting to keep it since not only is it a popular and relatively easy hike, it is the only fire tower in the High Peaks region. The Hurricane Mountain fire tower is also the insignia of the Adirondack Mountain Club Hurricane Mountain Chapter. =Canisters= Also in the late 1990s, DEC, in its long-delayed management plan for the High Peaks Wilderness Complex, called for the removal of the canisters at the summits of the 20 High Peaks that lacked official trails but were nevertheless climbed frequently by the growing number of hikers seeking membership in the Adirondack Forty-Sixers. Many members felt these were an integral part of the club's identity and wanted to keep them. But in summer 2000, the 46ers' board decided to remove them as they did not feel it would be worth pursuing a lawsuit to keep them, especially with little law on their side. Some members are still bitter about this decision since it was taken without consulting the group as a whole. At the same time in the Catskills, however, the situation played out differently. The 1998 draft update to the Unit Management Plan for the Slide Mountain Wilderness Area, the Catskills' counterpart to the HPWC, similarly called for the removal of four canisters from that area. Public comment, mostly from members of the Catskill Mountain 3500 Club, which maintains those canisters, persuaded DEC to compromise, accepting ownership of them and some design changes in exchange for keeping them as, like the fire towers, structures that enhanced understanding of the Forest Preserve. This change was later written into the 2003 draft update to the Catskill State Land Master Plan. The different outcome is largely because the Catskills' more open forests mean that its trailless peaks actually are trailless, whereas it has been hard to say that of the Adirondack trailless peaks for some time now.

Several Mennonite families are located nearby. Hawkesville is noted for its custom- built furniture industry.  History  Though Wellesley Township itself was not surveyed until 1842 and was only incorporated in 1852, settlers were already long in this area. By 1805, many Mennonites from Pennsylvania had settled nearby in what became known as Berlin, and today as Kitchener. In 1837, the same year that William Lyon Mackenzie's rebellion was defeated at York (now Toronto), John Philip Schweitzer from Germany squatted at what is now Hawkesville, and had of land cleared over the following nine years. Then, John Hawke received government permission to buy the clearing for $700.00 on the condition that he build a grist mill (for flour) and a sawmill within two years. John Hawke, the second son of Benjamin Hawke and Mary (Lount), had arrived. Benjamin Hawke was a United Empire Loyalist and a Quaker that fled military conflict in the United States to settle in Simcoe County. Though his wife's family, the Lounts, were also Quakers, his brother-in-law Samuel Lount was one of William Lyon Mackenzie's lieutenants in the 1837 revolt. After Samuel Lount was hanged for treason, Benjamin Hawke decided to move out of Simcoe County. When his son John received permission to purchase in Waterloo County, Benjamin moved there with his wife, his four sons, and his seven daughters. The Hawkes arrived in 1846; John built the grist mill, his younger brother Piercifer built a sawmill, and \\"Hawke‚Äôs village\\" appeared on the Waterloo County map. A post office was established in Hawkesville in 1852, operated by Gabriel Hawke. When the Waterloo County boundaries were established in 1852 to include the townships of Waterloo, Wellesley, Wilmot, Woolwich, and North Dumfries, John Hawke was named the first Reeve of Wellesley and the first township hall was built in Hawkesville. When the decision was being made for the location of a county seat, Hawkesville originally anticipated being chosen over Berlin and Galt. However, John Hawke had the deciding vote, and he cast it in favour of Berlin. With the railroad and the county seat, Berlin began to grow rapidly and kept on growing; Hawkesville flourished only until the end of the century before diminishing. Records from 1864 indicate that the community of about 400 people had three stores, two woolen factories, a tannery, two wagon makers and some tradesmen. The school in Hawkesville had 100 students by that time. There were four churches, although two were still under construction in 1864. The 6th Division court held its hearings in this community. Into the early 1900s, the village Carriage and wagon maker, George M. Diefenbacker (his preferred spelling) would entertain his grandson each summer, the late Prime Minister John G. Diefenbaker. Because Hawkesville is located on a hill near the Conestogo River, it was too difficult to construct a railway to Hawkesville. =Churches= A Presbyterian congregation worshiped in town from 1868 to 1946. Their church building was dedicated as Hawkesville Mennonite Church on January 1, 1950. Only the Hawkesville Mennonite Church and the Countryside Conservative Mennonite Fellowship remain in Hawkesville. A United Brethren church also existed in Hawkesville from 1865 until 1904. The gothic windows and rafters are still visible inside the shop of Hawkwoods Custom Furniture. Another group started meeting in 1931 and completed the building of a Gospel Hall next door to the village's cemetery in 1939. This group became the Hawkesville Bible Chapel, but their Hall became overcrowded and they moved into a new building in Wallenstein in 1968 where the Wallenstein Bible Chapel remains today.  Economy  Hawkesville is home to several small and medium size businesses including the larger Frey Building Contractors and the Country Lane Builders. Hawkesville is noted for its custom-built furniture industry. While many Mennonites in the surrounding area build and sell furniture, Hawkesville itself is home to three furniture businesses: Chervin Custom Woodworks, Hawkwoods Custom Furniture, and Homestead Woodworks. Noah Martin's summer sausage was located in Hawkesville until his death.  Government  Located in the Kitchener-Conestoga electoral riding, Hawkesville has been represented in Ottawa, since 2006, by the Conservative Member of Parliament, Harold Albrecht. At Queen's Park in Toronto, Hawkesville has been represented since 2018 by the Progressive Conservative Member of Provincial Parliament, Mike Harris Jr..

It is an intangible property right recognised and protected by the law, that has no existence apart from the recognition given by the law, and that confers no present possession of a tangible object.Re Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA (No 8) [1998] AC 214 Since incorporeal assets such as claims for repayment of debts, or assigned rights in contracts cannot be subject to possession, they cannot be categorised as choses in possession.Re Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA (No 8) [1998] AC 214, Brice v Bannister (1878) 3 QBD 569 at 573, (Lord Coleridge) In certain circumstances, the chose in action creates a separate proprietary right, independent from the property in which it may reference.Re BCCI (No 8), Re Adams [2004] EWHC 2379 This new property can be subject to charges or can be assigned. For example, a right to enforce and receive payment for a debt, obtain money by way of damages for breach of contract, or receive recompense for a wrong is a chose in action. Two consequences result from this, firstly, they are claims which cannot be executed by the chose-holder without the enforcement of legal proceedings. Second, these examples may be themselves assigned, novated, or otherwise used by the chose-holder.M A Clarke, R J A Hooley, R J C Munday, L S Sealy, A M Tettenborn, P G Turner Commercial Law: Text, Cases and Materials' \\"Chapter 22: Assignment of Choses in Action\\", 5th Edition (2017) OUP, 859 If the economic value of the asset is the right to sue. Historically, documents which represented a title to a chose in action of a particular kind, such as bonds or other documentary intangibles were themselves chose in possession because, similar to promissory notes they were negotiable and thus could be physically seised. That is to say, they were transferred solely by delivery of the document themselves. Today, most bonds and other financial instruments have been dematerialised and are issued as a single global note. The consequence of this is that most financial instruments are now choses in actionheld by the beneficial party against the broker holding assets in a securities depository such CREST, where investors own interlocking interests in trusts, rather than the actual issued note.Goode and Gullifer Legal Problems of Credit and Security, 6th Edition, 2017 The development of dematerialised securities brings some objects which are termed as chose in action today full circle, such as bonds or bill of lading which the court first developed as choses in action, and which, without the use of a negotiable instrument no longer operate as choses in possession. Currently, claims which are treated as being \\"locked up\\" inside the paper includes pledge, negotiables, and custodial bailment. Choses in Action are particularly crucial to the assignment of interests in law, and thus play a crucial role in the operation and coordination of the financial markets. Certain rights, such as a claim to rescission of a mortgage is a right of action, but not a chose in action or part of one that can be assigned.Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd v West Bromwich Building Society [1998] 1 ALL ER 98. Because the category is often broadly construed, there have been numerous attempts to expand the category to allow new intangible assets to fall within the chose in action. =Effect of Fusing of Chancery and Common Law= The chose can either be legal or equitable. Prior to the Judicature Acts, which fused the courts of Equity and the Common law into a single jurisdiction, where the chose could be recovered only by an action at law, as a debt (whether arising from contract or tort), it was termed a legal chose in action; where the chose was recoverable only by a suit in equity, as a legacy or money held upon a trust, it was termed an equitable chose in action. Before the Judicature Acts, a legal chose in action was not assignable, i.e., the assignee could not sue at law in his own name. To this rule there were two exceptions: # the crown had always been able to assign choses in action that are certain, such as an ascertained debt, but not those that are uncertain; and # assignments valid by operation of law, e.g., on marriage, death, or bankruptcy. On the other hand, however, by the law merchant, which is part of the law of England, and which disregards the rules of common law, bills of exchange were freely assignable. Prior to this point, the courts of equity could not enforce a legal chose in action and vice versa. The consequence was that, with these and certain statutory exceptions (e.g., actions on policies of insurance), an action on an assigned chose in action must have been brought at law in the name of the assignor, though the sum recovered belonged in equity to the assignee. All choses in action being in equity assignable, except those altogether incapable of being assigned, in equity the assignee might have sued in his own name, making the assignor a party as co-plaintiff or as defendant. The Judicature Acts made the distinction between legal and equitable choses in action of no importance. The Judicature Act of 1873, s. 25 (6), enacted that the legal right to a debt or other legal chose in action could be passed by absolute assignment in writing under the hand of the assignor. This was later updated by the Law of Property Act 1925 s136 which outlined that assignment must behttp://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/15-16/20/section/136 * In writing * Is absolute, and not by charge only * and written notice has been given to the obligor. These requirements are significant because without notice, it prevents the assignee from suing on the debt. Until the debtor has given notice, set-offs continue to arise between the assignor and the debtor, the debtor does not know to pay anyone other than the assignor; and the assignee may lose priority to subsequent assignees who do provide notice.Dearle v Hall (1828) 3 Russ 1 The difference between present and future choses in action has been likened to the difference between a tree and its fruit. Chose in possession A chose in possession refers to a bundle of rights and remedies, (which in England are inextricably linked),See Browne-Wilkinson VC in Spain v Christie, Manson, & Woods [1986] 3 All ER 28 at 35 of an object of tangible personal property that can be physically possessed by the owner and can be transferred by delivery. Relation, or rather, capacity of control and apparent dominion is required as the foundation of the alleged chose in possession. This is impossible with incorporeal rights. Possession and possession-based techniques are of little relevance to modern financial markets, but still play a substantial role in commercial and retail lending.D&D; Wines International (in liquidation) [2014] EWCA Civ 215 Therefore a chose in possession denotes not only the right to enjoy or possess a thing, but also the actual or constructive enjoyment of it. The possession may be absolute or qualified. It is absolute when the person is fully and completely the proprietor or owner of the thing; it is qualified when he \\"has not an exclusive right, or not a permanent right, but a right that may sometimes subsist and at other times not subsist\\", as in the case of animals ferae naturae (\\"of a feral nature\\", or wild). A chose in possession is freely transferable by delivery. Previous to the Married Women's Property Act of 1882, a wife's choses in possession became vested in her husband immediately upon her marriage, while her choses in action did not belong to her husband until he had converted them to possession. However, this difference is now practically obsolete. In practice, there is little difference between the utility of a chose in possession and a chose in action, outside of insolvency. However, a Chose in possession is particularly important in view of insolvency as the possessory right of the asset allows for enforcement of security irrespective of the solvency of the company. Where an asset is (1) unique and cannot be replicated, such as shares in a company amounting to board control; (2) a proprietary interest wherein account of profits of the original owed item; or (3) procedural remedies; exist, a chose in possession will be crucial in enforcement.

Valbonne means \\"the good valley\\" in Proven√ßal and translates to \\"Vaubona\\" in Occitan. The commune is part of the Communaut√© d'agglom√©ration de Sophia Antipolis. The technology park of Sophia Antipolis is partly located in Valbonne. Geography Valbonne is situated in a basin, halfway along the Brague river. The commune consists of two sites: * the old village situated in the extreme north-west * Sophia Antipolis in the east, around the towns of Haut-Sartoux and Garbeja√Øre History There are traces of prehistoric human settlement in the area that date back to the Iron Age, the first days of agriculture. Many prehistoric artifacts such as Neolithic stone axes, funeral urns from the Bronze Age, and fragments of amphora, oil and grain jars (dolia) have been excavated.Claude Rucker, L'aven s√©pulcral de la Mort-de-Lambert √† Valbonne (A.-M.), ARCHEAM, 9, 2001-2002. The remains of an aqueduct constructed during Roman settlement in the 3rd century A.D. are also present in the area of Clausonne. In the High Middle Ages several neighbouring hamlets (Opio, Le Brusc, Sartoux, les Clausonnes and Villebruc) already existed. But the small, isolated valley of Valbonne was deserted. In 1199, the land was offered by the bishop of Antibes to the abbey of Prads (Prads-Haute-Bleone, Alpes-de-Haut-Provence) who founded the abbey of St. Mary. At the time, this area was called Vallis Bona, meaning \\"the good valley\\". Later, it became known as Valbonne. Prads and Valbonne were two of the 15 abbeys and priories of the monastic order of Chalais, an order of \\"Dauphinois-Proven√ßal\\" monks. The order was created a century earlier and was similar to the Cistercians. The poverty of these mountain-dwellers caused their disintegration and, in 1297 the abbot of Valbonne came under the authority of the abbey of St. Andrew of Villeneuve-les-Avignon. The bishop of Grasse refused to ratify the arrangement, and in 1303 offered St. Mary to the abbey of L√©rins. In 1335 the Pope settled the question ‚Äì he allocated St. Mary to L√©rins. At the end of the Middle Ages war, drought and the Black Death of 1351 caused the flight of the inhabitants of the surrounding villages, and left the abbey and its environs deserted. In 1486, under Louis XI, Provence was legally incorporated into the French royal domain, and this began the renaissance of the region. The village now known as Valbonne was founded in 1519, by Augustin de Grimaldi, bishop of Grasse and abbot of L√©rins. Augustin de Grimaldi commissioned the worker-monk Don Taxil to construct the village adjacent to the abbey to increase the value of the land. The aim was to use exclusively local labour to build a community that would lead to the repopulation of the region. This was accomplished by the importation of Italian artisans, to work the clay found in the nearby villages of Vallauris and Biot. The village is laid out along a grid pattern, under the influence of Roman military camps, with two principal avenues, arranged perpendicular to one another, and the forum at the intersection. Arcades were added to the central square in the 17th century and it became known as la Place des Arcades. Originally, the grid consisted of ten streets crossing ten streets but the village has progressively expanded around the center. The architectural plan of the village of Valbonne differs from that of many other villages located in the South of France which typically spiral around a hill. The construction took over a century, and the village remained relatively unchanged until the middle of the 20th century. In the last century, a surrounding municipality of Valbonne has been constructed around the ancient village. Although the population of the town of Valbonne has greatly increased in recent years, the village itself has remained intact, retaining much of its 16th century charm. Surrounding Valbonne, the proximity of the coast and especially the construction in the 1970s of the technology park Sophia Antipolis has transformed the region. Economy Inria in Valbonne While the village has been preserved in its original condition, nearby is the high tech centre of Sophia Antipolis, constructed in the 1970s along the same lines as La D√©fense near Paris. The name was adopted from the ancient Greek colony of Antipolis which resided in the nearby village of Antibes. This plateau was one of the few remaining vast sections of land that had remained untouched in the French Riviera. Initially, investors interested in Sophia Antipolis were mainly oil and mining companies. The park, however, took a different turn when the University of Nice decided to move parts of its campus to the plateau in the 1980s. As a result, Sophia Antipolis became an important site of research and development. Today, Sophia Antipolis has evolved into a highly recognized international community, with more than 1,000 companies hiring more than 25,000. It now has an area of 2,500 ha spreading over the municipality of Valbonne and its surrounding municipalities, Antibes, Biot, Mougins, and Vallauris. The community continues to grow day by day, with the recent establishments of the municipalities of la Colle-sur-Loup, Roquefort-les-Pins and Villeneuve-Loubet. Population The people who live there are known as Valbonnais or Sophipolitains. Sights =The old village= The architecture of the houses of Valbonne is as rigorous as the street layout (see History above). Originally, they were all identical. The ground floor was for deliveries (these are now found half-underground due to a rise in the level of the street). On the first floor was the living room, above, the bedrooms. Finally, the attic, where stores were hoisted up with the aid of a pulley (some examples of these can still be found). In the main street is the former town hall, complete with tower and fountain. It was constructed in the 19th century. =The abbey-church= Church of Valbonne The Romanesque abbey- church was built in the 13th century by Benedictine monks of the Order of Chalais. It became the parish church when the village was built. It is a perfect example of Chalaisien architecture, which is very similar to primitive Cistercian architecture. The clock tower was added in the 19th century. The religious architecture is supplemented by several chapels and oratories, both in the village and surrounding countryside. The monastic buildings have been well preserved. Their restoration, begun in 1970, is ongoing. They house the Heritage Museum \\"Le Vieux Valbonne\\", which houses numerous everyday objects representing the rural life of the village. Exhibitions and presentations bring to life the history of the village and monastic order of Chalais.

Houghton Mifflin Company, 1994. The Jet 14 is a development of Uffa Fox's International 14. Production Siddons used a set of early International 14 molds that he had acquired to create the Jet 14 hull shape, with a partial foredeck added. It was initially intended to be sailed as a catboat with just a mainsail or as a sloop, with a jib, but these days is only sailed as a sloop. The design was initially built by Siddons & Sindle in Island Heights, New Jersey, United States, but the company went out of business and production was assumed by the Allen Boat Company of Buffalo, New York, who still produce it. A total of 1,000 boats have been built. Design The Jet 14 is a recreational sailboat, with the early boats built predominantly of wood and later boats constructed of fiberglass, with wood trim. It has a fractional sloop rig with wooden or aluminum spars. The hull has a plumb stem, a vertical transom, a transom-hung rudder controlled by a tiller and a retractable centerboard. It displaces . The boat has a draft of with the centerboard extended and with it retracted, allowing beaching or ground transportation on a trailer or car roof rack. For sailing the design is equipped with either a mainsheet traveler or a headknocker cleat mounted on the boom. The class rules were amended to allow spinnakers in 1971 and many boats have cutouts in the foredeck for spinnaker stowage, either a single cutout near the bow of one on each side of the mast. The boat's class rules restrict the cutout sizes. The design is often sailed with the spinnaker and jib hoisted unless in very light winds. The class rules permit a lever-style boom vang and a jib window for visibility. The rules require buoyancy to be added to the wooden boats, while the fiberglass ones have built-in buoyancy tanks that make them unsinkable. The design has a Portsmouth Yardstick racing average handicap of 97.6 and is normally raced with a crew of two sailors. Operational history There are fleets sailed in New York state, New Jersey, Maryland and Ohio. In a 1994 review Richard Sherwood wrote, \\"The Jet 14 ... is fast, going well to windward.

Early life James Madison Pendleton was born November 20, 1811, in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, the son of John Pendleton and Frances Jackson Thompson. He was named for President James Madison. When he was small his parents moved to Christian County, Kentucky. At age seventeen, he united with the Bethel church in Christian County and was baptized. Ministry J. M. Pendleton was ordained at Hopkinsville, Kentucky in 1833. In his lifetime he pastored churches at Bethel, Hopkinsville, and Bowling Green in Kentucky; Murfreesboro in Tennessee; Hamilton in Ohio; and Upland in Pennsylvania. While pastoring in Bowling Green, Kentucky, Pendleton married Catherine Stockton Garnett in 1838. They had five children. In 1857 he became professor of Theology at Union University in Murfreesboro. Though a born Southerner, Pendleton disagreed with secession and moved north around 1862. Denison University conferred on him the title of Doctor of Divinity in 1865. Pendelton was involved with Baptist industrialist John P. Crozer and others in founding the Crozer Theological Seminary in Upland, Pennsylvania. Pendleton, Amos Cooper Dayton, and James Robinson Graves, due to the work and influence, were known as \\"The Great Triumvirate\\" of the Landmark movement. His \\"An Old Landmark Reset\\" is considered a foundational document of this movement within the Southern Baptist Convention. According to David Dockery and Timothy George in Baptist Theologians, \\"Pendleton's desire to restrict Landmark ideology to the central issue of the authority and function of the local church, his atypical Southern opinions regarding slavery, and his desire to preserve the union of the United States\\" led toward a breach and dissolution of the \\"Triumvirate\\" following the Civil War. In 1849, Pendleton wrote a series of letters, ‚ÄúLetters to Rev. W. C. Buck in Review of His Articles on Slavery‚Äù, in response to editorials by his friend and colleague William Calmes Buck, editor of the ‚ÄúBaptist Banner‚Äù. Pendleton disagreed with Buck and wanted his own letters published in the Baptist Banner; however, Buck would not publish them. Pendleton then had his letters published in an emancipationist newsletter, the Louisville Examiner. [2] Pendleton, Dayton, and Graves articulated and promoted landmark beliefs through their books and newspaper articles in the Tennessee Baptist. Pendleton also wrote for Southern Baptist Review. Pendleton and Graves published a hymn book called The Southern Psalmist in 1858. Pendleton died March 4, 1891 and is buried in the Fairview Cemetery in Bowling Green, Kentucky.

If an adequate model of the objective function is found within the trust region, then the region is expanded; conversely, if the approximation is poor, then the region is contracted. The fit is evaluated by comparing the ratio of expected improvement from the model approximation with the actual improvement observed in the objective function. Simple thresholding of the ratio is used as the criterion for expansion and contraction‚Äîa model function is \\"trusted\\" only in the region where it provides a reasonable approximation. Trust-region methods are in some sense dual to line-search methods: trust- region methods first choose a step size (the size of the trust region) and then a step direction, while line-search methods first choose a step direction and then a step size. The general idea behind trust region methods is known by many names; the earliest use of the term seems to be by Sorensen (1982). A popular textbook by Fletcher (1980) calls these algorithms restricted-step methods. Additionally, in an early foundational work on the method, Goldfeld, Quandt, and Trotter (1966) refer to it as quadratic hill-climbing. Example Conceptually, in the Levenberg‚ÄìMarquardt algorithm, the objective function is iteratively approximated by a quadratic surface, then using a linear solver, the estimate is updated. This alone may not converge nicely if the initial guess is too far from the optimum. For this reason, the algorithm instead restricts each step, preventing it from stepping \\"too far\\". It operationalizes \\"too far\\" as follows. Rather than solving A \\\\, \\\\Delta x = b for \\\\Delta x, it solves \\\\big(A + \\\\lambda \\\\operatorname{diag}(A)\\\\big) \\\\, \\\\Delta x = b, where \\\\operatorname{diag}(A) is the diagonal matrix with the same diagonal as A, and Œª is a parameter that controls the trust-region size. Geometrically, this adds a paraboloid centered at \\\\Delta x = 0 to the quadratic form, resulting in a smaller step. The trick is to change the trust-region size (Œª). At each iteration, the damped quadratic fit predicts a certain reduction in the cost function, \\\\Delta f_\\\\text{pred}, which we would expect to be a smaller reduction than the true reduction. Given \\\\Delta x, we can evaluate : \\\\Delta f_\\\\text{actual} = f(x) - f(x + \\\\Delta x). By looking at the ratio \\\\Delta f_\\\\text{pred}/\\\\Delta f_\\\\text{actual}, we can adjust the trust-region size. In general, we expect \\\\Delta f_\\\\text{pred} to be a bit smaller than \\\\Delta f_\\\\text{actual}, and so the ratio would be between, say, 0.25 and 0.5. If the ratio is more than 0.5, then we are damping the step much, so expand the trust region (decrease Œª) and iterate. If the ratio is smaller than 0.25, then the true function is diverging \\"too much\\" from the trust-region approximation, so shrink the trust region (increase Œª) and try again. References Andrew R.

It refers to the idea that if an unfounded premise or urban legend is mentioned and repeated by many individuals, the premise will be erroneously accepted as the truth. This concept is related to communal reinforcement or the fallacy of argumentum ad populum and argumentum ad nauseam. Origin The proverb came from the story of an alleged speech by Pang Cong (), an official of the state of Wei in the Warring States period (475 BC ‚Äì 221 BC) in Chinese History. According to the Warring States Records, or Zhan Guo Ce, before he left on a trip to the state of Zhao, Pang Cong asked the King of Wei whether he would hypothetically believe in one civilian's report that a tiger was roaming the markets in the capital city, to which the King replied no. Pang Cong asked what the King thought if two people reported the same thing, and the King said he would begin to wonder. Pang Cong then asked, \\"what if three people all claimed to have seen a tiger?\\" The King replied that he would believe in it. Pang Cong reminded the King that the notion of a live tiger in a crowded market was absurd, yet when repeated by numerous people, it seemed real. Since Pang Cong, as a high-ranking official, had more than three opponents and critics, he was in fact urging the King to pay no attention to those who would spread rumors about him (Pang Cong) while he was away. \\"I understand,\\" the King replied, and Pang Cong left for Zhao. Yet, slanderous talk took place. When Pang Cong returned to Wei, the King indeed stopped seeing him. Cognitive biases The tendency to accept absurd information is rooted in certain cognitive biases. The first of which is the motivated reasoning concept, which is an emotion-biased decision-making phenomenon. It is the idea that humans are motivated to believe whatever confirms their opinions. Motivated reasoning can lead to a false social consensus over time. The second concept is social consensus reality, which explains that beliefs with high societal consensus are treated like facts, whereas beliefs with relatively low consensus are more susceptible to persuasion and attitude change. The latter is most likely a product of the social consensus of the specific community one lives in. Examples from economics One application of the cognitive biases highlighted through the anecdote is that markets are efficient. Often investors jump on a wagon that is either directed in buying or shorting a certain stock or index with the main motivation that many other investors are behaving in a unilateral way. In the short-term when many investors buy a certain stock the market experiences a self-fulfilling prophecy and the stock actually gains value although the company might be underperforming and just benefiting from current market trends. Investors who take such decisions are not basing their justification on fundamental analysis or certain limited information but mainly follow an investment trend that is demonstrated by a high number of other investors.

Iraqi offensive On 31 August 1996, the Iraqi military launched its biggest offensive since 1991 against the city of Irbil in Iraqi Kurdistan to defuse the Kurdish Civil War between the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and Kurdistan Democratic Party. This attack stoked American fears that the Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein intended to launch a genocidal campaign against the Kurds similar to the campaigns of 1988 and 1991. It also placed Saddam in clear violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 688 forbidding repression of Iraqs ethnic minorities. Cruise missile strikes The strikes were initially planned to be by aircraft launched from the aircraft carrier , including aircraft from Fighter Squadron 11 (VF-11) and Fighter Squadron 31 (VF-31), both operating F-14D Tomcats; Electronic Attack Squadron 139 (VAQ-139), operating EA-6B Prowlers; Attack Squadron 196 (VA-196), operating A-6E Intruders equipped with the Target Recognition and Attack Multi-Sensor (TRAM) system; Anti-Submarine Squadron 35 (VS-35) flying S-3B Vikings; and Strike Fighter Squadron 113 (VFA-113) and Strike Fighter Squadron 25 (VFA-25), both operating F/A-18 Hornets. However the strike was instead launched by U.S. Navy surface warships and U.S. Air Force bombers, using cruise missiles. The fires a Tomahawk missile at Iraq in September 1996. On 3 September 1996, a joint operation by the U.S. Navy's Carl Vinson Carrier Battle Group and U.S. Air Force, a combined strike team consisting of the guided-missile cruiser , the guided-missile destroyer , and B-52 Stratofortress bombers escorted by F-14D Tomcat fighters from Carl Vinson, with the nuclear-powered guided-missile cruiser serving as Air Warfare Commander,https://www.history.navy.mil/content/history/nhhc/research/histories/ship- histories/danfs/c/carl-vinson--cvn-70-.html launched 27 cruise missiles against Iraqi air defense targets in southern Iraq. A second wave of 17 missiles was launched later that day from the destroyers , , USS Laboon, and the nuclear-powered attack submarine . The missiles hit targets in and around Kut, Iskandariyah, Nasiriyah, and Tallil. Aftermath The attacks were primarily aimed at retaliation for the targeting of USAF fighters in the Northern and Southern no-fly zones, and were targeted at surface-to-air missile sites and command, control, and communication locations, with the intention of degrading the Iraqi air defense infrastructure. These strikes, along with follow-on deployments of troops, aircraft, and the addition of a second aircraft carrier to the region, achieved their desired results. It is debatable whether the attacks did or did not have a substantial effect on Iraqs northern campaign. Once they installed the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) in control of Irbil, Iraqi troops withdrew from the Kurdish region back to their initial positions. The KDP drove the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) from its other strongholds, and with additional Iraqi help, captured Sulaymaniyah. The PUK and its leader, Jalal Talabani, retreated to the border, and American forces evacuated 700 Iraqi National Congress personnel and 6,000 pro-Western Kurds out of northern Iraq. In response to Iraqs moves, the United States and United Kingdom also expanded Operation Southern Watch and the southern Iraqi no-fly zones from the 32nd parallel to the 33rd parallel, bringing it to the edges of Baghdad itself.

Overview  It lies at the foot of the Apennine Mountains, near the sources of the Sarno River, called Sarnus in ancient times, a stream connected by canal with Pompei and the sea. Paper, cotton, silk, linen and hemp are manufactured. The travertine which forms round the springs of the Sarno was used even at ancient Pompeii as building material.  History  The area of Sarno has been inhabited since Neolithic times, and in pre-historical times housed Oscan and Samnites settlements. Later it was acquired by the Romans, who held it until the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD. The first nucleus of the future Sarno grew in the 8th century around a castle founded by the Lombards of Benevento. Before its incorporation to the domains of the crown of Naples, Sarno gave its name to a county held in succession by the Orsini, Coppola, Tuttavilla, and Colonna families. On May 5, 1998 Sarno and the neighbouring villages of Quindici, Siano and Bracigliano were devastated by a series of landslides. 180 houses were destroyed, 450 severely damaged, and 161 people died in what was one of the biggest catastrophes of its kind in modern Italy. The landslides had been caused by several days of torrential rainfalls, but were also blamed on agricultural, residential and industrial overexploitation and the lack of any substantial environmental programs. The catastrophe prompted the Italian Ministry of the Environment to introduce a couple of legislative measures for environmental protection which have come to be known as legge Sarno.  Ecclesiastical history  The Diocese of Sarno was established circa 1000 AD, presumably as suffragan of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Oristano. In 1534 it lost territory to the Diocese of Nola. The neighbouring bishopric of Cava de' Tirreni was held in personal union with Sarno (united aeque principaliter) from 27 June 1818 till 25 September 1972. Suppressed on 30 September 1986, its territory and title being merged into the thus renamed Diocese of Nocera Inferiore-Sarno. =Episcopal ordinaries= (all Roman Rite) Suffragan Bishops of Sarno (without ordinals; first incumbent(s) lacking?) * Riso (1066? ‚Äì ?) * Giovanni (1111‚Äì1118) * Giovanni (1119‚Äì1134) * Pietro (1134‚Äì1156) * Giovanni (1156‚Äì1180) * Unfrido (1180‚Äì1202) * Tibaldo (1201‚Äì1208) * Ruggiero (1209‚Äì1216) * Giovanni (1216‚Äì1224) * Giovanni (1224‚Äì1258) * Angelo d‚ÄôAquino (1258‚Äì1265) * Giovanni (1265‚Äì1296) * Guglielmo (1296‚Äì1309) * Ruggiero De Canalibus (1310‚Äì1316) * Ruggiero (1316‚Äì1316) * Ruggiero De Miramonte (1316‚Äì1324) * Antonio da Ancona (1324‚Äì1326) * Napoleone (1326‚Äì1330) * Nicola (1330 ‚Äì death 1333) * Francesco, Friars Minor (O.F.M.)

Some types of wooden slats and other types of organic material can be used for s'chach, unless they were processed for a different use.

As a maximum, there is a concept of being able to see the stars through the s'chach, but the absolute maximum is that rain should be able to penetrate into the sukkah. If the sukkah is kept year round, the s'chach must be replaced no more than 30 days before Sukkos.

Wright (March 25, 1874 ‚Äì August 20, 1961)www.slideshare.net was a Scottish-born inventor, researcher and chemical engineer at General Electric who invented Silly Putty in 1943 while looking for a replacement for rubber. The invention of Nutty Putty, later renamed Silly Putty, happened accidentally. During World War II, the United States couldn't obtain natural rubber from Asian suppliers, who gathered it from rubber trees. The General Electric Company was under a government contract to create an inexpensive substitute for synthetic rubber for the war effort. James Wright, an engineer at General Electric's New Haven laboratory, was working with silicone oil‚Äîa clear, gooey compound composed of silicon bonded to several other elements. By substituting silicon for carbon, the main element in rubber, Wright hoped to create a new compound with all the flexibility and bounce of rubber. In 1943, Wright made a surprising discovery. He mixed boric acid with silicone oil in a test tube. Instead of forming the hard rubber material he was looking for, the compound remained slightly gooey to the touch. Disappointed with the results, he tossed a gob of the material from the test tube onto the floor. To his surprise, the gob bounced. The new compound was very bouncy and could be stretched and pulled. However, it was not a good rubber substitute, so Wright and other GE scientists continued their search. Seven years later, a toy seller named Peter Hodgson packaged some of Wright's creation in a small plastic egg and presented his new product at the 1950 International Toy Fair in New York. Its first name was Nutty Putty but was changed later due to marketing concerns. It is now called Silly Putty; more than 300 million eggs containing the material have been sold since. Among Wright's other inventions for the General Electric Company were a method of restoring shrunken celluloid photographic films to their original condition, and a process of treating metals to protect against oxidation and corrosion.

Persia was sunk off Crete, while the passengers were having lunch, on 30 December 1915, by German World War I U-Boat ace Max Valentiner (commanding ). Persia sank in five to ten minutes, killing 343 of the 519 aboard. One reason for the large number of casualties was that only four of the lifeboats were successfully launched because of the list to port. The sinking was highly controversial, as it was argued that it broke naval international law that stated that merchant ships carrying a neutral flag could be stopped and searched for contraband but not sunk unless the passengers and crew were put in a place of safety (for which lifeboats on the open sea were not sufficient). The Persia was a British ship presenting itself openly to another belligerent. The U-Boat fired a torpedo and made no provision for any survivors, under Germany's policy of unrestricted submarine warfare but against the Imperial German Navy‚Äôs own restriction on attacking passenger liners, the Arabic pledge. At the time of sinking, Persia was carrying a large quantity of gold and jewels belonging to the Maharaja Jagatjit Singh, though he himself had disembarked at Marseilles. Among the passengers to survive were Walter E. Smith, a British Member of Parliament, Colonel Charles Clive Bigham, son of Lord Mersey, 2nd Lieutenant John Lionell Miller-Hallett of the Gurkha Rifles, and John Douglas-Scott-Montagu, 2nd Baron Montagu of Beaulieu. His secretary (and mistress) Eleanor Thornton, who many believe was the model for the Rolls-Royce \\"Spirit of Ecstasy\\" mascot by Charles Sykes, died. Also among the dead were Robert Ney McNeely, American Consul at Aden and a former North Carolina state senator from Union County, Robert Vane Russell, American missionary Rev. Homer Russell Salisbury and Frank Morris Coleman, the co-owner of Bennett, Coleman & Co. Ltd. The survivors on the four lifeboats were picked up during the second night after the sinking by the minesweeper . Only 15 of the women on board survived, among them British actress Ann Codrington (The Rossiter Case), who was pregnant with her daughter, Patricia Hilliard. Ann lost her mother, Mrs. Helen Codrington. Sixty-seven crewmen from the then Portuguese colony of Goa perished. Most of them were stewards.

Prusinkiewicz's main work is on the modeling of plant growth through such grammars. Prusinkiewicz received his PhD from the Warsaw University of Technology in 1978, and is currently a professor of Computer Science at the University of Calgary.

In 2006 Michael Hensel examined the work of Prusinkiewicz and his collaborators - the Calgary team - in an article published in Architectural Design. Hensel argued that the Calgary team's computational plant models or \\"virtual plants\\" which culminated in software they developed capable of modeling various plant characteristics, could provide important lessons for architectural design. Architects would learn from \\"the self- organisation processes underlying the growth of living organisms\\" and the Calgary team's work uncovered some of that potential. Their computational models allowed for a \\"quantitative understanding of developmental mechanisms\\" and had the potential to \\"lead to a synthetic understanding of the interplay between various aspects of development.\\" Prusinkiewicz's work was informed by that of the Hungarian biologist Aristid Lindenmayer who developed the theory of L-systems in 1968. Lindenmayer used L-systems to describe the behaviour of plant cells and to model the growth processes, plant development and the branching architecture of plant development.

It is east of Spezia, on the railway to Pisa, at the point where the railway to Parma diverges to the north. In 2010, it had a population of 21,978.  History  The position of Sarzana, at the entrance to the valley of the Magra (ancient Macra), the boundary between Etruria and Liguria in Roman times, gave it military importance in the Middle Ages. The first mention of the city is found in 983 in a diploma of Otto I; in 1202 the episcopal see was transferred from the ancient Luni, southeast, to Sarzana. Sarzana, owing to its position, changed masters more than once, belonging first to Pisa, then to Florence, then to the Banco di S. Giorgio of Genoa and from 1572 to dogal Genoa itself. The fortress of Sarzana.These changes left in Sarzana a conspicuous fortress, which remains a focus of attraction for people interested in military history and specifically in the history of fortifications (see Star fortress).Harris, J., \\"Sarzana and Sarzanello ‚Äì Transitional Design and Renaissance Designers\\", Fort (Fortress Study Group), No. 37, 2009, pp. 50‚Äì78 In 1814 it was assigned to the Kingdom of Sardinia, the frontier between Liguria and Tuscany being now made to run between it and Carrara. In 1921 Sarzana was the scene of fights () between the population and Mussolini's Fascist squads. During them, a small group of Carabinieri and, later, simple citizens opposed and pushed back some 300 armed Fascists who had come to devastate the town, resulting in 18 dead and about 30 injured.Bosworth, Mussolini's Italy, p. 173 During the German occupation of Italy in World War II, Sarzana was a centre of partisan resistance.  Ecclesiastical history  The Diocese of Sarzana was established on 4 August 1975, on territory reassigned from the suppressed Roman Catholic Diocese of Luni‚ÄìSarzana. It was immediately joined in personal union (aeque principaliter) with the bishopric of Brugnato and diocese of La Spezia from 4 August 1975 until their merger in 30 September 1986. On 30 September 1986 it was suppressed, its territory and titles being merged into the Diocese of La Spezia‚ÄìSarzana‚ÄìBrugnato, to which the bishop was appointed.

India has extremely diverse terrain, climate and vegetation, which comprises extremes of heat cold, desert and jungle, of low-lying plains and the highest mountains, of dryness and dampness, islands and continental areas, widely varying flora, and sharply marked seasons. India forms a large part of the Indomalayan biogeographical zone; many of the floral and faunal forms show Malayan affinities with some taxa being unique to the Indian region. In addition, India hosts three of the world's biodiversity hotspots: the Western Ghats, the Eastern Himalayas, and the hilly ranges bordering India and Myanmar, each having numerous endemic species. Accordingly, India's diverse and varied fauna include a rich variety of butterflies and moths. Brigadier William Harry Evans recorded approximately 1439 species of butterfly from British India, including Ceylon and Burma. After 1947, the rise of several new nations led to a reduction of the area forming part of India proper, and the number of species has been noted to be an estimated 1318 species.Cotton, Adam & Fric, Zdenek & Jit Gupta, Inder & Van Gasse, Paul & Inayoshi, Yutaka & Sin Khoon, Khew & G Kirton, Laurence & Larsen, Torben & Markhasiov, Maxim & Majumdar, Mridula & Pequin, Olivier & Rieger, Jiri & Motoki, Saito & P Smith, Colin & K Varshney, Rajendra & Smetacek, Peter.

Sloane (born May 11, 1936), a physician and Democrat, served two terms as Mayor of Louisville, Kentucky and also a term as county judge- executive of Jefferson County, Kentucky. He narrowly lost two Democratic primaries for Governor of Kentucky and lost a race for the United States Senate to incumbent Mitch McConnell. Early life Sloane grew up in an affluent family, graduated from Yale University and from the medical school at Case Western Reserve University. He worked as a surgeon in federal programs for the poor, including in eastern Kentucky and later in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. Returning to the United States in 1966, Sloane opened a community health center in Louisville's mostly black West End. He also developed Louisville's first emergency ambulance squads and was active in leading local efforts against air pollution. Mayor of Louisville In 1973 Sloane ran for mayor of Louisville. He faced Carroll Witten in the Democratic primary; Witten was president of the Board of Aldermen and favored to win, but Sloane upset him, winning in all twelve of Louisville's aldermanic wards. Sloane defeated Republican former police chief C. J. Hyde by a greater than two to one margin in the general election. Sloane's first term as mayor was from December 1, 1973 to December 1, 1977. Due to state law at the time, Sloane could not run for re-election as mayor. During his first term Louisville was hit by a tornado during the Super Outbreak on April 3, 1974 and faced a strike by sanitation workers that same year. A federal court ordered busing to desegregate Louisville's schools. Sloane established Louisville's mass transit system, the Transit Authority of River City (TARC), which is still in existence today. Sloane also began Louisville's Emergency Medical Service. Sloane also helped establish the Louisville Galleria project. In 1981 Sloane ran for a second term as mayor and won, defeating Republican nominee Louie R. Guenthner, Jr., a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives, by almost a two to one margin. A change in the law resulted in Sloane's second term beginning January 1, 1982 and ending January 1, 1986. Governor bids In 1979 Sloane ran for Governor of Kentucky but was narrowly defeated in a crowded Democratic primary by John Y. Brown, Jr. who went on to win the office. Sloane won 139,713 votes statewide to finish second; Brown won with 165,188. Terry McBrayer finished third with 131,530 votes, Congressman Carroll Hubbard finished fourth with 68,577 votes, Lieutenant Governor Thelma Stovall was fifth with 47,633 and four minor candidates split another 14,175 votes.1979 Kentucky Governor primary results at Kentucky Board of Elections site In 1983 Sloane ran for Governor of Kentucky a second time, losing by a small margin in the Democratic primary to Lieutenant Governor Martha Layne Collins. Sloane again finished second, winning 219,160 votes to Collins' 223,692; Grady Stumbo finished third with 199,795 and three minor candidates split 15,807 votes.1983 Kentucky Governor primary results at Kentucky Board of Elections site Post-mayoral and senate race As Sloane's second term as mayor came to an end he ran for the office of Jefferson County Judge-Executive and won, serving in that capacity from January 4, 1986 to January 1, 1990. He won the office by defeating Republican nominee George Clark by a two to one margin. In 1990 Sloane was the Democratic nominee for the United States Senate against incumbent Mitch McConnell. Governor Wallace G. Wilkinson, angry that Sloane had not supported him in the 1987 gubernatorial primary, had John Brock, the state superintendent of public instruction, run against Sloane in the Democratic primary for the Senate seat, exhausting some of Sloane's resources. Wilkinson refused to assist Sloane in the general election and the state Democratic party leadership, following the governor's lead, did little to assist Sloane. Despite these obstacles Sloane held McConnell to 52% of the vote but McConnell was reelected. The 1990 campaign would be Sloane's last in Kentucky. In 1991, with his term as judge-executive at an end, Sloane left Louisville to work on health care projects in Washington, D.C.. In 1995 Sloane became the public health commissioner for the District of Columbia but was later fired by Mayor Marion Barry because Sloane issued a public health advisory to boil water without notifying Barry first.

Droits of admiralty (English law) The term is used in English law in the phrase \\"droits of admiralty\\". This refers to certain customary rights or perquisites, formerly belonging to the Lord High Admiral, but now to the crown, for public purposes and paid into the Exchequer. These droits (see also wreck) consisted of flotsam, jetsam, ligan - (goods or wreckage on the sea bed that is attached to a buoy so that it can be recovered), treasure, deodand, derelict (maritime), within the admiral's jurisdiction; all fines, forfeitures, ransoms, recognizances and pecuniary punishments; all sturgeons, whales, porpoises, dolphins, grampuses and such large fishes; all ships and goods of the enemy coming into any creek, road or port, by durance or mistake; all ships seized at sea, salvage, etc., with the share of prizes such shares being afterwards called \\"tenths\\", in imitation of the French, who gave their admiral a droit de dixi√®me.

The station is owned by West Palm Beach, Florida- based Ion Media Networks. WIPL's transmitter is located in West Baldwin, Maine. History The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) granted a construction permit to original station owner Kennebec Valley Television in 1987. After ten years of delays related to difficulties in obtaining financing to construct the station and commence broadcasting, Kennebec Valley Television's corporate successor New England Broadcasting was granted an unbuilt station waiver and WPME signed on August 13, 1997 under a time brokerage agreement with WPXT owner Pegasus Communications Corporation. Prior to WPME's sign-on, viewers in Portland who wanted to watch UPN had to view it on cable via Boston's WSBK-TV. In February 2001, New England Broadcasting sold WPME to KB Prime Media LLC, which inherited the previous agreement with Pegasus. Pegasus Communications was permitted by the FCC to purchase WPME outright in February 2005 under the previously-granted unbuilt station waiver. The station maintained a primary affiliation with UPN and secondary affiliation with The WB. It aired WB prime time on a tape delay starting at 10. When WPXT switched its affiliation from Fox to The WB, this secondary affiliation was dropped. WPME aired Boston Celtics and Bruins games in the late 1990s and Red Sox baseball until 2002. The Red Sox, owning half of cable sports network NESN, moved the games to that network. This station's only attempt at local news was a 7 o'clock broadcast (produced by WPXT) in 2001 which was quickly canceled due to low ratings and inconsistent viewership. The station did not air a prime time newscast at 10 p.m. like many other UPN affiliates because it would compete with WPXT's nightly broadcast. However, that station's show was simulcasted on WPME for a period of time. Pegasus declared bankruptcy in June 2004 over a dispute with DirecTV over marketing of the direct broadcast satellite service in rural areas. The Pegasus station group was sold in August 2006 to private investment firm CP Media, LLC of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, for $55.5 million. CP Media eventually formed a new broadcasting company, New Age Media. In the wake of the merger of The WB and UPN into The CW, WPXT was announced as that network's Portland affiliate on March 9, 2006. WPME would then announce it would associate with MyNetworkTV on May 1, a network owned by News Corporation that was made up of stations which would not become CW affiliates. WPME joined the network on its launch date, September 5, 2006. It would be the only MyNetworkTV affiliate in Maine until December 6, 2006, when Bangor Fox affiliate WFVX-LD took a secondary affiliation with the network. On June 27, 2008, WPME signed-on a new second digital subchannel to be the \\"Maine Visitor's Channel\\" (which was dropped in October 2014 to make room for Movies!) and a third subchannel to be QVC (replaced by Laff on November 7, 2016). It ceased transmission in analog on September 18, 2008 ten months prior to the revised FCC digital switchover deadline of June 12, 2009. Throughout its history, the station has also produced and aired several local programs. From 2009 to 2013 this has included a simulcast of conservative weekday morning program The Ray Richardson Show produced by WLOB, which was seen for an hour from 6:30 until 7:30 featuring short features and news stories from Fox News Radio, local weather forecasts on WPME during commercial breaks, as well as live call-ins from viewers and listeners along with in-studio guests. The broadcast originated from WLOB's facility on Warren Avenue in Portland's Riverton section. Fellow MyNetworkTV affiliate WZMY-TV, based in Derry, New Hampshire, with service to southern areas of the state and Greater Boston, laid off several employees as part of an overall strategy change in December 2009. Although that station continued to be licensed to Shooting Star Broadcasting, an outsourcing agreement was established with New Age Media resulting in WZMY becoming a sister outlet to WPME. The move was designed to streamline operations and some of its programming options in order to be more hyper-local. The arrangement ended after WZMY was sold to Carlisle One Media, becoming WBIN-TV, in 2011; it is now Univision Communications-owned WWJE-DT. MPS Media announced in March 2012 that it would sell WPME to Triumph Broadcasting for $75,000. The deal was contingent on WPXT's concurrent sale from New Age Media to Tyche Broadcasting. On November 13, 2012, WPME filed a non-consummation notice to the FCC, meaning the transaction was made null and void. On February 13, 2013, MPS Media filed to sell WPME to Cottonwood Communications; this deal was concurrent with the sale of WPXT to Ironwood Communications, which took over WPME's operations through a shared services agreement. The FCC granted its approval of the sale on April 2. The sale was consummated on May 20. On July 2, 2015, Ironwood chose to exercise an option to acquire WPME outright for $65,000; the company sought a failed station waiver, as there are not enough stations in the Portland market to permit a duopoly without a waiver. Ion Media Networks agreed to buy WPME from Ironwood Communications for $900,000 on December 4, 2017; under a shared services agreement, Ironwood will continue to provide services to the station. The sale did not include WPME's programming contracts. Ahead of the sale's closing, MyNetworkTV, Escape and Laff programming was moved to the third, fourth and fifth subchannels of WPXT on March 22, 2018.www.ourmaine.com The sale was completed on March 29, 2018, at which time the station's call letters were changed to WIPL.Ion Media closes on WPME Portland, Maine TVNewsCheck, April 2, 2018Callsign Listing.

He was a son of Miran Shah and a grandson of Timur. Biography During Timur's lifetime, Khalil Sultan gained Timur's particular favor. He distinguished himself during the campaign in India and in 1402 was given rule of the Ferghana Valley. Upon Timur's death in 1405 Khalil viewed himself as his successor. Timur's appointed successor Pir Muhammad was quickly cast aside, and Khalil gained control of Samarkand. Khalil gained Timur's treasury and bestowed the puppet title of Chagatai Khan (which before had always been granted by Timur to a descendant of Genghis Khan to legitimize his rule) to a Timurid prince. Khalil also gained an ally, Sultan Husayn Tayichiud, who had previously also made claims to the throne as a grandson of Timur.Roemer, p. 100 Meanwhile, Shahrukh Mirza, who was ruling in Herat, also decided to press his claims. He advanced to the Oxus River against Khalil but turned back when Khalil's father Miran Shah, as well as his brother Abu Bakr ibn Miran Shah, marched from Azerbaijan in support. Nevertheless, Khalil's position began to weaken. He was unpopular in Samarkand, where the nobility despised his wife Shad Mulk. The latter had considerable influence over Khalil, convincing him to appoint people of so-called low birth to high positions at the expense of the nobility. A famine caused him to be even more despised. He decided to return to the Ferghana Valley with his former mentor, Khudaidad Hussain, who went to Moghulistan (the realm of the eastern Chagatai Khans) in an attempt to win their support.Roemer, pp. 100‚Äì1 However, Persian historian Khwandamir instead claims that Khudaidad Hussain began a civil war against Khalil and took him prisoner, delivering him along with his territory to eastern Chagatai Khan Shams-i-Jahan (r. 1399‚Äì1408). Shams-i-Jahan, however, had Khudaidad Hussain executed for his treason to Khalil and returned Khalil his kingdom.Stevens, John. The history of Persia.

Khalil's rule in Samarkand finally ended when Shahrukh Mirza entered the city unopposed on May 13, 1409. Transoxiana was then given to Shahrukh Mirza's son Ulugh Beg. Khalil decided to surrender to Shahrukh Mirza, who had captured Shad Mulk. He received his wife back, and was appointed governor of Ray. He died there in 1411.

Some were executed; some were released but lost their civil rights. The first incident (in 166) was largely bloodless, but the second incident (in 169), which came after the Confucian scholars Dou Wu (the father of Empress Dowager Dou) and Chen Fan were defeated by eunuchs in a physical confrontation, saw a large number of the partisans lose their lives. The restrictions on civil liberties imposed on the surviving partisans were not lifted until 184 when Emperor Ling was concerned that the partisans would join the Yellow Turban Rebellion. First Disaster of the Partisan Prohibitions The root of the first Disaster of the Partisan Prohibitions came perhaps in 159, when, with the support of five powerful eunuchs, Emperor Huan was able to overthrow the yoke of the domineering Liang Ji, the brother of both his former regent Empress Dowager Liang and his wife Empress Liang N√ºying, in a coup d'√©tat. He put the five eunuchs and their associates into powerful positions, and these eunuchs and their supporters became extremely corrupt. As a result, a number of Confucian officials who served in the imperial administration began a conscious effort to form a coalition to drive out the influence of the eunuchs. In the realm of public opinion, they were supported by university students in the capital, who admired them greatly and adored them as heroes against eunuch domination. For several years, there was somewhat of balance and counterbalance of power at court; at times the officials would successfully accuse the eunuchs of wrongdoing, and those accused eunuchs would lose power; at times the officials would be unsuccessful and instead be driven out of government by the eunuchs. The matter came to a head in 166 over a murder case. Zhang Cheng (ÂºµÊàê), a fortuneteller in Luoyang, had foretold that a general pardon would be forthcoming, and he therefore instructed his son to commit a murder. Li Ying, one of the foremost Confucian scholars in government who was serving as the governor of the capital province, arrested the Zhangs, but at this time a general pardon was issued. Li, in anger, disregarded the pardon and executed the Zhangs anyway. However, Li did not anticipate that eunuchs friendly to Zhang would then accuse Li and the other officials of encouraging university students to criticize government and the emperor. Emperor Huan became extremely enraged, and while Chen Fan, who was then the commander of the armed forces, opposed drastic actions, Emperor Huan disregarded his opposition and went ahead and arrested Li and two ministers, Du Mi (ÊùúÂØÜ) and Chen Xiang (Èô≥Áøî), as well as some 200 university students. Emperor Huan also issued an arrest order for other university students‚Äîand it was this arrest order that coined the term \\"the partisans.\\" Chen Fan continued to protest, and was removed from his post. The next year (167), Dou Wu submitted a humble petition requesting leniency for the partisans and tendering his resignation. Another official, Huo Xu (ÈúçË¨£), also submitted a similar petition. Further, the eunuchs became concerned that the university students' interrogation logs often mentioned their own younger family members, and therefore also wanted the investigation to end. Therefore, under their urging, Li, Du, Chen, and the university students were released and exiled back to their original home commanderies. Their civil liberties were stripped for life. Restoration of rights under Empress Dowager Dou's regency Early 168, Emperor Huan died without an heir. Empress Dou became empress dowager and regent, and her father Dou Wu and Chen Fan became the leading officials at court. They selected Liu Hong (ÂäâÂÆè), the 12-year-old Marquess of Jieduting, as the new emperor (as Emperor Ling). Empress Dou continued to serve as regent. Under the advice of her father and Chen, she restored the rights of the partisans, and in fact made many of them imperial officials. Later in 168, concerned that the eunuchs were exerting too much influence with the young emperor and the empress dowager, Dou Wu and Chen entered into a plan to exterminate the leading eunuchs. When word got out, the eunuchs instead incarcerated Empress Dowager Dou to get her seal and mobilized the imperial guards and had Chen arrested and executed. Dou Wu resisted, but was defeated after a short campaign in and near the capital, and he committed suicide. The eunuchs immediately removed the partisans from government and again suspended their civil liberties. Second Disaster of the Partisan Prohibitions The eunuchs were not content with just removing the partisans from government. In 169, they persuaded the 13-year-old Emperor Ling that the partisans were intent on rebellion. The leading partisans, including Li, Du, Fan Pang (ËåÉÊªÇ), were arrested and executed. Overall, about 100 people lost their lives. Many partisans hid, with the assistance of an underground network who largely renamed anonymous even later, but included such eventually- important figures as Yuan Shao and Kong Rong. The partisans who were not on the arrest rolls had their liberties further restricted. End In 184, after the start of the Yellow Turban Rebellion, one of the eunuchs who sympathized with the partisans, L√º Qiang (ÂëÇÂº∑), persuaded Emperor Ling that if he did not pardon the partisans, they might join the Yellow Turban Rebellion and inflict great damage on the imperial administration. Emperor Ling therefore granted the partisans a full pardon and restored their civil liberties. (As a result, though, L√º himself would become a victim of the wrath of his fellow eunuchs, and he was falsely accused of conspiring to depose the emperor later that year. He committed suicide.)

Early life Baker was born in Louisville, Kentucky. His mother was black, and his father, whom he never met, was believed to be white. In 1936, at the age of 11, Baker was put into an orphanage. He ran away frequently, and had to be retrieved by the staff from St. Louis, New York City, Chicago, and Pittsburgh. Eventually the orphanage quit looking for him, and at the age of 16 he stayed in New York City. He found work as a laborer and then a dishwasher. But after hanging out in the pool halls of 26th Street, he gave up work to become a full-time pool shark. At 19, Baker decided to make a change in his life. He went back to dishwashing, and was determined to become a jazz musician. The trumpet was his first choice for an instrument, but with only $14 saved up, he could not find a pawnshop with anything but guitars for that price.Liner notes for The Legendary Mickey Baker by Stefan Grossman He enrolled at The New York School of Music, but found the learning pace too slow. He dropped out and resolved to teach himself, but gave up shortly afterwards. Six months later he met a street guitarist who inspired him to start playing again. He continued taking private lessons from different teachers over the next few years. His musical style was influenced by saxophonist Charlie Parker. Career By 1949, Baker had his own combo, and a few paying jobs. He decided to move west, but found that audiences there were not receptive to progressive jazz music. Baker was stranded without work in California when he saw a show by blues guitarist Pee Wee Crayton. Baker said of the encounter: \\"I asked Pee Wee, 'You mean you can make money playing that stuff on guitar?' Here he was driving a big white Eldorado and had a huge bus for his band. So I started bending strings. I was starving to death, and the blues was just a financial thing for me then.\\" He found a few jobs in Richmond, California, and made enough money to return to New York. After returning east, Baker began recording for Savoy, King and Atlantic Records. He did sessions with Doc Pomus, The Drifters, Ray Charles, Ivory Joe Hunter, Ruth Brown, Big Joe Turner, Louis Jordan, Coleman Hawkins, and numerous other artists. Inspired by the success of Les Paul & Mary Ford, he formed the pop duo Mickey & Sylvia (with Sylvia Robinson, one of his guitar students) in the mid-1950s. Together, they had a hit single with \\"Love Is Strange\\" in 1956. After the duo split up in the late 1958, Baker recorded with Kitty Noble as Mickey & Kitty. They released three records on Atlantic Records in 1959. In late 1959, Baker released his debut solo album, The Wildest Guitar, on Atlantic. Mickey& Sylvia reunited in 1960 and sporadically worked together on additional tracks until the mid-1960s. Around this time, that he moved to France, where he worked with Ronnie Bird and Chantal Goya and made a few solo records. He would remain in France for the rest of his life. Up until the end of his life, Baker was rarely without work. Baker appeared at the 1975 version of the Roskilde Festival. Because Baker revealed very few details about his private life, reasons for his move to France were never made completely clear. Some media sources claimed that Baker had grown tired of the business aspects of the commercial music industry in the United States, while others stated that the bi-racial Baker was angered by the growing rate of hate crimes in the southern United States during the burgeoning civil rights movement. Personal life Baker guarded his personal life as much as possible, giving few interviews and only making sporadic public appearances. After moving to France, he rarely left the country, and made very few trips to the United States. Baker was married six times. Among his wives were Barbara Castellano from the mid-1950s to the mid-1970s, and Marie France-Drei, a singer with whom he stayed from the early 1980s until his death. Baker had two children: a son, MacHouston, Jr., and a daughter, Bonita Lee. Death Baker died on November 27, 2012 near Toulouse, France, aged 87. His wife, Marie, said he died of heart and kidney failure.  Books  Baker's self-tuition method book series, the Complete Course in Jazz Guitar is a mainstay for introducing students of guitar to the world of jazz. They have remained in print for over 50 years. Awards and honors In 1999, Baker received the Pioneer Award from the Rhythm and Blues Foundation. In 2003, Baker was listed at No. 53 on Rolling Stone's \\"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\\". In 2004, \\"Love Is Strange\\" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

It stars American actor Anthony Quinn and Italian actress Gina Lollobrigida. The film is the first version of the novel to be made in color. In the tradition of many sword and sandal spectacles, Quinn and Lollobrigida are the only two actors in the film who actually speak in English; the rest of the cast is made up of French actors who have had their voices dubbed into English. Anthony Quinn's portrayal of the hunchback Quasimodo is more human and less horrific than most other portrayals. Instead of having a huge hump and a hideously deformed face, he only has a small curve in his spine and a slightly deformed face. Ending The film is one of the few adaptations to use Victor Hugo's original ending; although Esmeralda is killed by a stray arrow rather than hanged. Esmeralda's last words were: \\"Life is wonderful\\" (\\"C'est beau, la vie\\"). A voiceover narration tells us at the end that several years afterward, an excavation group finds the skeletons of Quasimodo and Esmeralda intertwined in an embrace.

Distributions are used to build up notions of integrability, and specifically of a foliation of a manifold. Even though they share the same name, distributions we discuss in this article have nothing to do with distributions in the sense of analysis. Definition Let M be a C^\\\\infty manifold of dimension m, and let n \\\\leq m. Suppose that for each x \\\\in M, we assign an n-dimensional subspace \\\\Delta_x \\\\subset T_x(M) of the tangent space in such a way that for a neighbourhood N_x \\\\subset M of x there exist n linearly independent smooth vector fields X_1,\\\\ldots,X_n such that for any point y \\\\in N_x, span \\\\\\\\{ X_1(y),\\\\ldots,X_n(y) \\\\\\\\} = \\\\Delta_y. We let \\\\Delta refer to the collection of all the \\\\Delta_x for all x \\\\in M and we then call \\\\Delta a distribution of dimension n on M, or sometimes a C^\\\\infty n-plane distribution on M. The set of smooth vector fields \\\\\\\\{ X_1,\\\\ldots,X_n \\\\\\\\} is called a local basis of \\\\Delta. Involutive distributions We say that a distribution \\\\Delta on M is involutive if for every point x \\\\in M there exists a local basis \\\\\\\\{ X_1,\\\\ldots,X_n \\\\\\\\} of the distribution in a neighbourhood of x such that for all 1 \\\\leq i, j \\\\leq n, [X_i,X_j] (the Lie bracket of two vector fields) is in the span of \\\\\\\\{ X_1,\\\\ldots,X_n \\\\\\\\}. That is, if [X_i,X_j] is a linear combination of \\\\\\\\{ X_1,\\\\ldots,X_n \\\\\\\\}. Normally this is written as [ \\\\Delta , \\\\Delta ] \\\\subset \\\\Delta. Involutive distributions are the tangent spaces to foliations. Involutive distributions are important in that they satisfy the conditions of the Frobenius theorem, and thus lead to integrable systems. A related idea occurs in Hamiltonian mechanics: two functions f and g on a symplectic manifold are said to be in mutual involution if their Poisson bracket vanishes. Generalized distributions A generalized distribution, or Stefan-Sussmann distribution, is similar to a distribution, but the subspaces \\\\Delta_x \\\\subset T_xM are not required to all be of the same dimension. The definition requires that the \\\\Delta_x are determined locally by a set of vector fields, but these will no longer be linearly independent everywhere. It is not hard to see that the dimension of \\\\Delta_x is lower semicontinuous, so that at special points the dimension is lower than at nearby points. One class of examples is furnished by a non-free action of a Lie group on a manifold, the vector fields in question being the infinitesimal generators of the group action (a free action gives rise to a genuine distribution). Another arises in dynamical systems, where the set of vector fields in the definition is the set of vector fields that commute with a given one. There are also examples and applications in Control theory, where the generalized distribution represents infinitesimal constraints of the system.  References  * William M. Boothby. Section IV. 8.

Perelman's solution of the Poincar√© conjecture uses a version of the Harnack inequality, found by , for the Ricci flow. Harnack's inequality is used to prove Harnack's theorem about the convergence of sequences of harmonic functions. Harnack's inequality can also be used to show the interior regularity of weak solutions of partial differential equations. The statement A harmonic function (green) over a disk (blue) is bounded from above by a function (red) that coincides with the harmonic function at the disk center and approaches infinity towards the disk boundary. Harnack's inequality applies to a non-negative function f defined on a closed ball in Rn with radius R and centre x0. It states that, if f is continuous on the closed ball and harmonic on its interior, then for every point x with x ‚àí x0 = r < R, : \\\\frac{1-(r/R)} {[1+(r/R)]^{n-1}} f(x_0)\\\\le f(x) \\\\le {1+(r/R)\\\\over [1 - (r/R)]^{n-1}} f(x_0). In the plane R2 (n = 2) the inequality can be written: :{R-r\\\\over R+r} f(x_0)\\\\le f(x)\\\\le {R+r\\\\over R-r}f(x_0). For general domains \\\\Omega in \\\\mathbf{R}^n the inequality can be stated as follows: If \\\\omega is a bounded domain with \\\\bar{\\\\omega} \\\\subset \\\\Omega, then there is a constant C such that : \\\\sup_{x \\\\in \\\\omega} u(x) \\\\le C \\\\inf_{x \\\\in \\\\omega} u(x) for every twice differentiable, harmonic and nonnegative function u(x). The constant C is independent of u; it depends only on the domains \\\\Omega and \\\\omega. Proof of Harnack's inequality in a ball By Poisson's formula : f(x) = \\\\frac 1 {\\\\omega_{n-1}} \\\\int_{y-x_0=R} \\\\frac{R^2 -r^2}{Rx - y^n} \\\\cdot f(y) \\\\, dy, where œân ‚àí 1 is the area of the unit sphere in Rn and r = x ‚àí x0. Since : R-r \\\\le x-y \\\\le R+r, the kernel in the integrand satisfies : \\\\frac{R -r}{R (R+r)^{n-1}} \\\\le \\\\frac{R^2 -r^2}{Rx-y^n}\\\\le \\\\frac{R+r}{R(R-r)^{n-1}}. Harnack's inequality follows by substituting this inequality in the above integral and using the fact that the average of a harmonic function over a sphere equals its value at the center of the sphere: : f(x_0)= \\\\frac 1 {R^{n-1}\\\\omega_{n-1}} \\\\int_{y-x_0=R} f(y)\\\\, dy. Elliptic partial differential equations For elliptic partial differential equations, Harnack's inequality states that the supremum of a positive solution in some connected open region is bounded by some constant times the infimum, possibly with an added term containing a functional norm of the data: : \\\\sup u \\\\le C ( \\\\inf u + \\\\f\\\\) The constant depends on the ellipticity of the equation and the connected open region. Parabolic partial differential equations There is a version of Harnack's inequality for linear parabolic PDEs such as heat equation. Let \\\\mathcal{M} be a smooth (bounded) domain in \\\\mathbb{R}^n and consider the linear elliptic operator : \\\\mathcal{L}u=\\\\sum_{i,j=1}^n a_{ij}(t,x)\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x_i\\\\,\\\\partial x_j} + \\\\sum_{i=1}^n b_i(t,x)\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x_i} + c(t,x)u with smooth and bounded coefficients and a positive definite matrix (a_{ij}). Suppose that u(t,x)\\\\in C^2((0,T)\\\\times\\\\mathcal{M}) is a solution of : \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t}-\\\\mathcal{L}u=0 in (0,T)\\\\times\\\\mathcal{M} such that : \\\\quad u(t,x)\\\\ge0 \\\\text{ in } (0,T)\\\\times\\\\mathcal{M}. Let K be compactly contained in \\\\mathcal{M} and choose \\\\tau\\\\in(0,T). Then there exists a constant C > 0 (depending only on K, \\\\tau, t-\\\\tau, and the coefficients of \\\\mathcal{L}) such that, for each t\\\\in(\\\\tau,T), : \\\\sup_K u(t-\\\\tau,\\\\cdot)\\\\le C \\\\inf_K u(t,\\\\cdot).

It reached the #2 position on the New York Times Best Seller List in the \\"Advice, How-To, and Miscellaneous\\" category. Publication Maddox announced the book on February 22, 2005, and announced its title to a mailing list on October 18, 2005. An art contest was held on the website to pick the illustrators. The book was officially completed on January 19, 2006, as announced on Maddox's website. The book first appeared in Barnes and Noble bookstores during May 2006, and it arrived to those who pre-ordered it on June 1, 2006. The book debuted at #4 on the New York Times Best Seller list for \\"Advice, How-To, and Miscellaneous,\\" and remained on the list for ten weeks. The book was published by Kensington in the United States and was published by Penguin in the United Kingdom. The 224-page long book is dedicated to Maddox himself: \\"To the love of my life, my soul mate, and the greatest person in the world: Me.\\" Several parts of the UK version were removed, perhaps the most notable omission being the \\"headbutt to the ovaries\\" section of the first chapter (\\"A - Ass-Kicking\\"). The edition also contains a disclaimer. On February 20, 2009, Maddox announced on the book's web site that he is \\"working on a new edition of The Alphabet of Manliness,\\" and that \\"the new edition will be expanded and revised, and will include The Numbers of Manliness.\\" Sections The book consists of 26 short sections, each corresponding to a letter of the alphabet. * A - Ass-Kicking * B - Boner * C - Copping a Feel * D - Dump, Taking a * E - Enlightenment * F - Female Wrestling * G - Gas * H - Hot Sauce * I - Irate * J - Jerky, Beef * K - Knockers * L - Lumberjack * M - Metal * N - Norris, Chuck * O - Obedience * P - Pirates * Q - Quickies * R - Road Rage * S - Sneaking a Peek * T - Taunting * U - Urinal Etiquette * V - Violence * W - Winner * X - XXX * Y - Yelling * Z - (Office) Zombies Illustrators * Bryan Douglas * Justina Fader * Louis Fernet-Leclair * Jim Moore * John Petersen * Thomas Pollock Jr. * Leah Tiscione * Angelo Vildasol Book signing tour After the official release of The Alphabet of Manliness, Maddox went on a book signing tour in several states, starting in his home state of Utah. The first leg of his tour took him from Salt Lake City to the East Coast and Midwest of the United States. The second leg of the tour to the West Coast started on July 13, 2006, ending on July 29, 2006. On this tour he dressed himself in a large royal gown and was wearing a crown on his head. This provoked many people to get down on their hands and knees in front of him, often kissing his hand. On the book's website, Maddox also jokingly listed a set of rules for fans, such as barring eye contact or talking directly to him (referring to an urban legend about popular figures such as Hillary Clinton and Shania Twain), formal dress attire, and remaining at least three feet (1 yard) away at all times. Extended Edition The Alphabet of Manliness: Extended Edition came out on August 25, 2009. It contains an epilogue, 36 additional pages about \\"The Numbers of Manliness\\", and eight full-color inserts. Another book tour took place as well.

Biography He attended the Lexington, Illinois public schools and earned a B.S. from Illinois Wesleyan University in 1945 as well as a B.M. from Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago in 1948. He received an M.D. from Northwestern in 1949 as well as a J.D. from Washburn University Law School in Topeka, Kansas, 1970. He did his obstetrics and gynecology residency at Detroit Receiving Hospital. Roy served in the United States Air Force from 1953 to 1955, and was a military doctor at Forbes Air Force Base in Topeka; he was discharged with rank of captain. He practiced medicine in Topeka from 1955 to 1970 and was elected as a Democrat to the Ninety-second and Ninety-third Congresses (January 3, 1971 - January 3, 1975). He changed his registration in 1970 to run as a Democrat. He did not run for reelection to the House in 1974, but instead ran for the United States Senate. In a bitter race, he lost to incumbent Senator Bob Dole only by a few thousand votes, which was the closest margin of Dole's congressional career. In a 1996 interview with PBS, he explained his decision to seek election to the Senate, saying, \\"I was far from an admirer of Bob Dole, I'll tell you that. He'd been around and he had been pretty much a hatchet man, both in Kansas, and as far as President Nixon was concerned. And so I saw it as a wonderful opportunity to take him out of politics, which I thought was very important at that time.\\" He ran for the U.S. Senate again in 1978 but lost to Nancy Kassebaum. He resumed the practice of medicine in Topeka until 1989. He sought a rematch with Kassebaum in 1990 won the Democratic Primary but dropped out of the race citing personal issues. His replacement was runner up Dick Williams. Since 1989, Roy was a regular columnist for The Topeka Capital-Journal. His columns often reflected a liberal perspective, including support for abortion rights and opposition to the policies of President George W. Bush. His 2001-2002 columns in The Topeka Metro News rallied sentiment to stop the sale of Kansas Blue Cross Blue Shield to Anthem of Indianapolis.

The name kinjiki is a euphemism for homosexuality. The kanji Á¶Å means \\"forbidden\\" and Ëâ≤ in this case means \\"erotic love\\", although it can also mean \\"color\\". The word \\"kinjiki\\" also means colors that were forbidden to be worn by people of various ranks in the Japanese court. It describes a marriage of a gay man to a young woman. Like Mishima's earlier novel Confessions of a Mask, it is generally considered somewhat autobiographical. Plot summary Aging, cynical Shunsuke is one of postwar Japan's most respected authors. While vacationing at an exclusive Japanese resort, he meets Yuichi, a stunningly gorgeous young man of limited means and intellect who is engaged to a prim, conventional young woman from a very well- to-do family. While he needs the marriage for financial reasons, Yuichi innocently confides to the older man that he feels no real physical desire for his bride, or for any woman. The crafty Shunsuke senses an opportunity to mold the malleable, gullible young man into an exquisite weapon of revenge against the female sex as a whole. He tells Yuichi that his inability to feel desire for women is not a weakness but potentially a tremendous source of strength. He advises the young man to go through with the marriage and gain financial security, but also to omit no opportunity to experiment with the emotions of others, and to have as many affairs as possible with both women and men. Themes There are many elements Mishima touches on. Two involving the main characters, Yuichi and Shunsuke, are: * Homosexuality: Yuichi's pursuit of his homosexual nature is a driving force of the narrative. Shunsuke's contempt for women leads him to admire Yuichi, whom he feels is incapable of loving women. * Misogyny: Both Yuichi and Shunsuke have contempt for women, and this drives their behavior. The most basic thematic element is the clash of opposites: * Beauty and Ugliness: Yuichi is considered the pinnacle of beauty, while Shunsuke considers himself to be extremely ugly. * Youth and Aging: The young and old are played against each other. The youthful Yuichi and elderly Shunsuke are at odds, though they are conspirators. The young Kyoko and the mature Mrs. Kaburagi are played against each other for Yuichi's affection. * Life and Death: Shunsuke is obsessed with death and feels it is more powerful than life. * Double Lives/Alter-Egos: Yuichi's entrance into the world of Tokyo's homosexuals causes him problems, as he must hide his nature from his wife and the world at large. Reception Hortense Calisher said the book had a poor reception in the west, but also argued that Mishima \\"is never limited enough to treat of sex alone.\\" Adaptations The first butoh piece was an adaptation of Kinjiki by Tatsumi Hijikata, which premiered in 1959. The title of the novel was used by David Sylvian and Ryuichi Sakamoto as the name of their theme song for the film soundtrack of Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence, a film set in a Japanese POW camp in Java which includes exploration of homoerotic themes.

Gary Gray and starring Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Edward Norton, Jason Statham, Seth Green, Mos Def and Donald Sutherland. An American remake of the 1969 British film, the plot follows a motley crew of thieves who plan to steal gold from a former associate who double-crossed them. Despite the shared title, the plot and characters of this film differ from those of its source material; Gray described the film as \\"an homage to the original.\\" Most of the film was shot on location in Venice and Los Angeles, where canals and streets, respectively, were temporarily shut down during principal photography. Distributed by Paramount Pictures, The Italian Job was theatrically released in the United States on May 30, 2003, and grossed over $176 million worldwide. Critical response was largely positive, with publications highlighting the action sequences, performances of the cast and humor. A sequel, The Brazilian Job, has reportedly been in development since 2004, but has yet to be produced as of 2020.  Plot  John Bridger, a professional safecracker, has assembled a team to steal 35 million dollars worth of gold bullion from a safe in Venice, held by Italian gangsters who had stolen it weeks earlier. The team includes Charlie Croker, a professional fixer; Lyle or \\"Napster\\", a computer expert; Handsome Rob, their wheelman; Steve, their inside man; and Left Ear, their explosives expert. The heist is successful, but as they drive towards Austria with the bullion, they are stopped by men loyal to Steve, who had turned on them and takes the bullion for himself. Steve kills John when he admonishes him, and Rob drives the van over a bridge into the waters below to protect the others, using air tanks from the heist to stay alive. Steve leaves them for dead. A year later in the United States, Charlie learns that Steve has resurfaced under a new identity and is laundering the gold through a Ukrainian jeweler named Yevhen to finance his lavish lifestyle in Los Angeles. Charlie gathers the team, and also recruits John's daughter Stella, a skilled private safe cracker, offering her the chance to get revenge on Steve for her father's death. They stake out Steve's mansion, and Stella, disguising herself as a cable technician, is able to map out its interior, allowing them to determine the location of Steve's safe containing the bullion. Coincidentally, Steve, unaware of Stella's identity, offers to go out on a date with her. Charlie and Stella devise a plan using explosives to blow the safe while Steve is away on his supposed date, using three heavily modified Mini Coopers to transport the gold out of the mansion. Charlie enlists the help of Skinny Pete for the explosives and Wrench to make the modifications on the cars. As Steve continues to launder the gold bars, Yevhen accidentally reveals that he knows about the Venice heist. Covering his tracks, Steve kills Yevhen which infuriates Mashkov, Yevhen's cousin and a leader of a Ukrainian crime family. When Charlie and his group embark on the night of the planned heist, they find Steve's neighbors are having a party. As the explosives would draw undue attention, they abandon their plan. Stella ends up having to meet Steve after all and inadvertently gives away her identity by using similar phrases to her father. When the team arrives to help protect her, Steve taunts them that he still has the upper hand, to which Charlie responds by punching him in the nose. Mashkov connects the murder to Charlie through Skinny Pete. Uneased by this, Steve makes plans to transport the gold to Mexico City by a private plane from Los Angeles International Airport after transporting it there in an armored car. Napster hears of this through his tap on Steve's phone, and Charlie and his gang make a new plan to steal the gold en route to the airport by hijacking the city's traffic control system to force the armored car to a planned spot where they will execute the heist. On the day of transport, they are surprised when three armored trucks leave Steve's mansion, but Napster is able to determine which one carries the bullion, and manipulates the traffic accordingly. Knowing that Steve is monitoring the transport by helicopter, they get the car to the target spot and then create a diversion as they detonate explosives to drop the part of the road with the car into the old subway tunnels below. After opening the truck, they find a different safe to the one that held the gold before. Although she struggles initially, Stella cracks the safe, and they load up the Coopers with the gold. They race from the subway to the Los Angeles River and through the city, pursued by Steve's henchmen on motorcycles, with Napster helping to create a green wave to evade traffic. After Charlie disables his helicopter by having his Mini Cooper damage the tail rotors, Steve abandons it and steals a Ford Bronco in anger to follow them to Union Station. At Union Station, the cars are loaded onto a train car with the help of Wrench. Steve arrives shortly thereafter and after bribing Wrench, is surprised to find Charlie and the others waiting for him. Steve brandishes a gun and demands his gold back, but Mashkov arrives with his heavily armed men, forcing Steve to drop his gun; Charlie explains that he has offered Mashkov part of the gold and Steve in exchange for helping with security protection. Steve is punched in the face by Stella before being taken away by Mashkov, who reveals he will be tortured in retaliation for Yevhen's death. The group boards the train as it departs to New Orleans, and celebrate in John's honor. The epilogue shows them all having used their share of the gold for their own desired purposes; Handsome Rob purchases an Aston Martin Vanquish, getting pulled over by a beautiful policewoman, Left Ear buys a mansion in southern Spain with a room for his shoe collection, while Napster buys a powerful stereo capable of blowing a woman's clothes off. Meanwhile, Charlie takes John's advice about finding someone he wants to spend the rest of his life with, and he and Stella travel to Venice together.  Cast  * Mark Wahlberg as Charlie Croker, the team's mastermind and thief, who seeks revenge for the murder of his mentor, John Bridger. * Charlize Theron as Stella Bridger, John's daughter and a safe and vault \\"technician\\". She prefers the use of technology to crack safes for the police, unlike her father, who did the whole thing by touch. * Edward Norton as Steve Frazelli, the \\"inside man\\" during the Venice heist who later betrays Charlie, John, Rob, Lyle and \\"Left Ear\\", and leaves them for dead. * Donald Sutherland as John Bridger, Stella's father and safecracker whose methods are \\"old-fashioned\\", handled entirely by touch. He is Charlie's longtime partner. * Jason Statham as Handsome Rob, the team's wheelman and a ladies' man. According to Charlie, he set the record for the world's longest freeway chase and received 110 love letters sent to his jail cell from women who saw him on the news. * Seth Green as Lyle, the team's computer expert. He claims he is the real inventor of Napster, saying that Shawn Fanning, who was his roommate at Northeastern University back in 1999, stole the idea from him. * Mos Def as Gilligan \\"Left Ear\\", the team's demolition and explosives expert. His name comes from an incident during his childhood when he put too many M-80s in a toilet bowl and lost the hearing in his right ear. * Franky G as Wrench, a mechanic who Rob contacts to engineer the Minis to carry the gold. He also assists in planting explosives to drop the armored car into the subway, where he serves as the lookout. * Boris Lee Krutonog as Yevhen, a jewelry store owner with ties to the Ukrainian mob. Hired by Steve to help sell the gold, Steve shoots him after realizing that he knows too much about where the gold came from. * Aleksander Krupa as Mashkov, a high-ranking member of an L.A. Ukrainian mob family and the cousin of Yevhen. He uses Yevhen's store as a laundering front and also has a front on a local junkyard, and he is also against Steve for murdering Yevhen.  Production  = Development = Neal Purvis and Robert Wade wrote a draft of a remake of the 1969 British crime comedy The Italian Job which was rejected by Paramount. Screenwriting team Donna and Wayne Powers were subsequently commissioned to write a remake. The duo viewed the original film, which neither had seen before, only once \\"because [they] wanted to get a sense of what it was about\\" in regards to its tone. Over the course of two years and through 18 drafts, they developed a screenplay which was described by director F. Gary Gray as \\"inspired by the original.\\" Gray, Powers and Powers, and executive producer James Dyer identified the most prominent similarities as the trio of Mini Coopers used by the thieves, as well as the titular heist involving the theft of gold bullion. Some sequences of the film were storyboarded and previsualized by Gray before production began. = Casting = Gray had been interested in working with Wahlberg since seeing his performance in Boogie Nights (1997). After reading the script for The Italian Job, Gray contacted Wahlberg, who \\"fell in love with it\\" after reading it himself. Green was also attracted to the project because of the script. Theron was Gray's first choice for the character of Stella Bridger, and Wahlberg also recommended her for the role. She spent time with a safecracker in preparation for the role. Gray's casting director Sheila Jaffe suggested Statham for the role of getaway driver Handsome Rob, and Gray agreed with her choice. Norton took the role of Steve Frazelli, due to a contractual obligation he had to fulfill.https://observer.com/2002/09/ed-norton-to-lansing-burn-this/amp/ Wahlberg, Theron, and Statham attended special driver's training sessions at Willow Springs International Motorsports Park for nearly a month during pre- production. = Filming = Gray and cinematographer Wally Pfister worked together to develop a visual style for the film before production began. They viewed car commercials and magazine photographs, as well as chase sequences from The French Connection (1971), Ronin (1998), and The Bourne Identity (2002) as visual references. Pfister wanted \\"dark textures and undertones and strong contrast\\"; he collaborated with production designer Charlie Wood on the color palette, and the two would confer with Gray on their ideas. Paramount preferred that The Italian Job not be shot in the anamorphic format, despite Pfister's wishes to do so. Gray wanted a widescreen aspect ratio, so they chose to shoot the film in Super 35 for a 2.4:1 aspect ratio. Once principal photography began, Gray frequently utilized dollies, as well as Steadicams and a Technocrane, to keep the cameras almost constantly moving. Most of The Italian Job was shot on location, at sites Pfister scouted over 12 weeks during pre-production, but some scenes were filmed on sets. The Venice building where the film's opening heist sequence takes place, the van from which the thieves survey Steve Frazelli's mansion, a hotel room, and the LACMTA Red Line subway tunnel were sets constructed at Downey Studios in California. For the scene in which an armored truck falls through Hollywood Boulevard and into the subway tunnel below, Pfister set up seven cameras to capture the vehicle's ~ descent. Three hundred cars were used to simulate the traffic jam at the intersection of Hollywood and Highland, which was controlled by the production crew for a week. Three of the 32 custom-built Mini Coopers used during principal photography were fitted with electric motors since combustion engines were not allowed in the subway tunnels, where some scenes were shot. Other Mini Coopers were modified to allow for camera placement on and inside the vehicles. The director remarked that \\"[the Mini Coopers are] part of the cast.\\" Gray wanted the film to be as realistic as possible; accordingly, the actors did most of their own stunts, and computer- generated imagery was used very sparingly. The second unit, under director Alexander Witt and cinematographer Josh Bleibtreu, filmed establishing shots, the Venice canal chase sequence, and the Los Angeles chase sequence over a period of 40 days. Filming on location posed some challenges. The opening heist sequence in Venice, Italy, was strictly monitored by the local authorities, due to the high speeds the boats were driven at. The frigid temperatures at Passo Fedaia in the Italian Alps created problems during production: \\"The guns would jam, and if you could imagine not being able to walk 40 feet with a bottle of water without it freezing, those are the conditions we had to work in,\\" Gray remarked. Pedestrians had to be allowed to use the sidewalks of Hollywood Boulevard between takes. Also, scenes which took place on freeways and city streets were only filmed on weekends.  Release  = Box-office performance = The Italian Job premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on May 11, 2003, and was theatrically released in the United States on May 30, 2003. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $19,457,944, ranking at #3. Paramount re-released the film on August 29, and by the time its theatrical release closed in November 2003, the film had grossed $106,128,601 in the United States and Canada and $69,941,570 overseas‚Äî$176,070,171 worldwide. It was the highest-grossing film produced by Paramount in 2003. = Critical response = Based on 183 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, The Italian Job has an overall approval rating of 73%, with a weighted average score of 6.43/10. The site's consensus reads, \\"Despite some iffy plot elements, The Italian Job succeeds in delivering an entertaining modern take on the original 1969 heist film, thanks to a charismatic cast.\\" Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews from mainstream critics, calculated an average score of 68 out of 100 from the 37 reviews it collected, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews.\\" Stephanie Zacharek, writing for Salon.com, liked the reinvention of the plot and the style and execution of the action sequences, specifically those involving the trio of Mini Coopers, which she wrote were the stars of the film. BBC reviewer Stella Papamichael gave The Italian Job 4 stars out of 5, and wrote that the \\"revenge plot adds wallop lacking in the original\\". Los Angeles Times reviewer Kevin Thomas praised the opening Venice heist sequence and the characterization of each of the thieves, but felt that the Los Angeles heist sequence was \\"arguably stretched out a little too long\\". Roger Ebert gave the film 3 stars out of 4, writing that the film was \\"two hours of mindless escapism on a relatively skilled professional level.\\" Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle concurred, describing The Italian Job as pure but smart entertainment \\"plotted and executed with invention and humor\\". Reviewer James Berardinelli also gave the film 3 stars out of 4, and said that Gray had discovered the right recipe to do a heist movie: \\"keep things moving, develop a nice rapport between the leads, toss in the occasional surprise, and top with a sprinkling of panache.\\" Varietys Robert Koehler compared The Italian Job to The Score (2001), another \\"finely tuned heist pic\\" which also featured Edward Norton in a similar role. David Denby, writing for The New Yorker, praised Norton's performance, as well as those of Seth Green and Mos Def, and the lack of digital effects in the action sequences. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B‚àí grade, comparing it positively to the 2000 remake of Gone in 60 Seconds, as well as the 2001 remake of Ocean's Eleven. New York Daily News reviewer Jack Mathews gave The Italian Job 2.5 stars out of 4, writing that the action sequences and plot twists were a \\"vast improvement\\" from the original, and that the Los Angeles heist sequence was \\"clever and preposterous\\". Mike Clark of USA Today also questioned the probability of the Los Angeles heist sequence and wrote that the film was \\"a lazy and in-name-only remake\\", giving it 2 stars out of 4. Peter Travers, writing for Rolling Stone, gave The Italian Job 1 star out of 4, describing the film as \\"a tricked-out remake of a heist flick that was already flat and formulaic in 1969.\\" Travers enjoyed the comic relief in Green's and Def's characters, and added that Norton's was \\"[t]he most perversely magnetic performance\\" outside of the Mini Coopers, but felt that there was a lack of logic in the film. = Home media = The Italian Job was released on DVD by Paramount Home Entertainment October 7, 2003, and includes five bonus features on different aspects of the film's production, in addition to six deleted scenes. It was released on HD DVD August 8, 2006 and on Blu-ray Disc October 24, 2006. = Accolades = F. Gary Gray won a Film Life Movie Award for Best Director at the 2004 American Black Film Festival. Clay Cullen, Michael Caines, Jean Paul Ruggiero and Mike Massa won an award for Best Specialty Stunt at the 2004 Taurus World Stunt Awards for the boat chase through the canals of Venice. The Italian Job was nominated for the 2003 Saturn Award for Best Action/Adventure/Thriller Film, but lost to Kill Bill. In April 2009, IGN named the film's Los Angeles chase sequence one of the top 10 car chases of the 21st Century. = Analysis = Criminologist Nicole Rafter saw The Italian Job as part of a revival of the heist film around the start of the 21st century, along with The Thomas Crown Affair (1999) and Ocean's Eleven (2001), both of which were also remakes of 1960s heist films. In describing his theory of a \\"team film\\" genre, film scholar Dr. Jeremy Strong writes that The Italian Job could be categorized as such, along with The Magnificent Seven (1960), The Great Escape (1963), The Dirty Dozen (1967), and more recently The Usual Suspects (1995) and Mission: Impossible (1996). He states that > a team film involves a group working towards a particular objective. > However, goal-orientation is a widely shared plot attribute of many texts > and genres and it is also the case that the overwhelming majority of films > involve a plurality of interacting characters. An element that distinguishes > the team film then is that a heightened significance is afforded to the > group as the means by which a given objective is attempted. [...] From film > to film there is variation in the extent to which particular central > characters may determine events and take up screen time but team films are > recognizable by their insistence upon the relationship between group and > goal. Strong additionally makes a direct comparison between The Italian Job and Mission: Impossible, citing the plot device of \\"a first task that elucidates the roles and skills of team members but which is sabotaged by betrayal, necessitating a re-constitution of the team.\\" The use of BMW's then-new line of retro-styled Minis in the film was mentioned by critics and business analysts alike as a prime example of modern product placement, or more specifically \\"brand integration\\". Film critic Joe Morgenstern called The Italian Job \\"the best car commercial ever\\". Zacharek and Mathews both noted the cars' prominence in their reviews of the film, also writing that their presence served as a connection to the 1969 film upon which it was based. BusinessWeek reported in April 2004 that sales of the Mini in 2003‚Äîthe year in which The Italian Job was theatrically released‚Äîhad increased 22 percent over the previous year.  Possible sequel  A sequel to The Italian Job, tentatively titled The Brazilian Job, was in development by the summer of 2004, but has since faced multiple delays. Principal photography was initially slated to begin in March 2005, with a projected release date in November or December 2005.

Writer David Twohy approached Paramount Pictures with an original screenplay entitled The Wrecking Crew, and though the studio reportedly liked the idea, they thought it would work better as a sequel to The Italian Job. Gray was slated to return as director, as well as most, if not all, of the original cast. At least two drafts of the script had been written by August 2007, but the project had not been greenlit. In March 2008, in an interview, Jason Statham said that \\"somebody should just erase it from IMDb.... and put it back on there when it's fully due and ready. [...] It's one of those things that's just sitting around.\\" Producer Donald De Line revealed in June that a script for The Brazilian Job had been developed and budgeted, but \\"a lot of things were happening with various management changes and it got tabled.\\" Describing its story, he said it \\"starts in Brazil, the set up is in Rio and the picture moves to Belgium where there‚Äôs something involving diamonds.\\" However, Green stated that September that the sequel was unlikely in the near future. On March 9, 2009, De Line said that \\"[we] have a version at Paramount that we're talking very serious about\\", additionally mentioning that the cast was interested in the project. Neal Purvis and Robert Wade had been working on a draft of the sequel that year. The Daily Record reported in September that Theron was signed up for the film. That October, Gray said that he enjoyed making The Italian Job and hoped that he would still be interested in directing the sequel if the script became finalized and mentioned that it would be dependent upon scheduling. In January 2010, Twohy was quoted in an interview as saying \\"The Brazilian Job probably isn't happening. I wrote it years ago, and they just keep rolling it over on IMDb. Paramount‚Äîwhat can I say?\\" When asked about the sequel that June, Green said \\"The Brazilian Job doesn't exist actually\\" and called it a \\"wonderful myth of IMDb.\\" However, the next month, Mark Wahlberg said that sequel production was \\"active\\" again.

Cabranes's refusal to accept appointment as Ambassador to Colombia, after the Colombian government's initial hesitation to accept a Puerto Rican as the American envoy, led to a political firestorm and charges by national Hispanic leaders of the White House's mismanagement of an appointment they had supported. Cabranes was nominated by President Jimmy Carter on November 6, 1979, to a seat on the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut vacated by Judge Jon O. Newman. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on December 5, 1979, and received commission on December 10, 1979. He served as chief judge, from 1992 to 1994.

His nomination was confirmed unanimously by the U.S. Senate on August 9, 1994. Cabranes thus became the second Puerto Rican named to a U.S. Court of Appeals, after Juan R. Torruella who had been appointed by Ronald Reagan in 1984 to the First Circuit. Cabranes also became the first Hispanic judge to serve on the Second Circuit.

Some people suggested that Bush nominate him to the Supreme Court. https://www.nysun.com/national/2nd-circuits-jose-cabranes-offers- bipartisan/15208/ Notable rulings The following decisions, among others, appear in the 2010 edition of the Almanac of the Federal Judiciary.Almanac of the Federal Judiciary, Vol. II (Aspen 2010). United States v. Gatlin, 216 F.3d 207 (2d Cir. 2000): Cabranes, writing for the panel in a matter of first appellate impression, held that the district court was without congressionally authorized jurisdiction to try a civilian charged with committing a crime against an individual on a United States military installation abroad. Cabranes concluded that such crimes fell within a \\"jurisdictional gap\\" that was created 40 years ago when the Supreme Court ruled that civilians may not be tried in courts martial, and directed that a copy of the opinion be forwarded to members of Congress for their consideration. Following the panel's decision, Congress enacted a statute remedying the jurisdictional gap. In re United States (Coppa), 267 F.3d 132 (2d Cir. 2001): Cabranes, writing for the panel and granting the government's petition for mandamus, held that the district court misapplied the teachings of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963) and its progeny in holding that the government was required, as a matter of constitutional law, to disclose all impeachment evidence immediately, pursuant to defendants' request for such, without regard to its materiality and far in advance of trial. United States v. Thomas, 274 F.3d 655 (2d Cir. 2001) (en banc): Cabranes, writing for the unanimous en banc court, held that the teachings of the Supreme Court's decision in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000) compel the conclusion that drug type and quantity are elements of the offense under 21 U.S.C. ¬ß841 that must be charged in the indictment and submitted to the jury for its finding beyond a reasonable doubt. United States v. Reyes, 283 F.3d 446 (2d Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 833 (2002): Cabranes, writing for the panel, provided an account of the United States Probation Office functions and held that a probation officer conducting a court-imposed home visit of a convicted person serving a term of federal supervised release is not subject to the probable cause requirements of the Fourth Amendment or to the reasonable suspicion standard applicable to probation searches under United States v. Knight, 534 U.S. 112 (2001). Cabranes also concluded that, contrary to the so-called \\"stalking horse\\" theory, the law permits cooperation between probation officers and law enforcement personnel. United States v. Quinones, 313 F.3d 49 (2d Cir. 2002), reh 'g denied 317 F. 3d 86 (2d Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1051 (2003): Cabranes, writing for the panel, held that the district court erred by finding the Federal Death Penalty Act of 1994 unconstitutional. Cabranes held that, to the extent that the challenge against the statute relied upon the Eighth Amendment, it was foreclosed by the Supreme Court's decision in Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153 (1976). With respect to the Due Process Clause, Cabranes held that it protected against government infringement upon rights that were so rooted in the traditions and conscience of the people as to be ranked as fundamental, but that the claim that there was a fundamental right to a continued opportunity for exoneration throughout the course of one's natural life was not (as the district court had suggested) a novel issue, and indeed, was foreclosed by relevant Supreme Court precedents. United States v. Yousef, 327 F.3d 56 (2d Cir. 2003), cert. denied 540 U.S. 933 (2003): Cabranes, writing jointly with other members of the panel, held that the district court erroneously concluded that the acts charged in one of the counts against the defendant were offenses against the law of nations that supported the exercise of universal jurisdiction. Cabranes concluded that customary international law currently does not provide for the prosecution of \\"terrorist\\" acts under the universality principle, in part due to the failure of States to achieve anything like consensus on the definition of terrorism. Cabranes nonetheless held that prosecution and conviction of the defendant on the count in question was both consistent with and required by the United States' treaty obligations and domestic laws. Flores v. Southern Peru Copper Corporation, 343 F.3d 140 (2d Cir. 2003): Cabranes, writing for the panel, held that customary international law, for the violation of which an alien has a private right of action under Alien Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1350, is limited to those clear and unambiguous rules by which states universally abide, or to which they accede, out of a sense of legal obligation and mutual concern. Cabranes concluded that the rights to life and health are insufficiently definite to constitute rules of customary international law and that plaintiffs, who alleged that Peruvian operations of an American mining company had caused severe lung disease, have not submitted evidence sufficient to establish that customary international law prohibits intranational pollution. Church of the American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan v. Kerik, 356 F.3d 197 (2d Cir. 2004), cert. denied 125 S. Ct. 655 (2004): Cabranes, writing for the panel, upheld New York's anti-mask statute against constitutional challenge, holding that masks worn by self-described members of an \\"unincorporated political membership association that advocates on behalf of the white race and the Christian faith\\" did not constitute expressive conduct entitled to First Amendment protection. Cabranes concluded that where a statute banning conduct imposes a burden on the wearing of an element of an expressive uniform, which element has no independent or incremental expressive value, the first amendment is not implicated. Jeffreys v. City of New York, 426 F.3d 549 (2d Cir. 2005): Cabranes, writing for the panel, affirmed a district court's dismissal of a suit alleging excessive force on the part of New York police officers. Cabranes held that, notwithstanding the general rule that district courts may not weigh evidence or assess the credibility of witnesses at the summary judgment stage, a district court may grant summary judgment where a plaintiff relies almost exclusively on his own testimony and that testimony is \\"so replete with inconsistencies and improbabilities\\" that no reasonable juror would undertake the suspension of disbelief necessary to credit he allegations made in the complaint. Hayden v. Pataki, 449 F.3d 305 (2d Cir. 2006) (en banc): Cabranes, writing for a majority of the en banc court, held that section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 1973, did not extend to a New York statute that disenfranchised currently incarcerated felons and parolees, N.Y. Elec. Law ¬ß5-106. Cabranes held that Congress did not intend to include prisoner disenfranchisement provisions of the type adopted by New York within the coverage of section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, and that Congress made no clear statement of an intent to modify the federal balance by applying the Voting Rights Act to these provisions. Iqbal v. Hasty, 490 F.3d 143 (2d Cir. 2007): In a concurring opinion, Cabranes urged the Supreme Court to revisit and clarify its precedents on pleading standards in order to determine whether they strike the right balance between the need to deter unlawful conduct and the dangers of exposing public officials to burdensome litigation. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to consider the adequacy of the pleadings in this case. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 128 S.Ct. 2931 (2008). Mora v. New York, 524 F.3d 183 (2d Cir. 2008): Cabranes, writing for a unanimous panel on a question of first impression, held that the requirement of Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations that a detained alien be informed of the availability of consular notification and access did not establish a right that could be vindicated in a civil rights action for damages. He also concluded that the detention of an alien without being informed of the availability of consular notification and access did not amount to a tort in violation of customary international law cognizable under the Alien Tort Statute. Ricci v. DeStefano, 530 F.3d 88 (2d Cir 2008): In a dissenting opinion joined by five other members of the 13-member court, Cabranes objected to the perfunctory affirmance of an award of summary judgment to the defendants in a civil rights action. Cabranes dissented from the denial of en banc rehearing of this case, observing that the appeal raised important questions of first impression regarding the application of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause and Title VII's prohibition on discriminatory employment practices-primarily, whether a city employer may disregard the results of a qualifying employment examination, which was carefully constructed to ensure race-neutrality, on the ground that the results of that examination yielded too many qualified applicants of one race and not enough of another. Cabranes urged the Supreme Court to consider the question, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari on January 9, 2009. The Supreme Court reviewed the decision to dismiss the suit, reversed it, and took the unusual step of granting judgment for the firefighters. Arar v. Ashcroft, 532 F.3d 157 (2d Cir. 2008): In an action brought by a dual citizen of Canada and Syria arising from his alleged detention in the United States, transfer to Syria, and detention and torture in Syria, Cabranes, writing for a unanimous panel, held that the court had jurisdiction over the defendant government officials and that the plaintiff had failed to state a claim under the Torture Victim Prevention Act. Writing for the panel majority, Cabranes affirmed the dismissal of the plaintiff's claims brought under Bivens v. Six Unknown Federal Narcotics Agents, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), on the grounds that (1) an alternative remedial scheme precluded recognition of the claims, and (2) special factors counseled hesitation in creating a new and freestanding Bivens remedy. In re Terrorist Bombings (Fourth Amendment Challenges), 552 F.3d 157 (2d Cir. 2008): Affirming the convictions of Al Qaeda terrorists for their involvement in the bombing of the American Embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, Cabranes held, as a matter of first impression, that the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement does not govern searches of U.S. citizens conducted abroad by U.S. agents; such searches need only satisfy the Fourth Amendment's requirement of reasonableness. Cabranes also held that a district court's ex parte, in camera evaluation of evidence submitted by the government in opposition to a suppression motion is appropriate when national security considerations weigh in favor of maintaining the confidentiality of that evidence. In re Terrorist Bombings (Fifth Amendment Challenges) 552 F.3d 177 (2d Cir. 2008): Considering the motions to suppress statements made overseas to U.S. and non-U.S. officials by defendants convicted of participation in the bombing of American Embassies in East Africa, Cabranes held that oral warnings provided by a federal prosecutor were sufficient to apprise the defendants of their Miranda rights insofar as they had any such rights. In addition, Cabranes held that defendants' 14-day incommunicado detention in Kenyan custody did not render their post-warning statements involuntary and that, in order to reopen suppression proceedings, the government is not required to offer a reasonable justification for not having presented evidence at an earlier proceeding. SEC v. Dorozhko, 574 F.3d 42 (2d Cir. 2009): Writing for a unanimous panel, Cabranes held that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission could sue a computer hacker under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 even though the defendant was neither a fiduciary nor corporate insider, so long as the theory of fraud was an affirmative misrepresentation in connection with the purchase or sale of a security, rather than the violation of a duty to disclose the basis for a trade. In re N.Y. Times Co., 577 F.3d 401 (2d Cir. 2009): Cabranes, writing for a unanimous panel, held that neither the First Amendment nor the common law right of access entitled the New York Times and other media companies to review wiretap applications that were sealed pursuant to a federal statute, where the media companies had not met the statutory threshold of \\"good cause.\\" The wiretap applications were submitted and approved as part of a federal investigation of the \\"Emperor's Club,\\" a prostitution ring linked to the former Governor of New York, Elliot Spitzer. Henry v. Ricks, 578 F.3d 134 (2d Cir. 2009): Writing for a unanimous panel, Cabranes held that a ruling of the New York Court of Appeals that affected the elements of depraved indifference murder under New York law did not apply retroactively in a state prisoner's habeas petition. Notably, Cabranes held that the Due Process Clause did not require the retroactive application of a change in state criminal law. United States v. Ray, 578 F.3d 184 (2d Cir. 2009): Considering a speedy-trial challenge to a sentence imposed 15 years after conviction, Cabranes, writing for a unanimous panel, held that the Speedy Trial Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution applies to trials only, not to sentencing proceedings. Although the Sixth Amendment was inapplicable to the appellant's sentencing, Cabranes held that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment did apply to sentencing proceedings. Because the 15-year delay in sentencing was not justified by any legitimate reason and was prejudicial, the sentence violated the Due Process Clause. United States v. Rigas, 583 F.3d 108 (2d Cir. 2009): Writing for a unanimous panel, Cabranes upheld the sentences imposed on John J. Rigas and Timothy J. Rigas, the former CEO and CFO of Adelphia Communications Corp, which was among the largest U.S. cable companies before its collapse in an accounting scandal. Cabranes rejected arguments that the sentences were \\"substantively unreasonable,\\" and described that standard as akin to a \\"manifest-injustice\\" or a \\"shocks-the-conscience\\" standard. In other words, wrote Cabranes, appellate review of the substance of a sentence \\"provide[s] a backstop for those few cases that, although procedurally correct, would nonetheless damage the administration of justice because the sentence imposed was shockingly high, shockingly low, or otherwise unsupportable as a matter of law.\\" Selevan v. New York Thruway Authority, 584 F.3d 82 (2d Cir. 2009): Cabranes, writing for a unanimous panel, held that plaintiffs, who challenged an interstate highway toll policy that afforded a discount to citizens of Grand Island, New York stated claims under several provisions of the Constitution, including the dormant Commerce Clause, the Equal Protection Clause, and the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Cabranes rejected the New York Thruway Authority's argument that its action was not subject to scrutiny under the dormant Commerce Clause because it was a \\"market participant,\\" and the opinion established that dormant Commerce Clause challenges to highway toll policies must be analyzed under the factors set forth in the Supreme Court's opinion in Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. County of Kent, 510 U.S. 355, 369 (1994). Cabranes also held that one of the plaintiffs, who was a United States citizen residing in Canada, could not state a claim under the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV, which, he explained, was designed to integrate the several states into coherent whole and did not afford protection to residents of foreign countries. Law reform work Cabranes was elected to the American Law Institute in 1980 and became a Life Member of the Institute in 2005.

After graduation, Mrs. Cabranes worked as a grammar school teacher, and for a period during the Second World War, as director of the San Juan school lunch program. In 1946, she moved with her family to the South Bronx, where her husband had been recruited by the National Council of Jewish Women to become the executive director of Melrose House, a settlement house that had historically served Jewish immigrants, but was then principally serving its neighborhood's recently arrived Puerto Rican population. Mrs. Cabranes became an editor of Spanish-language publications for McGraw-Hill, and was the production editor of the journals of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. While living in New York City in the 1950s and 1960s, Carmen Cabranes was involved in politics, participating in John F. Kennedy's 1960 presidential campaign and Robert F. Kennedy's 1964 senatorial campaign. She worked closed at her husband's side in the cultural, civic and religious leadership of the Puerto Rican community in New York. The couple retired to Santurce, Puerto Rico, in 1965, where Mrs. Cabranes was briefly the editor of the industrial guide of the Puerto Rico Economic Development Administration. She was active in pro- statehood politics, participating exuberantly in mass rallies well into her 90s. She died in San Juan in 2006 at the age of 96. Jos√© A. Cabranes's father, Manuel Cabranes, was born in Toa Alta, PR, a rural town in the hills of the island's north-central region, and began his career as a rural school teacher in the countryside around Toa Alta. In time he became a teacher in the island's capital city and principal of the Rafael M. de Labra School in Santurce, PR. In 1931, he and two other Puerto Rican teachers were selected for graduate training fellowships in the continental United States in the newly-developing professional field of social work, thereby becoming the first professionally trained social workers in Puerto Rico. Returning from graduate work at Fordham University in 1933, Manuel Cabranes served as a supervisor of social work in several of the reconstruction programs of the territorial government of the New Deal era (1934‚Äì1940), organizing and directing the territory's first program of probation and parole (1934‚Äì1936) and later, in Mayaguez, serving as director of the Escuela Industrial Para Ni√±os (Industrial School for Boys), one of the first \\"reform schools\\" on the island (1940‚Äì1942). Manuel Cabranes was a founder of the probation and parole office of the island's federal court, serving from 1942 to 1946 as Chief Probation Officer of the U.S. District Court in Puerto Rico. He was serving in the federal court of Puerto Rico when he was recruited to become director of Melrose House in the South Bronx, part of the first airborne migration to New York City in the post-war era. Jos√© Cabranes and an older brother, Manuel A., studied at St. Anslem's School in the South Bronx, and later, in the public schools of Flushing, Queens. Manuel Cabranes in 1948 was appointed the first director of the office of the government of Puerto Rico in New York City by Gov. Jes√∫s T. Pi√±ero, and also served for several years under the island's first elected governor, Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n.\\"Pinero Cites Gains by Puerto Ricans,\\" N.Y.

Hosted by the Yothu Yindi Foundation, Garma is a celebration of the cultural traditions of the Yolngu people, and a major community gathering for the clans and families of the Arnhem Land region. The event showcases traditional miny'tji (art), ancient story-telling, manikay (song), and bunggul (dance). It is held at Gulkula, a significant Gumatj ceremonial site about from the township of Nhulunbuy, attracts more than 2500 guests each year and is often sold out months in advance. In recent years, Garma has become an important fixture on the political calendar, attracting business, political, academic, and philanthropic leaders to help shape Indigenous affairs policy through the Key Forum conference. History The first Garma was held in 1999 and was little more than a backyard barbecue. Dhapanbal Yunupingu, the daughter of Dr M Yunupingu, said the first event was a small-scale affair. ‚ÄúI remember when Galarrwuy and dad brought us here, and they were standing on the Bunggul ground, and they said: This is the Garma site, this is where the festival is going to be.‚Äô We were only little. Dad picked his camp. My uncles picked their camp. There were five white fellas who came. There were no tents, two cars, and a BBQ. Our chef slept next to the back of the ute in a swag‚Äù. Garma has three main aims: * To provide contemporary environments and programs for the practice, preservation, maintenance and presentation of traditional knowledge systems and cultural traditions and practices, especially bunggul (traditional dance), Manikay (song), Miny' tji (art) and ceremony. * To share knowledge and culture, thereby fostering greater understanding between Indigenous and non- Indigenous Australians. * To develop economic opportunities for Yolngu through education, training, employment, enterprise and remote Indigenous community development. The word garma is a Yolngu word meaning \\"two-way learning process\\". =2017= At Garma 2017, the Gumatj Corporation entered into several historic agreements with the federal government and other parties. These included plans for the Gulkula Regional Training Centre, a township lease agreement for Gunyangara, and an agreement with Rio Tinto Alcan on bauxite sales for the Gulkula Mine project. This would be the first Indigenous-owned and -operated mining venture on traditional owner land. In addition, the Corporation discussed the potential hosting of a rocket launch site (see below).  The Gulkula site  Garma is held at Gulkula, a significant Gumatj ceremonial site in northeast Arnhem Land, in a stringy-bark forest atop an escarpment overlooking the Gulf of Carpentaria. The trees on the escarpment at Gulkula are mainly of one species of stringybark known as Eucalyptus tetradonta. In Yolngu culture the grey stringy-barks have many names, and one Dhuwa moiety name is \\"Gadayka\\". In August, Gadayka is in flower and small native bees turn nectar into honey. Gulkula is connected with the actions of a Yolngu ancestor, Ganbulapula. In his search for honey, Ganbulapula used his walking stick to hit the trees and so disturb the bees. With his hand shielding his eyes from the sun as he looked up, Ganbulapula could see the tiny black bees hovering around their hive in the hollow of a tree; he looked upwards to trace the flight of bees. A link is established through honey and the actions of both the Yirritja and Dhuwa moiety ancestors, with people and land and sea-country across northeast Arnhem Land. The significance of bees and honey is manifested in sacred designs that identify the body of cultural knowledge associated with honey. =Rocket tracking site= In 1964, many of the trees on the escarpment at Gulkula were bulldozed and then burnt by the Department of Works so the Gove Down Range Guidance and Telemetry Station could be built. At the time, the Yolngu owners had no rights in Australian law, and they were powerless to prevent the European Launcher Development Organisation from installing a rocket tracking station on the ceremonial site. The purpose of the station was to track the path of rockets launched from Woomera in South Australia, and its state-of-the-art technology was operated by mainly Belgian scientists. In September 2020, the original twenty-tonne satellite tracker, which had been stored at Woomera for decades, was returned to the Gove Peninsula, to be restored and put on display at the Gove Airport headquarters of the Arnhemland Historical Society. =Rocket launch site= In 2017, thanks to the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976, the Yolngu landowners were consulted on the possible construction of a new space facility. In 2017, the Gumatj clan, through the Northern Land Council, approved a lease to the Gumatj Corporation for the purposes of operating a sub-orbital rocket launch pad, a first not just for Yolngu but for Australia. The proposed site covers , and had by 2019 been sub-leased to Equatorial Launch Australia (ELA) by the Gumatj people. ELA will hire out Gulkula Launch Site to aeronautical organisations such as NASA. In May 2019, NASA announced its intention to sign a contract with ELA, and launch four rockets in 2020. The site is seen by NASA as a move from its previous preferred site for rocket launches in Australia at Woomera, which it has not used since 1995. The proximity of a deep-water port is seen as an advantage, reducing the cost of transporting rockets and payloads, compared with road transport across the desert. In July 2019, scientists from NASA visited the site, funded by the Northern Territory Government and ELA. The facility is seen as a huge opportunity to boost the economy of the region, providing jobs and pathways for STEM graduates.  Features  = Bunggul = One of Garma‚Äôs main highlights is the nightly bunggul - traditional ceremonial dances performed each day from 4:00pm until sunset. In these highly significant ceremonies, men, women and children from the 13 Yolngu clan groups perform a dance unique to northeast Arnhem Land. During these performances, the senior holders of the Yolngu songlines share with guests their stories of manikay (song), accompanied by the call of the yidaki (didgeridoo) and the rhythm of the bilma (clapsticks). In 2014, The Monthly‚Äôs \\"Best of Australian Arts\\" edition described the bunggul as \\"an exhilarating performance\\" and \\"an example of one of the world‚Äôs oldest musical traditions. We must do everything to recognise its enormous value to our lives as Australians\\". = Key Forum = Held over three days, the Garma Key Forum has become an important platform for the discussion and debate of Indigenous issues and policy, attracting political, business, academic, and philanthropic leaders from Australia and overseas. It is an important political event for this reason. Although the conference agenda changes from year to year to reflect the Garma theme, topics such as Indigenous land rights, Indigenous health, education, economic development and government funding are regularly part of the program. = Gapan Gallery = Set in a grove of stringy-bark trees adjacent to the bunggul grounds, the open-air Gapan Gallery features limited edition artworks from a range of local and regional arts centres. Arts centres featured at recent Garma events include Buku-Larrnggay, Bula‚Äôbula Arts, Elcho Island Arts and Ngukkur Arts Centre. = Cultural Workshops = Senior Yolngu men and women provide a series of cultural workshops which provide guests with an immersive experience in an authentic bush setting.

It is one of the capital cities of the Province of Barletta-Andria-Trani.  History  =Overview= The city of Turenum appears for the first time in the Tabula Peutingeriana, a 13th-century copy of an ancient Roman itinerary. The name, also spelled Tirenum, was that of the Greek hero Diomedes. The city was later occupied by the Lombards and the Byzantines. First certain news of an urban settlement in Trani, however, trace back only to the 9th century. The most flourishing age of Trani was the 11th century, when it became an episcopal see in place of Canosa, destroyed by the Saracens. Its port, well placed for the Crusades, then developed greatly, becoming the most important on the Adriatic Sea. In the year 1063 Trani issued the Ordinamenta et consuetudo maris, which is \\"the oldest surviving maritime law code of the Latin West\\".Paul Oldfield, City and Community in Norman Italy (Oxford: 2009), 247. There was also Jewish community in Trani, which was under the protection of the king until it was given to the Archbishop Samarus during the reign of Henry VI at the end of the 12th century. In that period many great families from the main Italian Maritime Republics (Amalfi, Pisa, Genova and Venice) established themselves in Trani. Trani, in turn, maintained a consul in Venice from 12th century. The presence of other consulates in many northern Europe centres, even in England and Netherlands, shows Trani's trading and political importance in the Middle Ages. Emperor Frederick II built a massive castle in Trani. Under his rule, in the early 13th century, the city reached its highest point of wealth and prosperity. There was some economic progress during the nineteenth century, and by 1881 the population had reached 25,647. Trani at this time was an important trading point for wines, fruits and grain.The Century Cyclopaedia of Names, coordinated by Benjamin E Smith and published by the De Vinne Press, New York 1894 (Page 1005) =Jewish history= Scolanova Synagogue. Benjamin of Tudela visited Trani in around 1159, following this visit he found 200 Jewish families living there. By the 12th century, Trani already housed one of the largest Jewish communities of Southern Italy, and was the birthplace of one of the greatest medieval rabbis of Italy: Rabbi Isaiah ben Mali di Trani (c. 1180-1250), a prolific and prominent commentator and halakhic authority. The great talmudist Rabbi Moses ben Joseph di Trani (1505‚Äì1585) was born in Thessaloniki, three years after his family had fled there from Trani due to antisemitic persecution. Trani entered a crisis under the Anjou and Aragonese rule (14th‚Äì16th centuries), as its Jewish component was persecuted under Dominican pressure.Joshua Starr, \\"The Mass Conversion of Jews in Southern Italy (1290‚Äì1293)\\" Speculum 21.2 (April 1946), pp. 203-211, Under the House of Bourbon, however, Trani recovered a certain splendour, thanks to the generally improved condition of Southern Italy economy and the construction of several magnificent buildings. Trani was province capital until the Napoleonic age, when Joachim Murat deprived it of this status in favour of Bari. In 1799, moreover, the French troops provoked a massacre of Trani's population, as it had adhered to the Neapolitan Republic. The Scolanova Synagogue survives and, after many centuries as a church, has been rededicated as a synagogue.Jerusalem Post, 24 August 2006, Jewish again in Trani, By Ari Z. Zivotofsky and Ari Greenspan The church of Sant'Anna is another medieval former synagogue. Geography Located by the Adriatic Coast, between Barletta and Bisceglie, Trani borders with the municipalities of Andria, Barletta, Bisceglie and Corato, in the Province of Bari. Main sights The cathedral The old fort Trani has lost its old city walls and bastions, but the 13th-century fort has been extensively restored as a museum and performance venue and is open to the public. Some of the streets in and around the Ghetto area remain much as they were in the medieval period, and many of the houses display more or less of Norman decoration. The main church is the Trani Cathedral, dedicated to Saint Nicholas the Pilgrim, a Greek who died in Trani in 1094 while on his way on pilgrimage to Rome, and some years later canonized by Urban II. It lies on a raised open site near the sea, and was consecrated, before its completion, in 1143. It is a basilica with three apses, built in the characteristic white local limestone. It has also a large crypt and a lofty tower, the latter erected in 1230‚Äì1239 by the architect whose name appears on the ambo in the cathedral of Bitonto, Nicolaus Sacerdos. It has an arch under it, being supported partly on the side wall of the church, and partly on a massive pillar. The arches of the Romanesque portal are beautifully ornamented, in a manner suggestive of Arab influence; the bronze doors, executed by Barisanus of Trani in 1175, rank among the best of their period in Southern Italy.Comparable doors by Barisanus are at Ravello and Monreale. David A. Walsh, \\"The Iconography of the Bronze Doors of Barisanus of Trani\\" Gesta 21.2 (1982:91-106). The capitals of the pillars in the crypt are fine examples of the Romanesque. The interior of the cathedral has been widely modernized, but the crypt remains similar to the origins and was renowned repository of relics, among which indicates the body of the martyr St. Febronia of Nisibis that you can still Today enjoy a precious reliquary of the eighteenth century and an oval painting depicting the Saint at the Diocesan Museum. Near the harbor is the Gothic Palace of the Doges of Venice, which is now used as a seminary. The Church of Ognissanti which at one stage was the chapel of a Knights Templar hospital has a Romanesque relief of the Annunciation over the door. San Giacomo and San Francesco also have Romanesque fa√ßades; the latter, together with Sant'Andrea, have Byzantine domes.  Government   Economy  The territory of Trani produces an excellent wine, Moscato di Trani; and its figs, olive oil, almonds and grain are also profitable articles of trade.

He has released three solo albums, as well as three collaborative albums with Panda Bear (Noah Lennox) which were later retroactively classified under Animal Collective's discography. Animal Collective With Animal Collective, 2013 Portner met Animal Collective's Deakin (Josh Dibb), Panda Bear (Noah Lennox), and Geologist (Brian Weitz) in high school. For years, the four of them swapped homemade recordings, shared musical ideas and performed in different group configurations. Portner recorded the Spirit They're Gone, Spirit They've Vanished album with Lennox, and initially released the recording on the band's own Animal label in 1999. The album is commonly referred to as the first official Animal Collective release, with Tare writing the music and Lennox providing the 'perfect percussion' (as cited in the album's credits). After high school, Portner and Weitz moved to New York City to attend New York University and Columbia University, respectively. Lennox and Dibb eventually moved to New York City, and the band became more collaborative in nature. They finally settled on the name \\"Animal Collective\\". Although the band's output is, as their name suggests, a collaborative effort, with no typical 'frontman,' Portner has been cited by the other members as being the 'primary songwriter' and de facto leader of the group. For the band's Centipede Hz, Tare confirmed that the album has eight songs penned by him.

His greatest fame came during the late 1980s and early 1990s when he was a major figure in the San Francisco comedy scene and began appearing on HBO comedy specials. He had the nick name 'Warranty'. He won the San Francisco International Comedy Competition in 1987. Thomas was cited as the funniest comedian alive by Greg Proops. Because of its speed, rhythm and flow, his comedy was often compared to jazz music. Warren mentored Jamie Foxx and worked with Dave Chappelle. His television appearances included Comedy Central's Comics Come Home special, The Dennis Miller Show, and Late Night with Conan O'Brien and Premium Blend. He was a writer on In Living Color and Air America Radio, and he was a frequent guest on Rocky Sullivan's \\"Satire for Sanity\\" show. He also was working on a project with Jamie Foxx. Upon Thomas's death, memorials were held in his honor in New York City, where he had been living and working, in Los Angeles, and in his hometown of San Francisco. Mourners included his friends Robin Williams, Barry Crimmins, A. Whitney Brown, Janeane Garofalo, Greg Proops, Will Durst, Bob Rubin, Sue Murphy, Tom Rhodes, Randy Kagan, Kurt Weitzmann, David Feldman, Charles Ezell, Barry Lank, Martin Olsen, and Barry Sobel.

It is rare in nature only being found in meteorites, and some antibiotics of fungal origin, such as alamethicin and some lantibiotics. Synthesis In the laboratory, 2-aminoisobutyric acid may be prepared from acetone cyanohydrin, by reaction with ammonia followed by hydrolysis.. Industrial scale synthesis can be achieved by the selective hydroamination of methacrylic acid. Biological activity 2-Aminoisobutyric acid is not one of the proteinogenic amino acids and is rather rare in nature (cf. non-proteinogenic amino acids). It is a strong helix inducer in peptides. Oligomers of AIB form 310 helices. 3-Aminoisobutyric acid, or BAIBA, is found as a normal metabolite of skeletal muscle in 2014. The plasma concentrations are increased in human by exercise. The production is likely a result of enhanced mitochondrial activity as the increase is also observed in the muscle of PGC-1a overexpression mice. BAIBA is proposed as protective factor against metabolic disorder since it can induce brown fat function.  Ribosomal incorporation into peptides  Several reports have confirmed the compatibility of 2-aminoisobutyric acid with ribosomal elongation of peptide synthesis. Katoh et al. used flexizymes and an engineered a tRNA body to enhance the affinity of aminoacylated AIB-tRNA species to elongation factor-P. The result was an increased incorporation of AIB into peptides in a cell free translation system. Iqbal et al.. used an alternative approach of creating an editing deficient valine tRNA-ligase to synthesize aminoacylated AIB-tRNAVal. The aminoacylated tRNA was subsequently used in a cell-free translation system to yield AIB-containing peptides.

Long associated with Seattle label Sub Pop and the grunge movement, Endino worked on seminal albums from bands including Mudhoney, Soundgarden and Nirvana. Endino was also the guitarist for the Seattle band Skin Yard, which was active between 1985 and 1992. Endino currently manages a studio in Seattle called Soundhouse Recording. Early career In 1985, Endino and Daniel House started the influential grunge band Skin Yard. Though originally a drummer, Endino played guitar and Matt Cameron played drums until he left for Soundgarden. In 1986, Skin Yard contributed two songs to C/Z Records' legendary grunge compilation Deep Six. In July 1986, Endino left his basement recording studio to found Reciprocal Recording with Chris Hanzsek, the Deep Six sound engineer, where he used his self-taught recording skills to produce, engineer, and mix Skin Yard's 1987 debut album Skin Yard. His skill and low fees meant that he was soon an engineer of choice for up-and-coming Seattle grunge bands, and in 1988, he recorded Nirvana's debut album Bleach in a mere 30 hours for $606.17, using reel-to-reel 8-track machine. The album did well in the underground, and after the success of 1991's Nevermind it went platinum. After Reciprocal Recording closed in July 1991, Endino continued as a freelance producer and engineer, producing several albums including Bruce Dickinson's Skunkworks. He appeared in the 1996 grunge documentary Hype!, where he's humorously referred to as \\"the godfather of grunge.\\" Endino was also interviewed at length for the 2009 book, Grunge is Dead: The Oral History of Seattle Rock Music.  Recording and production work  :See Jack Endino discography for a chronological list of Endino's recording and production work Endino is known for his stripped down recording practices and his dislike of over-produced music with effects and remastering. Largely because of the success of albums like Soundgarden's Screaming Life and Nirvana's Bleach in the mainstream, the resulting raw, unpolished sound is still seen as a defining characteristic of the grunge movement. In the Pacific Northwest, he's done work for underground legends like Green River, Screaming Trees, L7, The Gits, Hole, 7 Year Bitch, The Fartz, Supersuckers, TAD, the thrashcore band The Acc√ºsed, Willard and ZEKE. Endino mastered or produced nearly every album by The Grannies. He continues to work with influential underground bands, and in 2007 he recorded an album with the proto-grunge band Flipper. Other projects have included the bands SixTwoSeven, High on Fire, Windhand, Hot Hot Heat, Toxic Holocaust, Lucid Nation, and Valient Thorr. Internationally, Endino is well known for his work with the Brazilian super-band Tit√£s, who he‚Äôs recorded since 1993. He also produced three albums by the Mexican grunge- like band Guillotina, two albums by the British rockers Winnebago Deal, and worked with Irish band Therapy?, Iron Maiden singer Bruce Dickinson, French punk rockers Burning Heads, the Australian band Spiderbait and the Argentinian band Banda de la Muerte. As an artist Endino released his first solo album, Angle of Attack, in 1989. Skin Yard disbanded in 1992, and he released a second solo album, Endino's Earthworm, in 1993. In October 2005 he released his third solo album, Permanent Fatal Error. He is currently second guitarist in the band Kandi Coded, which also features Volcom snowboarding pro Jamie Lynn.

ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒøŒ∏Œ≠œÑŒ±Œπ, logoth√©tai; Med. , pl. logothetae; ; ; ; , logotet) was an administrative title originating in the eastern Roman Empire. In the middle and late Byzantine Empire, it rose to become a senior administrative title, equivalent to a minister or secretary of state. The title spread to other states influenced by Byzantine culture, such as Bulgaria, Sicily, Serbia, and the Danubian Principalities. Byzantine Empire =Origin and development= In Greek, logothetƒìs means \\"one who accounts, calculates or ratiocinates\\", literally \\"one who sets the word\\". The exact origin of the title is unclear; it is found in papyri and works of the Church Fathers denoting a variety of junior officials, mostly charged with fiscal duties.. The ancestors of the middle Byzantine logothetes were the fiscal officials known as rationales during Late Antiquity. The office dates back to at least the time of Emperor Septimius Severus (), where a procurator a rationibus is attested. In late Roman times, the rationales were officials attached to the praetorian prefectures and charged with supervising the state treasury and the emperor's private domains. The first notable official titled as a logothete was Marinus, the future praetorian prefect and chief minister of Emperor Anastasius I (). In the 6th century, under Emperor Justinian I (), the logothetes gained in prominence and power, as they were placed in charge of the emperor's revenue-gathering measures and dispatched as fiscal agents to the provinces or accompanied military expeditions. They were allowed to keep a twelfth of the sums they would gather for the treasury, and some, such as the notorious Alexander \\"Scissors\\", amassed considerable fortunes in this way. The major transformation of the office came in the early 7th century: during the Heraclian dynasty, the administrative machinery of the state, inherited from the time of Diocletian and Constantine the Great, was thoroughly reformed. Thus the three chief financial \\"departments\\" of the old system, the Praetorian Prefecture, the Sacred Largesses (sacrae largitiones) and the Private Domains (res privata) were replaced by smaller specialized departments titled logothesia (sing. logothesion) or sekreta (sing. sekreton). This process was the result of severe territorial loss and the need to rationalize revenue collection during the final Byzantine‚ÄìPersian War and the Muslim conquests, but had already been presaged by Emperor Justinian's reforms in the 6th century, when the res privata, responsible for the managing of imperial estates, had been divided by kind into five separate departments. By the mid-7th century, the sacrae largitiones too disappeared altogether, while its various sections, as those of the praetorian prefecture, were separated and set up as autonomous departments, some of them headed by a logothete. These were under the supervision of the sakellarios, who functioned as a \\"general comptroller of finances\\", and ultimately of the emperor himself. The first mention of a logothete in a senior position was the \\"most glorious logothete and patrician\\" Theodosios in 626, possibly either in charge of the genikon or the strati≈çtikon. Although the first concrete evidence for the existence of many of the subsequent offices is often of a much later date, the chief departments, the genikon, the (e)idikon, the strati≈çtikon and the dromos were in place by the late 7th century. There were also logothetes in the church, assisting the patriarch and the metropolitan bishops, while a logothetƒìs tou praitoriou was a senior official under the Eparch of Constantinople. Under Emperor Alexios I Komnenos (), the logothete of the bureaux (logothetƒìs t≈çn sekret≈çn) was instituted, who supervised all state departments, evolving eventually into the Grand Logothete (megas logothetƒìs) of the late Byzantine Empire. By the Palaiologan period, the various logothetes had vanished or were converted into purely honorary titles. =Logothetes= *The logothetƒìs tou dromou (), in English usually rendered as Logothete of the Course/Drome/Dromos or Postal Logothete, responsible for the imperial post, diplomacy and intelligence. In the 10th‚Äì11th centuries, its holder often functioned as the Byzantine Empire's chief minister. *The logothetƒìs tou genikou (), often called genikos logothetƒìs or simply ho genikos (), and usually rendered in English as the General Logothete. He was in charge of the \\"general financial ministry\\", the genikon logothesion, responsible for general taxation and revenue. *The logothetƒìs tou strati≈çtikou (), the Logothete of the Military [Fisc], was in charge of the pay and provisioning of the Byzantine army, although his exact duties are somewhat obscure. *The logothetƒìs t≈çn agel≈çn (), in English the Logothete of the Herds, was responsible for the state-run estates (mƒìtata) in western Asia Minor that reared horses and mules for the army and the imperial Public Post. *The epi tou eidikou or simply the eidikos (\\"the one responsible for the Special Affairs Department\\"): responsible for the (e)idikon logothesion, which supervised the imperial treasury, factories, storehouses, and monopolies. According to some scholars, an evolution of the Roman comes rerum privatarum. *The logothetƒìs tou prait≈çriou () or Logothete of the Praetorium, one of the two principal aides of the Eparch of Constantinople, probably charged with judicial and policing duties. *The logothetƒìs t≈çn hydat≈çn (), the \\"logothete of the waters\\", an obscure official who is mentioned only once. Possibly to be identified with the komƒìs hydat≈çn (\\"Count of the Waters\\"), an official in charge of the aqueducts. *The logothetƒìs t≈çn oikeiak≈çn (), in charge of the oikeiakoi (\\"of the household\\") class of palace officials, and carrying out a variety of fiscal and judicial duties. *The megas logothetƒìs (ŒºŒ≠Œ≥Œ±œÇ ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒøŒ∏Œ≠œÑŒ∑œÇ) or \\"Grand Logothete\\", originally established as the logothetƒìs t≈çn sekret≈çn (ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒøŒ∏Œ≠œÑŒ∑œÇ œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ œÉŒµŒ∫œÅŒ≠œÑœâŒΩ) by Alexios I Komnenos to supervise and coordinate the other government departments (sekreta). Logothetes outside Byzantium =Serbia= The title logotet () was used in Serbia in the Middle Ages since the rule of King Stefan Milutin (). Notable title-holders include Rajko, Joanikije, Pribac, Gojko, Voihna, Pahomije and Stefan Ratkoviƒá. =Sicily= Holy Roman Emperor Otto III (), the son of the Byzantine princess Theophanu, bestowed it on his chancellor, Leo of Vercelli (999‚Äì1026). In the end, it only became firmly established in Sicily, where the logothete occupied the position of chancellor elsewhere, his office being equal if not superior to that of the Magnus Cancellarius. Thus, the title was borne for example by Pietro della Vigna, the all-powerful minister of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II (), king of Sicily. =Romanian principalities= The title was also borrowed in the internal organization of the medieval Romanian countries, Moldavia and Wallachia. In Moldavia, the Great Logothete (mare logofƒÉt) was the chief minister of the prince and head of the chancellery, while in Wallachia, he was the second-most senior member of the prince's council, after the ban. Several other officials were also called logothetes: *Second Logothete (logofƒÉt al doilea), deputy of the Great Logothete. *Third Logothete (logofƒÉt al treilea), secretary of the Great Logothete. *Logothete of the Treasury (logofƒÉt de vistierie). *Logothete of the Chamber (logofƒÉt de cƒÉmarƒÉ). *Logothete of the Ceremonies (logofƒÉt de obiceiuri) *Logothete of the Secrets (logofƒÉt de tainƒÉ) or Royal Logothete (LogofƒÉt domnesc), private secretary of the prince. =Modern Era= Former U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt accused then-President Woodrow Wilson of being a \\"Byzantine logothete.\\" The epithet insinuated that, like pencil- pushing Byzantine logothetes, or administrators, Wilson was dillydallying by not declaring America's participation in World War I.https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2012/byzantium-and- islam/blog/cultural-connections/posts/byzantine See also *Byzantine aristocracy and bureaucracy *Chancellor *Lord Chancellor *Vestiarion References Sources   Byzantine administrative offices Titles Medieval chancellors (government) ","title":"Logothete"},{"id":"2976202","text":"right Manes ( ) is an unincorporated community in Wright County, Missouri, United States.

The name is said by Cicero to be derived from laena, the sacerdotal cloak carried by Marcus Popillius Laenas (consul 359 BC) when he went to the Forum to quell a popular rising. The family Laenas is therefore a branch of the family Popilli, but the only branch which rose to the consulship. Famous holders of the name are: * Marcus Popillius M.f. Laenas, four times plebeian consul in 359 BC, 356 BC, 350 BC and 348 BC, probable ancestor of the next consuls of that name * Marcus Popillius M.f. Laenas, consul in 316 BC, possibly son of the above * Marcus Popillius Laenas (consul 173 BC), notable for conducting a war without the consent of the Senate, and saved from trial (by the tribunes of the plebs) by his brother. Despite this scandal, he became censor in 159 BC. * Gaius Popillius Laenas, consul in 172 BC and 158 BC, and brother of the preceding (both were sons of Publius Popillius Laenas). He was sent to Greece in 174 BC to allay the general disaffection, but met with little success. He took part in the war against Perseus of Macedon (Livy xliii.17, 22). When Antiochus Epiphanes, king of Syria, invaded Egypt, Laenas was sent to arrest his progress. Meeting him near Alexandria, he handed him the decree of the Senate, demanding the evacuation of Egypt. Antiochus having asked time for consideration, Laenas drew a circle round him with his staff, and told him he must give an answer before he stepped out of it. Antiochus thereupon submitted.Livy xlv.12; Polybius xxix.11; Cicero, Philippica, viii.8; Velleius Paterculus i.10. * Marcus Popillius Laenas, consul 139 BC * Publius Popillius Laenas, son of the preceding. When consul in 132 BC he incurred the hatred of the democrats by his harsh measures as head of a special commission appointed to take measures against the accomplices of Tiberius Gracchus. In 123 BC Gaius Gracchus brought in a bill prohibiting all such commissions, and declared that, in accordance with the old laws of appeal, a magistrate who pronounced sentence of death against a citizen, without the people's assent, should be guilty of high treason. It is not known whether the bill contained a retrospective clause against Laenas, but he left Rome and sentence of banishment from Italy was pronounced against him. After the restoration of the aristocracy the enactments against him were cancelled, and he was recalled.See Cicero, Brutus, 25.34, and De domo sua, 31; Velleius Paterculus ii.7; Plutarch, C.

The juxtaposition of her education and class background with her career attracted media attention. In the spring of 2007, she again attracted public interest, this time for being convicted of being a practicing psychologist without a license in two South Shore Massachusetts communities. Currently she works as a writer, photographer, and blogger. Dance career Wightman's dancing career began at age 17, when she was known as Lucy Johnson, and peaked when she was a headliner at the now defunct Naked i Cabaret in Boston's Combat Zone. \\"Princess Cheyenne\\" was a local legend in Boston. The Boston Herald would later call her \\"perhaps the most famous exotic dancer ever in this town.\\" Sports columnist Bill Reynolds called her a \\"cult figure.\\" Journalist Howard Altman, reminiscing about her in the Philadelphia City Paper, called her \\"Boston's favorite stripper.\\" Although she is not named, Wightman is described in Lauri Lewin's Combat Zone memoir, Naked is the Best Disguise: My Life as a Stripper. Using her celebrity from the exotic dancing circuit, Wightman later hosted a sex advice radio talk show called \\"Ask Princess Cheyenne\\" on Boston rock station WBCN, and posed for Playboy magazine (as Lucy Johnson) in March 1986. She competed in women's bodybuilding contests, winning the 1993 National Physique Committee Massachusetts championship and later being featured in the May‚ÄìJune 1996 issue of Women's Physique World. =\\"The thinking man's stripper\\"= As an articulate woman from a well-to-do family, Wightman did not conform to the popular stereotype of an exotic dancer, and gained a reputation as \\"the thinking man's stripper.\\" A Boston Globe reporter, writing in 1979, called her \\"the valedictorian of strippers.\\" The president of the Harvard Lampoon invited her to perform at a banquet in 1982, calling her \\"a nice and educated girl\\"; a few years later, a writer in Harvard Magazine noted with interest that Wightman, \\"one of the premier strippers\\" in the Combat Zone, was working her way through college. (The Naked i Cabaret, where Wightman performed, proudly advertised its \\"Totally Nude College Girls Revue.\\") In Women's Physique World she was described as \\"Lucy Wightman: 138 I.Q., 285 Bench!\\" Psychotherapy career In 1985, Wightman received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Emerson College, and subsequently earned a masters degree in counseling psychology from Lesley University. She then enrolled at the Massachusetts School of Professional Psychology for five years, from 1996 to 2001. Wightman then withdrew from MSPP, submitted her credits and hours to an online degree program to which she paid $1,299 to receive a doctorate in psychology from Concordia College and University, an online institution based in Dominica that is not recognized for licensure by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. During this same period, Wightman founded South Shore Psychology Associates, and began treating patients with psychotherapy in her Norwell office. Legal problems In October 2005, Wightman was indicted in Boston, Massachusetts for practicing psychology without a license, filing false health care claims, and engaging in insurance fraud after local FOX affiliate WFXT did an undercover investigation into her therapy practice. Under unusual provisions of Massachusetts law, Wightman had been allowed to practice as a psychotherapist, not as a psychologist. In the indictment, the Commonwealth charged that she never applied for or received a license to practice as a psychologist in Massachusetts, which requires a doctoral degree in psychology from a state- approved program. Wightman was found guilty of 19 of 26 counts and sentenced to six months in jail and five years probation. The six-month sentence was suspended, sparing her prison time. Under the terms of her probation, she was sentenced to one year of home confinement, and was barred from practicing as a psychotherapist for her entire probationary period. Personal life In 1979, Wightman was engaged to the singer Cat Stevens, but the couple broke up due to her career commitments and his conversion to Islam. After the breakup with Stevens, Wightman married and divorced twice; she had a daughter named Victoria (Torri) with her second husband Donald Wightman, a Boston police detective and head of security for the rock band Aerosmith. On May 16, 2006, 16-year-old Torri died as result of injuries sustained in an automobile accident in Plympton, Massachusetts.

The organization was active between 27 May 1945 and 1950-51, when it dissolved itself. Sh'erit ha-Pletah () is Hebrew for surviving remnant, and is a term from the Book of Ezra and 1 Chronicles (; ). A total of more than 250,000 Jewish survivors spent several years following their liberation in DP camps or communities in Germany, Austria, and Italy, since they could not, or would not, be repatriated to their countries of origin. The refugees became socially and politically organized, advocating at first for their political and human rights in the camps, and then for the right to emigrate to the countries of their choice, preferably British-ruled Mandatory Palestine, the USA and Canada. By 1950, the largest part of them did end up living in those countries; meanwhile British Palestine had become the Jewish State of Israel. Formation of the DP camps School children at Schauenstein DP camp in 1946 In an effort to destroy the evidence of war crimes, Nazi authorities and military staff accelerated the pace of killings, forced victims on death marches, and attempted to deport many of them away from the rapidly shrinking German lines. As the German war effort collapsed, survivors were typically left on their own, on trains, by the sides of roads, and in camps. Concentration camps and death camps were liberated by Allied forces in the final stages of the war, beginning with Majdanek, in July 1944, and Auschwitz, in January 1945; Buchenwald, Bergen- Belsen, Dachau, Mauthausen, and other camps were liberated in April and May 1945.United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. \\"Liberation.\\" Holocaust Encyclopedia.

Jews. The vast majority of non-Jewish DPs were repatriated in a matter of months.According to K√∂nigseder and Wetzel (p. 15), in September 1945 there were a total of approximately one million DPs remaining, who, for various reasons, such as political differences with the new regime in their homeland, or fear of persecution, were considered to be \\"non-repatriable.\\" The number of Jewish DPs, however, subsequently grew many fold as Jewish refugees from Eastern Europe migrated westward. It is estimated that a total of more than 250,000 Jewish DPs resided in camps or communities in Germany, Austria, and Italy during the period from 1945 to 1952. In the first weeks after liberation, Allied military forces improvised relief in the form of shelter, food, and medical care. A large number of refugees were in critical condition as a result of malnutrition, abuse, and disease. Many died, but medical material was requisitioned from military stores and German civilian facilities. Military doctors as well as physicians among the survivors themselves used available resources to help a large number recover their physical health. The first proper funerals of Holocaust victims took place during this period with the assistance of Allied forces and military clergy. Shelter was also improvised in the beginning, with refugees of various origins being housed in abandoned barracks, hotels, former concentration camps, and private homes. As Germany and Austria came under Allied military administration, the commanders assumed responsibility for the safety and disposition of all displaced persons. The Allies provided for the DPs according to nationality, and initially did not recognize Jews as constituting a separate group. One significant consequence of this early perspective was that Jewish DPs sometimes found themselves housed in the same quarters with former Nazi collaborators.K√∂nigseder and Wetzel, 16.Mankowitz, Zeev W. Life between Memory and Hope: The Survivors of the Holocaust in Occupied Germany. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2002. 13. Also, the general policy of the Allied occupation forces was to repatriate DPs to their country of origin as soon as possible, and there was not necessarily sufficient consideration for exceptions; repatriation policy varied from place to place, but Jewish DPs, for whom repatriation was problematic, were apt to find themselves under pressure to return home.Mankowitz, 12-16. General George Patton, the commander of the United States Third Army and military governor of Bavaria, where most of the Jewish DPs resided, was known for pursuing a harsh, indiscriminate repatriation policy.Mankowitz, 16.Brenner, Michael. After the Holocaust: Rebuilding Jewish Lives in Postwar Germany. Trans. Barbara Harshav. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1997. 15. However, his approach raised objections from the refugees themselves, as well as from American military and civilian parties sympathetic to their plight. In early July 1945, Patton issued a directive that the entire Munich area was to be cleared of displaced persons with an eye toward repatriating them. Joseph Dunner, an American officer who in civilian life was a professor of political science, sent a memorandum to military authorities protesting the order. When 90 trucks of the Third Army arrived at Buchberg to transport the refugees there, they refused to move, citing Dunner's memo. Based on these efforts and blatant antisemitic remarks, Patton was relieved of this command.J√ºrgen Matth√§us (ed). Approaching an Auschwitz Survivor: Holocaust Testimony and its Transformations.

Harrison was sent by president Truman to investigate conditions among the \\"non-repatriables\\" in the DP camps.

Harrison's report was met with consternation in Washington, and its contrast with Patton's position ultimately contributed to Patton being relieved of his command in Germany in September 1945. Growth of the camps The number of refugees in the DP camps continued to grow as displaced Jews who were in Western Europe at war's end were joined by hundreds of thousands of refugees from Eastern Europe. Many of these were Polish Jews who had initially been repatriated. Nearly 90% of the approximately 200,000 Polish Jews who had survived the war in the Soviet Union chose to return to Poland under a Soviet- Polish repatriation agreement.K√∂nigseder, Angelika, and Juliane Wetzel. Waiting for Hope: Jewish Displaced Persons in Post-World War II Germany. Trans. John A. Broadwin. Evanston, Illinois: Northwestern University Press, 2001. 45. But Jews returning to their erstwhile homes in Poland met with a generally hostile reception from their non-Jewish neighbors. Between fall 1944 and summer 1946 as many as 600 Jews were killed in anti-Jewish riots in various towns and cities,Engel, David. \\"Poland since 1939\\".

Retrieved 9 June 2014. including incidents in Cracow, around August 20, 1945;\\"Serious Anti-Jewish Disturbances in Cracow; Local Council Blames Reactionary Poles.\\" Jewish Telegraphic Agency, 21 August 1945. Sosnowiec, on October 25; and Lublin, on November 19. Most notable was the pogrom in Kielce on July 4, 1946, in which 42 Jews were killed.K√∂nigseder and Wetzel, 46. In the course of 1946 the flight of Jewish refugees from Eastern Europe toward the West amounted to a mass exodus that swelled the ranks of DPs in Germany and Austria, especially in the U.S. Zone.K√∂nigseder and Wetzel, 43. Although hundreds of DP camps were in operation between 1945 and 1948, the refugees were mostly segregated, with several camps being dedicated to Jews. These camps varied in terms of the conditions afforded to the refugees, how they were managed, and the composition of their population. In the American sector, the Jewish community across many camps organized itself rapidly for purposes of representation and advocacy. In the British sector, most refugees were concentrated in the Bergen-Belsen displaced persons camp and were under tighter control. Humanitarian services in the DP camps The Allies had begun to prepare for the humanitarian aftermath of the war while it was still going on, with the founding of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), on 9 November 1943. However, the beginnings of the agency were plagued by organizational problems and corruption.Shephard, Ben. The Long Road Home: The Aftermath of the Second World War. New York: Knopf, 2011. 138-164. The military authorities were, in any case, reluctant to yield significant responsibility for the DP assembly centers to a civilian organization, until it became clear that there would be a need to house and care for the DPs for an extended period of time.K√∂nigseder and Wetzel, 28. At the point when it was supposed to begin its work the UNRRA was woefully understaffed in view of the larger than expected numbers of DPs, and additional staff that were hastily recruited were poorly trained.K√∂nigseder and Wetzel, 28-29. The agency began to send staff into the field in summer 1945; its mission had been conceived mainly as a support to the repatriation process, including providing medical services, and assuring the delivery of adequate nutrition, as well as attending to the DPs' needs for comfort and entertainment; however, it often fell short of fulfilling these functions.Shephard, 140, 145-146. As of 15 November 1945, the UNRRA officially assumed responsibility for the administration of the camps, while remaining generally subordinate to the military, which continued to provide for housing and security in the camps, as well as the delivery of food, clothing, and medical supplies. Over time the UNRRA supplemented the latter basic services with health and welfare services, recreational facilities, self-help programs, and vocational guidance.K√∂nigseder and Wetzel, 29-30. By the time that the UNRRA took the reins of administration of the camps, the Jewish DPs had already begun to elect their own representatives, and were vocal about their desire for self- governance. However, since camp committees did not yet have any officially sanctioned role, their degree of power and influence depended at first on the stance of the particular UNRRA director at the given camp.K√∂nigseder and Wetzel, 97. The UNRRA was active mainly through the end of 1946 and had wound down its operations by mid 1947. In late 1947 a new successor organization, the International Refugee Organization (IRO) absorbed some of the UNRRA staff and assumed its responsibilities, but with a focus turned toward resettlement, as well as care of the most vulnerable DPs, rather than repatriation.K√∂nigseder and Wetzel, 64-65. A number of other organizations played an active role in the emerging Jewish community in the DP camps. The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (\\"Joint\\") provided financial support and supplies from American sources; in the British sector, the Jewish Relief Unit acted as the British equivalent to the Joint; and the ORT established numerous vocational and other training. From representation to autonomy The refugees who found themselves in provisional, sparse quarters under military guard soon spoke up against the ironic nature of their liberation, invoking an oft-repeated slogan \\"From Dachau to Feldafing.\\" Leo Walder Schwarz. The Redeemers: A Saga of the Years 1945-1952. New York: Farrar Straus and Young, 1953. 19. Working committees were established in each camp, and on July 1, 1945 the committees met for a founding session of a federation for Jewish DP camp committees in Feldafing. The session also included representatives of the Jewish Brigade and the Allied military administration. It resulted in the formation of a provisional council and an executive committee chaired by Zalman Grinberg. Patton's attempt at repatriating Jewish refugees had resulted in a resolve within the Sh'erit ha-Pletah to define their own destiny. The various camp committees convened a General Jewish Survivors‚Äô Conference a conference for the entire Sh'erit ha-Pletah at the St. Ottilien camp attended by delegates representing Holocaust survivors from forty-six Displaced Persons camps in both the American and the British Zones of Occupied Germany and Austria. The delegates passed a fourteen-point program that established a broad mandate, including the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine with UN recognition, compensation to victims, participation in the trials against Nazi war criminals, archival of historical records, and full autonomy for the committees. However, the survivor organizations in the American and British Zones remain separate after the conference and the American and British sectors developed independent organization structures. The center for the British sector in Germany was at the Bergen-Belsen DP camp, where Josef Rosensaft had been the primus motor for establishing what became the Central Committee for Displaced Persons in the British zone. In the American sector, Zalman Grinberg and Samuel Gringauz and others led the formation of the Central Committee of the Liberated Jews, which was to establish offices first in the former Deutsches Museum and then in Siebertstrasse 3 in Munich. The central organizations for Jewish refugees had an overwhelming number of issues to resolve, among them: *Ensuring healthy and dignified living conditions for the refugees living in various camps and installations *Establishing political legitimacy for themselves by establishing a constitution with a political process with debates, elections, etc. *Facilitating and encouraging religious, educational, and cultural expression within the camps *Arranging for employment for the refugees, though not in enterprises that would contribute to the German economy *Supporting the absorption in the camp infrastructure of \\"new\\" refugees arriving from Eastern Europe *Resolving acrimonious and sometimes violent disputes between the camps and German police *Managing the public image of displaced persons, particularly with respect to black market activities *Advocating immigration destinations for the refugees, in particular to the British Mandate in Palestine, but also the United States, Australia, and elsewhere Military authorities were at first reluctant to officially recognize the central committees as the official representatives of the Jewish refugees in DP camps, though cooperation and negotiations carried characteristics of a de facto acceptance of their mandate. But on September 7, 1946, at a meeting in Frankfurt, the American military authorities recognized the Central Committee of the Liberated Jews as a legitimate party to the issue of the Jewish displaced persons in the American sector. Political activism What the people of the Sh'erit ha-Pletah had in common was what had made them victims in the first place, but other than that they were a diverse group. Their outlook, needs, and aspirations varied tremendously. There were strictly observant Jews as well as individuals that had earlier been assimilated into secular culture. Religious convictions ran from the Revisionist group to Labor Zionists and even ideological communists. Although Yiddish was the common language within the community, individuals came from virtually every corner of Europe. There was lively political debate, involving satire, political campaigns, and the occasional acrimony. The growth of Yiddish newspapers within the camps added fuel to the political culture. The political environment of the community evolved during its years of existence. In the first year or two, it was predominantly focused on improving the conditions in the camps and asserting the legitimacy of the community as an autonomous entity. Over time, the emphasis shifted to promoting the Zionist goals of allowing immigration into the British Mandate in Palestine; political divisions within the Sh'erit ha-Pletah mirrored those found in the Yishuv itself. At every turn, the community expressed its opposition and outrage against British restrictions on Jewish immigration to Palestine. In the British sector, the protests approached a level of civil disobedience; in the American sector, attempts were made to apply political pressure to alleviate these restrictions. The relationship between Sh'erit ha-Pletah and British authorities remained tense until the State of Israel was formed. This came to a head when Lieutenant General Sir Frederick E. Morgan ‚Äì then UNRRA chief of operations in Germany ‚Äì claimed that the influx of Jewish refugees from Eastern Europe as \\"nothing short of a skillful campaign of anti-British aggression on the part of Zion aided and abetted by Russia... [meaning] death to the British.\\" (Morgan was allowed to remain in his post after this comment but was fired when making similar comments later). In late 1945, the UNRRA conducted several surveys among Jewish refugees, asking them to list their preferred destination for emigration. Among one population of 19,000, 18,700 named \\"Palestine\\" as their first choice, and 98% also named \\"Palestine\\" as their second choice. At the camp in F√ºrth, respondents were asked not to list Palestine as both their first and second choice, and 25% of the respondents then wrote \\"crematorium\\". Mark Wyman: DPs: Europe's Displaced Persons, 1945‚Äì1951. Ithaca, 1989 and 1998. Cornell University Press. All the while, the Sh'erit ha-Pletah retained close relationships with the political leadership of the Yishuv, prompting several visits from David Ben-Gurion and other Zionist leaders. While officially detached from the committees, there was considerable support for clandestine immigration to Palestine through the Aliya Beth programs among the refugees; and tacit support for these activities also among American, UNRRA, Joint and other organizations. A delegation (consisting of Norbert Wollheim, Samuel Schlumowitz, Boris Pliskin, and Leon Retter flew to the United States to raise funds for the community, appealing to a sense of pride over \\"schools built for our children, four thousand pioneers on the farms... thousands of youths in trades schools... self- sacrifice of doctors, teachers, writers... democratization... hard-won autonomy,\\"Boris Pliskin et al: An Evaluation of the AJDC Program in the American Occupied Zone of Germany from its inception to January 1947. American Joint Distribution Committee and also met with officials at the US War Department and Sir Raphael Salento over the formation of the International Refugee Organization. Over time, the Sh'erit ha-Pletah took on the characteristics of a state in its own right. It coordinated efforts with the political leadership in the Yishuv and the United States, forming a transient power triangle within the Jewish world. It sent its own delegation to the Twenty-Second Zionist Congress in Basel. A community dedicated to its own dissolution With the exception of 10,000‚Äì15,000 who chose to make their homes in Germany after the war (see Central Council of Jews in Germany), the vast majority of the Jewish DPs ultimately left the camps and settled elsewhere. About 136,000 settled in Israel, 80,000 in the United States, and sizeable numbers also in Canada and South Africa. Although the community established many of the institutions that characterize a durable society, and indeed came to dominate an entire section of Munich, the overriding imperative was to find new homes for the refugees. To make the point, many of the leaders emigrated at the first possible opportunity. Both overt lobbying efforts and underground migration sought to open for unrestricted immigration to Palestine. And the camps largely emptied once the state of Israel was established, many of the refugees immediately joining the newly formed Israel Defense Forces to fight the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The Central Committee in the American sector declared its dissolution on December 17, 1950 at the Deutsche Museum in Munich. Of the original group that founded the committee, only Rabbi Samuel Snieg remained for the dissolution. All the others had already emigrated, most of them to Israel. Rabbi Snieg had remained to complete the first full edition of the Talmud published in Europe after the Holocaust, the so-called Survivors' Talmud. The last DP camp, F√∂hrenwald, closed in February 1957, by then populated only by the so-called \\"hardcore\\" cases, elderly, and those disabled by disease. Legacy While most Holocaust survivors view their time in the DP camps as a transitional state, the Sh'erit ha-Pletah became an organizing force for the repatriation of the remnant in general and to Israel in particular. Its experience highlighted the challenges of ethnic groups displaced in their entirety without recourse to their original homes. It also demonstrated the resolve and ingenuity of individuals who had lost everything but made a new life for themselves. Some struggled with survivor guilt for decades. Suicide amongst survivors has been a subject of some disagreement amongst Israeli medical professionals. In 1947, Dr. Aharon Persikovitz, a gynecologist who had survived the Dachau concentration camp gave a lecture called \\"The Psychological State Of the New Immigrant\\" in which he said: \\"Holocaust survivors do not commit suicide; they heroically prove the continuity of the Jewish people\\". According to Professor Yoram Barak this statement became \\"an accepted national myth\\". Barak says \\"The survivors themselves also did not want to be stigmatized as \`sick, weak and broken;' rather, they wanted to join in the myth of the heroic sabra who just recently fought a glorious War of Independence against the enemy.\\" See also *Aftermath of World War II *Beni Virtzberg *Bereavement in Judaism *Jewish history *Survivor guilt *Sam Dubbin References Further reading *Angelika K√∂nigseder and Juliane Wetzel: Waiting for Hope: Jewish Displaced Persons in Post-World War II Germany.

The school offers MBA (full-time, part-time, executive), PGPX, Financial Engineering and Ph.D. degrees. The school is consistently ranked among the top tier business school programs in the country, based on rankings published by US News & World Report, Businessweek and other leading publications. The range of programs offered by Anderson includes: * Accounting minor for undergraduates * Full Time MBA program * Ph.D. * Fully Employed MBA * Executive MBA * Master of Financial Engineering *Master of Science in Business Analytics * Global EMBA for Asia Pacific * Global EMBA for the Americas * Post Graduate Program in Management for Executives (UCLA PGPX) * Post Graduate Program in Management for Professionals (UCLA PGP PRO) History Collins Center at the UCLA Anderson School of Management The School of Management at UCLA was founded in 1935, and the MBA degree was authorized by the UC Regents four years later. In its early years the school was primarily an undergraduate institution, although this began to change in the 1950s after the appointment of Neil H. Jacoby as dean; the last undergraduate degree was awarded in 1969. UCLA is rare among public universities in the U.S. for not offering undergraduate business administration degrees. Undergraduate degrees in business economics are offered. In 1950, the school was renamed the School of Business Administration. Five years later it became the Graduate School of Business Administration; in the 1970s the school‚Äôs name was changed again to the Graduate School of Management. In 1987, John E. Anderson (1917‚Äì2011), class of 1940, donated $15 million to the school and prompted the construction of a new complex at the north end of UCLA‚Äôs campus. He later donated additional $25 million. The 6-building, facility, was designed by Henry N. Cobb of the architectural firm Pei Cobb Freed & Partners and Executive Architects Leidenfrost/Horowitz & Associates. It cost $75 million to construct and opened officially in 1995. On May 13, 2015, Marion Anderson, widow of the late John Anderson, announced a $100 million donation (4th single-largest donation to a business school in the United States) to the school for fellowships and research, along with $40 million earmarked for initiating development of what is now known as the Marion Anderson Hall. Recently, the school has been mostly self-funded, with only $6 million of government funding out of its $96 million budget in 2010-11.Pushback on a B-School's Bold Plan, Inside Higher Ed., November 23, 2010, URL In fall 2010, the school proposed \\"financial self-sufficiency\\": Giving up all state funding, in return for freedom from some state rules and freedom to raise tuition. Critics called this proposal \\"privatization\\", but the school rejected this description, with former Dean Judy Olian saying, \\"This is not privatization.... We will continue to be part of UCLA and part of the state.\\" The proposal met objections in the UCLA Academic Senate (faculty members from all UCLA departments), and is still pending. Update: This decision was approved by the University of California President Mark Yudof in June 2013. In July 2018, Judy D. Olian, who served as dean of UCLA's Anderson School of Management, became Quinnipiac's first female president when she took over for John Lahey, who retired in June 2018. Alfred Osborne, associate senior dean of external affairs and a professor at the UCLA Anderson School of Management, began serving as the school‚Äôs interim dean on July 1, 2018. Antonio Bernardo, a member of the finance faculty since 1994, was appointed UCLA Anderson‚Äôs ninth dean, effective July 1, 2019. Campus Marion Anderson Hall Atrium The school is located on north part of the UCLA campus. The four main buildings, Mullin, Cornell, Entrepreneurs, and Gold, form an inner circle at the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Westwood Plaza, which is the extension of Westwood Boulevard. Connected to the Gold building is the Collins building, which is named for alumnus James A. Collins, who is the chairman emeritus of Sizzler International, Inc. and who funded the John R. Wooden statue in front of Pauley Pavilion.Rebecca Kendall, UCLA unveils statue of Coach John Wooden outside new Pauley Pavilion, UCLA Newsroom, October 26, 2012 The new Marion Anderson Hall addition opened February 12, 2020. The 64,000 square-foot campus addition is estimated to cost $80 million and is one hundred percent donor-funded. Marion Anderson Hall is designed by a collaboration of Gensler, leading the interior architecture, and exterior design by Pei Cobb Freed & Partners, the same architectural firm that designed the original Anderson complex. The new building features four floors, interactive work, learning and event spaces, LEED Platinum certification, and will serve as the prominent entrance to the Anderson complex. Graduate programs =MBA programs= As of 2011, UCLA Anderson enrolls 70 executive MBA, 90 global MBA, 280 fully employed MBA, and 360 full-time MBA students every year. UCLA Anderson‚Äôs teaching model combines case study, experiential learning, lecture and team projects. UCLA Anderson‚Äôs curriculum consists of ten core classes (required courses which cover a broad range of business fundamentals) and twelve (minimum) elective courses. Students are assigned to cohorts, called sections, of 65 students throughout the core curriculum. The cohort system is almost entirely student run, with each cohort electing 17 different leadership positions ranging from President to Ethics chair. In addition, there is the student-led Anderson Student Association (ASA) which deals with all issues of student life including company recruiting, social clubs and academic issues. Students may choose (but are not required) to focus in one or more of the following areas: *Accounting *Decisions, Operations, and Technology Management *Communications, Media, and Entertainment Management *Entrepreneurial Studies *Finance *Global Economics and Management *Human Resources and Organizational Behavior *Information Systems *Marketing *Policy *Real Estate Anderson also offers an Applied Management Research Program (AMR), consisting of a two-quarter team-based strategic consulting field study project required during the second year of study in lieu of the comprehensive exam for the master's degree. Students complete strategic projects for companies partnering with the school, ultimately presenting recommendations to senior management. The program has been around since the late 1960s and is presently led by Professor Gonzalo Freixes, its Faculty Director. In 2004, two alternatives to the field study were introduced: a Business Creation Option, and a research study option. = Executive education = Since 1954, UCLA Anderson has been providing executive education to both organizations and individuals. According to the school the learning is not confined to just campus. The faculty goes out to train leaders across the globe. UCLA PGPX The School also offers a PGPX programme for executives. According to Judy Olian, Dean, UCLA Anderson School of Management, the PGPX program has general management curriculum. UCLA PGPX is a comprehensive programme of one year primarily conducted by senior faculty members from the UCLA Anderson School of Management as well as industry experts. Besides this UCLA Anderson School of Management also offers executive programs on corporate governance, creativity & innovation, women leadership and media. =Doctoral program= The following academic units currently offer doctoral training: *Accounting *Decisions, Operations & Technology Management *Finance *Global Economics and Management *Management and Organizations *Marketing *Strategy Rankings UCLA Anderson has consistently been ranked a first-tier business school, both in United States and international rankings. This ranking is a composite of five major MBA rankings published by Bloomberg BusinessWeek, The Economist, The Financial Times, Forbes, and the U.S. News & World Report which is meant to eliminate anomalies and other statistical distortions that are often present in any single ranking. In 2015, national rankings of UCLA Anderson's MBA program include #13 by Bloomberg BusinessWeek, #15 by U.S. News and World Report, and #17 by Forbes. In global rankings, UCLA Anderson was ranked #6 by The Economist and #34 by Financial Times (#16 in the US). In 2017 UCLA Anderson was ranked #6 by The Economist. =Academic research rankings= UCLA Anderson was ranked 30th worldwide in the Naveen Jindal School of Management's Worldwide Business School Rankings Based on Research Contributions, from 2011 to 2015.

Its quarterly conferences are attended by business, professional, and government decision-makers from across the U.S. The Richard S. Ziman Center For Real Estate was established in 2002. UCLA Anderson also has a Center for International Business Education and Research, which was founded in 1989 as part of a network of 28 CIBERs created by the United States Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. The Center for Managing Enterprises in Media, Entertainment and Sports (MEMES) examines the forces of change on the management of enterprises in entertainment and media including the impacts of technology, consolidation, and globalization. The Center and its predecessors have been around since the late 1970s and have approximately 1,000 graduates in management positions in the media, entertainment, and technology industries. 150-200 MBA students each year participate in classes, lunches with executives, Days on the Job, field studies, speakers, and other activities with the Institute. The student-run organization linked to the MEMES Center is called the Entertainment Management Association (EMA). Alumni The UCLA Anderson alumni network consists of 39,000 members in over 25 chapters in over 75 countries worldwide. Student life Anderson also has a very strong focus on giving back to the community. One of the biggest clubs on campus is the Challenge for Charity, a competition between the top West Coast business schools to put in the most volunteer hours per student and raise the most money for Special Olympics per student. In 2010, Anderson was the #1 school for total volunteer hours.

Small greenish flowers appear in spring, and are borne singly in the centre of the cladodes. The female flowers are followed by a red berry, and the seeds are bird-distributed, but the plant also spreads vegetatively by means of rhizomes. It is native to Eurasia and some northern parts of Africa. Ruscus aculeatus occurs in woodlands and hedgerows, where it is tolerant of deep shade, and also on coastal cliffs. Likely due to its attractive winter/spring color, Ruscus aculeatus has become a fairly common landscape plant. It is also widely planted in gardens, and has spread as a garden escapee in many areas outside its native range. The plant grows well in zones 7 to 9 on the USDA hardiness zone map. The Latin specific epithet aculateus means ‚Äúprickly‚Äù. Plant growth habit  History  = Etymology = The common name, butcher's broom, hails from one of its original uses. In Europe, Ruscus species were traditionally harvested for their flat and stiff branches to make small brooms that were used for clearing off and cleaning butchering blocks. Recent research has uncovered that butcher's broom contains some antibacterial compounds. This suggests that in addition to the functional physical properties of Ruscus species, increased effectiveness in cleaning and producing safer products due to unrecognized antibacterial oils may have contributed to its popularity and subsequent nickname. = Traditional medicinal usage = Butcher's broom has been used by a variety of peoples as a treatment for a variety of ailments. A classical remedy from Europe claimed that the rhizomes could be used as a diuretic. In ancient Greece, butcher's broom was used as a laxative or diuretic, and it was also believed to remove kidney stones when added to wine. Butcher's broom was also used to reduce swelling and to speed the recovery of fractures.  Phytochemicals  The major phytochemicals in butcher's broom are steroidal saponins. Saponins occur naturally in plants as glycosides and have foam forming properties. The specific saponins found in butcher's broom are ruscogenins, ruscogenen and neoruscogenin, named for the genus Ruscus. Ruscogenins function as anti- inflammatory agents and are also believed to cause constriction in veins. Currently the mode of action of ruscogenins is not well understood, but one proposed mechanism suggests that ruscogenins suppresses leukocyte migration through both protein and mRNA regulation. Newer research has also uncovered that there are polyphenols present in butcher's broom may also be physiologically active, possibly as an antioxidant. As of yet there is not enough evidence to make a conclusion, but since they have now been synthesized in labs further research should be in progress.

It was located in the Canadian Broadcasting Centre at 250 Front Street West, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The museum collection began by at least 1960, the current display space opened in 1994, and closed on December 22, 2017.https://mobile.twitter.com/cbcasithappens/status/941358718129762310 The museum featured a number of interactive exhibits where people can call up excerpts from famous CBC television shows, including children's series, news and sport events. History =Early collecting= \\"The men in the promotion department\\" at CBC assembled a museum collection by at least 1960. In 1961, The Globe and Mail mentioned a museum \\"at this point stored in an out-of-the- way CBC building.\\" At the time, it included \\"exhibits which take broadcasting from the crystal-set stage to the transistor radio and portable TV.\\" The majority of items were gathered from collectors. One highlight was a 1000 lbs Blattnerphone steel tape audio recorder, believed by staff to be the only complete model in North America.\\"Early TV Equipment CBC Museum's Pride\\", The Globe and Mail, January 20, 1961, page A6. Around 100,000 people in Aylmer, Ontario saw an exhibit of some of the artifacts in October 1960. Jack Brickenden, a CBC publicist, is said to have \\"dreamed out loud\\" of establishing a museum, in the early 1970s, but network management was unenthusiastic.Sid Adilman, \\"CBC puts its memories on show\\", The Toronto Star, October 22, 2017, page F3. Nevertheless, in 1971, employee Ivan Harris is credited for founding the modern museum collection. (Harris also helped establish the Whitchurch-Stouffville Museum and York-Durham Heritage Railway.)Bruce Stapley, \\"A Bright Light of Stouffville\\", Economist & Sun/Tribune, July 1, 2000, page 3. A museum was operated by the CBC in one of its many Toronto building for some duration of time, closing shortly before 1991. The introduction to an article about \\"exotic\\" museums in the City of Toronto noted that it was \\"a victim of federal cutbacks.\\"Henry Mietkeiwicz, \\"Five museums as exotic as their artifacts\\", The Toronto Star, February 22, 1991, page D3. This display wasn't mentioned in 1994 coverage of the new facility. =New facility= The 16,000 square foot museum opened as part of the corporation's larger Canadian Broadcasting Centre. Prior to its construction, the CBC was spread out in two dozen buildings in 18 locations in Toronto.https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/12/22/farewell-to-the-cbc- museum-a-faded-gem-that-will-be-missed.html The facility was initially operated by volunteers, including retired CBC employee Ivan Harris, its curator. (Harris maintained a curatorial role as of 2002, when he was presented to Queen Elizabeth II on her visit to the building.)Kate Gilderdale, \\"Ivan Harris receives Royal treatment\\", Whitchurch-Stouffville this month, November 2002, page 1. The initial displays included a mock living room offering clips from 24 1950s CBC television series, a listening station with clips from CBC Radio's first decade, photos of CBC personalities, additional audio stations with Lorne Greene, Barbara Frum, and Foster Hewitt, and screens offering clips of television series from the 1960s through 1980s. Physical artifacts included broadcasting equipment, as well as outfits worn by Juliette, Tommy Hunter, Bob Homme, and Cross-Canada Hit Parade. The CBC sent a VIA train on a nationwide tour for their 50th anniversary in 2002, complete with artifacts on loan from the CBC Museum.http://www.trainweb.com/travelogues/viarail/2002i25a.html#sthash.SLsyU4l8.dpbs =Staff redundancy, controversy= Museum curator Faye Blum and another employee were deemed \\"redundant\\" in 2007, leaving that October.Gayle MacDonald, \\"CBC says sorry after toying with Rusty and Jerome\\", The Globe and Mail, November 27, 2007, page A6. Blum assumed that the museum would be closing, and met with Richard Stursberg, head of CBC's English service. As the Canada Science and Technology Museum agreed to take the collection, and Blum asked for an extension to make sure the items were catalogued for their transfer. Stursberg denied the request, but assured Blum he'd oversee the process. Concerned, Blum contacted those loaning artifacts, offering their return. The family of The Friendly Giant actor Bob Homme agreed to let the museum continue its loan of Rusty and Jerome, puppets from the series. Later in October 2007, the CBC aired the 2007 Gemini Awards, which included a segment about a retirement home for children's television characters. Rusty and Jerome were used without the family's permission, contrary to their terms of loan.Bruce DeMara, \\"Giant no longer so friendly with CBC\\", Toronto Star, November 28, 2007, pages E1 and E6. Other characters in the comedy segment, about a retirement home for children's television characters, were other puppets were depicted having oral sex, smoking, and drinking.Gayle MacDonald, \\"Things are looking up, way up, for orphaned puppets: Rusty and Jerome will live happily ever -- after the CBC\\", The Globe and Mail, November 27, 2007, pages A1 and A11.\\"Homme family retrieves Friendly Giant puppets in skit spat\\", CBC Arts, November 28, 2017. The family contacted the CBC on November 2, and it was said that the employee newly responsible for the museum was unaware of loan agreements. A month after the segment aired, Richard and Ann Homme, children of the late Bob Homme, retrieved the puppets from the museum. A CBC spokesperson offer a non-apology apology, in part saying that they \\"regret that they feel any trust was breached.\\" They hinted at exhibiting them at an unspecified location. The castle wall and window that Friendly would lean over to talk to Jerome and Rusty, however, remained in the museum. =Closure= In 2017, in the wake of the Gemini Awards segment, the CBC noted on-going plans to redevelop the main floor of the Canadian Broadcasting Centre. They intended to \\"include displays, artifacts and information that will represent CBC's rich history, its programs and its people.\\" Toronto Star columnist Shawn Micallef noticed that \\"for years\\" before the closure, there were displays \\"falling apart\\" and broken monitors. The museum was named by the Toronto Star in 2011 as one of the \\"museums you never knew existed.\\" Little advanced warning was given of the closure, announced in an internal email to staff. Exhibits CBC Museum Collection * CBC War Effort was an interactive exhibit running from at least February to December 15, 1996, timed to coincide with larger plans for the network's 60th anniversary.

It was closed on statutory holidays. The facility was wheelchair accessible. On opening in 1994, the facility was open daily from 10 am to 3 pm, with guided tours at opening and 2:30 pm, and daily availability for school tours. As of 1996, the museum was open weekdays from 10 am to 4 pm. By 2001 or earlier, hours changed to weekdays, 9 am to 5 pm, Saturdays, noon to 4 pm. Saturdays continued until at least 2003.

Divisions  Italian Jews historically fell into four categories. #Italkim, Jews of the Italian rite who have resided in Italy since Roman times; see below. #Sephardi Jews, in particular Spanish and Portuguese Jews, i.e., Jews who arrived in Italy following their expulsion from the Iberian Peninsula. The Kingdom of Spain expelled Jews with the 1492 Alhambra Decree and the persecution of Jews and Muslims by Manuel I of Portugal lead to their forced conversion to Roman Catholicism in 1497. In addition, Jews were forced out of the Kingdom of Naples in 1533. These groups also include anusim, crypto-Jewish families who left Iberia in subsequent centuries and reverted to Judaism, as well as immigration by Sephardi families which had lived in the Eastern Mediterranean following expulsion from the Iberian Peninsula. #Ashkenazi Jews, Jews living mainly in Northern Italy. #The Jews of Asti, Fossano, and Moncalvo (\\"Appam\\"). These represent the Jews expelled from France beginning in 1182 subsequent to the Rhineland massacres after the First Crusade. Their liturgy is similar to that of the Ashkenazim, but contains some distinctive usages descended from the French Jews of the time of Rashi, particularly in the services for the High Holy Days. Historically these communities remained separate: in a given city there was often an \\"Italian synagogue\\" and a \\"Spanish synagogue\\", and occasionally a \\"German synagogue\\" as well. In many cases these have since amalgamated, but a given synagogue may have services of more than one rite. Today there are further categories: *The Jews of San Nicandro who are converts, descendants of the neofiti (anusim) of San Nicandro Garganico; *Persian Jews living in Rome and Milan; *Libyan Jews living in Rome and Livorno.  History  Italian Jews can be traced back as far as the 2nd century BCE: tombstones and dedicatory inscriptions survive from this period. At that time they mostly lived in the far South of Italy, with a branch community in Rome, and were generally Greek-speaking. It is thought that some families (for example the Adolescenti) are descendants of Jews deported from Judaea by the emperor Titus in 70 CE. In early medieval times there were major communities in southern Italian cities such as Bari and Otranto. Medieval Italian Jews also produced important halachic works such as the Shibbole ha- Le·∏≥e·π≠ of Zedekiah ben Abraham Anaw. Following the expulsion of the Jews from the Kingdom of Naples in 1533, the centre of gravity shifted to Rome and the north. Two of the most famous of Italy's Jews were Obadiah ben Jacob Sforno (1475-1550) and Moshe Chaim Luzzatto (1707‚Äì1746) whose written religious and ethical works are still widely studied. The Italian Jewish community as a whole has numbered no more than 50,000 since it was fully emancipated in 1870. During the Second Aliyah (between 1904 and 1914) many Italian Jews moved to Israel, and there is an Italian synagogue and cultural centre in Jerusalem. Around 7,700 Italian Jews were deported and murdered during the Holocaust.  Italian rite Jews  Jewish wedding in Venice, 1780 Mus√©e d'Art et d'Histoire du Juda√Øsme The Jews living in Italy since the Roman times, distinct from the Sephardim and the Ashkenazim, are sometimes referred to in the scholarly literature as Italkim (Hebrew for \\"Italians\\"; pl. of \\"italki\\", Middle Hebrew loanword from the Latin adjective \\"italicu(m)\\", meaning \\"Italic\\", \\"Latin\\", \\"Roman\\"; italkit is also used in Modern Hebrew as the language name \\"Italian\\"). They have traditionally spoken a variety of Judeo-Italian languages. The customs and religious rites of the Italian-rite Jews can be seen as a bridge between the Ashkenazi and Sephardic traditions, showing similarities to both; they are closer still to the customs of the Romaniote Jews from Greece. A subdivision is recognised between minhag Ben√® Rom√¨, practised in Rome, and minhag Italiani, practised in northern cities such as Turin, though the two rites are generally close. In matters of religious law, Italian-rite Jews generally follow the same rules as the Sephardim, in that they accept the authority of Isaac Alfasi and the Shulchan Aruch as opposed to the Ashkenazi customs codified by Moses Isserles (the Rema). However their liturgy is different from that of both these groups. One reason for this may be that Italy was the main centre of early Jewish printing, enabling Italian Jews to preserve their own traditions when most other communities had to opt for a standard \\"Sephardi\\" or \\"Ashkenazi\\" prayer-book. It is often claimed that the Italian prayer-book contains the last remnants of the Palestinian minhag, while both the Sephardi and, to a lesser extent, the Ashkenazi rites, reflect the Babylonian tradition. This claim is quite likely historically accurate, though it is difficult to verify textually as little liturgical material from the Land of Israel survives. Additionally, some Italian traditions reflect the Babylonian rite in a more archaic form, in much the same way as the prayer- book of the Yemenite Jews. Examples of old Babylonian traditions retained by the Italians but by no other group (including the Baladi-rite prayer of the Yemeni Jews) are the use of keter yitenu lach in the kedushah of all servicesIn the old manuscripts of the Italian rite, in Daniel Goldschmidt's print and in references in early literature such as Shibbole ha-Leket. Today's minhag ben√® Rom√¨ follows the Sephardic rite in using keter for musaf only and nakdishach for all other services. and of na·∏•amenu in Birkat Hamazon, the grace after meals on Shabbat, both of which are found in the siddur of Amram Gaon. The Italian rite community traditionally has used Italian Hebrew, a pronunciation system similar to that of conservative Iberian Jews. This pronunciation has in many cases been adopted by the Sephardi, Ashkenazi and Appam communities of Italy as well as by the Italian-rite communities. =Graeco-Italian Jews in Italy= The medieval pre-expulsion Jews of Southern Italy (the Jews of Apulia, Calabria, and Sicily) are often subsumed under the designation of \\"Italian Jews\\", and from a geographical point of view this is correct. In truth, however, Southern Italy, divided into the provinces of Sicily and the Catepanate of Italy, belonged to the Byzantine Empire till 1071, and remained culturally Greek well after that (see Griko people). Accordingly, the medieval Jewish communities of Southern Italy were linguistically a part of the Yevanic areaBernard Spolsky, The Languages of the Jews: A Sociolinguistic History. 2014 and as concerns customs and liturgy a part of the Romaniote area.R. Langer, Cursing the Christians?: A History of the Birkat HaMinim, p. 203. 2012 Even after the Byzantine Empire had lost the Southern Italian provinces, the Kehillot in Apulia, Calabria and Sicily maintained connections to their coreligionists in Greece and Constantinople.R. Bonfil et al., Jews in Byzantium: Dialectics of Minority and Majority Cultures, 2011Joshua Holo, Byzantine Jewry in the Mediterranean Economy. 2009 Nevertheless, Jews in rural areas of Emirate of Sicily and Apulia are known to have made some use of Judeo-Arabic and Judeo-Italian languages in addition to Greek.Metcalfe, A. Muslims and Christians in Norman Sicily: Arabic-Speakers and the End of Islam. 2014Safran, L. The Medieval Salento: Art and Identity in Southern Italy, p. 215. 2014  Ashkenazi Jews in Italy  There have been Ashkenazi Jews living in the North of Italy since at least as early as the late Middle Ages. In Venice, they were the oldest Jewish community in the city, antedating both the Sephardic and the Italian groups. Following the invention of printing Italy became a major publishing centre for Hebrew and Yiddish books for the use of German and other northern European Jews. A notable figure was Elijah Levita, who was an expert Hebrew grammarian and Masorete as well as the author of the Yiddish romantic epic Bovo-Bukh. Another distinctive community was that of Asti, Fossano and Moncalvo, which was descended from Jews expelled from France in 1394: this community includes the well-known Lattes family. Only the Asti synagogue is still in use today. Their rite, known as Appam (from the Hebrew initials for those three cities), is similar to the Ashkenazi, but has some peculiarities drawn from the old French rite, particularly on the High Holy Days. These variations are found on loose- leaf sheets which the community uses in conjunction with the normal Ashkenazi prayer-book; they are also printed by Goldschmidt.Daniel Goldschmidt, Me·∏•qare Tefillah u-Fiyyut (On Jewish Liturgy): Jerusalem 1978. This rite is the only surviving descendant of the original French rite, as known to Rashi, used anywhere in the world: French Ashkenazim since 1394 have used the German- Ashkenazic rite. In musical tradition and in pronunciation, Italian Ashkenazim differ considerably from the Ashkenazim of other countries, and show some assimilation to the other two communities. Exceptional are the north-eastern communities such as that of Gorizia, which date from Austro-Hungarian times and are much closer to the German and Austrian traditions. =Genetic connection between Ashkenazi Jews and Italians= A 2010 study on Jewish ancestry by Atzmon-Ostrer et al. stated \\"Two major groups were identified by principal component, phylogenetic, and identity by descent (IBD) analysis: Middle Eastern Jews and European/Syrian Jews. The IBD segment sharing and the proximity of European Jews to each other and to southern European populations suggested similar origins for European Jewry and refuted large-scale genetic contributions of Central and Eastern European and Slavic populations to the formation of Ashkenazi Jewry\\", as both groups ‚Äì the Middle Eastern Jews and European/Syrian Jews ‚Äì shared common ancestors in the Middle East about 2500 years ago. The study examines genetic markers spread across the entire genome and shows that the Jewish groups (Ashkenazi and non Ashkenazi) share large swaths of DNA, indicating close relationships and that each of the Jewish groups in the study (Iranian, Iraqi, Syrian, Italian, Turkish, Greek and Ashkenazi) has its own genetic signature but is more closely related to the other Jewish groups than to their fellow non-Jewish countrymen. Atzmon‚ÄìOstrer's team found that the SNP markers in genetic segments of 3 million DNA letters or longer were 10 times more likely to be identical among Jews than non-Jews. Results of the analysis also tally with biblical accounts of the fate of the Jews. The study also found that with respect to non-Jewish European groups, the population most closely related to Ashkenazi Jews are modern-day Italians. The study speculated that the genetic-similarity between Ashkenazi Jews and Italians may be due to inter-marriage and conversions in the time of the Roman Empire. It was also found that any two Ashkenazi Jewish participants in the study shared about as much DNA as fourth or fifth cousins. A study by Behar et al. (2013) found evidence in Ashkenazim of mixed European and Levantine origins. The authors found the greatest affinity and shared ancestry of Ashkenazi Jews to be (after that with other Jewish groups from southern Europe, Syria, and North Africa) with both Southern Europeans such as Italians and modern Levantines such as the Druze, Cypriots, Lebanese and Samaritans. In addition to finding no affinity in Ashkenazim with northern Caucasus populations, the authors found no more affinity in Ashkenazi Jews to modern south Caucasus and eastern Anatolian populations (such as Armenians, Azeris, Georgians, and Turks) than found in non-Ashkenazi Jews or non-Jewish Middle Easterners (such as Kurds, Iranians, Druze and Lebanese). A 2017 autosomal study by Xue, Shai Carmi et al. found an approximately even mixture of Middle-Eastern Levantine and European ancestry in Ashkenazi Jews, with the European component being largely of southern European origin with a minority being Eastern European, and the Middle Eastern ancestry showing the strongest affinity to Levantine populations such as the Druze and Lebanese.  Sephardi Jews in Italy  Since 1442, when the Kingdom of Naples came under Spanish rule, considerable numbers of Sephardi Jews came to live in Southern Italy. Following the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492, from Portugal in 1495 and from the Kingdom of Naples in 1533, many moved to central and northern Italy. One famous refugee was Isaac Abarbanel. Over the next few centuries they were joined by a steady stream of conversos leaving Spain and Portugal. In Italy they ran the risk of prosecution for Judaizing, given that in law they were baptized Christians; for this reason they generally avoided the Papal States. The Popes did allow some Spanish-Jewish settlement at Ancona, as this was the main port for the Turkey trade, in which their links with the Ottoman Sephardim were useful. Other states found it advantageous to allow the conversos to settle and mix with the existing Jewish communities, and to turn a blind eye to their religious status; while in the next generation, the children of conversos could be brought up as fully Jewish with no legal problem, as they had never been baptized. The main places of settlement were as follows. # Venice. The Venetian Republic often had strained relations with the Papacy; on the other hand they were alive to the commercial advantages offered by the presence of educated Spanish-speaking Jews, especially for the Turkey trade. Previously the Jews of Venice were tolerated under charters for a fixed term of years, periodically renewed. In the early 16th century these arrangements were made permanent, and a separate charter was granted to the \\"Ponentine\\" (western) community. The price paid for this recognition was the confinement of the Jews to the newly established Venetian Ghetto. Nevertheless, for a long time the Venetian Republic was regarded as the most welcoming state for Jews, equivalent to the Netherlands in the 17th century or the United States in the 20th century. # Sephardic immigration was also encouraged by the Este princes, in their possessions of Reggio, Modena and Ferrara (these cities also had established Italian-rite and Ashkenazi communities). In 1598, following the extinction of the male line of d'Este dukes of Ferrara, that city was repossessed by the Papal States, leading to some Jewish emigration from there (although overall the community survived as a distinct and significant entity up until the 20th century). # In 1593, Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, granted Portuguese Jews charters to live and trade in Pisa and Livorno (see Jewish community of Livorno). On the whole the Spanish and Portuguese Jews remained separate from the native Italian Jews, though there was considerable mutual religious and intellectual influence between the groups. The Scola Spagnola of Venice was originally regarded as the \\"mother synagogue\\" for the Spanish and Portuguese community worldwide, as it was among the earliest to be established, and the first prayer book was published there: later communities, such as Amsterdam, followed its lead on ritual questions. With the decline in the importance of Venice in the 18th century, the leading role passed to Livorno (for Italy and the Mediterranean) and Amsterdam (for western countries). The Livorno synagogue was destroyed in the Second World War: a modern building was erected in 1958-62. In addition to Spanish and Portuguese Jews strictly so called, Italy has been host to many Sephardi Jews from the eastern Mediterranean. Dalmatia and many of the Greek islands, where there were large Jewish communities, were for several centuries part of the Venetian Republic, and there was a \\"Levantine\\" community in Venice. This remained separate from the \\"Ponentine\\" (i.e. Spanish and Portuguese) community and close to their eastern roots, as evidenced by their use in the early 18th century of a hymn book classified by maqam in the Ottoman manner (see Pizmonim).Moshe Hacohen, Ne'im Zemirot Yisrael, BL Add 26967, cited Edwin Seroussi, \\"In Search of Jewish Musical Antiquity in the 18th-Century Venetian Ghetto: Reconsidering the Hebrew Melodies in Benedetto Marcello's Estro Poetico-Armonico\\", JQR (NS) vol 93 p 173. (Today both synagogues are still in use, but the communities have amalgamated.) Later on the community of Livorno acted as a link between the Spanish and Portuguese and the eastern Sephardic Jews and as a clearing house of musical and other traditions between the groups. Many Italian Jews today have \\"Levantine\\" roots, for example in Corfu, and before the Second World War Italy regarded the existence of the eastern Sephardic communities as a chance to expand Italian influence in the Mediterranean. In the 18th and 19th centuries, many Italian Jews (mostly but not exclusively from the Spanish and Portuguese group) maintained a trading and residential presence in both Italy and countries in the Ottoman Empire: even those who settled permanently in the Ottoman Empire retained their Tuscan or other Italian nationality, so as to have the benefit of the Ottoman Capitulations. Thus in Tunisia there was a community of Juifs Portugais, or L'Grana (Livornese), separate from, and regarding itself as superior to, the native Tunisian Jews (Tuansa). Smaller communities of the same kind existed in other countries, such as Syria, where they were known as Se√±ores Francos, though they generally were not numerous enough to establish their own synagogues, instead meeting for prayer in each other's houses. European countries often appointed Jews from these communities as their consular representatives in Ottoman cities. Between the two World Wars Libya was an Italian colony and, as in other North African countries, the colonial power found the local Jews useful as an educated elite. Following Libyan independence, and especially after the Six-Day War in 1967, many Libyan Jews left either for Israel or for Italy, and today most of the \\"Sephardi\\" synagogues in Rome are in fact Libyan.

It was also used to protect U.S. Air Force warplane airfields and U.S. Army helicopter airfields. The heart of the M167 was a variant of the M61 Vulcan 20√ó102 mm rapid-fire rotary cannon. It was also effective against lightly armored ground targets. The M167 gun has now been withdrawn from service by U.S. military units, but it might still be used by other countries. History Starting in 1994, the M167 was replaced in U.S. service by the M1097 Avenger missile launcher and in 2005, by a ground-based version of the Phalanx CIWS self-defense gun which the U.S. Navy uses on its ships.

The M167A2 VADS was modified with an improved fire-control subsystem. The improvement was obtained by replacing the disturbed reticle sight with a director reticle sight, the sight current generator with a digital processor, and the azimuth drive assembly with a harmonic drive. It also had an extra wheel put on each side which prevented flipping by providing a longer lever.

Biography  General de Rochambeau in Saint Domingue He served in the American Revolutionary War as an aide-de-camp to his father, spending the winter of 1781‚Äì1782 in quarters at Williamsburg, Virginia. In the 1790s, he participated in an unsuccessful campaign to re- establish French authority in Martinique and Saint-Domingue. Rochambeau was later assigned to the French Revolutionary Army in the Italian Peninsula, and was appointed to the military command of the Ligurian Republic. In 1802, he was appointed to lead an expeditionary force against Saint Domingue (Haiti) after General Charles Leclerc's death. His remit was to restore French control of their rebellious colony, by any means. Historians of the Haitian Revolution credit his brutal tactics for uniting black and gens de couleur soldiers against the French. After Rochambeau surrendered to the rebel general Jean- Jacques Dessalines in November 1803, the former French colony declared its independence as Ha√Øti, the second independent state in the Americas. In the process, Dessalines became arguably the most successful military commander in the struggle against Napoleonic France.Christer Petley, White Fury: A Jamaican Slaveholder and the Age of REvolution (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018), p. 182. At the surrender of Cap Fran√ßais, Rochambeau was captured aboard the frigate Surveillante by a British squadron under the command of Captain John Loring and returned to England as a prisoner on parole, where he remained interned for almost nine years. He was exchanged in 1811, and returned to the family ch√¢teau, where he resumed the work of classifying the family's growing collection of maps, which his father had begun. He also enriched the collections with new acquisitions, in particular ones contributed by the military campaigns of his son, Auguste-Philippe Donatien de Vimeur, who served as the aide-de-camp for Joachim Murat and was with Murat's cavalry in the Russian campaign in 1812. He was mortally wounded in the Battle of Nations, and died three days later at Leipzig, at the age of 58. In addition to his legitimate son, Vimeur was survived by an illegitimate son, Lewis Warrington, conceived in Williamsburg, Virginia, when Vimeur was a young officer serving with his father in America during the Revolutionary War.

It lies 18 km south-west of Quimper by road. Geography Penmarch is the southwest most township of Pays Bigouden, at the southern end of the Bay of Audierne. It is the most populous township of the Guilvinec's canton, with a population of 5,889 inhabitants in 1999 (21,813 for the entire township). The territory of the town is particularly flat and a very low altitude. There are many marshy lagoons, some of which have been drained and filled, especially in St. Gu√©nol√© to save space or habitat for the installation of local handicrafts. The municipality consists of four villages: * Penmarch-Bourg, formerly known as the Tr√©oultr√©; * Saint Gu√©nol√© (main fishing port); * Kerity (fishing port side moving towards the hosting of the craft); * St. Pierre (port for very small units). Many islands or reefs of very variable dimensions punctuate the coast of Penmarch; the most important are the Etocs south of Kerity, and the island St. Nonna west of Saint-Pierre. The port of Saint-Gu√©nol√© has a pass opening due west, thought to be dangerous in rough weather. It is protected by two granite peninsulas: Krugen in the South, and Conq in the northwest. Krugen is connected to the mainland by a sandy isthmus. Conq is connected to shore by an artificial embankment itself protected by concrete blocks to better break the flood wave. The rocky granite coast (called \\"savage coast\\" in St. Gu√©nol√©) is interspersed with several beaches: * North, the beach of Pors Carn-which extends to the tip of the torch (joint Plomeur); * West, the beach of Joy; * South, the beach Steir Kerity which begins and continues through Guilvinec. History St Nonna's Church, Penmarch On the extremity of the peninsula on which it is situated are fortified remains of a town which was of considerable importance from the 14th to the 16th centuries and included, besides Penmarc'h, Saint-Gu√©nol√© and Kerity. It owed its prosperity to its cod-banks, the disappearance of which, together with the discovery of the Newfoundland cod-banks and the pillage of the place by the bandit La Fontenelle in 1595, contributed to its decline. The church of Saint Nouna, a Gothic building of the early 16th century at Penmarc'h, and the church of St. Gu√©nol√©, an unfinished tower, and the church of Kerity are of interest. The coast is very dangerous. On the Pointe de Penmarc'h stands the Phare d'Eckm√ºhl, with a light visible for . There are numerous megalithic monuments in the vicinity. Climate Penmarch has a climate bordering between mediterranean (K√∂ppen Csb) and oceanic (Cfb). It is heavily moderated by the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf Stream influence, resulting in cool summers and very mild winters for the latitude as seasonal differences are low. Population Inhabitants of Penmarc'h are called in French Penmarchais. The commune has a greater population than Guilvinec. Sights Penmarch is also home to the 'Droguen' rock.

Built in 1887, it is one of the first synagogues erected in the United States by Eastern European Jews. The Orthodox congregation that constructed the synagogue moved into the downstairs beth midrash in the 1950s, and the main sanctuary was unused until the 1980s, when it was restored to become the Museum at Eldridge Street. History Interior in 2018 The Eldridge Street Synagogue is one of the first synagogues erected in the United States by Eastern European Jews (Ashkenazim). One of the founders was Rabbi Eliahu the Blessed (Borok), formerly the Head Rabbi of St. Petersburg, Russia. It opened in 1887 at 12 Eldridge Street in New York's Lower East Side, serving Congregation Kahal Adath Jeshurun. The building was designed by the architects Peter and Francis William Herter. The brothers subsequently received many commissions in the Lower East Side and incorporated elements from the synagogue, such as the stars of David, in their buildings, mainly tenements. When completed, the synagogue was reviewed in the local press. Writers marveled at the imposing Moorish Revival building, with its 70-foot-high dome and barrel vaulted ceiling, magnificent stained-glass rose windows, elaborate brass fixtures and hand-stenciled walls. As many as 800 families were members of the synagogue in its heyday, from its opening through 1920, and its sanctuary had a seating capacity of 1,000; Bittner, David (August 12, 1993). \\"Our Great-Grandfather's Synagogue: Eldridge Street Synagogue ‚Äì 107 years old ‚Äì is looking for a rebirth.\\" Jewish Journal (Deerfield Beach, Florida). p. 1B.

Before the settlement houses were established and long afterward, poor people could come to be fed, secure a loan, learn about job and housing opportunities, and make arrangements to care for the sick and the dying. The synagogue was, in this sense, a mutual aid society. For fifty years, the synagogue flourished. Then membership began to dwindle as members moved to other areas, immigration quotas limited the number of new arrivals, and the Great Depression affected the congregants' fortunes. The exquisite main sanctuary was used less and less from the 1930s on. By the 1950s, with the rain leaking in and inner stairs unsound, the congregants cordoned off the sanctuary. Without the resources needed to heat and maintain the sanctuary, they chose to worship downstairs in the more intimate beth midrash (study hall). The main sanctuary remained empty for twenty-five years, from approximately 1955 to 1980. In 1986 the non- sectarian, not-for-profit Eldridge Street Project was founded to restore the synagogue and renew it with educational and cultural programs. Paul P. E. Bookson, a former State Senator and Civil Court Justice, was instrumental in maintaining the Orthodox Religious services at the Eldridge Street Synagogue and its building restoration. After his death in 2005, his widow, Mrs. Tova G. Bookson, continued to worship there. At the beginning of the restoration work, in 1989, a skeleton was found in the basement of the synagogue. Renovation and reopening On December 2, 2007, after 20 years of renovation work that cost US$20 million, the Eldridge Street Project completed the restoration and opened to the public as the Museum at Eldridge Street, reflecting its cultural and educational mission, within the synagogue building. The museum offers informative tours that relate to American Jewish history, the history of the Lower East Side and immigration. Occasionally, Jewish religious events are celebrated there, though not in the former main sanctuary.Historic New York synagogue celebrates $20M restoration - Haaretz - Israel News The effort to return the sanctuary to its Victorian splendor, while maintaining the idiosyncrasies of the original aesthetic and preserving patina of age, included plaster consolidation and replication of ornamental plaster elements, over-paint removal, conservation, in-painting replication of stenciling, wood finishing and decorative painting including: faux-woodgraining, marbleizing, and gilding by skilled craftsmen.Cole, Diane, \\"Joy on Eldridge Street\\", Preservation Magazine Volume 60, Number 2, March / April 2008, p. 56.

It can be viewed as a common generalization of group cohomology and an ordinary cohomology theory. Specifically, the equivariant cohomology ring of a space X with action of a topological group G is defined as the ordinary cohomology ring with coefficient ring \\\\Lambda of the homotopy quotient EG \\\\times_G X: :H_G^*(X; \\\\Lambda) = H^*(EG \\\\times_G X; \\\\Lambda). If G is the trivial group, this is the ordinary cohomology ring of X, whereas if X is contractible, it reduces to the cohomology ring of the classifying space BG (that is, the group cohomology of G when G is finite.) If G acts freely on X, then the canonical map EG \\\\times_G X \\\\to X/G is a homotopy equivalence and so one gets: H_G^*(X; \\\\Lambda) = H^*(X/G; \\\\Lambda). It is also possible to define the equivariant cohomology H_G^*(X;A) of X with coefficients in a G-module A; these are abelian groups. This construction is the analogue of cohomology with local coefficients. If X is a manifold, G a compact Lie group and \\\\Lambda is the field of real numbers or the field of complex numbers (the most typical situation), then the above cohomology may be computed using the so-called Cartan model (see equivariant differential forms.) The construction should not be confused with other cohomology theories, such as Bredon cohomology or the cohomology of invariant differential forms: if G is a compact Lie group, then, by the averaging argument, any form may be made invariant; thus, cohomology of invariant differential forms does not yield new information. Koszul duality is known to hold between equivariant cohomology and ordinary cohomology.  Homotopy quotient  The homotopy quotient, also called homotopy orbit space or Borel construction, is a ‚Äúhomotopically correct‚Äù version of the orbit space (the quotient of X by its G-action) in which X is first replaced by a larger but homotopy equivalent space so that the action is guaranteed to be free. To this end, construct the universal bundle EG ‚Üí BG for G and recall that EG admits a free G-action. Then the product EG √ó X ‚Äîwhich is homotopy equivalent to X since EG is contractible‚Äîadmits a ‚Äúdiagonal‚Äù G-action defined by (e,x).g = (eg,g‚àí1x): moreover, this diagonal action is free since it is free on EG. So we define the homotopy quotient XG to be the orbit space (EG √ó X)/G of this free G-action. In other words, the homotopy quotient is the associated X-bundle over BG obtained from the action of G on a space X and the principal bundle EG ‚Üí BG. This bundle X ‚Üí XG ‚Üí BG is called the Borel fibration.  An example of a homotopy quotient  The following example is Proposition 1 of . Let X be a complex projective algebraic curve. We identify X as a topological space with the set of the complex points X(\\\\mathbb{C}), which is a compact Riemann surface. Let G be a complex simply connected semisimple Lie group. Then any principal G-bundle on X is isomorphic to a trivial bundle, since the classifying space BG is 2-connected and X has real dimension 2. Fix some smooth G-bundle P_\\\\text{sm} on X. Then any principal G-bundle on X is isomorphic to P_\\\\text{sm}. In other words, the set \\\\Omega of all isomorphism classes of pairs consisting of a principal G-bundle on X and a complex- analytic structure on it can be identified with the set of complex-analytic structures on P_\\\\text{sm} or equivalently the set of holomorphic connections on X (since connections are integrable for dimension reason). \\\\Omega is an infinite-dimensional complex affine space and is therefore contractible. Let \\\\mathcal{G} be the group of all automorphisms of P_\\\\text{sm} (i.e., gauge group.) Then the homotopy quotient of \\\\Omega by \\\\mathcal{G} classifies complex-analytic (or equivalently algebraic) principal G-bundles on X; i.e., it is precisely the classifying space B\\\\mathcal{G} of the discrete group \\\\mathcal{G}. One can define the moduli stack of principal bundles \\\\operatorname{Bun}_G(X) as the quotient stack [\\\\Omega/\\\\mathcal{G}] and then the homotopy quotient B\\\\mathcal{G} is, by definition, the homotopy type of \\\\operatorname{Bun}_G(X).  Equivariant characteristic classes  Let E be an equivariant vector bundle on a G-manifold M. It gives rise to a vector bundle \\\\widetilde{E} on the homotopy quotient EG \\\\times_G M so that it pulls-back to the bundle \\\\widetilde{E}=EG \\\\times E over EG \\\\times M. An equivariant characteristic class of E is then an ordinary characteristic class of \\\\widetilde{E}, which is an element of the completion of the cohomology ring H^*(EG \\\\times_G M) = H^*_G(M). (In order to apply Chern‚ÄìWeil theory, one uses a finite-dimensional approximation of EG.) Alternatively, one can first define an equivariant Chern class and then define other characteristic classes as invariant polynomials of Chern classes as in the ordinary case; for example, the equivariant Todd class of an equivariant line bundle is the Todd function evaluated at the equivariant first Chern class of the bundle. (An equivariant Todd class of a line bundle is a power series (not a polynomial as in the non- equivariant case) in the equivariant first Chern class; hence, it belongs to the completion of the equivariant cohomology ring.) In the non-equivariant case, the first Chern class can be viewed as a bijection between the set of all isomorphism classes of complex line bundles on a manifold M and H^2(M; \\\\mathbb{Z}).using ƒåech cohomology and the isomorphism H^1(M; \\\\mathbb{C}^*) \\\\simeq H^2(M; \\\\mathbb{Z}) given by the exponential map. In the equivariant case, this translates to: the equivariant first Chern gives a bijection between the set of all isomorphism classes of equivariant complex line bundles and H^2_G(M; \\\\mathbb{Z}).

This tribal household dominated district was formed in the year 1956. Rudyard Kipling used the forests in the vicinity of Seoni, or as was spelled during British colonial rule, Seeonee, as the setting for the Mowgli stories in The Jungle Book and The Second Jungle Book (1894‚Äì1895), although the area is not an actual rainforest. Seoni is city where tributary of the river Godavari, the Wainganga, originates. Seoni is reachable by road, major adjacent cities Nagpur and Jabalpur. The National Highway 44 north‚Äìsouth corridor crosses from Seoni. The nearest airport is in Nagpur (130 km); a small airport (air-strip) is available at Seoni near Sukhtara village for landing charter aeroplanes/helicopters. Geography Seoni is located at .Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Seoni It has an average elevation of 611 metres (2005 feet). The city is 2,005 ft. above sea level, halfway between Nagpur and Jabalpur. , the city had a population of 1,379,131. It was founded in 1774, and contains large public gardens, a market place and a tank dalsagar. It has 37% forest cover. The Seoni district is located in the southern part of Madhya Pradesh. Geographically the district extends over an area of 8758 km2. It is bordered by Jabalpur, Narsinghpur and Mandla districts to the north, Balaghat to the east and Chhindwara to the west and the shares its southern boundary with Nagpur (Maharashtra). National Highway No. 44 is longest of India connects the Kanyakumari-Banaras passes through the district from north to south. Fair weather roads connect the major towns in the district.

Tourist attractions =Pench Tiger Reserve= The River Bainganga's source is located beneath the village Mundara, where it includes for example the Pench Tiger Reserve within 10 km. The Pench Tiger Reserve is named after the Pench River, which flows from north to south through the reserve, and is located in the southern reaches of the Satpura hill ranges in the Seoni and Chhindwara districts in the Madhya Pradesh state of India. The terrain is undulating, with most of the area covered by small hill ranges, steeply sloping on the sides. The Pench National Park is named after the Pench River, which flows from north to south through the park. This river constitutes the district boundary of Seoni and Chhindwara districts of Madhya Pradesh in the upper region and State boundary with Maharashtra State in the lower region. This area became the 19th tiger reserve of India in 1992. The tourist traffic is experiencing fast growth in this park.Pench The Pench National Park which constitutes the core of the tiger reserves was notified in the year 1983. The total area of the park is 292.85 km2. The total area of the Pench Tiger Reserve is 757.85 km2. The reserve is situated in an area that holds a significant place in the natural history of Central India. Descriptions of its flora and fauna have appeared in wildlife books dating back to the 17th century. Books written in the 19th and early 20th century by naturalists like Captain J. Forsyth and Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Book cover the panorama of nature's abundance in this tract. A forest belt extends in three directions: north, east and south, covering forest tracts of Seoni, Balaghat and Nagpur districts. The contiguous forest on the southern side in the Maharashtra state of India, initially named Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru National Park has been recently included in the Project Tiger network under the same name as this reserve. A dam was constructed on the Pench River on south-eastern boundary of the reserve. The area is criss-crossed by numerous seasonal streams and \\"nalas\\". The Pench River flowing through the central line of the reserve is dry by the end of April but a number of water pools locally known locally as \\"dohs\\" are found, which serve as waterholes for wild animals. A few perennial springs also exist in this area. However, the water sources are not suitably distributed, hence large area remains unused by the wild animals. The Pench reservoir at the center of the reserve is the only major water source during pinch period. As the prey concentration is high along the Pench River, tigers usually inhabit this belt. Leopards, though, generally operate in the peripheral areas but are occasionally seen in deep forests also. Jungle cats are commonly seen. Leopard cats, small Indian civet and palm civet are common but seen very rarely. Wild dogs are commonly seen in packs of 12 to 15, near Chhedia, Jamtara, Bodanala and Pyorthadi areas of the reserve. Wild boars are ubiquitous. Sloth bears occupy the hilly, rocky outcrops and favour mahul bel-infested forest. Chinkara are present in very small numbers and are found in open areas around Turia, Telia, and Dudhgaon villages. Jackals are seen occasionally near Tekadi, Alikatta and Chhindimatta villages. =Pench Jungle Camp Pench Tiger Reserve= A resort with wooden huts and rustic appeal, that has been designed to create an experience of living in nature, with nature!

Slaughter is an experienced author and editor, having worked on eight books, including A New World Order (2004); The Idea That Is America: Keeping Faith with Our Values in a Dangerous World (2007); Unfinished Business: Women, Men, Work, Family (2015); her latest work The Chessboard and the Web: Strategies of Connection in a Dangerous World (2017), and countless scholarly articles. She revived a national debate over gender equality in the 21st century in an article in The Atlantic titled \\"Why Women Still Can‚Äôt Have it All\\". It addressed the difficulties women still face in finding a balance between a fulfilling career and family life.Poo, Ai-jen. \\"Caring without question- Unfinished business: Women, Men, Work, Family. By Anne-Marie Slaughter. Ney York: random House, 2015.\\" Signs: Journal of Women in Culture ad Society, vol. 42, no. 2, 2017, pp. 558‚Äì560. University of Chicago Press, doi:10.1086/688266. Slaughter is on the Global Advisory Board for Oxford University's journal on \\"Global Summitry: Politics, Economics, and Law in International Governance.\\" Early life, family and honors Slaughter was born and raised in Charlottesville, Virginia, the daughter of a Belgian mother, Anne Marie Denise Limbosch, and an American father, Edward Ratliff Slaughter Jr., a lawyer. Her paternal grandfather was Edward Slaughter, a football player, athletic coach, and professor of physical education. Anne- Marie Slaughter, who once went by Anne-Marie Burley, was a matron of honor at Jeffrey Toobin's wedding. She is married to Princeton politics professor Andrew Moravcsik, with whom she has two children: Alex and Michael MoravcsikPrinceton Weekly Bulletin, April 30, 2007 p.1-7 Slaughter is a 1976 graduate of St. Anne's-Belfield School in Charlottesville, Virginia. She graduated magna cum laude with an A.B. from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University in 1980, where she also received a certificate in European Cultural Studies. As part of her undergraduate degree, she completed a 138-page long senior thesis titled \\"Creativity and Change: The Cultural Opposition and Soviet Reform: Implications for United States Human Rights Policy.\\" Mentored by Richard H. Ullman, she won the Daniel M. Sachs Memorial Scholarship, one of Princeton's top honors, which provides for two years of study at Worcester College, Oxford.Fellowship in memory of Rhodes Scholar from Princeton who studied at Worcester College, Oxford, Daniel M. Sachs. Princeton.edu. After receiving her M.Phil. in International Affairs from Oxford in 1982, she studied at Harvard Law School and graduated cum laude with a J.D. in 1985. She continued at Harvard after graduation as a researcher for her academic mentor, the international lawyer Abram Chayes. In 1992, she received her D.Phil. in International Relations from Oxford. Slaughter has received an honorary degree from the University of Miami in 2006, the University of Virginia's Thomas Jefferson Medal in 2007, the University of Warwick in 2013, and Tufts University in 2014; she was the Commencement speaker that year at Tufts. She is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Academic career =Scholarship and teaching= Slaughter served on the faculty of the University of Chicago Law School from 1989‚Äì1994 and then as J. Sinclair Armstrong Professor of International, Foreign, and Comparative Law on the faculty of Harvard Law School from 1994 to 2002. She then moved to Princeton to serve as dean of the Woodrow Wilson School, the first woman to hold that position. She held that post from 2002 to 2009, when she accepted an appointment at the US State Department. During the academic year 2007‚Äì2008, Slaughter was a visiting fellow at the Shanghai Institute for International Affairs. In 2011, she returned to Princeton as a professor. As a scholar, Slaughter has had a focus on integrating the study of international relations and international law, using international relations theory in international legal theory. In addition, she has written extensively on European Union politics, network theories of world politics, transjudicial communication, liberal theories of international law and international relations, American foreign policy, international law, and various types of policy analysis. She has written books: International Law and International Relations (2000), A New World Order (2004), The Idea that is America: Keeping Faith with our Values in a Dangerous World (2007), and The Crisis of American Foreign Policy: Wilsonianism in the Twenty-first Century (with G. John Ikenberry, Thomas J. Knock, and Tony Smith) (2008), as well as three edited volumes on international relations and international law, and over one hundred extended articles in scholarly and policy journals or books. At Princeton University, she holds joint appointments with the Politics Department and the Woodrow Wilson School, where she teaches and advises PhD, Masters and undergraduate students. =Administration= Slaughter was Director of the International Legal Studies Program at Harvard Law School from 1994‚Äì2002, and a Professor at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government from 2001‚Äì2002. During her tenure as dean of the Woodrow Wilson School, she was credited with vigorously building the faculty, research and teaching activities of the school. She expanded the school by 30%, adding scholars from history, sociology, engineering and the natural sciences, and expanded the School's Masters in Public Policy Program to include medical doctors, lawyers, and Ph.D. scientists. She was credited with rebuilding Princeton's international relations faculty, including hiring a bevy of well-respected senior scholars including Robert Keohane, Helen Milner, and G. John Ikenberry. She also retained or hired influential right- of-center scholars including Aaron Friedberg and Thomas Christensen. Slaughter was responsible for the creation of several research centers in international political economy and national security, the joint Ph.D. program in Social Policy, the Global Fellows program, and the Scholars in the Nation's Service Initiative. In late 2005, over 100 Princeton students and faculty signed an open letter to Slaughter and Princeton president Shirley Tilghman criticizing the University in general and the Woodrow Wilson School in particular of biasing selection of invited speakers in favor of those supportive of the George W. Bush administration. Slaughter responded to these claims by pointing to the dozens of public lectures by independent academics, journalists, and other analysts that the Wilson School hosts each academic year. Others noted that, with Bush's Republican Party controlling the Presidency and both houses of Congress, many of the most influential people in the federal government, and in the international relations apparatus in particular, were necessarily administration supporters. In 2003 the Woodrow Wilson School hosted an art exhibit titled \\"Ricanstructions\\" that opponents of the exhibit claimed was \\"offensive to Catholics\\" and desecrated Christian symbols. Slaughter defended the exhibit. From 2002 to 2004, Slaughter served as president of the American Society of International Law. She was also one of the early members on the Centre for International Governance Innovation international board of directors. Career at the State Department On 23 January 2009, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced the appointment of Slaughter as the new Director of Policy Planning under the Obama administration. Slaughter was the first woman to hold this position. At the State Department, Slaughter was chief architect of the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review whose first iteration was released in December 2010. The QDDR provided a blueprint for elevating development as a pillar of American foreign policy and leading through civilian power. Commenting upon the skepticism that often greets such reports, and reiterating Secretary Clinton's strong desire that the QDDR become an essential part of the State Department policy process, Slaughter said: \\"I'm pretty sure you're thinking, 'I've heard this before,' [a big plan to change the way a government agency works] But this is different.\\" Slaughter received the Secretary's Distinguished Service Award for exceptional leadership and professional competence, the highest honor conferred by the State Department. She also received a Meritorious Honor Award from the U.S. Agency for International Development for her outstanding contribution to development policy. In February 2011, at the conclusion of her two-year public service leave, Slaughter returned to Princeton University. She remains a consultant for the State Department and sits on the Secretary of State's Foreign Policy Advisory Board. She has written that she came \\"home not only because of Princeton's rules (after two years of leave, you lose your tenure), but also because of my desire to be with my family and my conclusion that juggling high-level government work with the needs of two teenage boys was not possible.\\" A 2015 article in Marie Claire magazine quoted Hillary Clinton as saying that \\"other women don't break a sweat\\" and choose to stay working in stressful government jobs. Since the article discussed Anne-Marie Slaughter in the same paragraph, Slaughter mentioned that she was \\"devastated\\" by the idea that Clinton had been referring to her specifically. After hearing confirmation from Clinton that the quotation was taken out of context, Slaughter stated that the two women were still on good terms. Other policy, public, and corporate activities In the 1980s, as a student, Slaughter was part of the team headed by Professor Abram Chayes that helped the Sandinista government of Nicaragua bring suit against the United States in the International Court of Justice for violations of international law, in the case Nicaragua v. United States (1986). Since leaving the State Department, Slaughter remains a frequent commentator on foreign policy issues by publishing op-eds in major newspapers, magazines and blogs and curating foreign policy news on Twitter. She appears regularly on CNN, BBC, NPR, and PBS and lectures to academic, civic, and corporate audiences. She has written a regular opinion column for Project Syndicate since January 2012. She delivers more than 60 public lectures annually. Foreign Policy magazine named her to their annual list of the Top100 Global Thinkers in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012. She has served on the boards of numerous non-profit organizations, including the Council of Foreign Relations, the New America Foundation, the National Endowment for Democracy, the National Security Network and the Brookings Doha Center. She is a member of the Advisory Board of the Center for New American Security, the Truman Project, and the bipartisan Development Council of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. In 2006, she chaired the Secretary of State's Advisory Committee on Democracy Promotion. From 2004‚Äì2007, she was a co-director of the Princeton Project on National Security. In the private sector, she started her law career at the corporate firm Simpson Thacher and is currently on the corporate board of Abt Associates, a for-profit government contractor involved in research, evaluation and implementing programs in the fields of health, social and environmental policy, and international development. She was previously on the board of the McDonald's Corporation and that of the Citigroup Economic and Political Strategies Advisory Group. In 2013, Slaughter was named president and CEO of the New America Foundation, a think-tank based in Washington, D.C. dedicated to renewing America in the Digital Age. Their \\"Better Life Lab\\" key projects and initiatives include Family Policy and Caregiving, Redesigning Work and Gender Equality, a topic Slaughter has been outspoken about in several of her writings.\\"Better Life Lab.\\" New America, www.newamerica.org/better-life-lab/. Accessed 27 September 2017. =On the responsibility to protect= In July 2005, Slaughter wrote in the American Journal of International Law about the responsibility to protect (R2P) that:Charles H. Camp and Theresa B. Bowman: \\"The Responsibility to Protect: Reading Ethical Responsibilities Into the Rule of Law\\", 20 March 2014 In her 2006 Levine lecture at Fordham University, Slaughter called the R2P \\"the most important shift in our conception of sovereignty since the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648,\\" and founded it in the Four Freedoms speech by President Roosevelt.lawnet.fordham.edu: \\"A New U.N. For a New Century\\", FLR (2006) 74(6) 2961 She referred to a speech by Kofi Annan, in which he saw that the United Nations had come to a \\"fork in the road\\" and in her words \\"that it was time to decide how to adapt the institution to not the world of 1945 but the world of 2005\\".nytimes.com: \\"THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ; In Annan and Chirac's Words: 'Fork in the Road' and 'Call a Summit'\\", 24 September 2003 =On Libyan intervention= United Nations Security Council Resolution 1970 and United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973, on the situation in Libya, were adopted on 26 February and 17 March 2011, respectively. Resolution 1970 was the first case where the Security Council authorized a military intervention citing the R2P; it passed unanimously. One week after the adoption with many absentions of the latter Resolution, Slaughter wrote a strong endorsement of Western military intervention in Libya.ft.com: \\"Why Libya sceptics were proved badly wrong\\", 24 August 2011 In this op-ed, Slaughter challenged the skeptics who questioned the NATO use of force in Libya, describing a lack of NATO as an invitation for other regional regimes to increase their repression to remain in power. She challenged the idea that value-based and interest-based arguments on intervention could be distinguished and noted the role of President Barack Obama in helping to form an international coalition, which increased the pressure on Muammar Gadhafi. She is supportive of the Libyan Transitional National Council draft constitutional charter and is relieved that comparisons with Iraq are being made, because it might prevent similar mistakes in Libya. On 25 August 2011, she was roundly criticized by Matt Welch, who sorted through many of Slaughter's prior op-eds and concluded that she was a \\"situational constitutionalist\\".reason.com: \\"Anne-Marie Slaughter's End Zone Dancing and Situational Constitutionalism\\", 25 August 2011 Clifford May on 15 October 2014 wrote a piece in which he drew a straight line between Annan and Slaughter's R2P \\"norm\\", and the failure in Libya. May noted that President Obama had cited the R2P norm as his primary justification for using military force with Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi, who had threatened to attack the opposition stronghold of Benghazi.townhall.com: \\"The Demise of ‚ÄòResponsibility to Protect‚Äô at The U.N.\\", 15 October 2014 On 26 February 2015, Forbes magazine published a piece by Doug Bandow which called for Washington policymakers to be held accountable for another war gone bad. Slaughter was singled out for criticism, for her statement that \\"it clearly can be in the U.S. and the West‚Äôs strategic interest to help social revolutions fighting for the values we espouse and proclaim.\\":forbes.com: \\"Libya: Hold Policymakers Accountable For Another Washington War Gone Bad\\", 26 February 2015 =On Syrian intervention= In a February 2012 op-ed for The New York Times, Slaughter wrote proposing the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad by means of civil disobedience: She proposed that actors such as Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Jordan, \\"arm the opposition soldiers with anti-tank, countersniper and portable antiaircraft weapons\\" in order to help the Friends of Syria group intervene. Journalist Michael Hirsh was quick to support her in the National Journal, writing that \\"even if the U.N. Security Council remains paralyzed, the newly empowered Arab League can provide a cover of legitimacy.\\"nationaljournal.com: \\"ANALYSIS - Getting Serious About Syria\\", 24 Feb 2012 On 8 June 2012, Slaughter returned to the subject of intervention in Syria, with a rebuttal of a Henry Kissinger piece,washingtonpost.com: \\"Syrian intervention risks upsetting global order\\", 1 Jun 2012 in which he argued that an intervention would imperil the foundation of world order. Citing two situation reports and claiming that NATO had violated UNSC 1970 in Libya, Slaughter imagined an intervention process without widespread destruction:washingtonpost.com: \\"Syrian intervention is justifiable, and just\\", 8 Jun 2012 Slaughter sought to provide arms to the rebels, calling for bold action in creating a western backed coalition that would provide heavy weapons to rebels that controlled safe zones which admitted foreign journalists to monitor the rebels' actions. She imagined that \\"this type of action would force the Russian and Chinese governments to come clean about the real motives for their positions,\\" and proceeded to charge Vladimir Putin with \\"crimes against humanity, indeed near-genocide... in Chechnya at the turn of the century\\". Slaughter admitted that the principle of sovereignty was \\"enshrined in the United Nations Charter,\\" but pointed to the fact that in 2005, the doctrine of R2P had been adopted by the UN. =On how gender impacts work-family balance= Slaughter's article titled \\"Why Women Still Can't Have it All\\" appeared in the July/August 2012 issue of The Atlantic. In the first four days after publication, the piece attracted 725,000 unique readers, making it the most popular article ever published in that magazine. In the same period, it received over 119,000 Facebook \\"Recommends,\\" making it by far the most \\"liked\\" piece ever to appear in any version of the magazine. Within several days, it had been discussed in detail on the front page of The New York Times and in many other media outlets, attracting attention from around the world. Although Slaughter originally tried to call the article \\"Why Women Can't Have it All Yet,\\" she has since stated that it was a mistake to use the phrase \\"Have it All\\" in general. In 2015, Slaughter clarified that she hoped to stimulate a discussion about a wide range of working mothers, not only those in prestigious or lucrative careers. The article in The Atlantic became the basis of the 2015 book Unfinished Business: Women Men Work Family. The book argues that a number of challenges remain for the women's movement in the US. It allows her to expands on her position in the article and respond to her critics. In Unfinished Business, she attempts to create a framework to understand the problems faced by all working parents, not just women. She also discusses US public policy and declares that without paid maternity leave, affordable childcare, the right to part-time work, job security for pregnant employees and better enforcement of discriminatory laws both men and women will continue to suffer.Williams, Joan C. \\"Look how Far We‚Äôve Come (Not)Unfinished Business: Women, Men, Work, Family. by Anne-Marie Slaughter. New York: Random House, 2015.\\" Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society, vol. 42, no. 2, 2017, pp. 561-563. Slaughter urges a focus on the value of work being done, not on the traditional gender roles. She states that western notions of masculinity should be challenged before women imprison men to the crippling gender roles women have been fighting to escape from. Slaughter believes that men and women must acknowledge the damaging social system in place hindering their ability to make money while simultaneously caring for their families. When this system is realized they must work together to push the boundaries of traditional gender roles and create an impactful, positive change.Slaughter, Anne-Marie. \\"A Response.\\" Signs, vol. 42, no. 2, 2017, pp. 563. Ultimately, Slaughter calls for a change in the workplace policies which affect both men and women. She argues that embracing a parental role, instead of a gendered one is crucial for the success of future families. One step toward gender equity that it advocates is empowering men to re-envision their lives and embrace the roles of engaged fathers, sons and caregivers. =President and CEO of New America= Slaughter was named President and CEO of the think-tank New America in 2013. In 2017, The New York Times alleged that Slaughter had closed the Open Markets research group and dismissed its director Barry Lynn because he had criticized Google, a major donor of New America, and called for it to be broken up. Slaughter denied that Open Markets was closed because of pressure from Google and said Lynn was dismissed because he had \\"repeatedly violated the standards of honesty and good faith with his colleagues.\\" New America co-chair Jonathan Soros wrote in a letter that Google had neither \\"attempted to interfere\\" nor \\"threaten[ed] funding\\" over Open Markets research critical of monopolies. In a letter to New America's board and leadership, 25 former and current New America fellows said that although they had \\"never experienced any efforts by donors or managers at New America to influence [their] work,\\" they \\"were troubled by the initial lack of transparency and communication from New America's leadership\\" and \\"remained deeply concerned about this sequence of events\\".

Born in Toronto in 1951, she became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2009. She was previously Dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Science at Princeton University. Biography Klawe was born in Toronto, Ontario. She lived in Scotland from ages 4 to 12, and then returned to Canada, living with her family in Edmonton, Alberta.. Klawe studied at the University of Alberta, dropped out to travel the world, and returned to earn her B.Sc. in 1973. She stayed at Alberta for her graduate studies, and in 1977 she earned her Ph.D. there in mathematics. She joined the mathematics faculty at Oakland University as an assistant professor in 1977 but only stayed for a year. She started a second Ph.D., in computer science, at the University of Toronto, but was offered a faculty position there before completing the degree. When she made the decision to get a Ph.D in computer science she had never studied the subject before. There weren't many undergraduate classes at the time so she enrolled in upper-level courses and studied about 16 hours a day to do well. She spent eight years in industry, serving at IBM's Almaden Research Center in San Jose, California, first as a research scientist, then as manager of the Discrete Mathematics Group and manager of the Mathematics and Related Computer Science Department. She and her husband Nick Pippenger then moved to the University of British Columbia, where she stayed for 15 years and served as head of the Department of Computer Science from 1988 to 1995, vice president of student and academic services from 1995 to 1998, and dean of science from 1998 to 2002. From UBC she moved to Princeton and then Harvey Mudd College, where she is the first woman president. When she arrived at Mudd only about 30% of students and faculty were female. Today about 45% of the students and over 40% of the faculty are female. She became a citizen of the United States on January 29, 2009. Later in 2009, she joined the board of directors of the Microsoft Corporation. Awards and honors Klawe was inducted as a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery in 1996, a founding fellow of the Canadian Information Processing Society in 2006, a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2009, a fellow of the American Mathematical Society in 2012,List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society, retrieved January 27, 2013. and a fellow of the Association for Women in Mathematics in 2019. She has been awarded honorary doctorates from Ryerson Polytechnic University in 2001, the University of Waterloo in 2003, Queen's University in 2004, Dalhousie University in 2005, Acadia University in 2006, the University of Alberta in 2007, the University of OttawaMaria KLAWE, 2008  Doctorats honorifiques  Cabinet du recteur in 2008, the University of British Columbia in 2010, the University of Toronto in 2015, Concordia University in 2016, and McGill University in 2018 She was the winner of the 2014 Woman of Vision ABIE Award for Leadership from the Anita Borg Institute. In 2018 she was featured among \\"America's Top 50 Women In Tech\\" by Forbes. She also served as the president of the Association for Computing Machinery from 2002‚Äì2004, and in 2004 won the A. Nico Habermann award. Research Some of Klawe's best-cited research works concern algorithms for solving geometric optimization problems,. distributed leader election,. and the art gallery problem,. and studies of the effects of gender on electronic game-playing... She founded the Aphasia Project, a collaboration between UBC and Princeton to study aphasia and develop cognitive aids for people suffering from it, after her friend Anita Borg developed brain cancer.The Aphasia project web site.. Advocacy for technical women Klawe has been heavily involved with increasing the representation of women in STEM fields. While Klawe was the dean at UBC, she became the NSERC-IBM chair for Women in Science and Engineering. She was in charge of increasing female participation in science and engineering. During her five years as the chair appointment she increased female computer science majors from 16% to 27% and increased the number of female computer science faculty from 2 to 7. In 1991, together with Nancy Leveson, she founded CRA-W (The Computing Research Association's Committee on the Status of Women in Computing Research) and served as its first co-chair. She was also a personal friend of Anita Borg and served as the chair of the Board of Trustees of the Anita Borg Institute for Women and Technology from 1996 to 2011. Klawe was a huge advocate for salary negotiation by women, disagreeing with Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella, when he said \\"It's not really about asking for a raise, but knowing and having faith that the system will give you the right raise. That might be one of the initial 'super powers,' that quite frankly, women (who) don't ask for a raise have. It's good karma. It will come back.\\" Klawe believes that women should take an entry level computer science course during their first year at college that focuses on portraying the field as fun and engaging rather than trying to convince women to stay. She believes that if programming courses are taken at the middle school level then they have another four years of high school for peer pressure to get them disinterested again.\\" This is what she does at Harvey Mudd. She attributes the lack of women in technical fields due to how the media portrays women. In an interview with PBS she explains how TV shows in the 1970s showed men along with women who had successful careers such as doctors or lawyers and that caused the number of women going into medicine skyrocket. Klawe emphasizes that the introductory courses offered need to be presented in a problem-solving environment, not a competitive one where a few males dominate the conversation. Klawe believes the \\"testosterone culture\\" prevents women from continuing on with CS because the males that know everything scare away anyone who is trying to learn.

He oversees various projects including Dharma Publishing, Yeshe-De, Tibetan Aid Project,Our History and the construction of the Odiyan Copper Mountain Mandala. Tarthang Tulku also introduced Kum Nye into the West.Tarthang Tulku Biography As one of the last remaining lamas to have received a complete Buddhist education in pre-1959 Tibet, Tarthang Tulku left Tibet and taught in Benares, India, until emigrating to the United States of America in 1969 with his wife, the poet Nazli Nour. After settling in Berkeley, CA they established the Tibetan Aid Project (TAP) which serves the needs of the Tibetan refugee community. In 1963, Tarthang Tulku founded Dharma Publishing in Varanasi, India.About Dharma Publishing In 1971, the publishing house moved to California. The main purpose of Dharma Publishing is to preserve and distribute Tibetan Buddhist teachings and to bring these teachings to the West. Tarthang Tulku established the Nyingma Institute in 1972. Sister organizations have been established in Brazil, Germany, the Netherlands, and the UK. The various institutes offer classes, workshops, and retreats based on the books of Tarthang Tulku, with the main intent of spreading the teachings of the Buddha to the West. In 1983, Tarthang Tulku established the Yeshe De project, with the purpose of preserving and distributing sacred Tibetan texts in collaboration with the Tibetan Aid Project. These texts are distributed to Buddhist monks, nuns, and laypeople at the annual World Peace Ceremony, which Tarthang Tulku started in 1990 to bring the various Buddhist communities from across Asia to celebrate together at Bodh Gaya, in India. The World Peace Ceremony and the work of Yeshe De have and the Tibetan Aid Project have resulted in over 20 million texts being given away to practitioners in the Buddhist community over the last 18 years. Tarthang Tulku has written over 40 books covering a wide variety of topics, including meditation, Kum Nye, Nyingma Buddhist psychology, skillful means (bringing Buddhist practices to the workplace), and the Time, Space, and Knowledge series. Among Tarthang Tulku's current projects is the Mangalam Research Center for Buddhist Languages.

This policy generally increases the proportion of admitted students needing financial aid and often requires the institution to back the policy with an ample endowment or other source of funding. Being need-blind is a statutory requirement for institutions to participate in an antitrust exemption granted by Congress which remains in effect until September 30, 2022. An institution may be need-blind in any given year by policy (de jure) or by circumstances (de facto). Most colleges and universities cannot afford to offer adequate financial aid to all admitted students; some are not need-blind while others admit students on a need-blind basis but do not offer them sufficient aid to meet their full demonstrated financial need. In addition, many schools that admit domestic first-year students without regard to need do not extend this policy to international or transfer students. Schools which are need-blind and meet full need for all applicants are usually very selective as they tend to receive more applications than other schools. Institutions set their own definition of meeting full demonstrated need. There is no universal standard that an institution must abide by to claim that it meets full demonstrated need. For this reason, an admitted student's financial aid package can vary significantly at different schools that all claim to meet full demonstrated need. U.S. institutions that are need-blind and meet full demonstrated need for both U.S. and international students There are currently only seven U.S. higher education institutions that are need-blind and meet full demonstrated need for all applicants, including international students. These are: *Amherst College *Curtis Institute of Music *Harvard University *Massachusetts Institute of Technology *Minerva Schools at KGI *Princeton University *Yale University U.S. institutions that are need-blind for U.S. applicants and meet full demonstrated need A number of U.S. institutions of higher learning both offer need-blind admissions and meet the full demonstrated need for all domestic students, but are need-aware when it comes to international student admissions. However, all admitted students will have their demonstrated need met. The following schools fall into this  *Barnard College (need- aware for transfer students) *Boston College *Bowdoin College (need-aware for transfer students) *Brown University (need-aware for transfer students) *California Institute of Technology *Claremont McKenna College *Columbia University *Cornell University *Dartmouth College *Davidson College *Denison Universityhttps://denison.edu/campus/admission/apply-for-financial-aid *Duke University *Georgetown UniversityFINANCIAL AID *Grinnell College *Hamilton College *Harvey Mudd College *Johns Hopkins University *Middlebury College *Northwestern University *Olin College *Pomona College *Rice Universityhttp://stage.futureowls.rice.edu/futureowls/Money_Matters.asp?SnID=2 *Soka University of America *Stanford University *Swarthmore College *University of Chicago *University of Michigan (need-blind for in-state students only) *University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill *University of Notre Dame *University of Pennsylvania (need-blind for Mexican and Canadian students as well) *University of Richmond (need-aware for transfer students) *University of Southern CaliforniaUSC.edu *University of VirginiaAffording UVA *Vanderbilt University *Vassar College *Wellesley College *Williams College U.S. institutions that are not need-blind for U.S. applicants and meet full demonstrated need Many reputable institutions that once championed need-blind policies have modified their policies due to rising costs as well as subpar endowment returns. Such institutions include prestigious colleges that do not offer merit-based aid but promise to meet 100% of financial need (mostly through grants). These stated institutions refer to themselves as \\"need-aware\\" or \\"need-sensitive,\\" with policies that detract from their ability to admit and educate all qualified candidates but allow them to meet the full need of all admitted students. For instance, at Macalester College, Mount Holyoke College and Smith College, at least 95% of students are admitted without financial need being a factor, but a slim percentage, generally students who are waitlisted or who have borderline qualifications, are reviewed in consideration of the college's projected financial resources. All three colleges grant all admitted students financial aid packages meeting 100% of need.The Miscellany News  Since 1866: Financial Aid at Vassar  Crunching the numbers At Wesleyan University, attempted shifts to a \\"need-aware\\" admission policy have resulted in protests by the school's student body. *Bates College *Boston University *Bryn Mawr College *Carleton College *Case Western Reserve University *Colby College *Colgate University *College of the Holy Cross *Colorado College *Connecticut College *Franklin and Marshall College *Haverford College *Kenyon College *Lafayette College *Lehigh University (need-aware for waitlisted students) *Macalester College *Mount Holyoke College *Oberlin College *Occidental College *Pitzer College *Reed College *Scripps College *Skidmore College *Smith College *Thomas Aquinas College *Trinity College *Tufts University *Union College *Washington University in St. Louis *Wesleyan University U.S. institutions that are need-blind for U.S. applicants and do not meet full demonstrated need Some schools have a need-blind admissions policy, but do not guarantee to meet the full demonstrated financial need of the students they admit.

The owner of a cattle station is called a grazier. The largest cattle station in the world is Anna Creek Station in South Australia, which covers an area of . Improvements homestead Each station has a homestead where the property owner or the manager lives. Nearby cottages or staff quarters provide housing for the employees. Storage sheds and cattle yards are also sited near the homestead. Other structures depend on the size and location of the station. Isolated stations will have a mechanic's workshop, schoolroom, a small general store to supply essentials, and possibly an entertainment or bar area for the owners and staff. Water may be supplied from a river, bores or dams, in conjunction with rainwater tanks. Nowadays, if rural mains power is not connected, electricity is typically provided by a generator, although solar electricity systems have become increasingly common. Children were originally educated by correspondence lessons, often supervised by a governess, and via the School of the Air, but many children in remote areas went to boarding school for their secondary education. The Royal Flying Doctor service is available to remote stations in the northern and western areas of outback Australia. =Outstations= Wave Hill, NT, 1962 Historically, an outstation was a subsidiary homestead or other dwelling on Australian sheep or cattle stations that was more than a day‚Äôs return travel from the main homestead. (Book details here.) PDF Although the term later came to be more commonly used to describe a specific type of Aboriginal settlement, also known as a homeland community, it is still used on cattle stations today, for example the Sturt Creek Outstation of the Ruby Plains Station in The Kimberley, among others. The cattle station now known as Pigeon Hole was until 2000 an outstation of the Victoria River Downs Station. History General store, Tipperary Station, Northern Territory Donkey team at Wave Hill station, Northern Territory, ca. 1946 Tuaburra, an outstation of Bowen Downs Station, 1898 Charles Brown Fisher and Maurice Lyons, a Melbourne magistrate stocked Victoria River Downs in the early 1880s. Drover, Nathaniel Buchanan (1826‚Äì1901), overlanded 20,000 head of cattle from Wilmot to Victoria River Downs in c.1881 to establish their cattle venture. Previously Nat had from 1860 to 1867, stocked and managed Bowen Downs Station near Longreach, Queensland. Buchanan was associated with the opening up and stocking of several cattle stations in the Victoria River district and the Ord River region. The Gordon brothers and Nathaniel Buchanan took up Wave Hill on the Victoria River in 1883, one of the first cattle stations established west of the Telegraph Line. Their nearest neighbour was 200 miles (322 km) away. By 1898 James Tyson (8 April 1819 ‚Äì 4 December 1898), held 5,329,214 acres (2,156,680 ha) including 352,332 acres (142,585 ha) freehold. His stations included Bangate, Goondublui, Juanbung, Tupra and Mooroonowa in New South Wales; Heyfield in Victoria; and Glenormiston, Swanvale, Meteor Downs and Albinia Downs, Babbiloora, Carnarvon, Tully, Wyobie, Felton, Mount Russell and Tinnenburra in Queensland. Sidney Kidman (1857‚Äì1935) set up a chain of cattle stations along the sources of water, from the Gulf of Carpentaria, into South Australia to be within easy droving distance of the Adelaide markets. Aborigines have long played a big part in the cattle industry where they were competent stockmen on the cattle stations of the north. In 1950 it was legislated that the Aboriginal workers were now to be paid cash wages. Many cattle stations were established along the Great Dividing Range where only cattle raising was possible because of dingo attacks on sheep. The original Kunderang Station, on the eastern fall of the Great Dividing Range was taken up by Captain George Jobling as an outstation, and later sold under the Subdivision of Runs Act 1884. Kunderang was one of the few Great Dividing Range stations which was inhabited. The isolated homestead here, was built of solid Australian red cedar (Toona ciliata). Cattle and horses in stockyards, Victoria River Downs, NT, Australia Several major events have affected cattle stations starting with the Second World War and including the beef depression of the early 1970s, the technological achievements of the 1980s and the advent of live export markets in the more recent years. Roads and communications were greatly improved as a result of the War. Many of the Northern Territory cattle stations had been previously owned by English companies who also did not pay tax in Australia. The 33,280 square kilometres Victoria River Downs was sold in March 1909 to Lord Luke's Bovril Australian Estates for AU¬£180,000 and until 1950 they were not paying taxes to the Australian Government. In 1950 income tax was introduced to Northern Territory land owners. The very large stations were subdivided and country was available with reasonable conditions of tenure. This saw an influx of adventurous, working stockmen, with many doing well by mustering 'cleanskins' (unbranded cattle) on their new land. Zebu cattle were imported from Pakistan in 1956 and Brahman cattle were also brought from United States at about that time. Many new breeds were developed from these imports and this led to cattle that were much more tolerant to the Top End heat and cattle ticks.Taylor, Peter, Pastoral Properties of Australia, George Allen & Unwin, Sydney, London, Boston,1984 The Brucellosis and Tuberculosis Eradication Campaign (BTEC) was a national program to eradicate bovine brucellosis and bovine tuberculosis that commenced in 1970 after years of local jurisdictional activities. In the 1970s, interest rates soared and the American beef market collapsed causing the beef depression. A fat bullock was then worth less than a pair of locally made elastic side riding boots. The cattle herd was reduced to 21.8 million by 1978 in the wake of this crash.Austin, Nigel, Kings of the Cattle Country, Bay Books, Sydney & London, 1986 Roads and communications were further improved as a result of the Tuberculosis Eradication Campaign. In 1979, a disastrous drought struck and continued into 1983 becoming one of Australia's worst droughts. Helicopters were now being used to assist in mustering in the 1980s. Australia entered the Japanese beef market in 1988 with improved expectations for a better future in the beef cattle industry. Cattle empires The North Australian Pastoral Company Pty Limited (NAPCO) is now one of Australia's largest beef cattle producers, with a herd of over 180,000 cattle and fourteen cattle stations in Queensland and the Northern Territory.North Australian Pastoral Company The Australian Agricultural Company (AA Co) manages a cattle herd of more than 585,000 head.AACo Heytesbury Beef Pty Ltd owns and manages over two hundred thousand head of cattle across eight stations spanning the East Kimberley, Victoria River and Barkly Tablelands regions in Northern Australia.Heytesbury Beef Cattle station has a parallel term, sheep station, for those stations carrying sheep rather than cattle. In most cases the stations are in a rangeland context on pastoral leases. Many are larger than small countries. Some stations are not exclusively sheep or cattle stations but have a mix of cattle, sheep and even goats to make the owner less vulnerable to changes in the wool or beef prices. The phrase is also in traditional Australian English to denote something large and/or important.

It was so named because a similar rising had recently taken place in Prague, Bohemia, at that time closely associated with France through the House of Luxembourg, kings of Bohemia. Its causes lay in the reforms of Charles VII at the close of the Hundred Years' War, by which he sought to diminish the anarchy in France and its brigand-soldiery. The ordinances passed by the estates of langue d'o√Øl at Orl√©ans in 1439 not only gave the king an aid of 100,000 francs (an act which was later used by the king as though it were a perpetual grant and so freed him from that parliamentary control of the purse so important in England), but demanded as well royal nominations to officerships in the army, marking a gain in the royal prerogative which the nobility resolved to challenge. The main instigator was Charles I, Duke of Bourbon, who three years before had attempted a similar rising, and had been forced to ask pardon of the king. He and his bastard brother, John, were joined by the former favourite Georges de la Tremoille, John VI, duke of Brittany, who allied himself with the English, the duke of Alen√ßon, the count of Vend√¥me, and mercenaries captains like Rodrigo de Villandrando, Antoine de Chabannes, or Jean de la Roche. The duke of Bourbon won over the dauphin Louis, ‚Äîafterwards Louis XI, then only sixteen years old, and proposed to set aside the king in his favour, making him regent. Louis was readily induced to rebel; but the country was saved from a serious civil war by the energy of the king's officers and the solid loyalty of his \\"good cities\\". The constable de Richemont marched with the king's troops into Poitou, his old battleground with de la Tremoille, and in two months he had subdued the country. The royal artillery battered down the feudal strongholds. The dauphin and the duke of Alen√ßon failed to bring about any sympathetic rising in Auvergne, and the Praguerie was over, except for some final pillaging and plundering in Saintonge and Poitou, which the royal army failed to prevent. Charles then attempted to ensure the loyalty of the duke of Bourbon by the gift of a large pension, forgave all the rebellious gentry, and installed his son in Dauphin√©. The ordinance of Orleans was enforced. The dauphin was forced to beg his father's forgiveness.

This only changed during the final two episodes when Ms. Keller made her choice among the final two suitors, Howard Shan Lo and Wolfgang Gorny. Even then, the final episodes were dogged by controversy regarding 'leaked' photographs of Denise Keller and Wolfgang Gorny together in Bali. Detractors of the series accused these 'leaked' photos to be nothing more than a ploy to increase viewership of the series. Eye for a Guy 2 ended with Denise Keller choosing Wolfgang Gorny as the man who won her affections. Despite the low viewership of the series, Keller was lauded as a more compelling bachlorette compared to the first series' bachelorette, Rachel Lee. In September 2006, Keller and Dick Lee hosted a luxury lifestyle program shown in Singapore, entitled The Finer Side. This program featured the two hosts as they toured the glitzy and opulent side of Singapore and also featured candid chats with the city's rich, famous and powerful citizens regarding their extravagant lifestyles. Also in September 2006, Keller took a two-month sabbatical break in order to study theater arts at the Lee Strasberg Theater Institute in New York City. Prior to this, she traveled to New York City to cover the MTV Video Music Awards for MTV Asia. In 2007, Keller served as MasterCard's Fashion Ambassador for the Singapore Fashion Festival. She interviewed some of the world's top models and fashion designers in this capacity. She reprised this role in the 2008 Singapore Fashion Festival. Keller was the star of MasterCard's 'Priceless' campaign in Asia Pacific. Also in autumn 2007, Keller was a spokesperson for Hong Kong's Luxury week.

The Benue River is nearby, and the portion on the southern bank of the river is watered by streams flowing from the Cameroon region to the Benue. In 1991, the town was estimated to have a population of 56,570. The valley of the Benue has a climate generally unhealthy to Europeans but there are places in the northern part of the province, such as the Fula settlement of Wase on a southern spur of the Murchison hills, where the higher altitude gives an excellent climate. Tula‚ÄìWaja languages such as Dadiya and Bangwinji are spoken in the Muri Mountains.Kleinewillingh√∂fer, Ulrich. 2014. The languages of the Tula ‚Äì Waja Group. Adamawa Languages Project. Emir Of Muri Alh Abbas Tafida History In 1817, Muri was founded as a Fulbe jihad state. From 1892 to 1893 it was a de facto French protectorate, under Governor Louis Mizon (b. 1853 ‚Äì d. 1899). In 1901 it became a 25,800 m¬≤. province of the British protectorate of Northern Nigeria, bordered S. by Southern Nigeria, SE. by German Cameroon, E. by the province of Yola, N. by Bauchi, W. by Nasarawa and Bassa with an estimated population of about 828,000. The district of Katsena-Allah extends south of the Benue considerably west of 9¬∞ E., the approximate limit of the remainder of the province. The province is rich in forest products, and the Niger Company maintained trading stations on the river. Cotton is grown, and spinning thread, weaving and dyeing afford occupation to many thousands. Muri province included the ancient Jukun empire together with various small Fula states and a number of pagan tribes, among whom the Munshi, who extended into the provinces of Nassarawa and Bassa, were among the most turbulent. The Munshi occupy about 4000 m¬≤. in the Katsena-Alah district. The pagan tribes in the north of the province were lawless cannibals who by constant outrages and murders of traders long rendered the mail trade route to Bauchi unsafe, and cut off the markets of the Benue valley and the Cameroon from the Hausa states. Only two routes, one via Wase and the other via Gatari, passed through this belt. In the south of the province a similar belt of hostile pagans closed the access to the Cameroon except by two routes, Takum and Beli. For Hausa traders to cross the Muri province was a work of such danger and expense that before the advent of British administration the attempt was seldom made. Muri came nominally under British control in 1900. The principal effort of the administration has been to control and open the trade routes. In 1904 an expedition against the northern cannibals resulted in the capture of their principal fortresses and the settlement and opening to trade of a large district, the various routes to the Benue being rendered safe. In 1905 an expedition against the Munshi, rendered necessary by an unprovoked attack on the Niger Company's station at Abinsi, had a good effect in reducing the riverain portion of this tribe to submission. The absence of any central native authority delayed the process of bringing the province under administrative control. Its government was organized on the same system as the rest of Northern Nigeria, and under a British Resident. It was divided into three administrative divisions -east, central and west- with their respective headquarters at Lau, Amar and Ibi. Provincial and native courts of justice were established. The telegraph was carried to the town of Muri. Muri is one of the provinces in which the slave trade was most active, and its position between German territory and the Hausa states rendered it in the early days of the British administration a favorite route for the smuggling of slaves.

It is generally in the shape of a cylinder or a polygonal prism. In the earlier Byzantine churches the dome rested direct on the pendentives and the windows were pierced in the dome itself; in later examples, between the pendentive and the dome an intervening circular wall was built, in which the windows were pierced, and this is the type which was universally employed by the architects of the Renaissance, of whose works the best-known example is St. Peter's Basilica at Rome. Other examples of churches of this type are St Paul's Cathedral in London and the churches of the Les Invalides, the Val-de-Gr√¢ce, and the Sorbonne in Paris. Secular buildings may also have a tholobate: the United States Capitol dome in Washington, D.C. is set on a drum, as are numerous American state capitols built on designs inspired by the federal capitol in Washington.

From A Little Pretty Pocket-Book, 1767 Tip-cat (also called cat, cat and dog, one-a-cat, pussy, or piggy) is a pastime which consists of tapping a short billet of wood (usually no more than ) with a larger stick (similar to a baseball bat or broom handle); the shorter piece is tapered or sharpened on both ends so that it can be \\"tipped up\\" into the air when struck by the larger, at which point the player attempts to swing or hit it a distance with the larger stick while it is still in the air (similar to swinging at a pitch in baseball or cricket, etc.). There are many varieties of the game, but in the most common, the batter, having placed the billet, or \\"cat\\", in a small circle on the ground, tips it into the air and hits it to a distance. His opponent then offers him a certain number of points, based upon his estimate of the number of hops or jumps necessary to cover the distance. If the batter thinks the distance underestimated he is at liberty to decline the offer and measure the distance in jumps, and score the number made.  In popular culture  Italo Calvino has written a short story \\"Making Do\\" (in English, \\"Chi si contenta\\" in Italian), published in the collection Numbers in the Dark and Other Stories in which the only thing left legal for the citizens to do is to play tip-cat (Lippa in the Italian), which they do all day, until even that is forbidden them, too. A variant of the Italian 'lippa' is 'lizza'. Variations In Walsall in the 1950s, an alternative version required a set of stumps and bails, similar to those used in cricket; unlike cricket, these stumps were leant against a convenient wall, as the game was played in the street. The aim was to tip up the cat and then strike it towards the stumps with the object of dislodging the bails. Opposing fielders were allowed to catch the cat in flight.

Novi Ligure (; , ) is a city and comune north of Genoa, in the Piedmont region of the province of Alessandria of northwest Italy. The town produces food, iron, steel, and textiles. It is an important junction for both road and railroad. History The community of Curtis Nova in 970 was donated by Emperor Otto I to the monastery of St. Salvatore in Pavia, becoming a castle around the year 1000. Novi was a free commune until 1157, when it fell to Tortona. It was handed over the marquis of Montferrat in 1223, returning briefly to Tortona in 1232‚Äì64. In 1353 Giovanni Visconti of Milan and Genoa conquered it. Novi was donated to the latter in 1392, but was occupied by the condottiero Facino Cane in 1409‚Äì12. In 1447, after the death of Filippo Maria Visconti, the governors of the city decided to free forever from Milan, and gave it to Genoa. Around this time, a feudal lord Galeazzo Cavanna was Signore di Castel Gazzo, a fortress on the edge of the town. However, the Sforza of Milan retained its possession until the defeat of Ludovico il Moro, when it passed to the French until Andrea Doria conquered the city for Genoa in 1529. Novi Ligure remained part of the Republic of Genoa until 1805, with the exception of a brief Austrian-Piedmontese occupation in 1745‚Äì46. In 1799 it was the site of a French defeat by an Austro-Russian army, in which the French commander Joubert was killed. Novi was annexed to the French Empire and, after its fall, to the Kingdom of Sardinia. In 1818 it became provincial capital and received the suffix of \\"Ligure\\" to mark the historical vicinity to Genoa in contrast to the annexion of the province to that of Alessandria. Main sights In the 17th and 18th centuries Novi Ligure was a renowned resort for the rich Genoese families, as showed by the presence of numerous noble palaces in the historical center of the city, often decorated with frescoes facades. These include Palazzo Negroni, Palazzo Durazzo and others. The most important palace is Palazzo Delle Piane (Delle Piane family), situated in the historic Piazza Delle Piane. The Pieve of Santa Maria, on the road for Cassano, is the most ancient religious building (12th century). It has a nave with two aisles, and apses from the original edifice. In the interior is a fresco (1474) by Manfredino Boxilio, portraying the then sovereign of Novi, Oriana di Campofregoso and saints. The Oratory of St. Madeleine houses a massive cavalry composed of 21 wooden statues and two natural-size horses, as well as an 8-statuettes terracotta Complaint of Christ. Both are from Renaissance. Novi has retained part of its walls, erected in 1447 and partly demolished in the 19th century, together with the tower of the Castle. The subterraneans can be visited in summer. The Museo dei Campionissimi is a museum devoted to the two famous cyclists Costante Girardengo and Fausto Coppi and the bicycle history in general. Economy The most important factory of the town is the group Elah-Dufour that produces Novi chocolate and Big Fruit candies.

The album was well received and understandably the expectations at the label were high, probably too high. Although the highly refined Jubilee had brought the band considerable success at radio with \\"Truly, Truly\\", a shift within the industry was well underway. The label's constant nagging about \\"Call-out Response\\" was both a new term and a bewildering concept to our ears. The basic strategy: a radio station arranges to call up a listener who is asked to consume about 30 songs over the phone, perhaps 20 seconds of each. From this remote encounter, the listener will then proceed to judge the material. Insufficient call-out response was a big reason that Jubilee hardly got a shot at Warners.

Released on 1 April 1976, it is representative of the Australian film renaissance which occurred during that decade. Set mainly in Sydney during the 1920s and 1930s, including the Great Depression, it portrays the life of a young middle class woman struggling to raise two children after her marriage breaks up. Based on Caddie, the Story of a Barmaid, a partly fictitious autobiography of Catherine Beatrice \\"Caddie\\" Edmonds, it made Helen Morse a local star and earned Jacki Weaver and Melissa Jaffer each an Australian Film Institute Award. Plot In 1925 Sydney, Caddie leaves her adulterous and brutish husband and takes her two children, Ann and Terry, with her. Forced to work as a barmaid in a pub she struggles to survive. A brief affair with Ted (Jack Thompson) ends badly when his involvement with another woman comes to light, but she falls in love with a Greek immigrant, Peter (Takis Emmanuel). Peter has to return to Greece to face family obligations-he is already married to another woman. Caddie runs out of money and goes to work as a barmaid. Peter sends letters from Greece and Caddie has to evade police as she works for an SP bookie. Peter asks her to come to Athens but she decides to stay.

The budget was raised from the Australian Film Development Corporation, the Australian Women's Weekly, the Nine television network, the Secretariat for International Woman's Year, and Roadshow. Shooting began in late 1975. Parts of the movie were filmed in and around Balmain with a number of scenes at the Kent Hotel (which later became Caddies Restaurant) and the Sir William Wallace Hotel. Other scenes were filmed in Cameron Street, Edgecliff. Studio shots were taken at the Cinesound Studios in Rozelle. The writer and producer had both made films about early Australian cinema and were able to draw on this knowledge to help recreate Depression-era Sydney.David Stratton, The Last New Wave: The Australian Film Revival, Angus & Robertson, 1980 p. 143-145 The motion picture soundtrack by Patrick Flynn was produced for release on CD by Philip Powers from the original analog tapes by 1M1 Records.

Music and history Though each member of the band‚ÄîDana Janssen, Seth Olinsky, and Miles Seaton‚Äîcan be relegated to loosely defined roles, all members play several instruments and sing, as evidenced by their shows and recorded material. Live, the band uses improvisation and three-part harmonies in prominence. On their self-titled debut record, field recordings of a creaking chair, thunderclaps and the white noise of a television find their way alongside psychedelic and electronic elements, guitars and a glockenspiel. =Early years (2003‚Äì2006)= Between 2003 and 2007 the band was the hub of a social scene in Williamsburg, Brooklyn which revolved around the \\"Gimme! Coffee\\" coffee shop. Many of the events of this period served as material for songs. In 2003, the band began sending demos to Young God Records label head Michael Gira, who announced the following year their signing to the label. Akron/Family, culled from several albums' worth of material recorded in the band's Brooklyn apartment, was released in March 2005. The Wire said, \\"Akron/Family's hushed left field pastoralism invite comparison with the loose US scene of folk-derived weirdness ... Immaculately interwoven electronics and the care with which each beautifully recorded track unfolds recall Chicago post-rock ...\\" (Davies 2005). Released that same month was Angels of Light's Sing \\"Other People\\", on which Akron/Family served as the main backing band. Several extensive tours of the United States and Europe with Gira ‚Äî playing as Angels of Light ‚Äî followed immediately afterward, lasting much of the rest of the year. In the stretches supporting Gira, the band played dual roles as both the supporting and headlining act; in the stretches without Gira, their touring mates included Great Lake Swimmers and Sir Richard Bishop of Sun City Girls. The next Akron/Family material released was Akron/Family & Angels of Light, a split album with Angels of Light in October 2005. Shortly after releasing Meek Warrior in October 2006, the band debuted seven demo songs on WNYC radio, suggesting another album was already in the works. The band has contributed vocals to Canadian post-rock band Do Make Say Think's album, You, You're a History in Rust and the more recent, Other Truths. =Love Is Simple (2007)= In September 2007, it was announced that original member Ryan Vanderhoof departed the group \\"amicably sometime between the completion of (2007 release) Love Is Simple and the start of the band's U.S. tour\\" according to Akron/Family's publicist. The reasoning behind his departure was that \\"he went to live in a Buddhist Dharma center (Tsogyelgar/Flaming Jewel) in the Midwest.\\" The Akron/Family tour in September 2007 included supporting acts Megafaun and Greg Davis who joined the Akron/Family onstage to create a seven- piece band. Megafaun and Greg Davis also played in Akron/Family band for their October 2007 west coast tour. The Dodos played the opening sets on this tour. In the spring of 2008 the band toured with Megafaun as their supporting act. In addition to opening, all three members of Megafaun joined Akron/Family onstage to create a six-piece band. Akron/Family are primarily performing as a three-piece band now. =Set 'Em Wild, Set Em Free (2008‚Äì2011) = On October 5, 2008, the News section of Akron/Family's official website was updated to announce that the band had begun recording a new album. The album, titled Set 'Em Wild, Set Em Free was released on May 5, 2009, by Dead Oceans Records. Crammed Discs will be putting it out in Europe on the same date. On February 15, 2009 Set 'Em Wild, Set Em Free leaked onto the internet. Throughout the late summer and into the fall of 2009, Akron/Family headlined a tour with Slaraffenland as the opening band and Jeffrey Lewis and the Junkyard serving as lead support. Slaraffenland also contributed in much of Akron/Family's set, playing percussion and horns. =S/T II:The Cosmic Birth and Journey of Shinju TNT (2011‚Äì2012)= Akron/Family sent out an email confirming the title of their following album, writing \\"This album is titled S/T II: The Cosmic Birth and Journey of Shinju TNT. We have no idea what that means. After the jump you‚Äôll find a photo of the note found in the brown box delivery with the song list, video, and an mp3 of the song fragments retrieved from the TDK CDR, relics of a new tomorrow and a brighter Akron/Family filled future. These are the beginnings, hell or high water you‚Äôll find S/T II: The Cosmic Birth and Journey of Shinju TNT in stores in the U.S. on February 8, and March 14 in the U.K.\\" A suspected version of the album was leaked to the internet on December 24, 2010, though there was a dispute on numerous message boards and filesharing communities whether or not it was the actual album or a remixed version leaked by the band due to the radically different nature of the material. A different, second version of the album was leaked on December 28, 2010, confirming suspicions that the band was leaking alternate mixes of the album. The actual album leaked on January 13. It is suspected there are 6 different mixes circulating as well as the official release. A compilation of the leaked, remixed & deconstructed, versions of the album was released as the 2LP on Record Store Day 2011. The member listing for this release is Phil Cook, Greg Davis, Dana Janssen, Chris Koltay, Mark Lawson, Seth Olinsky, and Miles Seaton. The band appears on Swans' 2012 album The Seer, on the track \\"A Piece of the Sky\\". During this time period, the band was also involved in a public spat for \\"lifting\\" a skull logo for its merchandise from California powerviolence band Man Is The Bastard. =Sub Verses and hiatus (2013‚Äìpresent) = Akron/Family's sixth studio album Sub Verses was released April 30, 2013 on Dead Oceans. The band began their tour for the album January 29, 2013 and concluded on December 8. After their 2013 tour, Akron/Family decided to call it quits to focus on personal side projects, leaving the door open for a possible reunion in the future. Meanwhile, front man Olinsky started his own band Cy Dune and cocreated Lightning Records, Janssen started the band Dana Buoy and Seaton pursued a solo career under his own name.

It was founded by colonists from Miletus, probably about 600 BC. The city was situated some 10 km from the mouth of the Tyras River, which is now called the Dniester. The surrounding native tribe was called the Tyragetae. The ruins of Tyras are now located in the modern city of Bilhorod- Dnistrovskyi in the Odessa Oblast of Ukraine. History Of no great importance in early times, in the 2nd century BC Tyras fell under the dominion of native kings whose names appear on its coins, and it was destroyed by the Getae about 50 BC. In 56 AD, it seems to have been restored by the Romans under Nero and henceforth formed part of the province of Lower Moesia. There exists a series of its coins with heads of emperors from Domitian to Alexander Severus. Indeed, the autonomous minting of coins in the city, called by the Romans Alba Julia, lasted from the time of the emperor Domitian (81 AD) up to the end of the reign of the emperor Alexander Severus (235 AD) with few breaks. The coins of Tyras of this period were of copper with the portraits of the members of the Imperial house for the province of the Roman Empire. In Tyras was stationed a small unit of the Roman fleet, Classis Flavia Moesica. Soon after the time of Alexander Severus, it was partially destroyed by the Goths, but archaeological findings show that Romans remained there until the end of the 4th century under Theodosius I. Later the Byzantines renamed the city, destroyed by barbarian invasions, with the new name Maurokastron \\"black fort\\". Its government was in the hands of five archons, a senate, a popular assembly and a registrar. The images on its coins suggest a trade in wheat, wine and fish. The few inscriptions are also mostly concerned with trade. Remains of the city are scanty, as its site has been covered by the great medieval fortress called by the Genoese Maurocastro (and later Akkerman/Cetatea AlbƒÉ).

The district was subdivided in 1990 into six new districts, see present-day districts of Krak√≥w for more details. The name Podg√≥rze roughly translates as the base of a hill. Initially a small settlement, in the years following the First Partition of Poland the town's development was promoted by the Austria-Hungary Emperor Joseph II who in 1784 granted it the city status, as the Royal Free City of Podg√≥rze. In the following years it was a self-governing administrative unit. After the Third Partition of Poland in 1795 and the takeover of the entire city by the Empire, Podg√≥rze lost its political role of an independent suburb across the river from the Old Town. The administrative reform of 1810 which followed the expansion of the Duchy of Warsaw brought Podg√≥rze together with the rest of the historic city. However, after the Congress of Vienna made Krak√≥w a free city in 1815, Podg√≥rze fell back under the Austrian rule and remained there for the rest of the 19th century. According to Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, in 1910 it was the 13th largest town in the Austrian-ruled Galicia (population 18,142 in 1900). In the years leading to the return of Polish independence, the city council discussions from July 1915 made Podg√≥rze again a part of the Greater Krak√≥w (Wielki Krak√≥w); its president, the vice president of a single administrative unit.Adam Marczewski, Podg√≥rze history and its Jewish Community on Virtual Shtetl. Retrieved April 26, 2012. Brief history The oldest man-made structure in Podg√≥rze is the Krakus Mound () on Lasota Hill, believed to be the grave of the legendary prince Krakus. It is the largest prehistoric mound in Poland and one of the best view points in the city. The Austrian bridge named Carl's Bridge (), linking Podg√≥rze with the Krak√≥w proper across the Vistula was built in 1802. This wooden structure located between today's Mostowa and Brodzi≈Ñskiego streets, survived only until 1813 when it was destroyed in a flood. Towards the end of the Austrian rule, in 1915 the size of Podg√≥rze reached of the size of Krak√≥w. Since the return of Poland's independence, it remained integrated into the city. It includes the historic part of Podg√≥rze with the triangular market square and impressive St. Joseph Church as well as the green hills of Krzemionki with the World War II quarry called Liban. It also includes the site of the Nazi Krak√≥w Ghetto and a factory of Oskar Schindler who saved nearly 1,200 Jews from the camps, as well as the old villages (now suburbs) of P≈Çasz√≥w, Rybitwy and Przew√≥z.

It is one of the earliest and most primitive of the ungulates, typifying the family Phenacodontidae and the order Perissodactyla. Description The typical Phenacodus primaevus was a relatively small ungulate about 1.5 m (4.9 ft) long and weighted up to 56 kg, of slight build, with straight limbs each terminating in five complete toes, and walking in the digitigrade fashion of the modern horse.T.S. Kemps (2005) The origin and evolution of mammals p.237http://hjerison.bol.ucla.edu/pdf/neocortex.pdf The middle toe was the largest, and the weight of the body was mainly supported on this and the two adjoining digits, which appear to have been encased in hooves, foreshadowing the tridactyl type common in perissodactyls and certain extinct groups of ungulates. The skull was small, with proportionately minute brain; and the arched back, strong lumbar vertebrae, long and powerful tail, and comparatively feeble fore-quarters all proclaim kinship with the primitive carnivores Creodonta. All the bones of the limbs are separate, and those of the carpus and tarsus do not alternate - each one in the upper row is placed immediately above the corresponding one in the row below. The full series of forty-four teeth was developed; and the upper molars were short-crowned, or brachyodont, with six low cusps, two internal, two intermediate and two external, so that they were of the typical primitive bunodont structure. In habits, the animal was cursorial and herbivorous, or possibly carnivorous. In the early Paleocene of North America, the place of the above species was taken by Tetraclaenodon puercensis, an animal only half the size of P. primaevus, with the terminal joints of the limbs intermediate between hoofs and claws, and the first and fifth toes taking their full share in the support of the weight of the body. These two genera may be regarded as forming the earliest stages in the evolution of the horse, coming below Hyracotherium (see Equidae). As ancestors of the artiodactyl section of the Ungulata, we may look to forms more or less closely related to the North American Lower Eocene genus Mioclaenus, typifying the family Mioclaenidae. The species of Mioclaenus were five-toed, bunodont Condylarthra, with a decided approximation to the perissodactyl type in the structure of the feet. A second type of Condylarthra from the North American Lower Eocene is represented by the family Meniscotheriidae, including the genus Meniscotherium. A 2014 cladistic analysis places both Phenacodus and Meniscotherium within stem perissodactyls. Teeth and jaws probably referable to the Condylarthra have been obtained in European early Tertiary formations. All Ungulata probably originated from Condylarthra.

Career Juden was one of the top high school pitching prospects in the nation after his senior season, leading Salem High School to the Massachusetts state championship in 1989. He was a High School All-American and was named the Gatorade Massachusetts Baseball Player of the Year, and Boston Globe All- Scholastic spring highlighted player. The Houston Astros selected him with the 12th overall pick in the first round of the 1989 Major League Baseball draft. Juden began his professional career by going 10-0 in his first 10 starts with the Osceola Astros of the Class-A Florida State League, and he was selected to the FSL All-Star Team before getting moved up to the AA Columbus Mudcats in 1990. In 1991 and 1993 Juden was a part of 2 PCL Championship teams as a member of the Tucson Toros of the Pacific Coast League. Juden made his major league debut on September 15, 1991, becoming the youngest active player in baseball that year when he appeared in relief of Chris Gardner in a game against the Cincinnati Reds. Despite his early promise, Juden battled some injuries early on in his career when he had elbow surgery during his stint with the Phillies from 1994-95. He started his MLB career 3-11. After his surgery, Juden went on to have a 24-21 record from 1996 on until his release by the New York Yankees in the spring of 2000. His best season was 1997 when he was the National League Pitcher of the Week, beating Roger Clemens in front of a record crowd on Canada Day in Toronto. Juden pitched 161 innings for the Montreal Expos and Cleveland Indians that year, compiling an 11‚Äì6 record with 136 strikeouts and a 4.46 ERA, and winning an American League Championship in Cleveland. Juden was involved in a large number of trades throughout the course of his career. He and closer Doug Jones were traded to the Philadelphia Phillies after the 1993 season in exchange for Mitch Williams. In 1995, he and prospect Tommy Eason went to the San Francisco Giants for infielder Mike Benjamin. Two years later, Juden moved from the Montreal Expos to the Indians for reliever Steve Kline at the trading deadline, and after that season ended, he and Marquis Grissom went to the Milwaukee Brewers, in a deal for Mike Fetters, Ben McDonald, and Ron Villone. This deal was enveloped in controversy after it became clear that McDonald had suffered a career-ending shoulder injury shortly before it had been completed. Juden last pitched in the major leagues in 1999 as a member of the 1999 World Series Champion New York Yankees. He retired after that season, and an attempt at a comeback in 2004 with the Nashua Pride of the independent Atlantic League proved unsuccessful. He ended his career with a 27‚Äì32 record, 441 strikeouts, and a 4.81 ERA in 533 career major league innings. Personal life Since retiring from baseball, Juden has been coaching Little League, Babe Ruth League, and 1 year in the Prospect League with the inaugural season of the Hannibal Cavemen as their pitching coach. He has two sons, Fredrick and Dalton, who enjoy playing baseball and basketball. In 2002, Juden wrote, recorded, and co-produced his first album with Keith Ridenhour at Ridenhour Studios in South Florida. The CD was mastered by Dan O'Brien. The CD is titled Anything You Want To Be.

It tells the story of four hippies, who kidnap a retired Mafia mob boss, holding him for ransom. The film is an anti-establishment story that questions the values of Middle America and the older generation. Plot Four bored beach bums from Miami come across kids playing with toy guns. They chase one of them into a house, which, by chance, belongs to one Roc Delmonico, a former gangster who is now retired from organized crime and has become a respectable businessman. Delmonico assumes it to be a kidnapping and volunteers to go quietly. The hippies like the idea, particularly their leader, Taurus, a gigolo who lives off rich ladies. He and his accomplices, Sureshot, Herby and Sandy, drive off with Delmonico in the trunk of their car. They hide out and demand a ransom of $200,000. No one, unfortunately, will pay the ransom‚Äînot Delmonico's unhappy wife, Monica, or his business partner, Fred, or even Sam, his old mob boss. The frustrated crooks decide that it is hopeless, but Delmonico is so offended that he personally takes charge of his own kidnapping. He raises the demand to $3 million, vowing to reveal secrets that will ruin Monica, Fred and Sam. The money is paid, whereupon the greedy Taurus suggests to Delmonico that they kill the others, leaving a two-way split. However, Delmonico knows not only that the boy cannot be trusted, but also that the bank has marked the bills from the ransom and that the police will trace them. Delmonico sets fire to the money and walks away. When asked what he will do now, Delmonico responds, without looking back, \\"Who knows?\\" Soundtrack Only a minor success as a film, The Happening is most notable today both as one of Faye Dunaway's earliest films and for its self-titled theme song. Recorded by The Supremes, \\"The Happening\\" became a Number One hit on the Billboard Hot 100 when released as a single on the Motown label. Another music piece, \\"The Fuzz\\", was used by several local area TV news programs in the United States and Canada in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and a rearrangement of the same composition is still used by Brazil's Rede Globo national newscast Jornal Nacional, and Televisa in Mexico for national newcast 24 Horas.

In 2013, Elsevier established the Mary Ellen Rudin Young Researcher Award which is awarded annually to a young researcher, mainly in fields adjacent to general topology.  Early life and education  Mary Ellen (Estill) Rudin was born in Hillsboro, Texas to Joe Jefferson Estill and Irene (Shook) Estill. Her mother Irene was an English teacher before marriage, and her father Joe was a civil engineer. The family moved with her father's work, but spent a great deal of Mary Ellen's childhood around Leakey, Texas.Albers, D.J. and Reid, C. (1988) \\"An Interview with Mary Ellen Rudin\\". The College of Mathematics Journal 19(2) pp.114-137 She had one sibling, a younger brother. Both of Rudin's maternal grandmothers had attended Mary Sharp College near their hometown of Winchester, Tennessee. Rudin remarks on this legacy and how much her family valued education in an interview. She attended the University of Texas, completing her B.A. in 1944 after just three years before moving into the graduate program in mathematics under Robert Lee Moore. Her graduate thesis presented a counterexample to one of \\"Moore's axioms\\". She completed her Ph.D. in 1949. During her time as an undergraduate, she was a member of the Phi Mu Women's Fraternity, and was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa society. In 1953, she married mathematician Walter Rudin, whom she met while teaching at Duke University. They had four children.  Career  At the beginning of her career, Rudin taught at Duke University and the University of Rochester.\\"Mary Ellen Rudin\\", Profiles of Women in Mathematics. Association of Women in Mathematics . Accessed March 13, 2015. She took a position as Lecturer at the University of Wisconsin in 1959, and was appointed Professor of Mathematics in 1971. After her retirement in 1991, she continued to serve as a Professor Emerita. She was the first Grace Chisholm Young Professor of Mathematics and also held the Hilidale Professorship,. She was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1974 in Vancouver.Rudin, Mary Ellen. \\"The Normality of Products.\\" In Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians, Vancouver, 1974, vol. 1, pp. 81‚Äì86. She served as vice-president of the American Mathematical Society, 1980‚Äì1981. In 1984 she was selected to be a Noether Lecturer. She was an honorary member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (1995). In 2012 she became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society, retrieved 2013-07-07. Rudin is best known in topology for her constructions of counterexamples to well-known conjectures. In 1958, she found an unshellable triangulation of the tetrahedron. Most famously, Rudin was the first to construct a Dowker space, which she did in 1971, thus disproving a conjecture of Clifford Hugh Dowker that had stood, and helped drive topological research, for more than twenty years. Her example fueled the search for \\"small\\" ZFC Dowker spaces. She also proved the first Morita conjecture and a restricted version of the second. Her last major result was a proof of Nikiel's conjecture. Early proofs that every metric space is paracompact were somewhat involved, but Rudin provided an elementary one. \\"Reading the articles of Mary Ellen Rudin, studying them until there is no mystery takes hours and hours; but those hours are rewarded, the student obtains power to which few have access. They are not hard to read, they are just hard mathematics, that's all.\\" (Steve WatsonW. S.

Ballidu is also north of the town of Wongan Hills which, along with a few other small towns such as Cadoux and Bindi Bindi make up the Shire of Wongan-Ballidu. History The name Ballidu is a hybrid name, coming from \\"balli\\", a Noongar word meaning \\"on this side\\" or \\"in this direction\\", and \\"Duli\\" after a nearby rockhole. The townsite was gazetted in 1914, with street names of the original settlers. A primary school opened in the town on 4 September 1922, moving into permanent premises in 1924. The streets in Ballidu are named after varieties of wheat. The bulk wheat bins in town opened in 1940. Population Located in the Central Midlands division of the Wheatbelt, the town relies upon agriculture, mainly wheat production. Increasing automation in agriculture has seen the size of surrounding holdings increase and the population of the town steadily decrease. At the 2016 census, Ballidu had a population of 66 in decline from 82 in 2006. The town retains a primary school, an art gallery, a hall and a general store. 2016 saw a school enrolment of four. Community events Each year, the Ballidu School Parents and Citizens Association hosts the annual \\"Bike-it to Ballidu\\", which consists of teams from the primary school along with adults cycling from Wongan Hills in turn to Ballidu. The whole ride is approximately 34 km and starts from the Wongan Hills visitor centre ending in Alpha Street, Ballidu.

Meyer A baluster is a vertical moulded shaft, square, or lathe-turned form found in stairways, parapets, and other architectural features. In furniture construction it is known as a spindle. Common materials used in its construction are wood, stone, and less frequently metal and ceramic. A group of balusters supporting handrail, coping, or ornamental detail are known as a balustrade.\\"A row of balusters surmounted by a rail or coping\\" 1644. OED; The term baluster shaft is used to describe forms such as a candlestick, upright furniture support, and the stem of a brass chandelier. The term banister (also bannister) refers to the system of balusters and handrail of a stairway. It may be used to include its supporting structures, such as a supporting newel post. The term derives from the swelling form of the half-open flower of Punica granatum, in Italian balaustra Etymology According to OED, \\"baluster\\" is derived through the , from , from balaustra, \\"pomegranate flower\\" [from a resemblance to the swelling form of the half-open flower (illustration, below right)],The early sixteenth-century theoretical writer Diego da Sangredo (Medidas del Romano, 1526) detected this derivation, N. Llewellyn noted, in \\"Two notes on Diego da Sangredo: 2. The baluster and the pomegranate flower\\", in Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 40 (1977:240-300); Paul Davies and David Hemsoll's detailed history, \\"Renaissance Balusters and the Antique\\", in Architectural History 26 (1983:1‚Äì23, 117‚Äì122) p.8 notes uses of the word in fifteenth-century documents and explores its connotations for sixteenth-century designers, pp 12ff. from Latin balaustium, from Greek Œ≤Œ±ŒªŒ±œçœÉœÑŒπŒøŒΩ (balaustion).  History  The earliest examples of balusters are those shown in the bas-reliefs representing the Assyrian palaces, where they were employed as functional window balustrades and apparently had Ionic capitals. As an architectural element alone the balustrade did not seem to have been known to either the Greeks or the Romans,Wittkower 1974 but baluster forms are familiar in the legs of chairs and tables represented in Roman bas-reliefs,Davies and Hemsoll 1983:2. where the original legs or the models for cast bronze ones were shaped on the lathe, or in Antique marble candelabra, formed as a series of stacked bulbous and disc-shaped elements, both kinds of sources familiar to Quattrocento designers. The application to architecture was a feature of the early Renaissance architecture: late fifteenth-century examples are found in the balconies of palaces at Venice and Verona. These quattrocento balustrades are likely to be following yet-unidentified Gothic precedents. They form balustrades of colonettesA colonette is a miniature column, used decoratively. as an alternative to miniature arcading. Stone balusters in the Basilica of San Zeno, Verona (constructed 967‚Äì1398 AD) Rudolf Wittkower withheld judgement as to the inventor of the balusterH. Siebenh√ºner, in tracing the baluster's career, found its origin in the profile of the round base of Donatello's Judith and Holofernes, c 1460 (Siebenh√ºner, \\"Docke\\", in Reallexikon zur Deutsche Kunstgeschichte vol. 4 1988:102-107) and credited Giuliano da Sangallo with using it consistently as early as the balustrade on the terrace and stairs at the Medici villa at Poggio a Caiano (c 1480),Davies and Hemsol 1983 note the earliest uses of both types of baluster in fictive classicising thrones and architecture in paintings. They instance an earlier use in real architecture on the main fa√ßade of the Palazzo Ducale, Urbino, where Luciano Laurana was employed (p. 6 and pl. 3j). and used balustrades in his reconstructions of antique structures. Sangallo passed the motif to Bramante (his Tempietto, 1502) and Michelangelo, through whom balustrades gained wide currency in the 16th century. Wittkower distinguished two types, one symmetrical in profile that inverted one bulbous vase-shape over another, separating them with a cushionlike torus or a concave ring, and the other a simple vase shape, whose employment by Michelangelo at the Campidoglio steps (c 1546), noted by Wittkower, was preceded by very early vasiform balusters in a balustrade round the drum of Santa Maria delle Grazie (c 1482), and railings in the cathedrals of Aquileia (c 1495) and Parma, in the cortile of San Damaso, Vatican, and Antonio da Sangallo's crowning balustrade on the Santa Casa at Loreto installed in 1535, and liberally in his model for the Basilica of Saint Peter.These earlier appearances were adduced by Davies and Hemsol 1983:7f. Because of its low center of gravity, this \\"vase-baluster\\" may be given the modern term \\"dropped baluster\\".Davies and Hemsol 1983:1. Materials used Ornate cast ironHong Kong Investor With Eye on the Past Acquires Landmark Bradbury Building, Los Angeles Times filigree balustrades in the Bradbury Building in downtown Los Angeles, California Cast-stone balusters were a development of the 18th century in Great Britain (see Coade stone), and cast iron balusters a development largely of the 1840s. * Carved stone * Cast stone * Plaster * Polymer * Polyurethane/polystyrene * Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) * Precast concrete * Wood * Wrought iron Profiles and style changes Drawing of a baluster column in the article \\"Anglo-Saxon Architecture\\" in the Archaeological Journal, Volume 1 (1845) The baluster, being a turned structure, tends to follow design precedents that were set in woodworking and ceramic practices, where the turner's lathe and the potter's wheel are ancient tools. The profile a baluster takes is often diagnostic of a particular style of architecture or furniture, and may offer a rough guide to date of a design, though not of a particular example. Some complicated Mannerist baluster forms can be read as a vase set upon another vase. The high shoulders and bold, rhythmic shapes of the Baroque vase and baluster forms are distinctly different from the sober baluster forms of Neoclassicism, which look to other precedents, like Greek amphoras. The distinctive twist-turned designs of balusters in oak and walnut English and DutchTwist-turned legs on a backstool feature prominently in a conversation piece of a couple in an elaborately fashionable Dutch interior, painted by Eglon van der Neer (1678): illustration. seventeenth-century furniture, which took as their prototype the Solomonic column that was given prominence by Bernini, fell out of style after the 1710s. Once it had been taken from the lathe, a turned wood baluster could be split and applied to an architectural surface, or to one in which architectonic themes were more freely treated, as on cabinets made in Italy, Spain and Northern Europe from the sixteenth through the seventeenth centuries.The architectural invention of the applied half-baluster, with a caveat concerning \\"the fallacy of first recorded appearances\\", by Filippino Lippi in the painted architecture all'antica of his St. Philip revealing the Demon in the Strozzi Chapel, Santa Maria Novella, Florence, and in Michelangelo's planned use in the Medici Chapel, is explored by Paul Joannides, \\"Michelangelo, Filippino Lippi and the Half-Baluster\\", The Burlington Magazine 123 No. 936 (March 1981:152‚Äì154). Modern baluster design is also in use for example in designs influenced by the Arts and Crafts movement in a 1905 row of houses in Etchingham Park Road Finchley London England. Outside Europe, the baluster column appeared as a new motif in Mughal architecture, introduced in Shah Jahan's interventions in two of the three great fortress-palaces, the Red Fort of Agra and Delhi,\\"There are no free- standing baluster columns of Shah Jahan's reign in the Fort at Lahore\\", according to Ebba Koch (\\"The Baluster Column: A European Motif in Mughal Architecture and Its Meaning\\", Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, 45 (1982:251‚Äì262) p. 252) but balustrades are a feature of all three. in the early seventeenth century. Foliate baluster columns with naturalistic foliate capitals, unexampled in previous Indo-Islamic architecture according to Ebba Koch, rapidly became one of the most widely used forms of supporting shaft in Northern and Central India in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.Ebba Koch 1982:251‚Äì262. The modern term baluster shaft is applied to the shaft dividing a window in Saxon architecture. In the south transept of the Abbey in St Albans, England, are some of these shafts, supposed to have been taken from the old Saxon church. Norman bases and capitals have been added, together with plain cylindrical Norman shafts. Balusters are normally separated by at least the same measurement as the size of the square bottom section. Placing balusters too far apart diminishes their aesthetic appeal, and the structural integrity of the balustrade they form. Balustrades normally terminate in heavy newel posts, columns, and building walls for structural support. Balusters may be formed in several ways. Wood and stone can be shaped on the lathe, wood can be cut from square or rectangular section boards, while concrete, plaster, iron, and plastics are usually formed by molding and casting. Turned patterns or old examples are used for the molds.

A transfer table or traverser is a piece of railway equipment. It functions similarly to a turntable, although it cannot be used to turn vehicles around. Overview A transfer table, also known as a traverser, consists of a single length of track that can be moved from side to side, in a direction perpendicular to the track. There are often multiple tracks on one side of the table and a single or multiple track(s) on the other.  Applications  Disused traverser outside the former Eveleigh Carriage Workshops in Australia A traverser inside Golden Rock Railway Workshop in India. =Yards= They are often found in yards with locomotive maintenance facilities. The table allows a shed with multiple stalls for locomotives or carriages to be served by a single track, without the need for points that could take up a much larger area. =Terminal stations= In Europe there were traversers at the terminal platforms at Birmingham Moor Street station and at the former Gare de la Bastille terminus in Paris. These were installed to release locomotives from arriving passenger trains to the adjoining track. They had three parallel tracks on the table so that whichever positions the traverser was in an incoming passenger train would not be faced with a void. Traversers were used at metropolitan termini located in confined sites, such as Kew and St Kilda in suburban Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, which worked only two tracks. In 2013 the Port of Felixstowe installed a traverser across nine tracks at its new North Terminal as ordinary points could not be fitted while allowing 35-wagon trains of shipping containers. =Rack railways= A two track transfer table used as a switch at Mount Washington Cog Railway Systems like the Locher rack system do not allow normal switches and transfer tables are used instead, as on the Pilatus Railway. A transfer table contains two tracks with different configurations. The table is moved side way to choose the configuration that connects the track that the incoming train will be traveling from and to. Using transfer table as a switch allows the center rack rail to be aligned for the cog wheels to continually drive the train forward while crossing the switch. =Roller coasters= Smaller traversers are frequently used on roller coasters to switch out trains. = Monorails and maglevs = Traversers are used on monorails and maglevs. The Sydney Monorail had a traverser connected to about 6 storage roads. When the track in the main line moved to a stabling road, another track moved into the main line position. = Stadiums = Maintaining grass in stadiums can be a problem if the stadium keeps the grass in the shade. A solution is to mount the playing field on a single huge traverser, which can be rolled out under one of the grandstands onto the sunny side of that grandstand. Combined turntable and traverser Collinwood yards usage of a turntable leading into a transfer table In rare instances, the turning features of a turntable have been combined with the lateral motion of a transfer table. Examples of such installations are in Asia and Europe. An example of both pieces of equipment was in use up until the 1970s at the Collinwood Yards in Cleveland, Ohio. It allowed a single turntable to serve a linear train shed.  Preserved examples  Didcot Railway Centre, UK, has a traverser for transferring coaching stock between the roads of the carriage maintenance sheds. The National Tramway Museum at Crich, in Derbyshire, England has a traverser between the depot roads. Pilatus Railway has a lot of traversers, as its rack railway system does not allow switches. Sydney Tramway Museum, Sydney, Australia has a traverser between the depot tracks. Traversers are common on ridable miniature railways to access the shed and maintenance facilities. There may be a desire to reduce the number of points required, or ‚Äî in the case of raised track with overhanging carriages ‚Äî to allow switching with the same restrictions found on a saddle-beam monorail.

The Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) is a private, non-profit oceanographic research center in Moss Landing, California. MBARI was founded in 1987 by David Packard, and is primarily funded by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation. Christopher Scholin serves as the institute's president and chief executive officer, managing a work force of approximately 220 scientists, engineers, and operations and administrative staff. At MBARI, scientists and engineers work together to develop new tools and methods for studying the ocean. Long-term funding from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation allows the institute to take on studies that traditional granting institutions may be reluctant to sponsor. Part of David Packard's charge for MBARI was to \\"Take risks. Ask big questions.

The Argentine National Anthem refers to the state as \\"the United Provinces of the South\\". The Constitution of Argentina recognises Provincias Unidas del R√≠o de la Plata as one of the official names of the country, referred to as \\"Argentine Nation\\" (Naci√≥n Argentina) in modern legislation. The Constitution: \\"\\" (\\"Article 35. The denominations successively adopted from 1810 to the present ‚Äì United Provinces of the R√≠o de la Plata and Argentine Republic, Argentine Confederation ‚Äì shall henceforth be interchangeable official names to describe the Government and territory of the provinces. The phrase \\"Argentine Nation\\" is used for the formulation and the enactment of laws.\\") Description The United Provinces of South America were bordered on the south by the sparsely populated territories of the Pampas and Patagonia, home to the Mapuche, Ranquel and Puelche peoples. To the north, the Gran Chaco was populated by the Guaycuru nations. To the northwest, across the Upper Peru, lay the Spanish Viceroyalty of Per√∫. Across the Andes, to the west, was the Spanish-controlled Captaincy General of Chile. To the northeast was Colonial Brazil, a part of the Portuguese Empire (in 1815, the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves), later the Empire of Brazil in 1821. Government The change from the Viceroyalty into the United Provinces was not merely a change of governors, but a revolutionary process that would replace the absolutist monarchy with a republic. The main influences in this were the Enlightenment in Spain, promoting new ideas, and the Peninsular War that left Spain without a legitimate king after the Abdications of Bayonne. The concept of separation of powers gradually became a tool to prevent despotism. The new political situation generated great political conflict between the cities for two reasons. First, the vacatio regis removed the sovereignty from the King of Spain, but there was no clear view about who and how would be able to claim such sovereignty. Some people thought that it passed to other offices of the Spanish monarchy, while others held the notion of the retroversion of the sovereignty to the people: sovereignty returned to the people, who had now the right to self-governance. The vertical organization of the absolutist monarchy was compromised as well. Patriots thought that all cities, both in Spain and in the Americas, had the right to self-government, whereas Royalists assigned that right only to cities in European Spain, holding that the Americas should stay subject to the new government that Spain would provide. The other source of conflict was the nature of the new governments, which declared themselves to be provisional during the King's absence but were making strong changes in the political organization. Unlike the First Republic of Venezuela, which declared independence early on, the United Provinces were faced with the inconsistency of acting like an independent state without actually having declared such independence. History The United Provinces of the R√≠o de la Plata were established through a lengthy process that started in May 1810, when the citizens and militias of Buenos Aires, the capital city of the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata, ousted the Spanish Viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros in the May Revolution. Although there was not a formal declaration of independence at the time, and the government that emerged from the revolution declared loyalty to the deposed king Ferdinand VII, in fact it attempted to reorganise the social, political and economic structures of the Viceroyalty. As it faced immediate resistance in some quarters (namely the Banda Oriental, under self-proclaimed Viceroy Javier de El√≠o, C√≥rdoba under former Viceroy Santiago de Liniers, the local government of Asunci√≥n in Paraguay and, notably, the royalist forces from the Viceroyalty of Per√∫), the revolution soon turned to be a War of Independence. Battle of Maip√∫, 1819 In the midst of the war of independence, during the entire 1810-1831 period there were serious conflicts among ever-changing factions regarding the organization of the state and the political aims of the revolutionary governments. These conflicts involved coups d'√©tat, mutinies, politically motivated trials, banishments and imprisonments and finally developed into an outright civil war. United Provinces in the 1820s as understood by political cartographers at the time. 1821: '. 1822: The American Atlas by Carey & Lea. 1825: South America by Fisher. =Initial revolutionary governments= Ever since the revolution, there were serious conflicts among diverging views regarding the political organization of the provinces. While some advocated a strong and executive central government with little accountability to the regional interests, a position at first favored by the \\"enlightened\\" revolutionary and independentist elements, others sought to integrate representatives from the provinces in a larger deliberative assembly. As the latter position gained the upper hand, the Primera Junta grew to incorporate delegates from the provinces in 1811. However, as it became evident that such an arrangement was not effective enough to lead the war efforts, a triumvirate assumed executive powers while the assembly retained some controlling functions. =Assembly of the year XIII= 1813 Congress. =Supreme Directorship= =Declaration of independence= =Liga Federal= The Liga Federal (1815‚Äì1820), or Liga de los Pueblos Libres (League of the Free Peoples), was an alliance of provinces in what is now Argentina and Uruguay, organised under democratic federalist ideals strongly advocated by its leader, Jos√© Gervasio Artigas. The government of the United Provinces of South America felt threatened by the growing appeal of the Liga Federal, so they did nothing to repel the incoming Portuguese invasion of Misiones Orientales and the Banda Oriental, the stronghold of Artigas. Brazilian General Carlos Frederico Lecor, thanks to their numerical and material superiority, defeated Artigas and his army and occupied Montevideo on , but the struggle continued for three long years in the countryside. Infuriated by the passivity of Buenos Aires, Artigas declared war on Buenos Aires while he was losing to the Portuguese. On , Federal League governors Francisco Ram√≠rez of Entre R√≠os and Estanislao L√≥pez of Santa Fe, defeated a Supreme Directorship diminished army, ending the centralized government of the United Provinces, and established a federal agreement with Buenos Aires Province. Similarly, the Federal League effectively came to an end when its constituent provinces rejoined the United Provinces. Artigas, defeated by the Portuguese, retreated to Entre R√≠os. From there, he denounced the Treaty of Pilar and entered into conflict with his former ally governor Ram√≠rez, who crushed the remnants of Artigas' army. The former Protector of the Free Peoples was exiled in Paraguay until his death. The Eastern Province was annexed by Portugal to its Brazilian dependences in 1821. =Anarchy of the year XX= =First presidency= =War with Brazil and Independence of Uruguay= =Resumption of the Civil War=  Break up of the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata  The result of the wars was the independence of the provinces.

Pacheco's partner Luis Vernet established a toehold in the islands in 1826 and a fledgling colony in 1828. He also visited the British consulate in 1826, 1828 and 1829 seeking endorsement of his venture and a garrison. In 1829, he sought a naval vessel from the United Provinces to protect his colony but as none were available he was appointed Military and Civil Commander, prompting British protests., p. 209 Attempts to regulate fishing and sealing lead to conflict with the United States and the Lexington raid of 1831., p.106 With the colony in disarray, Major Esteban Mestivier was tasked to set up a penal colony but was murdered in a mutiny shortly after arriving in 1832. Protests at Mestivier's appointment received no response and so the British dispatched a naval squadron to re-establish British rule.

Carson was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2002 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2006. Early life Born in Florence, South Carolina, Carson played at Wilson High School and later at McClenaghan High School, from which he graduated. College career Attended and graduated with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Education in 1976 from South Carolina State University. Before his NFL career, Carson played college football for Willie Jeffries at South Carolina State University from 1972‚Äì1975, not missing a single game in four years. He became the first Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference player to win consecutive defensive player of the year honors, and assisted the Bulldogs to consecutive conference championships. In 1975, he was a first team selection on the AFCA College- Division All-America team and set school records with 117 tackles and 17 sacks. With Carson as their captain, the Bulldogs defense recorded six shutouts in 1975, and held their opponents to just 29 points, an NCAA record for a ten-game season. Carson's Bulldog teammates included future Pittsburgh Steelers and College Football Hall of Fame safety Donnie Shell and future Kansas City Royals first baseman Willie Mays Aikens. In 2002, Carson was enshrined in the College Football Hall of Fame. Professional Football career After his college career, Carson was drafted in the fourth round of the 1976 NFL Draft by the Giants. He spent all of his 13 seasons with them, leading the team in tackles for five seasons, and more impressively, served as their captain for ten. Carson was a member of the Crunch Bunch, a team of fierce linebackers composed of Carson, Brad Van Pelt, Brian Kelley, and Lawrence Taylor. The group is widely considered one of the best defensive combos in NFL history. He was a member of the Big Blue Wrecking Crew defense and also made nine Pro Bowl appearances (1978‚Äì1979, 1981‚Äì1987) in his career. In the 1980s he was joined by Lawrence Taylor, another Pro Football Hall of Fame linebacker. In his 13 seasons, Carson intercepted 11 passes and returned them for a total of 212 yards. He also recovered 14 fumbles, returning them for 36 yards and one touchdown. Officially, he recorded eight quarterback sacks (sacks did not become an official NFL statistic until 1982) but his total is 19 sacks when the 1976‚Äì81 seasons are included. He retired at the end of the 1988 season, two years after helping the team win Super Bowl XXI, the Giants' first, and Carson had seven tackles for the victors. Carson was one of the first practitioners of the \\"Gatorade shower\\" which is when the coach of the winning team is doused with a cooler of Gatorade by some of the players following a win. The practice was started by his teammate Jim Burt in 1985 as Carson recounted in his 1987 book Point of Attack: The Defense Strikes Back. When Bill Parcells had Carson as a player with the Giants, he would have him at his side during the singing of the national anthem for good luck.http://athletes-celebrities.tseworld.com/sports/football/harry-carson.php Bill Belichick, an assistant coach for the Giants for 12 years, who as head coach, led the New England Patriots to six 21st century Super Bowl victories, considered Carson the best all-around linebacker he ever coached. Professional Football Hall of Fame Carson was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2006. His selection came after years of outspoken criticism of the Hall of Fame selection process, where his principal criticism was that the vote is done by the media, not players and coaches. In 2004, Carson asked to have his name taken off the ballot. Despite previously stating that due to his frustration at not being elected he wanted his name removed from the ballot, when elected to the Hall of Fame in 2006 Carson appeared and gave an induction speech. Carson later commented on the selection, saying he was humbled by the selection but noting: > The Hall of Fame will never validate me. I know my name will be in there, > but I take greater pride in the fact that my teammates looked at me as > someone they could count on. I still remember, and I will remember this for > the rest of my life, the Super Bowl against Denver. We had three > captains‚Äîme, Phil Simms and George Martin. But when it came time for the > coin toss before the game, I started to go out and looked around for those > guys. Bill Parcells said to me: 'No. You go. Just you.' And that was about > the coolest feeling I've ever had in the world‚Äîgoing out to midfield for the > Super Bowl, as the lone captain. There were nine Denver Broncos out there, > and me. Just me. An awesome responsibility. The greatest respect. During his Hall of Fame speech in 2006 Harry Carson does not directly mention CTE, but he does mention that he does not think the NFL is doing the best job they can to help out ex-NFL players. When he states \\"I would hope that the leaders of the NFL, the future commissioner, and the player association do a much better job of looking out for those individuals. You got to look out for 'em. If we made the league what it is, you have to take better care of your own\\" (Carson). Carson takes an aggressive stand when it comes to CTE and how the NFL handles their own ex-players that are struggling with head trauma later in their lives. Although Harry Carson was an excellent football player he does suggest that kids not start playing football because of the consequences that could come to them later in life. The NFL reached a concussion settlement of 765 million dollars for the former NFL players that sustained head injuries on the field. When Carson was asked about the settlement in a Frontline interview he says, \\"And so I think everyone now has a better sense of what damage you can get from playing football. And I think the NFL has given everybody 765 million reasons why you don't want to play football\\" (Carson). Harry Carson thinks the huge settlement is good for the former players, but it also scares people away from playing football because of the chances of head trauma players could experience later in life. After football Carson remains in close involvement with the Giants. He has also had a successful career in sports broadcasting and has his own company, Harry Carson Inc., which deals mainly in sports consulting and promotions. Carson was also part-owner of the Arena Football League's New Jersey Red Dogs, alongside ex-Giants Carl Banks and Joe Morris. He currently co-hosts Giants 1st & 10 on Madison Square Garden Network with Bob Papa, Carl Banks and Howard Cross. On May 17, 2015, Harry Carson served as the commencement speaker for New York University School of Professional Studies. Two days later Carson served as the commencement speaker and was presented with an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters Degree from Fairleigh Dickinson University at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. The honor was bestowed upon Carson for his advocacy not only for his football brethren but for anyone who lives with the effects of a traumatic brain injury. Carson simply says \\"I have to speak up for all people who really don't have a voice\\". Carson is a long-time resident of Franklin Lakes, New Jersey.Boburg, Shawn. \\"Harry Carson replaces helmet for Midland Park charity auction\\" , The Record (Bergen County), February 27, 2011. Accessed May 25, 2011. \\"After former Giant and Hall of Famer Harry Carson's donation to a local charity was swiped at a fund-raising event, he was quick to make sure it wasn't the non-profit's loss. The legendary linebacker and Franklin Lakes resident did more than replace the autographed football helmet that mysteriously disappeared at the auction.\\" Health Issues Since his retirement, Carson has lived with various physical maladies brought on by injuries incurred during his playing days. He was diagnosed with post- concussion syndrome in 1990, and estimates that he had 15 concussions during his long high school, college and professional football career. In 1992, he stated: \\"I don't think as clearly as I used to. Nor is my speech, diction, selection of vocabulary is as good as it used to be, and I don't know why.\\"Nack, William. The Wrecking Yard, Sports Illustrated, May 7, 2001, accessed November 23, 2010. In 2001 while he was a broadcaster with the MSG Network he said, \\"I would mispronounce words and lose my train of thought. Things would happen, and at times I'd think I was going crazy.\\" Harry Carson authored his second book \\"Captain for Life\\" published by St. Martin's Press in 2011. In his book he documents his experiences with Post Concussion Syndrome. He was one of the first former professional athletes to share his own personal first hand experiences years before the long term effects of concussions and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), long before the subject became a \\"hot button\\" topic. While Carson has acknowledged he has \\"managed\\" the long term effects of concussions he does not know if he has been affected by chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). When asked, Carson is increasingly critical of the NFL and questions whether football should be played, as he believes the hazards of concussions and subconcussive hits are not an understood risk such as physical ailments are.PBS Frontline \\"League of Denial\\" extended interview He is quoted in this interview as saying of the NFL's $765 million settlement with former players that \\"the NFL has given everybody 765 million reasons why you don't want to play football.\\" In March 2018, Carson joined with former NFL stars Nick Buoniconti and Phil Villapiano to support a parent initiative called Flag Football Under 14, which recommends no tackle football below that age out of a concern for the brain health of the young players. He said, \\"I did not play tackle football until high school, I will not allow my grandson to play until 14, as I believe it is not an appropriate sport for young children.\\"Former NFLers call for end to tackle football for kids, CNN, Nadia Kounang, March 1, 2018.

He played in Major League Baseball as an outfielder, third baseman and first baseman from through , most notably as a member of the Los Angeles Dodgers when he replaced an injured Kirk Gibson in the 1988 World Series and hit .368 (7/19) with two home runs and five RBI to help the Dodgers win the world championship. Early life Hatcher was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and is a graduate of Mesa High School in Mesa, Arizona. Playing career After playing high school baseball for Mesa High School, Hatcher attended Mesa Community College where he was named All-American twice in both football and baseball. His football jersey #81 was later retired. After starring at community college level he attended the University of Oklahoma, where he played both football and baseball and played as wide receiver in the 1976 Fiesta Bowl. He was drafted twice (in 1974 in the 12th round by the Houston Astros and in 1976 in the 2nd round by the New York Mets) before signing with the Dodgers in 1977 (after being selected in the 5th round of the June draft). After signing, Hatcher was assigned as an outfielder to the Clinton Dodgers in the Class A Midwest League. The following season, Hatcher spent time playing for both San Antonio in the Class AA Texas League and AAA Albuquerque. Both stops would see him split time between the outfield and thirdbase ‚Äì presaging his major league career in which he would see time not only at all three outfield positions, but also first and thirdbase. After hitting .371 with 10 home runs, 93 RBI, and 88 runs for Albuquerque, Hatcher made his major league debut on August 3, 1979 subbing in for Ron Cey at 3B. Hatcher was credited with an RBI after taking a bases-loaded walk in the 7th inning. Hatcher would hit .269 in 33 games for the Dodgers in 1979. Hatcher would start the 1980 season knocking around AAA pitching (hitting .359 in 43 games) before again being called up to the parent club. Hatcher would only hit .226 for the Dodgers and despite averaging well over .350 in the minors, his major league stats to date were 2 HR, 10 RBI, 13 runs, and a .249 batting average in 179 plate appearances. On March 30, 1981, the Dodgers traded Hatcher and two minor leaguers to the Minnesota Twins for veteran outfielder Ken Landreaux. He played with the Twins from 1981 to 1986, hitting .284 in 672 games and then returned to the Dodgers as a free agent on April 10, 1987. Mickey Hatcher poses for photo before Dodgers playoff game He is admired for his fun-loving approach to playing baseball, particularly on the World Champion 1988 Dodger team, and was featured in various presentations to the tune of the \\"Mickey Mouse Club\\" song. He would sprint to first base after drawing walks, like Pete Rose, and garnered a lot of media attention in the 1988 World Series by hitting a first-inning home run in Game 1 and sprinting full-speed around the bases instead of jogging. This prompted NBC broadcaster Joe Garagiola to say \\"He's the cover of The Saturday Evening Post!\\" and \\"He's running like he's afraid they're going to take it off the board!\\" Hatcher had only hit one home run in that 1988 season, but hit two in the World Series. Hatcher was famously portrayed on 1986 Fleer and 1991 Upper Deck baseball cards with his \\"giant glove\\". He remained with the Dodgers through 1991, spending his last season back in AAA, before retiring. Coaching career Following his playing days, Hatcher was a coach for the Texas Rangers in 1993 and 1994, the manager of the Rookie League Great Falls Dodgers in 1996 and 1997 and began 1998 as the manager of the Single-A San Bernardino Stampede before becoming the hitting coach for the Dodgers in mid-season. In 2000, he became the hitting coach for the Los Angeles Angels, under manager Mike Scioscia, Hatcher's teammate from the 1988 World Championship team. He was fired by the Angels on May 15, 2012, after the team started the season 16-21. The Dodgers hired Hatcher in June as a special assistant to the General Manager. Hatcher's position was not renewed in 2013.

The barbat or barbud, also sometimes called barbiton, is an unrelated lute-like instrument derived from Persia. The Greek instrument was a bass version of the kithara, and belonged in the zither family, but in medieval times, the same name was used to refer to a different instrument that was a variety of lute. Ancient descriptions Theocritus (xvi. 45), the Sicilian poet, calls the barbitos an instrument of many strings, i.e. more than seven, which was by the Hellenes considered to be a perfect number, and matched the number of strings customary in the kithara. Anacreon (a native of Teos in Asia Minor) sings that his barbitos \\"only gives out erotic tones\\"‚Äìa remark which could have been metaphorical, but could also be a literal reference to the instrument's tuning in the Greek Iastian harmonia. Pollux (Onomasticon iv. chap. 8, ¬ß 59) calls the instrument barbiton or barymite (from Œ≤Œ¨œÅœÖœÇ, heavy and ŒºŒØœÑŒøœÇ, a string), an instrument producing very deep sounds which comes out of the soundbox. The strings were twice as long as those of the pectis and sounded an octave lower. Pindar (in Athen. xiv. p. 635), in the same line wherein he attributes the introduction of the instrument into Greece to Terpander, tells us one could magadize, i.e. play in two parts at an interval of an octave on the two instruments. Although in use in Asia Minor, Italy, Sicily, and Greece, it is evident that the barbiton never won for itself a place in the affections of ancient Greeks; it was regarded as a barbarian instrument affected by those only whose tastes in matters of art were unorthodox. It had fallen into disuse in the days of Aristotle, but reappeared under the Romans. Aristotle said that this string instrument was not for educational purposes but for pleasure only. Often Sappho is also depicted playing the barbitos, which has longer strings and a lower pitch. It is closely associated with the poet Alcaeus and the island of Lesbos, the birthplace of Sappho, where it is called a barmos. The music from this instrument was said to be the lyre for drinking parties and is considered an invention of Terpander. The word barbiton was frequently used for the kithara or lyre. Modern interpretation =Barbitos= In spite of the few meagre shreds of authentic information extant concerning this somewhat elusive instrument, it is possible nevertheless to identify the barbiton as it was known among the Greeks and Romans. From the Greek writers we know that it was a deep toned instrument, with pitch range of at least two octaves, that had enough features in common with the lyra and kithara, to warrant their classification as a family of related instruments. =Barbat= The later, unrelated instrument, is described by the Persians and Arabs as a kind of rebab or lute, or a chelys-lyre, It was first introduced into Europe through Asia Minor by way of Greece, and centuries later into Spain by the Moors, amongst whom it was in the 14th century known as al-barbet. =Third, unnamed, mixed lyre / rebab= Barbiton, from a bas-relief in the Louvre, Achilles at Scyros. Musicologist Kathleen Schlesinger identified a stringed instrument of unknown name that combines the characteristics of both lyre and rebab; It is represented in least four different ancient sculptures: She writes: > It has the vaulted back and gradual narrowing to form a neck which are > typical of the rebab and the stringing of the lyre. In outline it resembles > a large lute with a wide neck, and the seven strings of the lyre of the best > period, or sometimes nine, following the ‚Äúdecadent lyre‚Äù. Most authors in > reproducing these sculptures showing it represent the instrument as boat- > shaped and without a neck, as, for instance, Carl Engel. This is because the > part of the instrument where neck joins body is in deep shadow, so that the > correct outline can hardly be distinguished, being almost hidden by hand on > one side and drapery on the other. The Barbat The barbat (also called ‚Äúbarbiton‚Äù) is unlike the instrument depicted on Greek vase paintings. The Greek barbiton, however, although it underwent many changes, retained until the end the characteristics of the instruments of the Greek kithara whose strings were strummed and plucked, whereas the rebab was sounded by means of the bow at the time of its introduction into Europe. At some period not yet determined, which we can but conjecture, the barbat approximated to the form of the large lute. An instrument called barbiton was known in the early part of the 16th century and during the 17th century. It was a kind of theorbo or bass-lute, but with one neck only, bent back at right angles to form the head. Robert Fludd gives a detailed description of it with an illustration: The people called it theorbo, but the scholar having identified it with the instrument of classic Greece and Rome called it barbiton. The barbiton had nine pairs of gut strings, each pair being in unison. Dictionaries of the 18th century support Fludd's use of the name \\"barbiton\\". G. B. Doni mentions the barbiton, defining it in his index as Barbitos seu major chelys italice tiorba, and deriving it from lyre and cithara in common with testudines, tiorbas and all tortoiseshell instruments. Claude Perrault, writing in the 18th century, states that \\"les modernes appellent notre luth barbiton\\" (the moderns call our lute barbiton). Constantijn Huygens declares that he learnt to play the barbiton in a few weeks, but took two years to learn the cittern. The barbat was a variety of rebab, a bass instrument, differing only in size and number of strings. This is quite in accordance with what we know of the nomenclature of musical instruments among Persians and Arabs, with whom a slight deviation in the construction of an instrument called for a new name. The word barbud applied to the barbiton is said to be derived from a famous musician living at the time of Chosroes II (590-628 CE), who excelled in playing upon the instrument. From a later translation of part of the same author into German we obtain the following reference to Persian musical instruments: :\\"Die S√§nger stehen bei seinem Gastmahl; in ihrer Hand Barbiton(i) und Leyer(ii) und Laute(iii) und Fl√∂te(iv) und Deff (Handpauke)\\". Mr. Ellis, of the Oriental Department of the British Museum, has kindly supplied the original Persian names translated above, i.e. (i) barbut, (ii) chang, (iii) rubƒÅb, (iv) nei. The barbut and rubab thus were different instruments as late as the 19th century in Persia. There were but slight differences if any between the archetypes of the pear- shaped rebab and of the lute before the application of the bow to the former - both had vaulted backs, body and neck in one, and gut strings plucked by the fingers. Modern reconstruction The barbitos is part of the Lost Sounds Orchestra, alongside other ancient instruments which Ancient Instruments Sound/Timbre Reconstruction Application (ASTRA) have recreated the sounds of, including the epigonion, the salpinx, the aulos, and the syrinx. The sounds of the barbitos are being digitally recreated by the ASTRA project, which uses Physical modeling synthesis to simulate the barbitos sounds. Due to the complexity of this process the ASTRA project uses grid computing, to model sounds on hundreds of computers throughout Europe simultaneously.

In this case, the southern terminus is the intersection of Alton Road and Fifth Street (SR A1A), and the northern terminus is the intersection of 63rd Street and Collins Avenue (SR A1A). Alton Road snakes up the western (Biscayne Bay) side of the barrier islands comprising Miami Beach, while Collins Avenue parallels the Atlantic shore to the east. In addition, SR 907 is often used as a bypass for the oft-congested SR A1A. Alton Road has seen early ripples of sea level rise caused by global warming.Miami Finds Itself Ankle-Deep in Climate Change Debate May 7, 2014 NYT Route description Alton Road southbound at the Interstate 195 interchange State Road 907 begins at the intersection of State Road A1A and Alton Road. Motorists heading east on SR A1A from Miami can use a left turn lane on SR A1A to access the southern terminus of SR 907. SR 907 heads north as Alton Road, through South Beach, as a commercial County fair, staying within 1-3 blocks east of Biscayne Bay. Two blocks south of Dade Boulevard, SR 907 reaches the westernmost end of Lincoln Road Mall, one of America's first open-air pedestrian shopping centers. It leaves South Beach north of the Dade Boulevard intersection and two blocks later, crosses Michigan Avenue, where Alton Road becomes a residential street. It then curves slightly west before continuing north, and passes by the western end of the Miami Beach Country Club. At the northwest end of the golf club, SR 907 crosses a canal and briefly branches off Alton Road, which becomes SR 907A, and heads through a bypass west of Alton Road. The bypass provides direct access to I-195 west and the Mount Sinai Medical Center. At the hospital's main entrance, SR 907 rejoins Alton Road, and continues north through residential streets, continuing to curve northeast and crossing another canal just north of the Miami Heat Stadium. At the northern end of the canal, SR 907 passes through the western end of the La Gorce Golf Course. At the northern end of the golf course, SR 907 leaves Alton Road and becomes W 63rd Street, crossing two more canals and intersecting with SR A1A again to end its route. History Upon completion of State Road 112 (Interstate 195) in 1961, a bypass section of Alton Road near Mount Sinai Medical Center was constructed just west of Alton Road for direct access between the hospital and the limited access highway. The road was originally signed as State Road 945 in 1980. Three years later, SR 945 became SR 907. Major intersections Related route State Road 907A (SR 907A) is a section of Alton Road, running parallel to the bypass section of SR 907, running near I-195. SR 907A starts at Alton Road, just north of a canal crossing, at 34th Street. SR 907A heads straight north, with SR 907 taking the bypass route to the west. Alton Road heads through a commercial area, intersecting with I-195's eastern terminus and State Road 112 three blocks from its southern terminus. Alton Road continues north through a residential area, intersecting with its northern terminus of SR 907 at the Mount Sinai Medical Center entrance. While motorists going westbound on SR 112 see trailblazer signs for SR 907A (one noting \\"JCT 907A\\" and two directional trailblazers a half block from Alton Road), those are the only indications of the existence of the north-south state road. In 1980, the branch of Alton Road that ran east of the bypass near I-195/SR 112 was designated SR 945A. Three years later, it became SR 907A.

This peak is named in honor of Scottish-born John Muir, a famous geologist, conservationist and founder of the Sierra Club. The southernmost section of the John Muir Trail contours along the west side of Mount Muir near its summit and ends on the summit of Mount Whitney. Climbing Among mountain climbers, a peak needs to meet certain criteria in order to be included in some lists. To be listed as an independent peak a summit must have of clean prominence. A reliable source gives Mount Muir's clean prominence as 298feet, and so the peak does not qualify for lists of fourteeners based on elevation and prominence. It is included in other lists which do not depend on promince. Some lists are based on more subjective criteria and Mount Muir is included in the Sierra Peaks Section list, the Western States Climbers list. and the Vulgarian Ramblers, 13,800-Footers of the Contiguous USA list. The easiest approach is from the John Muir Trail just north of its junction with the Mount Whitney Trail in Sequoia National Park. The trail passes very near the summit and the climb involves a short stretch of difficult scrambling up the steep, boulder-strewn, western slope to the summit block, (). A dayhike permit or a backcountry permit with a Whitney Zone stamp is required to hike the Mount Whitney Trail. The east side of Mount Muir, which is in the John Muir Wilderness, is a near-vertical cliff about high.

History  The location of Saga Castle was originally a fortified village under the control of the Ry≈´z≈çji clan, warlords of a small area of northern Ky≈´sh≈´ in the Muromachi period. After Ry≈´z≈çji Takanobu was defeated by a coalition of Shimazu and Arima forces in 1584, his retainer Nabeshima Naoshige gained control of the castle. Naoshige allied the clan with Toyotomi Hideyoshi and gained personal distinction during the Japanese invasions of Korea, during which time he befriended noted castle architect Kat≈ç Kiyomasa and future Sh≈çgun Tokugawa Ieyasu. Following the Battle of Sekigahara, the Nabeshima clan was confirmed in its holdings in Hizen province, and Naoshige‚Äôs son, Nabeshima Katsushige became 1st daimy≈ç of Saga Domain. Naoshige began work on rebuilding the castle with the approval of the Tokugawa Shogunate beginning in 1602, with the work completed under Katsushige by 1611. The original structure included a five-storey donjon surrounded by a system of 80-metre wide moats. Unusually, the moats are not surmounted by stone walls, but by earthen ramparts tall enough to conceal the inner fortifications. These ramparts were also planted with pine and camphor trees for additional concealment, which lent the castle its nickname. The reconstructed main keep. A fire in 1726 destroyed most of the castle structures, including the donjon. The palace portion was restored two years later in the outer bailey, which was the centre of the Saga domain government for most of the Edo period. Another fire occurred in 1835, after which the buildings were reconstructed by Saga domain‚Äôs final daimy≈ç Nabeshima Naomasa. After the Meiji Restoration, the castle remained the location for the local government offices. However, the castle was occupied in 1874 by former politician and samurai Et≈ç Shinpei and his following of disgruntled samurai in the Saga Rebellion. The rebels were defeated by military force, during which most of the buildings in the castle were burned down. Since 1874, the castle grounds have been used as the site for a court building and a prefectural office, and in 1883 it became a junior school. The buildings were eventually replaced by modern school buildings. In 1953, one of the surviving gates of the castle was proclaimed a Saga Prefectural Important Cultural Property (PICP). It gained national protection (ICP) in 1957. From 2001 to 2004 the main portion of the castle was restored. It is now houses the Saga Castle History Museum and is the largest wooden castle reconstruction in Japan.

He was a follower of the Karma Mimamsa school of philosophy and a staunch defender of the holistic sphota doctrine of language. He was a contemporary of Adi Shankara, and is said to have become a disciple of Adi Sankara. Ma·πá·∏çana Mi≈õra's wife was Ubhaya Bharati. He is often identified with Sure≈õvara, though some scholars have questioned authenticity of such claims. Life =Scholarship= Ma·πá·∏çana Mi≈õra was born to a humble family in Mithila (present day Bihar), and lived in the ancient village of Mahishi located in Mithila during the time of Adi Sankara. The location of Mahishi is at district of Saharsa in Bihar. Ma·πá·∏çana Mi≈õra reportedly lived in the present day Mandleshwar and debated with Shankarachaarya at the Gupteshwar Mahadev Temple. The said town supposedly derives its name after him. Ma·πá·∏çana Mi≈õra is known to be a student of a mimamsa scholar Kumarila Bhatta, but who also wrote a work on Advaita, the Brahma-siddhi. Ma·πá·∏çana Mi≈õra is best known as the author of the Brahmasiddhi. Being a follower of the Karma Mimamsa school, he was a ritualist and performed all of the ritualistic duties prescribed by the Vedas. In certain Hindu traditions, Ma·πá·∏çana Mi≈õra is considered to be an incarnation of Brahma. Sure≈õvara has also been credited as the founder of a pre-Shankara branch of Advaita Vedanta. =Conversion to Advaita Vedanta= A strong tradition in Hinduism being that he started life as a Mƒ´mƒÅmsaka, but changed his name and became a sannyƒÅsin and an Advaitin after Ma·πá·∏çana Mi≈õra and his wife were defeated by Shankara in a debate. =Identification with Sure≈õvara= Ma·πá·∏çana Mi≈õra has often been identified with Sure≈õvara. Sure≈õvara (fl. 800-900 CE) and Ma·πá·∏çana Mi≈õra were contemporaries of Shankara. Both explained Sankara \\"on the basis of their personal convictions.\\" According to Kuppuswami Sastri, it is not likely that Ma·πá·∏çana Mi≈õra, the author of Brahmasiddhi, is identical with Sure≈õvara, but the tradition is correct in describing Ma·πá·∏çana Mi≈õra and ≈öankara as contemporaries. His critical edition of the Brahmasiddhi also points out that the name Ma·πá·∏çana Mi≈õra is both a title and a first name, which is a possible cause for a confusion of personalities. Ma·πá·∏çana Mi≈õra's brand of Advaita differs in certain critical details from that of ≈öhankara, whereas Sure≈õvara's thought is very faithful to that of ≈öhankara. According to Sharma, Hiriyanna and Kuppuswami Sastra have pointed out that Sure≈õvara and Ma·πá·∏çana Mi≈õra had different views on various doctrinal points: * The locus of avidya: according to Ma·πá·∏çana Mi≈õra, the individual jiva is the locus of avidya, whereas Suresvara contents that avidya regarding Brahman is located in Brahman. These two different stances are also reflected in the opposing positions of the Bhamati school and the Vivarana school. * Liberation: according to Ma·πá·∏çana Mi≈õra, the knowledge which arises from the Mahavakya is insufficient for liberation. Only the direct realization of Brahma is liberating, which can only be attained by meditation. According to Suresvara, this knowledge is directly liberating, while meditation is at best a useful aid. Influence Ma·πá·∏çana Mi≈õra, who was a contemporary of Shankara, may have been more influential in the Advaita Vedanta tradition than is usually acknowledged. According to Richard E. King, According to King and Roodurmun, until the 10th century Sankara was overshadowed by his older contemporary Ma·πá·∏çana Mi≈õra. In the centuries after Sankara it was Ma·πá·∏çana Mi≈õra who was considered to be the most important representative of Vedanta. His influence was such, that some regard this work to have \\"set forth a non- Sankaran brand of Advaita.\\" The \\"theory of error\\" set forth in the Brahma- siddhi became the normative Advaita Vedanta theory of error. Vachaspati Mi≈õra Bhamati provides the link between Mandana Mi≈õra and Shankara, attempting to harmonise Sankara's thought with that of Mandana Mi≈õra.THE BHAMATI AND VIVARANA SCHOOLS According to Advaita tradition, Shankara reincarnated as Vachaspati Mi≈õra \\"to popularise the Advaita System through his Bhamati.\\" Debate with Adi Shankara Many biographies of Shankara describe how Ma·πá·∏çana Mi≈õra is said to have first met Adi Shankara. It was customary in the time of Shankara and Ma·πá·∏çana for learned people to debate the relative merits and demerits of the different systems of Hindu philosophy. Shankara, an exponent of Advaita philosophy sought out Kumarila Bhatta, who was the leading exponent of the Purva Mimamsa philosophy. However, at that time, Kumarila Bhatta was slowly immolating himself as a penance for his sins. After reading some of Shankara's work and realising the depth of his knowledge, he directed Sankara to his greatest disciple, Ma·πá·∏çana Mi≈õra, who was leading a householder's life (Grihastha), to debate the merits of their respective schools of thought. While trying to find the house of Ma·πá·∏çana, Sankara asked for directions and was told the following: Shankara found Ma·πá·∏çana, but the first meeting between them was not pleasant. According to Vedic ritualistic rules it is inauspicious to see an ascetic on certain days and Ma·πá·∏çana was angered to see Shankara, an ascetic, on the death anniversary of his father. Ma·πá·∏çana initially hurled insults at Shankara, who calmly replied to every insult with wordplay. The people in Ma·πá·∏çana's house soon realised Sankara's brilliance and advise Ma·πá·∏çana to offer his respect. Finally, after a verbal duel, Ma·πá·∏çana agreed to debate with Shankara. Ma·πá·∏çana and Sankara agreed that Ma·πá·∏çana's wife Ubhaya Bharati, who is considered to be an incarnation of the goddess Saraswati in the folklore of Mithila, would be the arbiter for the debate, and that the vanquished would become a disciple of the victor and accept his school of thought. The debate spanned many days and ranged across many different subjects within the Vedas, and the arguments of both competitors were compelling and forceful. Sankara finally emerged victorious. But Ma·πá·∏çana's wife, who was the judge, would not accept an ascetic as having complete knowledge since he did not have any knowledge about Kama sastras (rules about marital life). Sankara was then given six months to research certain aspects of sex-love sciences and then resume the debate. According to legend, he entered into the body of a king who had just died to learn these sciences. Later, after obtaining the necessary knowledge, the debate resumed. After a long debate, Ma·πá·∏çana accepted defeat.It is also a legend that the place of debate between Shankaracharya and Mandanmishra, was the town Mandleshwar near Maheshwar. The ancient temple Chhapan Deo of this town is considered to be this place. As agreed, Ma·πá·∏çana becomes a disciple of Sankara and assumed the name Suresvaracharya. Along with Hastamalaka, PadmapƒÅda, and Totakacharya, he was one of the four main disciples of Sankara and was the first head of Sringeri Mutt, one of the four mathas that Shankara later established. Ma·πá·∏çana Mi≈õra reportedly debated with Aadya Guru Shankarachaarya at the Gupteshwar Mahadev Temple in Mandleshwar.

History The land within the park's boundaries is among the most historic in Los Gatos. The grantees of the \\"Rancho Rinconada de Los Gatos\\", Jose Hernandez and Sebastian Peralta, constructed an adobe house on what is now one of the park's lawns. It was the first structure built in the area. The narrow gauge South Pacific Coast Railroad once traversed the western edge of the park en route to downtown and over the Santa Cruz Mountains to Felton and Monterey Bay at Santa Cruz Wharf. The Southern Pacific Railroad later acquired the South Pacific Coast Railroad and converted the line to standard gauge after the turn of the century. A farmer near Pollard Road, Albert August Vollmer, contacted the Southern Pacific asking for a flag stop to be established to allow a more convenient place to board the train. The railroad not only agreed, but allowed him to name the stop. He chose the name \\"Vasona\\", which was the name of his favorite pony during his childhood. \\"Vasona Junction\\" was the point on the line where the tracks split off from the San Jose-Campbell-Los Gatos mainline with the Vasona Branch through the Cupertino Hills to Palo Alto, allowing more direct travel to San Francisco. The name \\"Vasona\\" has reappeared locally ever since, including in the naming of the park. The dam was completed in 1934, and the railroad continued to run along the Western side of the reservoir until 1959. The railroad right-of-way over the reservoir is now University Avenue. Billy Jones Railroad in Vasona Lake Park (2016) After the death of Southern Pacific engineer Billy Jones in 1968, a volunteer-led movement secured part of the park's southern end for the reconstructed, gauge Billy Jones Wildcat Railroad, a miniature railway which Jones ran around his prune orchard on Winchester Boulevard and Daves Avenue. The depot and engine house, concessions and souvenir stand, and W.E. \\"Bill\\" Mason Carousel are all in Oak Meadow Park, a short walk from adjacent Vasona Park. The railroad operates weekends year- round as well as daily during school summer vacations. Steam locomotive No. 2, 100 years old in 2005, was once again made operable after being reboilered over the course of about a decade. The carousel building also houses a custom built band organ that plays from Wurlitzer 150 rolls. The organ was extensively rebuilt and upgraded to include a MIDI interface in 2012.

Formerly Calvary Bible College, the institution opened in 1932 and offers several associate and bachelor's degrees, including an adult degree completion program and online programs. Master of Science degrees in Organization Development, Music and Education are offered in the Graduate School, and Master of Arts, Master of Divinity, and Doctor of Philosophy degrees in Bible and Theology are offered in the Seminary. Fall 2018 total enrollment was 346, with undergraduate enrollment of 275 and graduate enrollment of 71. History Calvary University is a result of a merger in 1961 between two small Bible colleges‚ÄîKansas City Bible College (est. 1932) and Midwest Bible College (est. 1938) in St. Louis. The two schools moved to a campus in the Kansas City suburban community of Prairie Village, Kansas, and became Calvary Bible College. A second merger took place in 1987 when Citadel Bible College of Ozark, Arkansas, joined Calvary. In 1966, Calvary moved to 1111 West 39th Street in Kansas City, where it remained until 1980. It then moved to its current campus at the former Richards-Gebaur Air Force Base. James L. Clark became President in 2009. In 2012, the campus expanded across the street to 13 acres vacated by the US Marines and awarded to the school by the US Department of Education, which included a move-in ready dorm and three other buildings for new offices, classrooms, and space for chapel. Clark retired in 2016 and Christopher Cone was named president. In mid-2016, Calvary rebranded as Calvary University. On March 11, 2020, Calvary released a fundraising plea disclosing that the school did not have sufficient funds to pay upcoming bills over the following summer, even after significant budget cuts, including reducing the number of staff and faculty by 15%.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg0r57lrhis President Cone departed from Calvary in May 2020.

It travels through the southeastern part of the state, nicknamed Little Dixie. SH-1 is signed east and west. Route description =Madill to Ada= The beginning of SH-1, just north of the junction with US-177/SH-199 SH-1 eastbound begins at US-177/SH-199 between Mannsville and Madill. It then winds northward to the town of Ravia, and becomes concurrent with SH-7 at through Mill Creek. Highway 7 splits off to the west soon after and SH-1 continues northward to Hickory, Oklahoma and Roff. In Fitzhugh SH-1 becomes a multilane highway. It then becomes a freeway serving as part of a beltway around Ada. Through Ada it is briefly concurrent with US-377/SH-99. =Ada to Calvin= After leaving Ada the highway becomes gradually more hilly and curvy, and turns northeast. Between the towns of Allen and Calvin, the road roughly follows the south bank of the Canadian River, though the river is not actually visible from the road. At Calvin, the road becomes concurrent with US-270 and intersects with US-75. =Calvin to Talihina= Through some parts of this section of the highway, the SH-1 signage is omitted in favor of US-270 signs. Continuing east, the highway passes just north of Stuart, Oklahoma and through Arpelar. It then intersects with the Indian Nation Turnpike just west of the McAlester city limits. Through McAlester the street is also signed as Carl Albert Parkway. East of McAlester the road continues as a four-lane road (much of it divided) connecting many small towns east of the city: Krebs, Alderson, Bache, Dow, Haileyville, and Hartshorne. West of Hartshorne US-270 splits off from SH-1 and it continues east concurrent with SH-63. For SH-1 and SH-63 overlap State Highway 2. Here the road continues east and becomes even more hilly and curvy as it heads toward the Winding Stair Mountains. From this point forward, the road contains a large number of hairpin turns - some even as drastic as 180-degrees. At Talihina SH-63 splits off to the south and US-271 merges on to the highway for . =The Talimena Drive= Le Flore County. thumb 8 miles (12.8 km) northeast of Talihina, SH-1 splits off of US-271. This begins the final 26 miles (41 km) of the highway, officially named the Talimena Drive because it runs from Talihina to Mena, Arkansas. This highway, a National Scenic Byway since January 2005, runs through the Ouachita National Forest and the Winding Stair Mountains, and has no shoulders. It features special 'vistas' - parking lots placed off the road at especially scenic parts of the highway. At either end of the Talimena Drive, signs are posted stating that the highway is closed during cold and foggy conditions, and that no snow control is provided. The height of the mountain peaks on the Drive causes the oaks and pines to grow so much slower and shorter than the rest of Southeast Oklahoma. On a hot summer day, the winds on the Talimena Drive may be a good 10 degrees cooler than other nearby locations. SH-1 ends at the Arkansas state line. The roadbed continues on as Highway 88, toward Queen Wilhelmina State Park and the city of Mena, Arkansas. History State Highway 1 was historically an entrance into Indian Territory from the state of Arkansas. The Oklahoma Choctaw came to these mountain tops in the early 1830s. Stage coach robbers, train robbers and bank robbers all came to hide on these mountain peaks bringing in their horses for much needed breaks. Horse Thief Springs is marked at its vista where one can still rest before continuing down the Drive. SH-1 is the latest of many Oklahoma state highways assigned the number 1. The current route opened in 1969. In this case, the number 1 was assigned due to the scenery along the highway.

The organization was created in 1910 as the Association canadienne-fran√ßaise d'√âducation de l'Ontario (ACF√âO) to lobby for French language education rights in the province. The organization and the Franco-Ontarian community at large faced a serious early crisis when the provincial government adopted Regulation 17 in 1912, effectively banning the teaching of French in schools. The regulation was never fully implemented because of ACF√âO's litigation, and it was eventually repealed in 1927. ACF√âO subsequently changed its name to Association canadienne-fran√ßaise de l'Ontario (\\"Association of French Canadians of Ontario\\"), or ACFO. The organization continued to lobby for the improvement of French language services in the province. It was instrumental in the adoption of the French Language Services Act in 1986, and in the creation of Ontario's three francophone colleges: Coll√®ge La Cit√© in Ottawa, Coll√®ge Bor√©al in Sudbury and the defunct Coll√®ge des Grands-Lacs in Toronto. As well, ACFO lobbied against the provincial government's planned closure of Ottawa's Montfort Hospital. In 2004, the organization changed its name to L'Assembl√©e de la francophonie de l'Ontario, partly to reflect Canadian francophones' modern shift away from identifying as French Canadian. In 2010 / 2011, their revenue was 1.4 million dollars. 1.2 million of that came from various government entities. The organization's current president is Carol Jolin.

The widow Judith first charms the Syrian general Holofernes, then decapitates him in his tent. The painting was rediscovered in 1950 and is part of the collection of the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica in Rome. The recent exhibition 'Dentro Caravaggio' Palazzo Reale, Milan (Sept 2017-Jan 2018), suggests a date of 1602 on account of the use of light underlying sketches not seen in Caravaggio's early work but characteristic of his later works. The exhibition catalogue (Skira, 2018, p88) also cites biographer artist Giovanni Baglione's account that the work was commissioned by Genoa banker Ottavio Costa. A second painting on the exact same subject (see below) and dated to 1607, attributed by several experts to Caravaggio but still disputed by others, was rediscovered by chance in 2014 and went on sale in June 2019 as \\"Judith and Holofernes\\".  Subject  The deuterocanonical Book of Judith tells how Judith served her people by seducing and pleasuring Holofernes, the Syrian General. Judith gets Holofernes drunk, then seizes her sword and slays him: \\"Approaching to his bed, she took hold of the hair of his head\\" (). Caravaggio's approach was, typically, to choose the moment of greatest dramatic impact: the moment of decapitation itself. The figures are set out in a shallow stage, theatrically lit from the side, isolated against the inky black background. Judith's maid Abra stands beside her mistress to the right as Judith extends her arm to hold a blade against Holofernes's neck; lying on his stomach, neck contorted as he turns his head towards his assassin, he is vulnerable. X-rays have revealed that Caravaggio adjusted the placement of Holofernes' head as he proceeded, separating it slightly from the torso and moving it minutely to the right. The faces of the three characters demonstrate the artist's mastery of emotion, Judith's countenance in particular showing a mix of determination and repulsion. Artemisia Gentileschi and others were deeply influenced by this work; while they even surpassed Caravaggio's physical realism, it has been argued that none matched his capture of Judith's psychological ambivalence.Catherine Puglisi, Caravaggio (Phaidon, 1998) pp. 137‚Äì138 The model for Judith is probably the Roman courtesan Fillide Melandroni, who posed for several other works by Caravaggio around this year; the scene itself, especially the details of blood and decapitation, were presumably drawn from his observations of the public execution of Beatrice Cenci in 1599.Peter Robb, M: The Caravaggio Enigma (Duffy and Snellgrove, 1998), p. 96 Possible second version When Caravaggio left Naples on 14 June 1607, he left two paintings - the Madonna of the Rosary and Judith beheading Holofernes - in the studio in Naples that was shared by the two Flemish painters and art dealers Louis Finson and Abraham Vinck. Vinck likely took the two paintings with him when he left Naples and settled in Amsterdam around 1609. Later Finson also moved to Amsterdam. The two paintings are mentioned again, this time in the will and testament dated 19 September 1617 prepared by Finson in Amsterdam. In his will Finson left Vinck his share in the two Caravaggio paintings that they had owned in common since Naples. Finson died shortly after making his will and his heir Vinck died two years later. After Vinck died his heirs sold the Madonna of the Rosary after 1619 for 1800 florins to a committee of Flemish painters and 'amateurs' led by Peter Paul Rubens for the Saint Paul's Church of the Dominican friars in Antwerp.Report written by Nicola Spinosa on the Toulouse Caravaggio In 1786, Emperor Joseph II of Austria first ordered the closure of all 'useless' monastic orders and then claimed the other painting by Caravaggio for his art collection. It can now be admired in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. Caravaggio's work, which was a gift of Antwerp's leading artists and an expression of their deep religious devotion had thus become the object of looting by the Austrian rulers of Flanders.Caravaggio en de St.Paulus There was no trace of the second Caravaggio representing Judith beheading Holofernes co-owned by Vinck and Finson since the early 1600s. It was suggested that it should be identified with the painting in the collection of the Intesa Sanpaolo bank in Naples. A painting of Judith beheading Holofernes discovered in an attic in Toulouse in 2014 is believed by certain scholars to be the lost Caravaggio. Other scholars see in both the Toulouse Judith and the work in the collection of the Intesa Sanpaolo bank not only works painted by the hand of Finson but they have also contended that they are in fact original creations of Finson rather than copies after a lost Caravaggio. The Toulouse version has even been described as Finson's masterpiece. Both camps of art historians base their attribution on the stylistic and technical features of the work.Olivier Morand, Le Finson de Toulouse, 2019 An export ban was placed on the painting by the French government while tests were carried out to establish its authenticity. In February 2019 it was announced that the painting would be sold at auction after the Louvre had turned down the opportunity to purchase it for ‚Ç¨100 million. It was instead bought by art collector and hedge fund manager J.Tomilson Hill for an undisclosed amount of money shortly before the planned auction, in June 2019.

The quartet consisted of teenagers Ray David (Raymond David Henriksen), Erik Kinn (Knut Eirik Kokkin), Kif Flinder (Christopher Flinder Petersen) and Chris Jensen (Christoffer Jensen).  History  Originally put together by the label Tribe Records (NO) who was looking to build a group around young Henriksen whom they knew from several stage performances. In January 2002 an audition was made in the regions around Oslo, looking for boys who could sing but with an emphasis on dancing abilities. Out of several hundred hopefuls Kokkin, Petersen and Jensen were chosen. Many months of hard work followed, grooming the boys into what would become Norway's first boyband, with Henriksen as the main vocalist. The origin of the band name came from the boys themselves. From the beginning they would often keep in touch through text messages, and used to end their messages with \\"c u l8r\\" (see you later), and thus the band name was born. L8R described itself as \\"metal pop\\" and their music and style was tougher than what one normally expected from boybands. This became evident with their debut single in 2003, Back in Black, a cover of the classic AC/DC-song. Debuting at #4 on VG-lista, Norway's official music chart, it quickly sold to gold. Extensive touring and promoting followed, as well as two more singles; World of Pain and most notably In Da House. The latter produced by Swedish industrial rap metal group Clawfinger and based on their old hit The Truth. It reached #2 on the Norwegian charts and it too sold gold. October 27, 2003, saw the release of their first and only album, Enter the Dragon. L8R's tough image seemed to work well with kids around their own age, especially with girls in their early teens. The boys were also given credit for their well-rehearsed stage shows and continued to perform around Norway well into 2004. In July of that same year group member Petersen, an aspiring dancer, got into a prominent dance academy in Oslo and decided to leave the band. With the friendship being very tight-knit in the group, the other boys would not continue without their fourth member and they chose to split up. Today Petersen concentrates on his dancing, but the other three boys still keep in touch.

The photographer simply pushed a button on the lens for it to focus automatically. Canon used a similar autofocus system for the FD mount Canon T80 of 1985, which had a range of three lenses with integral autofocus electronics and motors. However, the T80's lenses could only autofocus when mounted on the T80. Canon abandoned further development of autofocus for the FD mount in favour of the totally new and incompatible Canon EOS system in 1987.

It is on the west side of downtown, bounded by Broadway to the east, I-35 to the west, 7th Street to the north, and 14th Street to the south. The Kansas border is half a mile away through the West Bottoms. Since 1978, Quality Hill has been listed as an historic district on the National Register of Historic Places. Today, it includes residences, large businesses (including the headquarters of Kansas City Southern Industries and DST Systems and a large branch of the State Street Corporation), retail establishments, entertainment venues, two cathedrals, and private clubs. History Situated within fourteen blocks of the Missouri River, Quality Hill is the oldest established residential area in the Kansas City metropolitan area to remain continuously inhabited. =French origins= The Chouteau Society, a society dedicated to highlighting Kansas City's French origins, erected a signpost at the northwest corner of 11th and Washington streets, in French and English, which states the corner was the site of an early-18th-century French missionary church, the oldest structure known to have been built by Europeans in the region. This would have been during the era of French fur trappers who traveled the region's rivers. The first recorded church on the site was built in 1822 at the behest of Fran√ßois Chouteau, who is credited as the founder and first Euro-American permanent settler of Kansas City.Berenice and Francois Chouteau from Kansas City Public Library site The Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception - History and Renovation Today, the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph, is on the site of Chouteau's church. Known for its gold-covered dome, the cathedral is the oldest standing building on Quality Hill. Two blocks down Washington Street is Grace and Holy Trinity Cathedral, which was built beginning in the 1860s, and serves as the seat of the Episcopal Diocese of West Missouri. Several buildings on Quality Hill date to before the Civil War. =Lewis and Clark Expedition= On September 15, 1806, the Lewis and Clark Expedition stopped on what is now known as Quality Hill, on its return from the Pacific Ocean. Meriwether Lewis noted in his journal that the site offered a \\"commanding situation for a fort.\\" Today, the site is commemorated by a large bronze sculpture including a figure of the enslaved man York, the only monument in Missouri to include a slave. Informational signposts and a lookout point are at the north end of Case Park, located at 8th Street and Jefferson Street. The sculpture was made by Eugene Daub. =Quality Hill's heyday= Between its formal inception as a neighborhood by Kersey Coates in 1857 and a short time after the end of World War I, Quality Hill was the most fashionable and expensive neighborhood in Kansas City. Many of the city's leaders of power and industry lived high on Quality Hill's limestone bluffs in large houses overlooking the West Bottoms below, which contained the city's industrial heart, rail center, and famous stockyards. From Quality Hill they had ready access to their businesses and to the ports of commerce. The Progress Club, a Jewish gentlemen's club, was founded in 1881 on Quality Hill, where it remained until 1928; today, the building houses the local YMCA One figure who greatly influenced Quality Hill's rise was Tom Pendergast, a notorious political boss in the city. In the early 20th century, his brother, Jim Pendergast, a saloon owner in the West Bottoms, began a Democratic Party political machine which soon achieved nearly total power over politics in the region. His chief rival was Joe Shannon. Shannon's faction was nicknamed \\"the rabbits\\" because of their connection to the old ways of doing things in lowlands along the rivers (one of the early nicknames for Kansas City was \\"Rabbitville\\"), while the Pendergast faction was nicknamed \\"the goats\\" because of their desire to climb out of the Bottoms. Tom Pendergast succeeded his brother as boss of the machine. In 1941, Pendergast arranged for President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Works Progress Administration to build a large park on Quality Hill overlooking the Kansas City Downtown Airport, which also was built during his reign. This park is known as Case Park today, occupying the entire edge of Quality Hill's bluffs. Tom Pendergast commissioned a statue of his brother Jim to be placed in the park, and it still stands. Until the completion of Kansas City International Airport in 1972, Case Park was a popular spot to watch planes take off from the Downtown Airport. One consideration in the decision to build the new airport was the difficulty planes encountered taking off from the Downtown airport, as they had to climb steeply to avoid the 200-foot bluffs and Quality Hill's buildings. The Kansas City Riverfront Bicycle Trail, a 20-mile bicycle route along the Missouri River around downtown Kansas City, also runs through the park and along the bluff. The River Club, founded in 1948 as an exclusive gentlemen's club on Quality Hill In 1953, the American Hereford Association placed a fiberglass statue of a bull on a 90-foot pylon at its headquarters at 715 Kirk Drive, with President Dwight D. Eisenhower presiding. The bull was nicknamed \\"Bob\\" by locals, a name derived from the acronym created by the phrase \\"bull on building.\\" It either was loved as an icon or reviled as kitsch detracting from the city's beauty. The statue's sculptor was Will Decker with Rochetti and Parzini of New York City, and it was manufactured at the Colonial Plastic Corporation of Newark, New Jersey. =Decline and redevelopment= Statue of Jim Pendergast in Case Park overlooking the West Bottoms Beginning in the 1960s, Downtown Kansas City's population began a steep decline. The city's center of population moved south to the suburbs. Elite who used to live on Quality Hill gradually moved to upscale areas farther south, such as the Country Club Plaza and Sunset Hill. As a result, houses were divided into multiple families, income levels of residents went down, and Quality Hill gradually fell into extreme disrepair. In the early 1970s, Arnold Garfinkel, a real estate developer, began acquiring and assembling properties and by 1976, he controlled several large parcels. Garfinkle created a report promoting the investment possibilities on Quality Hill. He envisioned a combination of new development and historic renovation. Garfinkel did not implement his ambitious plan, but it served as a catalyst for other investors, who began renovations on several loft buildings. These new developments encouraged the Kansas City LCRA, in 1983, to revise the downtown central business district plan to include the revitalization of the Quality Hill area.http://krex.k-state.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/2097/23814/LD2668R4PLAN1987D53.pdf?sequence=1 That same year, LCRA selected McCormack Baron Salazar, a development company from St. Louis with strong historic preservation experience, to serve as master developer for the effort. The City, in partnership with the neighborhood and a consortium of the Hall Family Foundation, DST Systems, J.E. Dunn and others, acquired nearly all of Quality Hill from Garfinkle and others. McCormack Baron Salazar, as developer, built many new structures, both residential and commercial, and refurbished old ones. In the 1990s, the architecture firm HNTB bought the American Hereford building for its world headquarters and removed the bull statue from the building. In 2002, HNTB and other firms arranged to have the bull moved across I-35 to Mulkey Square. In 2004, Kansas City Southern Industries completed a multimillion-dollar new headquarters between the two cathedrals and designed after Quality Hill's distinctive architectural style. Around that time, State Street purchased Quality Hill property from DST Systems and opened a major branch. The Heart of America United Way (the Kansas City Metropolitan Area branch of the United Way) also maintains its headquarters in the heart of Quality Hill, in the former Virginia Hotel and in a 19th-century house along Pennsylvania street. Previously it was also located in a 19th-century house on the corner of Washington Street and 11th Street. In 2016, that location was converted into Quality Hill Academy, a local charter school for grades K-3. Today An entrance to Kansas City's Quality Hill neighborhood. Since the late 20th century, Quality Hill has regained its attraction as a highly upscale urban neighborhood. According to Tony Salazar, it is widely regarded as one of the best successes in urban renewal in the United States. Quality Hill's appeal to potential residents is based both in its historic beauty and its ready access to the cultural and business life of downtown Kansas City. Its architecture ‚Äì both historic and new, reflects Kansas City's origins. It is mostly of a 19th- century French and Federal style, similar to St. Louis's historic Soulard neighborhood. In February 2008, McCormack Baron Salazar, who owned and managed its large property as a development called New Quality Hill, sold 21 buildings (consisting of 382 residential units_ to C.R.E.S. Management LLC, a Kansas City-based development company. Its plans were for a major restoration of all the buildings and area landscape. Many other properties are privately owned, including residences and businesses. Quality Hill contains undeveloped land, most of which is owned by DST Systems and the Kauffman Foundation. This property includes several large, often-unused parking lots and many vacant house lots. The Kauffman Foundation has continued refurbishing its remaining historic buildings for lease. Recently some residents voiced concerns that the New Quality Hill portion of the neighborhood is declining. McCormack Baron Salazar initially said it was working to address those concerns, but in November 2006 decided to sell the bulk of its property on Quality Hill. As redevelopment of Downtown Kansas City burgeons, and with the population having swelled from 3,000 in 2002 to over 16,000 in 2006, Quality Hill's population continues to grow rapidly (and the cost of living there continues to increase). The Quality Hill Playhouse features many Broadway and off-Broadway shows. The River Club, one of two private city clubs on the Missouri side of Kansas City (along with the Kansas City Club in the nearby Library District), is on Quality Hill, on 8th Street between Jefferson Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, near the Lewis and Clark historic site.

He is the founder editor of the People's Archive of Rural India (PARI) and a senior fellow for Tricontinental: Institute for Social Research. He was the Rural Affairs Editor at The Hindu before resigning in 2014,. The website India Together has been archiving some of his work in The Hindu daily for the past six years. Since late 2011, he has been working on PARI, of which he is the founder editor. Amartya Sen has called him \\"one of the world's great experts on famine and hunger\\". In June 2011, Sainath was conferred an Honorary Doctor of Letters degree (DLitt) by the University of Alberta, the university's highest honor. He is one of few Indians to receive the Ramon Magsaysay Award, which he accepted in 2007 in the category of Journalism, Literature and Creative Communication Arts. PARI gets first Praful Bidwai Memorial Award Personal life Sainath was born into a Telugu speaking family in Chennai, then known as Madras. He is the grandson of freedom fighter, Indian National Congress politician and former President of India, V. V. Giri. Education Sainath went to Loyola College. He is a history graduate of Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi He was awarded a Doctor of Letters (D.Litt.) honoris causa by the University of Alberta in Edmonton in 2011. Career Sainath started his career as a journalist at the United News of India in 1980 where he received the news agency's highest individual award. He then worked for the Blitz, then a major Indian weekly tabloid published from Mumbai with a circulation of 600,000, first as foreign affairs editor and then as deputy editor, which he continued for ten years. Since 1988 Sainath has trained well over 1,000 mediapersons. He was a visiting faculty at Sophia Polytechnic's Social Communications Media course and also at the Asian College of Journalism in Chennai where he taught the course, \\"Covering Deprivation\\". He was the McGraw Professor of Writing at Princeton University Fall (2012). On 1 June 2015, Sainath became the first ThoughtWorks Chair Professor in Rural India and Digital Knowledge at the Asian College of Journalism. He is also the holder of the Coady Chair in Social Justice at St. Francis Xavier University, Canada. Sainath toured ten drought-stricken states in India, about which he recalled: \\"That's when I learned that conventional journalism was above all about the service of power. You always give the last word to authority. I got a couple of prizes which I didn't pick up because I was ashamed.\\" Awards He was awarded the 2007 Ramon Magsaysay Award, Asia's most prestigious prize (and often referred to as the 'Asian Nobel'), for Journalism Literature and Creative Communications Arts. He was given the award for his \\"passionate commitment as a journalist to restore the rural poor to India‚Äôs national consciousness\\". He was the first Indian to win the Magsaysay in that category in nearly 25 years (after R.K. Laxman). He was also the first reporter in the world to win Amnesty International's Global Human Rights Journalism Prize in its inaugural year in 2000. He won the inaugural World Media Summit Global Award for Excellence 2014 in Public Welfare for exemplary news professionals in developing countries. His other awards include: the United Nation's Food & Agriculture Organisation's (FAO) Boerma Prize (the foremost award for development journalism) in 2000; the Harry Chapin Media Award in New York, 2006; and was the first and only print media journalist until now to win the Inspiration Award at the Global Visions Film Festival in Edmonton, Canada in 2002. He was also the first Indian reporter to win the European Commission's Lorenzo Natali Prize for journalism in 1995. Apart from the 40 plus print media awards, two documentary films on his work, 'Nero‚Äôs Guests' and 'A Tribe of his Own,‚Äô have between them picked up over 20 awards across the globe. As a development journalist The International Monetary Fund-led economic reforms launched in 1991 by Manmohan Singh constituted a watershed in India's economic history and in Sainath's journalistic career. He felt that the media's attention was moving from \\"news\\" to \\"entertainment\\" and consumerism and lifestyles of the urban elite gained prominence in the newspapers which rarely carried news of the reality of poverty in India. \\"I felt that if the Indian press was covering the top 5 per cent, I should cover the bottom 5 per cent\\", says Sainath. He was awarded the fellowship and took to the back roads in the ten poorest districts of five states. It meant covering close to 100,000 km across India using 16 forms of transportation, including walking 5,000 km on foot. He credits two sympathetic editors at the Times with much of his success in getting the articles published in their present form, since it is one among the very newspapers that has been accused of shifting the onus from page one to page three. The paper ran 84 reports by Sainath across 18 months, many of them subsequently reprinted in his book, Everybody Loves A Good Drought. For more than two years, the book remained No.1 amongst non- fiction bestsellers on diverse lists across the country. Eventually, it entered the ranks of Penguin India's all-time best sellers. The book is now in its thirty-first edition and is still in print. Canadian documentary film maker Joe Moulins made a film about Sainath titled \\"A Tribe of his Own\\". When the jury at the Edmonton International Film Festival picked its winner, it decided to include Sainath in the award along with the maker of the film because this was 'an award about inspiration'. Another documentary film, Nero's Guests, looks at inequality (as manifest in India's agrarian crisis) through Sainath's reporting on the subject. Nero's Guests won the Indian Documentary Producers Association's Gold Medal for best documentary for 2010. His writing has provoked responses that include the revamping of the Drought Management Programs in the state of Tamil Nadu, development of a policy on indigenous medical systems in Malkangiri in Orissa, and revamping of the Area Development Program for tribal people in Madhya Pradesh state. The Times of India institutionalized his methods of reporting and sixty other leading newspapers initiated columns on poverty and rural development. He was instrumental in the establishment of the Agriculture Commission in Andhra Pradesh to suggest ways for improving agriculture in that state: > The crisis states are AP, Rajasthan and Orissa. In the single district of > Anantapur, in Andhra Pradesh, between 1997 and 2000, more than 1800 people > have committed suicides, but when the state assembly requested these > statistics, only 54 were listed. [see 29 April and 6 May issues of The > Hindu, for more details].

This > fatal condition results from consuming Ciba-Geigy's pesticide, which the > government distributes free, and is almost the only thing the rural poor can > readily acquire!! One of his more recent projects, on dalits, for The Hindu, is nearly complete, and he is planning a book based on this work. This project covers a gigantic area across 15 states in India. He has already covered 150,000 km and has five more states to go. Sainath also takes all the photographsphotographs that have accompanied his reporting for the past 30 years. His exhibition Visible Work, Invisible Women: Women and work in rural India has been seen by more than 600,000 people in India alone. A public space exhibition, it has been shown at factory gates, village squares, bus and railway stations, colleges and similar venues in India, but also at galleries overseas, including at the Asia Society in New York and others in Japan, Canada and elsewhere. Sainath's most important work from the past decade focuses on India's agrarian crisis, with roughly 200 exclusive field reports and news analysis and hundreds of photographs. This work established ‚Äì entirely using official government data ‚Äì that more than a quarter of a million Indian farmers have committed suicide since 1995, many of these due to debt-driven distress. Opinions On World Trade Organization (WTO) and Capitalism vs Socialism: > The WTO and GATT type of agreements are very undemocratic. Corporate leaders > make policy, not the elected representatives.

He is one of few Indians to receive the Ramon Magsaysay Award, which he accepted in 2007 in the category of Journalism, Literature and Creative Communication Arts. In January 2009 Sainath was reported to have declined a state award. But he has received close to 40 other national and international journalism awards and fellowships in 30 years as a journalist, including the Ramon Magsaysay journalism award in 2007, the European Commission's Natali Prize in 1994 and the Boerma Journalism Prize from the UN FAO in 2001 (along with CNN International's Jim Clancy), the Amnesty International global award for human rights journalism in 2000, the PUCL Human Rights Journalism Award, and the B.D. Goenka award for excellence in journalism in 2000. In June 2006 Sainath won the Judges' prizeJudges' prize (newspaper category) in the 2005 Harry Chapin Media Awards. This is for his series in The Hindu on the ongoing agrarian crisis in Vidharbha and other areas. The Harry Chapin Media Awards honour print and electronic media for work \\"that focuses on the causes of hunger and poverty,\\" including \\"work on economic inequality and insecurity, unemployment, homelessness, domestic and international policies and their reform, community empowerment, sustainable development, food production.\\" In 2009 he won the Ramnath Goenka 'Journalist of the Year' award from The Indian Express. In 1984 he was a Distinguished International Scholar at the University of Western Ontario and in 1988 a visiting lecturer at Moscow University. He was also a Distinguished International Professional at Iowa University (Fall 1998), the first McGill Fellow and lecturer at Trinity College, Hartford, Connecticut (Spring 2002), and visiting professor at University of California, Berkeley at the Graduate School of Journalism (Fall 2008). He has participated in many international initiatives on communications such as the second and third round table on Global Communications sponsored by the UNESCO (1990 and 1991) and in the UNHCR sponsored World Information Campaign on Human Rights (1991). He was conferred with the prestigious Raja-Lakshmi Award in the year 1993 from Sri Raja-Lakshmi Foundation, Chennai. He is also the only journalist to have won awards from his newspaper's rivals in the north, south, east and west of the country: from the Indian Express in Delhi, the southern edition of the Indian Express now known as the New Indian Express, the Statesman in Kolkata and the fellowship from the Times of India based in Mumbai. PARI initiative Sainath, at an interaction program in Bangalore, revealed that the People's Archive of Rural India is going to commence operation on an experimental basis from June 2013. According to him this meant to serve as \\"an archive and living journal of history of rural India\\". He also clarified that the archive will not accept any direct funding by the government or corporate houses hence it'll be an independent body. Sainath cited \\"Rural India is the most complex part of the planet\\" as the reason for launching PARI.

The name Nycticorax means \\"night raven\\" and derives from the Ancient Greek nuktos \\"night\\" and korax, \\"raven\\". It refers to the largely nocturnal feeding habits of this group of birds, and the croaking crow-like call of the best known species, the black-crowned night heron. These are medium-sized herons which often are migratory in the colder parts of their ranges. Adults are short-necked, relatively short-legged and stout herons; the two extant species both have a black crown and a whitish belly, while the wings, chest, neck and auriculars are grey or rufous depending on the species. Young birds are brown, flecked with white and grey, and are quite similar to each other in the extant species. At least some of the extinct Mascarenes taxa appear to have retained this juvenile plumage in adult birds. Night herons nest in colonies on platforms of sticks in a group of trees, or on the ground in protected locations such as islands or reed beds. Three to eight eggs are laid. They stand at the water's edge, and wait to ambush prey, mainly at night. They primarily eat small fish, crustaceans, frogs, aquatic insects, and small mammals. During the day they rest in trees or bushes.

Another campus is located on the Indonesian island of Bali (Preschool 3 to Year 12). The Bali Campus began operation in 1998 in Kerobokan and has, in 2018, moved to an amazing, newly built campus in the nearby Imam Bonjol area. The school offers the Australian Curriculum from Preschool to Year 10. It was granted \\"World School\\" status by the International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO) and so offers the senior Diploma program in the Pejaten and Bali Secondary Campuses. In 2015, AIS Indonesia was fully accredited with the Council of International Schools (CIS). The school changed its name from \\"Australian International School\\" to \\"Australian Independent School\\" in 2014, in compliance with the Indonesian government's regulations prohibiting the use of the word 'international' in school names. History AIS Indonesia was founded in 1996 in response to a demand for inclusive education within the international schools in Indonesia. Prior to the formation of AIS, children with special educational needs were not accepted by any international school in Jakarta. With the involvement and support of professional educators, diplomatic and commercial representatives as well as a group of parents, the school opened on 15 July 1996 with an enrolment of eleven students. Today the school has more than 600 students from over 30 nationalities and offers Preschool to Year 12 classes with special education for students with learning support needs, limited English language proficiency or physical disabilities. The school has recently embarked on campus redevelopment projects on land opposite existing sites in Jakarta and in April 2018 moved into a fantastic newly built campus in Bali. Building projects underway and recently completed will significantly increase AIS Indonesia's enrolment capacity.

Endemic to Western Australia, it occurs mostly throughout the Wheatbelt region. It is now especially common on road verges, where it sometimes forms thickets. Description Rock sheoak is a dioecious tree that grows to a height of . The dark coloured bark is longitudinally fissured. It has sparse foliage that forms a rounded outline. Sometimes it branches at ground level, but usually has a bole of a few metres. As with other Allocasuarina species, the foliage consists of slender green branchlets informally referred to as \\"needles\\" but more correctly termed cladodes. These are segmented, and the true leaves are reduced to tiny teeth encircling each joint. Male trees have small brown flower spikes at the end of branchlets. Female trees bear small flowers on short branchlets of their own. The red to brown coloured flowers appear between May and January. Fertilised flowers develop egg-shaped cones about wide. Classification Rock Sheoak was first collected on Mount Brown near York in 1840 by Ludwig Preiss. The specific name huegeliana honours the Austrian naturalist Baron Carl von Huegel. The species was first described by the botanist Friedrich Anton Wilhelm Miquel as Casuarina huegeliana in 1845 as part of the Johann Georg Christian Lehmann work Casuarinaceae. Plantae Preissianae, it as later reclassified to the current genera by Lawrence Alexander Sidney Johnson in 1982 in the work Notes on Casuarinaceae II published in the Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Gardens. The common name \\"rock sheoak\\" refers to its habitat, which often contains granite rocks. The alternative common name \\"sighing sheoak\\" alludes to the sound of the wind in the foliage. Distribution The species is common throughout south west Western Australia and to the north in the Mid West through the Wheatbelt, Peel, South West, Great Southern and the southern Goldfields-Esperance regions. It is found as far north as the Murchison River extending through to the southern coastline although populations are fragmented. It grows in sandy to sandy-loam soils and is mostly associated with granite substrate or outcrops. It is also used as host species in Sandalwood plantationsSandalwood Guide for Farmers Forest Products Commission April 2007' Cultivation A. huegeliana is a moderate to fast growing tree that is nitrogen fixing. It can be grown as a windbreak. The species thrives in well-drained soils but will do poorly in saline or poorly drained areas. The attractive and dense wood from the tree is used to make specialty furniture while the foliage is used by grazing stock as fodder. The species is drought and frost tolerant but will be killed by fire. Trees can live up an age of over 15 years.

The word \\"indefeasible\\" means \\"not capable of being annulled, or voided, or undone\\". The customer purchases the right to use a certain amount of the capacity of the system, for a specified number of years. IRU contracts are almost always long term, commonly lasting 20 to 30 years. The communication system can be a wire cable, such as a submarine communications cable, fiber-optic cable, or satellite. An IRU owner can unconditionally and exclusively use the relevant capacity of the IRU grantor‚Äôs network for the specified time period. These contracts obligate the purchaser to pay a portion of the operating costs, and the costs of maintaining the cable, including any costs incurred repairing the cable after mishaps. The right of use is indefeasible, so the capacity purchased is also nonreturnable, and maintenance costs incurred become payable and irrefusable. Definition  The IRU \\"shall mean the exclusive, unrestricted, and indefeasible right to use the relevant capacity (including equipment, fibers or capacity) for any legal purpose\\".http://contracts.corporate.findlaw.com/agreements/athome/att.iru.1998.12.19.html It refers to the bandwidth purchased after, for example, a submarine cable system has been sealed at the end of construction, and to the maintenance agreement (C&MA;) among the owners. It is a way for the owners to capitalize the unused capacity or any unowned capacity, after the system comes into service. In short, buying an IRU gives the purchaser the right to use some capacity on a telecommunications cable system, including the right to lease that capacity to someone else. Smaller companies that need a leased line between, say, London and New York do not buy an IRU ‚Äì they lease capacity from a telecommunications company that themselves may lease a larger amount of capacity from another company (and so on), until at the end of the chain of contracts there is a company that has an IRU, or wholly owns a cable system. Today, so-called IRUs allow a telecom carrier to buy all types of telecom capacity and gear at low rates, typically for periods of 20 to 25 years. Since IRUs are technically rights to a physical part of an underground cable, they can be considered an asset. That means their cost isn't part of a company's operating results, but of the property, plant, and equipment line listed on a firm's balance sheet. According to the Wall Street Journal, dark fiber was pioneered decades ago by AT&T;, when it still enjoyed monopoly power. IRUs allowed AT&T;'s competitors to gain access to the expensive undersea cables that only AT&T; could afford to build. There remains some controversy over booking IRUs as assets in an asset-swap transaction between companies. Since IRU's are technically rights to a physical part of a cable, they can be considered an asset, which means their cost isn't part of the company's operating results, but shows up under tangible assets. The IRU is counted as though it is a part of the physical plant of the business buying the IRU.  Dark fiber IRU  The Dark fiber (DF) IRU \\"shall mean the exclusive, unrestricted, and indefeasible right to use one, a pair, or more strands of fiber of a fiber cable for any legal purpose\\". With an IRU contractual arrangement the buyer of the IRU can unconditionally, and exclusively, use the fibers of the IRU for a long time period, around 25‚Äì30 years. In this case dark fiber is called \\"dark\\" since it has to be lit by the IRU owner, not the cable's owner. The wholesale purchase of dark fiber has normally been accomplished by means of IRUs. Fiber cable owners do not normally sell their fiber but offer IRUs for up to 20 years for unrestricted use. 10 to 25 years corresponds to a typical lifetime of the Optical fiber cable systems. The upfront cost for the purchase of a 20-year IRU can be a one-time investment. It will normally be associated with ongoing obligations for shared maintenance. Usually, the IRU can be considered to be a physical asset, which can be resold, traded or used as collateral. For regulatory reasons, generally only licensed carriers are allowed access to support structures, and to municipal rights of way. The IRU contract defines detailed technical and performance specifications for the IRU fibers. More specifically, it includes dark fiber acceptance and testing procedures, the description of the dark fiber physical route, operating specifications for the dark fiber infrastructure, performance specifications (attenuation, Chromatic Dispersion, Polarization Mode Dispersion, Optical Return Loss), maintenance and restoration terms. These terms must be valid for the full duration of the IRU contract. Moreover, it includes specific actions and procedures in cases of changes on the IRU grantor‚Äôs fiber network, degradation of fiber performance etc.  Payment  * A lump-sum payment corresponding to the dark-fiber construction cost and the use of the dark-fiber infrastructure for the IRU duration. This payment usually accounts for the greatest part of the IRU budget. * A periodic fee corresponding to the maintenance services provided to IRU user by the IRU grantor. This is usually fixed or slightly increasing, taking into account inflation.http://www.porta- optica.org/publications/POS-D3.2_Economical_analysis.pdf References External links * Economic analysis, dark fibre usage cost model and model of operations, Porta Optica Study * Example agreement: SEA-ME-WE 3 STANDARD IRU AGREEMENT Contract law Legal documents Submarine communications cables Fiber-optic communications ","title":"Indefeasible rights of use"},{"id":"2977050","text":"Johnsons CrossingGovernment of Yukon or Johnson's Crossing is a settlement in Yukon, Canada.

Three of the four species are found in East, South and South-east Asia, while the last species, the white-backed night heron, is found in sub-Saharan Africa. The Japanese and Malayan night herons resemble each other, being relatively short-billed and overall brown with a dark line from the throat to the upper belly. The larger white-eared and white-backed night herons are darker, with distinctive white markings on the face and neck in the former, and an entirely black head in the latter. Their behavior, especially that of the white-eared night heron, is relatively poorly known compared to that of other night herons, but they nest alone or in small groups, and a clutch of two to five eggs has been recorded. While generally nocturnal and crepuscular, they have been recorded feeding during the day in clouded weather. They are skulking, and known to feed on crabs, crustacean, fish, insects, frogs and other small animals.

To illustrate, a function application may evaluate the argument before evaluating the function's body and pass the ability to look up the argument's current value and modify it via assignment. The notion of reduction strategy in lambda calculus is similar but distinct. In practical terms, many modern programming languages like C# and Java have converged on a call-by-value/call-by-reference evaluation strategy for function calls. Some languages, especially lower-level languages such as C++, combine several notions of parameter passing. Historically, call by value and call by name date back to ALGOL 60, which was designed in the late 1950s. Call by reference is used by PL/I and some Fortran systems.Some Fortran systems use call by copy-restore. Purely functional languages like Haskell, as well as non-purely functional languages like R, use call by need. Evaluation strategy is specified by the programming language definition, and is not a function of any specific implementation. Strict evaluation In strict evaluation, the arguments to a function are always evaluated completely before the function is applied. Under Church encoding, eager evaluation of operators maps to strict evaluation of functions; for this reason, strict evaluation is sometimes called \\"eager\\". Most existing programming languages use strict evaluation for functions. =Applicative order= Applicative order evaluation is an evaluation strategy in which an expression is evaluated by repeatedly evaluating its leftmost innermost reducible expression. This means that a function's arguments are evaluated before the function is applied. =Call by value= Call by value (also known as pass by value) is the most common evaluation strategy, used in languages as different as C and Scheme. In call by value, the argument expression is evaluated, and the resulting value is bound to the corresponding variable in the function (frequently by copying the value into a new memory region). If the function or procedure is able to assign values to its parameters, only its local variable is assigned‚Äîthat is, anything passed into a function call is unchanged in the caller's scope when the function returns. Call by value is not a single evaluation strategy, but rather the family of evaluation strategies in which a function's argument is evaluated before being passed to the function. While many programming languages (such as Common Lisp, Eiffel and Java) that use call by value evaluate function arguments left-to-right, some evaluate functions and their arguments right-to-left, and others (such as Scheme, OCaml and C) do not specify order. Implicit limitations In some cases, the term \\"call by value\\" is problematic, as the value which is passed is not the value of the variable as understood by the ordinary meaning of value, but an implementation-specific reference to the value. The effect is that what syntactically looks like call by value may end up rather behaving like call by reference or call by sharing, often depending on very subtle aspects of the language semantics. The reason for passing a reference is often that the language technically does not provide a value representation of complicated data, but instead represents them as a data structure while preserving some semblance of value appearance in the source code. Exactly where the boundary is drawn between proper values and data structures masquerading as such is often hard to predict. In C, an array (of which strings are special cases) is a data structure but the name of an array is treated as (has as value) the reference to the first element of the array, while a struct variable's name refers to a value even if it has fields that are vectors. In Maple, a vector is a special case of a table and therefore a data structure, but a list (which gets rendered and can be indexed in exactly the same way) is a value. In Tcl, values are \\"dual-ported\\" such that the value representation is used at the script level, and the language itself manages the corresponding data structure, if one is required. Modifications made via the data structure are reflected back to the value representation and vice versa. The description \\"call by value where the value is a reference\\" is common (but should not be understood as being call by reference); another term is call by sharing. Thus the behaviour of call by value Java or Visual Basic and call by value C or Pascal are significantly different: in C or Pascal, calling a function with a large structure as an argument will cause the entire structure to be copied (except if it's actually a reference to a structure), potentially causing serious performance degradation, and mutations to the structure are invisible to the caller. However, in Java or Visual Basic only the reference to the structure is copied, which is fast, and mutations to the structure are visible to the caller. =Call by reference= Call by reference (or pass by reference) is an evaluation strategy where a function receives an implicit reference to a variable used as argument, rather than a copy of its value. This typically means that the function can modify (i.e., assign to) the variable used as argument‚Äîsomething that will be seen by its caller. Call by reference can therefore be used to provide an additional channel of communication between the called function and the calling function. A call-by- reference language makes it more difficult for a programmer to track the effects of a function call, and may introduce subtle bugs. A simple litmus test for whether a language supports call-by-reference semantics is if it's possible to write a traditional \`swap(a, b)\` function in the language. Many languages support call by reference in some form, but few use it by default. FORTRAN II is an early example of a call-by-reference language. A few languages, such as C++, PHP, Visual Basic .NET, C# and REALbasic, default to call by value, but offer a special syntax for call-by-reference parameters. C++ additionally offers call by reference to const. Call by reference can be simulated in languages that use call by value and don't exactly support call by reference, by making use of references (objects that refer to other objects), such as pointers (objects representing the memory addresses of other objects). Languages such as C, ML and Rust use this technique. It is not a separate evaluation strategy‚Äîthe language calls by value‚Äîbut sometimes it is referred to as \\"call by address\\" or \\"pass by address\\". In ML, references are type- and memory-safe, similar to Rust. A similar effect is achieved by call by sharing (passing an object, which can then be mutated), used in languages like Java, Python, and Ruby. In purely functional languages there is typically no semantic difference between the two strategies (since their data structures are immutable, so there is no possibility for a function to modify any of its arguments), so they are typically described as call by value even though implementations frequently use call by reference internally for the efficiency benefits. Following is an example that demonstrates call by reference in the E programming language: def modify(var p, &q;) { p := 27 # passed by value: only the local parameter is modified q := 27 # passed by reference: variable used in call is modified } ? var a := 1 # value: 1 ? var b := 2 # value: 2 ? modify(a, &b;) ? a # value: 1 ? b # value: 27 Following is an example of call by address that simulates call by reference in C: void modify(int p, int* q, int* r) { p = 27; // passed by value: only the local parameter is modified *q = 27; // passed by value or reference, check call site to determine which *r = 27; // passed by value or reference, check call site to determine which } int main() { int a = 1; int b = 1; int x = 1; int* c = &x; modify(a, &b;, c); // a is passed by value, b is passed by reference by creating a pointer (call by value), // c is a pointer passed by value // b and x are changed return 0; } =Call by sharing= Call by sharing (also known as \\"call by object\\" or \\"call by object-sharing\\") is an evaluation strategy first noted by Barbara Liskov in 1974 for the CLU language. It is used by languages such as Python, Java (for object references), Ruby, JavaScript, Scheme, OCaml, AppleScript, and many others. However, the term \\"call by sharing\\" is not in common use; the terminology is inconsistent across different sources. For example, in the Java community, they say that Java is call by value. Call by sharing implies that values in the language are based on objects rather than primitive types, i.e., that all values are \\"boxed\\". Because they are boxed they can be said to pass by copy of reference (where primitives are boxed before passing and unboxed at called function). The semantics of call by sharing differ from call by reference: \\"In particular it is not call by value because mutations of arguments performed by the called routine will be visible to the caller. And it is not call by reference because access is not given to the variables of the caller, but merely to certain objects\\". So, for example, if a variable was passed, it is not possible to simulate an assignment on that variable in the callee's scope.Note: in CLU language, \\"variable\\" corresponds to \\"identifier\\" and \\"pointer\\" in modern standard usage, not to the general/usual meaning of variable. However, since the function has access to the same object as the caller (no copy is made), mutations to those objects, if the objects are mutable, within the function are visible to the caller, which may appear to differ from call by value semantics. Mutations of a mutable object within the function are visible to the caller because the object is not copied or cloned --it is shared. For example, in Python, lists are mutable, so: def f(list): list.append(1) m = [] f(m) print(m) outputs \`[1]\` because the \`append\` method modifies the object on which it is called. Assignments within a function are not noticeable to the caller, because, in these languages, passing the variable only means passing (access to) the actual object referred to by the variable, not access to the original (caller's) variable. Since the rebound variable only exists within the scope of the function, the counterpart in the caller retains its original binding. Compare the Python mutation above with the code below, which binds the formal argument to a new object: def f(list): list = [1] m = [] f(m) print(m) outputs \`[]\`, because the statement \`list = [1]\` reassigns a new list to the variable rather than to the location it references. For immutable objects, there is no real difference between call by sharing and call by value, except if object identity is visible in the language. The use of call by sharing with mutable objects is an alternative to input/output parameters: the parameter is not assigned to (the argument is not overwritten and object identity is not changed), but the object (argument) is mutated. Although this term has widespread usage in the Python community, identical semantics in other languages such as Java and Visual Basic are often described as call by value, where the value is implied to be a reference to the object. =Call by copy-restore= Call by copy-restore‚Äîalso known as \\"copy-in copy-out\\", \\"call by value result\\", \\"call by value return\\" (as termed in the Fortran community)‚Äîis a special case of call by reference where the provided reference is unique to the caller. This variant has gained attention in multiprocessing contexts and Remote procedure call: if a parameter to a function call is a reference that might be accessible by another thread of execution, its contents may be copied to a new reference that is not; when the function call returns, the updated contents of this new reference are copied back to the original reference (\\"restored\\"). The semantics of call by copy- restore also differ from those of call by reference, where two or more function arguments alias one another (i.e., point to the same variable in the caller's environment). Under call by reference, writing to one will affect the other; call by copy-restore avoids this by giving the function distinct copies, but leaves the result in the caller's environment undefined depending on which of the aliased arguments is copied back first‚Äîwill the copies be made in left-to-right order both on entry and on return? When the reference is passed to the callee uninitialized, this evaluation strategy may be called \\"call by result\\". =Partial evaluation= In partial evaluation, evaluation may continue into the body of a function that has not been applied. Any sub- expressions that do not contain unbound variables are evaluated, and function applications whose argument values are known may be reduced. If there are side effects, complete partial evaluation may produce unintended results, which is why systems that support partial evaluation tend to do so only for \\"pure\\" expressions (i.e., those without side effects) within functions. Non-strict evaluation In non-strict evaluation, arguments to a function are not evaluated unless they are actually used in the evaluation of the function body. Under Church encoding, lazy evaluation of operators maps to non-strict evaluation of functions; for this reason, non-strict evaluation is often referred to as \\"lazy\\". Boolean expressions in many languages use a form of non-strict evaluation called short-circuit evaluation, where evaluation returns as soon as it can be determined that an unambiguous Boolean will result‚Äîfor example, in a disjunctive expression (OR) where \`true\` is encountered, or in a conjunctive expression (AND) where \`false\` is encountered, and so forth. Conditional expressions also usually use lazy evaluation, where evaluation returns as soon as an unambiguous branch will result. =Normal order= Normal order evaluation is an evaluation strategy in which an expression is evaluated by repeatedly evaluating its leftmost outermost reducible expression. This means that a function's arguments are not evaluated before the function is applied. =Call by name= Call by name is an evaluation strategy where the arguments to a function are not evaluated before the function is called‚Äîrather, they are substituted directly into the function body (using capture-avoiding substitution) and then left to be evaluated whenever they appear in the function. If an argument is not used in the function body, the argument is never evaluated; if it is used several times, it is re-evaluated each time it appears. (See Jensen's Device.) Call- by-name evaluation is occasionally preferable to call-by-value evaluation. If a function's argument is not used in the function, call by name will save time by not evaluating the argument, whereas call by value will evaluate it regardless. If the argument is a non-terminating computation, the advantage is enormous. However, when the function argument is used, call by name is often slower, requiring a mechanism such as a thunk. An early use was ALGOL 60. Today's .NET languages can simulate call by name using delegates or \`Expression\` parameters. The latter results in an abstract syntax tree being given to the function. Eiffel provides agents, which represent an operation to be evaluated when needed. Seed7 provides call by name with function parameters. Java programs can accomplish similar lazy evaluation using lambda expressions and the \`java.util.function.Supplier\` interface. =Call by need= Call by need is a memoized variant of call by name, where, if the function argument is evaluated, that value is stored for subsequent use. If the argument is pure (i.e., free of side effects), this produces the same results as call by name, saving the cost of recomputing the argument. Haskell is a well-known language that uses call-by-need evaluation. Because evaluation of expressions may happen arbitrarily far into a computation, Haskell only supports side effects (such as mutation) via the use of monads. This eliminates any unexpected behavior from variables whose values change prior to their delayed evaluation. In R's implementation of call by need, all arguments are passed, meaning that R allows arbitrary side effects. Lazy evaluation is the most common implementation of call-by-need semantics, but variations like optimistic evaluation exist. .NET languages implement call by need using the type \`Lazy\`. =Call by macro expansion= Call by macro expansion is similar to call by name, but uses textual substitution rather than capture, thereby avoiding substitution. But macro substitution may cause mistakes, resulting in variable capture, leading to undesired behavior. Hygienic macros avoid this problem by checking for and replacing shadowed variables that are not parameters. Nondeterministic strategies =Full Œ≤-reduction= Under \\"full Œ≤-reduction\\", any function application may be reduced (substituting the function's argument into the function using capture-avoiding substitution) at any time. This may be done even within the body of an unapplied function. =Call by future= \\"Call by future\\", also known as \\"parallel call by name\\", is a concurrent evaluation strategy in which the value of a future expression is computed concurrently with the flow of the rest of the program with promises, also known as futures. When the promise's value is needed, the main program blocks until the promise has a value (the promise or one of the promises finishes computing, if it has not already completed by then). This strategy is non-deterministic, as the evaluation can occur at any time between creation of the future (i.e., when the expression is given) and use of the future's value. It is similar to call by need in that the value is only computed once, and computation may be deferred until the value is needed, but it may be started before. Further, if the value of a future is not needed, such as if it is a local variable in a function that returns, the computation may be terminated partway through. If implemented with processes or threads, creating a future will spawn one or more new processes or threads (for the promises), accessing the value will synchronize these with the main thread, and terminating the computation of the future corresponds to killing the promises computing its value. If implemented with a coroutine, as in .NET async/await, creating a future calls a coroutine (an async function), which may yield to the caller, and in turn be yielded back to when the value is used, cooperatively multitasking. =Optimistic evaluation= Optimistic evaluation is another call-by-need variant where the function's argument is partially evaluated for some amount of time (which may be adjusted at runtime). After that time has passed, evaluation is aborted and the function is applied using call by need. This approach avoids some the call-by-need strategy's runtime expenses while retaining desired termination characteristics.

It is based on Rugby World Cup '95 by Creative Assembly, but using the rugby league rules instead of rugby union. In addition to the league that names the game, the Australian Rugby League, the game also includes the State of Origin, Super League (eleven English teams plus one French) and international mode. While the ARL has all correct team names, player names are fictitious. Gameplay Due to the limitations of the console, ARL presents a simplified version of the game, yet allowing a wide variety of moves. Running is done with the C button, and while holding allows a player to accelerate, while it is mashed, it allows to break a tackle. Passing is done by pressing the B button with a direction; if no direction is entered, the player fakes a pass. the A button, if pressed inside the try area (or in jump distance), grounds the ball, if far and pressed in combination of the direction of the attack attempts a drop goal or kicks for touch, if pressed in combination with a direction against the attack, performs a grubber kick. The A and B buttons pressed at the same time perform a bomb kick (referred as \\"Up and Under\\" in the manual), and an A plus C combination is mostly a defensive kick, which clears the ball as far away as possible into touch. Without the ball, controls are simpler: the A button tackles, the B changes player and C increases player speed. The game has a few criticisms; it is very undisciplined as far as tactics go, it is very hard to pull good kicks during play (which forces players to, and the lack of a difficulty level slider makes the game too easy for expert players. There are also some bugs regarding ball possession (occasionally, the ball can change from one team to another in the middle of a play for no reason at all) and the engine often flickers players when there are too many of them in an area. The lack of physical difference between forwards and backs is also often mentioned. ARL allows several options to be tweaked, such as half length (from two minutes to 40), temperature (hot temperatures wear out the players quicker, while colder affects ball handling) and pitch condition (a dry pitch hurts tackled players more and bounces the ball more, while drenched affects running). Teams and leagues All game modes output a Password which allows the player to play a league in several sittings. Each player is individualized, and is rated in each key aspect of the game. The Australian Rugby league is a 20 team competition composed by a 20 team league, then followed by an eight team playoff, which is far from being straight forward. There are two sets of quarter finals, where the winners of the \\"major\\" quarterfinals go through the semi finals, while the winners of the \\"minor\\" quarterfinals have to play against the losers of the \\"majors\\", and only then the remaining two semi- finalists are known. It is also possible to start from the playoffs. State of Origin is a three match series between New South Wales Rugby League and Queensland Rugby League, where the winner is the first team to win two matches. Even if a team beats the other in the first two matches, the third is always played. European leagues are unlicensed, which means they only carry the city name and a patterned flag, which in most cases fits the actual equipments of the teams. After the all vs all league, the best four teams enter a playoff to determine the champions. The International tournament is a one-legged eight team knockout competition. While the focus of RWC'95 was on national teams, ARL downplays it to the point of only including eight teams.

The music contained in the troper was long considered to be indecipherable, as there are only rudimentary indications of pitch and duration by the use of a form of notation known as neumes and a tonary which classified and indicated the melodic mode (octoechos). However, recent scholarship, originally by Andreas Holschneider in Die Organa von Winchester, 1968, followed in the 1990s by Mary Berry, Christopher Page, Susan Rankin and others has allowed the music to be performed.

In August 2014, it became an all-digital publication. It published a free newspaper every weekday until January 2013, at which point its print distribution was reduced to once per week. The editorial board announced that ASU Student Media will begin to focus on \\"a host of new digital products and special print products.\\" History The history of The State Press goes back to ASU's establishment as a \\"Normal School\\" during Arizona's territorial period. The university's first student newspaper, The Normal Echo, made its debut on October 18, 1890. Back then, it was a one-page supplement to the local newspaper now called the East Valley Tribune. The existence of The State Press as an independent entity began in 1906, when it became the Tempe Normal Student, a four-page tabloid distributed on campus each Friday for five cents per copy. The paper changed its name to Tempe Collegian in 1925 when the school's name changed to Tempe College in the same year. The name was eventually shortened to the Collegian in 1930 and fell under the control of the newly created Faculty of Journalism two years later. The newspaper was renamed the Arizona State Press in 1936, and the name was shortened to State Press the next year. (The word \\"The\\" was added to the masthead in the early 2000s.) In the 1970s, The State Press regained its independence from what is now the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication. Initially, the president of ASU at the time, John Schwada, placed the paper under the authority of a Board of Student Media. The first board resigned within a month because of a disagreement with the Arizona Board of Regents regarding its role in the newspaper's affairs. The department is now under the Office of Vice President for University Student Initiatives and maintains a significant amount of independence from the school; although ASU provides equipment and offices on campus, The State Press pays production costs and salaries through advertising revenue. Decisions on editorial content are left to the paper's editorial board; the full-time director of ASU Student Media plays a purely advisory role. On September 10, 1984, the paper added a Monday edition and began to operate as a five-days-a-week daily publication. In 2008, the newspaper opened a second newsroom on ASU's Downtown Phoenix campus, in the newly constructed Cronkite/Eight Building. Many reporters and a handful of editors work from the downtown newsroom, while the balance of the newsroom staff ‚Äì as well as the advertising, production and administrative staffs ‚Äì work from ASU Student Media's headquarters in Matthews Center on the Tempe campus. In the spring semester of 2013, The State Press went from being a five-day-a-week publication to a weekly, ending a 28-year run as a student daily. This came alongside an effort to boost the paper's online presence. The paper was also delivered to dorms each Thursday. In fall 2014, The State Press became the first major student university newspaper to go all-digital. Alumni The paper's most famous ex-employee is former Monday Night Football sportscaster and ASU alumnus Al Michaels, who covered football and basketball as the paper's assistant sports editor in the fall of 1963 and became sports editor in 1964. Michaels is rumored to have been fired for reasons unknown. Cartoonist Tony Carrillo began drawing his F Minus comic strip for The State Press while he was a student at ASU. The single-panel comic initially ran in The State Press for four semesters and is now syndicated, appearing in more than 100 newspapers ‚Äì including The State Press. Carrillo also painted the city skyline mural in the underground window well in The State Press' Tempe newsroom. Other notable State Pressers include: *Jerry Dumas, a comic strip writer and artist *Kris Mayes, a former chair of the Arizona Corporation Commission *Len Munsil, who ran for governor of Arizona in 2006. Layout From January 2013 until August 2014, The State Press published newspapers every Thursday of the semester and features student articles, world and national wire reports, editorials, opinions, and comics, both student-drawn and syndicated. On Tuesdays, a campus-specific front page had been produced and printed on the 500 copies of the newspaper delivered to ASU's West campus. A similar campus-specific edition was produced for the Polytechnic campus on Thursdays. Both zoned editions were launched in the fall of 2008 but suspended in February 2009 due to both the cost of the endeavor and uncertainty about the future of both outlying campuses in light of state budget cuts. A separate staff produces State Press Magazine, which had been printed on the backside of the daily newspaper until August 2007, when it became a separate publication. In 2009, SPM became an online-only magazine, publishing daily stories and blogs that examined university issues such as current events, arts and entertainment. In spring 2011, SPM began releasing a stand-alone print issue once per semester, in addition to its daily online publication. Starting in fall of 2012, it began releasing two issues a semester. SPM continued releasing print issues with a smaller circulation as The State Press went entirely online. In November 2011, the paper moved from a traditional broadsheet format to a tabloid/compact format. Design editor Taylor Lineberger led the redesign, along with editor-in-chief Nathan Meacham. A majority of the paper is now printed in color. \\"We decided the paper needed a more visually striking design ‚Äì one that would be more appealing to our readership. The front page will now grab your attention in a way it never has before. The paper will be easier to flip through, read and digest between classes, or on your lunch break,\\" the editorial board wrote in a Nov. 20 editorial.http://www.statepress.com/2011/11/20/editorial-redesigning-your- newspaper/ \\"The news cycle has changed and so have your reading habits. News hits your cellphone or laptop long before you have the chance to pick up The State Press on campus. That‚Äôs why we created a product that speaks more to the college experience ‚Äì a product that ties traditional print news to new forms of digital media.\\" The paper's staff uses Macintosh computers. When the publication put out a paper product, pages were laid out in Adobe InDesign. Today The State Press uses Gryphon as its content management system. From the late 1990s through May 2009, the online edition of the newspaper was the ASU Web Devil, which served as a portal to all Student Media Web sites. By June 2009, the other Student Media properties ‚Äì Sun Devil Television and State Press Magazine ‚Äì had launched their own Web sites hosted separately from the Web Devil, so the site was rebranded as StatePress.com, returning to the URL used for the site in the 1990s. In addition, a spoof edition of the daily paper, The Stale Mess, was published at the end of each semester by the State Press staff. The Stale Mess stopped when the publication ended its print run. Clashes with administration In 2003, a memorable Stale Mess spoof cover featured a simulated photo of ASU President Michael Crow passed out in a bathtub, with vomit on his shirt and a bottle of cheap vodka cradled on his arm. Crow later complained about the photo to The State Press editorial board. In spring 2004, an article about alleged mistreatment of employees at ASU's Department of Residential Life was criticized as one-sided by the department. State Press Magazine created a stir in fall 2004 by publishing a full-page cover photo of a woman's naked, pierced breast on its cover; the publication drew criticism from prominent conservatives and ASU boosters such as Ira Fulton, who felt the university's administration needed to have more oversight regarding editorial decisions. The incident may have led to efforts by the administration to shut down the paper. The paper also won an award for the way it handled pressure from the administration concerning content in the wake of the SPM controversy. 2012 Plagiarism Scandal On September 1, 2012, the paper's editorial board printed an apology to its readers after discovering that Raquel Velasco, who was writing on issues related to Tempe (home of the ASU Tempe Campus), plagiarized and/or used facts and quotes without proper attribution, from the Phoenix Business Journal, Arizona Republic, and KNXV-TV (locally known as ABC15), among other news organizations. In addition, the paper's editorial board discovered that Velasco may have also concocted facts on at least one story. The State Press Editorial Board said Velasco's stories were retracted, and Velasco's relationship to The State Press was terminated. Investigation to Velasco's previous articles are still under investigation. In its apology, the editorial board mentioned the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication's efforts to teach students the virtues of ethics and aversion of plagiarism. The school itself also has a written policy that students involved in academic dishonesty, which includes plagiarism and fabrication, will, if found to have engaged in such behavior, will receive a grade of XE (failure through academic dishonesty), and expelled from the School, without the possibility of reinstatement. Searches on The State Presss website reveal that Velasco contributed 7 articles to the paper, of which 4 have been retracted by the paper itself. Organization The State Press operates under a departmental umbrella of ASU Student Media, which also features a multimedia department (statepress.com) and a magazine (State Press Magazine). Student Media organizations operate from the basement of Matthews Center at ASU's Tempe campus and a newsroom in the Cronkite building at ASU's Downtown Phoenix campus that was opened in fall 2008. A student radio station (KASC) runs independently of Student Media through the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication but is affiliated with ASU Student Media by name.

Early years  The daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Mason Bierce, Adams was born in San Antonio, Texas, but her family moved to California when she was two. During her high school years, she studied violin and drama, and she was selected to be a concert mistress of the all-city high school orchestra of Los Angeles. She received a full scholarship to Juilliard, which she turned down to spend years studying at the Pasadena Playhouse. Acting career After the Playhouse, she got her start on Lux Radio Theatre and then with the Harry Conover Modeling Agency, where she was given her nickname \\"Poni\\". This was supposedly due to her love of horses, but in reality it was to provide her with a more memorable stage name. (In the book Westerns Women: Interviews with 50 Leading Ladies of Movie and Television Westerns from the 1930s to the 1960s, Adams said: \\"I was given that name at the Harry Conover Modeling Agency. Why, I don't know!) She returned to using her real name in 1945. Military personnel played a role in her change of names from Poni Adams to Jane Adams. A photograph printed in newspapers in 1946 carried the caption: \\"GI JANE ‚Äî Jane Adams ‚Äî formerly Poni Adams ‚Äî holds some of 32,851 letters her press agent said came from GIs after she appealed for aid in choosing a new name.\\" Adams' first screen appearance was in So You Want to Give Up Smoking, a short film in 1942. She may be best known for her role as Nina in House of Dracula (1945), but she also has the distinction of acting in early adaptations of both major DC Comics franchises: Batman, where she played Vicki Vale in the second Batman serial, Batman and Robin, and also a character in the first Superman television series. Personal life and death On July 27, 1940, Adams married Ensign J.C.H. Smith, a United States Navy pilot, in Norfolk, Virginia. He died in World War II on September 15, 1943, in Hawaii. On July 14, 1945, in Hollywood, California, she married Thomas K. Turnage, a decorated major general with the army. Turnage served in the Korean War and earned the Distinguished Service Medal and Bronze Star. He later served as the last administrator of the Veterans Administration before the VA became a cabinet department during Ronald Reagan's presidential term. Adams and Turnage had two children. On May 21, 2014, Adams died in Bellingham, Washington, at the age of 95. She was buried (as Betty J. Turnage) beside her husband in Arlington National Cemetery.

The Glenelg River passes through the town. Casterton is named after the village of Casterton in south-east Cumbria in England. History Prior to white settlement, Aboriginal people of the Konongwootong Gundidj clan lived in the local area. The first white explorers to pass through the area were the expedition led by Major Thomas Mitchell in 1836 who spoke enthusiastically of the landscape's green hills, soft soils and flowery plains, describing it as ideal for farming and settlement, naming it Australia Felix.http://www.swvic.org/casterton/Casterton%20&%20Surrounding%20Districts%20History.doc The first white settlers in the area were the Henty brothers who had landed in Portland, Victoria in 1834 and who claimed 28,000 hectares between what are now the towns of Casterton and Coleraine. 'Warrock' Station, a sheep farming settlement, was established in 1841, 26 km north of what would be Casterton. The township of Casterton began on the crossing site of the Glenelg River, the location having been surveyed in 1840, and the first pub, the Glenelg Inn, was established in 1846 with a post-office opening the following year. The early history of the region was marred by violent clashes between settlers and Indigenous people, including multiple murders of Aboriginals that took place near Casterton in the late 1830s and early 1840s. In 1891, a large number of Casterton women signed the Women's Suffrage Petition to be tabled in the Victorian Parliament to grant women the right to vote (which was not allowed until 1908). By the 1890s, increasing soil erosion saw wheat-farming around Casterton begin to decline and it was largely replaced by meat, wool and dairy farming. Casterton's population expanded in the early 20th century, especially in the 1920s with the arrival of large numbers of soldier-settler farmers and during the post-war era in the 1950s. The Rail line to Casterton was closed 12 September 1977.http://www.swvic.org/casterton/newsletter/201207.pdf The town's population began to decline in the 1990s which was consistent with the statewide trend of decreasing populations in many rural areas and the ageing of the local population. The 2016 census indicated the average age of Casterton's population was 55.http://quickstats.censusdata.abs.gov.au/census_services/getproduct/census/2016/quickstat/SSC20510 Traditional ownership The formally recognised traditional owners for the area in which Casterton sits are the Gunditjmara People who are represented by the Gunditj Mirring Traditional Owners Aboriginal Corporation.

Patterson exchanged 'Kelpie' for a horse and the dog's new owner, a drover named Jack Gleeson, took her to Ardlethan, NSW where she mated with a black male Rutherford Sheepdog named 'Moss', producing several litters. Kelpie later mated with another male named 'Caesar', producing a female pup named 'King's Kelpie' which grew to become a champion sheepdog. The breed was further developed and refined during the next few decades. Ardlethan also lays claim to be the birthplace of the breed. In 1997, a working dog auction was held in Casterton, an annual event which grew to become the Casterton Kelpie Festival in 2001. The auction and festival event is now held each June in Casterton To mark Casterton's 150th anniversary celebrations in 1996, a bronze sculpture of a kelpie by artist Peter Corlett was unveiled in front of Casterton's Town Hall. The Fleur de Lys A large version of the Fleur de Lys, used as the emblem of the Scouts, is carved into Toorak Hill, a steep hill overlooking the eastern end of Casterton's main thoroughfare. The design has a circumference of 91 metres. In 1935, the Boy-Scouts and Cubs, in honour of the Silver Jubilee Celebrations of King George V, carved a large-scale version of the words 'The King' into the hill, each letter some six metres long. Encouraged by the success of this, the Scouts, to celebrate the 1941 opening of the town's new Scout-hall, carved the Fleur de Lys emblem into the hill and lit it up at night with the aid of a series of tins filled with oil-soaked rags which were set alight. Years later, the design was lit by electric strip lighting and is illuminated on most evenings throughout the year. Community The town has a Community Centre, a weekly local newspaper and hosts many activities throughout the year. The town has an Australian Rules football team competing in the Western Border Football League. Casterton Football Club, originally formed in 1875, won the Western District League Premiership 12 times between 1892 and 1963 and has won the Western Border League Premiership twice, in 1969 and 1990. The Casterton Racing Club schedules around four horse race meetings a year including the Casterton Cup meeting in May or June. Golfers play at the Casterton Golf Club on Penola Road. The town has a public outdoor swimming pool, a hospital, a secondary college and State and Catholic primary schools.

Gouache and watercolour on paper, 14.9 x 10.2 cm. Private collection Grip was a Toronto, Ontario design firm that was home to many of Canada's premier designers and painters during the first half of the 20th century. The company was founded in 1873 by the cartoonist J. W. Bengough to publish his satirical weekly magazine Grip. Bengough also published chapbooks and did design work and advertising for various clients. He lost control of the company in the 1890s and the magazine ceased publication in 1892. After that date the company became better known as an important design firm, providing artwork, wood cuts, and other services for merchandise and print advertising. In the early 20th century it was technologically and artistically one of the most sophisticated design firms in the country. It was one of the first employers of many of Canada's major artists of the period, and is perhaps most important as where many of the Group of Seven met one another for the first time. In 1906 J.E.H. Macdonald became its head designer. In 1908 Tom Thomson and Frank Johnston joined the firm as two of Macdonald's designers. In 1911 Franklin Carmichael was hired as an office boy. That same year Arthur Lismer crossed the Atlantic to come work for the firm. The year after, Fred Varley made the same journey to work for Grip. The company was later renamed Rapid Grip. Later it became known as Batten, then Bomac Batten, until it was finally purchased by the Laird Group. Grip magazine was briefly revived in 2000 as a satirical quarterly, published by the Toronto-based Lategan Media Group. References *A Caricature History of Canadian Politics.

It was released on June 16, 1998 on BEC Recordings, the Christian imprint of Tooth & Nail Records. This album established Project 86 as one of the more promising hardcore/metal groups in the Christian music scene. According to one critic, Project 86 became \\"one of the few Christian acts to gain exposure to the general market\\" by the turn of the millennium. The album sold over 30,000 copies before the release of the band's second album in the year 2000. Style and content Project 86 features a rap styled vocal delivery over hard-edged, downtuned guitars. While the music itself was not heavily influenced by hip hop, vocalist Andrew Schwab was a fan of the East Coast hip hop scene. Partly due to this influence, and the popularity of rapcore at the time of this album's release, many reviewers classified the album with that genre. Others saw the prominent influence of other hard music genres such as hardcore, metal, and speed punk. Their music, which was said to \\"take passion and intensity to a unique level,\\" was matched with a \\"gloomy lyrical perspective.\\" The closing cut, \\"When Darkness Reigns,\\" exemplifies the form, which one reviewer called a \\"climate of pitch black darkness.\\" Christian reviewers noted that this was introspection, one stating that the lyrics deal with \\"wrestling with the inner man and life core issues.\\" Themes of apathy, guilt, and oppression appear on the album; one reviewer described these as the vocalist as wearing his \\"wounded heart on his ragged sleeve.\\" For his part, Schwab states, \\"there were a lot of things that I was going through, personal struggles, life issues.\\" The same reviewer went on to state that the album wasn't really dark, but \\"merely honest.\\" The music video for their song \\"Pipe Dream\\" received rotation on The Box and later MTV2. The album features Sonny Sandoval of P.O.D. on \\"Six Sirens\\". Frontman Andrew Schwab stated that P.O.D. was an influence and of all Christian bands the one he most respected. \\"The Warriors Tour\\" later featured P.O.D., Project 86, and Blindside. As for rapcore, the band maintains that it was never their intention to become associated with the genre. \\"You wouldn't call Beck a rapper, even though he raps,\\" Schwab once told an interviewer. Guitarist Randy Torres echoed the sentiment, stating, \\"I feel the new wave of rapcore is both predictable and boring\\" in a year 2000 interview. Their follow up effort, Drawing Black Lines, followed and expanded upon the style of \\"Pipe Dream\\" most closely. Originally released for a generic Christian compilation titled Moms Like Us Too Vol. 1 (Tooth & Nail, 1999), there is a separate track titled \\"Numb\\" that is sometimes cited as the 11th track on the B-side of this album. Due to album production dates and its musical similarity to the debut disc, \\"Numb\\" was most likely recorded at the same time, but not included in the main release. In Drawing Black Lines, the final song titled \\"Twenty-Three\\" is most likely named because, with the inclusion of \\"Numb\\", it is the 23rd track released by the band. Project 86 eschewed the label of being a Christian band from the beginning, hoping to avoid stereotyping associated with the genre. In an interview for HM magazine the band stated that many \\"Christian bands\\" bill themselves as such because it is easier to make a successful start in that market. Andrew Schwab continued, \\"One thing we want to do is to be ourselves... were coming at it with more of a creative outlet lyrically. I don't always say specifically what I'm talking about.\\" Even so, the band considers their work to be a ministry. Project 86 seeks to \\"put out the best art possible\\" in the hopes of reaching out to the secular world. \\"If we're playing at Ozzfest or on Family Values...,\\" the band told 7ball after the release of their second album, \\"there is a greater level of tact necessary in order to reach that sort of audience.\\" Track listing All songs were written by Project 86. #\\"Spill Me\\" ‚Äì 5:25 #\\"Rebuttal\\" ‚Äì 4:47 #\\"Pipe Dream\\" ‚Äì 4:35 #\\"Stalemate\\" ‚Äì 6:16 #\\"Run\\" ‚Äì 3:37 #\\"Independence?\\" ‚Äì 4:27 #\\"Six Sirens (ft.

History Dunman's Green was one of the earliest public parks in Singapore, it was named after the first Superintendent of Police Thomas Dunman who retired in 1871. In 1876, it was renamed as Hong Lim Green in honour of Cheang Hong Lim (), a wealthy Chinese Hokkien businessman and philanthropist who bought and donated the land to the government. Police Courts (right), known as the Criminal District and Magistrates' Courts at Hong Lim Green, Singapore, demolished in 1975 In 1885, a Mansard roofed Police Courts building known as the Criminal District and Magistrates' Courts, was built on the grounds of the park. The North Canal Post Office was also built in the area, which was situated closer to the North Canal Road, while the Police Courts building was situated closer to the South Bridge Road. The first Straits Chinese Recreation Club clubhouse was built at the centre of the park, an octagonal pavilion designed by H.D. Richards, was officially opened to members by Chinese consul Tso Ping Lung on 2 July 1887. In 1914, the original clubhouse was demolished for the construction of a new pavilion, which had improved lighting and facilities and had its entrance facing New Bridge Road. Hong Lim Green would start its first storytelling tradition during the Japanese occupation of Singapore in the 1940s. After the war, it was used as a cricket ground by members of the Singapore Chinese Recreation Club and the Singapore Cricket Club, and was also the venue for many of the first political speeches and election rallies in the 1950s and 1960s.https://www.nparks.gov.sg/gardens- parks-and-nature/parks-and-nature-reserves/hong-lim-park With Singapore Chinese Recreation Club vacated the premises on 31 July 1959 and moved to Shenton Way, its former clubhouse's demolition started on the following day to make way for new developments. Hong Lim Green was refurbished by the City Council of Singapore with new grass turf, a sand filled children's playground, a fountain, park facilities, and an open-air theatre was built at a cost of S$173,000, it was renamed to Hong Lim Park and officially reopened by S. Rajaratnam on 23 April 1960. On the following day, the Telok Ayer Hong Lim Green Community Centre, which was behind the open-air theatre, was officially opened by Dr Goh Keng Swee.http://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/data/pdfdoc/lky19600423.pdf The storytelling tradition was once again resumed in another medium as Chinese operas were performed at the open-air theatre from the 1960s to 1970s. The park had also become an attractive location for cultural shows, outdoor movie screenings and election rallies once again in the 1960s to 1970s. In 2005, the Hong Lim Park Open Stage was refurbished to incorporate a modern-looking pure Teflon tentage that preserved the historical stage layout of the 1950s. The Criminal District and Magistrates' Courts, which had remained at the park for 90 years, was demolished soon after the Subordinate Courts was opened for operation on 15 September 1975, the site of the former police courts building is currently an empty field with a toilet facility to cater as part of the event venue. The park's playground had since been removed. The former North Canal Post Office had been renovated and converted into the Kreta Ayer Neighbourhood Police Post in the late 1980s, would also served as a registration centre for anyone who wishes to give speeches or set up events at the Speakers' Corner from September 2000 onwards. Speakers' Corner Hong Lim Park was selected by the government as the venue for Speakers' Corner on 1 September 2000. Since then, it is the only place in Singapore where one can legally stage public protests. In early 2013, two protests against the government's immigration policies each drew more than 350 people, and in June 2014, about 20 people protested the Central Provident Fund (CPF), Singapore's state-run pension fund.

This is the 2nd published book to feature the author‚Äôs primary protagonist Dirk Pitt. Plot introduction Dirk Pitt is summoned from his vacation on the sunny beaches of California and sent to the Arctic when an iceberg is discovered that contains the remains of a missing luxury yacht. The yacht was on its way to a top-secret meeting with the White House; now the entire crew is dead, incinerated at their posts. This discovery sets Pitt on a deadly adventure as he tries to stop a multi-millionaire madman from upsetting the balance of world power and possibly causing the collapse of the world‚Äôs economy. Plot summary While on a routine survey mission of the iceberg fields in the North Atlantic, a United States Coast Guard survey plane discovers what appears to be a ship embedded in an iceberg. The plane marks the iceberg with a red dye marker and then returns to its base to report the discovery. Admiral Sandecker dispatches Dirk Pitt and Dr. Bill Hunnewell of the National Underwater and Marine Agency on a top-secret mission to survey the ship in the iceberg. Pitt concocts an outlandish story about a disappeared Russian spy trawler, supposedly equipped with their latest in technology and codes, in order to commandeer the Coast Guard cutter USCGC Catawaba as a base of operations. In reality they are searching for the yacht Lax, which disappeared mysteriously over a year ago with its billionaire owner, Kristjan Fyrie, and its entire crew while on their way to the United States. When Dirk and the doctor search for the iceberg, they discover that someone has gone to a great deal of effort to erase the dye marker and try to convince them that the iceberg they are looking for is somewhere else by marking a similar iceberg 90 miles to the east. Pitt quickly figures out the trick and they eventually find the correct iceberg and work their way into the derelict ship. Inside they discover that all those on board have been incinerated at their posts by a terrible fire much more severe than should have been possible on the ship of that type. It is revealed that Fyrie has developed a new type of underwater probe using a laboratory created element called Celtinium-279. Using this new probe it is possible to scan the ocean floor from the surface and detect minerals and metals without having to drill. The probe is of enormous value. Unfortunately for the crew the Celtinium-279 proves to be extremely unstable and it ignites causing an incredibly destructive fire, the heat from which eventually allowed the ship to become embedded in the iceberg. After their work on the iceberg is done Pitt and Dr. Hunnewell continue on their trip by helicopter from the Coast Guard cutter toward Reykjav√≠k, Iceland. They are intercepted along the way by a black Lorelei Mark VIII jet and engage in a frantic battle. Pitt earns a pyrrhic victory over the jet causing it to crash by ramming into it with his helicopter which naturally caused it to crash as well. Dr. Hunnewell is severely injured in the crash and dies in Pitt's arms while uttering the cryptic last words \\"God save thee...\\" which it is later revealed are lines from the Rime of the Ancient Mariner intended to give Pitt clues as to who is responsible for Hunnewell's death. After recovering from his injuries, Pitt is assigned by Admiral Sandecker to get close to Kirsti Fyrie, long-lost sister of Kristjan who is now in charge of his companies. Kirsti's fianc√© Oskar Rondheim is a ruthless businessman who appears to be intimidating Fyrie into marrying him in order to take control of her businesses. It is later revealed that Rondheim is actually Carzo Butera, a wanted mobster with many aliases; Rondheim/Butera learned that Kristjan Fyrie underwent secret sex reassignment surgery to become Kirsti, and is using this information to blackmail her and gain control over her empire. Pitt uncovers a shadowy organization known as Hermit Limited, conceived and funded by American billionaire F. James Kelly. The group's goal is to obtain control over Central and South America by secretly buying up all of the major industries in these relatively weak countries. The group intends to employ the domino theory by taking over two countries and turning them into such huge successes that the other countries in the region clamor to join. In order to distract the world during the takeover, Hermit Limited conceived a further plot to kidnap five millionaires and other important people from various countries and fake an air disaster in an uninhabited area of Iceland. While there is an international furor in the press over the disappearance of and eventual discovery of the bodies of the missing people, Hermit Limited will quietly assassinate the leaders of the two countries and assume control. The leaders of the two countries targeted by Hermit Limited, Pablo Castille of the Dominican Republic and Juan De Croix of French Guiana, were in the United States attending a conference in San Francisco for the Alliance of Economic and Agricultural Products. On their way home they stopped to do some sightseeing at Disneyland where Hermit Limited will attempt to assassinate them. Dirk Pitt, who has been stranded with the group of abducted millionaires, manages to escape and make his way to civilization. He commandeers an old Ford tri-motor airplane and rescues the others, who have been left at the mercy of the elements. Barely out of the hospital following this harrowing rescue, Pitt is rushed to Disneyland where he (in guise as the Big Bad Wolf) attempts to save Castille and de Croix, who have slipped away from their security and are enjoying a ride on the Pirates of the Caribbean; he succeeds in foiling Rondheim (disguised as part of the display) with a prop cutlass, breaks Rondheim's legs and arms and turns him over to FBI for trial and execution.

The only part that is state maintained is South 26th Road (on the mainland); Miami-Dade County maintains the Rickenbacker Causeway across the Biscayne Bay and Virginia Key to Key Biscayne. Inside the village of Key Biscayne, the roadway is known as Crandon Boulevard after it crosses Bear Cut. Mile markers are posted along the entire route, with zero at the entrance to Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park at the south end of Crandon Boulevard.  Route description  Crandon Boulevard starts at the entrance to Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park, and serves as a main artery for the village of Key Biscayne. North of the village, the road cuts through Crandon Park, passing by Crandon Beach and the Tennis Center at Crandon Park before it crosses Bear Cut onto Virginia Key, where the road becomes three lanes wide. Bear Cut also marks the southern terminus of the Rickenbacker Causeway and northern terminus of Crandon Boulevard. After arriving on Virginia Key, the road passes by the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, NOAA's Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML), the Miami Seaquarium, MAST Academy (the former site of Planet Ocean), and the Miami Marine Stadium. The William M. Powell Bridge carries traffic over Biscayne Bay. The road passes by more beaches on a short and thin barrier island before it reaches the toll plaza for the southbound Rickenbacker Causeway on the mainland, where state maintenance begins. The road's state road designation ends at I-95, but the road itself continues into Miami's The Roads neighborhood as Southwest 26th Road. Toll on the Rickenbacker Causeway for southbound automobiles is $1.75 for drivers without a C-Pass; northbound vehicles do not stop to pay toll. History Originally, there was no State Road connection between I-95 and Key Biscayne when the Interstate highway was opened in 1967. The southernmost exit of the expressway was a short \\"trunk ramp\\" forming the southwestern end of Southwest 23rd Road at Southwest First Avenue (with the ramps having an at-grade crossing with Florida East Coast Railroad tracks before reaching First Avenue). Southbound traffic for the Miami Seaquarium, beaches, and other tourist attractions along the Rickenbacker Causeway would exit at Southwest 23rd Road, then take Southwest First Avenue to Southwest 25th Road, which would lead (via Brickell Avenue) to the toll booths on the entrance of the Causeway. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the railroad tracks were removed and houses along Southwest First Avenue between Southwest 15th Road and Southwest 12th Avenue were demolished to make room for Metrorail. The removal of this section of Southwest First Avenue resulted in a temporary lack of access of the Rickenbacker Causeway to southbound I-95 motorists (briefly, they were guided to it by way of Southwest Eighth Street (US 41-SR 90) and Brickell Avenue (US 1-SR 5). Ultimately (in the early 1980s), a new partial interchange was built for southbound I-95, this time at Southwest 25th and 26th Roads. This became the primary mode of access to Key Biscayne from the expressway. On the other hand, motorists leaving the Rickenbacker Causeway has had direct access with northbound I-95 and southbound US 1 (Brickell Avenue) with flyover ramps since 1967. In the mid-1980s, newly built sections Southwest and Southeast 26th Road, plus the two flyover ramps, were designated an unsigned State Road 913 and maintained by the Florida Department of Transportation as a state highway.FDOT GIS data Florida Department of Transportation, Official Florida Transportation Map (1989)Rand McNally, Miami Metro map (1995) Dolph Map Company, Map of Metropolitan Miami, Dade County, Florida (1996) FDOT now inventories the causeway and Crandon Boulevard as County Road 913.

The Oxford Dictionary of English lists mofetta as an archaic term for the modern word fumarole. The word is used in the plural as mofette, or, following the French fashion, mofettes. The volcanic vents yielding the emanations are themselves called mofette. They are not uncommon in Auvergne and in the Eifel, notably on the shore of the Laacher See; whilst other examples are furnished by the Grotta del Cane, near Pozzuoli, the Valley of Death in Java, the Death Gulch in the Yellowstone Park and the series of mofette in Romania's Harghita and Covasna counties. Depending on the mineral content of the different vapours, mofette may be used for therapeutic purposes as well. As carbon dioxide is heavier than the air, patients can use it as dry spa, if certain safety regulations are complied with. The first known record about mofetta treatment for injuries is from the sixteenth century, by Paracelsus.

Presentation Vesicovaginal fistula, or VVF, is an abnormal fistulous tract extending between the bladder (vesica) and the vagina that allows the continuous involuntary discharge of urine into the vaginal vault. In addition to the medical sequela from these fistulas, they often have a profound effect on the patient's emotional well-being. Causes It may be the result of a congenital birth condition such as VATER or VACTERL. It is often caused by childbirth (in which case it is known as an obstetric fistula), when a prolonged labor presses the unborn child tightly against the pelvis, cutting off blood flow to the vesicovaginal wall. The affected tissue may necrotize (die), leaving a hole. Vaginal fistulas can also result from particularly violent cases of rape, especially those involving multiple rapists and/or foreign objects. Some health centers in countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo have begun to specialize in the surgical repair of vaginal fistulas.It can also be associated with hysterectomy, cancer operations, radiation therapy and cone biopsy. Treatment Vesicovaginal fistulae are typically repaired either transvaginally or laparoscopically, although patients who have had multiple transvaginal procedures sometimes attempt a final repair through a large abdominal incision, or laparotomy. The laparoscopic (minimally invasive) approach to VVF repair has become more prevalent due to its greater visualization, higher success rate, and lower rate of complications. =Possible complications of surgical treatment= * Recurrent formation of the fistula * Injury to ureter, bowel, or intestines * Vaginal shortening History Before the 19th century, women who suffered from VVF were judged harshly and rejected by society. Throughout the 19th century, treatment for VVF was limited because the practice of gynecology was perceived as taboo. Doctors were almost entirely male at this time and looking at a nude female, even for medical purposes, was seen as divergent from 19th- century values. One of the most famous gynecological surgeons of this time was Dr. J Marion Sims, who developed a successful technique for treating VVF in the mid-1800s, for which he is hailed as a pioneer of gynecology. Black enslaved women in the American South were particularly prone to VVF because they were denied proper nutrients and medical care. Sims performed on these women without anesthesia, which had not been introduced until after he started his experiments, and which in its infancy Dr. Sims hesitated to use. (Ether anesthesia was publicly demonstrated in Boston in 1846, a year after Sims began his experimentation.) Sims did not have a white female patient until he made ether available to them, although he publicly noted that he never resorted to using anesthetics because he believed that the pain did not justify the risks. A detailed case study of Dr. Sims even discusses the case of a white woman who underwent three operations, all without anesthesia. It was considered acceptable to operate on them without anesthetic because, Sims claimed, African-American women have a naturally higher pain tolerance. The healing process of the VVF procedure is still arduous. To have a successful recovery from the surgery, it must be successful on the first attempt.

He played 350 games, with the Wests (1980‚Äì1983) and Canterbury (1984‚Äì1996). Lamb was known for his support of the ball-carrier - his ability to be in the right place at the right time netted him 164 tries. This earned him the moniker of \\"The Back- up Man\\". He also kicked 386 goals and 44 field goals, for 1,442 points in first grade. He played for New South Wales in State of Origin and Australia. Lamb is the only player to appear in every match of a Kangaroo Tour. Junior career Lamb grew up in Chester Hill, a suburb in the Bankstown area and attended Sefton High School. Lamb played all his junior rugby league for the Chester Hill Hornets club during the years 1967-1979 where he won multiple Best and Fairest awards. He only played in one Grand Final when he filled in for a side above his age group. Lamb is the only International to come from the Chester Hill Hornets club and the ground is now named the Terry Lamb Complex in his honour. Lamb represented Canterbury in junior representative sides, but signed his first professional contract with Western Suburbs Magpies. Western Suburbs Magpies career Lamb was a non-playing reserve for the Canterbury Third Grade side in 1979 and was hopeful of a contract with his junior side in 1980. Lamb was told the best he could hope for was a position in the Presidents Cup (Under 21s) side. On 18 May 1980, Lamb made his first grade premiership debut for Western Suburbs against Balmain Tigers at Lidcombe Oval. Lamb scored two tries in the Magpies' comprehensive 26-4 victory. Lamb scored 9 tries in his debut season and was edged out for the inaugural Dally M Rookie of the Year award by teammate Jim Leis who would go on the Australian 1980 Tour of New Zealand. Lamb formed a great scrumbase combination that season with Alan Neil. Lamb's form in the early stages of the 1981 season was outstanding and he was selected in the NSW State of Origin side. Lamb was called in at the last moment for a very ill Mick Pattison and only arrived in Brisbane on the day of the match (when Pattison took ill, NSW coach Ted Glossop initially wanted to move Steve Rogers from the centres to five-eighth and play whoever the league gave him as a replacement back from the bench but was overruled by the NSWRL. Lamb, who at the time worked as a linesman for Telecom, was literally found up a telegraph pole and had to make a rushed flight to Brisbane). Lamb met his halves partner, young Parramatta halfback Peter Sterling, for the first time only two hours before kickoff. Lamb made his Origin debut at Lang Park playing opposite another young player on the rise, Queensland captain Wally Lewis who had made his test debut against France only a few weeks earlier. NSW led 15‚Äì5 at half time mostly due to the Parramatta connection of Sterling, Ray Price, Michael Cronin and Eric Grothe who picked up a loose Greg Conescu pass to race 90 metres to score in the first half. But the Maroons, led by Lewis and man of the match Chris Close, came back strong in the second half to win 22‚Äì15. The 1982 season was a successful one for Wests and Lamb where his end of season form caught the eyes of the Australian selectors and he was selected for the 1982 Kangaroo tour. Lamb ruled himself out of the tour as he already planned to marry his partner Kim. The Kangaroos swept all before them on the tour going through undefeated for the first time and becoming known as \\"The Invincibles\\". Lamb's final season with Wests was in 1983 where the Magpies won the dreaded wooden spoon prize. In spite of this, he was awarded the Dally M Player of the Year Award. His prize winnings of $9,000 that night was $500 more than his contract that season. Terry Lamb made 88 appearances for Wests, Lamb was later named as halfback in the Western Suburbs Magpies Team of the Eighties. Joining the Bulldogs and early success The news that Lamb's Dally M winnings was more than his contract ensured that he would be in hot demand from the richer Sydney clubs now that he was out of contract and that Wests were at first expelled from the premiership. Easts and Balmain both showed interest but eventually Lamb chose the Bulldogs, joining in 1984.Bulldogs.com.au - Terry Lamb Lamb settled nicely into Canterbury under the coaching of Warren Ryan and playing outside Steve Mortimer. Lamb's arrival did cause initial controversy when long-serving five-eighth Garry Hughes was dropped to reserve grade in what was to be his final season. Lamb's ability to back up the ball-carrier came to the fore as he was the Sydney Premiership's joint leading tryscorer with 17.http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/seasons/NSWRL_1984/summary.html Lamb won a recall to the New South Wales State of Origin side for the 2nd match. He played well enough to be retained for the 3rd match despite the Blues losing, but withdrew due to injury. Lamb never won a junior premiership and he was closing in on one at senior level when the Bulldogs made the 1984 Grand Final against arch-rivals Parramatta Eels who were looking to win their fourth successive title. Canterbury took out the Grand Final 6‚Äì4 in a bruising game of football. Lamb was replaced with five minutes remaining due to a nasty gash above his eye. In 1985, Lamb played 22 games for the Bulldogs, but was forced to miss the 1985 Grand Final due to a groin injury. Michael Hagan was named as his replacement.http://thebulldogs.com.au/sportal.php?page=player&id;=477 Canterbury defeated St. George Dragons 7‚Äì6 to make it back-to-back titles. 1986 was an eventful year for Lamb. He played much of the opening rounds at halfback with captain Steve Mortimer suspended, and was recalled to the New South Wales State of Origin side. He was selected in all three matches from the bench and went on to be selected in the Australian Test side for the opening match against New Zealand. Lamb came on from the bench as a replacement for Dale Shearer. Lamb got more time in the 3rd Test when he came as a replacement for the injured Wayne Pearce playing lock forward. His good form at Canterbury continued with the Bulldogs making a third successive Grand Final, once again playing Parramatta Eels. Lamb was the leading pointscorer for the season, and he would end up scoring 210 points.http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/seasons/NSWRL_1986/summary.html However, he missed a difficult penalty goal attempt in the final three minutes of the 1986 Grand Final. The Eels won 4‚Äì2. Lamb was then selected to go on the Kangaroo Tour. In March 1987, Lamb scored all of Canterbury's 26 points as they beat Wests 26‚Äì16 in round 4. Lamb's points haul were made up of four tries and five goals. He again finished the season as the leagues leading try- scorerhttp://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/seasons/NSWRL_1987/summary.html however, the club failed to make the finals, finishing 6th in what would prove to be Warren Ryan's last season as coach. Warren Ryan departed Canterbury at the end of 1987 with reserve grade coach Phil Gould taking over the reins in a caretaker role with Chris Anderson being groomed for the top position. The 1988 season was Lamb's fifth at Canterbury and the first he wouldn't cross the line at least 10 times. Lamb played a very important role in Canterbury's season as former captain Steve Mortimer missed a large chunk of the season due to injuries. Hanley incident and the World Cup Canterbury played the 1988 Grand Final against Balmain, a game which the Bulldogs won 24‚Äì12. As well as scoring a try, Terry Lamb was involved in a first-half tackle, along with Andrew Farrar, which resulted in the concussion of influential Balmain star, Ellery Hanley. Hanley was sent to the head bin, and although he managed to return to the field before half-time, he did not appear fully aware of his surroundings, and was replaced at half-time. Lamb says that there was no malice, and Hanley was not deliberately targeted. In the 1988 World Cup Final against New Zealand, Lamb was named as a substitute. He was called into action in the first half after Wally Lewis broke his arm in a tackle. Captain of the Bulldogs One of the first jobs that new coach Chris Anderson did was appoint Lamb as captain ahead of Paul Langmack and Andrew Farrar, who were commonly the deputies when Peter Tunks (who joined Penrith Panthers in 1990) was unavailable. The Bulldogs lost Paul Langmack, Andrew Farrar, David Gillespie and Joe Thomas to Wests under former dual premiership-winning coach Warren Ryan. The club also lost Paul Dunn to Penrith and Jason Alchin to St George. Lamb made himself unavailable for the 1990 Kangaroo Tour despite the controversial omission of Wally Lewis. Cliff Lyons and Kevin Walters were both selected once Lamb confirmed his unavailability. A chronic groin injury would dog Lamb for the next few seasons. Lamb would be a week-to-week proposition throughout the 1990s. Despite the departures from Canterbury at the end of the season, in 1991 they qualified in equal 5th position but went down 19‚Äì14 against arch-rivals Wests. The club under the leadership of Lamb developed as a competitive force. Lamb was captain to a new generation of players coming through the club who would play a big part in the club's successful years ahead including Darren Smith, Dean Pay, Simon Gillies, Matthew Ryan and 1991 Rothmans Medal Winner Ewan McGrady. The 1991 season was the only time Lamb would be suspended throughout his career when he was sent off for an alleged headbutt on Manly's Geoff Toovey. He received four weeks for the offence. Lamb missed the first five matches in 1992 but when he returned he enjoyed one of his finest individual seasons where Canterbury started to be tagged a 'one-man team'. Lamb lifted the Bulldogs to the brink of the semi-finals before once again making himself unavailable as the 1992 World Cup loomed. Lamb came 2nd in the Dally M Awards for 1992. A new wave of signings joined the Bulldogs in 1993 and the team that Lamb and Anderson moulded was coming to fruition. The Bulldogs won the Minor Premiership with Lamb making it a hat-trick of Dally M Five-Eighth of the Year awards and Anderson winning Dally M Coach of the Year. Canterbury crashed out in the semi-finals but it was a great effort by the club to get to a position of strength after being warm favourites for the 1991 Wooden Spoon. Lamb broke his arm in 1994 when playing his 299th first grade match against Wests. Lamb would return to play his 300th match against Souths playing at Concord Oval and wearing the No.55 jumper. Concord was only used for three League games and Lamb wore No.55 as he was a late inclusion into the side. Lamb broke the record previously held by Geoff Gerard in the final round, which ironically was against his former club Wests at Campbelltown with both Canterbury and Wests jointly celebrating the occasion. Canterbury with their victory in Lamb's 304th first grade game won the Minor Premiership and defeated Canberra in the Major Semi-Final. The Raiders however won the Grand Final 36‚Äì12. 1995 Grand Final The 1995 season was to be Lamb's last season and the Bulldogs were keen to send him out a winner but it all went wrong early when the Bulldogs were caught up in the firing line of the Super League War. Lamb's strength and character as a captain shone through when he held the club together and rallied everyone (bar one) in the latter half of the season. Canterbury qualified in 6th position for the ARL Finals Series. The Bulldogs defeated St George, Brisbane and defending premiers Canberra to make the Grand Final against Manly. Canterbury were never headed in the Grand Final defeating Manly 17‚Äì4 in the decider with Lamb plotting a crucial drop-goal to give them a seven-point lead. Lamb spent 10 minutes in the sin bin but that didn't stop his performance as he steered Canterbury to an impressive victory. It was a sweet moment for Lamb and coach Chris Anderson after five years of planning went into this moment. The 1995 Grand Final was also the swansong for Chief Executive Peter Moore who retired from his post after 26 years of service. Moore would remain a member of the Canterbury Leagues Club board until 1998. Lamb's planned retirement was shelved as he helped his beloved club for one more season to get through a sudden player departure caused by the Super League War. Lamb didn't seek the captaincy with Simon Gillies taking on that role and when Gillies was injured for the second half of the season, Lamb again opted not to be captain with Darren Britt taking the reins (in a sign of things to come). Lamb's career wound down on 25 August 1996, when Canterbury defeated North Queensland 50‚Äì22 at Belmore Sports Ground. Lamb scored two tries an that the start and end of his career saw him score a double. The finest support player the game has seen played a record 350 first grade games (88 at Western Suburbs, 262 at Canterbury-Bankstown). He also scored 164 first grade tries, a mark bettered only by Andrew Ettingshausen (165), Steve Menzies (180) and Ken Irvine (212). In a strange twist, with Manly having reached (and won) the 2008 NRL Grand Final, Menzies ended his career in Australia having equalled Lamb's league record of 349 games in his last match. The 34-year-old veteran of 15 NRL seasons then signed a contract to play the 2009 season and beyond with Super League club, the Bradford Bulls. In anticipation of equalling Lamb's record with his final appearance, Manly was reported to have made Menzies an offer to make a cameo appearance in 2009 to break the record. Menzies' response confirmed his and Lamb's standing among the greats: \\"I wouldn't consider coming back for one game and cheapening the record or anything,\\" said Menzies. \\"If I fell one short or equalled it or whatever then that's my career and the way it finishes. \\"(Lamb) was such a great player ... I'm very honoured to stand next to him. Lamb set many records at Canterbury with the last one, a landmark of 123 tries being broken by winger Hazem El Masri, against the Newcastle Knights in 2006. Lamb would be acknowledged in 2004 as the Canterbury and captain in their 70-years greatest side. 349 or 350? In August 2011, Darren Lockyer played his 350th game and was awarded with breaking the record (349 games, jointly held by Lamb, according to the NRL) for most games played. However a website which compiles player and team statistics, RugbyLeagueProject has checked the list of games played and found that while the numbers for Wests tally, it appears that Lamb played an additional game in 1986 in Round 1, where he came off the bench to play. Official records in those days were erratic regarding interchange players and it was this match that had been overlooked. After working with the NRL, RugbyLeagueProject submitted all their evidence and the official record was changed to show that Lamb had indeed become the first player to reach 350 Premiership games.

The children who play this disappear, believed to be spirited away by demons. Kakurenbo follows Hikora, a boy who joins the game with hopes of finding his missing sister, Sorincha.

He studied at Georgetown University, and has conducted the majority of his research at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. Many advances in molecular neuroscience have stemmed from Snyder's identification of receptors for neurotransmitters and drugs, and elucidation of the actions of psychotropic agents. He received the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research in 1978 for his research on the opioid receptor, and is one of the most highly cited researchers in the biological and biomedical sciences, with the highest h-index in those fields for the years 1983‚Äì2002, and then from 2007‚Äì2019.  Biography  = Personal life = Solomon Snyder was born on December 26, 1938 in Washington D.C. He is one of five children. Snyder and his wife Elaine, who died in 2015, have two daughters and three grandchildren. He lives in Baltimore, Maryland. = Education and early career = Snyder attended Georgetown University from 1955 to 1958 and received his M.D. degree from Georgetown University School of Medicine in 1962. After a medical residency at the Kaiser Hospital in San Francisco, he served as a research associate from 1963 to 1965 at the National Institutes of Health, where he studied under Julius Axelrod. Snyder moved to the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine to complete his residency in psychiatry from 1965 to 1968. He was appointed to the faculty there in 1966 as Assistant Professor of Pharmacology. In 1968 he was promoted to Associate Professor of Pharmacology and Psychiatry and in 1970 to Full Professor in both departments. His laboratory is noted for the use of receptor binding studies to characterize the actions of neurotransmitters and psychoactive drugs. He is also known for his work identifying receptors for the major neurotransmitters in the brain, and in the process explaining the actions of psychoactive drugs, such as the blockade of dopamine receptors by antipsychotic medications. He has described novel neurotransmitters, such as the gases nitric oxide and carbon monoxide and the D-isomers of amino acids, including D-serine. = Later career = Snyder is University Distinguished Service Professor of Neuroscience, Pharmacology, and Psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. In 1980, he founded the Department of Neuroscience, and served as its first director from 1980 to 2006. In 2006, the department was renamed as The Solomon H.

It is a story of forbidden love between a developmentally-handicapped young man and a sorority girl. The film was directed by Anthony Abrams and Adam Larson Broder and written by Broder. Plot Carolyn McDuffy is a privileged college senior beginning her last year of studies at an elite Southern California university. In an effort to help her sorority win a coveted award that has eluded them in the past years, Carolyn joins them in training some handicapped young adults for the Challenged Games (a fictional version of the Special Olympics). Carolyn is paired with Jesse \\"Pumpkin\\" Romanoff, and is horrified, mostly because she has never been in such an environment. Pumpkin is kind towards her and soon she finds herself developing affection toward him because he is genuine, unlike her boyfriend Kent Woodlands, or her sorority sisters, as led by Julie Thurber. Carolyn experiences backlash and disdain about the relationship from her friends and family, including Pumpkin's own mother, Judy, despite the fact that Carolyn's love has inspired Pumpkin to get out of his wheelchair and become the best athlete on the team. Judy later walks into her son's room and discovers that Carolyn and Pumpkin have been sexually involved. Pumpkin's mother accuses her of raping her son, claiming Carolyn \\"has no idea what she has done\\" to Pumpkin. Pumpkin's mother calls Carolyn's school, causing Carolyn to be kicked out of both her sorority and expelled from the university. Carolyn makes a suicide attempt by taking most of the pills and solutions from her medicine cabinet, but survives after vomiting the substances. After hearing of Carolyn's suicide attempt, the sorority convinces the university to allow her back in, and she is invited to attend a sorority ball with Kent; Julie feels the couple's attendance will help the sorority secure their award. At the ball, Pumpkin and his friends crash the party to allow Pumpkin a dance with Carolyn. Kent confronts Pumpkin and punches him repeatedly, who responds by tackling Kent to the ground, temporarily knocking him unconscious. Humiliated, Kent leaves the dance. Carolyn tries to take Pumpkin inside to the dance, but Julie and the sorority sisters block the door. Carolyn pushes her way through with Pumpkin and they dance alone. Soon, other attendees are impelled to join them on the dance floor. Kent leaves the dance in his car, sobbing and driving erratically. He swerves to avoid a truck and plunges off a cliff with the car exploding in mid-air, crashing to the bottom. Carolyn goes to the hospital to check on Kent and finds that he is now paraplegic, though not burned from the explosion. He blames Carolyn for his problems and she is left distraught. Carolyn drops out of college, swearing off Pumpkin forever. The sorority stops helping the team and their rival sorority wins the award. Carolyn enrolls at a public university, opening up to her peers who encourage her. The sorority sisters have a change of heart and show up at the Olympic event. Kent is now the coach for Pumpkin's team and has become both a motivator and humble person. Pumpkin races his rival, a bully who berates Pumpkin at every chance given. Pumpkin is motivated by Kent, telling him to win it for Carolyn and saying she wouldn't want him to lose. As he is running, he sees Carolyn in the stands and gets a sudden boost of energy. Pumpkin wins the race, and at the finish line is congratulated by the sorority sisters, his mother, and Kent. Carolyn comes down to see Pumpkin as his mother is hugging him. She endears him to Carolyn, finally accepting her son's progress into a man. As Carolyn and Pumpkin walk off together, she asks him what name she should call him, and he replies that \\"Pumpkin will be fine.\\" Carolyn glances back at those behind her with an ambiguous expression before continuing ahead. Cast Reception =Critical response= Pumpkin received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes 47 of 74 reviews compiled were negative, resulting in a score of 36%, and an average rating of 4.9/10. On Metacritic the film has a core of 46% based on reviews from 24 critics.https://www.metacritic.com/movie/pumpkin One of the most positive reviews was by Roger Ebert for the Chicago Sun-Times; he wrote, \\"Pumpkin is alive, and takes chances, and uses the wicked blade of satire in order to show up the complacent political correctness of other movies in its campus genre.\\"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/pumpkin-2002 Michael O'Sullivan of the Washington Post also approved of the film, calling it \\"an odd and oddly endearing romantic black comedy.\\" On the other end of the spectrum, Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote that the film \\"gets along on curiosity value for a while, but becomes increasingly unconvincing and ludicrous as it staggers endlessly toward the finish line.\\" =Box office and DVD= Pumpkin opened in American theatres on June 28, 2002, in a limited release. It grossed $30,514 in eight theatres in its first weekend, with a per-screen-average of $3,814. The film expanded to 19 theatres the following weekend, but its theatre count declined from there. Pumpkin completed its theatrical run four months later with a final gross of $308,552. Since its DVD release, the film has become a cult hit. It is often recognized as one of the first examples of genre bending.

The majority of books were hand-copied until the Edo period (1603‚Äì1867), when woodblock printing became comparatively affordable and widespread. Movable- type printing had been used from the late 16th century, but for various aesthetic and practical reasons woodblock printing and hand-copied remained dominant until much later. Japanese equivalents for \\"book\\" include Êú¨ (hon) and Êõ∏Á±ç (shoseki). The former term indicates only bound books, and does not include scrolls. The latter is used for printed matter only. The most general term is Êõ∏Áâ© (shomotsu), which means all written or printed matter that has been collected into a single unit, regardless of construction.  Book composition  Japanese books were traditionally made of washi, or Japanese paper. This durable, fibrous paper does not easily yellow or become brittle with age, which has contributed to the remarkable preservation of early books. Western- style wood-pulp paper became dominant beginning in the Meiji period (1868‚Äì1912), and washi is very rarely used for printing in Japan today. = Binding methods = Japanese Orihon - concertina Fukuro toji binding Japanese bookmakers used a great variety of different methods for constructing books, depending on time period and whether the book was hand-copied or printed.  Pre-binding books  *; Kansubon (Â∑ªÂ≠êÊú¨), a.k.a. Makimono (Â∑ªÁâ©), or \\"scrolls\\": This early form of bookbinding is almost identical to Western scrolls. These kansubon are not constructed of a single, continuous piece of paper, but rather a number of pages arranged horizontally and glued together along their vertical edges. This binding method was used almost exclusively for hand- copied manuscripts, and is now rarely used. *;Orihon (ÊäòÊú¨), or \\"folding books\\": Orihon are similar to kansubon in that they consist of individual sheets of paper arranged horizontally and glued together, but instead of being rolled for storage, these books are creased at regular intervals and folded accordion-style. Folding books were most commonly used for hand-copied manuscripts, but a certain number of modern, printed books continue to be published in orihon style. This concertina-style binding was more portable than the scroll, and is thought to have been inspired by palm-leaf books which were carried along Indian and Chinese trade routes. Traditionally, the Japanese orihon featured Buddhist scriptures with images and text on only one side. However, some orihon, typically those featuring calligraphy and paintings, were pasted together so that both sides could be utilized.  Bound books  *; Detch≈çs≈ç (Á≤òËëâË£Ö), or \\"glued books\\": To create these books, binders took a double-wide piece of paper and folded it vertically to create a single, connected piece of paper with four printable sides. A number of these folded pages would then be stacked and bound together by applying glue to the creased edges, the front page, and the back page, then mounting the glued surfaces with a cover made from a continuous piece of paper. This binding method was used primarily for hand-copied manuscripts. * *; Tetsuy≈çs≈ç (Á∂¥ËëâË£Ö), or \\"sewn books\\": Like glued books, these sewn books consist of double-wide paper folded to ordinary page width. Unlike glued books, however, in making sewn books, binders made stacks of approximately five double-wide sheets and then folded them. A number of these packets of folded sheets would then be sewn together along the creases. No additional covering paper was applied to reinforce the book or hide the stitching; relevant information was written directly on the first and last page. This style was used primarily for hand- copied manuscripts. * *;Fukuro toji (Ë¢ãÁ∂¥„Åò), or \\"bound-pocket books\\": Bound- pocket books are also made by stacking sheets of double-wide paper that have been folded individually, but unlike glued or sewn books, the stacked pages are bound by sewing the loose edge opposite the crease together with either thread or tightly wrapped, thread-like strips paper. A front and back cover are applied before binding. This binding method means that each double-wide piece of paper has only two printing surfaces instead of four, but by eliminating the need for double-sided legibility, bound-pocket books enabled publishers to use significantly thinner paper than was necessary for glued or sewn books. This binding style also allowed for a much greater variety of appearance than either of the other forms of bound books, as the pages could be sewn according to any number of traditional and fashionable methods. Fukuro toji binding was used primarily for printed books. Approximately 90 percent of Edo-period books were bound using this \\"bound-pocket\\" style. Book sizes Edo period paper came in several standard sizes; the size of books was, accordingly, standard. Though there are surely exceptions, larger books generally contained more formal, serious, material, while smaller books were less formal and less serious. For example, many manuscript copies of scholarly texts are found in the ≈çbon size, while satirical novels were often produced in smaller sizes. * ≈åbon (Â§ßÊú¨, \\"large books\\"), roughly , and ch≈´bon (‰∏≠Êú¨, \\"medium books\\"), which are roughly half that size, were made using Mino paper, which was roughly inches in size. * Hanshi-bon (ÂçäÁ¥ôÊú¨, \\"half paper books\\"), roughly , and kobon (Â∞èÊú¨, \\"small books\\"), roughly , were made from paper roughly wide. * Yotsuhanbon (ÂõõÂçäÊú¨, \\"one-quarter books\\") was perhaps the most common size, with the closed book being 1/4 the size of a full sheet of paper. * Mutsuhanbon (ÂÖ≠ÂçäÊú¨, \\"one-sixth books\\"), also known as masugata-bon (Êû°ÂΩ¢Êú¨, \\"square books\\"), are 1/6 the size of a full sheet of paper, and are square when closed. * Yokohon (Ê®™Êú¨, \\"horizontal books\\") are 1/8 the size of a full sheet of paper when closed (that is, the same width as a yotsuhan book, but half as high). Unlike most other formats, yokohon are wider than they are high, resulting in a long and narrow horizontal form when open.  Printing history  Japan has had a long history of printing that has included a variety of different methods and technologies, but until the Edo period most books were still copied by hand. There were many types of printings: woodblock printing was the most popular publishing style, hand-copied printing were less popular and recognized as private publishing together with movable-type printing. The latter were used to print academic and Buddhist printing and one which was banned in woodblock printing. In the printing which used the kana syllabary before the Meiji period, the letters aimed to mimic the hand-written calligraphic style and often resulted in near-perfect imitations that are difficult to distinguish from actual hand-copied works. The first Japanese printed book was the Diamond Sutra. = Nara Period (710‚Äì794) = Printing began in Japan in the Nara period with the creation of a remarkable piece of Buddhist material called the Hyakumant≈ç Darani (Áôæ‰∏áÂ°îÈôÄÁæÖÂ∞º), or the Million Dharani Towers. Empress K≈çken reputedly printed one million copies of a specific dharani, or Buddhist chant, from 764 to 770 AD. and placed each individual copy inside a foot-tall three-level wooden pagoda. She then dispersed these pagodas to temples all over Japan, where they served devotional purposes. These dharani were printed using the basic woodblock printing technique called seihanbon (Êï¥ÁâàÊú¨) that Buddhist monks brought over from mainland China. The cost of this venture was enormous, and even smaller- scale book reproduction projects could not afford to make use of this printing technique. As a result, the production and distribution of books continued to rely heavily on hand-copying manuscripts. = Heian (794‚Äì1185) and Kamakura (1185‚Äì1333) Periods = Printing technology made very little progress during these periods, but the seihanbon woodblock-printing method did become comparatively affordable and widespread. Large Buddhist temple complexes began producing printed copies of sutras for the devotional use of monks studying at these locations. Sutras printed using this particular variant of seihanbon printing are called kasugaban (Êò•Êó•Áâà, Kasuga editions), named after the famous Buddhist mountain Mt. Kasuga in modern-day Nara Prefecture. K≈çfuku Temple in the Yamato state (now Nara prefecture) was perhaps the largest producer of these documents, but other similarly sized temple complexes also produced similar texts. As before, the cost of undertaking a printing project using this method remained out of the reach of any individual or institution smaller than these great temples, so books were still primarily reproduced by hand. = Muromachi Period (1336‚Äì1573) = The Muromachi period saw a continuation of the printing precedents established with the Kasuga editions of the Heian and Kamakura periods. Books continued to be printed using seihanbon woodblock techniques, and printed matter continued to be limited to sutras and religious texts for the aid and edification of monks at large temples. The most important variant to the established printing system that came out of this period is the Gozanban (‰∫îÂ±±Áâà, Five-mountain edition). This edition receives its name from the printing practices unique to the five most important temples in Kyoto (Kench≈ç-ji Âª∫Èï∑ÂØ∫, Enkaku-ji ÂÜÜË¶öÂØ∫, Jufuku-ji ÂØøÁ¶èÂØ∫, J≈çchi-ji ÊµÑÊô∫ÂØ∫, and J≈çmy≈ç-ji ÊµÑÂ¶ôÂØ∫), as selected by the Muromachi bakufu government. Printing did not become significantly more affordable during this period, so printing remained limited to large temple institutions. = The early-modern printing revolution = Japanese bookseller from the Jinrin kinmo zui (An Illustrated Encyclopedia of Humanity) from 1690 Two different new printing methods came to Japan almost simultaneously at the end of the 16th and beginning of the 17th centuries, techniques that originated from widely divergent sources and were used for similarly diverse purposes. One of these methods, called Ch≈çsen kokatsuji (ÊúùÈÆÆÂè§Ê¥ªÂ≠ó, Old Korean type) and was originally developed in Goryeo, was brought back from Joseon dynasty after Toyotomi Hideyoshi's military invasions of that country in 1592 and 1597. In this technique, printers took flats of extremely tightly packed sand and carved characters into the surface. This surprisingly durable mold was then filled with molten lead, which, after cooling, could be removed and used as type. This innovation in printing technology drastically lowered the cost of printing, as materials could easily be reused any number of times; the sand could be repacked and recarved, while the soft lead could affordably be remelted as many times as necessary. Printing was now more affordable than it had ever been, but even so the sheer capital necessary to purchase the requisite materials and find people appropriately familiar with the technique meant that the majority of books printed in this manner were official commissions from the emperor or the sh≈çgun. These people were unwilling to waste time and money on fiction and other morally suspicious works, instead ordering the publication of official histories and politically valuable texts that had previously only been available in manuscript editions. Emperor Goy≈çzei's (ÂæåÈôΩÊàêÂ§©Áöá) publication of the Nihon Shoki (Êó•Êú¨Êõ∏Á¥Ä) in 1599 was among the first of these books, followed later by Tokugawa Ieyasu's (Âæ≥Â∑ùÂÆ∂Â∫∑) 1616 publication of the Gunsho chiy≈ç (Áæ§Êõ∏Ê≤ªË¶Å). The advent of Catholic missionaries in 1549 was to have lasting effect on Japanese bookmaking, as a certain number of these missionaries was sufficiently knowledgeable of Gutenberg's printing methods to be able to reproduce them in Japan. Missionaries associated with St. Francis Xavier's Society of Jesus began producing books using the Gutenberg press toward the end of the 16th century, more or less contemporaneously with the Ch≈çsen kokatsuji publications. Books printed using the Gutenberg technique were called Kirishitanban („Ç≠„É™„Ç∑„Çø„É≥Áâà, Christian editions). This method is, like the Ch≈çsen kokatsuji, relatively affordable and durable. However, the specialized knowledge necessary and the close association of the technology with Christianity meant that the process did not become extremely widespread. The first books published in this fashion were romanized Japanese translations of western works that the missionaries knew well. These versions were valuable tools for learning the Japanese language, as they afforded missionaries an opportunity to become familiar with the Japanese language without interacting with the complex Japanese orthographical systems. The first such work was a translation of Aesop's Fables, (ESOPO NO FABVLAS) published in 1593. This publication was exceedingly influential, as it was both the first piece of literature to be published in Japan and the country's first introduction to western literature. Japan's first native-born movable-type technique began shortly after these two imported publication methods arrived in the country. An extremely wealthy resident of the Saga (Kyoto district) district of Kyoto named Suminokura Soan (ËßíÂÄâÁ¥†Â∫µ, 1571‚Äì1632) pioneered a form of hand-carved wooden movable type using the skills of the famous craftsman Hon'ami K≈çetsu (Êú¨ÈòøÂº•ÂÖâÊÇ¶, 1558‚Äì1637) and his disciples. Called Sagabon (ÂµØÂ≥®Êú¨, Saga books), these are widely considered the most beautiful books in the history of Japanese printing. They are also some of the most rare, however, as Suminokura used this technique largely to make copies of books for his own personal enjoyment, not for widespread use. These books were made with great care using the tetsuy≈çs≈ç sewn-book binding technique to mimic the manuscript style. Saga books also used a highly decorative type of paper called karakami (ÂîêÁ¥ô, Chinese paper), which contributed to their unique beauty. The dominant method of book reproduction in this time changed from manuscript copying to seihanbon woodblock printing, as this technique had been refined to the point that individual commercial institutions could afford to open their own presses. = Meiji period (1868‚Äì1912) and beyond = Woodblock printing remained the primary form of printing until the Meiji period, when publishers began to use affordable western-style movable type technologies. At the beginning of the Meiji Restoration, publishers made a conscious effort to follow western book models, abandoning the majority of traditional Japanese printing conventions and trademarks, such as the use of washi, classical binding techniques, and calligraphic-style print. This new style of book creation essentially eliminated the traditional Japanese book as such, although small-scale historical reproductions are still created using older techniques. =Today= The modern Japanese book differs little from the western book in construction. However, most books are printed to be read top-to-bottom and right-to-left, which includes manga, a prominent part of Japanese culture today. The notable exception in arrangement is various technical books and textbooks, which tend to be printed according to the western model and are read left-to-right and top-to-bottom.

It is located east of Quito, in the Tumbaco Valley northwest of the Ilal√≥ volcano, in the San Pedro River valley, a tributary of the Guayllabamba River.  Climate  At an elevation of 2200 m (7200 ft) above sea leve, lower than Quito, its climate is about 2 to 5 degrees Celsius warmer. Weather is semi tropical year-round, with a short rainy season.  Developments  In the years up to 2008, the parish has become a commuter town of Quito as a significant number of middle-upper and higher class families moved from the city to live a more suburban lifestyle. A significant amount of expensive and luxurious properties of Quito can be found in Cumbaya making it the highest income area in the country. This shift in population has attracted investors and entrepreneurs to the area, boosting the local economy. In 2017 there has been commercial activity centered around restaurants ranging from food trucks to gourmet-style places. The town is also characterized by many gated communities that vary in size and wealth. Cumbay√° has become home to the main campus of the Universidad San Francisco de Quito. International students of the campus are placed in host families in Quito for cultural immersion. Quorum Quito, built in the late eighties and located in Paseo San Francisco in the Cumbay√° Valley gathered parliamentarians from all over the world at the assemblee of the Interparliamentary Union in 2013.  Architecture  Examples of architecture drawing from the area's rural beginnings include the Iglesia de Cumbay√° in the Main Square and the Iglesia de Miravalle built in 1987. Modern examples include the Rancho San Francisco complex, Paseo San Francisco, La Esquina, Centro Plaza, Scala and Villa Cumbay√° shopping centers, among new office blocks.  Traffic and tourism  The T√∫nel Oswaldo Guayasam√≠n, named after the revered Quito born painter and sculptor Oswaldo Guayasam√≠n, is the longest vehicular tunnel in Ecuador at 1.5 kilometres and connects the parish with the I√±aquito urban parish of the city of Quito. In 2004, the Chaqui√±√°n rail trail from Cumbay√° to the parish of Puembo, 20 kilometres to the northeast was re-opened.

It is available for Linux, macOS, Microsoft Windows, AmigaOS 4 and OpenBSD as free and open-source software.  History  The game development started in 2000 under the name \\"Armagetron - Multiplayer Lightcycle Game\\" as free and open-source software released under version 2 of the GNU General Public License on Sourceforge.net.Armagetron - Multiplayer Lightcycle Game on sourceforge.net In March 2005 the project continued under the name \\"Armagetron Advanced\\", which is also hosted on sourceforge.net.armagetron advanced on sourceforge.net In 2007, \\"Armacycles Advanced\\" was chosen as an alternative secondary game name for the Fedora Linux operating system to avoid future potential trademark issues. For the same reason, \\"Retrocycles\\" was chosen as another secondary game name to use with the Steam distribution service in 2020. Gameplay Two or more players are represented by dual-wheeled motor vehicles, or light cycles, in a grid- lined arena. The vehicles constantly move forward, leaving a colored trail behind them as they travel. Contact with either the arena walls or a trail left by a player will result in death and elimination from the battle (not only does this remove their trail entirely, the explosion also breaches trails a short distance away). Therefore, players attempt to box each other in order to force their opponents to touch their trail or one of the arena walls. Players can change the direction of movement, by turning 90 degrees to the left or right (though in some servers the number of axes is more than four, making it possible to turn 45 degrees, or none at all). Being close to a colored trail causes the bike to accelerate; the closer the player is to the trail, the greater the acceleration. This allows players to accelerate and use the resulting speed advantage to outmaneuver their opponents. Players are able to use a brake, the 'v' key by default, to slow down, however, the effectiveness of the brake varies from server to server. Some servers even implement a 'speed brake', which turns the brake key into an accelerator. = Game modes = Several game modes exist: * Fast Track (FT): A free-for-all game mode with up to 8 players. High rubber, high speed, and very high enemy wall acceleration make for very intense gameplay. * Team Gauntlet: Two teams compete with each other on various generated maps. ** Wild Fortress: Objective is to conquer the opponents' zone. * Rotation: Two teams compete on various game modes. * Death Match: Last man standing. (One of the most common ways played) ** No Rubber (NR): Played with no or one rubber. Rubber is a mechanism that helps to account for lag. The more rubber, the greater leeway the server allows the player. Touching a wall will result in instant death, making this a fast-paced game mode where players need fast reflexes. ** Low Rubber (LR): Played with an average of five to ten rubber. ** Medium Rubber (MR): Played with an average of ten to fifteen rubber. ** High Rubber (HR): Played with an average of fifteen to thirty rubber. And a speed of about 20-40 ** Dog Fight (DF): Currently it is a mode that consists of slow to medium speed bikes and medium rubber (around 12). ** Loose / Open Play: Usually played with medium speed bikes or DF settings. On loose servers (any servers with \\"Loose Dogfight\\" in the name) there are rules for trapping the opponent that disallow completely grinding or sealing the tail of another player (known as stabbing/digging). This leaves an open path that an opponent can in theory maneuver through without having to \\"dig\\" underneath another player's grind. This is the only game mode in which the player is not 'allowed' to do certain things within the game, such as stabbing, although the server does not specifically restrict them. * Team Death Match: Cooperate with teammates. * Fortress: Capture the enemy base. This game can be played with teams or death match style. * Sumo: The object is to stay in a zone while trying to force the opponent out, forcing their zone to collapse and their cycle to explode. * Race: Race to the win zone at the end of the map. * Maze: Find a path to the win zone. * Sty Patch (formerly Pig Sty): ** Shooting: A team death match where the object is to try to shoot the other team's players with death zones. ** StyBall: A team match where the object is to score a goal by pushing the ball zone into the goal zone. (quite similar to football) ** Capture the Flag (CTF): Capture the opponents' flag. Players are respawned if they are dead and a player (ally or opponent) touches the base on the respective side. (This is a 2 team Game Mode) ** Capture The Flag Shooting (CTFS): Capture the opponents' flag while shooting. Players are respawned if they are dead and a player (ally or opponent) touches the base on the respective side. ** Flag Fortress (FF): A fortress game with fortress physics with the objective being to capture the opponents flag. Players are respawned if they are dead and a player (ally or opponent) touches the base with the respective color.

Biography Willi Heinrich was born in Heidelberg, Baden-W√ºrttemberg. During the Second World War he fought on the Eastern Front with the 1st Battalion 228th J√§ger Regiment of the 101st J√§ger Division. Over the course of the war, the 101st J√§ger Division suffered seven hundred percent casualties - Heinrich himself was wounded five times. After the war, Heinrich became a writer; his first novel In einem Schloss zu wohnen, written 1950‚Äì1952, went unpublished until 1976, when he was an established novelist. His first commercial novel, Das Geduldige Fleisch was published in 1955. The novel is set on the Eastern Front and centres around the conflicts within Heinrich's former unit. An immediate success, the novel was translated to English and published as The Willing Flesh (1956) by Weidenfeld & Nicolson in the U.K., and as Cross of Iron (1957) by Bobbs-Merrill in the U.S. In 1977, Sam Peckinpah adapted it as the film Cross of Iron, featuring James Coburn as the protagonist anti-hero Rolf Steiner. Though he began as a war genre novelist, Heinrich concentrated in the potboiler genre of soapy, sexy stories that were very popular in the 1970s and 1980s. Most of his books are novels, but Erz√§hlungen (1985) is an anthology comprising three novellas: Die Freundinnen, Fata Morgana, and Harte Bandagen. His last book, Der Gesang Der Sirenen (The Singing of the Sirens), was published in 1994. Willi Heinrich died in Dobel, near Karlsruhe, in 2005.
