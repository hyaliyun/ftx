The game dates at least to the 18th century, being first mentioned by the English authoress, Frances Burney, and probably derives from a more ancient drinking and gambling game.Oxford Dictionary of Card Games, David Parlett, p. 273; Oxford University Press (1996); References to \\"Snip, snap, snorum\\", which seems to be the original spelling, go back to at least 1823.Ferguson, James (1823). The British Essayists, Vol XXVI, Richardson, London. p. 267.  History  \\"Snip, snap, snorum\\" is recorded as early as 1767 in England in a way that suggests the game would have been well known and appears, as Chnif Chnof Chnorum, in 1782 and 1790 in France. Vilmar describes it as a children's game popular in the early 19th century in Germany, the original and proper name of which was Schnipp, Schnapp, Schnorum, Apostelorum although the last word, which means \\"of the apostles\\" became corrupted to the meaningless word, \\"Basalorum\\". Five villages in 19th-century Sweden were named after the Swedish equivalent, Snipp, snapp, snorum, hej basalorum: Snipp, Snapp, Snorum, Hej and Basalorum. Karl Fahlgren, Skellefte sockens historia (1953) Sid.80 - Tryckt på Almqvist & Wiksells boktryckeri AB The game There are several methods of playing the game, but in the most common a full Whist pack is used and any number of players may take part. The pack is dealt, one card at a time, and the eldest hand places upon the table any card of his choosing. Each player in his turn then tries to match the card played just before his; playing it while saying one of the prescribed words: \\"Snip!\\", \\"Snap!\\" or \\"Snorem!\\" in sequence. Thus, if a King is played, the next player lays down another King (if one is in-hand) calling out \\"Snip!\\". The next player may lay down the third King if available, saying \\"Snap!\\", and the next the fourth King with the word \\"Snorem!\\". A player not being able to pair the card played may not discard, and the holder of snorem has the privilege of beginning the next round. The player who gets rid of all cards in-hand first wins a counter from the other players for each card still held by them. Variations =Earl of Coventry= Earl of Coventry is just the same, but played without counters for a simple win. The leader says \\"There's as good a 6 can be\\" (if they had played a six). The second player says \\"There's a 6 as good as he\\", the third \\"There's the best of all the three\\", and the fourth \\"And there's the Earl of Coventry\\". Optionally, players may be required to make a different rhyming statement every time they play a fourth card.The Little Giant Book of Card Games, p. 122; Alfred Sheinwold, Sheila Anne Barry, Margie Golick-Sterling (2003); =Jig= A related game called Jig is somewhat a cross between Snip-Snap and Stops, in that the aim of succeeding players is not to match rank but to play the next higher card of the same suit, from Ace low to King high. The leader plays any card and says \\"Snip\\", and the next four able to continue the sequence announce respectively \\"Snap\\", \\"Snorum\\", \\"Hicockalorum\\", \\"Jig\\". The last turns down the five-card sequence and starts a new one. When a sequence cannot be continued because the last card was a King or the next card has been played out, the last player says \\"Jig\\" regardless of position, and leads to the next round. As before, the first out of cards receives 1 counter for each card left in other players' hands. Notes and Queries (1862) Notes and Queries = Schnipp-Schnapp-Schnurr-Burr-Basilorum = An extended version called Schnipp Schnapp Schnurr Burr Basilorum is played in Germany. Kings are not stops but are followed by Ace, Two, etc. The rules are recorded as early as 1868 in the Electorate of Hesse under their original name of Schnipp Schnapp Schnurr Apostolorum, the last word \\"also being abbreviated to Bostelorum or Bastelorum\\" and, later, Baselorum. In the variant described by Vilmar, players must lead either with a Seven or a Jack. He goes on to explains that the original meaning was to imply a game being played between the Four Apostles or Evangelists, but that its corruption to Baselorum by another author diminished its potential irreverence.

Education  Campbell was educated at Columbia College, graduating in 1891 and was posthumously inducted into the Athletics Hall of Fame in 2010. Career For over a century, Campbell had the honour of being the youngest male player to win the U.S. singles title. He did it as a 19-year, 6 months and 9 days old student in 1890. That record went to fellow American Pete Sampras, 19 years and 28 days, when he won the title in 1990. Campbell defended his title in the challenge round matches in 1891, defeating Clarence Hobart, and in 1892, defeating Fred Hovey, but did not defend it in 1893 and thereby defaulted the title to Robert Wrenn. The challenge round against Clarence Hobart was the first title match played over five sets. In addition to his singles titles Campbell won the men's doubles titles at the U.S. National Championships in 1888, 1891 and 1892. Campbell was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1955.

Nicknamed \\"Red Haired Devil\\", he ranks 21st among the 36 Heavenly Spirits, the first third of the 108 Stars of Destiny. Background A native of Dongluzhou (東潞州; believed to be present- day Changzhi, Shanxi), Liu Tang is muscular and dark-complexioned. He is nicknamed \\"Red Haired Devil\\" because his hair is of a crimson hue and his broad face bears a prominent red birthmark. A skilled fighter, he specialises in the use of pudao. With no fixed abode, he mainly does illegal trading in Shandong and Hebei. Robbing the convoy of birthday gifts Liu Tang gets wind of the conveyance of valuables to the Grand Tutor Cai Jing in the imperial capital Dongjing from Daming. They are birthday gift from Cai's son- in-law Grand Secretary Liang Shijie, the prefect of Daming. Liu rushes to Dongxi village in Yuncheng County to suggest to Chao Gai, the village's headman who is well-known for chivalry, that they together hijack the valuables. Before he reaches Chao's home, he gets drunk and falls asleep in a rundown temple in the village. Lei Heng, a chief constable of Yuncheng, comes to the temple that night while on patrol with his men. Lei is certain that Liu, with his odd and vagabond looks, is up to no good in the village. They pounce on him and tie him up before he could resist. They then stop by at Chao Gai's manor for some refreshment. Out of curiosity, Chao secretly goes to check on Liu, who is suspended in a side room. Liu tells Chao the purpose of his visit. Chao Gai then lies to Lei Heng that Liu Tang is his nephew, thus winning his release. However, feeling sore over the arrest, Liu catches up with Lei Heng as he returns to office and challenges him to a fight. Chao Gai comes to the scene and stops the clash. The hijack team eventually comprises seven men, namely Chai Gai, Wu Yong, Gongsun Sheng, Liu Tang and the three Ruan brothers. Disguised as date traders and with the help of Bai Sheng, who imposes as a wine seller, they trick the escort party led by Yang Zhi to take the drugged wine of Bai. When the escorts fall over numb in their limbs, the seven men cart away the valuables. But authorities soon track down essential clues and send soldiers to seize Chao Gai at his house. Song Jiang, a clerk of Yuncheng's magistrate, learns of the arrest order and rushes to alert Chao to flee. After beating their pursuers, Chao leads his gang to join the outlaw stronghold at Liangshan Marsh. Joining Liangshan Worried that Chao Gai would usurp his position, Wang Lun, the chief of Liangshan, tries to send the group away with gifts and excuses. Wu Yong instigates Lin Chong, who has been cold-shouldered by Wang since joining the stronghold, to kill the chief. Chao Gai is then elected the new chief of Liangshan, with Liu Tang taking the fifth position. Chao Gai sends Liu Tang to take some gold pieces and a letter to Song Jiang to convey his gratitude. Song is shocked when Liu, whose wanted notice bearing his picture is widely posted in the region, greets him openly one night on the street. Besides, Liu could be easily identified by the prominent birthmark on his face. Nevertheless, Song takes Liu to a quiet inn where he accepts only one piece of gold and the letter. It is this letter which later leads to Song killing his mistress Yan Poxi, who threatens to report his link to the outlaws to the authorities. The incident starts Song on the way to become a bandit. When the Liangshan outlaws attack Dongchang Prefecture (東昌府; in present-day Liaocheng, Shandong) for food, they come up against the garrison commander Zhang Qing, who flings stones with great accuracy. Zhang fells many Liangshan warriors from horseback with his stones. Liu Tang, seeing that mounted combat is getting nowhere, charges at Zhang on foot. But he is captured when Zhang knocks him down with a stone. He is freed after the outlaws overran Dongchang. Campaigns and death Liu Tang is appointed as one of the infantry leaders of Liangshan after the 108 Stars of Destiny came together in what is called the Grand Assembly. He participates in the campaigns against the Liao invaders and rebel forces in Song territory following amnesty from Emperor Huizong for Liangshan. In the battle of Hangzhou in the campaign against Fang La, Liu Tang meets his end when, eager to score merit, he charges into the city upon noticing the gate is open. A beam is dropped on him when he gets past the gate, crushing him to death. He is later awarded the posthumous title \\"Martial Gentleman of Loyalty\\" (忠武郎).

Its centerpiece is Traveler's Rest, an early tavern and inn. It was designated a National Historic Landmark on January 29, 1964, for its architecture as a well-preserved 19th-century tavern, and for its role in the early settlement by white men of northeastern Georgia.Blanche Higgins Schroer (1978) , National Park Service and Description and history Travelers Rest is about 6 miles (10 km) east of Toccoa, Georgia, near the Tugaloo River, on Riverdale Road just north of United States Route 123. It was built upon Cherokee land close to the former Cherokee town of Tugaloo granted to Major Jesse Walton in 1785. Walton, a Revolutionary War soldier and political leader, was killed by Indians near here in 1789. The Walton family sold the land to James Rutherford Wyly who built the main part of the house between 1816 and 1825. Wyly opened the house as an inn for travelers on the newly constructed Unicoi Turnpike. Devereaux Jarrett bought the house on August 21, 1838 and it became the headquarters of his plantation. Jarrett added to the original structure and opened it to the public. Due to the growing population and increased through traffic, the structure served as an inn, trading post, and post office. While the ten room house was open to the public it entertained many illustrious travelers. The Jarrett account books that doubled as hotel registers contain the name of the English scientist and author, George William Featherstonhaugh. The main building is a large and rambling two story wood frame structure, more than long. It is built out of wide pine planking and has six chimneys. One of the fireplaces has a mantle with drawers for storage of valuables. The front porch has seven rooms on each level with separate entrances, and an inside staircase providing access to the second floor. The rear of the house is where the innkeeper's family lived, with public rooms (dining room and parlor areas) in between. The post office was located on the second floor. The property includes, in addition to the main building, recreations of typical outbuildings of the 19th century, including slave quarters. It remained in the hands of Jarrett's descendants until 1955, when it was acquired by the state. Today, visitors can tour the house and see many original artifacts and furnishings, some of which were crafted by Caleb Shaw, a renowned cabinetmaker from Massachusetts.

Ampusongan (currently a barangay of Bakun) was a rancheria of the Commandancia Politico Militar de Tiagan, Distrito de Benguet. When the United States took control of the Philippines, the American Congress issued Act No. 48 in November 1900, placing Bakun under the province of Amburayan, and Ampusongan under the province of Benguet. On August 13, 1908, Benguet became a subprovince of the newly established Mountain Province with the enactment of Act No. 1876, and the municipal districts of Bakun and Ampusongan became part of the subprovince. In 1917, the Bureau of Non-Christian Tribes recommended that the western border of the Mountain Province be pushed eastward, such that the entire subprovince of Amburayan and large slices of Lepanto and Benguet would be made part of Ilocos Sur and La Union. In early 1937, Ampusongan was merged with Bakun, the latter carrying the name of the township while the former became a barangay. The issuance of Republic Act No. 4695 in 1966 included Bakun as a regular municipality in the newly created province of Benguet. Geography Bakun is located at , at the northwestern tip of Benguet.

According to the , it has a population of people. The municipality is home to the mummy of Apo Anno, one of the most revered and important folk hero in Benguet prior to Spanish arrival. Etymology According to folklore, Buguias got its name from the word bugas (or begas) which means \\"rice\\". Another version of its origin would be an Igorot settlement during the pre-Spanish time called Bogey-yas, which was modernized and spelled as Buguias by Spanish authorities. History =Pre-colonial era= Nabalicong village in Barangay Natubleng was the center of the area's cultural and political domains prior to Spanish colonization. In the 12th century,http://www.benguet.gov.ph/index.php/tourism/what-to- see/t-cultural a folk hero, known as Apo Anno, lived with the people of the area and was a spiritual leader, hunter, and demigod. The people believed Apo Anno was a son of a Benguet goddess. His body was filled with tattoos, symbolizing his high status in the community. During his protectorate of the domain, prosperity spurred. He died before the arrival of the Spaniards, and thus, was given mummification and death rites in the traditional way.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQDjoNX_Tkw =Spanish period= The arrival of Spanish colonizers in Buguias were primarily due to the construction of Spanish trails leading to the mountain region. Buguias and Loo were two separate rancherias during the Spanish Regime. =American period= During the American rule, Buguias was established as one of the 19 townships of the province of Benguet, upon the issuance of Act No. 48 by the Philippine Commission on November 22, 1900. On November 23, 1900, the township of Loo was abolished and integrated into the township of Buguias with the issuance of Act No. 49. On August 13, 1908, Benguet was established as a sub-province of the newly created Mountain Province with the enactment of Act No. 1876. As a result, six townships of Benguet were abolished, but Buguias remained a constituent town of Benguet sub-province. In 1918, the mummy of Apo Anno was stolen by foreign treasure hunters. An earthquake and pestilence followed afterwards, prompting the people to campaign for the return of Apo Anno to his resting place. =Post-war era= On June 25, 1963, President Diosdado Macapagal issued Executive Order No. 42 converting eight (8) of the thirteen (13) towns (designated as municipal districts) of Benguet sub-province into regular municipalities. Buguias was among them. On June 18, 1966, the sub- province of Benguet was separated from the old Mountain Province and was converted into a regular province. Buguias remained to be a component municipality of the newly established province. =Contemporary era= In 1984, a Filipino antique collector bought an auctioned mummy, only to discover it was the mummy of Apo Anno. He donated it to the National Museum of the Philippines afterwards for better care of the national treasure. The people of Buguias made diplomatic channels with the National Museum until it was agreed that the National Museum would return the mummy of Apo Anno to its resting place in barangay Nabalicong after Benguet officials agreed to install iron grills in the burial cave and provide funds for its upkeep. Later that year, Apo Anno was returned to its burial cave, through elaborate death rituals last performed in the 16th century and a hero's homecoming conducted by the people of Buguias. There have been scholars campaigning for the declaration of Apo Anno's mummy and resting place as a collective National Treasure or Important Cultural Property of the Philippines.

The third highest mountain in the Philippines, Mount Pulag, is located in the territorial boundary of the vegetable farming town. Etymology The name Kabayan was derived from the term Kaba-ayan, from the Ibaloi word ba-ay, a root crop vine thriving in the place. Most of the early Ibaloi settlements, in the area, which include Eddet and Duacan, were named after grasses in the heavily- forested area. History =Pre-colonial period= The first Ibaloi settlers in Benguet arrived at Imbose (or Embosi), located in present-day Kabayan.

According to the , it has a population of people. The municipality is known as a mining town, being the location of several mines, including the Lepanto Consolidated Mining Company. Etymology The name \\"Mankayan\\" is derived from Nancayan, the Hispanic term of the native name of the place, Nangkayang (which means \\"high up in the mountain\\"). History =Pre-colonial period= Nangkayang was once a heavily-forested area. The natives of the surrounding settlements of Panat and Bag-ongan mined gold through the labon system, after its reported discovery in a river. Copper was later discovered by the end of the 16th century in Kamangga-an (location of present-day Lepanto). =Spanish period= By the 1800s, the Spanish colonial government sent expeditions to survey the mines. On February 3, 1850, an expedition led by engineer Don Antonio Hernandez confirmed the presence of copper in Mankayan. In 1852, Lepanto was established by the Spanish as a comandancia politico-militar, composed of several rancherias which included Mankayan. Seven different mines were discovered in the Mankayan-Suyoc region during Admiral Pedro Durán de Monforte's 1667 expedition, and Simón de Anda's administration (1770-1776) mentioned Igorot copperware. In 1833, Galvey sent ore samples from Gambang (\\"copper\\"), Suyoc, and Mankayan, to the governor. The first Spanish mining claim on the Cordillera was made by Tomás Balbas y Castro on 26 March 1856, and established a mining company called the Sociedad Minero-Metalurgica Cantabro Filipino de Mancayan. The company ceased operations in 1875. =American period= Under the American rule, Mankayan remained under the jurisdiction of Lepanto, and later Lepanto-Bontoc until the latter's dissolution. Mankayan was later annexed to the sub-province of Benguet as a municipal district in 1913. The mining boom in Mankayan began in 1933, with American Victor Lednickey establishing the Lepanto Consolidated Mining Company on September 26, 1936. =Second World War= In 1942, following the outbreak of the war, the Lepanto Consolidated Mining Company, together with the Suyoc Consolidated Mining Company, were taken over by the Japanese Mitsui Mining Company, which renamed the mines into \\"Mitsui Mankayan Copper Mines\\". The Mitsui Company controlled the mines until 1945. =Post-war era= After the war, the Lepanto Consolidated Mining Company resumed the mining operations. Mankayan was converted from a municipal district into a regular municipality on June 16, 1955, by virtue of Republic Act 1302. In 2018, in order to preserve the highly artistic gangsa-making intangible heritage of the Mankayan elders, the cultural masters of the town converged and began teaching the younger generations the process and importance of gangsa-making to their way of life, effectively preserving indigenous gong culture in the town.http://pia.gov.ph/news/articles/1004356 Geography Mankayan is on the north-western tip of Benguet.

However, after his death, he serves as a spiritual guardian of the outlaws, who from time to time dedicate ceremonial sacrifices to him. Background Chao Gai earned his nickname \\"Pagoda-Shifting Heavenly King\\" after carrying a pagoda miniature from the west side of a creek to the east, where his village stood, to deter malevolent spirits. His fellows commonly refer to him as \\"Heavenly King Chao\\" (). Born in a wealthy family, he serves as the baozheng (保正; a chief of a village with 500 households) of Dongxi Village (東溪村; \\"Eastern Creek Village\\") in Yuncheng County, Shandong. Apart from having a wide network of friends and acquaintances throughout the jianghu, he also maintains close friendships with the local chief constables Zhu Tong and Lei Heng. Robbing the convoy of birthday gifts When Chao Gai's friend Liu Tang receives news that a convoy escorting some birthday gifts for the Imperial Tutor Cai Jing will be passing by Dongxi Village, he wants to rob the convoy and plans to get Chao Gai to help him. During his journey to Dongxi Village, he gets drunk and falls asleep in a rundown temple. Lei Heng, who passes by the temple, suspects that Liu Tang is a fugitive so he arrests him. Along the way back to the county office, Lei Heng decides to visit Chao Gai and take a break at Dongxi Village. While Lei Heng is enjoying the village's hospitality, Chao Gai surreptitiously meets Liu Tang and finds out what happened. He then lies to Lei Heng that Liu Tang is a distant relative and gets Lei Heng to release Liu Tang. Chao Gai forms a team of seven to rob the convoy. They disguise themselves as date traders and, with Bai Sheng's help, trick the escorts into consuming wine spiked with drugs that will make them unconscious. Once the unsuspecting escorts are knocked out, Chao Gai and his friends escape with the birthday gifts. After the incident, the authorities order the constable He Tao to track down and arrest the robbers. Bai Sheng carelessly reveals his role in the robbery and ends up being arrested. Despite being tortured, Bai Sheng refuses to name his accomplices even though He Tao already knows that Chao Gai is one of them. Joining Liangshan Song Jiang secretly warns Chao Gai and his friends that they are wanted by the authorities, and advises them to flee immediately. In the meantime, the local magistrate assigns Zhu Tong and Lei Heng to lead soldiers to arrest Chao Gai and his friends. However, after considering their friendship with Chao Gai, the two chief constables secretly help him and his friends escape. After defeating the soldiers sent to arrest them, Chao Gai and his friends retreat to Liangshan Marsh and join the outlaw band there. Wang Lun, the outlaw chief, feels that Chao Gai and his friends pose a threat to him so he tries to send them away with gifts and excuses. During this time, Wu Yong instigates Lin Chong, who is already unhappy with Wang Lun, to kill Wang Lun. Chao Gai then becomes the new chief of the Liangshan outlaw band. Throughout his tenure as Liangshan's chief, Chao Gai hardly participates in battles against Liangshan's enemies. For the most part, he lets Song Jiang lead Liangshan forces into battle while he remains behind to guard their base and provide reinforcements. Death and legacy On one occasion, the Zeng brothers of the Zeng Family Fortress rob a precious steed from Duan Jingzhu, who originally intended to present it as a gift to Chao Gai. The Zengs have all along been hostile towards Liangshan and have put up slogans around their fortress to insult Liangshan's leaders. After the Zengs ambushed and injured Liu Tang for no apparent reason, Chao Gai can no longer stand their provocations and decides to personally lead Liangshan forces to attack the fortress and teach the Zengs a lesson. During a battle against the Zeng forces, Chao Gai gets hit in the forehead by an arrow coated with poison. The arrow was fired by Shi Wengong, the martial arts instructor in the fortress. Chao Gai dies of poisoning shortly afterwards. Before his death, he says: \\"Whoever captures Shi Wengong and avenges me shall become the next chief of Liangshan\\". Although Lu Junyi turns out to be the one who defeats and captures Shi Wengong, Song Jiang ultimately succeeds Chao Gai as Liangshan's chief when Lu Junyi and the other outlaw chieftains insist that Song Jiang be their leader. Chao Gai's character is entirely consistent with the ideas presented in the Liangshan outlaws' manifesto: \\"delivering justice on Heaven's behalf\\". His personal history as an official-turned-outlaw also portends the Liangshan way of life and their subsequent methods of recruiting members who previously served in the government.

Anton Heinrich Springer (13 July 182531 May 1891) was a German art historian and writer. Early life Springer was born in Prague, where he studied philosophy and history at Charles University, earning a Ph.D.. Taking an interest in art, he made several educational journeys, travelling to Munich, Dresden and Berlin, and spent some months in Italy. After his Ph.D. he addressed himself to art history. He wrote a second Ph.D. thesis on Hegel's theory of history in Tübingen, where he also was involved in the political activities of the Revolution of 1848. Work He settled at Tübingen, but in 1848 returned to Prague and began to lecture at the university on the history of the revolutionary epoch. The liberal tone of these lectures brought him into disfavour with the ruling authorities, and in 1849 he left Bohemia and passed some time in England, France and the Netherlands. In 1852 he settled at Bonn, where he was lecturer and professor (from 1860) for art history. In 1872 he went to the University of Strasbourg, and in 1873 to Leipzig University, where he became Professor for Medieval and Modern Art at the newly founded Institute for Art History. As a journalist and a publicist Springer advocated the federal union of the states ruled by the Austrian emperor, and asserted the right of Prussia to the headship of Germany; during the Crimean War he favored the emancipation of the small states in southeast Europe from Turkish supremacy. After many years of feeble health, he died at Leipzig on 31 May 1891. A fiery personality, he disparaged the art historian Herman Grimm, whom, according to Kessler, he attacked from the lectern as a writer of dime novels for wealthy readers. Likewise he berated the art historian Hermann Knackfuß as \\"Hermann Knackwurst.\\" Jacob Burckhardt, fully cognizant of Springer's enmity toward him, reportedly gave Springer's student Gustav Pauli a rough reception when Pauli applied to study under him in Basel. Springer played an important role in establishing art history as an academic subject. He rejected the more literary or impressionistic approaches of his colleagues like Herman Grimm or Hermann Knackfuß. Among his own works are several treatises on occidental art: a Compendium on the Architecture of the Christian Middle Ages (1854), a Handbook on Art History (1855), a History of Fine Arts in the 19th Century (1858), Iconographical Studies (1860), a work on Contemporary Fine Arts (1875), books on Raphael and Michelangelo (1878) and (posthumously) a book on Albrecht Dürer (1892). Bibliography His historical works include his Geschichte Österreichs seit dem Wiener Frieden (Leipzig, 1863–1865), which was translated into Czech (Prague, 1867), as well as: Geschichte des Revolutionszeitalters (Prague, 1849); Österreich nach der Revolution (Prague, 1850); Österreich, Preussen und Deutschland (Prague, 1851); Paris im 18. Jahrhundert (Leipzig, 1856); and Protokolle des Verfassungs-Ausschusses im Oesterreichischen Reichstage 1848–1849 (Leipzig, 1885). His principal works on art are: Leitfaden der Baukunst des christlichen Mittelalters (Bonn, 1854); the valuable Handbuch der Kunstgeschichte (7th ed., Leipzig, 1906), a revised edition of his Grundzüge der Kunstgeschichte (Leipzig, 1887–1888); Geschichte der bildenden Künste im 14. Jahrhundert (Leipzig, 1858); Bilder aus der neueren Kunstgeschichte (Bonn 1867, and again 1886); Raffael und Michelangelo (Leipzig, 1877 and 1885); and Die Kunst des 14. Jahrhunderts (Leipzig 1880–1881). Springer wrote two biographies: Friedrich Christoph Dahlmann (Leipzig, 1870–1872), and Albrecht Dürer (Berlin, 1892); and was responsible for the German edition of Crowe and Cavalcaselle's Lives of the Early Flemish Painters, which was published at Leipzig in 1875. His book of reminiscences, Aus meinem Leben (Berlin, 1892), containing contributions by Gustav Freytag and Hubert Janitschek, was edited by his son Jaro Springer (born 1856), who is also known as a writer on art.

History =Formation= Jacqueline and Marc Mero separated on the November 22 episode of Sunday Night Heat, and the jilted Jacqueline formed a new stable of women known as the Pretty Mean Sisters (a pun on \\"PMS\\") with Terri Runnels, who was separated from her husband, Goldust. During a match between Mero and Goldust on the November 23 episode of Raw, Jacqueline and Terri entered the ring and low-blowed both men. Vince Russo was the creator of the storyline, which Terri Runnels originally fought him about doing. =Rivalries= Terri also claimed to be pregnant with new boyfriend, Val Venis's baby, but when he found out about the news, he dumped her. They later formed an alliance with D'Lo Brown and Mark Henry, accompanying them to the ring for a match against Venis and The Godfather in December at Rock Bottom: In Your House. In January, Terri claimed to have suffered a miscarriage after she was knocked off of the ring apron by Brown. The guilty Brown became a servant to PMS, who forced him to wrestle his friend, Mark Henry. The deception lasted until February 1, when the ringside doctor told Brown that Terri had not been pregnant. PMS then feuded with Brown by costing him matches and attacking his new manager, Ivory. Jacqueline returned to the women's division in March, and on the April 12 episode of Raw Is War, she, Ivory, Tori, and Sable took part in a four way match for the Women's Championship. The match was declared a no-contest after Sable's bodyguard Nicole Bass stormed the ring and chokeslammed the three challengers. =Addition of Meat= PMS gained a \\"love slave\\" named Meat (Shawn Stasiak), because he was \\"nothing more than a piece of meat\\", in May. In the same month, the stable expanded once more to incorporate Ryan Shamrock, who had been spurned by the womanizing Val Venis, but she left both the stable and the WWF in the following months. As a part of the storyline, the three women used Meat for his body, forcing him to have sex with them. Also, they would force him to do their bidding and wear wrestling tights that resembled a pair of tight underwear. After Shamrock left the WWF, Terri and Jacqueline continued to assist Meat in his matches. Tension began to grow between the two women as Terri, in storyline, exhausted Meat with hours of sex before his matches and then berated her fatigued lover when he lacked the energy to win matches. Jacqueline left the stable after Terri forced Meat to kiss her feet on the August 1 episode of Sunday Night Heat.

In physics, a perfect fluid is a fluid that can be completely characterized by its rest frame mass density \\\\rho_m and isotropic pressure p. Real fluids are \\"sticky\\" and contain (and conduct) heat. Perfect fluids are idealized models in which these possibilities are neglected. Specifically, perfect fluids have no shear stresses, viscosity, or heat conduction. In space-positive metric signature tensor notation, the stress–energy tensor of a perfect fluid can be written in the form :T^{\\\\mu u} = \\\\left( \\\\rho_m + \\\\frac{p}{c^2} \\\\right) \\\\, U^\\\\mu U^ u + p \\\\, \\\\eta^{\\\\mu u}\\\\, where U is the 4-velocity vector field of the fluid and where \\\\eta_{\\\\mu u} = \\\\operatorname{diag}(-1,1,1,1) is the metric tensor of Minkowski spacetime. In time-positive metric signature tensor notation, the stress–energy tensor of a perfect fluid can be written in the form :T^{\\\\mu u} = \\\\left( \\\\rho_\\\\text{m} + \\\\frac{p}{c^2} \\\\right) \\\\, U^\\\\mu U^ u - p \\\\, \\\\eta^{\\\\mu u}\\\\, where U is the 4-velocity of the fluid and where \\\\eta_{\\\\mu u} = \\\\operatorname{diag}(1,-1,-1,-1) is the metric tensor of Minkowski spacetime. This takes on a particularly simple form in the rest frame : \\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\rho_e &0&0&0\\\\\\\\\\\\0&p;&0&0\\\\\\\\\\\\0&0&p;&0\\\\\\\\\\\\0&0&0&p;\\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] where \\\\rho_\\\\text{e} = \\\\rho_\\\\text{m} c^2 is the energy density and p is the pressure of the fluid. Perfect fluids admit a Lagrangian formulation, which allows the techniques used in field theory, in particular, quantization, to be applied to fluids. This formulation can be generalized, but unfortunately, heat conduction and anisotropic stresses cannot be treated in these generalized formulations. Perfect fluids are used in general relativity to model idealized distributions of matter, such as the interior of a star or an isotropic universe. In the latter case, the equation of state of the perfect fluid may be used in Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker equations to describe the evolution of the universe. In general relativity, the expression for the stress–energy tensor of a perfect fluid is written as :T^{\\\\mu u} = \\\\left( \\\\rho_m + \\\\frac{p}{c^2} \\\\right) \\\\, U^\\\\mu U^ u + p \\\\, g^{\\\\mu u}\\\\, where U is the 4-velocity vector field of the fluid and where g_{\\\\mu u} is the metric, written with a space-positive signature.

In other words, if \\\\leq is a prewellordering on a set X, and if we define \\\\sim by :x\\\\sim y\\\\iff x\\\\leq y \\\\land y\\\\leq x then \\\\sim is an equivalence relation on X, and \\\\leq induces a wellordering on the quotient X/\\\\sim. The order-type of this induced wellordering is an ordinal, referred to as the length of the prewellordering. A norm on a set X is a map from X into the ordinals. Every norm induces a prewellordering; if \\\\phi:X\\\\to Ord is a norm, the associated prewellordering is given by :x\\\\leq y\\\\iff\\\\phi(x)\\\\leq\\\\phi(y) Conversely, every prewellordering is induced by a unique regular norm (a norm \\\\phi:X\\\\to Ord is regular if, for any x\\\\in X and any \\\\alpha<\\\\phi(x), there is y\\\\in X such that \\\\phi(y)=\\\\alpha).  Prewellordering property  If \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Gamma} is a pointclass of subsets of some collection \\\\mathcal{F} of Polish spaces, \\\\mathcal{F} closed under Cartesian product, and if \\\\leq is a prewellordering of some subset P of some element X of \\\\mathcal{F}, then \\\\leq is said to be a \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Gamma}-prewellordering of P if the relations <^* and \\\\leq^* are elements of \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Gamma}, where for x,y\\\\in X, # x<^*y\\\\iff x\\\\in P\\\\land[y otin P\\\\lor\\\\\\\\{x\\\\leq y\\\\land y ot\\\\leq x\\\\\\\\}] # x\\\\leq^* y\\\\iff x\\\\in P\\\\land[y otin P\\\\lor x\\\\leq y] \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Gamma} is said to have the prewellordering property if every set in \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Gamma} admits a \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Gamma}-prewellordering. The prewellordering property is related to the stronger scale property; in practice, many pointclasses having the prewellordering property also have the scale property, which allows drawing stronger conclusions. =Examples= \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Pi}^1_1 and \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Sigma}^1_2 both have the prewellordering property; this is provable in ZFC alone. Assuming sufficient large cardinals, for every n\\\\in\\\\omega, \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Pi}^1_{2n+1} and \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Sigma}^1_{2n+2} have the prewellordering property. =Consequences= Reduction If \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Gamma} is an adequate pointclass with the prewellordering property, then it also has the reduction property: For any space X\\\\in\\\\mathcal{F} and any sets A,B\\\\subseteq X, A and B both in \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Gamma}, the union A\\\\cup B may be partitioned into sets A^*,B^*, both in \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Gamma}, such that A^*\\\\subseteq A and B^*\\\\subseteq B. Separation If \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Gamma} is an adequate pointclass whose dual pointclass has the prewellordering property, then \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Gamma} has the separation property: For any space X\\\\in\\\\mathcal{F} and any sets A,B\\\\subseteq X, A and B disjoint sets both in \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Gamma}, there is a set C\\\\subseteq X such that both C and its complement X\\\\setminus C are in \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Gamma}, with A\\\\subseteq C and B\\\\cap C=\\\\emptyset.

He was United States Commissioner of Pensions under presidents James A. Garfield and Chester A. Arthur, and was Treasurer of the Republican National Committee. He was wounded and lost his leg at Gettysburg. Background William Wade Dudley was born in Weathersfield Bow, Vermont, the son of Reverend John Dudley, a well-known Congregational minister whose sermons were widely reprinted. Reverend Wade was a graduate of Yale Seminary, a sometime missionary to the Choctaw Indians, and a descendant of William Dudley, one of the earliest settlers of Guilford, Connecticut, in 1639.Dudley Farm, owned by the Dudley family for 350 years, North Guilford, Ct. Dudley's mother was Abigail Wade, a granddaughter of Col. Nathaniel Wade, a staff officer to General George Washington during the Revolutionary War. He married his first wife, Theresa Fiske, in 1864, and they had four children together. After his wife's death in 1897, he married Nannie A. Robinson. Dudley died in Washington, D.C., in 1909. Civil War After studying at Phillips Academy, Danville, in Vermont, and at Russell Military Academy in New Haven, Connecticut, he joined the Union Army as captain of the Richmond City Greys--volunteers for service in the American Civil War. Dudley's company was incorporated into the 19th Indiana Volunteer Regiment of the famed Iron Brigade of the Army of the Potomac. At age 19, at the Battle of Antietam, he took command of the regiment after the death of Lieutenant Colonel Alois O. Bachman. Following the battle, Dudley was quickly promoted to Major (September 18, 1862), and then Lieutenant Colonel (October 6, 1862). After losing 79 percent of his men at the Battle of Gettysburg, and having his right leg amputated on the field, he served as an army inspector and judge advocate and captain in the Veteran Reserve Corps. For gallantry in battle, he was awarded an honorary brevet to Brigadier General of Volunteers on March 13, 1865. Postbellum years Following the end of the war he became a civilian lawyer in 1870, then the U.S. marshal for Indiana in 1879, commissioner of pensions under appointment of Presidents James Garfield and Chester A. Arthur in 1881. In 1888 he was appointed Treasurer of the Republican National Committee. He returned to practicing law in 1887. 1888 election controversy In 1888 having been made Treasurer of the Republican National Committee, Dudley was involved in the 1888 elections and one of the most intense political campaigns in decades, with Indiana dead even between the Democratic incumbent President, Grover Cleveland, and the Republican challenger, Benjamin Harrison. Although this job did not strictly involve him in state politics, Dudley wrote a circular letter to Indiana's county chairmen, telling them to \\"Divide the floaters into blocs of five, and put a trusted man with the necessary funds in charge of these five, and make them responsible that none get away and that all vote our ticket,\\" and promising adequate funding for this. Unfortunately for the Republicans, the Democrats managed to get hold of the letter and they distributed hundreds of thousands of copies in the last days of the campaign. Given Dudley's unsavory reputation, few people believed his denials. The attack on \\"blocs of five\\" with the suggestion that pious General Benjamin Harrison was trying to buy the election enlivened the Democratic campaign and stimulated the nationwide movement to replace ballots printed and distributed by the parties with the secret \\"Australian ballot\\". Benjamin Harrison's electoral votes topped Cleveland's to win the election.

In response, the Extermination Act is enacted, a law that allows anyone who carries a gun to use lethal force in \\"alien-related\\" situation. Eventually, the law is extended to allow the killings of humans as well, allowing for the creation of licensed Exterminators.

According to the , it has a population of people. History The town was once a Barangay of the capital town, Malaybalay. It was named after a Banglas tree, endemic tree species that inhabit and growing abundantly and distinctively only on this portion of the upper Pulangui. Banglas is hardwood that usually grows in the rocky portion of the Bobunawan riverbanks. Kabanglasan literally means a place that has plenty of Banglas. Cabanglasan was created as a separate municipality from Malaybalay on August 13, 1979 by virtue of Republic Act 6489. The movement for the separation of Cabanglasan from his mother municipality (Malaybalay) began in the early 1960s when the people of Pulangi region petitioned for the secession. This prompted the passage of House Bill No. 2789 in Congress by the then Congressman Cesar M. Fortich. The bill was enacted into law without executive approval under Republic Act 6489 but its implementation was delayed due to the declaration of martial law. Due to the persistence of the residents as spearheaded by Datu Maliwanag (Saturnino P. Linsagan), then President Ferdinand E. Marcos referred the matter to the mother municipality, Malaybalay. A plebiscite was then held wherein the majority voted for the implementation of RA 6489. On August 13, 1979, the first set of municipal officials headed by Mayor Saturnino P. Linsagan aka Datu Maliwanag to his tribesmen, took their oath and held their first session. Geography Cabanglasan is geographically located between east longitude 125 degrees 27 minutes and north latitude 8 degrees and 3 minutes. It is located at the eastern part of the province of Bukidnon, bounded in the north and west by the City of Malaybalay and the south by the Municipality of San Fernando, and in the east by the province of Agusan del Sur. It has a total area of , of which 38% is Alienable and Disposable (A&D;) land and 62% is timberland. It has 15 barangays, 5 of which are situated within timberland namely; Freedom, Mandahican, Mauswagon, Jasaan, and Cananga- an. Five barangays, namely; Anlugan, Cabanglasan proper, Iba, Mandaing and Dalacutan are located within A&D; land while the remaining 5 barangays such as; Cabulohan, Capinonan, Imbatug, Paradise and Mauswagon are located within both timberland and A&D.; It occupies 2.52% of the total provincial area of Bukidnon and 0.74% of the regional area (Northern Mindanao). =Slope= The major part of the municipality is classified under slope class 8 to 15 percent. Where such areas are found, it is contiguous to level areas, identified as water retaining areas potentially suited to intensive palay production. Along its North, East and South boundaries is slope class 30% and above, hilly and mountainous are declared as forestal, but not necessarily foliaged. Cabanglasan has an average elevation of 465 meters above sea level. =Climate= Cabanglasan fall under the fourth type. It means that rainfall is more or less evenly distributed throughout the year. May to December is usually the period with long rainfalls. While driest months last from January to April. Mountain climates reasonably form another type of climate. As far as some climatological elements are concerned, except as to temperature, rainfall generally increases with height. =Barangays= Cabanglasan is politically subdivided into 15 barangays. Demographics In the , the population of Cabanglasan was people, with a density of . Cabanglasan was created to become a municipality on August 13, 1979 by virtue of Republic Act 6489. On the following year, 1980, a regular census on population and housing was conducted nationwide, wherein Cabanglasan had an actual population count of 16,843. In 1990, there was another census of population and housing. Because of the presence of the two logging companies, the T.H. Valderrama and Talakag Timber Incorporated, the population of this town grew to 26,351, an increase of about 9,508 or 56.45%. During those Censal years Barangays Cabulohan, Capinonan and Imbatug had a greater number of population because it was where the logging companies established their plant and housing camps. In 1995, a mid-decade census on population and housing was made. During that year, Cabanglasan had a population of 29,288 or an increase of 11.15%. However, due to the closure of the two logging companies in 1991, the population of the three barangays mentioned above decreased while the population of other barangays increased. Barangay Poblacion had an increase of 68.2116%. In 1990, its population was only 2,287 but it grew to 3,847 in 1995. This increase was due to the influx of former workers from the logging companies who settled in the neighboring barangays. As a result, the overall population count of the municipality increased at an average growth rate of 2.50%. Another factor of this population increase is the ongoing progress and development of this municipality, such as road accessibility to the different barangays and sitios, farm modernization, electrification and the coming of small and medium investors to establish their business in the Poblacion. With this positive trend we it can be projected that the increase of population will continue and the coming of investors would provide job opportunities to our people. Infrastructure =Transportation= Being typically landlocked, the means of transportation for intra-municipal travel is through jeepneys and motorcycles, buses and jeepneys can be availed of for travels going out of the municipality. Most of the vehicles (82%) are privately owned. About 16 percent are public utility vehicles while only 2% belonged to the government. The whole stretch of the national highway (21.61 km) is still gravel-paved. Of the 15.065 km municipal road, 4% percent has already been converted to concrete pavement, 9% is gravel-paved, and the rest is still earth-paved. The aggregate length of barangay roads in the municipality has been recorded at 287.409 km. Nearly 41 percent (117.603) of this is gravel-paved, a little over half (56%) of the total length is still unpaved while only less than one percent (1%) has been concreted. It can also be noted that earth-paved roads – especially roads going to the interior sitios are not passable during rainy season. Bridges link gaps between rivers. For areas which are not regular routes of land transportation but are bounded by rivers, hanging footbridges were constructed. =Communication= Postal services of the municipality is being provided by the Bureau of Post which is manned by a Postmaster. Being undermanned the postmaster also served as the municipality’s letter carrier. For telecommunication, the provincial government had installed a single side band radio at the municipality. This is actually part of the Provincial Radio Communication Network. Through this system the municipality is able to reach out to other parts of the province directly or via relay stations. This is being complemented by handheld radios in some barangays which the municipality used for transmitting messages to these areas. Cabanglasan’s populace is also kept abreast of recent information which is of regional and/or national significance through two Television channels which signal covered the municipality. These are the ABS-CBN (Channel 2) and GMA (Channel 12). AM and FM Band radio Stations from Malaybalay, Valencia, Cagayan and Davao also reached the municipality. Print media on the other hand only include a local newspaper (Bukidnon Newswatch) which has a weekly circulation. =Water systems= Springs, rivers and deep wells are the sources of water supply used for both domestic water supply and irrigation needs. Deep wells and springs are commonly used as potable water supply. Local government, congressional initiative, regional and senatorial funds are used to develop these sources. The municipal government’s ardent thrust to provide basic services to its constituents can be well manifested by its current pursuit to develop a level III type of water system through funding from the World Bank. The municipal government had entered into a loan agreement with the bank to develop a system that will provide for an individual pipe connection for each household within the barangays of Poblacion and Iba. Data shows that Level I and Level II type of systems are the most prevalent type of water supply in the municipality. Level I water system is currently serving 7.17% of the total households. Likewise, Level II is providing water for 47.39% of all households, while Level III only served 3.62% of the total. The rest (41.82%) still remained un- served by a water supply system =Health services= The health service in the Municipality of Cabanglasan is catered by the Municipal Health Office (MHO) and one private lying-in clinic. The former handles the public health services and some clinical services while the latter serves most of the clinical cases. The MHO is located at Poblacion and the nine Barangay Health Stations are located in the different barangays. These serve as channels in providing basic health services to the general populace. The office is manned by one Medical Doctor, one Dentist, one DOH-Nurse, four permanent Rural Health Midwives (RHMs), five Job Order RHMs, one Rural Sanitary Inspector (RSI) and one Dental Aid. The health personnel is augmented by 175 Barangay Health Workers (BHW) 38 “hilots” and other health oriented NGOs such as BIDANI, MAP, and the German Rolling Clinic. Health statistics showed that the four leading causes of morbidity fall under communicable diseases which are preventable in nature but there was a gradual increase of such cases in the past few years. This increase could be attributed to the lack of permanent personnel assigned in far-flung and strategically located barangays. Another contributing factor is the inadequate supply of medicines and medical logistics which are necessary in the implementation of health services and programs. Records from the nutrition program of the municipality revealed the high prevalence rate of malnutrition has gradually decreased. This accomplishment was due to the full support of the Local Government Unit and Department of Health, and the increased awareness of the general populace on proper nutrition. =Security= The total population is 29,288 as of 1995 having a ratio of one policeman per 1,220 inhabitants. The national standard ratio is one policeman per one thousand inhabitants. Therefore, Cabanglasan police force needs 15 Policemen to meet the standard ratio. Special Force (SF) of the Philippine Army (PA) established four strategic detachment, located at Barangay Poblacion, Freedom, Cananga-an and Jasaan. Each detachment is manned by two regular elements of the SF-PA assisted by their respective CAFGUs (Citizen Armed Forces Geographical Units). Cabanglasan police force is headed by one Police Commission Officer (PCO) as Chief of Police (COP), twenty three Police Non-Commission Officer (PCNO’s) with five police community precinct. Each PCP headed by one policeman assisted by their respective Bantay Bayan/CVOs (Civilian Volunteers Organization). The area of responsibility or coverage has one PCP for every three Barangays. Education =Elementary= The data on existing schools and facilities are complete which are indicative of the overall picture of the District of Cabanglasan. There are 26 elementary schools within the municipality three schools are within the urban center, while the remaining 23 schools are distributed throughout the rural areas. Each barangay has at least one elementary school with Iba and Poblacion having the biggest area in terms of hectares. All schools have playgrounds, some have clinics but none of them has a laboratory, shop or library. =Secondary= The Municipality of Cabanglasan has two secondary schools, one is a public school and one is a private secondary school, namely: Cabulohan-Paradise Nationalized Agricultural High School and Fr. Leoni Memorial School. A comparative analysis of enrolment showed that the public school has the highest enrolment with a total of 915 students for the current year, while on the private school has maintained its enrolment for the last five years with 587 students.

According to the , it has a population of people. History Historically, the first settlers of Damulog were the Manobos. They are the indigenous people of the place. Testimonials of the old folks disclosed that the name of the place was “Ramulog” meaning a place to take a bath. A river at the town proper is a place where the Manobos take a bath. It also became a place of gathering where the men were fishing nearby, their wives washed clothes and the children are either swimming or gathering shells. Over time, “Ramulog” changed to “Damulog” due to assimilation of the Manobos and the new settlers. The river is now called Damulog River. The opening of the Sayre Highway in 1953 opened Damulog into external trade. Manobos and Muslims from nearby Cotabato gathered abaca from the forests and sell it to the traders. The traders processed the abaca into raw fiber and resell it in Cagayan de Oro City process these into fiber. More immigrants from the Visayas came and started to acquire farm lots. Slowly, the new settlers soon dominated trade and business. Damulog celebrates its Araw ng Damulog every 16th day of August with exhilarating activities that comprehends every walk of life. The municipality celebrates its town fiesta every 7th day of October of the year in honor of Our Lady of the Holy Rosary. In line are different activities that draw many expectators from other municipalities and neighboring towns. =Political development= Damulog once a barrio of Kibawe was officially created a regular Municipality in January 1972 pursuant to Republic Act No. 6369. The author was Congressman Cesar \\"Titang\\" Fortich. The approval was on August 16, 1971 and Damulog started as municipality in 1972. Presently, the municipality has seventeen (17) regular barangays, namely: Aludas, Angga-an, Kinapat, Kiraon, Kitingting, Lagandang, Macapari, Maican, Migcawayan, New Compostela, Old Damulog, Omonay, Poblacion, Pocopoco, Sampagar, San Isidro, and Tangkulan. It is difficult to trace the political lineage who handled the reins of power prior to the creation of the barrio of Damulog into a municipality. The kapitan del barrio then was Tito C. Balangyao who assumed as mayor upon its creation as a municipality in 1972. He remained mayor until March 1980 when Emiterio D. Luis won the mayoralty election. At the height of the EDSA People Power revolution, Corazon C. Aquino toppled President Ferdinand E. Marcos and subsequently, Mr. Luis was replaced by Erlito Bagas who was appointed as Officer-In-Charge (OIC) in the Office of the Mayor. After about two months, Rev. Romeo P. Tiongco assumed as mayor. He relinquished his post a year after wherein then Vice Mayor Basilio Beltran assumed the top post. In 1992 election, Emiterio D. Luis again won the mayoralty post. It was during his term that RA 7160 known as the Local Government Code of 1991 was implemented. It was also this time that local governance became multidisciplinary and multifaceted. He finished his three terms in 1998. In July 1998, the first lady chief executive was elected. She was then Josefina G. Tero who served a one-term office. She was succeeded by Fortunato E. Gudito, a retired military intelligence officer, who won the May 2001 local election. He served two terms. In the May 2007 elections, Romeo P. Tiongco contested Gudito and won and is serving now as the incumbent mayor of the municipality of Damulog. Barangays Damulog is politically subdivided into 17 barangays. Climate Demographics In the , the population of Damulog, Bukidnon, was people, with a density of . Infrastructure =Transportation= Damulog is accessible by land transportation.

Traveling from Poblacion is mainly by land through all kinds of vehicles. Damulog is traversed by Sayre Highway. This is from barangay Sampagar in the north to Old Damulog, Poblacion, Pocopoco, Macapari to Omonay in the south. There is concrete road from Poblacion to Kinapat, then all-weather road from Kinapat to Kiraon, then again concrete from Kiraon to Old Damulog forming a complete loop with the Sayre Highway. Another loo is the Sayre Highway in Pocopoco to Kinapat to Poblacion. The third loop is the Poblacion to Doncilyon to Old Damulog. Most of these roads were built with grants from Asian Development Bank under the ARC Program. The Poblacion to Kinapat concrete road is also a part of the program. Barangays Old Damulog and Macapari has covered courts. All 17 barangays have their respective office building, health center, Tanod outpost and complete school buildings. =Water= To focus on other development concern, the local government spun off its water service creating the Damulog Water System. The spinning-off was a part of the grant in 2013 from the SALINTUBIG program of the Department of Health. Before 2013, the water system provides running water for 2 hours every 2 days. Water was so scarce that water cannot reached households away from the transmission line. The new system now provides 24 hour service which is managed by the water district. =Utilities= 17 Barangays enjoy electricity supplied by the First Bukidnon Electric Cooperative or popularly known in the town as FIBECO.

According to the , it has a population of people. History Dangcagan used to be an abode of the Manobos under the leadership of Datu Dangaan (meaning “to praise”), a prominent chieftain ruler known for his courage and affluence. The place was then a little Sitio of Maramag. As the Christian settlers from Luzon & Visayas began to flock and settle in the area. Datu Dangaan followers ran and hide their families in the forest and returned to their home only when they knew the settlers were not around. This leads the settler to call the “Dagandagan”. It took ample time for the settler to befriend the natives. When the natives and the Christian settlers finally united, they made representation to the Municipal Government of Maramag to form a regular barrio within the territory of Datu Dangaan. They agreed to call the barrio Dangcagan in honor of the natives. The first set of officers was headed by Mayor Vicente Cabiling, originally appointed to the position in 1961 and was elected and served for ten (10) consecutive years, he constructed the old Municipal Hall on top of the hill in the poblacion. And from 1972 until March 1986 Mayor Fruto Ll. Dandasan assumed the office. During his time he constructed new roads and maintained the barangay road network of Dangcagan In 1992, Mayor Norberta B.

According to the , it has a population of people. History The first people who settled this place before was a certain Datu Andarol, his wife Ba-e Mahanu, and their son Datu ‘Mangginayun’. Datu Andarol was a ruler and the leader of the Manobo tribe settling the village of Minduso, which was the old name of Don Carlos. The place was covered with forests and access by outlanders was prohibited unless permitted by the datu. Minduso was the home of Datu Andarol's descendants. Upon the arrival of the Spaniards, the datu was succeeded by his son, Datu Mangginayun. With their contacts with the Spaniards and missionaries, Spanish naming conventions and Christianity was introduced, and Datu Mangginayun adopted the name \\"Antonio\\", hence his full name was now Datu ‘Mangginayun’ Antonio Sagandilan Sr. He was married to Ba-e Antonina Manlayuan. His leadership reflects that of his father, as he implemented tribal laws and settled criminal offenses, particularly murder. As the leader of his tribal community, he also presided wedding ceremonies and settled dowries. The first popular Spanish stranger who approached Datu ‘Mangginayun’ Antonio Sr. was Tomás Sandoval. He requested a parcel of land that he intend to borrow and to till, the datu conceded to his request. As part of the agreement, Tomás was to give the part of his harvest as a share to the datu. Several years later, another Spaniard by the name of \\"Elizalde\\" came and, like Tomás, requested the datu for lands to establish ranches. The lands lent by the datu to Elizalde were: lands in Pantil-pantilan, Migtutugop, the lands along the Mulita river, the today-famous Squash Mountain, and the Tugas Falls. As the agricultural ventures of these two Spaniards flourished, Cebuanos (referred by the Lumads, or natives, as \\"Dumagats\\") and other Spaniards who came from Cagayan de Misamis and other coastal towns of Misamis were encouraged to settle and populate the area that comprises the present-day Don Carlos. Census registry for the settlers of Minduso was only located at Ramag (Manobo for ‘breakfast’), which has a fully established local government facilities and would later be known as Maramag. Antonio Sr.'s son, Datu ‘Mangginayun’ Antonio Sagandilan Jr. was born on March 17, 1917 at Miuvan (now Barangay Sinangguyan) and had his birth registered at Maramag. Antonio Jr. was drafted into the USAFFE before World War II and completed his training with the rank of corporal. However, he was called upon to fight on the outbreak of war, and his family did nothing about it. When the war ended, Antonio Jr. succeeded his father in the leadership of his tribe as a datu in 1946. He was first a tribal councilor, and later became a barangay captain of the whole of Minduso. During his time of service, Señora Remedios ‘Meding’ Fortich de Ozamis personally visited Antonio Jr. and she petitioned the name change of Miuvan (which is now Barangay Sinangguyan) to ‘Don Carlos’ in his husband's memory, Don Carlos Azcona Fortich, and as a gratitude for living in the land which the Sagandilans flourished. At first, the datu declined, as the flourishing enclave has significance for their patrimony. Eventually, under Republic Act No. 4800, Minduso and other neighboring villages and barangays were clustered to form the municipality of Don Carlos in 1966.

According to the , it has a population of people. History =Cultural history= During the earlier times, there was a certain ethnic group headed by its chieftain named Datu Mandaganasa. He was then looking for a place located between two rivers as the possible home for his tribe, Kampong. They found vast tracts of land located between the Iniawan and Pinalpalan Rivers and decided to make the place as their territorial domain. As time passed by, the place got its name, Kadingilan from the corrupted native words Kadiay (which means \\"ours\\") and Matingilan (which means \\"temporary\\"). The growth and development of Kadingilan began after World War II. Migrants from all over the country flocked into its fertile lands. The original occupants were slowly replaced by Cebuanos, Boholanos, Warays and Igorots/Ifugaos. The original inhabitants were eventually eased-out by the influx of incoming Dumagats (a general term used for Christians). =Political history= When Bukidnon was created as a separate province from Agusan del Norte, Kadingilan became a barrio of Maramag since 1945. It existed as such until Kibawe was created as a regular municipality on July 1, 1956. Kadingilan was then taken from Maramag and became one of the regular barrios of Kibawe. On August 16, 1971, Kadingilan was created as a municipality of Bukidnon pursuant to Republic Act 6368.). The first set of Municipal Officials who pioneered the development of Kadingilan were: *Bernardino L. Mejorada - Mayor *Epifanio Q. Ramirez - Vice Mayor *Clemente E. Edullantes - Councilor *Pedro T.

Kadingilan is located along the south-western border of the province of Bukidnon. It is bounded on the north by the municipality of Don Carlos; north-east by the municipality of Dancagan; east by the municipality of Kibawe; southeast by the municipality of Damulog and on the south and south-west by the province of North Cotabato and on the west by the province of Lanao del Sur and north-west by the municipality of Pangantucan. =Topography= The topography of the municipality is characterized as rugged terrain with rolling, hilly and mountainous portions.

The Maridugao and Kidanggin Rivers at the southern portion separates Kadingilan from the municipality of Pangantucan and the province of Lanao del Sur. =Climate= The climate of the municipality belongs to type C agro- climatic zone. This zone is the most extensive and covers most of the present and potential agricultural area in the province. Relatively low rainfall is due to rain shadow effect of the mountainous belt on the eastern side of Bukidnon. Rainfall distribution is likely to vary in the southern part of the province because of the presence of adjoining hills and mountain ranges. The heaviest rainfall occurs during the months of May to September. =Elevation= About fifty two percent of the total land area has an elevation of 300–400 meters above sea level while forty percent is between 0–30 m. asl.

It is characterized as light brown to dark brown in color, hard when dry; plastic and sticky when moist and wet and has fair organic matter content. =Drainage/Hydrology= There are two type of drainage identified: internal and external. The former is mainly influenced by soil texture which is the removal of excess water within the soil profile. The latter is influenced by slope and physiographic position, refers to the removal of surface water. Usually when a soil is poorly drained externally, it is also poorly drained internally. Generally, all upland soils like the Kadingilan soils, on the account of their physiographic position are well drained internally and externally.

The Mamadas people were nomadic by nature and subsisted on hunting and forest products. They maintained small plots of corn, camote and gabi in places where they built their temporary shelters. They practised a feudal type of government and were responsible only to their datus who governed as their political chieftain, judge, religious leader and armed-forces chief. The most famous among the “datus” was Datu Mambantayao. Datu Mambantayao's bravery and love for his subjects were unexcelled and remain in the hearts and minds of the people to this day. One of the historic events of his life as a datu was the capturing of a lady whom he loved. She was abducted by a tribe from Bugcaon, Malaybalay, Bukidnon, seventy kilometers away from Kibawe. Datu Mambantayao, along with his armed trained warriors marched to Bugcaon, which they attacked heavily, plundering and killing the Bugcaons’ chieftain for the recovery of the lady who he later married. Datu Mambantayao named this place Kibawe from the word “Guibawe” meaning recovery. Bukidnon was eventually created as a separate province from Agusan. Kibawe became a barrio of Maramag.

The original populace of the town, the Manobos, have practically been replaced by the above-mentioned lowlanders. To date, only a few Manobos remain in the interior barrios. In the year 1972, the big barrios of Damulog and Kadingilan were created into separate municipalities. Thus, Kibawe retained the land area of .

History =Cultural= During the Spanish regime, a Manobo Tribe in Bukidnon, headed by Datu Tayaotao, was known among its neighboring settlements for his bravery and leadership. When the Spaniards invaded Cotabato, in one of their drives to expand their colonial control over the Philippines, Datu Tayaotao was called upon for help by one Datu Muslim. The combined forces of the Muslims and Manobo successfully repulsed the Spanish operation. A feast was declared by the Muslim chief to honor and thank Datu Tayaotao and his men. During the feast, the Muslim chief offered his only daughter to Datu Tayaotao to be his wife, as reward and bond, to strengthen the relation of the two tribes. The wedding took place at Datu Tayaotao’s enclave, followed by a three-day feast. The Muslim Datu, overwhelmed by the gaiety and lavishness of the celebration, proclaimed and called Datu Tayaotao as Datu Kitaotao, the chief of the land of wealth. After his death, the locality was named after Datu Kitaotao. =Political= Kitaotao was once part of the district of Maramag. The creation of Kibawe in 1956 as a new district reclassified Kitaotao as part of Kibawe. After the Second World War, municipalities were created from the existing district and some settlements.

History According to history, gold had flourished in the locality that prompted people from the neighboring towns flocked into this place in their quest for the golden fame and fortune. It was said that on January 17, 1817, A Spanish soldier who was on patrol was tasked to write down the names of the places he would come across within the course of his mission. He happened to pass by a group of men who were digging gold on one of the gold mines. Talking in Spanish, the soldier inquired about the name of the place. The natives, who did not understand the language, thought the soldier was asking them how many gold stones they have already gathered. In response, they answered “libo na” meaning a thousand already. The Spanish soldier jotted the word “Libona” in his record book believing it was the name of the locality. Libona was once a Municipal District of Maluko, now the Municipality of Manolo Fortich, Bukidnon, created under EO No. 5 dated April 4, 1917 issued by then acting Governor Ponciano C. Reyes of the defunct Department of Mindanao and Sulu.

History Before the coming of the Spaniards, the term \\"Bukidnon\\" referred to as the semi-sedentary indigenous inhabitants of the high plateaus and rugged mountain ranges of central Mindanao. The more prominent of these peoples were the \\"Manobos\\" who were the earliest settlers of this region. Located on the northern part of Bukidnon, is the Municipality of Manolo Fortich. The MacArthur Monument in Barangay Diclum, the site of the World War II Del Monte Airfield from which Douglas MacArthur was evacuated to Australia from the Philippines after the fall of Corregidor and Bataan The great pre-historic Asiatic migration was believed to have brought the early settlers of Bukidnon. It was theorized that they came from places of what is now known as Indonesia. Traveling by the sea, these migrants reached the gulf of Davao where some ventured further to areas of what is now known as Bukidnon and Misamis Oriental. The Asiatic beginnings of these people can be seen from their oral tradition and folktales, like the \\"Kalikat Hu Mga Elaw Dini Ta Mindanao\\" (Origin of the People of Mindanao). This folktale revolved on the story of two brothers from Asia \\"who crossed the seas\\" in their long journey \\"towards the east\\" which refers to the islands of the Philippines. The brothers reportedly landed in the island of Mindanao. With the region experiencing a drought, one of the brothers was forced to venture Northward in order to survive. He did this by following a dried up river to its almost dried up source, a lake. He settled and inter-married with the local inhabitants in the upstream of what is now known as Pulangi River. He and his family were considered as the ancestors of the present Bukidnons. The Forest Camp in barangay Dahilayan During the pre-historic era, the Bukidnons, also called Montesses or mountain- people, had settled in the area of what is now the Province of Bukidnon. These people have remained traditional till 1860 preserving most of their customs and traditions. Furthermore, these people had not been significantly influenced by the Spanish colonizers because of their isolation. The rugged mountain ranges and high plateaus which serve as home to these people presented an overwhelming obstacle to these colonizers. The Bukidnons undoubtedly have links to the culture predominant in the Southeast Asian region as evidenced by the similar customs and traditions. Their presence here can be traced to the early migration of these Asians throughout the region.

According to the , it has a population of people. History Maramag from “Ag Ramag”, a contracted Manobo term for “Ag Ramag Ki Dini”, which as freely translated, means “Let us eat our breakfast here.” The story as officially published by the late Prescioso Velez Abellanosa Sr. (a former municipal mayor) goes that the Manobos were constantly in conflict with the Maranaos for supremacy over the locality. Each time they set out for the battle they would stop on the bank of Pulangi River where flat stones that serve as their tables abound the area. Atop of these, they would draw their plans and eat their breakfast. This habit becomes their practice that even in times of peace and as a sign of good faith, these “Lumads”, the natives or early settlers invite others who happen to pass by to partake meals with them. Maramag then was a picnic ground were one can rest and take his meal as a short respite either from travel, trekking, hunting and trapping or from battle. Through the years, even Christians (referred to as \\"Dumagats\\", literally 'seaborne/coming from beyond the sea') started to come and settle near the place. They too would stop and eat their meals on these big flat stones during hunting trips or as they travel on foot from one valley to another. As more and more Christian settlers occupied the surrounding places, Ag Ramag became more commonly called as Maramag – a homonym or a contraction of the original Manobo term “Ag Ramag”. The political history of the municipality traces back in 1916 when the late Deputy Governor Cenon R. Paulican positively declared that people from different parts of the country began settling in the area. Years later, the people informally elected a leader among them as the incipient local government started to take form. They called their leaders “Captain”. These leaders normally remained in office for as long as their political abilities and faithfulness to duty would allow; Monarchial in so many ways although an election process is in place. This system prevailed up to the Second World War. In 1945, the first appointed Mayor was put in place to head the municipal government followed by two others. The first election for the position of the Municipal Mayor was held in 1951. The election for the members of the Barrio Council was held in 1955. From then on, ten other Municipal Mayors were either appointed or elected in the past 56 years up to the present. Maramag was formally created as a municipality through Executive Order No. 272 issued by then President Carlos P. Garcia on July 1, 1956. The Poblacion of Maramag was formerly located in Barangay Base Camp, three (3) kilometers away from the present Poblacion. After World War II and upon the completion of the Sayre Highway, people started to move along the highway in a linear then nodal fashion and later concentrically forming the Poblacion today, composing Barangay North and South Poblacions. The municipal boundaries between Maramag, Pangantucan and Kibawe were established in 1935 by the then deputy Governor Cenon Paulican. Then, Maramag, with the organization of the former barangays Don Carlos and Quezon into regular municipalities, was reduced to its present area of about 58,198.98 hectares. As reported too, in the late sixties, a Memorandum of Agreement between Maramag and Valencia, Bukidnon was forged as to their common boundaries. Purportedly, the Lumbo Creek, as it flows to the Pulangi River defines the demarcation between the two municipalities. Central Mindanao University (CMU) at Musuan, Maramag, Bukidnon The current seat of the government of Maramag consists of two barangays: the North and South Poblacion. When the Central Mindanao University (CMU) is transferred to Musuan, Dologon, Maramag, Bukidnon from Managok, Malaybalay, Bukidnon, the municipality became the host of the premier agricultural school in Mindanao.

According to the , it has a population of people. History The natives of Bukidnon known as Tigwahanons and Matigsalugs were the original inhabitants of this area. They settled along the fertile river valleys of the Tigwa and Salug rivers. These people were nomadic by nature and subsisted mainly by hunting and eating forest products but they also maintained small plots of corn and root crops in places where they built their temporary shelters. They have a feudal type of government headed by a political chieftain known as “Datu”, who also acted as their religious leader and armed forces chief. The municipality was formerly a district of the municipalities of Maramag, Dangcagan and Valencia City pursuant to Executive Order No. 347 of President Carlos P. Garcia dated July 29, 1959. During the reign of Gov. Teodoro Oblad and Cong. Cesar Fortich, a proposal was submitted to the defunct Congress for the creation of this district into municipality. On June 18, 1966, San Fernando was created into a municipality under R.A. 4789 and was named in honor of Fernando Damasco, the Father of former Gov. Catalino Damasco. The first set of government was installed at Barangay Namnam, approximately 48 kilometers away from Valencia City. The government resettlement program for Mindanao during the 1960s and 1970s attracted immigrants from Luzon and the Visayas. The arrival of the migrants, attracted by the town's rich agricultural potential, created more settlements in the area and contributed much in the development of the area. The original occupants of the town, the Tigwahanon and the Matigsalug, were then replaced by these lowlanders or “dumagats””. Only few natives remained in the lowland and the majority of them settled in the interior and mountainous areas of the municipality. On July 27, 1970, the municipal council passed a resolution transferring the seat of government from Namnam to Barangay Halapitan. Halapitan - The present town of Halapitan used to be an abaca farm of Victoriano Bantug who served as mayor in the 70's. Mr. Tamin, a teacher in Namnam used to drop by at Mr. Bantug's house in present Halapitan on his way to Malaybalay, thus the word \\"Hapit\\", or drop by. Talangihon which is now Comawas was the loading dock for bamboo rafts as inhabitants sail along Tigoa River connecting Pulangui River onto Lumbayao. Mr. Bantug eventually distributed lands to newcomers and eventually the name Halapitan stayed on \\" Hapitanan\\".

He wrote over 32 volumes on topics such as painting, poetics, sculpture, alchemy, medicine, logic, philosophy and tantra.Chogyam Trungpa; The Tantric Path of Indestructible Wakefulness (volume 3) Mipham's works are still central to the scholastic curriculum in Nyingma monasteries today.Duckworth (2011), page 46 Mipham is also considered one of the leading figures in the Ri-me (non-sectarian) movement in Tibet.Reginald A. Ray; Indestructible Truth: The Living Spirituality of Tibetan Buddhism, 2002, chapter 9. Derivation of name \\"Ju\\" (\\"holding\\") was Mipham's family name as his paternal clan is said to have originated as clear light deities who came to the human world holding a rope. \\"Jamgön\\" (Skt. Mañjuśrī) indicate that he was considered to be an emanation of the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī. His maternal uncle, Minister-Lama Drupchok Pema Tarjay, named him Mipham Gyamtso (\\"Invincible Ocean\\" or \\"Unconquerable Ocean\\").Pettit 1999 p.24 In Tibetan literature, the word \\"mi-pham\\" is the standard translation of the Sanskrit \\"ajita\\", meaning \\"unconquered\\",http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni- koeln.de/scans/MWScan/tamil/index.html which is a common epithet of the celestial bodhisattva Maitreya.http://www.thlib.org/reference/dictionaries/tibetan- dictionary/translate.php Biography =Early life= Mipham the Great was born to an aristocratic family in 1846 in the Derge Principality of Kham or Eastern Tibet. He was recognized as an exceptional child from a young age, memorizing texts as early as age six. By the age of ten he had already composed many texts. At twelve, he entered the monastery as an ordinary monk of the Ogmin Urgyen Mindrolling lineage at a branch monastery of the great Nyingma seat Shechen. When he was fifteen or sixteen, after studying the very difficult Mindrolling system of chanting for only a few days and praying to Manjushri, he is said to have completely mastered it. In an 18-month retreat he accomplished the form of Manjushri known as 'Lion of Philosophers' (Tibetan: smra ba'i seng ge), using a liturgy composed by the fifteenth Karmapa, Khakhyab Dorje. He made many medicinal pills blessed with Manjushri's mantra, and many miraculous signs were said to have been manifest. After this, it was said that he could accomplish any sutra or tantra without any effort, and no text was unknown to him. He went to many lamas to obtain the necessary lungs (oral transmissions), but he needed no study or teachings for any texts. =Teachers= Mipham was \\"a luminary of the nineteenth century Nyingma renaissance and Rime movement ecumenical movement, which started in the Kham region of eastern Tibet\\".Phuntsho (2005) p.13 As such he received teachings from masters of all lineages Nyingma and Sarma alike. His root gurus were Dza Patrul Rinpoche, from whom he received instruction on Shantideva's Bodhicharyavatara and Dzogchen and the renowned master Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, from whom he received transmission of the orally transmitted or Kama and revealed or Terma lineages, and many other teachings. His other teachers included Jamgon Kongtrul Lodro Thaye; Dzogchen Khenpo Padma Vajra; Lab Kyabgon Wangchen Gyerab Dorje; Jubon Jigme Dorje; Bumsar Geshe Ngawang Jungne and Ngor Ponlop Jamyang Loter Wangpo.Smith (2001) p.230 Philosophy A key theme in Mipham's philosophical work is the unity of seemingly disparate ideas such as duality and nonduality, conceptual and nonconceptual (nirvikalpa) wisdom, rational analysis and uncontrived meditation,Duckworth; Jamgon Mipam, His life and teachings, Pg 76 presence and absence, immanence and transcendence, emptiness and Buddha nature.Duckworth, Mipham on Buddha Nature, xiii. Mimicking the Sarma schools, Mipham attempted to reconcile the view of tantra, especially Dzogchen, with sutric Madhyamaka.Koppl, Heidi. Establishing Appearances as Divine. Snow Lion Publications 2008. This was in departure with the Nyingma school which generally positioned the view of tantra as superior to the view of Madhyamaka. For Mipam, the unity of philosophical views is ultimately resolved in the principle of coalescence (Sanskrit: yuganaddha, Tib: zung 'jug), which is the nonduality of conventional and ultimate realities, of samsara and nirvana.Pettit, John W; Mipham's Beacon of Certainty: Illuminating the View of Dzogchen, the Great Perfection. Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism (Volume II), 2002, page 4. Unlike Tsongkhapa who held that emptiness, as an absolute negation, was the definitive reality and view, Mipham sees coalescence of gnosis and emptiness, form and emptiness, etc. as \\"the ultimate hermeneutical cornerstone of his interpretations\\".Pettit, John W; Mipham's Beacon of Certainty: Illuminating the View of Dzogchen, the Great Perfection. Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism (Volume II), 2002, page 131. In his many texts Mipham explores the tension and dialectic that arises between philosophical reasoning of the ordinary mind (rnam shes) which is represented by the Madhyamaka philosophy and luminous nonconceptual wisdom (ye shes), which is the focus of the teachings of Dzogchen. He attempts a synthesis of them to show that they are not incompatible perspectives and that the teachings of Dzogchen are in line with reason.Duckworth; Jamgon Mipam, His life and teachings, Pg 77 =Two models of the Two Truths= Mipham developed a twofold model of the Buddhist two truths doctrine. The first model is the traditional Madhyamaka perspective which presents the two truths of emptiness and appearance, with emptiness representing the level of ultimate truth and appearance representing relative truth. In this model the two truths are really the same reality and are only conceptually distinct.Duckworth; Jamgon Mipam, His life and teachings, Pg 78. In his second model of the two truths, Mipham presents an authentic truth and an inauthentic truth. Authentic experience is any perception that is in accord with reality (gnas snang mthun) and perceptions which do not are said to be inauthentic. This differs from the first model because in the first model only emptiness is ultimate while in the second model the ultimate truth is the meditative experience of unitary wisdom. Instead of just being a negation, it includes the subjective content of the cognition of wisdom as well as the objective nature of reality. In this model the ultimate truth is also reality experienced nonconceptually, without duality and reification, which in Dzogchen is termed rigpa, while the relative truth is the conceptual mind (sems).Duckworth; Jamgon Mipam, His life and teachings, Pg 80-81 According to Mipham these two models do not conflict. They are merely different contextually; the first relates to the analysis of experience post meditatively and the second corresponds to the experience of unity in meditative equipose.Duckworth; Jamgon Mipam, His life and teachings, Pg 81. This synthesis by Mipam is ultimately a bringing together of two different perspectives in Tibetan philosophy, rangtong and shentong, which Mipam associated with the teachings of the second turning (Prajnaparamita sutras) and third turning (Yogacara and Buddha nature sutras) respectively:Duckworth; Jamgon Mipam, His life and teachings, Pg 82. > The emptiness taught in the middle wheel and the exalted body and wisdom > taught in the last wheel should be integrated as a unity of emptiness and > appearance. Without dividing or excluding the definitive meaning subject > matters of the middle and last wheels, both should be held to be the > definitive meaning in the way of just this assertion by the omniscient > Longchen Rapjam. - Lion's Roar, exposition of Buddha nature.Duckworth, > Jamgon Mipam, His life and teachings, 145. For Mipham, both of these teachings are definitive and a middle way between both of them is the best way to avoid the extremes of nihilism and essentialism.Duckworth; Jamgon Mipam, His life and teachings, Pg 85. =Fourfold Valid Cognition= Another original contribution of Mipham is his system of fourfold valid cognition (pramana) which has two conventional and two ultimate valid cognitions:Duckworth; Jamgon Mipam, His life and teachings, Pg 87-88. Conventional valid cognitions *Confined perception, ordinary valid experience *Pure vision free of distortion Ultimate valid cognitions *Categorized Ultimate, emptiness as a negation known by mind *Uncategorized Ultimate, nonconceptual wisdom Work and legacy As scholar Robert Mayer remarks, Mipham \\"completely revolutionised rNying ma pa scholasticism in the late 19th century, raising its status after many centuries as a comparative intellectual backwater, to arguably the most dynamic and expansive of philosophical traditions in all of Tibetan Buddhism, with an influence and impact far beyond the rNying ma pa themselves.\\"Review by Robert Mayer of Mipham’s Dialectics and the Debates on Emptiness: To Be, Not to Be or Neither. Buddhist Studies Review 23(2) 2006, 268 =Scope= In the Introduction to his critical study of the ontological debates between Mipham and his Gelugpa opponents (Mipham's Dialectics and the Debates on Emptiness) Lopon Karma Phuntsho defines Mipham as a polymath and gives this assessment of the scope of Mipham's work: Mipham's works on both the exoteric or Sutrayana teachings and the esoteric or Vajrayāna teachings have become core texts within the Nyingma tradition. These works now hold a central position in the curriculum of all Nyingma monasteries and monastic colleges — occupying a place of esteem similar to the works of Sakya Pandita and Gorampa in the Sakya tradition; those of Tsongkhapa in the Gelug tradition and of Kunkhyen Padma Karpo in the Drukpa Kagyu. Together with Rongzompa and Longchenpa, Mipham is considered to be one of the three \\"omniscient\\" writers of the Nyingma tradition. =Commentaries on Buddhist Śāstra= Although Mipham wrote on a wide range of subjects, Prof. David Germano identifies the most influential aspect of Mipham's career in that he \\"was the single most important author in the efflorescence of Nyingma exoteric literature in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Grounding himself theoretically in the writings of Longchenpa and other great Nyingma authors, Mipham produced brilliant exegetical commentaries on the great Indian philosophical systems and texts with a Nyingma orientation.\\".Germano (2002) E. Gene Smith also judged that Mipham's greatest contribution was \\"in his brilliant and strikingly original commentaries on the Indian treatises.\\"Smith (2001) p. 231 Prior to Mipham, Nyingmapa scholars \\"had seldom written detailed pedagogical commentaries on the śāstras of exoteric Buddhism.\\" Until his time the colleges or shedra associated with the great Nyingma monasteries of Kham, such as Dzogchen, Shechen, Kathog, Palyul and Tarthang lacked their own exegetical commentaries on these exoteric Mahayana śāstras, and students commonly studied Gelug commentaries on these fundamental texts. Grounding himself in the writings of Śāntarakṣita, Rongzom Chokyi Zangpo, and Longchenpa, Mipham produced a whole array of brilliant exegetical commentaries on the great Indian philosophical systems and texts that clearly articulated a Nyingma orientation or view. The texts include his commentaries on the Mulamadhyamakakarika or Fundamental Stanzas on Wisdom by Nagarjuna; the Introduction to the Middle Way (Sanskrit: Madhyamakāvatāra) of Chandrakirti; the Quintessence of all Courses of Ultimate Wisdom (Jnanasarasamuccaya) of Aryadeva; commentaries on the major works of the Indian Buddhist logicians Dharmakirti and Dignaga; commentaries on the Five Treatises of Maitreya most notably, the Abhisamayalamkara; commentaries on several works of Vasubandhu including the Abhidharmakosha. Mipham's commentary on the ninth chapter of Shantideva's Bodhicaryavatara, the Shertik Norbu Ketaka (),Kapstein, Matthew T. (2000). 'We Are All Gzhan stong pas: Reflections on The Reflexive Nature of Awareness: A Tibetan Madhyamaka Defence. By Paul Williams.' Journal of Buddhist Ethics. Volume 7. . Source: (accessed: Sunday November 8, 2009) \\"threw Tibetan scholarly circles into several decades of heated controversy,\\" but \\"it was not the only tempest Mipham's new expositions raised.\\" His commentary on the Madhyamakalamkara of Śāntarakṣita was also considered highly controversial. =Commentaries on Tantras= Mipham's commentary on the Guhyagarbha Tantra is entitled The Essence of Clear Light or Nucleus of Inner Radiance ()— it is based on Longchenpa's commentary, Dispelling Darkness in the Ten Directions which explains the Guhyagarbha from the Dzogchen point of view. Mipham showed particular interest in the Kalachakra and the kingdom of Shambhala, and one of his last and most extensive of his esoteric works are his two volumes of commentary, initiation and sadhana related to the Kalachakra Tantra, the esoteric teaching from Shambhala. Before he died in 1912, he said to his students that now he was going to Shambhala. =Mipham and Gesar= Throughout his life, Mipham showed a particular interest in the legend of the warrior king Gesar of Ling, a 12th-century figure whose epic is well-known and widely celebrated in eastern Tibet, and about whom Mipham wrote extensively. The Gesar practice, known as \\"The Swift Accomplishment of Enlightened Activity Through Invocation and Offering\\" () arose in the mind of Mipham as a gong-ter and was written down over the course of 3 years from the age of 31 to 34. This practice invokes Gesar and his retinue and requests him to assist practitioners.Söllo Chenmo =Medicine= Mipham's medical works continue to be highly regarded to this day.Smith (2001) p.231. =Astrology and divination= Mipham also wrote extensively about astrology which was, in his words, a \\"delightful game\\" that he mastered in his teens but later applied to more serious topics such as medicine; these two topics, with various texts on more or less related topics of divination, occupy perhaps 2,000 pages of his writing. An entire volume of Mipham's is devoted to Ju-thig or divination using knots, a method that might be termed \\"Bon\\" in origin, for want of a more accurate term; this may have been the legacy of his family, who were doctors for several generations. Throughout his writings there are many resources for divination, in addition to astrology, including several rituals for looking in mirrors (pra-mo), one using dice (mo), pulling different-length 'arrows' (Wylie: da dar) out of a quiver and so on, compelling a non-human \\"bird\\" to whisper future news in one's ear, and so on. In one short text he prescribes various methods of divination (all drawn, Mipham emphasizes, from Tantric scriptures and commentaries) that make use of unusual sources of augury such as: the vicariously overheard chatter of women; sudden appearance of various animals, especially birds; weather phenomena; the shape, size and color of flames in the agnihotra or fire puja; the quality of burning butter lamps, especially the size of the flame, the amount and shape of smoke that arises; and the size and shape of the carbon deposit on the wick. When some of his scholarly rivals thought it inappropriate for a monk to devote so much time to matters of future events, Mipham wrote a short essay explaining the purpose of divination, citing sources in the Sutras and Tantras where the utility and value of divination are explained. Students Mipham’s most important students were Dodrub Rinpoche, Terton Sogyal, the Fifth Dzogchen Rinpoche, Gemang Kyab Gon, Khenpo Padmavajra, Katog Situ Rinpoche, Sechen Rabjam, Gyaltsab Tulku, Palyul Gyaltrul, Karma Yangtrul, Palpung Situ Rinpoche, Ling Jetrung, Adzom Drukpa (1842-1924), Togdan Shakya Shri, Ngor Ponlob, and others. The great tulkus of Sechen, Dzogchen, Katog, Palyul, Palpung, Dege Gonchen, Repkong and others of all lineages, Sakya, Gelug, Kagyu, and Nyingma, all became his disciples. Emanations of Ju Mipham According to one account shortly before he died, Mipham told his attendant: This may be interpreted as a statement that his mindstream would have no further 'emanations' (Wylie: sprul pa (tulpa); sprul sku (tulku)). Conversely, according to another account in which he mentions the mindstream in passing and prophesies the shortly before his death to his student Khenpo Kunphel: In the above account, shortly after the departure of Khenpo Kunphel he stated publicly, \\"Now, soon I shall depart. I shall not be reborn again in Tibet, therefore do not search for me. I have reason to go to Shambhala in the north.\\"Dharma Fellowship: The Life of Mipham Jamyang Namgyal (1846–1912) Subsequently, a number of emanations have been recognized. According to E. Gene Smith \\"At least three rebirths were recognized in the decade following his death: 1) Zhe chen Mi pham (a grandnephew of Mi pham rgya mtsho); 2) Tshe dbang bdud 'dul (1915/16-42) the last prince of Sde dge; 3. Khyung po Mi pham, an incarnation recognized by Rdzong gsar Mkhyen brtse 'Jam dbyangs chos kyi blo gros.\\"Smith 2001 p.272 The next (third) Mipham in the line of the Dege Prince who died in 1942 was apparently born in Tibet in 1949 and recognised by Tengye Rinpoche of Lab i 1959 At that time he was enthroned and given responsibility for all monasteries previously held by the first and second incarnations. This third incarnation was also confirmed by Patrul Rinpoche who gave him relics of the previous incarnations and by Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, who he had recognized in a previous incarnation. This Mipham incarnate is the father of Thaye Dorje, one of two candidates to be recognized as the 17th Karmapa, and of 14th Sonam Tsemo Rinpoche, an important Gelug/Sakya tulku.Curren 2006: \\"Buddha's not smiling\\", Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 225. In 1995, Ösel Rangdröl Mukpo (b. 1962), the eldest son of renowned dharma master Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche and Ani Könchok Palden, was recognized as a reincarnation of Mipham Rinpoche by HH Drubwang Padma Norbu Rinpoche, at the time the head of the Nyingma lineage. He is now known as Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche, and is the spiritual head of Shambhala International.

According to the , it has a population of people. Etymology The word “Sumilao” came from a Bukidnon phrase \\"Kon sumilaw da”, which means “When light comes again.” A story has been told that there lived a man named Walu who possessed supernatural powers. Many believed that he lives somewhere in Kilabong a place near Palaopao Hill. Time came when seven “baylan” (spiritual leaders who possessed special powers) who were living at the plain below fabricated degrading stories against Walu. This angered him. Standing on the hill, he shouted at the top of his voice and pointed to the seven men rebuking them for their evil intentions. At this instant, bright, glaring light emitted from the tip of the pointing finger and the seven “baylan” were blinded. It was said that their eyesight will be restored when the same light will come again. History Oral history from the town’s old- time residents stated that before the Spanish colonization, the present site of the Poblacion was already inhabited. Four big buildings housing several families were already constructed. These families were directly controlled by a settlement datu or chief. They have grouped together to protect themselves from the fierce “mangangayaw” or headhunters from the hills. When the Spaniards came, Datu Manlomero and Opecio, with their men, fought against the invading conquistadores. Unfortunately, the natives were defeated due to the inferiority of their weapons. So they laid down their arms and accepted the new ruler. They were baptized to the Christian religion. In the 1860s, the Recollect missionaries were already making visits to Sumilao. When the Jesuit priests took over the missionary work in Bukidnon in the 1870s, Sumilao was already one of the rancherias of the Visita of Tagoloan. Regular missionary trips to Sumilao and Linabo were intensified by Fathers Juan Terricarbas and Eusebio Barrado. By 1887, there were 200 Christian residents of the Rancheria de Sumilao. In January 1890, Sumilao was created into the first active mission station in Bukidnon, thus making her the nucleus of the Roman Catholic faith in the province. Mission de Sumilao assumed jurisdiction over the rancherias of Tagoloan up to Bugcaon, formerly all under the parish of Tagoloan. Sumilao was now under the Residencia de Balingasag. The name rancheria was later changed to reduccion de Nuevo Cristianos. By 1891, Mission de Sumilao had 15 reducciones with a combined Christian population of 8, 399. The reduccion of Sumilao, however had 11, 340 inhabitants. Father Eusebio Barrado was the missionary curate during that time. In 1893, Mission de Mailag (Mailag) was created. This reduced the number of reducciones of Mission de Sumilao. By 1894, the mission had only 4, 122 Christian inhabitants. During the Spanish colonizations, the local datu were appointed to political positions by the missionary priests. These political leaders were under the administrative control of the higher authorities who are stationed at Misamis Oriental. Some of these local leaders were Capitanes Dalahigon, Alejo Yansao – alis Mandita, Akuman and Tao. In 1907, the American took over the administration of Bukidnon. The town’s chief was now called president. In 1914, Sumilao was one of the communities created into municipal districts of Bukidnon pursuant to Executive Order No. 10 issued by Frank Carpenter, Governor of the Department of Mindanao and Sulu on August 15, 1914. It was also during the American regime that a parochial school known as Little Flower Academy flourished. Its operation, however, lasted only up to the outbreak of World War II. The Catholic Church and the school building were bombed by the American fighter planes in 1944. Mr. Juan Sumbalan was the president sometime in the 1920s up to the outbreak of the war. Under the Japanese military government, Mr, Restituto Parista was appointed as the town’s chief. During the war, several young and brave men of Sumilao joined the guerilla resistance movement. Some of these men were Lieutenants Candido G. Sumbalan and Alejandro Sale. When liberation came, Mr, Juan Sumbalan, who returned to power, ordered some of his men to settle in Kisolon to protect themselves from the Japanese stragglers who were still roaming in the vicinity of Poblacion, Sumilao. Kisolon which was then a part of Impasugong, was formerly a ranch owned by a certain Guingona. When Mr. Juan Sumbalan died in 1945, Mr. Restituto Parista was appointed to the vacated position. In 1953, Mr, Martin Langue replaced Mr. Parista. However, he did not stay long for on that same year, Mr. Candido G. Sumbalan was appointed Mayor by Provincial Governor Marcus A. Reciña. =Political Birth of the Municipality= Although Sumilao was one of the early missionary centers of Bukidnon, its economic and political growth was quite slow. This could be attested by the fact that by 1917, four municipal districts of the province were organized into regular municipalities. These municipalities have bigger populations and their leaders were politically prepared to administer the affairs of their respective municipalities. Population conducted during the period of 1918-1948 showed that Sumilao has the lowest number of inhabitants compared to the other municipal districts. It has only one barangay in the 1900s (Barangay Puntian). Sumilao became a regular municipality on July 1, 1956 pursuant to Executive Order No. 272 signed by the President Carlos P. Garcia. The following were the elected and appointed officials of the municipality from its establishment up to the present. =The Sumilao Farmers' March= The Sumilao Farmers On December 3, 2007, 55 farmers of the Higaonon tribe from Sumilao arrived in Metro Manila, 2 months after their march through 13 provinces from Mindanao to ask the government to stop the conversion of the land they are claiming into a hog farm. They farmers petitioned the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) to issue a cease-and-desist order (CDO) on the contested 144-hectare property in Barangay (village) San Vicente, Sumilao which San Miguel Foods Inc. (SMFI) converted into a hog farm. The Supreme Court of the Philippines had earlier dismissed the farmers' rights lack of legal standing. Farmer Tuminhay stated that: “Our titles were cancelled because Norberto Quisumbing was allowed to convert his land on condition that he would implement a five-year development plan. Since he did not implement the plan, it is only proper that DAR renew the CARP process and give us back our titles.” Quisumbing's development plan for the property included the establishment of a development academy, a cultural center, an institute for livelihood science, a museum, library, golf course, a sports development complex, an agro-industrial park, forest development and support facilities, and construction of a 360-room hotel, restaurant, housing projects, inter alia. Inquirer.net, Protesting Sumilao farmers reach Manila After 2-month march from Mindana On December 17, 2007, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo revoked the conversion order on the disputed 144-hectare lot in Sumilao, resulting to the return of the land ownership to the 55 members of the Higaonon tribe farmers who marched 1,700 kilometers for 2 months from Mindanao to Metro Manila. The order, signed by Executive Secretary Eduardo Ermita, reads: “Wherefore premises considered and as recommended by DAR, the petition for cancellation and/or revocation of the conversion order covering 144 hectares of land…is hereby granted.” San Miguel Foods as landowner must be paid the current value of the property before the land can be distributed to the farmers. Inquirer.net, Palace restores Sumilao land to agricultural use In March 2008, San Miguel and the Sumilao farmers signed a deal giving 50 hectares to the farmers. The farmers will get a total of 144 hectares, which is equivalent in size of the original property they sought for.

According to the , it has a population of people. It is located on the border to major cities of Cagayan de Oro and Iligan, and between Marawi City and Malaybalay, the provincial capital. Etymology Once in the not so distant past, a nomadic tribe wandered down south. Finally, they settled upon a place attuned to their needs and liking. The place, was traversed by a zigzagging creek swollen with clear sparkling water where on its banks grew in abundance wild Malayan trees called “Balangas” (now popularly known as Rambutan – Nephelium lappaceum of the Family: Sapindaceae). The trees were full of attractive bloody red but juicy and delicious fruits, clustered in their very green foliages. Because of fanatical attachment of this tribe to these balangas trees, they decided to name their settlement “Kabalangasan” - a very typical way of simply affixing prefixes. This is the original name of the municipality of Talakag. However, names of places are, often, influenced and affected by events that revolve around it. History goes that aside from this Kabalangasan settlement, there was another settlement further down south called “Dagundalahon”. At first, tribes of both settlements were very friendly and cordial to each other. They would hold social gatherings, \\"Kaamulan\\" and 'Kaliga\\" and other forms of intimate social merry- makings to satisfy their whims and caprices often with paganic undertones. This relationship did not last long. A serious breakdown developed and as a consequence, they became bitter enemies. The root cause was the intense rivalry of men/warriors over beautiful and alluring women from either side. This resulted and accounted for ambush, kidnappings and to some extent even killings. It was on the Kabalangasan side that men are more daring and aggressive. They adopted and ventured into the “go-chase-kidnap” tactics preying on the women of Dagundalahon who caught their fancy. Because of these, hill tribes in Dagundalahon side renamed “Kabalangasan” to Talakag, the etymology of which came from the Visayan dialect- LAKAG meaning \\"to go after” or “follow in pursuit” and the prefix “TA” denoting “fondness in doing such”. In other words, Talakag means “fondness in giving pursuit”. Thus, the settlement that was known as Kabalangasan was named Talakag while the creek traversing the place retained the name Kabalangasan. History In the late 14th Century, the seat of the highland government was established in Kinolosanglay at Tikalaan headed by Datu Man-utob, a wise and brave ruler. The Datu was described as an imposing giant of a man who has a big mole at the center of his nose bridge. His court was composed of Datu Aliga, Datu Lumbac and Datu Limbubongan (descent from Sharif Alawi). His ambassador was Datu Malinkayao, who was also called Sumagayon. The jurisdiction of the kingdom of Datu Man-utob embraced the areas of Cosina, which was ruled by Mansalingay; Dagundalahon which was ruled by Datu Manlugwas; Langawon under the rule of Datu Mantingal; Landang, ruled by Datu Mancabo; Alanib ( now of Lantapan, Bukidnon) under the rules of Datu Malongmong and Datu Manbailana; Mandugao and Salagapon, which was ruled by Datu Tomopa; Tapagkal, ( now of Pangantukan, Bukidnon) ruled by Datu Magayao, Datu Maka-andig, Datu Dupao and Datu Miaday; Damulog which was ruled by Datu Labawan, who was also called Maganuna; Macahambus which was ruled by Datu Manpaklawan; and Tumalaung, which was ruled by Datu Mambalintas and Datu Manbalagon. Datu Man-utob was such a respected ruler that all the datus under him were all in awe of him. Even the Datus of Cagayhaan (now Cagayan de Oro City) ruled by Datus Abaga, Binandina and Ganza, Datus Tombalan, Mansingkatol, Manimohod, Mansihabo, Tingkayogan, Yagoma and Magoliok, all of Tagoloan and of Maguindanao and Ditsaan (now Lanao del Sur) respected and feared him. He was so well known that even Sultan Kabungsuan (also known as Sharif Kabunsuan, the youngest brother of Sharif Alawi) and other Muslim leaders visited him at Tikalaan several times to establish good relationship during the propagation of Islam. During this time Mindanao, tribal wars were prevalent. The inhabitants in the coastal areas could not go up to the mountains for fear of ambush and killings; neither could the inhabitants in the mountains go to the coastal areas. Thus, in response to the request of the Muslims who were already well established in Maguindanao, Lanao, Sulu and Tagoloan, Datu Man-utob acceded to the call for peace among the rulers of Mindanao. He hosted a peace treaty at Tikalaan called TAMPUDA HA APAT HA PASAGI TA PUSOD TA DAGAT (a Binukid term meaning “Peace Treaty of Four Rulers in Central Mindanao”). The terms of the treaty was specific – to achieve peace for them to live in an atmosphere of justice and tranquility. Transgressors were dealt with accordingly. Further, intermarriages between their people were encouraged. To mark this momentous event in history, a durian tree (Durio zibethinus – Bombacaceae) which has until very recently succumbed to old age and a species of rattan were planted and a gold cross, porcelain jars, a Koran, needles and some other items that were soaked in carabao blood were buried right on top of the spot where the treaty was held. A piece of rattan was cut into pieces and each ruler was given a portion to even make the event memorable. All of these are recorded in the \\"Sil-Sila or Sal-sila\\" of the Maranaos, the Skrit of the Maguindanaos and the Halads of the Higaonons. Not long after the peace treaty in Tikalaan, the Spaniards came to Cagayan de Oro to establish their seat of government. Likewise, they came to Tikalaan where they gave the reigning datu a Spanish flag and a cabo negro cane. The Spaniards were known to be suppressive to people who try to thwart their imperial rule. However the inhabitants were subservient to foreign domination, hence, there was no known occurrence of any serious trouble between them. Sometime in 1902, the Americans arrived in Cagayan de Oro. The American regime encouraged the people to participate in running the government thus, in 1904 Man Sayagnon was appointed 1st Mayor of Talakag. He held office at Patpat, which is now San Isidro and his term of office expired in 1906. In 1906, Amay Tigsay was appointed Mayor of Talakag and he continued to hold office at Patpat until 1908 where Man Sayagnon was again appointed Mayor and was in office until 1910. In 1910, Jose Levanta, son of Man Sayagnon, was elected Mayor and was in office until 1918. It was Jose Levanta, who transferred the seat of government from Patpat to the present site of the municipal government of Talakag. In World War II, Talakag appeared to have been occupied for virtually the entire war by guerrillas opposing the Japanese occupation of Mindanao. From June 8 to 29, 1944, the Japanese attacked the area. Lieut. Col. James Grinstead had his headquarters in Talakag and before a force of 500 Japanese and Korean troops could take the town, Grinstead ordered his headquarters burned. On June 28 the Japanese-Korean force left Talakag and the guerrillas moved back into town and re-established their headquarters there.Kent Holmes, Wendell Fertig and His Guerrilla Forces in the Philippines: Fighting the Japanese Occupation, 1942-1945 (Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland & Co., 2015), pp. 114-5.

The film stars Pomeroy Cannon, Josef Swickard, Bridgetta Clark, Rudolph Valentino, Wallace Beery, and Alice Terry.The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse at silentera.com Often regarded as one of the first true anti-war films, it had a huge cultural impact and became the top-grossing film of 1921, beating out Charlie Chaplin's The Kid. The film turned then-little-known actor Rudolph Valentino into a superstar and associated him with the image of the Latin Lover. The film also inspired a tango craze and such fashion fads as gaucho pants.Leider, Emily W., Dark Lover: The Life and Death of Rudolph Valentino, p. 219 The film was written by June Mathis, who, with its success, became one of the most powerful women in Hollywood at the time.Alt Film Guide.Journal of Humanities. 2007. In 1995, The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". The film is now in the public domain, having been made before 1923. A DVD version was released in 2000 but is now out of print. The film is now available for free download on the Internet Archive.3 The Four Horsemen on the Apocalypse on the Internet Archive. Plot The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse Madariaga \\"The Centaur\\" (Pomeroy Cannon), a harsh but popular Argentine landowner, has a German son- in-law whom he dislikes and a French one whose family he openly favors. He is particularly fond of his grandson Julio (Rudolph Valentino), with whom he often carouses at seedy dives in the Boca district of Buenos Aires. In one of these bars, the movie's famous tango sequence occurs. A man and a woman (Beatrice Dominguez) are dancing the tango. Julio strides up and asks to cut in. The woman stares at Julio alluringly. The man brushes him off, and they resume dancing. Julio then challenges the man and strikes him, knocking him into some tables and out of the scene. Julio and the woman then dance a dramatic version of the tango that brings cheers from the people in the establishment. Following the dance, the woman sits on Julio's lap. Madariaga then slides to the floor, drunk. The woman laughs at Madariaga. Julio casts her aside in scorn and helps his grandfather home. Sometime later, Madariaga dies. The extended family breaks up, one half returning to Germany and the other to France. In Paris, Julio enjoys a somewhat shiftless life as a would- be artist and sensation at the local tea dances. He falls in love with Marguerite Laurier (Alice Terry), the unhappy and much younger wife (by an arranged marriage) of Etienne Laurier, a friend of Julio's father. The affair is discovered, and Marguerite's husband agrees to give her a divorce to avoid a scandal. It seems as though Julio and Marguerite will be able to marry, but both end up getting caught up in the start of the Great War. The scene where the man upstairs (Nigel de Brulier) shows Julio (Valentino) and his manservant (Bowditch M. Turner) the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Marguerite becomes a nurse in Lourdes. The bravery of Etienne is reported, and he is blinded in battle. Etienne happens to end up at the hospital where she is working, and Marguerite attends to him there. Julio travels to Lourdes to see Marguerite and instead sees her taking care of Etienne. Julio, ashamed of his wastrel life, enlists in the French Army. In the meantime, the German Army overruns Julio's father Marcelo's Marne Valley castle in the First Battle of the Marne. Marcelo is forced to host a German general and staff in the castle. One of Marcelo's three German nephews is amongst the staff and tries to protect him, but Marcelo is arrested after a melee involving an officer's assault of a woman. Marcello is to be executed in the morning, but his life is spared when the French Army counterattacks in the \\"Miracle of the Marne\\". The castle is destroyed by the French counterattack. Four years later Julio has survived and become renowned for his bravery in the trenches at the front. During a mission in no man's land, he encounters his last surviving German cousin. Moments later, they are both killed by a shell. Back in Paris, Marguerite considers abandoning the blinded Etienne, but Julio's ghost guides her to continue her care for him. The ending scene shows Marcelo Desnoyers mourning over his son's grave. The man who lived upstairs from Julio watches over him. Marcelo asks him, \\"Did you know my son?\\" The man, with a remorseful expression, lifts his arms, forming the shape of a cross with his body, and says \\"I knew them all!\\" He then points to the sky and shows Marcelo the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse riding away into the clouds. With this, the man assures him that \\"Peace has come—but the Four Horsemen will still ravage humanity—stirring unrest in the world—until all hatred is dead and only love reigns in the heart of mankind.\\" Cast The tango sequence Production The affair between Julio (Valentino) and Marguerite (Terry) was considered scandalous by many for its time, as Marguerite was married to Etienne Laurier (St. Polis). In 1919, screenwriter June Mathis became head of the scenario department for Metro Pictures.Maher. 2006. p.200 With this position, she became one of the first female executives in film history. Holding a major belief in Spiritualism and the Book of Revelation, Mathis was determined to turn Vicente Blasco Ibáñez's novel The Four Horseman of the Apocalypse into a film. The book had been a best seller, but most studios found it impossible to adapt to film. Mathis's adaptation so impressed the studio, they asked for her input in director and star. For director, she chose Rex Ingram, who would clash with both her and Valentino.Leider, Emily W., Dark Lover. pp. 111-130. Mathis had seen a young actor named Rudolph Valentino in a bit part of a Clara Kimball Young film, Eyes of Youth, in 1919. Valentino had arrived in Hollywood in 1918, where he had worked in many B movies, including All Night with Carmel Myers and The Delicious Little Devil with Mae Murray.Leider, Emily W., Dark Lover: The Life and Death of Rudolph Valentino, pp. 81-83. He also worked on a picture with Julian Eltinge and Virginia Rappe that would eventually become The Isle of Love. It has been suggested Mathis might have first seen him in that film, as she was a close friend of Eltinge. Mathis insisted Valentino would play Julio; however, studio executives were nervous with the young actor. Valentino, whose parents were French and Italian, had a distinctly Latin look that had not been used much in pictures at that time.Leider, Emily W., Dark Lover. pp. 61-85. However, Mathis got her way, and after seeing the rushes, she and Ingram decided to expand the role of Julio to showcase the talents of Valentino. Valentino had worked as a taxi dancer during his time in New York. To show off his dancing skills, the tango scene was included, though it was not part of the original story. The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse did not glorify war or look past the losses of war, as seen in this film still. Alice Terry was cast as Julio's lover, Marguerite. She would marry Ingram that same year. Metro paid Ibanez $20,000 and 10% of the gross earnings for the rights to adapt his novel.Schulman. 1967. The film took six months to shoot, cost $80,000, and had a cast of 72 \\"principal players\\". Valentino was only paid $350 a week, which was much less than other players. To add to his troubles, he also had to provide his own costumes, which he spent thousands on. The French Marne village was constructed at Griffith Park in Los Angeles, California. In the scenes between Julio and Marguerite, Valentino and Terry spoke French to impress lip readers. Valentino was fluent in French, as his mother was French.Leider, 2004. Mathis also injected some early depictions of alternative lifestyles; it featured a scene with German officers coming down the stairs in drag. Of the scene, Mathis would later tell the Los Angeles Times, \\"I had the German officers coming down the stairs with women's clothing on. To hundreds of people that meant no more than a masquerade party. To those who have lived and read, and who understand life, that scene stood out as one of the most terrific things in the picture.\\" Reception Photoplay's July 1922 issue featured Rudolph Valentino, in the dress of his character Julio Desnoyers, illustrated by Tempest Inman on its cover. The film premiered in New York to great critical acclaim. Many critics hailed it as a new Birth of a Nation. However, the German press was less enthused with the portrayal of Germans in the film. The film became a commercial success as well, and was one of the first films to make $1,000,000 at the box office. The film is considered to be the sixth-best-selling silent film of all time.Biggest Money Pictures. CinemaWeb.com. During its initial run, it grossed $4,500,000 domestically. With its extended scenes of the devastated French countryside and personalized story of loss, The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse is often considered to be one of the first anti-war films made. Some aspects of the film were controversial with American film censorship boards. For example, the Pennsylvania board, upon reviewing the affair between Julio and Marguerite, required that Marguerite be described in intertitles as being the fiancée of Etienne Laurier rather than his wife. Picture-Play Magazine reviewed The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse in their April 1921 issue, saying \\"The Four Horsemen may have been a spectacular and million-dollar flivver. As it is, it is an artistic triumph.\\" They also praised the cast. \\"Rudolph Valentino plays the role of Julio Desnoyers.

Kosen judo's rules allow for greater emphasis of than typically takes place in competitive judo and it is sometimes regarded as a distinct style of judo.Green and Svinth 2003, p282 Currently the term \\"kosen judo\\" is frequently used to refer to the competition ruleset associated with it that allows for extended ne-waza. Such competition rules are still used in the competitions held annually between the seven former Imperial universities. Similarly, there has been a resurgence in interest in Kosen judo in recent years due to its similarities with Brazilian jiu jitsu.  History  Modern kosen training in Japan. Mune Atama Gatame at the Nanatei league in 2010. is an abbreviation of , literally 'higher speciality school', and refers to the colleges of technology in Japan that cater for students from age 15 to 20. The kosen schools started holding judo competitions in 1898,Yaichibei Kanemitsu, Shin Shiki Judo, 1925 four years after their opening, and they hosted an annual event of inter-collegiate competitions called from 1914 to 1944. The rules of a kosen judo match were mainly the ones codified by the Dai Nippon Butokukai and Kodokan school prior to 1925 changes. However, they differed in that they asserted the right of competitors to enter groundwork however they wished and to remain in it as long as they wanted, as well as perform certain techniques which were forbidden in regular competition. Naturally, this kind of rules allowed to discard tachi-waza and adopt a more tactical style of ne- waza, which was developed profusely under the influence of judoka like Tsunetane Oda and Yaichihyōe Kanemitsu. It is believed that the popularity of those strategies was the reason why Kodokan changed its competitive ruleset, restricting ground fighting and entries in 1925 and replacing draws for decision victories or yusei-gachi in 1929. Jigoro Kano was reportedly unsatisfied with kosen rules, and was quoted in 1926 as believing that kosen judo contributed to create judokas more proficient at winning sport matches at the cost of being less skilled at self-defense.Risei Kano, Jigoro Kano and the Kodokan - An Innovative Response To Modernisation Despite his posture, the kosen movement continued on, having barely changed its rules through all its story. In 1950, the kōtō senmon gakkō school system was abolished as a consequence of education reforms, but the kosen ruleset was adopted by the universities of Tokyo, Kyoto, Tohoku, Kyushu, Hokkaido, Osaka and Nagoya, collectively known as Seven Imperial Universities. They hosted the first inter-collegiate competition, , in 1952, giving birth to another annual tradition.Jujutsu & Newaza, Sensei St. Hilaire The Tokyo University abandoned the Nanatei league in 1991 in order to focus on regular judo, but it was reincorporated in 2001.Ryuichiro Matsubara, Nanatei Judo, Gong Kakutogi, 2001 The Kyoto region is particularly notable on the kosen judo scene, having schools entirely specialized on this style until around 1940.Jujutsu & Newaza , Sensei St. Hilaire Among the seven universities, Kyoto has the highest number of victories at the Nanatei league, counting 22 wins and 3 draws (against Nagoya in 1982 and Tohoku in 1982 and 1983) out of the 66 editions celebrated as of 2017.  Ruleset  Competitors at the Nanatei league in 2010. Unlike mainstream Kodokan competition rules, kosen rules allow , enabling competitors to transition to ne-waza by dragging their opponent down without using a recognised nage-waza technique (analogous to pulling- guard).Shichitei Judo shiai rules (unofficial translation) It is also allowed to remain on the ground as much time as it is necessary, regardless of the contenders' activity. The judoka can grab his opponent as he wants, including at the legs and trousers, and there is no restriction on defensive posture. Techniques like neck cranks and leglocks were legal (excluding ashi garami, which was still a forbidden technique or kinshi-waza), though only until 1925. Finally, winning can only be accomplished by ippon, being the only alternative a hikiwake or technical draw at the referee's discretion. The matches are contested on a mat 20×20 meters in total size. A starting zone 8x8 meters was marked on the mat as well as a danger zone which ended at 16×16 meters. If a judoka went out of the danger zone the match would be restarted. If they were actively engaged in newaza the referee would call sono-mama to freeze them into position, drag them to the middle of the competition area, and call yoshi to restart the match in the same situation. This device was common in judo in general and is still part of the official judo rules, addressed in article 18, but has since fallen into disuse, allowing modern judoka to escape newaza by going out of the competition zone. At the Nanatei Judo league, universities face off in teams of 20 judoka of any weight class: 13 of ordinary contenders, a captain and a vice-captain, and five replacements in case of injuries or retirements. Every match is composed of a single, six-minute round, changed to an eight minute round when the contenders are captains or vice-captains. The league is hosted as a kachi-nuki shiai, meaning every winner stays on the mat to face the next member of the rival team. At the end of the event, victory is given to the team with the highest numbers of matches won or with the last man on the field.

Biography Born in Montreal, Quebec, Héroux wanted to become a teacher when he collaborated with Denys Arcand and Stéphane Venne on the 1962 film about life as a student, Seul ou avec d’autres. That year he went on to become a teacher and for the next six years, in addition to teaching, he also wrote two history books and continued to direct. By the late 1960s Héroux had become one of the most successful independent filmmakers with hits like 1968's Valérie and Here and Now (L'Initiation) in 1970. In 1975, riding the success of several other popular features he directed, such as the swashbuckler Quelques arpents de neige (1973), he became involved in co- production projects and big-budget Quebec features. He went on to helm international co-productions with films such as Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris (1975), Atlantic City (1980), and Quest for Fire (1981). He was a co-founder of Alliance Films a company he left in the late eighties. Héroux won a Best Picture Genie for producing The Plouffe Family (Les Plouffe) in 1981 and The Bay Boy in 1985. He also received an Oscar nomination for Best Picture for Atlantic City. Héroux was a member of the jury at the 31st Berlin International Film Festival in 1981. In 1983, Héroux was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. He is the older brother of prolific Quebec film and television producer Claude Héroux.

Quantum programming languages help express quantum algorithms using high-level constructs.  Quantum instruction sets  Quantum instruction sets are used to turn higher level algorithms into physical instructions that can be executed on quantum processors. Sometimes these instructions are specific to a given hardware platform, e.g. ion traps or superconducting qubits. = cQASM = cQASM, also known as common QASM, is a hardware-agnostic QASM which guarantees the interoperability between all the quantum compilation and simulation tools. It was introduced by the QCA Lab at TUDelft. = Quil = Quil is an instruction set architecture for quantum computing that first introduced a shared quantum/classical memory model. It was introduced by Robert Smith, Michael Curtis, and William Zeng in A Practical Quantum Instruction Set Architecture. Many quantum algorithms (including quantum teleportation, quantum error correction, simulation, and optimization algorithms) require a shared memory architecture. = OpenQASM = OpenQASM is the intermediate representation introduced by IBM for use with Qiskit and the IBM Q Experience. = Blackbird = Blackbird is a quantum instruction set and intermediate representation used by Xanadu and Strawberry Fields. It is designed to represent continuous-variable quantum programs that can run on photonic quantum hardware.  Quantum software development kits  Quantum software development kits provide collections of tools to create and manipulate quantum programs. They also provide the means to simulate the quantum programs or prepare them to be run using cloud-based quantum devices. = SDKs with access to quantum processors = The following software development kits can be used to run quantum circuits on prototype quantum devices, as well as on simulators. Ocean An Open Source suite of tools developed by D-Wave. Written mostly in the Python programming language, it enables users to formulate problems in Ising Model and Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization formats (QUBO). Results can be obtained by submitting to an online quantum computer in Leap, D-Wave's real-time Quantum Application Environment, customer-owned machines, or classical samplers. A sample code using projectq with Python  ProjectQ  An Open Source project developed at the Institute for Theoretical Physics at ETH, which uses the Python programming language to create and manipulate quantum circuits. Results are obtained either using a simulator, or by sending jobs to IBM quantum devices.  Qiskit  An Open Source project developed by IBM. Quantum circuits are created and manipulated using Python, Swift or Java. Results are obtained either using simulators that run on the user's own device, simulators provided by IBM or prototype quantum devices provided by IBM. As well as the ability to create programs using basic quantum operations, higher level algorithms are available within the Qiskit Aqua package. Qiskit is based on the OpenQASM standard for representing quantum circuits, and will support pulse level control of quantum systems as specified by the OpenPulse standard.  Forest  An Open Source project developed by Rigetti, which uses the Python programming language to create and manipulate quantum circuits. Results are obtained either using simulators or prototype quantum devices provided by Rigetti. As well as the ability to create programs using basic quantum operations, higher level algorithms are available within the Grove package. Forest is based on the Quil instruction set.  tket>  A quantum programming environment and optimizing compiler developed by Cambridge Quantum Computing that targets simulators and several quantum hardware back-ends, released in December 2018. = SDKs based on simulators = Public access to quantum devices is currently planned for the following SDKs, but not yet implemented.  Quantum Development Kit  A project developed by Microsoft as part of the .NET Framework. Quantum programs can be written and run within Visual Studio and VSCode.  Cirq  An Open Source project developed by Google, which uses the Python programming language to create and manipulate quantum circuits. Results are obtained using simulators that run on the user's own device.  Strawberry Fields  An open-source Python library developed by Xanadu for designing, simulating, and optimizing continuous variable (CV) quantum optical circuits. Three simulators are provided - one in the Fock basis, one using the Gaussian formulation of quantum optics, and one using the TensorFlow machine learning library.  Quantum programming languages  There are two main groups of quantum programming languages: imperative quantum programming languages and functional quantum programming languages. = Imperative languages = The most prominent representatives of the imperative languages are QCL, LanQ and QSI>.  QCL  Quantum Computation Language (QCL) is one of the first implemented quantum programming languages. The most important feature of QCL is the support for user-defined operators and functions. Its syntax resembles the syntax of the C programming language and its classical data types are similar to primitive data types in C. One can combine classical code and quantum code in the same program.  Quantum pseudocode  Quantum pseudocode proposed by E. Knill is the first formalized language for description of quantum algorithms. It was introduced and, moreover, was tightly connected with a model of quantum machine called Quantum Random Access Machine (QRAM).  Q#  A language developed by Microsoft to be used with the Quantum Development Kit. QSI> QSI> is a platform embedded in .Net language supporting quantum programming in a quantum extension of while-language. This platform includes a compiler of the quantum while-language and a chain of tools for the simulation of quantum computation, optimisation of quantum circuits, termination analysis of quantum programs, and verification of quantum programs.  Q language  Q Language is the second implemented imperative quantum programming language. Q Language was implemented as an extension of C++ programming language. It provides classes for basic quantum operations like QHadamard, QFourier, QNot, and QSwap, which are derived from the base class Qop. New operators can be defined using C++ class mechanism. Quantum memory is represented by class Qreg. Qreg x1; // 1-qubit quantum register with initial value 0 Qreg x2(2,0); // 2-qubit quantum register with initial value 0 The computation process is executed using a provided simulator. Noisy environments can be simulated using parameters of the simulator.  qGCL  Quantum Guarded Command Language (qGCL) was defined by P. Zuliani in his PhD thesis. It is based on Guarded Command Language created by Edsger Dijkstra. It can be described as a language of quantum programs specification.  QMASM  Quantum Macro Assembler (QMASM) is a low-level language specific to quantum annealers such as the D-Wave.Scott Pakin, \\"A Quantum Macro Assembler\\", Proceedings of the 20th Annual IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference 2016  Scaffold  Scaffold is C-like language, that compiles to QASM and OpenQASM. It is built on top of the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure to perform optimizations on Scaffold code before generating a specified instruction set.  Silq  Silq is a high-level programming language for quantum computing with a strong static type system, developed at ETH Zürich. = Functional languages = Efforts are underway to develop functional programming languages for quantum computing. Functional programming languages are well-suited for reasoning about programs. Examples include Selinger's QPL,Peter Selinger, \\"Towards a quantum programming language\\", Mathematical Structures in Computer Science 14(4):527-586, 2004. and the Haskell-like language QML by Altenkirch and Grattage.Jonathan Grattage: QML Research (website)T. Altenkirch, V. Belavkin, J. Grattage, A. Green, A. Sabry, J. K. Vizzotto, QML: A Functional Quantum Programming Language (website) Higher-order quantum programming languages, based on lambda calculus, have been proposed by van Tonder,Andre van Tonder, \\"A Lambda Calculus for Quantum Computation\\", SIAM J. Comput., 33(5), 1109–1135. (27 pages), 2004. Also available from arXiv:quant-ph/0307150 Selinger and ValironPeter Selinger and Benoît Valiron, \\"A lambda calculus for quantum computation with classical control\\", Mathematical Structures in Computer Science 16(3):527-552, 2006. and by Arrighi and Dowek.Pablo Arrighi, Gilles Dowek, \\"Linear-algebraic lambda- calculus: higher-order, encodings and confluence\\", 2006  QFC and QPL  QFC and QPL are two closely related quantum programming languages defined by Peter Selinger. They differ only in their syntax: QFC uses a flow chart syntax, whereas QPL uses a textual syntax. These languages have classical control flow but can operate on quantum or classical data. Selinger gives a denotational semantics for these languages in a category of superoperators.  QML  QML is a Haskell-like quantum programming language by Altenkirch and Grattage. Unlike Selinger's QPL, this language takes duplication, rather than discarding, of quantum information as a primitive operation. Duplication in this context is understood to be the operation that maps \\\\phi\\\\rangle to \\\\phi\\\\rangle\\\\otimes\\\\phi\\\\rangle, and is not to be confused with the impossible operation of cloning; the authors claim it is akin to how sharing is modeled in classical languages. QML also introduces both classical and quantum control operators, whereas most other languages rely on classical control. An operational semantics for QML is given in terms of quantum circuits, while a denotational semantics is presented in terms of superoperators, and these are shown to agree. Both the operational and denotational semantics have been implemented (classically) in Haskell.Jonathan Grattage, QML: A Functional Quantum Programming Language (compiler) , 2005–2008  LIQUi>  LIQUi> (pronounced liquid) is a quantum simulation extension on the F# programming language. It is currently being developed by the Quantum Architectures and Computation Group (QuArC)Quantum Architectures and Computation Group (QuArC), https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/quantum-architectures-and- computation-group-quarc/, 2011 part of the StationQ efforts at Microsoft Research. LIQUi> seeks to allow theorists to experiment with quantum algorithm design before physical quantum computers are available for use. It includes a programming language, optimization and scheduling algorithms, and quantum simulators. LIQUi> can be used to translate a quantum algorithm written in the form of a high-level program into the low-level machine instructions for a quantum device.  Quantum lambda calculi  Quantum lambda calculi are extensions of the classical lambda calculus introduced by Alonzo Church and Stephen Cole Kleene in the 1930s. The purpose of quantum lambda calculi is to extend quantum programming languages with a theory of higher-order functions. The first attempt to define a quantum lambda calculus was made by Philip Maymin in 1996.Philip Maymin, \\"Extending the Lambda Calculus to Express Randomized and Quantumized Algorithms\\", 1996 His lambda-q calculus is powerful enough to express any quantum computation. However, this language can efficiently solve NP-complete problems, and therefore appears to be strictly stronger than the standard quantum computational models (such as the quantum Turing machine or the quantum circuit model). Therefore, Maymin's lambda-q calculus is probably not implementable on a physical device . In 2003, André van Tonder defined an extension of the lambda calculus suitable for proving correctness of quantum programs. He also provided an implementation in the Scheme programming language. In 2004, Selinger and Valiron defined a strongly typed lambda calculus for quantum computation with a type system based on linear logic.Peter Selinger, Benoˆıt Valiron, \\"Quantum Lambda Calculus\\"  Quipper  Quipper was published in 2013. It is implemented as an embedded language, using Haskell as the host language. For this reason, quantum programs written in Quipper are written in Haskell using provided libraries. For example, the following code implements preparation of a superposition import Quipper spos :: Bool -> Circ Qubit spos b = do q <\\\\- qinit b r <\\\\- hadamard q return r  References   Further reading  *  External links  * Bibliography on Quantum Programming Languages (updated in May 2007) * 5th International Workshop on Quantum Physics and Logic * 4th International Workshop on Quantum Programming Languages * 3rd International Workshop on Quantum Programming Languages * 2nd International Workshop on Quantum Programming Languages * Quantum programming language in Quantiki * QMASM documentation *pyQuil documentation including Introduction to Quantum Computing * Scaffold Source * Curated list of all open-source quantum software projects Category:Programming language classification Category:Programming paradigms Category:Quantum computing Category:Quantum information science ","title":"Quantum programming"},{"id":"2137653","text":"Lunar Orbiter 5 image Kuo Shou Ching is a small lunar impact crater that is located in the northwestern part of the walled plain Hertzsprung, on the far side of the Moon.

It has gained notoritey as being one of the albums released by Sony BMG in the mid-2000s containing their controversial Extended Copy Protection software package, that resulted in lawsuits and settlements to consumers. Background Acceptance formed in Seattle Washington, in 1998, with a line-up of: vocalist/bassit Jason Vena, guitarist Kaylan Cloyd, guitarist Chris DeCastro and drummer Peter Pizzuto. The group released a self-produced EP, titled Lost for Words , in late 2000 through independent label Rocketstar Records. Sometime after this, Pizzuto and DeCastro departed from the group; the pair were replaced by Garrett Lunceford and Christian McAlhaney, respectively. Ryan Zwiefelhofer then joined on bass. The group then recorded another EP, this time with Aaron Sprinkle. This brought the band to the attention of Columbia Records president Rick Rubin and A&R; representative Matt Pinfield. The band wished to release it through an independent label in order to build a fan base and tour for a period of time, before creating an album for Columbia. Columbia thought this was a good idea, and as a result, the Black Lines to Battlefields EP was released in 2003 through The Militia Group. Shortly afterwards, Lunceford left the group. Composition and recording The album's sound has been described as alternative pop, pop, pop rock,http://www.altpress.com/features/entry/19_albums_we_cant_believe_turn_10_this_yearhttp://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7701823/acceptance- colliding-by-design-stream-interview-new-album and rock. All of the songs on the album were written, but were left unfinished before recording. Prior to entering the studio, the group did pre-production for a few months. By the time they entered the studio, the band had complete songs. Phantoms was recorded at The Compound in Capitol Hill, Seattle with Sprinkle handling production duties. Release On February 24, 2005, Phantoms was announced for release, and the album's track listing was revealed. On March 1, 2005, \\"Different\\" was released as a single. In March and April, the band went on tour with Copeland, Lovedrug, As Tall as Lions and Eager Seas. On April 23, the music video for \\"Different\\" was released through AOL. Phantoms was released through Columbia on April 26. The band supported Anberlin and Saosin on their tour of the US in June and July. The band took Midtown's place on Warped Tour in mid-August due to them working in a studio. \\"Take Cover\\" was released to radio on September 13. The band supported Yellowcard on their club tour of the US in November. On January 31, 2006, it was announced that bassist Ryan Zwiefelhofer had left the band, citing that he needed to \\"find the place that defines who I am.\\" The group's touring keyboardist Kyle Flynn filled in on bass duties. In February and March, the group went on the Truckstops and Statelines tour, alongside The Academy Is..., Panic! at the Disco, and Hellogoodbye. On August 2, the band announced they were breaking up. With the exception of Vena, the members formed new bands. Reception Phantoms was met with limited critical acclaim. AbsolutePunk wrote: \\"It’s not often that bands can create pop-oriented music that has lasting value, but Acceptance has managed to do it with Phantoms. Outstanding vocals and truly talented songwriting sets this band apart from everybody else.\\" In 2016, Johnny Loftus from AllMusic revisited Phantoms and doubled his initial review score from two out of five stars to four out of five stars, saying that \\"Phantoms is slick and melodic, drawing its tension from the careful multi-tracking of Jason Vena's vocals and layers of guitars,\\" but leaving the review textually unchanged. By March 2006, the album had sold over 75,000 copies. In the years following its release, Phantoms became a cult classic. As of February 2017, Phantoms had sold 112,000 copies in the United States.

Biography  Jacques Hétu was born in Trois-Rivières, Quebec; he began his professional training at the University of Ottawa where he was a pupil of Jules Martel from 1955 to 1956. In 1956 he entered the Conservatoire de musique du Québec à Montréal and studied there for five years with Melvin Berman (oboe), Isabelle Delorme (harmony), Jean Papineau-Couture (fugue), Clermont Pépin (composition and counterpoint), and Georges Savaria (piano); he also studied at the Tanglewood Music Center during the summer of 1959 with Lukas Foss. In 1961 he won several important awards, including the first prize at the Quebec Music Festivals composition competition, a grant from the Canada Council, and the Prix d'Europe. The latter two awards enabled him to pursue studies in France at the École Normale de Musique de Paris from 1961 to 1963 with Henri Dutilleux and at the Paris Conservatory with Olivier Messiaen in 1962–1963. Hétu joined the music faculty at Laval University in 1963, remaining there through 1977. He taught music composition at the University of Montreal in 1972–1973 and 1978–1979. From 1979 to 2000, he was a professor at the Université du Québec à Montréal, notably serving as the director of that school's Music Department from 1980 to 1982 and from 1986 to 1988. Honours He was nominated for a 1989 Juno Award in the Best Classical Composition category. In 1989, he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and in 2001 he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.Jacques Hétu at Encyclopedia of Music in Canada Death Hétu died of lung cancer at his home in Saint-Hippolyte on February 9, 2010. He is survived by his wife, Jeanne Desaulniers, and five children. On March 3, 2010 the Toronto Symphony Orchestra premiered his Fifth Symphony under the baton of TSO music director Peter Oundjian. It is not known whether this commission – his Op. 81 – was his last completed work.

ARP adds another function: detection of an impending rollover. Excessive lateral force, generated by excessive speed in a turn, may result in a rollover. ARP automatically responds whenever it detects a potential rollover. ARP rapidly applies the brakes with a high burst of pressure to the appropriate wheels and sometimes decreases the engine torque to interrupt the rollover before it occurs.

To counteract this, rollover stability systems have begun to incorporate an active suspension system in rollover protection. To accomplish this, the onboard computer uses data from the inertial measurement unit (IMU) to determine when a vehicle is in a rollover condition independent of yaw rate and vehicle speed. When the computer determines that the vehicle is at risk of rollover, it calculates the direction of roll and activates the active suspension system. The force produced in the suspension creates a moment (torque) opposite to that created by the lateral force, and keeps the vehicle safe. Other uses The phrase is also used for active roll over bars for convertible cars, such as the Volkswagen Beetle, which can detect potential roll-over situations and automatically raises rollover bars hidden in the rear head restraints in a fraction of a second.

Since retiring, he has operated the World Xtreme Wrestling promotion and trained wrestlers at the Wild Samoan Training Center.  Early life  Anoa'i was born on the island of Western Samoa, a trust territory that was then administered by New Zealand, and his family relocated to San Francisco, California in the United States when he was young. At the age of 17, Anoa'i enlisted in the United States Naval Sea Cadet Corps.  Professional wrestling career  Upon leaving the Naval Sea Cadet Corps, Anoa'i began training as a wrestler under family friends Rocky Johnson and Peter Maivia. He later received supplementary training from Kurt Von Steiger. He wrestled his first match in 1971 in Phoenix, Arizona. He then trained his brother Sika, and the siblings formed a tag team known best as The Wild Samoans. Throughout the 1970s, The Wild Samoans wrestled for the Canadian Stampede Wrestling promotion (where they received further training from Stu Hart) and for numerous National Wrestling Alliance affiliates. In 1978, The Wild Samoans traveled to Japan to wrestle for the International Wrestling Alliance, winning the IWA Tag Team Championship. =World Wrestling Federation (1979–1980, 1983–1984, 1992–1995)= In 1979, The Wild Samoans joined the World Wrestling Federation, where they were managed by Lou Albano and referred to as \\"Albano's Wildmen\\". The \\"wild\\" nature of the brothers was conveyed through their unorthodox behavior (which included communicating only in unintelligible grunts and consuming unprepared raw fish, during interviews and while approaching the ring). While in the WWF, The Wild Samoans won the WWF World Tag Team Championship. Both members also challenged Bob Backlund for the WWF Heavyweight Championship on several occasions. They left the promotion in 1980. The Wild Samoans then wrestled in Mid-South Wrestling and Jim Crockett Promotions, before returning to the WWF (renamed from WWWF in 1979) in 1983 and regaining the WWF World Tag Team Championship. After Sika suffered an injury, the tag team was supplemented by Afa's son Samu (the relationship was not acknowledged on TV). The trio remained in the WWF until 1984. According to Afa, he lost his job because a few days earlier, Afa didn't come to work because he was at the birth of his son. Afa Anoa'i returned to the WWF for a third time in 1992, as the manager and occasional tag partner of The Headshrinkers (Samu and Anoai's nephew, Fatu). He wrestled his final match on May 22, 1994, teaming with The Headshrinkers to defeat The Quebecers and Johnny Polo at the Rosemont Horizon.Afa's match history, from WrestlingData.com Anoa'i left the WWF in mid-1995. =Late career= After leaving the WWF, he began training wrestlers at his Wild Samoan Training Facility, along with Sika.

The reaction was discovered by Ihsan Ullah Khand (1935-1980), who was working as a postdoctoral associate with Peter Ludwig Pauson (1925-2013) at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow. This reaction was originally mediated by stoichiometric amounts of dicobalt octacarbonyl, but newer versions are both more efficient and catalytic. PK reaction With unsymmetrical alkenes or alkynes, regioselectivity can be problematic, but less so with intramolecular reactions. PK reaction example The reaction works with both terminal and internal alkynes although internal alkynes tend to give lower yields. The order of reactivity for the alkene is strained cyclic alkene > terminal alkene > disubstituted alkene > trisubstituted alkene. Unsuitable alkenes are tetrasubstituted alkenes and alkenes with strongly electron withdrawing groups.Strategic applications of named reactions in organic synthesis: background and details mechanisms 2007 László Kürti,Barbara Czakó Takayama and co-workers used an intramolecular Pauson–Khand reaction to cyclise an enyne containing a tert-butyldiphenylsilyl (TBDPS) protected primary alcohol.

It has been a popular tourist resort since Roman times, with the longest unbroken stretch of beach on the Amalfi coastline.  History  The origins of the town are unclear, though it was likely founded by the Etruscans. It was conquered by the Romans in the 3rd century BC, and was called town was Rheginna Maior, in contrast to the neighbouring town, Minori, Rheginna Minor. All places along the coast were formed by alternating conquerors - such as the Etruscans or the Romans. thumb Between 830 and 840, the towns of the coast between Lettere and Tramonti and Cetara and Positano, including the island of Capri, united to form a confederation of states later known as the Duchy of Amalfi. Each city retained its own name and administrative autonomy, but had a specific role in this federation. Maiori was the seat of the duchy's admiralty, the customs, the salt market and several arsenals.

In 1126, Ramla became part of the County of Jaffa, and a separate lordship was created after the revolt of Count Hugh II in 1134, with Baldwin II as lord (although Baldwin I was not a lord in his own right).

Along with most of the rest of the kingdom, Ramla was recaptured by Saladin in 1187.

It is a sender device used for reading the speed of a vehicle's wheel rotation. It usually consists of a toothed ring and pickup.  Automotive Wheel Speed Sensors  = Purpose = The wheel speed sensor was initially used to replace the mechanical linkage from the wheels to the speedometer, eliminating cable breakage and simplifying the gauge construction by eliminating moving parts. These sensors also produce data that allows automated driving aids like ABS to function. = Construction = The most common wheel speed sensor system consists of a ferromagnetic toothed reluctor ring (tone wheel) and a sensor (which can be passive or active). The tone wheel is typically made of steel and may be an open-air design, or sealed (as in the case of unitized bearing assemblies). The number of teeth is chosen as a trade-off between low- speed sensing/accuracy and high-speed sensing/cost. Greater numbers of teeth will require more machining operations and (in the case of passive sensors) produce a higher frequency output signal which may not be as easily interpreted at the receiving end, but give a better resolution and higher signal update rate. In more advanced systems, the teeth can be asymmetrically shaped to allow the sensor to distinguish between forward and reverse rotation of the wheel. A passive sensor typically consists of a ferromagnetic rod which is oriented to project radially from the tone wheel with a permanent magnet at the opposite end. The rod is wound with fine wire which experiences an induced alternating voltage as the tone wheel rotates, as the teeth interfere with the magnetic field. Passive sensors output a sinusoidal signal which grows in magnitude and frequency with wheel speed. A variation of the passive sensor does not have a magnet backing it, but rather a tone wheel which consists of alternating magnetic poles produce the alternating voltage. The output of this sensor tends to resemble a square wave, rather than a sinusoid, but still increases in magnitude as wheels speed increases. An active sensor is a passive sensor with signal conditioning circuitry built into the device. This signal conditioning may be amplifying the signal's magnitude; changing the signal's form to PWM, square wave, or others; or encoding the value into a communication protocol (such as CAN) before transmission. = Variations = The vehicle speed sensor (VSS) may be, but is not always, a true wheel speed sensor. For example, in the Ford AOD transmission, the VSS is mounted to the tailshaft extension housing and is a self-contained tone ring and sensor. Though this does not give wheel speed (as each wheel in an axle with a differential is able to turn at differing speeds, and neither is solely dependent on the driveshaft for its final speed), under typical driving conditions this is close enough to provide the speedometer signal, and was used for the rear wheel ABS systems on 1987 and newer Ford F-Series, the first pickups with ABS.  Special purpose speed sensors  =Road vehicles= Wheel speed sensors are in anti-lock braking systems = Rotary speed sensors for rail vehicles = Many of the subsystems in a rail vehicle, such as a locomotive or multiple unit, depend on a reliable and precise rotary speed signal, in some cases as a measure of the speed or changes in the speed. This applies in particular to traction control, but also to wheel slide protection, registration, train control, door control and so on. These tasks are performed by a number of rotary speed sensors that may be found in various parts of the vehicle. Speed sensor failures are frequent, and are mainly due to the extremely harsh operating conditions encountered in rail vehicles. The relevant standards specify detailed test criteria, but in practical operation the conditions encountered are often even more extreme (such as shock/vibration and especially electromagnetic compatibility (EMC)). = Rotary speed sensors for motors = Although rail vehicles occasionally do use drives without sensors, most need a rotary speed sensor for their regulator system. The most common type is a two-channel sensor that scans a toothed wheel on the motor shaft or gearbox which may be dedicated to this purpose or may be already present in the drive system. Modern Hall effect sensors of this type make use of the principle of magnetic field modulation and are suitable for ferromagnetic target wheels with a module between m =1 and m = 3.5 (D.P.=25 to D.P.=7). The form of the teeth is of secondary importance; target wheels with involute or rectangular toothing can be scanned. Depending on the diameter and teeth of the wheel it is possible to get between 60 and 300 pulses per revolution, which is sufficient for drives of lower and medium traction performance. This type of sensor normally consists of two hall effect sensors, a rare earth magnet and appropriate evaluation electronics. The field of the magnet is modulated by the passing target teeth. This modulation is registered by the Hall sensors, converted by a comparator stage to a square wave signal and amplified in a driver stage. Unfortunately, the Hall effect varies greatly with temperature. The sensors’ sensitivity and also the signal offset therefore depend not only on the air gap but also on the temperature. This also very much reduces the maximum permissible air gap between the sensor and the target wheel. At room temperature an air gap of 2 to 3 mm can be tolerated without difficulty for a typical target wheel of module m = 2, but in the required temperature range of from −40 °C to 120 °C the maximum gap for effective signal registration drops to 1.3 mm. Smaller pitch target wheels with module m = 1 are often used to get a higher time resolution or to make the construction more compact. In this case the maximum possible air gap is only 0.5 to 0.8 mm. For the design engineer, the visible air gap that the sensor ends up with is primarily the result of the specific machine design, but is subject to whatever constraints are needed to register the rotary speed. If this means that the possible air gap has to lie within a very small range, then this will also restrict the mechanical tolerances of the motor housing and target wheels to prevent signal dropouts during operation. This means that in practice there may be problems, particularly with smaller pitched target wheels of module m = 1 and disadvantageous combinations of tolerances and extreme temperatures. From the point of view of the motor manufacturer, and even more so the operator, it is therefore better to look for speed sensors with a wider range of air gap. The primary signal from a Hall sensor loses amplitude sharply as the air gap increases. For Hall sensor manufacturers this means that they need to provide maximum possible compensation for the Hall signal's physically induced offset drift. The conventional way of doing this is to measure the temperature at the sensor and use this information to compensate the offset, but this fails for two reasons: firstly because the drift does not vary linearly with the temperature, and secondly because not even the sign of the drift is the same for all sensors. Some sensors now offer an integrated signal processor that attempts to correct the offset and amplitude of the Hall sensor signals. This correction enables a larger maximum permissible air gap at the speed sensor. On a module m = 1 target wheel these new sensors can tolerate an air gap of 1.4 mm, which is wider than that for conventional speed sensors on module m = 2 target wheels. On a module m = 2 target wheel the new speed sensors can tolerate gap of as much as 2.2 mm. It has also been possible to markedly increase the signal quality. Both the duty cycle and the phase displacement between the two channels is at least three times as stable in the face of fluctuating air gap and temperature drift. In addition, in spite of the complex electronics it has also been possible to increase the mean time between failures for the new speed sensors by a factor of three to four. So they not only provide more precise signals, their signal availability is also significantly better. An alternative to Hall effect sensors with gears are sensors or encoders which use [magnetoresistance]. Because the target wheel is an active, multipole magnet, air gaps can be even larger, up to 4.0 mm. Because magnetoresistive sensors are angle-sensitive and amplitude-insensitive, signal quality is increased over Hall sensors in fluctuating gap applications. Also the signal quality is much higher, enabling [interpolation] within the sensor/encoder or by an external circuit.  Motor encoders with integrated bearings  There is a limit on the number of pulses achievable by Hall sensors without integrated bearings: with a 300 mm diameter target wheel it is normally not possible to get beyond 300 pulses per revolution. But many locomotives and electric multiple units (EMUs) need higher numbers of pulses for proper operation of the traction converter, for instance when there are tight constraints on the traction regulator at low speeds. Such Hall effect sensor applications may benefit from built-in bearings, which can tolerate an air gap many orders of magnitude smaller because of the greatly reduced play on the actual sensor as opposed to that of the motor bearing. This makes it possible to choose a much smaller pitch for the measuring scale, right down to module m = 0.22. Likewise, the magnetoresistive sensors offer even higher resolution and accuracy than Hall sensors when implemented in motor encoders with integrated bearings. For even greater signal accuracy a precision encoder can be used. The functional principles of the two encoders are similar: a multichannel magneto-resistive sensor scans a target wheel with 256 teeth, generating sine and cosine signals. Arctangent interpolation is used to generate rectangular pulses from the sine/cosine signal periods. The precision encoder also possesses amplitude and offset correction functions. This makes it possible to further improve the signal quality, which greatly improves traction regulation. = Speed sensors on the wheelset =  Bearingless wheelset speed sensors  Bearingless speed sensors may be found in almost every wheelset of a rail vehicle. They are principally used for wheel slide protection and usually supplied by the manufacturer of the wheel slide protection system. These sensors require a sufficiently small air gap and need to be particularly reliable. One special feature of rotary speed sensors that are used for wheel slide protection is their integrated monitoring functions. Two-wire sensors with a current output of 7 mA/14 mA are used to detect broken cables. Other designs provide for an output voltage of around 7 V as soon as the signal frequency drops below 1 Hz. Another method used is to detect a 50 MHz output signal from the sensor when the power supply is periodically modulated at 50 MHz. It is also common for two-channel sensors to have electrically isolated channels. Occasionally it is necessary to take off the wheel slide protection signal at the traction motor, and the output frequency is then often too high for the wheel slide protection electronics. For this application a speed sensor with an integrated frequency divider or encoder can be utilized. Wheelset pulse generator with integrated bearing A rail vehicle, particularly a locomotive, possesses numerous subsystems that require separate, electrically isolated speed signals. There usually are neither enough mounting places nor is there sufficient space where separate pulse generators could be installed. Multi-channel pulse generators that are flange- mounted onto the bearing shells or covers of wheelsets offer a solution. Using a number of bearingless speed sensors would also involve additional cables, which should preferably be avoided for outdoor equipment because they are so susceptible to damage, for instance from flying track ballast. Optical sensor From one to four channels can be implemented, each channel having a photosensor that scans one of at most two signal tracks on a slotted disk. Experience shows that the possible number of channels achievable by this technique is still not enough. A number of subsystems therefore have to make do with looped-through signals from the wheel slide protection electronics and are therefore forced to accept, for instance, the available number of pulses, although a separate speed signal might well have some advantages. The use of optical sensors is widespread in industry. Unfortunately they do have two fundamental weaknesses that have always made it very difficult to get them to function reliably over a number of years, namely – the optical components are extremely susceptible to dirt, and – the light source ages too quickly. Even traces of dirt greatly reduce the amount of light that passes through the lens and can cause signal dropout. These encoders are therefore required to be very well sealed. Further problems are encountered when the pulse generators are used in environments in which the dew point is passed: the lenses fog and the signal is frequently interrupted. The light sources used are light-emitting diodes (LEDs). But LEDs are always subject to aging, which over a few years leads to a noticeably reduced beam. Attempts are made to compensate for this by using special regulators that gradually increase the current through the LED, but unfortunately this further accelerates the aging process. Magnetic sensor The principle used in scanning a ferromagnetic measuring scale magnetically does not exhibit these deficiencies. During many years’ experience of using magnetic encoders there have been occasions when a seal has failed and a pulse generator has been found to be completely covered in a thick layer of brake dust and other dirt, but such pulse generators still functioned perfectly. Historically, magnetic sensor systems cost more than optical systems, but this difference is narrowing rapidly. Magnetic Hall and magnetoresistive sensor systems can be imbedded in plastic or potting material, which increases mechanical reliability and eliminates damage from water and grease. Wheel speed sensors can also include hysteresis. This suppresses any extraneous pulses while the vehicle is at a standstill. Pulse generators constructed in accordance with this principle have been successfully field tested by several rail operators since the beginning of 2005. The type test specified in EN 50155Standard EN 50155. Electronic equipment on rail vehicles. selectron.ch has also been successfully completed, so that these pulse generators can now be delivered.  Wheelset pulse generators with integrated bearings for inside-journal bogies  Inside- journal bogies make particular demands on the pulse generator designer because they have no bearing cover on the end to serve as the basis from which the rotation of the wheelset shaft could be registered. In this case the pulse generator has to be mounted on a shaft stub attached to the wheelset and fitted with a torque converter connected to the bogie frame to prevent it from rotating. The extreme vibration in this location leads to a considerable load on the pulse generator bearing, which, with this method of installation has to carry not only the relatively small mass of the pulse generator shaft but that of the entire pulse generator. When we consider that bearing life reduces with at least the third power of the load we can see that a reliable and durable pulse generator for such a situation cannot merely be adapted from the more common standard pulse generator for outside-journal bogies merely by fitting and intermediate flange or similar construction. It really is necessary to have a pulse generator with a modified design adapted to the requirements of such a location. = Speed sensors for non-magnetic target wheels or applications that produce swarf = Some transport companies are faced with a special problem: the circulating air that keeps the motors cool carries swarf abraded from the wheels and rails. This collects on the heads of magnetic sensors. There are also increasingly motors in which sensors have to scan aluminium target wheels, for instance because the impellers are made of an aluminium alloy and the manufacturer does not wish to have to shrink on a separate ferromagnetic gear rim. For these applications there are speed sensors available that do not require a target magnet. A number of transmitting and receiving coils are used to generate an alternating electric field with a frequency of the order of 1 MHz and the modulation of the coupling between senders and receivers is then evaluated. This sensor is installation and signal compatible to the magnetic sensors; for most common target wheel modules the units can simply be replaced without any other measures being necessary. = Speed sensors with interpolation = Customers often want a higher number of pulses per revolution than can be achieved in the space available and with the smallest module m = 1. To achieve this goal, sensors are available which offer interpolation. These offer output of 2-64X the original number of gear teeth or magnetic poles on the target wheel. Accuracy is dependent on the quality of sensor input: Hall sensors are lower cost, but lower accuracy, magnetoresistive sensors are higher cost, but higher accuracy.

The alternative to connection-oriented transmission is connectionless communication, for example the datagram mode communication used by the IP and UDP protocols, where data may be delivered out of order, since different network packets are routed independently, and may be delivered over different paths. Connection-oriented communication may be a circuit switched connection, or a packet-mode virtual circuit connection. In the latter case, it may use either a transport layer virtual circuit protocol such as the TCP protocol, allowing data to be delivered in order although the lower layer switching is connectionless, or it may be a data link layer or network layer switching mode, where all data packets belonging to the same traffic stream are delivered over the same path, and traffic flows are identified by some connection identifier rather than by complete routing information, allowing fast hardware based switching . Connection-oriented protocol services are often, but not always, reliable network services, that provide acknowledgment after successful delivery, and automatic repeat request functions in case of missing data or detected bit-errors. ATM, Frame Relay and MPLS are examples of a connection-oriented, unreliable protocol. Circuit switching Circuit switched communication, for example the public switched telephone network, ISDN, SONET/SDH and optical mesh networks, are intrinsically connection- oriented communications systems. Circuit mode communication provides guarantees that data will arrive with constant bandwidth and at constant delay and in-order delivery of a bit stream or byte stream is provided. The switches are reconfigured during a circuit establishment phase. Virtual circuit switching Packet switched communication may also be connection-oriented, which is called virtual circuit mode communication. Due to the packet switching, the communication may suffer from variable bit rate and delay, due to varying traffic load and packet queue lengths. Connection-oriented communication are not necessarily reliable protocols. Because they can keep track of a conversation, connection-oriented protocols are sometimes described as stateful. =Transport layer connection mode communication= Connection- oriented transport layer protocols provide connection-oriented communications over connectionless communications systems. A connection-oriented transport layer protocol, such as TCP, may be based on a connectionless network layer protocol (such as IP), but still achieves in-order delivery of a byte-stream, by means of segment sequence numbering on the sender side, packet buffering and data packet reordering on the receiver side. The sequence numbering requires two-way synchronization of segment counters during a three-step connection establishment phase . =Datalink and network layer virtual circuit switching= In a connection-oriented packet switched data link layer or network layer protocol, all data is sent over the same path during a communication session. The protocol identifies traffic flows only by a channel/data stream number, often denoted virtual circuit identifier (VCI), rather than by complete routing information for each packet (source and destination addresses) used in connectionless datagram switching such as conventional IP routers. In connection-oriented communication, routing information may be provided to the network nodes during the connection establishment phase, where the VCI is defined in tables in each node. Thus, the actual packet switching and data transfer can be taken care of by fast hardware, as opposed to slow software based routing. Typically, this connection identifier is a small integer (10 bits for Frame Relay, 24 bits for ATM, for example). This makes network switches substantially faster (as routing tables are just simple look-up tables, and are trivial to implement in hardware). The impact is so great, in fact, that even characteristically connectionless protocols, such as IP traffic, are being tagged with connection-oriented header prefixes (e.g., as with MPLS, or IPv6's built-in Flow ID field ). ATM and Frame Relay, for example, are both examples of a connection-oriented, unreliable data link layer protocols. There are also reliable connectionless protocols as well, such as AX.25 network layer protocol, when it passes data in I-frames. But this combination is rare, and reliable-connectionless is uncommon in modern networks. Connection-oriented protocols handle real-time traffic substantially more efficiently than connectionless protocols, especially with short constant length packets, which is why ATM has yet to be replaced with Ethernet for carrying real-time, isochronous traffic streams, especially in heavily aggregated networks like backbones, where the motto \\"bandwidth is cheap\\" fails to deliver on its promise. Experience has also shown that over-provisioning bandwidth does not resolve all quality of service issues. Hence, (10-)gigabit Ethernet is not expected to replace ATM at this time. Some connection-oriented protocols have been designed or altered to accommodate both connection-oriented and connectionless data.

He was best known as the presenter of Thames Television's children's show Rainbow from 1973 to 1992. Early life and education Hayes had various jobs such as a British Rail booking clerk before attending drama school in Manchester and training as an actor. Hayes' most prominent role was the presenter of Thames Television's children's show Rainbow from 1973 to 1992, replacing original host David Cook. Before this, he worked as an actor, including a recurring role in BBC1's police drama Z-Cars. Hayes also has writing credits for Rainbow and The Great Pony Raid in 1967. Career Hayes struggled to find work after Rainbow was cancelled by ITV when the production company, Thames Television, lost its franchise in 1991. He took a job stacking shelves for his local Sainsbury's grocery for four months as he had not yet found an acting job. He spent time as a taxicab driver and then retired some time later. He stated he would like to have done serious acting work after the show ended, but directors could not disassociate him from his role in Rainbow. Hayes starred in a humorous television advert about investing money, making fun of his fall from the top. Hayes appeared in the video for \\"I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing\\" by Oasis tribute band, No Way Sis. He replicated the role of a taxi driver, just as Patrick Macnee had done in the Oasis video for \\"Don't Look Back in Anger\\". Hayes also appeared in the all-star line up for the video of Tony Christie with Peter Kay's single \\"Is This the Way to Amarillo?\\" In 2002, he was a guest panellist on an episode of Never Mind the Buzzcocks. Hayes was part of the Walkers Crisps campaign for Monster Munch in 2008. The stated objective of the campaign was to find the missing monster puppets from the original 1980s television advertisements for the popular snack. In the film clip, he mentions that he has heard from Bungle recently. In September 2015, he was a guest on BBC One's Pointless Celebrities. He got through to the final but did not get a Pointless answer. Personal life Hayes married Sarah Williams in 1987. The couple had a son, Tom. Hayes was a fan of the Scottish football team Dundee United, having lived in the city in the 1960s. Hayes said that he asked the producers of Rainbow to make the Zippy puppet tangerine in colour, to match Dundee United's colours rather than the blue of local rivals Dundee. He had homes in London and Spain. Death Hayes died of pneumonia in hospital on 30 September 2018 aged 76.

The Xunta has at its disposal a vast bureaucratic organization based at Santiago de Compostela, the galician government capital. The Xunta de Galicia has delegations in the four capital cities of Galicia: A Coruña, Pontevedra, Ourense and Lugo. Legal basis Article 16, Section 2 of the Galician Statute of Autonomy states that History The Xunta de Galicia finds its origins in the Xunta of the Kingdom of Galicia active between 1528 and 1833. The Xunta was Galicia's representation to the central Spanish monarchy. The Xunta was composed by representatives from the cities (dioceses) of Santiago de Compostela, Lugo, Betanzos, A Coruña, Mondoñedo, Ourense and Tui. But at that time the Xunta did not hold real power; it was a consultative body only. During the Peninsular War, started in 1808, the Xunta Suprema de Galicia directed the war against the French invaders and maintained the public order in Galician territory. This Xunta Suprema was in charge of military, legislative issues, and international relations. It was the first time that the Xunta had real autonomy, as the Spanish control weakened. This situation lasted until the French invaders were eventually expelled from the Iberian Peninsula and Ferdinand VII of Spain gradually recovered control over former territories (1813–1814). In 1833 the Xunta was dismantled following the provincial division engaged in Spain by minister Javier de Burgos, under the regency of Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies. In this way, Galicia was separated into four provinces, each one managed by a Provincial Council. Yet, in 1843 the Xunta Central de Galicia was created and presided over by Xosé Maria Suances. In 1846 commander Miguel Solís initiated a military uprising in Lugo. He put an end to the Provincial Councils and created the Xunta Superior do Goberno de Galicia, presided over by Pio Rodríguez Terrazo. This movement attempted to re-unify Galicia and called for Galicia's self-rule. Solís was eventually defeated at the Battle of Cacheiras (23 April 1846) and the so- called Martyrs of Carral were executed on 27 April. Prospects for Galician self-government and possible restoration of a Xunta came close while the Galician Statute of Autonomy of 1936 was being discussed, at the time of the Spanish Second Republic (1931–1939). However, the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939) and subsequent Francoist Spain (1939–1977) halted the process. There was a temporary Galician government in exile, presided by Castelao, although this was not called Xunta but Consello da Galiza (Council of Galicia). The process of devolution initiated by the passing of the Spanish Constitution in 1978 allowed for the establishment of a new Xunta, on 16 March 1978. The Galician Statute of Autonomy (1981), came to ratify the Xunta and Galicia's self-government. Current cabinet The consellerías are the different departments, or ministries, of the Xunta de Galicia. They are the responsibility of the conselleiros (masculine) or conselleiras (feminine). The conselleiros and conselleiras form the actual cabinet of the government, close to the President.

Wrestling career =New Zealand and Australia (1964–68)= After spending his first twenty years in American Samoa, Maivia moved to New Zealand. He began his wrestling career, wrestling not as The High Chief, but as Prince Peter Maivia. Athletic, naturally talented and a quick study, Maivia received his original ring training in New Zealand, under the watchful eye of local wrestler/promoter Steve Rickard. Both in and out of the ring, Rickard taught the young Samoan a great deal about his new profession, and under his guidance, Maivia developed at an amazing rate. On August 3, 1964, after less than a year in the business, the popular rookie sensation stunned New Zealand's wrestling fanbase by toppling the rugged, experienced Rickard to win the prestigious New Zealand Heavyweight title in Auckland. The title victory was impressive, indeed, however Maivia's reign turned out to be extremely short, and he held the coveted New Zealand title for just three days, dropping the championship back to Steve Rickard in Wellington on August 6, 1964. The point had been made though, and from that period forward, Maivia enjoyed main-event status in the NWA's New Zealand territory. Later in 1964, Maivia followed up his previous success by winning another very prestigious championship, the NWA Australasian Heavyweight title. Maivia became the new Australasian champion by defeating Kangaroo Kennedy in Auckland, and he would go on to carry the belt for four consecutive years before finally losing his title to Steve Rickard in 1968. After developing his repertoire and ring skills in New Zealand, Maivia slowly began to branch out and take bookings in other (and often larger) promotions, with success invariably following the popular islander. =World Wide Wrestling Federation= During his stay in the then called World Wide Wrestling Federation, he was one of its most prominent stars, making numerous appearances on Championship Wrestling. He worked matches with many well known wrestlers who would go on to be WWE Hall of Famers, such as Superstar Billy Graham, Ivan Putski and Bob Backlund.

The ship was named after the star Bellatrix in the constellation Orion. The name means \\"warrioress,\\" and the star is usually named as the 22nd brightest star in the northern hemisphere. Bellatrix was constructed in Tampa, Florida as a C2-T class merchant marine cargo ship for the Maritime Commission under the name Raven.

Bellatrix served in the Pacific during 1942, and participated in the Battle of Guadalcanal by delivering troops and supplies to the initial attack on 7 August. She made two subsequent shipments to the island, bringing both cargo and reinforcements. In 1943 she became part of the Mediterranean Theater of Operations, participating in the Allied invasion of Sicily. A subsequent shipment to the Gilbert Islands was terminated due to engine failure; Bellatrix returned to San Francisco for repairs. In 1944, the repaired Bellatrix joined General Holland \\"Howling Mad\\" Smith's amphibious fleet moving to take the island of Saipan. On 16 July, she delivered her cargo, soldiers from the U.S. Army's 27th Infantry Division, just two days before the defeat of the Japanese General, Yoshitsugu Saito. The Battle of Saipan was Bellatrix's last World War II deployment. She was decommissioned in April 1946, and returned to the Maritime Commission three months later. Bellatrix was reacquired by the navy for the Korean War. She was recommissioned 16 May 1952, and performed cargo deliveries and training missions until 1955. Decommissioned a second time, Bellatrix subsequently spent eight years in the Pacific Reserve Fleet before being transferred to Peru in 1963. In 1991 she was sold for scrap, but sank in transit to the port of scrapping. She had been in service for almost fifty years.

Superoxide can be produced in phagosomes which have ingested bacteria and fungi, or it can be produced outside of the cell. Superoxide kills bacteria and fungi by mechanisms that are not yet fully understood. It is presumed that superoxide kills bacteria directly, as the virulence of many pathogens is dramatically attenuated when their superoxide dismutase (SOD) genes are deleted. However, superoxide can also spontaneously form hydrogen peroxide that undergoes further reactions to generate other reactive oxygen species (ROS) like hypochlorous acid (the reactive agent in bleach). It may also inactivate critical metabolic enzymes, initiate lipid peroxidation, damage iron-sulphur clusters, and liberate redox-active iron, which allows the generation of indiscriminate oxidants such as the hydroxyl radical. = Regulation = Careful regulation of NADPH oxidase activity is crucial to maintain a healthy level of ROS in the body. The enzyme is dormant in resting cells but becomes rapidly activated by several stimuli, including bacterial products and cytokines. Vascular NADPH oxidases are regulated by a variety of hormones and factors known to be important players in vascular remodeling and disease. These include thrombin, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), tumor necrosis factor (TNFa), lactosylceramide, interleukin-1, and oxidized LDL. It is also stimulated by agonists and arachidonic acid. Conversely, assembly of the complex can be inhibited by apocynin and diphenylene iodonium. Apocynin decreases influenza-induced lung inflammation in mice in vivo and so may have clinical benefits in the treatment of influenza.  Types  In animals, NADPH oxidase is found in two types: one in white blood cells (neutrophilic) and the other in vascular cells, differing in biochemical structure and functions. Neutrophilic NADPH oxidase produces superoxide almost instantaneously, whereas the vascular enzyme produces superoxide in minutes to hours. Moreover, in white blood cells, superoxide has been found to transfer electrons across the membrane to extracellular oxygen, while in vascular cells, the radical anion appears to be released mainly intracellularly.  Pathology  Superoxides are crucial in killing foreign bacteria in the human body. Consequently, under-activity can lead to an increased susceptibility to organisms such as catalase-positive microbes, and over-activity can lead to oxidative stress and cell damage. Excessive production of ROS in vascular cells causes many forms of cardiovascular disease including hypertension, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke. Atherosclerosis is caused by the accumulation of macrophages containing cholesterol (foam cells) in artery walls (in the intima). ROS produced by NADPH oxidase activate an enzyme that makes the macrophages adhere to the artery wall (by polymerizing actin fibers). This process is counterbalanced by NADPH oxidase inhibitors, and by antioxidants. An imbalance in favor of ROS produces atherosclerosis. In vitro studies have found that the NADPH oxidase inhibitors apocynin and diphenyleneiodonium, along with the antioxidants N-acetyl- cysteine and resveratrol, depolymerized the actin, broke the adhesions, and allowed foam cells to migrate out of the intima. One study suggests a role for NADPH oxidase in ketamine-induced loss of neuronal parvalbumin and GAD67 expression. Similar loss is observed in schizophrenia, and the results may point at the NADPH oxidase as a possible player in the pathophysiology of the disease.Tom Fagan. Does Oxidative Stress Link NMDA and GABA Hypotheses of Schizophrenia? Schizophrenia Research Forum. December 09, 2007. Nitro blue tetrazolium is used in a diagnostic test, in particular, for chronic granulomatous disease, a disease in which there is a defect in NADPH oxidase; therefore, the phagocyte is unable to make the reactive oxygen species or radicals required for bacterial killing, resulting in bacteria thriving within the phagocyte. The higher the blue score the better the cell is at producing reactive oxygen species. It has also been shown that NADPH oxidase plays a role in the mechanism that induces the formation of sFlt-1, a protein that deactivates certain proangiogenic factors that play a role in the development of the placenta, by facilitating the formation of reactive oxygen species, which are suspected intermediaries in sFlt-1 formation. These effects are in part responsible for inducing pre-eclampsia in pregnant women = Mutations = Mutations in the NADPH oxidase subunit genes cause several Chronic Granulomatous Diseases (CGD), characterized by extreme susceptibility to infection. These include: *X-linked chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) *Autosomal recessive cytochrome b-negative CGD *Autosomal recessive cytochrome b-positive CGD type I *Autosomal recessive cytochrome b-positive CGD type II. In these diseases, cells have a low capacity for phagocytosis, and persistent bacterial infections occur. Areas of infected cells are common, granulomas. A similar disorder called neutrophil immunodeficiency syndrome is linked to a mutation in the RAC2, also a part of the complex. =Inhibition= NADPH oxidase can be inhibited by apocynin, nitric oxide (NO), and diphenylene iodonium. Apocynin acts by preventing the assembly of the NADPH oxidase subunits. Apocynin decreases influenza-induced lung inflammation in mice in vivo and so may have clinical benefits in the treatment of influenza. Inhibition of NADPH oxidase by NO blocks the source of oxidative stress in the vasculature. NO donor drugs (nitrovasodilators) have therefore been used for more than a century to treat coronary artery disease, hypertension, and heart failure by preventing excess superoxide from deteriorating healthy vascular cells. More advanced NADPH oxidase inhibitors include GKT-831 (Formerly GKT137831), a dual Inhibitor of isoforms NOX4 and NOX1 which was patented in 2007. The compound was initially developed for Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and obtained orphan drug designation by the FDA and EMA at end of 2010.  Structure  Vascular NAD(P)H generating a superoxide (coloured by subunit).The membrane-bound vascular enzyme is composed of five parts: two cytosolic subunits (p47phox and p67phox), a cytochrome b558 which consists of gp91phox, p22phox and a small G protein Rac. Generation of the superoxide in vascular NADPH occurs by a one-electron reduction of oxygen via the gp91phox subunit, using reduced NADPH as the electron donor. The small G protein carries an essential role in the activation of the oxidase by switching between a GDP-bound (inactive) and GTP-linked (active) forms. =Neutrophilic type= The isoform found in neutrophils is made up of six subunits. These subunits are: * a Rho GTPase, usually Rac1 or Rac2 (Rac stands for Rho-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate) * Five phagocytic oxidase subunits: **gp91phox (NOX2) ** p22phox (CYBA) ** p40phox (NCF4) ** p47phox (NCF1) ** p67phox (NCF2) = Vascular type = There are several vascular isoforms of the complex which use paralogs the NOX2 subunit: *NOX1 *NOX3 *NOX4 *NOX5 = Thyroid type = There are two further paralogs of NOX2 subunit in the thyroid: * DUOX1 * DUOX2 References External links Category:Peripheral membrane proteins ","title":"NADPH oxidase"},{"id":"2137772","text":"Air suspension is a type of vehicle suspension powered by an electric or engine-driven air pump or compressor. This compressor pumps the air into a flexible bellows, usually made from textile-reinforced rubber. Unlike hydropneumatic suspension, which offers many similar features, air suspension does not use pressurized liquid, but pressurized air. The air pressure inflates the bellows, and raises the chassis from the axle. Overview Pneumatic spring on a semitrailer Air suspension is used in place of conventional steel springs in heavy vehicle applications such as buses and trucks, and in some passenger cars. It is widely used on semi trailers and trains (primarily passenger trains). The purpose of air suspension is to provide a smooth, constant ride quality, but in some cases is used for sports suspension. Modern electronically controlled systems in automobiles and light trucks almost always feature self-leveling along with raising and lowering functions. Although traditionally called air bags or air bellows, the correct term is air spring (although these terms are also used to describe just the rubber bellows element with its end plates). History 1909 A.S.L. motorcycle with air suspension On 7 January 1901 the British engineer Archibald Sharp patented a method for making a seal allowing pneumatic or hydraulic apparatus described as a \\"rolling mitten seal\\", and on 11 January 1901 he applied for a patent for the use of the device to provide air suspension on bicycles. Further developments using this 1901 seal followed. A company Air Springs Ltd was formed and in 1909 started producing the A.S.L. motorcycle.The A.S.L. Spring-Frame Motor Bicycle, The Motor Cycle, 7 Jul 1909, p502 This was unusual in having pneumatic suspension at front and rear - rear suspension being unusual in any form of motorcycle at that time. The suspension units were similar to the normal girder forks with the spring replaced by a telescopic air unit which could be pressurised to suit the rider. Production of the motorcycles ceased in 1914. On 22 January 1901 an American, William W. Humphreys, patented an idea - a 'Pneumatic Spring for Vehicles'. The design consisted of a left and right air spring longitudinally channeled nearly the length of the vehicle. The channels were concaved to receive two long pneumatic cushions. Each one was closed at one end and provided with an air valve at the other end. From 1920, Frenchman George Messier provided aftermarket pneumatic suspension systems. His own 1922-1930 Messier automobiles featured a suspension \\"to hold the car aloft on four gas bubbles.\\" During World War II, the U.S. developed the air suspension for heavy aircraft in order to save weight with compact construction. Air systems were also used in heavy trucks and aircraft to attain self-levelling suspension. With adjustable air pressure, the axle height was independent of vehicle load. In 1946, American William Bushnell Stout built a non-production prototype Stout Scarab that featured numerous innovations, including a four-wheel independent air suspension system. In 1950, Air Lift Company patented a rubber air spring that is inserted into a car's factory coil spring. The air spring expanded into the spaces in the coil spring, keeping the factory spring from fully compressing, and the vehicle from sagging. In 1954, Frenchman Paul Magès developed a functioning air/oil hydropneumatic suspension, incorporating the advantages of earlier air suspension concepts, but with hydraulic fluid rather than air under pressure. Citroën replaced the conventional steel springs on the rear axle of their top-of-range model, the Traction Avant 15 Hydraulique. In 1955, the Citroën DS incorporated four wheel hydropneumatic suspension. This combined a very soft, comfortable suspension, with controlled movements, for sharp handling, together with a self-levelling suspension. In 1956 air suspension was used on EMD's experimental Aerotrain. In the U.S., General Motors built on its World War II experience with air suspension for trucks and airplanes. It introduced air suspension as standard equipment on the new 1957 Cadillac Eldorado Brougham. An \\"Air Dome\\" assembly at each wheel included sensors to compensate for uneven road surfaces and to automatically maintain the car's height. For 1958 and 1959, the system continued on the Eldorado Brougham, and was offered as an extra cost option on other Cadillacs. In 1958, Buick introduced an optional \\"Air-Poised Suspension\\" with four cylinders of air (instead of conventional coil springs) for automatic leveling, as well as a \\"Bootstrap\\" control on the dashboard to raise the car for use on steep ramps or rutted country roads, as well as for facilitating tire changes or to clean the whitewall tires. For 1959, Buick offered an optional \\"Air Ride\\" system on all models that combined \\"soft-rate\\" steel coil springs in the front with air springs in the rear. An optional air suspension system was available on the 1958 and 1959 Rambler Ambassadors, as well as on all American Motors \\"Cross Country\\" station wagon models. The \\"Air-Coil Ride\\" utilized an engine-driven compressor, reservoir, air bags within the coil springs, and a ride-height control, but the $99 optional system was not popular among buyers and American Motors (AMC) discontinued it for 1960. Only Cadillac continued to offer air suspension through the 1960 model year, where it was standard equipment on the Eldorado Seville, Biarritz, and Brougham. In 1960, the Borgward P 100 was the first German car with self-levelling air suspension.Der vergessene Meilenstein, Auto Bild (21 July 2010). Retrieved 17 November 2015 (in German). In 1962, the Mercedes-Benz W112 platform featured an air suspension on the 300SE models. The system used a Bosch main valve with two axle valves on the front and one on the rear. These controlled a cone-shaped air spring on each wheel axle. The system maintained a constant ride height utilizing an air reservoir that was filled by a single-cylinder air compressor powered by the engine. In 1964, the Mercedes-Benz 600 used larger air springs and the compressed air system also powered the brake servo. Rolls-Royce incorporated self-levelling suspension on the 1965 Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow, a system built under license from Citroën. In 1975, the Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9 incorporated a hydropneumatic suspension when the patents on the technology had expired. This design replaced the expensive, complex, and problematic compressed air system that was still used on the 600 models until 1984. Air suspension was not included in standard production American-built cars between 1960 and 1983. In 1984, Ford Motor Company incorporated a new design as a feature on the Lincoln Continental Mark VII. In 1986, Toyota Soarer introduced the first electronically controlled (TEMS), a semi-active full air suspension (spring constant, variable attenuation force). Dunlop Systems Coventry UK were also pioneers of Electronically Controlled Air Suspension (ECAS) for off-road vehicles - the term ECAS was successfully trade marked. The system was first fitted to the 93MY Land Rover Range Rover. In 1989, Arnott Air Suspension Products is founded, eventually expanding to a 300,000 square foot manufacturing plant in Merritt Island, Fl., including 65,000 sq. ft Research & Development center dedicated to Air Suspension, assisting in patents for BMW, Mercedes-Benz and more. In 2002 the GMT 360 Trail Blazer SUV featured rear air assist air suspension with Dunlop air springs and an integrated Wabco control system. In 2005 the GM H2 HUMMER featured an optional rear air suspension system with a dual compressor control system from Dunlop to support tire inflation for off-road applications. In 2013, the Tesla Model S began offering height adjustable air suspension. Modern automobiles Vehicles that have used air suspension include models from Maybach, Rolls-Royce, Lexus, Jeep, Ram, Cadillac (GM), Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Land Rover, SsangYong, Audi, Subaru, Volkswagen, Lincoln, Ford, and Tesla, among others. Some Citroën vehicles feature Hydractive suspension, a computer controlled version of their Hydropneumatic system, which features sport and comfort modes, lowers the height of the car at high speeds and continues to maintain ride height when the engine is not running. The air suspension designs from Lincoln, Land Rover, SsangYong, Chrysler, Subaru, Audi, Volkswagen, Tesla, Porsche, and Lexus models feature height adjustable suspension suitable for making it easier to enter the vehicle, clear bumps, or clear rough terrain. The Lincoln Continental, Town Car, Navigator and Mark VIII also featured an air suspension system which offered a controlled but smooth ride. Jaguar and Porsche has taken this to the next level on their XJ and Panamera models, with a system that changes the spring rate and damping settings, among other changes, for their sport/track modes. The Mark VIII suspension settings were also linked to the memory seat system, meaning that the car would automatically adjust the suspension to individual drivers. The control system in the Mark VIII can lower the suspension by about 25 mm (1 inch) at speeds exceeding about 100 km/h (60 mph) for improved aerodynamic performance. One way automakers strive to improve gas mileage is by utilizing active suspension technology. Tesla Motors offers an included \\"Active Air Suspension\\" on the Model S and Model X to lower or raise the vehicle for aerodynamics and increased range. Custom applications camber of rear wheels coupled with 'fitment' of the rim Over the last decade or so air suspension has become popular in the custom automobile culture: street rods, trucks, cars, and even motorcycles may have air springs. They are used in these applications to provide an adjustable suspension which allows vehicles to sit extremely low, yet be able rise to a level high enough to maneuver over obstacles and inconsistencies on paved surfaces. These systems generally employ small, electric or engine-driven air compressors which sometimes fill an on-board air receiver tank which stores compressed air for use in the future without delay. It is important that the tank is sized for the task and can be calculated using a specific formula involving the compressor output, standard atmospheric pressure and compressed pressure. High-pressured industrial gas bottles (such as nitrogen or carbon dioxide tanks used to store shielding gases for welding) are sometimes used in more radical air suspension setups. Either of these reservoir systems may be fully adjustable, being able to adjust each wheel's air pressure individually. This allows the user to tilt the vehicle side-to-side, front-to-back, in some instances \\"hit a 3-wheel\\" (contort the vehicle so one wheel lifts up from the ground) or even \\"hop\\" the entire vehicle into the air. When a pressure reservoir is present, the flow of air or gas is commonly controlled with pneumatic solenoid valves. This allows the user to make adjustments by simply pressing a momentary-contact electric button or switch. The installation and configuration of these systems varies for different makes and models but the underlying principle remains the same. The metal spring (coil or leaf) is removed, and an air bag, also referred to as an air spring, is inserted or fabricated to fit in the place of the factory spring. When air pressure is supplied to the air bag, the suspension can be adjusted either up or down (lifted or lowered). For vehicles with leaf spring suspension such as pickup trucks, the leaf spring is sometimes eliminated and replaced with a multiple- bar linkage. These bars are typically in a trailing arm configuration and the air spring may be situated vertically between a link bar or the axle housing and a point on the vehicle's frame. In other cases, the air bag is situated on the opposite side of the axle from the main link bars on an additional cantilever member. If the main linkage bars are oriented parallel to the longitudinal (driving) axis of the car, the axle housing may be constrained laterally with either a Panhard rod or Watt's linkage. In some cases, two of the link bars may be combined into a triangular shape which effectively constrains the vehicles axle laterally. Often, owners may desire to lower their vehicle to such an extent that they must cut away portions of the frame for more clearance. A reinforcement member commonly referred to as a C-notch is then bolted or welded to the vehicle frame in order to maintain structural integrity. Specifically on pickup trucks, this process is termed \\"notching\\" because a portion (notch) of the cargo bed may also be removed, along with the wheel wells, to provide maximum axle clearance. For some, it is desirable to have the vehicle so low that the frame rests on the ground when the air bags are fully deflated. Owners generally choose between having their cars 'tuck' their wheels into the arches when their air suspension is fully lowered or alternatively they can choose to go for 'fitment' which in partnership with stretched tyres sees the arch itself fit in between the tyre and rim. Air suspension is also a common suspension upgrade for those who tow or haul heavy loads with their pick-up truck, SUV, van or car. Air springs, also called \\"air helper springs,\\" are placed on existing suspension components on the rear or front of the vehicle in order to increase the load capacity. One of the advantages of using air suspension as a load support enhancement is the air springs can be deflated when not towing or hauling and therefore maintaining the factory ride quality. =Electronic Air Suspension= Electronic Controlled Air Suspension (ECAS) is the name of the air suspension system installed on the Range Rover Classic in 1993 and later on the Range Rover P38A. It was developed in the early 1990s by the company now known as Dunlop Systems and Components Ltd in Coventry, UK. ECAS provides variable-height suspension for on- and off-road applications. The five suspension heights typically offered by ECAS are (from lowest to highest in terms of height) \\"Loading,\\" \\"Highway,\\" \\"Standard,\\" \\"Off-Road,\\" and \\"Off-Road Extended.\\" Height is controlled automatically based on speed and undercarriage sensors, but a manual ride height switch allows control over the suspension by the driver. The \\"Loading\\" and \\"Off-Road\\" heights are available only at speeds typically less than . The \\"Highway\\" setting is not available manually; it is set when the vehicle moves at over typically for over 30 seconds. Unlike a mechanical spring system (where deflection is proportional to load), height may be varied independently from the load by altering the pressure in the air springs. The air springs were designed to provide a smooth ride, with the additional ability to raise the body of the vehicle for off-road clearance and lower it for higher-speeds road driving. Mechanical springs, for which deflection is proportional to load, cannot do this; with ECAS height is largely independent of load. The developers of ECAS also designed LoadSafe, a related system to ascertain load and change in load on an LCV type vehicle fitted with air springs. Components The system comprises: * a vulcanised rubber air spring at each wheel * an air compressor, which is typically located in the trunk (boot) or under the bonnet * a compressed air storage tank may be included for rapid \\"kneel\\", storing air at ~150psi (1000 kPa), note (1psi=6.89kPa) * a valve block which routes air from the storage tank to the four air springs via a series of solenoids, valves and many o-rings * an ECAS computer which communicates with the car's main computer the BeCM and decides where to route air pressure * a series of 6 mm air pipes which channel air throughout the system (mainly from the storage tank to the air springs via the valve block) * an air drier canister containing desiccant * height sensors ideally on all 4 vehicle corners based, typically, on resistive contact sensing to give an absolute height reference for each corner of the vehicle. * Dunlop Systems and Components Ltd have continued to develop the products to the point where the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) is now able to fit under the vehicle floor. The control valves are much smaller and lighter and they produce their own range of compressors. Common air suspension problems Cut-way of a deflated commercial truck air spring bellows. 'A' is the rubber bellows element Air bag or air strut failure is usually caused by wet rust, due to old age, or moisture within the air system that damages it from the inside. Air ride suspension parts may fail because rubber dries out. Punctures to the air bag may be caused from debris on the road. With custom applications, improper installation may cause the air bags to rub against the vehicle's frame or other surrounding parts, damaging it. The over-extension of an air spring which is not sufficiently constrained by other suspension components, such as a shock absorber, may also lead to the premature failure of an air spring through the tearing of the flexible layers. Failure of an air spring may also result in complete immobilization of the vehicle, since the vehicle will rub against the ground or be too high to move. However, most modern automotive systems have overcome many of these problems. Air line failure is a failure of the tubing which connects the air bags or struts to the rest of the air system, and is typically DOT-approved nylon air brake line. This usually occurs when the air lines, which must be routed to the air bags through the chassis of the vehicle, rub against a sharp edge of a chassis member or a moving suspension component, causing a hole to form. This mode of failure will typically take some time to occur after the initial installation of the system, as the integrity of a section of air line is compromised to the point of failure due to the rubbing and resultant abrasion of the material. An air line failure may also occur if a piece of road debris hits an air line and punctures or tears it, although this is unlikely to occur in normal road use. It does occur in harsh off-road conditions but it still not common if correctly installed. Air fitting failure usually occurs when they are first fitted or very rarely in use. Cheap low quality components tend to be very unreliable. Air fittings are used to connect components such as bags, valves, and solenoids to the air line that transfers the air. They are screwed into the component and for the most part push-in or push-to-fit DOT line is then inserted into the fitting. Compressor failure is primarily due to leaking air springs or air struts. The compressor will burn out trying to maintain the correct air pressure in a leaking air system. Compressor burnout may also be caused by moisture from within the air system coming into contact with its electronic parts. This is far more likely to occur with low specification compressors with insufficient duty cycle which are often purchased due to low cost. For redundancy in the system two compressors are often a better option. In Dryer failure the dryer, which functions to remove moisture from the air system, eventually becomes saturated and unable to perform that function. This causes moisture to build up in the system and can result in damaged air springs and/or a burned out compressor. =ECAS problems= The ECAS computer can, using pre-programmed criteria to detect a fault, disable the system into \\"Hard Fault Mode\\" which lowers the vehicle to the suspension bump-stops, leaving it usable with radically reduced performance until repaired. Many enthusiasts use diagnostic devices such as laptop and hand computers running specially developed software to clear spurious faults and avoid the need for repair. Some manipulate the sensors to set the vehicle to a particular ride height at all times by adjusting the lever ratio on the height-sensing devices, or a supplementary ECU to \\"fool\\" the system. Leaks in the system, often due to main seal wear caused by excessive duty cycle, can cause premature compressor failure. Use on coaches and buses The current market of buses have suspension system consisting of either mechanical or air suspension system. Compared to its counterpart, air suspension system has significant benefits. Vehicle height can be maintained at a particular value irrespective of its load by varying the pressure. Standard coaches also have a system called ferry lift.http://inform.wabco- auto.com/intl/pdf/815/00/57/8150100573-15.pdf This allows the air suspension to be raised above the normal ride height level to aid loading and unloading the coach on and off ferries due to their steep ramps and risk of grounding out, but can also be used on rough ground or on steep crests. Although the ferry lift may be installed on some buses, the Kneel Down facility is more common on public transport buses. This helps reduce the step height for easy ingress of passengers. The Kneel Down facility is also used when using the built-in wheelchair ramps. Due to several advantages, air suspension has been extensively used in commercial vehicles since 1980.

Pouilly-Fuissé has Chardonnay as the only grape variety. Pouilly-Fuissé is the best-known part of Mâconnais. The AOC was created on 11 September 1936. It was granted premier cru designation in September 2020. There are currently 22 premier cru climats. The area used to be known simply as \\"Pouilly\\", but when the AOC laws were introduced, it was split into three: Pouilly-Fuissé, Pouilly-Loché and Pouilly-Vinzelles. Style Pouilly-Fuissé is a dry white wine made from Chardonnay grapes. It is pale and refreshing, often quite delicate, and often shows a clear oak influence. On average these wines sell for much less than the white wines of Côte de Beaune to the north. Geography West of Mâcon the land rises up to form Mont de Pouilly and other limestone hills, covered in the alkaline clay that best suits Chardonnay. The villages of Vergisson, Solutré-Pouilly, Fuissé and Chaintré shelter at their feet. Production A Pouilly-Fuissé wine In 2008, of vineyard area was in production within the Pouilly-Fuissé AOC, and 39,147 hectoliters of wine were produced,BIVB: Les Appellations d’Origine Contrôlée de Bourgogne, accessed on November 18, 2009 corresponding to 5.2 million bottles of wine. AOC regulations The AOC regulations only allow Chardonnay to be used. The allowed base yield is 50 hectolitre per hectare and the grapes must reach a maturity of at least 11.0 per cent potential alcohol.

The list was called the Prontuario in short and later formed an important part of the Italianization campaign initiated by the fascist regime, as it became the basis for the official place and district names in the Italian-annexed southern part of the County of Tyrol. It has often been criticized by the German-speaking population of the province, on the grounds that the new names often have little perceived historical relevance and that a predominant number have been entirely invented.

In the articles he wrote for The Italian Nation he already used Italianized names, although these early attempts lacked the method and purpose of his later activities. In those days he would use the name Alto Trentino for South Tyrol, not having yet come upon and revived the Napoleonic creation Alto Adige, which would become the official Italian designation for the province after World War I and up to this day.

His work became more systematical with the founding of the Archivio per l' Alto Adige, through which he began to propose Italianized names for villages and geographical features in South Tyrol. In 1916, a year after Italy, instigated by Allied promises and its own nationalist tendencies, entered the First World War, a commission was set up to find Italian names for places in the \\"soon to be conquered territory\\". The commission (composed of Tolomei himself, the Professor of Botany and Chemistry Ettore De Toni as well as the librarian Vittorio Baroncelli) reported almost 12,000 Italian place and district names on the basis of Tolomei's studies. In June 1916, this list was published as Volume XV, Part II of Memorie of the Reale Società Geografica Italiana as well as in the Archivio per l'Alto Adige.Framke 1987, pp. 86-87 Methodology Street sign in Innsbruck, Tyrol, commemorating the city of Bruneck, set up in 1923 in response to the prohibition of the original southern Tyrolean place names. Tolomei explained the methodology for creating Italian names in his introduction to the Prontuario. The main principles are: # Ladin names would be adapted to the current Italian pronunciation; # Pre- existing Italian names: e.g. (Bozen/Bolzano, Meran/Merano) were not changed, though there are exceptions; # Names of pre-Romanic, Rhaetic origin were not changed when adopted by the Romanic population. Germanized Rhaetic names were replaced by the original version or by a historic Latinized form. The same method was applied in the case of names with a Celtic origin; # German names going back to a Romanic form were to be returned to their Latin antecedent; # Irreducibly German names were translated into Italian or substituted with Italian names. This was done by phonetic reduction, where the name was simply Italianized (normally by adding a vowel to the end of the name): e.g. Brenner/Brennero, Moos/Moso. Or by direct translation, e.g. Lago Verde (green lake) for Grünsee; this was a frequent source of mistakes, as Linsberg was translated with Monte Luigi, a name also used as the translation of Luisberg; Blumau was wrongly interpreted as flower valley, and translated to meadow Prato all'Isarco. Alternatively, the name of the patron saint of the town was used, e.g. Innichen/San Candido, or the Italian name was inspired by geographical derivations: e.g. Colle Isarco (Hill-upon-Isarco) for Gossensaß. This methodology was however not applied in a uniform, consistent manner, so that often the choice of name seems to have been arbitrary — thus increasing the perception of imposition. While the aim of Tolomeis toponymy was that of bringing the Latin history back to the surface, more often than not it has been perceived as to bury the Romanic roots of historically grown names even deeper due to the relative linguistic incompetence of Tolomei and his team.Kühebacher 1998, pp. 284–285; Steininger 2003, p. 17. This can be exemplified by the name of the village Lana, which probably goes back to a Roman landholder named Leo, whose territory was called (praedium) Leonianum. In the High Middle Ages the name was pronounced Lounan. In the Bavarian dialect, the vocal ou changed to a in the 12th century, leading to Lanan, which became today's Lana in German. Contrary to his stated methodology Tolomei kept the name Lana, probably because it sounded Italian and in Italian \\"lana\\" means \\"wool\\". The correct Italianization would have been \\"Leoniano\\" (although exact reconstruction may have been abandoned in favor of pragmatism and aesthetics). The same applies to German Trens and Terenten, derived from Latin torrens (stream), which were Italianized as Trens and Terento, not recognizing the Romanic roots still present in the German name.Kühebacher 1998, pp. 286–287. Apart from the frequent mistakes and inconsistencies of Tolomei's toponymy, its main fault is the loss of historical information contained in the historically grown geographical names, an effect which was fully intended by Tolomei. Instead of bringing back Alpine Romanity which spoke a Rhaeto-Romance language, he superimposed the Tuscan dialect, on which Standard Italian is based, on the local Romanic traditions. A case in point is the name Vipiteno, derived from Latin Vipitenum. Tolomei preferred this Latin name to Sterzen, the name commonly used by Italians at that time. In doing so, however, he unwittingly chose a name which had undergone Germanization. The original Alpine-Romanic name would have been Vibidina; the German sound change in the 8th century changed this into Wipitina. As such it was first mentioned in the medieval Latin manuscripts, and in the more recent ones it was further Latinized into Vipitenum, a name which sounded as if it could have been of ancient Roman origin and thus was chosen by Tolomei.Kühebacher 1998, p. 284.

The route is also colloquially referred to as \\"Cap City Freeway\\" and \\"Biz 80\\". The entire route is a freeway. It originally carried mainline I-80 through Sacramento until the early 1980s. The eastern half, originally known as the Elvas Freeway, was initially grandfathered into the Interstate Highway System; however, plans to upgrade or realign this portion to meet Interstate Highway standards were cancelled. As such, the I-80 designation through Sacramento was moved to a northern bypass of the city that had previously been signed I-880, and the former routing was then designated as Business 80. Business 80 then consisted of two connected segments. The western segment ran concurrently signed with U.S. Route 50 (US 50) and also carried the unsigned designation of I-305. The eastern segment was assigned the unsigned designation of State Route 51 (SR 51). After travelers complained that Business 80 was difficult to follow, it was named the Capital City Freeway in 1996. As part of a re-signing project which commenced in 2016, references to Business 80 on the western segment are to be removed, subsequently marking the route as only US 50, but as of 2018 little progress has been made. Route description SR 51 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and both SR 51 and I-305 are part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. Currently, it is the only business route in California to exist as a freeway. =Western section= This portion of Business I-80 follows the routing of unsigned I-305 The western section of Business 80 begins in West Sacramento at I-80, where I-80 leaves the West Sacramento Freeway onto the Beltline Freeway (which travels north of the Bryte neighborhood, over the Sacramento River, and into the Natomas area). This interchange in West Sacramento is also the current west end of US 50 and the west end of the unsigned I-305. In downtown West Sacramento, Business 80 and US 50 split from the West Sacramento Freeway, which is now locally maintained in part over the Tower Bridge up to the door of the capitol, but was once designated as SR 275. Business 80 crosses the Sacramento River on the Pioneer Memorial Bridge, intersecting with I-5 on the eastern bank. SR 99 once ran along I-5 to the north and Business 80 to the east, but this is now signed TO SR 99. After crossing I-5, Business 80 runs on top of an embankment between \\"W\\" and \\"X\\" streets. The W-X Freeway gets its name from running parallel to \\"W\\" and \\"X\\" streets. Beginning in 2016, signs on the western section were being updated to remove references to Business 80 and instead sign the route only as US 50. The eastern section remains signed as Business 80.http://caltrans.ca.gov/hq/esc/oe/project_ads_addenda/03/03-4F7104/plans/03-4f7104_plans.pdf However, most Rand McNally road atlases to this day continue to sign both the eastern and western sections as Business 80. =Eastern section= At an interchange southeast of downtown Sacramento, Business 80 turns north onto the southern end of unsigned SR 51. US 50 continues east, SR 99 heads south, and the unsigned I-305 ends. The elevated freeway carrying Business 80 east of downtown is between 29th and 30th Streets, and an older section beginning at A Street and continuing northeast was originally known as the Elvas Freeway (and originally signed as US 99 east). On this section of freeway, Business 80 crosses the American River before its northeast-bound merge with the North Sacramento Freeway (the northern portion of SR 160 towards downtown). The North Sacramento Freeway, originally a portion of US 40, originally ran west from Marconi Avenue to an intersection with Del Paso Boulevard. The section from Arden Way eastbound back to Marconi Avenue is now part of the currently named Capital City Freeway (while the SR 160 section retains the original freeway name). The original North Sacramento Freeway connected to the Roseville Freeway at the curve north of Marconi Avenue (commonly known as the Marconi Curve, where the freeway once ended at Auburn Boulevard). At the east end of Business 80, the Roseville Freeway continues northeast to Roseville as I-80, while the short unsigned SR 244 heads east to Auburn Boulevard. I-80 heads in both directions around the north side of Sacramento. A partially built portion of a never completed replacement freeway for SR 51, in the median of I-80, now serves as parking and access for the northernmost three stations (Watt/I-80, Watt/I-80 West, and Roseville Road) on the Sacramento Regional Transit District's light rail Blue Line. If this replacement freeway had been completely built as originally planned, I-80 would have continued south following the railroad tracks going through the Ben Ali neighborhood of North Sacramento, crossed over SR 160, and joined with the Elvas Freeway portion just north of A Street. History The State Division of Highways (predecessor to Caltrans) constructed Sacramento’s freeways system incrementally from the 1940s to the 1970s. The plan for the Elvas Freeway was presented in the Sacramento Area Traffic Survey in 1947-1948, and the freeway was built between 1950 and 1955. The Division of Highways built the 2.9-mile Elvas Freeway as a four-lane divided highway (with provisions for a six-lane freeway) to connect with the North Sacramento Freeway in the vicinity of Arden Way. The new freeway’s southern terminus was the surface roads at 29th and 30th streets. At the time the Elvas Freeway was conceived and built, the Division of Highways was already considering an elevated freeway along the 29th Street / 30th Street corridor that would connect with the then proposed South Sacramento Freeway (SR 99). The Division of Highways went on to complete the Fort Sutter Viaduct along the 29th Street / 30th Street corridor in 1968, which led the Division of Highways to convert the Elvas Freeway from four to six lanes in 1965. The Sacramento River Viaduct was completed in 1966, the Southside Park Viaduct was completed in 1967, and the rest of the W-X Freeway was completed in 1968. The Elvas Freeway was connected to the W-X Freeway to the west and US 50 to the east, in 1968 and 1971 respectively. The W-X Freeway and the Elvas Freeway were signed as I-80. Between 1968 and 1975 a 5.2-mile bypass was proposed that was to straighten the alignment of I-80 and increase its capacity. The Sacramento City Council voted in September 1979 to delete the I-80 Bypass freeway from the Interstate System. In 1980 California submitted to AASHTO proposals to relocate I-80 in Sacramento onto then I-880, extend US 50 west to cover the west half of old I-80, and to assign I-305 to the west half of old I-80, and delete I-880 in the Sacramento area (the route would eventually be relocated to then SR 17 from I-280 in San Jose to I-80 in Oakland in 1982-1984). AASHTO approved these proposals. The next year, the California State Legislature extended US 50 west to cover the western half of old I-80, and the eastern half was assigned the new SR 51 number and designated as Business Loop 80.. The signage change from I-880 to I-80, and the previous I-80 to Business 80 was installed in November 1983. The old I-80 was not signed as SR 51, but as a business route. Unlike most business routes in California, which run along locally-maintained streets through a downtown area, Business 80 was not assigned to the pre-freeway alignment of US 40, but to a freeway. The existence of two freeways, both numbered 80, caused some confusion, and in 1996 the full route was given the Capital City Freeway name at the request of the Sacramento Area Council of Governments. This name appears on overhead signs at prominent interchanges. The route is referred to as Business 80, Biz 80, Capital City Freeway, Cap City Freeway, and US 50 (western section only) by residents and mapmakers. Caltrans does not normally use the Business 80 designation, except for signage and other related concepts like Cal-NExUS exit numbers (which are continuous along the business loop). Caltrans refers to the western half as US 50 and the eastern half as SR 51 for traffic condition reporting. Under the California Streets and Highways Code § 351.1, \\"Route 51 shall be signed Interstate Business Loop 80\\". There is no such mandate under § 350 for Route 50, thus Caltrans was able to start removing references to Business 80 on signage in the US 50 segment. Despite Caltrans' official signage and reporting practices, mapmakers may still show the I-305 and SR 51 designations, as well as the Business 80/US 50 concurrency on the western segment. The SR 99 concurrency, running along US 50 and I-5 to northern Sacramento, is also not officially designated by Caltrans, but mapmakers will still also often show it as such. An earlier State Route 51 was defined on July 1, 1964 on a section of pre-1964 Legislative Route 2, providing a loop east of Interstate 5 (pre-1964 Legislative Route 174 there) through Orange, around the Orange Crush Interchange. It was removed from the state highway system in 1965.District VII State Highway Numbering Map, September 20, 1963 Exit list See also *Transportation in the Sacramento metropolitan area References External links * California @ AARoads.com - Business Loop I-80 Sacramento * The Highwayman's Road Reports - Elvas Freeway, North Sacramento Freeway and West Sacramento Freeway 80 Business (Sacramento) 80 Business (Sacramento, California) Category:Transportation in Sacramento, California Business (Sacramento, California) Business Sacramento, California 080 Business Interstate 80 Business Category:U.S. Route 99 Category:Roads in Sacramento County, California Category:U.S. Route 50 ","title":"Interstate 80 Business (Sacramento, California)"},{"id":"2137786","text":"Susan Powers (born 1954 in Glen Cove, New York) is a self-taught American artist.  Education  Powers attended the University of Vermont, where she studied classical languages and medieval history, graduating in 1976 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in European Studies.  Career  Powers began painting in 1979, encouraged by a friend and fellow painter who had seen her expressive pencil drawings. Only a year later, her work had been accepted for display by the prestigious Jay Johnson Folk Heritage Gallery in New York City.

He is best known as one-half of the tag team The Wild Samoans with his brother Afa. Championships held by Anoa'i over the course of his career include the WWF World Tag Team Championship. He was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2007 and the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2012. He is a member of the Anoa'i family and the father of professional wrestlers Rosey and Roman Reigns. Early life Anoa'i was born in the village of Leone on the island of Tutuila in American Samoa on April 5, 1945; one of thirteen children born to Amituana and Tovale Anoa'i. In 1959, at the age of 14, Anoa'i moved with his family to San Francisco, California in the United States. Shortly after the move, Anoa'i enlisted in the United States Merchant Marine, working on ships sailing to the Philippines and Japan. Anoa'i left the Merchant Marine in 1969, working as a stevedore before deciding to become a professional wrestler like his older brother Afa. Professional wrestling career =Early career (1973–1980)= Anoa'i was trained as a wrestler by his brother Afa and Kurt Von Steiger, debuting in 1973 in Stampede Wrestling as \\"Sika\\". Calling themselves \\"The Wild Samoans\\", the brothers and gained notoriety due to their large, wild afros, sarongs, and habit of wrestling barefoot and eating raw fish in the ring. Throughout the 1970s, The Wild Samoans appeared with promotions including Big Time Wrestling, the Continental Wrestling Association, Gulf Coast Championship Wrestling, NWA All-Star Wrestling, NWA Mid-America, Stampede Wrestling, and the World Wrestling Council, winning multiple tag team championships. =World Wrestling Federation (1980)= In January 1980, The Wild Samoans debuted in the World Wrestling Federation with Lou Albano as their manager, quickly establishing themselves as a force in the tag team division through a series of decisive victories. In addition to competing in the tag division, the brothers wrestled as singles, with Anoa'i unsuccessfully challenging Bob Backlund for the WWF Championship in March 1980. On April 12, 1980, The Wild Samoans defeated Ivan Putski and Tito Santana to win the WWF World Tag Team Championship. Their reign lasted until August 9, 1980, when they lost to Backlund and Pedro Morales at Showdown at Shea. As Backlund was the then-WWF Champion, he and Morales were forced to vacate the championship, and The Wild Samoans regained the championship on the September 9, 1980, episode of WWF Championship Wrestling, defeating Tony Garea and Rene Goulet in the finals of a tournament. Their second reign lasted until November 8, 1980, when they lost to Garea and Rick Martel. The Wild Samoans left the WWF in December 1980. =New Japan Pro-Wrestling (1981)= In January to February 1981, The Wild Samoans toured Japan with New Japan Pro-Wrestling, performing as \\"The Samoan #1\\" (Afa) and \\"The Samoan #2\\" (Sika) respectively. They competed in the New Year Golden Series, repeatedly facing Antonio Inoki and Seiji Sakaguchi. The Wild Samoans made a second tour of Japan in November and December 1981, competing in the Madison Square Garden Tag League. =Mid- South Wrestling (1981–1982)= In April 1981, The Wild Samoans debuted in the Oklahoma City, Oklahoma-based promotion Mid-South Wrestling. They were initially managed by Ernie Ladd before betraying him to align themselves with Skandor Akbar. The Wild Samoans held the Mid-South Tag Team Championship on three occasions between June 1981 and May 1982, feuding with Junkyard Dog and his partners. They left the promotion in May 1982. =Georgia Championship Wrestling (1982)= In March 1982, The Wild Samoans began competing for the Atlanta, Georgia-based promotion Georgia Championship Wrestling, where they were managed by Sonny King. In August 1982, they defeated The Fabulous Freebirds to win the NWA National Tag Team Championship. They held the championship for several months, vacating it in December 1982 upon leaving the promotion to return to the WWF. =World Wrestling Federation (1983–1985)= The Wild Samoans returned to the WWF in January 1983, once again adopting Lou Albano as their manager. They won the WWF World Tag Team Championship for a third and final time on March 8, 1983, defeating Chief Jay Strongbow and Jules Strongbow. During their reign, Anoa'i sustained an injury, with his nephew Samu substituting for him in several title defences. The Wild Samoans' reign ended on November 15, 1983, when they lost to Soul Patrol (Rocky Johnson and Tony Atlas) after Albano accidentally hit Afa with a chair. After splitting from Albano, The Wild Samoans challenged Soul Patrol on several occasions but were unable to regain the championship. In April 1984, Anoa'i unsuccessfully challenged Hogan for the WWF Championship in one of Hogan's earliest title defenses. In mid-1984, The Wild Samoans turned face and began a lengthy feud with The North-South Connection (Adrian Adonis and Dick Murdoch). They left the WWF once more in January 1985. =Various promotions (1985-1986)= The Wild Samoans appeared with multiple different promotions in 1985 and 1986, among them the American Wrestling Association, Jim Crockett Promotions, and International Championship Wrestling. =World Wrestling Federation (1986–1988)= With Afa now semi-retired, Anoa'i returned to the WWF in August 1986 as a singles wrestler. Managed by The Wizard, he spent several weeks undefeated before losing to Pedro Morales in November 1986. In March 1987, Anoa'i formed a tag team with Kamala, aligning himself with Kamala's manager, Mr. Fuji, and \\"handler\\", Kim Chee. The duo wrestled a series of matches against The Can-Am Connection and took part in several tournaments. The team was dissolved in August 1987 when Kamala left the WWF. In September 1987, Anoa'i competed in the King of the Ring tournament, losing in the first round to S.D. Jones. On the October 3, 1987 Saturday Night's Main Event XII (recorded September 23, 1987), Anoa'i unsuccessfully challenged WWF Champion Hulk Hogan in the main event. He went on to wrestle a series of matches against Bam Bam Bigelow and then against Jake Roberts. At the Slammy Awards ceremony on December 16, 1987, the \\"Song of the Year\\" category ended with no winner after Anoa'i ate the envelope containing the winner's name. In early 1988, Anoa'i's regular opponents included Lanny Poffo, George Steele, and Hillbilly Jim. On March 27, 1988, he appeared on his first pay-per-view, competing in a battle royal at WrestleMania IV. Anoa'i left the WWF once more following the bout. =Late career (1988)= After leaving the WWF, Anoa'i wrestled a handful of matches on the independent circuit. He formed a short- lived tag team with his nephew Kokina in Continental Wrestling Federation, where they were managed by Alan Martin. He retired later that year. =Retirement (1988–present)= Following his retirement, Anoa'i remained active in wrestling. He trained wrestlers at the Wild Samoan Training Center, a professional wrestling school run by Afa in Minneola, Florida. In 1999, he founded XW 2000, an independent wrestling promotion based in Pensacola, Florida. On March 31, 2007, The Wild Samoans were inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by Sika's son Matt and Afa's son Samu. Personal life Anoa'i is married to Patricia Hooker but they are currently separated. The couple have four children, two boys, Matthew and Leati Joseph, both of whom also became professional wrestlers. Matthew, who was best known for competing for WWE as \\"Rosey\\", died on April 17, 2017. Leati Joseph played college football for Georgia Tech from 2003 to 2006 before beginning a professional wrestling career in 2010, ultimately joining WWE as \\"Roman Reigns\\" and winning the WWE Championship on multiple occasions. .

Capital of the Tâmega Subregion, the population was 72,265 in 2011,Instituto Nacional de Estatística in an area of .  History  The Dolmen of Santa Marta, one of the pre-historic tombs that dot the landscape The region was occupied since pre-history, as evidenced by the proliferation of megalithic monuments, stone settlements and castros. This includes the Menhir of Luzim, a tall stone dating to an occupation of 3–4000 years B.C. Similarly, in the civil parish of Luzim, are the rock engravings that have existed for 3000 years. In addition, there are various rock forts (castros), subject of archaeological studies, such as the archaeological \\"city of the dead\\" in Citânia de Monte Mozinho. One of the largest in the Iberian Peninsula, it was the precursor to the Galician organized community of Cividade Gallaeci; the hill fort is dotted with traces of various cultures: Galician-Lusitanian, Roman, Visigoth and Moorish. There different legends that indicate the origins of the name Penafiel, although the common thread associates it with the many forts situated in the locality. With the consolidation and incorporation into the Roman world, these hill forts were reorganized and moved down from the hilltops, dispersing into concentrated settlements in open areas and encircled by cultivated parcels, such as in Bouça do Ouro (Boelhe). The Roman spa town of São Vicente do Pinheiro was an example of these centres, developing around the natural resources in the region. In addition, vains of gold interspersed in the Schist and Quartzite quarries attracted Roman settlers from the empire, resulting in an intense artesnal economy, supported by the circulation of a single currency, culture and language. In the 9th century, activity became concentrated in the Civitas Anegia on the headwaters of the Tâmega and Douro, that dominated the lands along margins of those rivers. This civitas was the precursor of Penafiel de Canas, an area that assumed an import role, but occupied a smaller area and embryonic place that concentrated on agriculture and fishing. The lands were seats of the Romanesque ecclesiastical seigneurs of the Benedictine monasteries of Paço de Sousa and Bustelo. Supporting a rich cultural influence, Paço de Sousa boasted a magnificent Romanesque architecture and gave shelter to the historian Egas Moniz Ribadouro, schoolmaster of Afonso Henriques. Other noble houses of medieval period include Barbosa de Honor (Rans), with its tower overlooking agricultural lands, or the transformed tower of Coreixas (Irivo). Romanesque religious architecture proliferated during the post-Roman period; the Romanesque temple of Boelhe or Church of São Salvador da Gândara (venerating a deceased saint's skull) attracted pilgrims to the region, as did the Church of Abragão, the late-Gothic Church of São Miguel da Eja and the funerary memorial of Ermida (Irivo). During this time emerged a new reality: a fortified settlement that developed in the parish of Moazares, home of the Romanesque church of Santa Luzia (circled by sculpted tombs) was along the banks of the rive, along the roadway from Porto and crossing the Sousa at the medieval bridge of Cepeda was an ideal local to build an urban community to specialize in services, artesnal commerce and sale of manufactured goods, supported by a medieval fair. The area was known as Arrifana de Sousa. Legend suggests that name came from the name Ariana (the daughter of Hermenegildo González and D. Mumadona Dias) who, following her father's death, inherited the land in the 10th century. At its founding, it was dominated by two castles: one along the northern bank of the Sousa river, called the Castle of Aguiar de Sousa and the second along the southern margin, called Pena. The town was attacked several times by Moors, but, owing to its resistance was referred to in Latin as Pennafidelis, shortened to the Castle of Penafiel. By the 13th century, many of the plots of land were owned by Castile's ex-Queen Mafalda of Portugal. The civil parish of Arrifana de Sousa was established in the sixteenth century. In the same century, in 1519, King Manuel I of Portugal granted the region a foral (charter) that raised the settlement to the status of village. Yet, its change would only occur in the reign of King D. John V (by decree on 7 October 1741). The site was crossed by various roads, where João Correia, a rich Portoense merchant with contracts in Flanders established his home; he was a new Christian, who raised a Manueline chapel to the Holy Spirit (and who erected his bronze funerary tomb). As it grew, Arrifana assumed as patron saint São Martinho (Marin), and in the middle of the 16th century, a new Mannerist temple was constructed over the old chapel of João Correia. The lands continued as an administrative dependency of Porto, until King D. John I conceded it a privilege for supporting his cause. Arrifana de Sousa continued to grow as a centre of services and industry, supported by an annual fair on the feast day of São Martinho, resulting in the expansion of the urban environment to the upper elevations and the construction of the Church of the Misericórdia. Meanwhile, the nobles established their homes outside the town centre, preferring to live in their ancestral estates, established from the land rents and businesses and overseas commerce. By law, during the reign of King Joseph (dated 3 March 1770), the place name was officially changed to Penafiel and the status of city conferred.  Ecclesiastical history  Former cathedral, now Igreja da Misericordia: Our Lady of Mercy On 1 June 1770, by papal bull issued by Pope Clement XIV, the Diocese of Penafiel was established, separating it from the ecclesiastical Diocese of Porto, apparently as suffragan of the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Braga. rather than pastral reasons, the creation of the see was inspired by the wish of king's de facto reigning Prime Minister, the Marquess of Pombal, to punish the Bishopof Porto by depriving him of most of his diocese- the whole comarca di Penafiel (administrative district), comprising 102 parishes, even some in ferguesias (suburbs) of the great (O)Porto port city. The Pope appointed the Carmelite Friar Inácio de São Caetano (born 1718.07.31), confessor of the future Queen Maria I of Portugal (then Princess of Brazil), as its first prelate. But he would never administer the Diocese (as he was in Brazil), and was eventually convinced by the Queen to give-up the bishopric, consoled with a nominal promotion as Titular Archbishop of Thessalonica (1778.12.14 – death 1788.11.29),http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/former/t1377.htm while she successfully requested the Holy See to undo the see creation. On 11 November 1778, Pope Pius VI decided by motu proprio to extinguish the diocese, incorporating its administration (once more) into the mother Diocese of Porto, which it remains part of. The Church of Our Lady of Mercy, which had been bombarded its cathedral, lost that status without being made co-cathedral. = Titular see = The front facade and portico of the Misericórdia In 1969 the diocese was nominally restored as Latin Titular bishopric of Penafiel (Portuguese) / Pintien(sis) (Latin adjective). It has had the following incumbents, mostly of the fitting Episcopal (lowest) rank, with an archiepiscopal exception : * Bernard Theodore Espelage, Friars Minor (O.F.M.) (1969.08.25 – death 1971.02.19) as emeritate, former Bishop of Gallup (USA) (1940.07.20 – retired 1969.08.25) * John Joseph Mulcahy (1974.12.28 – death 1994.04.26) as Auxiliary Bishop of Archdiocese of Boston (Massachusetts, USA) (1974.12.28 – retired 1992.07.21) and emeritate * Francisco-Javier Lozano Sebastián (1994.07.09 – ...) as papal diplomat : Apostolic Nuncio (ambassador) to Tanzania (1994.07.09 – 1999.03.20), Apostolic Nuncio to Democratic Republic of Congo (1999.03.20 – 2001.12.15), Apostolic Nuncio to Croatia (2003.08.04 – 2007.12.10), Apostolic Nuncio to Moldova (2007.12.10 – 2015.12.05), Apostolic Nuncio to Romania (2007.12.10 – 2015.12.05).  Geography  = Physical geography = The municipality extends within an area of , in a confluence of river valleys marked by the Douro, Tâmega and Sousa Rivers, connecting the littoral region and the Transmontana zone. It is a landscape of deep valleys, with intense irrigated zones and pasturelands, with fields encircled by forests of pine and eucalyptus. This inter-fluvial region have granite soils and is rich in water resources, permitting intensive agriculture and extraction industries. The southwest extension of the municipality include a complex of Schist and Greywacke geology, resulting in mountainous, uncultivated and largely forest lands. An intermediary zone, dividing the littoral and mountainous regions, the region was an important transitory point, with lines of communication extending along inter-regional, land and fluvial networks. The first example was the \\"royal roadways\\" that date to the medieval period, that connect Porto and the Trás-os-Montes, that resulted the development of the urban centre, that was a fulcrum in supporting transiting peoples and goods. The Douro was an important link and penetrated the interior, while the flanks of the Alto Douro were used to produce vineyards. The \\"Entre-os-Rios\\" district was also an important part in supporting travel along the interior. A panoramic view of Penafiel in 1930 =Human geography= { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"20\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"float:right;\\"  } With 28 civil parishes it includes a resident population of 72,000 inhabitants (approximately 338.4 people per kilometre square), integrated into the Associação de Municípios do Vale do Sousa (Vale de Sousa Municipal Association)and NUTSIII Tâmega Subregion. The region is settled, but in dispersed enclaves, supported by small industry and commerce, while newer residential homes juxtaposition older rural dwellings. These older homes are usually maintained by part-time farming families and seniors, perpetuated by intense migration and facilitated by their proximity to major roadways. The municipality is administered by the following civil parishes (freguesias): * Abragão * Boelhe * Bustelo * Cabeça Santa * Canelas * Capela * Castelões * Croca * Duas Igrejas * Eja * Fonte Arcada * Galegos * Guilhufe e Urrô * Irivo * Lagares e Figueira * Luzim e Vila Cova * Oldrões * Paço de Sousa * Penafiel * Perozelo * Rans * Rio de Moinhos * Rio Mau * São Mamede de Recezinhos * São Martinho de Recezinhos * Sebolido * Termas de São Vicente * Valpedre The parishes are, largely, semi-industrialized, with a mixture of modern homes and rural dwellings in nature. Villages have houses made with small stones and granite, both of which are common in locality of Penafiel.  Economy  Extraction industries, civil construction firms and commerce employs a large number of workers, in addition to a strong concentration of service sector activities, confirmed by a Penafiel's central place in the regional economy. Penafiel invested in new schools and renovating others during the 20th century, maintaining several kindergartens, primary and secondary schools. The municipal council is responsible for maintaining several health centres, clinics and hospital, with Padre Américo Hospital situated in the parish of Guilhufe. The council has some train stations in their territory of buses throughout the country and a vast road system. = Tourism = Penafiel is the centre for therapeutic treatments and spas, highlighted by the São Vicente Spa and the Inatel Entre-os Rios Spa. The São Vicente is known for the characteristic quality of its waters: the spa is known for the hyper- mineralized waters, that include concentrated sulphurous and carbonaceous akline silicates and fluoridated water. It is considered the most alkaline among the sulphurous waters of Portugal and Europe, with temperatures of about , advocated for the treatment of respiratory diseases and musculo-skeletal system ailments. One of the largest Portuguese is located in Penafiel: Magikland, formerly Bracalândia (and had moved from Braga), where it prospered. Tourism is cyclical in the region, influence by the staggering of religious and secular activities, but marked by special events throughout the year, particularly around the religious feast of São Martinho. This includes the literary festival Escritaria and the agricultural fair Agrival, which had its basis in the traditional medieval fairs.  Historical heritage  A view of the ancient Menhir of Luzim on the archaeological site The rock carvings associated with pre-historic settlements in the 3-4000 B.C. The region of Penafiel is known for a history dating to the pre-historic period, marked by dolmens, petroglyphs, necropoli and fortified settlements constructed of stone. But, over time and through the influence of various cultural groups (Romans, Visigoths, Moors) the area began to evolve into a modern centre, marked by the evolution in its architecture from rudimentary stone dolmens to signeurial manorhouses and monumental estates. = Archaeological = The ruins of the former-fortified settlement of Castro of Monte Mozinho * Castro of Monte Mozinho () * Dolmen of Santa Marta ( * Menhir of Luzim () * Prehistoric Rock-Art Site of Lomar () * Prehistoric Rock-Art Site of Pegadinhas de São Gonçalo () * Prehistoric Rock-Art Site of Tapada das Eiras () * Tomb of Monte de São Roque () = Civic architecture = The turn of the century railway station at Penafiel * Aqueduct of the Monastery of Bustelo () * Asylum of Santo António dos Capuchos () * Bridge Duarte Pacheco () * Bridge of Espindo () * Bridge of Lardosa () * Bridge of Rans ( * Bridge of Santa Marta () * Bridge of Vau () * Estate of Cimo de Vila () * Estate of Abol () * Estate of Aveleda () * Estate of Boveira () * Estate of Casa Nova () * Estate of Companhia () * Estate of Curveira () * Estate of Fentão de Baixo () * Estate of Maragossa () * Estate of Mesão Fria () * Estate of Mogol () * Estate of Pena () * Estate of Perosinho () * Estate of Souto () * Estate of Ventuzela () * Fountain Armoriada () * Hospital Padre Américo Vale do Sousa () * Jailhouse of Penafiel () * Judicial Courts of Penafiel () * Manorhouse and Tower of Honra de Barbosa () * Municipal Palace/Hall of Penafiel () * Palace Hotel of Termas de São Vicente () * Penafiel Railway Station () * Pillory of Honra de Barbosa () * Pillory of Penafiel () * Residence of Cantoneiros () * Residence of Reboleira () * School of Novelas () * Thermal Spa of Quinta da Torre () * Thermal Spa of São Vicente () * Tower of Coreixas () = Religious architecture = The imposing Romanesque facade of the Monastery/Church of Paço de Sousa The facade of the Church of São Gens The Sanctuary of Senhora da Piedade e Santos Passos Monastery of Paços de Sousa * Chapel of the Divino Salvador () * Chapel of Lagares () * Chapel of Menino Jesus () * Chapel of Nossa Senhora da Ajuda () * Chapel of Nossa Senhora da Cividade () * Chapel of Nossa Senhora do Desterro () * Chapel of Nossa Senhora da Lurdes () * Chapel of Nossa Senhora do Monte e São Brás () * Chapel of Nossa Senhora de Paz () * Chapel of Nossa Senhora do Rosário () * Chapel of Nossa Senhora da Saude () * Chapel of the Sagrada Familia () * Chapel of the Santa Casa da Misericórdia () * Chapel of Santa Luzia () * Chapel of Santo António () * Chapel of São Bartolomeu () * Chapel of São Bartolomeu de Louredo () * Chapel of São Domingos () * Chapel of São João Baptista () * Chapel of São Julião () * Chapel of São Lourenço () * Chapel of São Mateus () * Chapel of São Pedro () * Chapel of São Roque () * Chapel of São Sebastião () * Chapel of São Simão () * Chapel of Senhor dos Aflitos () * Chapel of Senhor do Calvário () * Chapel of Senhor do Monte () * Chapel of the Thermals of Quinta da Torre () * Chapel of the Thermals of São Vicente () * Convent of Santo António dos Capuchos () * Chris the King of São Mamede de Recezinhos ( * Church of the Divino Salvador () * Church of Nossa Senhora de Fátima () * Church of Nossa Senhora da Saúde () * Church of Nossa Senhora da Visitação () * Church of Santo Adrião () * Church of Santo André () * Church of Santo Estêvão () * Church of Santa Maria () * Church of Santa Marinha () * Church of Santa Marta () * Church of Santiago () * Church of São João Baptista () * Church of São João Evangelista () * Church of São Mamede () * Church of São Mamede de Recezinhos () * Church of São Martinho () * Church of São Martinho de Recezinhos () * Church of São Martinho de Tours () * Church of São Miguel () * Church of São Paio () * Church of São Paulo () * Church of São Pedro () * Church of São Gens () * Church of São Salvador () * Church of São Tiago () * Church of São Tomé () * Church of São Vicente () * Church of Santa Casa da Misericórdia () * Hermitage Memorial () * Monastery of Bustelo () * Monastery of Paço de Sousa () * Niche of Nossa Senhora de Fátima da Igreja () * Niche of Nossa Senhora de Fátima de São Mamede () * Niche of Nossa Senhora de Fátima de Uchada () * Niche of São José () * Paroquial Residence of Abragão () * Paroquial Residence of São Martinho de Recezinhos () * Sanctuary of Senhor dos Remédios () * Sanctuary of Senhora da Piedade e Santos Passos () * Way of the Cross of Penafiel () * Way of the Cross of Senhor dos Passos () Penafiel began building its library in 1863. On 6 June 1917, a new Municipal Library of Penafiel was inaugurated, located on Avenue Araújo e Silva, which closed in October 1919, reopened to the public on 6 June 1927 and was transferred to a small lounge on Avenida Sacadura Cabral.  Sports  The most popular/practised sport within the municipality is football (soccer), leading hundreds of young people to the existing clubs. The largest club, FC Penafiel, was founded in 1951 and has regular presence on many levels of professional Portuguese seasons. During the 2014–2015 season, the club played in the Premier League after obtaining a rise from the previous season, finishing in 3rd place behind Moreirense (Champion) and FC Porto B. The club is also involved in other athletics activities winning several national and international competitions.

It has also been found at elevations ranging from near sea level to about 7,500 feet.Berger, Andrew. Hawaiian Birdlife. 1972. In Japan it prefers forests of Abies and Tsuga with a dense understorey of bamboo. The species was introduced to the Hawaiian Islands in 1918 and spread to all the forested islands except Lanai. Its population on Oahu crashed in the 1960s and it disappeared from Kauai, but is now common and increasing on Oahu. The leiothrix was released in Western Australia but it failed to become established. This species was also introduced in Great Britain but permanent establishment was unsuccessful. It was introduced to France, where it is now established in several areas, and Spain where it is increasing and spreading from the Collserola Park.Herrando, Sergi, Llimona, Francesc, Brotons, Lluís and Quesada, Javier(2010) 'A new exotic bird in Europe: recent spread and potential range of Red-billed Leiothrix Leiothrix lutea in Catalonia (northeast Iberian Peninsula)', Bird Study, 57: 2, 226 — 235 . In Japan, naturalised populations of what is probably the nominate subspecies this species have been recorded since the 1980s and it has become established in central and southwestern Japan. It is also established on the Mascarene island of Réunion. The species has also been introduced in Italy where three major populations can be identified (Tuscany and Liguria, Latium, Colli Euganei) and there are several areas at high risk of invasion. Ecology and behavior The presence of the avian malaria parasite has been found in the blood of this species. = Diet= This bird feeds on animal matter. It eats fruits such as strawberries, ripened papaya, guavas and also various species of Diptera, Mollusca, Lepidoptera, and Hymenoptera. Its food is usually gathered from foliage and dead wood and it usually searches for food in lower strata of vegetation. = Reproduction= Eggs of Leiothrix lutea calipyga MHNT The leiothrix can usually be found in a group of about ten to thirty birds during the non-breeding season; however, during the breeding season the birds break off into pairs and become territorial. These birds have a song which consists of short powerful notes that are repeated continuously throughout the year but it is more persistent during the breeding season. This period usually lasts from early April until September and they are usually found around well watered areas. The males sing long complex songs with a wide array of syllables to attempt to attract the female. The leiothrix is an open cup nester.Amano, Hitoha, and Kazuhiro Eguchi. \\"Nest Site Selection of the Red-billed Leiothrix and Japanese Bush Warbler in Japan.\\" (2002) The nests of the red-billed leiothrix are composed of dry leaves, moss and lichen; however, they are not well hidden because concealment isn't really a primary factor when determining a nest site. Several nests are found between April and June and are placed within ten feet of the ground. Dense vegetation provides the shrub nesting species protection against predators. The eggs of the leiothrix are found in clutches of two to four eggs with an average of three. They are broad and blunt in shape with some gloss on the outside and they also have a pale blue color and red like brown spots that encircle the larger end of the eggs. The newly hatched birds have bright red skin and a rich orange red gape.

Cornering force is generated by tire slip and is proportional to slip angle at low slip angles. The rate at which cornering force builds up is described by relaxation length. Slip angle describes the deformation of the tire contact patch, and this deflection of the contact patch deforms the tire in a fashion akin to a spring. As with deformation of a spring, deformation of the tire contact patch generates a reaction force in the tire; the cornering force. Integrating the force generated by every tread element along the contact patch length gives the total cornering force. Although the term, \\"tread element\\" is used, the compliance in the tire that leads to this effect is actually a combination of sidewall deflection and deflection of the rubber within the contact patch. The exact ratio of sidewall compliance to tread compliance is a factor in tire construction and inflation pressure. Because the tire deformation tends to reach a maximum behind the center of the contact patch, by a distance known as pneumatic trail, it tends to generate a torque about a vertical axis known as self aligning torque. The diagram is misleading because the reaction force would appear to be acting in the wrong direction. It is simply a matter of convention to quote positive cornering force as acting in the opposite direction to positive tire slip so that calculations are simplified, since a vehicle cornering under the influence of a cornering force to the left will generate a tire slip to the right. The same principles can be applied to a tire being deformed longitudinally, or in a combination of both longitudinal and lateral directions. The behaviour of a tire under combined longitudinal and lateral deformation can be described by a traction circle.

Early life He was the son of Frederic Richard Sears and Albertina Homer Shelton. His brothers Philip and Herbert were also tennis players. Tennis career Sears learned to play tennis in 1879. He was undefeated in the U.S. Championships, he won the first of his seven consecutive titles in 1881 while still a student at Harvard. In those days the previous year's winner had an automatic place in the final. Starting in the 1881 first round, he went on an 18-match unbeaten streak that would take him through the 1887 championships, after which he retired from the game. Not until 1921 was his 18-match unbeaten run overtaken (by Bill Tilden). During his first three championships Sears did not lose a single set. Sears was the first 19-year-old to win in the U.S., slightly older than Oliver Campbell was in 1890 and the youngest winner ever, Pete Sampras, in 1990. Although primarily remembered for his grand slam titles he did compete in and win other titles. He won his first tournament at Beacon Park, Boston, in 1880 defeating Edward Gray . In May 1883 he reached the semi finals of the Longwood Bowl in Boston conceding to James Dwight by a walkover . In 1884 he traveled to Europe to play tournaments in Great Britain and Ireland . At the Irish Championships held in Dublin he reached the quarterfinals before losing to eventual champion Herbert Lawford in three sets. Sears had to witdraw from the Bath tournament due to a foot injury but in June he reached the final of the Cheltenham tennis tournament held on clay, losing in three sets to Donald Stewart. He then traveled to Manchester to compete at the Northern Lawn Tennis Championships where he also reached the quarterfinals, again losing to Stewart. Unable to compete at the Wimbledon Championships due to a wrist injury he returned to the United States in July after the U.S. Championships he entered the U.S. National Collegiate Championships in Hartford, Connecticut, where he reached the semi-finals. In June 1885 he won the Middle States Championships in Hoboken, New Jersey, defeating Howard Taylor. Sears was the first U.S. No. 1 in the USLTA rankings, when they began in 1885 and retained the ranking in 1886 and 1887.United States Lawn Tennis Association (1972). Official Encyclopedia of Tennis (First Edition), p. 407. After giving up playing lawn tennis, Sears won the U.S. Court Tennis singles title in 1892 and also served as USTA President in 1887 and 1888. Personal life Sears married Eleanor M. Cochrane on November 24, 1891, and they had two children, Richard Dudley Sears Jr. and Miriam Sears. He died on April 8, 1943. His grandson was the Massachusetts politician John W. Sears. Legacy Sears was inducted in the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1955, where his cousin Eleonora Sears also has a place.

It is for this that she was able to build a career in portraiture. Carriera would later become known for her pastel work, a medium appealing to Rococo styles for its soft edges and flattering surfaces. She is remembered as one of the most successful women artists of any era. Biography Born in Venice with two sisters, Carriera's family was from the lower-middle-class in Venice, and as a child, she began her artistic career by making lace-patterns for her mother, who was engaged in that trade. However, when interests in lace waned and the industry began to falter, Carriera had to find a new means of providing for herself and her family. The popularity of snuff-taking gave her an opportunity to do just that. Carriera began painting miniatures for the lids of snuff-boxes, and was the first painter to use ivory instead of vellum for this purpose. Gradually, this work evolved into portrait-painting, for which she pioneered the exclusive use of pastel. Prominent foreign visitors to Venice, young sons of the nobility on the grand tour and diplomats for example, clamored to be painted by her.Rosalba Carriera by Bernardina Sani, Umberto Allemandi & co. Ed. (1988), as reviewed by Francis Russell, The Burlington Magazine (1989) p857 The portraits of her early period include those of Maximilian II of Bavaria; Frederick IV of Denmark; the 12 most beautiful Venetian court ladies; the \\"Artist and her Sister Naneta\\" (Uffizi); and August the Strong of Saxony, who acquired a large collection of her pastels.New International Encyclopedia By 1700, Carriera was already creating miniatures and by 1703 she completed her first pastel portraits. In 1704, she was made an Accademico di merito by the Roman Accademia di San Luca, a title reserved for non-Roman painters. Female Portrait with Mask, (Fondazione Cariplo). By 1721, Carriera left Venice for Paris, as portraits by her were in great demand. While in Paris, Carriera was a guest of the great amateur and art collector, Pierre Crozat. She painted Watteau, all the royalty and nobility from the King and Regent downwards, and was elected a member of the Academy by acclamation.New International Encyclopedia Her brother-in-law, the painter Antonio Pellegrini, married to her sister Angela, was also in Paris that year. Pellegrini was employed by John Law, a Scottish financier and adventurer, to paint the ceiling of the Grand Salle in Law's new bank building. Carriera's other sister, Giovanna, and her mother, were members of the party in France. Both sisters, particularly Giovanna, helped her in painting the hundreds of portraits she was asked to execute. This was because she undertook a lot of work in order to support her family. Carriera's diary of these 18 months in Paris was later published by her devoted admirer, Antonio Zanetti, the Abbé Vianelli, in 1793. Her extensive correspondence has also been published.Rosalba Carriera: lettere, diari, frammenti by Bernardina Sani, Leo S. Olschski ed., Firenze (1985), as reviewed by Francis Haskell in The Burlington Magazine 1987. p122-123 In the short time she spent in Paris, Carriera's work contributed to forming the new aristocratic tastes of the court and by extension, the tastes of Parisians. No longer did art serve only the monarchy's needs. Her freedom, colorfulness and charms were injected into the Rococo style (which she was the face behind) which soon dominated the arts. Despite her triumph in Paris, she returned to her home in Grand Canal, Venice in 1721. Carriera, with her sister Giovanna in tow, visited Modena, Parma, and Vienna, and was received with much enthusiasm by rulers and courts. In later life, Carriera made a long journey to the royal court in Vienna, Austria. While there, Holy Emperor Charles VI became her benefactor and was fully committed to supporting her work. The Emperor amassed a large collection of more than 150 of her pastels. In return, the empress worked underneath her and received formal artistic training. The works she executed there were later to form the basis of the large collection in the Alte Meister Gallery in Dresden. After her sister Giovanna's death in 1738, Carriera fell into a deep depression which was not aided by the loss of her vision (which might have been damaged by miniature painting in her youth) some years later. She underwent two unsuccessful cataract surgeries but ended up losing her vision completely.Dabbs, Julia K. \\"Vision and Insight: Portraits of the Aged Woman Artist, 1600–1800.\\" ARCADE. Stanford, 31 May 2012. She outlived all her family, spending her last years in a little house in the Dorsoduro district of Venice, where she died at the age of 84. By the time of Carriera's death, the Rococo style was not as popular as before. Despite this, she was still a strong influence for many of the women artists that came after her, such as Catherine Read, Adélaïde Labille-Guiard and Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun.  Training  Carriera's mother taught her the art of lace making, but the artworks she became famous for were a result of her own self learning. Despite this, there is much speculation surrounding her education in art. It is said that the French painter Jean Steve encouraged her to make miniatures on ivory to decorate the lids of snuffboxes. Some also claim that she received initial instruction in oil technique from the Venetian painter Giuseppe Diamantini. Despite this, Carriera would share her talents with her sisters Giovana and Angela and later in life had female students as Marianna Carlevarijs, Margherita Terzi and Felicità Sartori.  Influence  Carriera's influence would spread widely among many. In 1720 she provided King Louis XV with a portrait that completed the transition from the previously accepted style of the court. It was a shift between what looked powerful and a decorative style with international appeal. She revolutionized the world of technology by binding colored chalk into sticks, which led to the development of a much wider range of prepared colors. This expanded the availability and the usefulness of the pastel medium. Although negatively dubbed ‘The Rococo’ by Maurice Quai, a follower of the neoclassicist Jacques-Louis David, Carriera played an important role in popularizing the style in France and later England, where George III was a major collector of her work. Despite her renown and contribution to an established manner, Carriera is \\"often treated as an exception, a rarity as a woman artist\\" and very often ignored. When the Rococo went out of mode, Carriera's name and her impact was dismissed and that had very much to do with gender as well. Rosalba Carriera is one of the main characters appearing in the novel The Laws of Time (2019) by Andrea Perego.  Works  Carriera was the first female painter to initiate a new style in the art community. The Rococo style emphasized the use of pastel colors; spontaneous brush strokes, dancing lights, subtle surface tonalities and a soft, elegant and charming approach to subject matter. She was known for dragging the sides of white chalk across an under-drawing of darker tones to capture the shimmering texture of lace and satin. She was also able to highlight facial features and the soft cascades of powdered hair. Because of her, artists created work in the style for nearly a century. Carriera had many patrons who were interested in her work. Her earliest known pastel portrait depicts the collector Anton Maria Zanetti (1700) who procured many works by the artist and promoted her to other collectors when he travelled throughout Europe. Joseph Smith was another one of her admirers and he too collected a great amount of her works. King George III later purchased these pieces in 1762. That collection contained one of many of her self-portraits. Her best- known self-portrait is one she contributed to the Medici collection of self- portraits at the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. This piece was different because she veered away from idealizing herself, as was a custom of the era. Instead, she was brusque and honest in her representation, featuring a larger nose, thin lips and a deep dimple in her chin. She holds a portrait of her sister and assistant Giovanna, whom she was very close to. Her self-portrait work diverges from typical expectations of women artists of the time by aiming for an unvarnished appearance. One such example is Self-Portrait as an Old Woman (1746), whose mismatched eyes hint at the eye problems which plagued her in later life.Frances Borzello, Seeing Ourselves: Women's Self-Portraiture 1998 Carriera was not just a portrait painter, even though that was her subject matter of choice due to her profession. She also created a few allegorical pieces, including ‘The Four Seasons’, ‘The Four Elements’ and ‘The Four Continents’. These allegories were represented by beautiful, nymph like and barely clothed women holding symbols that referenced the meaning of the piece.

He was one of the very few Loyalists to achieve any sort of national prominence in the United States after the American Revolution, and is best remembered for his role in the treason trial of former Vice President Aaron Burr in 1807.  Early life and family  John Wickham was the oldest son of John Wickham Sr. and his wife Mary Smith Fanning. Wickham was born in the colony of New York in the village of Cutchogue. His father was a minister in the Anglican Church and a Loyalist, while his uncle Parker Wickham was also a Loyalist, and was active in the local government. After the American Revolution, Parker Wickham was banished from New York State under an act of attainder. Despite vigorously declaring his innocence, Parker Wickham was never granted a trial and was sentenced to death if he returned to New York. The unfairness of this bitter event gave John Wickham a lifelong appreciation of the sanctity of a person's legal rights, regardless of their political affiliation. Although John Wickham was a first cousin of Revolutionary War hero Nathaniel Fanning, he was heavily influenced by his uncle Edmund Fanning, a colonel (later a general) in the British Army. Fanning raised a unit called the King's American Regiment, which Wickham served in as an ensign. While traveling through Virginia, Wickham was captured and put on trial as a spy, but acquitted.  Career  After the Revolutionary War, Wickham earned a degree in law from the College of William and Mary, where he became a close friend of John Marshall, later fourth Chief Justice of the U.S.. Wickham moved to Richmond and experienced tremendous financial success helping British merchants collect debts from American businessmen. He married his first cousin Mary Smith Fanning and had two children. After her early death, he married Elizabeth Seldon McClurg and had seventeen more children. McClurg was the daughter of Dr. James McClurg, Richmond Mayor, U.S. Congressman, and a delegate to the Philadelphia Convention, which framed the Constitution of the United States in 1787. In 1807, Wickham was lead counsel for Aaron Burr in his trial for treason. Although Thomas Jefferson took an active role in trying to have his former Vice President executed, Burr was found innocent. Wickham's old friend John Marshall was the presiding judge. Wickham bred racehorses. The best and most famous of them all was Boston, which he lost in a card game. Boston became one of the greatest horses of his time, and sired the greatest stud, Lexington.  Legacy  His interment was located in Richmond's Shockoe Hill Cemetery. Wickham's numerous descendants continued to be active in Virginia affairs. His grandson Williams Carter Wickham was a Confederate general, and served as the first president of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway. His granddaughter Charlotte Wickham was married to William Henry Fitzhugh Lee, the son of General Robert E. Lee. Wickham's residence, Wickham House, is now part of the Valentine Richmond History Center.

He was the husband of Shakuntala and the father of the Emperor Bharatha. He appears in the Mahabharata and in Kalidasa's play The Recognition of Sakuntala (c. 300 CE). His name is also transliterated as Dusyanta or Dushyant, and means \\"Destroyer of the Evil\\" in Sanskrit. Legends According to the Mahābhārata, Dushyanta is the son of Ilina and Rathantara.Mahabharata, Adi Parva, Sambhava Parva He was king of Hastinapur and ancestor of the Kuru dynasty. Dushyant met his wife Shakuntala while on an excursion from his kingdom at the hermitage of sage Kanva. Dushyanta and Shakuntala had a son named Bharata who went on to become an emperor. =Love for Shakuntala= The story of Dushyanta's encounter, marriage, separation and reunion with his queen, Shakuntala, has been immortalized in the Mahabharata and in The Recognition of Shakuntala by the great Sanskrit poet Kalidas. Dushyant meets Shakuntala, who is a daughter of Vishvamitra and Menaka, while on an excursion from his kingdom. Depending on the source, Dushyant is either the crown prince, or he is waiting to win back his kingdom from an enemy. Either way, he sees Shakuntala in an ashram (hermitage) of Rishi Kanva and falls in love. He and Shakuntala have a gandharva marriage there. Having to leave after some time, Dushyant gives Shakuntala a royal ring as a sign of their love, promising her that he will come to her. But when Dushyant becomes king, he becomes too absorbed for many years in affairs of state. Shakuntala waits and despairs. One day, sage Durvasa visits the hermitage, but Shakuntala, who is too absorbed in her love for Dushyant, forgets to serve him food. In a fit of anger, sage Durvasa curses her, saying that the person she is thinking about will forget her. A shocked Shakuntala begs for forgiveness and the sage, after recollecting his calm, assures her that the person will remember her again when she shows some proof of their acquaintance. So, Shakuntala sets off to the capital, Hastinapur, to remind Dushyant of their past love. An accident occurs by which a fish consumes the royal ring, leaving Shakuntala with no formidable proof. Dushyanta does not recollect Shakuntala, but his memory and love are rekindled when a sage (not the same who cursed Shakuntala) recovers the ring and brings it to the court. Dushyanta weds Shakuntala, who becomes his queen and mother of his son, Bharata. A different version of the story involves Shakuntala's father, the great and legendary sage Vishwamitra, who is said to have bowed his head to none. Dushyant's forgetting of Shakuntala was a device invented by the other sages, including Vashishta, to make Vishwamitra bow. For the sake of his daughter the great sage is said to have bowed before the great king Dushyant to persuade him to accept his daughter. The sages, delighted, immediately brought the memory of Shakuntala into the mind of Dushyant. =Reunion= Bharata (Sarvadamana), the son of Dushyanta and Shakuntala. Painting by Raja Ravi Varma. According to many literary sources, Dushyanta was the father of Bharata, who is generally credited with uniting India under his rule (see origin of India's name). According to the Mahābhārata Adiparva, Bharata was born while Shakuntala awaited Dushyanta at her hermitage. Later they were re united.

Biography Born in Brantford, Ontario, the son of James and Ethel (Cooke) Hillier, he received a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics and Physics (1937), Master of Arts (1938), and a Ph.D (1941) from the University of Toronto, where, as a graduate student, he completed a prototype of the electron microscope that had been invented by Ernst Ruska. This transmission electron microscope was used as a prototype for later electron microscopes. In 1941, he went to the United States of America and joined the Radio Corporation of America in Camden, New Jersey. He became General Manager, RCA Laboratories (1957); Vice President, RCA Laboratories (1958); Vice President, Research and Engineering (1968); Executive Vice President, Research and Engineering (1969); and Executive Vice President and Chief Scientist (1976). New technologies developed during his tenure include the system that became RCA SelectaVision. (Note: RCA Laboratories, located in Princeton, NJ, became independent of RCA as a result of the corporate take-over by General Electric in 1986 and became Sarnoff Corporation, a subsidiary of SRI International through 2011, when it was absorbed by SRI.) Hillier spent many years refining the electron microscope and marketing it to research laboratories and universities, receiving a total of 41 patents for devices and processes. After retiring from RCA in 1977, Dr. Hillier advised on the role of technology in the Third World and promoted science education. Although he became a U.S. citizen in 1945, Hillier remained involved with the Brantford community throughout his lifetime. The James Hillier Foundation, established in 1993, awards annual scholarships to Brant County students pursuing education in science. In 1936, he married Florence Marjory Bell, a union that lasted until Florence's death in 1992. They had two sons: James Robert Hillier and William Wynship Hillier. On January 15, 2007, Hillier died in Princeton, New Jersey due to a stroke.

The city sits along the seasonal Ngadda River which disappears into the Firki swamps in the areas around Lake Chad. Maiduguri was founded in 1907 as a military outpost by the British and has since grown rapidly with a population exceeding a million by 2007. History =Early period= The region was home to the Kanem-Bornu Empire for centuries. Maiduguri actually consists of two cities: Yerwa to the West and Old Maiduguri to the east. Yerwa was founded in 1907 by Abubakar Garbai of Borno as the capital of the Bornu Kingdom. The location had before that been a small village known as Kalwa. This involved the transfer of the capital of the Kanuri people from Kukawa. Old Maiduguri was selected by the British as their military headquarters in 1908 replacing Mafoni. In that same year it became the location for the British resident commissioner over British Bornu. In 1957 Yerwa became the designated name for the urban center while Maiduguri was officially applied as the name of the surrounding rural area. In 1964 the railway was extended here which lead to its rise as a major commercial center in the region. The city was once known as a \\"hub of Islamic scholarship in West Africa that ... [taught] tolerance and hospitality like its welcoming neem trees.\\" Maiduguri is one of the sixteen LGAs that constitute the Borno Emirate, a traditional state located in Borno State, Nigeria. =Islamist violence= Since the mid-1960s, Maiduguri has witnessed outbreaks of large inter-religious riots. Members of religious sects led intercommunal violence in 1982 and 2001. On 18 February 2006, riots related to the Muhammad cartoons published by the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten left at least 15 people dead, and resulted in the destruction of approximately 12 churches. Soldiers and police quelled the riots, and the government temporarily imposed a curfew. In 2002, Muslim cleric Mohammed Yusuf founded the Islamist group Boko Haram in Maiduguri, establishing a mosque and a madrasa that attracted children from poor Muslim families from both Nigeria and neighboring countries.  Boko Haram attacks  The city is the heart of the Boko Haram insurgency and is the city which is most often attacked by the group.Blasts kill 4, injure 18 in northeastern Nigeria In late July 2009, Maiduguri was the worst-hit location of major religious violence in northern Nigeria committed by Boko Haram, which left over 700 people dead. On 14 May 2013, President Goodluck Jonathan declared a state of emergency in northeast Nigeria, including Borno State, due to the militant activity of Boko Haram. The entire city was under overnight curfew, and trucks have been prevented from entering the city. Twelve areas of the city that are known to be strongholds of Boko Haram are under permanent curfew. On 18 June 2013, Boko Haram militants attacked a school as students were taking an exam; nine students were killed. In 2014, Boko Haram bombed Maiduguri in January, July and November. On 10 January 2015, a bomb attack was executed at the Monday Market in Maiduguri, killing 19 people. In the early hours of 25 January, Boko Haram launched a major assault on the city. On 26 January, CNN reported that the attack on Maiduguri by \\"hundreds of gunmen\\" had been repelled, but the nearby town of Monguno was captured by Boko Haram. The Nigerian Army claimed to have successfully repelled another attack on Maiduguri on 31 January 2015. On 17 February 2015, Monguno subsequently fell to the Nigerian military in a coordinated air and ground assault. On 7 March 2015, five suicide bomb blasts left 54 dead and 143 wounded. On 30 May 2015, Boko Haram launched another attack on the city, killing thirteen people. In March 2017 Boko Haram again bombed Maiduguri. =Giwa barracks= The Giwa barracks and detention centre in Maiduguri has been subject to multiple attacks by Boko Haram. In 2014, reports suggested that 600 people were killed in an attack, though most were detainees killed by soldiers. It was attacked in January/February 2015, bombed in March 2015, and attacked again in May 2015. In May 2016, Amnesty International released a report on the Giwa barracks detention centre, calling it a \\"place of death.\\" The report alleges the facilities house about 1,200 people (including 120 children) and that many of these were detained arbitrarily. It further claims that 149 detainees had died in the first half of 2016, including 11 children. In 2019, Ammesty International (AI) and Concerned Nigerians (CN) called for investigation into alleged abuse of women and children in the facility. Tramadol addiction has become a concern in the Maduguri region, as Boko Haram fighters and local residents turn to the drug to cope with physical pain, personal loss, and the emotional consequences of violence. Climate Köppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as hot semi-arid (BSh). The highest record temperature was on 28 May 1983, while the lowest record temperature was on 26 December 1979. Tree planting was a priority of the city's colonial administration, and large trees along major roads give protection from intense sun. Demographics Maiduguri is estimated to have a population of 1,907,600, as of 2007. It grew in size by between 2002 and 2012. Its residents are mostly Muslim including Kanuri, Hausa, Shuwa, Bura, Marghi, and Fulani ethnic groups. There is also a considerable Christian population and people from Southern states such as the Igbo, Ijaw, and Yoruba. Miduguri had 22 internally displaced persons camps in 2019, including Shagari camp with 48 households, and Cherubim & Seraphim camp with 65 households. The NYC (National Youth Service) in Maiduguri housed 4,800 displaced people in 2016. Goni Kachallari had 340 families in 2016. Languages spoken in the camps include Fulani, Fulfulde, Gamargu, Hausa (8.4% native speakers), Kanuri (53.5% native speakers), and Shuwa Arabic. About a third of survey respondents had comprehension of a simple English audio sample; close to 100% had comprehension of audio messaging in either Hausa or Kanuri.  Transport  The city lies at the end of a railway line connecting Port Harcourt, Enugu, Kafanchan, Kuru, Bauchi, and finally Maiduguri. The city is served by the Maiduguri International Airport. Economy Maiduguri is the principal trading hub for north-eastern Nigeria. Its economy is largely based on services and trade with a small share of manufacturing. Maiduguri is home to three markets which include an ultra modern \\"Monday market\\" that has a spectacular satellite image view. The city has an appealing layout,Maiduguri: The jewel in the Sahara. Ikenna Emewu. Daily Sun (Nigeria), 7 August 2004. with wide, well maintained streets, sidewalks and flood management ditches. Electricity is provided by grid connections, solar power and by generators. The values of land and properties are high. A 2009 survey of property markets in Nigeria positioned Maiduguri as the third most expensive for buying and renting in after Abuja and Lagos. A journalist who described local commerce wrote that \\"on the edge of the city, never-ending lines of lorries spend days waiting to take their cargoes to Dikwa and beyond to neighbouring Cameroon.\\" \\"Transport of goods to land-locked countries such as Chad, Central African Republic and Sudan\\" has suffered due to road ambushes. Rural-urban migration to Maiduguri, combined with migration from Chad, Niger and Cameroon, has led to increases in poverty and unemployment Firewood gathering is a source of income for newer residents who have been displaced by violence, and the harvest shortfalls resulting from climate change. Members of Maiduguri's official Association of Firewood Sellers provide labor for tree replanting efforts. An additional source of support for displaced persons is a mobile phone-based cash distribution site which was set up by the World Food Programme and the Nigerian Government. Education The University of Maiduguri was founded in 1975. There is also the College of Medical Sciences. Other higher institutions include the Borno State University, Ramat Polytechnic, College of Agriculture and College of Education, Muhammad Goni College of Legal and Islamic Studies, College of Nursing and Midwifery, College of Health Technology and El-kanemi College of Islamic Theology, Annahada College of Science and Islamic Studies. As of 2011, the Future Prowess Islamic School provided a free, co-ed Western and Islamic education to orphans and vulnerable children.  Places of worship  Among the places of worship, they are predominantly Muslims mosques.J. Gordon Melton, Martin Baumann, ‘‘Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices’’, ABC-CLIO, USA, 2010, p. 2107 There are also Christian churches and temples : Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion), Church of the Brethren in Nigeria (EYN), Presbyterian Church of Nigeria (World Communion of Reformed Churches), Nigerian Baptist Convention (Baptist World Alliance), Living Faith Church Worldwide, Redeemed Christian Church of God, Assemblies of God, Roman Catholic Diocese of Maiduguri (Catholic Church). Sports and leisure It is home to the El-Kanemi Warriors, a football team and the city has an active local football league. The Kyarimi Park is the oldest and largest zoo in Nigeria. The zoo attracts thousands of visitors per year. The city is within a short driving distance to picnic areas in Alo Lake and Zambiza game reserve.

They had the shortest reign for the now-retired WCW World Tag Team Championship, which was held by Corporal Cajun and Lieutenant Loco. History The original Misfits stable was started on the April 17, 2000, episode of WCW Monday Nitro when Eric Bischoff berated a crew of wrestlers including Hugh Morrus, Lash LeRoux, Chavo Guerrero, Jr., and Booker T. along with Bam Bam Bigelow (who remained heel) and Jerry Flynn (on his last appearance on WCW TV) for not helping the New Blood dispatch the Millionaire's Club. On the April 26, 2000, episode of WCW Thunder, LeRoux, Guerrero, Morrus, and Van Hammer saved Booker T after his match against Mike Awesome during a beatdown by Awesome and Scott Steiner. The following week, Leroux, Hammer, and Guerrero made the save for Morrus on the May 1, 2000, episode of WCW Monday Nitro to solidify their alliance. Immediately after the match, an enraged Bischoff fired Morrus and the three men who made the save. Shortly after, the \\"released\\" wrestlers reappeared in WCW under their new M.I.A. names. Despite the obvious fraud, they signed new contracts with their new names, allowing themselves to evade Bischoff's firings. The returning group initially consisted of Morrus as Captain/General Hugh G. Rection, Guerrero as Lt. Loco, LeRoux as Cpl. Cajun, and Van Hammer as Major Stash. They were given a valet in former fitness model Tylene Buck, who went under the name Major Gunns. The group mainly feuded with The Filthy Animals, Team Canada, and The Natural Born Thrillers. Gunns feuded with the Filthy Animals' valet Tygress. Other members were added as the group's popularity rose over the final years of the company. In July 2000, Hammer was released from WCW. On the July 26, 2000, episode of WCW Thunder, The Wall would be added as Sgt. AWOL. On the November 13, 2000, episode of WCW Monday Nitro, Gunns eventually betrayed the group in favor of turning heel by joining Team Canada, when she threw in the towel on the behalf of Rection, costing him the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship against Lance Storm.

Villa Crespo is a middle class neighborhood in Buenos Aires, Argentina, located in the geographical center of the city. It had a population of 83,646 people in 2001, and thus currently a population density of 23,235 inhabitants/km2. Villa Crespo celebrates its anniversary on June 3. Villa Crespo was also sometimes referred to as Palermo Queens around 2007. This trade name, caused a reaction from the Neighborhood Association and Historical Studies at the Ombudsman of the city of Buenos Aires. They issued Resolution 2549/07, resulting in 14 realtors being sanctioned for publishing misleading advertising, in violation of the consumer competition law and fair trading law, and violation of the law of neighborhood boundaries and the tourist protection law. Palermo is considered a more expensive neighborhood and renaming Villa Crespo as part of Palermo would allow people to charge higher rents, etc. It grew around the \\"Fábrica Nacional de Calzado\\" (National Shoe Factory, 1888). The first name of the neighborhood was San Bernardo and that remained in general use during its first twenty-five years, in spite of it being officially named after Buenos Aires mayor, Antonio F. Crespo. On April 11, 1894, the San Bernardo church was opened to the public. Villa Crespo was home to several conventillos, including the most famous one, the Conventillo de la Paloma. Under Juan B. Justo avenue runs the Maldonado waterstream, culverted to prevent major floods. Villa Crespo has been traditionally associated with the Jewish community, hosting several synagogues, Hebrew schools and youth movements. Its traditional football club is Atlanta. Until the 1980s, it had a clothing commercial centre in Scalabrini Ortiz Avenue (previously named Canning), but this has lost its strength over the years. The main commercial hub is still the intersection of Scalabrini Ortiz and Corrientes avenues, these two roads being also the main access of the neighborhood.

It has traditionally been the base of the Avengers. The enormous, city block-sized building is located at 890 Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, New York City. Creative origin Avengers Mansion's address is 890 Fifth Avenue in the borough of Manhattan in New York City. According to Stan Lee, who co-created the Avengers: Lee later recounted, \\"I can't tell you how many fan letters I would receive from kids saying, 'We came to New York and we were looking for the Stark mansion and couldn't find it. What address is it?' [laughs] So that made me feel good. I felt we had accomplished our objective. We had made it seem realistic.\\" In real life, 890 Fifth Avenue is 1 East 70th Street, the location of the Henry Clay Frick House, which houses the Frick Collection. The building is, like Avengers Mansion, a city block-sized mansion. Fictional history and layout When occupied, the mansion was originally the Stark family manor, until their only son, Tony Stark, inherited their fortune and soon took on the guise of Iron Man. He donated the mansion to the Avengers and had it financed through the charitable Maria Stark Foundation. It was primarily looked after by the Stark family butler, Edwin Jarvis, who not only took care of the mansion but also catered to the needs of the Avengers team. It served as a place to plan and strategize and a home for Avengers members when they needed it. It had three above-ground floors and three basement floors. The first three floors were open to the public and had twelve rooms to house Avengers who wished to reside in the mansion, as well as Jarvis's quarters. A portion of the mansion's third floor served as a hangar for the Avengers' quinjets, their primary mode of transportation. The three floors below ground were restricted from the public and had modified rooms for the Avengers' needs. Such rooms below ground were: Howard Stark's \\"Arsenal\\" chamber, the Avengers gym, Hawkeye's test-shooting room, the training room (much like the X-Mansion's Danger Room), the cryogenic storage area, a vault to contain Jack of Hearts's power, and the ultra-secure assembly room. The Fantastic Four took up temporary residence at Avengers Mansion after their headquarters (the original Baxter Building) was destroyed.Fantastic Four #282 (Sept. 1985). The mansion has been destroyed twice. The first time was in Avengers: Under Siege when a huge grouping of Masters of Evil, led by Baron Helmut Zemo, attacked the Avengers and destroyed the Mansion and beat Hercules into a coma among other things before being repulsed. In the immediate aftermath, the Avengers would relocate to a floating platform called Hydro-Base,\\"Avengers\\" #278 (April 1987) while the former Mansion site became known as \\"Avengers Park\\", and was unused. Hydro- Base was later destroyed as well.\\"Avengers\\" #311 (Dec. 1989) The Mansion would be featured in a Damage Control story. The reconstruction firm was hired to refit and rebuild the mansion, a task they accomplished easily. Unfortunately they did not manage to move it as easily and it fell into one of New York's rivers. Later, the Avengers built a new headquarters on the site of the Mansion and resided there until it was destroyed by the Gatherers, a team of alternate universe Avengers. Ute, a Watcher enslaved by the villain Proctor, brought an alternate reality version of the original Avengers Mansion to the site as a dying gift. This replacement Mansion would survive various assaults until, in the \\"Avengers Disassembled\\" storyline, the Scarlet Witch was responsible for its destruction by bringing an undead version of Jack of Hearts that exploded, also killing Scott Lang, the second Ant-Man, and in Avengers Finale (January 2005), Stark decided that with his dwindling assets, he could no longer afford to maintain the building and it was abandoned in its derelict state, left as a memorial to the Avengers who had died. Stark, using his considerable political and social influence, had the grounds declared a landmark by the city of New York. Since then, the Young Avengers have restored much of the statuary on the grounds of the mansion. The Avengers have relocated to Stark Tower, although it is unknown how permanent this move will be, especially in light of the events of Marvel's Civil War storyline, which causes the virtual splitting of the New Avengers down the line between those who were pro-registration and those who were against it. Even after its destruction, the mansion remains a hub of superhuman activity. The Young Avengers were attacked by, and later defeated, Kang the Conqueror there. They later restored the many statues in the mansion's grounds, adopting the mansion as their meeting place. During the highest tensions of the Civil War incident, Iron Man and Captain America meet at the ruins in order to talk things out. They tour the grounds and even find abandoned framed photographs of old allies. Former Avenger Clint Barton has made his way on to the grounds several times since then, most recently following Captain America's death. He meets with Tony Stark to discuss the implications of Steve Rogers' assassination. After the Skrull invasion, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s replacement agency H.A.M.M.E.R. kept an eye on the mansion in case the Young Avengers, still wanted for refusing to be registered, showed up. The young group did anyway, using the building as a central point for many meetings.The Mighty Avengers #21-30 Following the Siege of Asgard and at the start of the Heroic Age, Steve Rogers and Tony Stark sold the mansion to Luke Cage for a dollar allowing him freedom to recruit his own Avengers team and operate from the mansion while the other Avengers team operate from the Infinite Avengers Mansion and Avengers Tower.New Avengers (vol. 2) #1 After an extended period, and severe damage thanks to Daniel Drumm the New Avengers dissolve, and Cage sells the mansion back to Stark for five dollars.New Avengers (vol. 2) #34 After yet another roster reshuffling, the mansion was refitted as the headquarters for the new Avengers Unity Squad which is funded by Janet Van Dyne. A computerized A.I. system called J.A.R.V.I.S. is installed to replace Edwin Jarvis (who still lives in Avengers Tower with the main team).Uncanny Avengers #5 Following the reconstruction of the multiverse, the mansion officially became a theme hotel as the Avengers teams move on to other bases, but they were unaware that the Red Skull and Sin are hiding in a secure room under the mansion, carrying out an unspecified plan.Uncanny Avengers vol.2 #6 After this, the mansion was purchased by Unity Squad member Johnny Storm with the money he had inherited from his apparently dead brother-in-law's patents, who created Avengers Mansion Inc. to run the property on behalf of the Avengers. Surrounding grounds The Mansion was surrounded by a wall twelve feet high and one foot thick, as well as an array of high-tech security defenses. A main feature of the defenses were large, restrictive coils. These were sometimes backed up by energy beams that shot out from the ground. Nonetheless, those defenses were often breached by the supervillains faced by the Avengers. Shortly after the Avengers moved into the Mansion, Iron Man and Thor moved the Mansion 35 feet away from the street, increasing the size of the front lawn and giving the Avengers more privacy. When Tony Stark was the United States' Secretary of Defense, the mansion's security systems were backed up by government forces. The mansion's grounds featured an array of statues of past and present Avengers, constructed out of adamantium. The statues were destroyed in a battle with the Asgardian god, Loki.Avengers #400 One of the trees on the grounds used to hold a miniature lab belonging to Hank Pym. The statues return around the time the 'New Avengers' leave the mansion.

(Simplified Chinese: 邓以明; Traditional Chinese: 鄧以明; Pinyin: Dèng Yǐmíng; Wade-Giles: Teng I-ming; May 13, 1908 - June 27, 1995) was a Chinese Jesuit priest. Appointed Bishop in 1951 and later archbishop of Canton, he spent twenty-two years in jail for his loyalty to the Catholic Church and died in exile in the United States. Jesuit and Bishop  He was born in Hong Kong and decided to enter the Jesuit novitiate in Spain in August 1930. Back in China, he studied Catholicism in Shanghai. He was ordained as a priest at the age of 33 on 31 May 1941Kung Foundation website during World War II. After his ordination he worked as a parish priest, principal of a primary school and did social welfare work in the Ecclesiastical Province of Guangzhou. Pope Pius XII appointed him on 1 October 1950 as Apostolic Administrator of Canton (Guangzhou), and on 13 February 1951 was ordained titular bishop of Elateia by Bishop Gustave Deswaziere, who said of him: \\"By accepting the appointment from the Holy See in these difficult times, the new bishop was showing absolute obedience and a spirit of sacrifice.\\" Twenty-two years in Jail  Archbishop Tang was arrested on February 5, 1958. The People's Republic of China charged him as \\"the most faithful running-dog of the reactionary Vatican.\\" He remained in jail for 22 years in Laogai prison because he refused to sever contact with the Pope, as the government ordered him to. His sudden release in 1981 was due to a developing cancer, he then was given permission to leave the People's Republic of China for a cancer operation in Hong Kong.Encyclopædia Britannica Archbishop Tang was never brought to trial, and therefore, was never convicted of any crime. After his release, he never showed any bitterness for his 22 years of imprisonment, even though no apology was ever given by the Chinese government. Later years  On 26 May 1981, at the age of 73, he was appointed Archbishop of Canton (Guangzhou), which was rejected by China at once. In 1987, he released his book How Inscrutable His Ways! In it he summarized his attitudes while incarcerated for 22 years: * \\"In prison, I always asked God to grant me the grace to progress in virtue., e.g. humility and obedience....I obeyed only the regulations which did not conflict with the principles of my faith. I want to be gentle and kind to others, without resisting ill-treatment from others; when controlled and walked on, I did not complain. There are many opportunities for practicing virtue in prison.\\" * \\"When I was a seminarian, I learned to do God's will. God's will required me to practice virtue in prison.

Ruslan was born and raised in Surabaya, East Java. He came from an upper-middle-class family; his father was a neighborhood shopkeeper and owned a small fleet of taxis. His mother, his father's second wife, was a religious tutor, giving reading and religion lessons from the Qur'an. According to a memoir of his childhood, which Ruslan wrote in the 1970s, his mother was also a strong Javanese nationalist, and it was from her that he first learned about Dutch colonial rule and the possibility of independence. During the Indonesian fight for independence from the Dutch in the late 1940s, Ruslan was a key lieutenant under Sukarno, earning the future president's trust and ensuring him a secure place in the new government. In the 1950s he served most prominently as foreign minister, representing Indonesia abroad during the tumultuous decade when, under Sukarno's leadership, Indonesia tried to transform itself into a postcolonial, anti-imperialist success story. Ruslan's most prominent moment as a public servant came in 1955, when he served as secretary-general of the Bandung Conference, a major meeting of African and Asian countries working to form what became the Non-Aligned Movement as an alternative to alignment with one of the Cold War superpowers. Ruslan served as Indonesia's foreign minister from March 1956 to April 1957. From July 1959 to March 1962, he was head of the Supreme Advisory Council (DPA); in October 1962 he became Minister of Information. While being foreign minister, Ruslan was briefly arrested in August 1956 by the Indonesian military in West Java, and accused of corruption. Part of a power struggle between the Sukarno government and dissatisfied military officers, he was promptly pardoned by vote of Sukarno's cabinet, and the military was forced to release him. While being a minister in 1964, he was a first rector of Teacher and Education Science Institute or now is Indonesia University of Education. He acted as rector until 1966. After Suharto replaced Sukarno as president in 1967, Ruslan served briefly as Indonesian ambassador to the United Nations. He left formal government service in 1971, but continued to play a role as an elder statesman in Indonesian politics. After president Suharto stepped down in 1998, he emerged as an advisor to presidential candidate Megawati Sukarnoputri, Sukarno's daughter, and as a critic of Suharto's Golkar successors, Jusuf Habibie and Abdurrahman Wahid. In 1998 Dutch historians Bob de Graaff and Cees Wiebes published a book, Villa Maarheeze: De Geschiedenis van de Inlichtingendienst Buitenland (Villa Maarheeze: The History of the Netherlands Foreign Intelligence Service) in which they alleged that Ruslan had secretly worked for the Dutch government during the conflict over Papua (Irian Jaya) in the 1960s, by passing confidential information about Indonesian activities. Ruslan vehemently denied the charges, saying that he had seldom even communicated with the Dutch government even in his official government capacities. Ruslan's wife Sihwati Nawangwulan, also a prominent activist during Indonesia's independence movement, died in 2001 at the age of 85. Ruslan and Sihwati had five children together. Ruslan died in June 2005 after suffering from stroke and pneumonia. He was one of the last survivors of Indonesia's war for independence. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono called him \\"a leader who never said bad things about others\\". Suharto called him \\"a great man and leader who has given so much for the country he loves\\". His second daughter, Retnowati Abdulgani-Knapp, wrote a biography about her father, A Fading Dream: The Story of Roeslan Abdulgani and Indonesia, which was published in 2003. In it, she described Ruslan as a lifelong fighter against colonialism and imperialism. Abdulgani was awarded the Grand Decoration of Honour in Gold with Sash for Services to the Republic of Austria in 1956.

The film won the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Movie, and Kareena Kapoor won the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress for her performance. Plot Joint Commissioner of Police Dev Pratap Singh, a duty-bound, self-righteous officer, and Special Commissioner Tejinder Khosla, the balancing force between the political interests of Chief Minister Bhandarker and Dev's commitment to the law, are lifelong friends, each with his own ideals. Farhaan, a law graduate, was brought up with ideals of non-violence and patriotism. Dev unwittingly gives Farhaan the wound that plunges him into rage and violence after witnessing the death of his father during a peace demonstration. Taking advantage of the situation, corrupt politician Latif sets the vulnerable young man on a path of violence and destruction that threatens to ignite the city. Aaliya is the light in Farhaan's life. Beautiful and innocent, the young woman also gets caught in extraordinary circumstances that transform her life and she dares to stand up for the truth. Dev is the saga of Dev and Tej's friendship, a bond stronger than blood ties in which Farhaan emerges as the wedge driving them apart. The story unfolds against the vitiated atmosphere of present times where innocent lives become fodder for political expediency. The spark of terrorist violence unknowingly set off by Farhaan under the aegis of the corrupt politician Latif engulfs the whole city in its flames. Tej transgresses beyond the boundaries of law in his passion to eliminate anti- national crime. Dev is faced with the spectre of the tragic human cost and a moral compulsion to act. The stakes rise beyond self-interest. Dev and Tej are set on a path of dramatic collision. Even as Dev and Farhaan's fate gets irreversibly linked, two soldiers whose allegiance may be to different causes but admiration for each other's courage and integrity brings them together. On a train bound for Bombay from Surat, a Police Inspector questions a young man named Farhaan, who has just obtained his law degree, for his reason to go to Bombay, and whether he has any alliance with Pakistanis. Farhaan answers that he is going to Bombay to live with his father, and he does not know anyone from Pakistan. Farhaan finds out that Bombay Police have been targeting the Muslim community, and in the name of fighting terrorism, have been killing innocent Muslim men, women and children. He comes to know that Joint Commissioner of Police, Dev Pratap Singh, is involved in this witch-hunt, and he would like to kill him. Farhaan joins hands with the local Muslim political leader, Latif, and he is provided training in handling guns, and is subsequently made ready for this task. Unfortunately, Farhaan is unable to kill Dev, who escapes unhurt, albeit a little shaken. Chief Minister Bhandarkar views this incident seriously, and instructs the police to root out terrorist elements in the city, which they do so ruthlessly. Farhaan is told to deliver a package to a man near a Hindu temple, and he does so. While at a stop to buy some snacks, the package explodes, killing several people. Since this incident occurred near a Hindu temple, a right-wing political party member, Mangal Rao, organizes a wave of riots against the Muslim community. Riots take place, and the police are instructed to observe and not prevent the violence. As a result, hundreds are killed. Latif organizes his men to target and attack Hindus and Hindu establishments, rendering the region unsafe, with people being killed in the name of religion. When Hindus and Muslims have had enough, they publicly ask for peace, it is only then Latif and Mangal Rao agree on a truce, on the condition that no Muslim male, female or child will file a FIR (First Information Report) in any police station, to which Latif agrees. Latif then warns everyone in the Muslim community not to complain against anyone. Period. It is then Farhaan finds out that he has been treated as a pawn by Latif, and decides to trust Dev and become an informer. But will Dev trust a man who just attempted to kill him? And will Latif and Mangal Rao join forces to eliminate Farhaan, who now has become a liability to both sides.

Flippen (March 6, 1899 – February 3, 1971) was an American character actor who often played police officers or weary criminals in many films of the 1940s and 1950s. Biography Born on March 6, 1899 in Little Rock, Arkansas, Flippen was an established and respected vaudeville singer and stage actor before his film career. He had been discovered by famed African-American comedian Bert Williams in the 1920s, and was Williams's Broadway understudy and tour replacement for the 1920 musical revue \\"Broadway Brevities.\\"\\"Jay C. Flippen to Record for the Columbia Co.\\" Talking Machine World, 15 August 1921. He called himself \\"The Ham What Am,\\" and his occasional blackface roles included those as Williams' replacement.\\"Flippen to Record,\\" 1921. Flippen attained the most coveted booking in vaudeville, headlining at the Palace Theatre in New York six times between March 1926 and February 1931.The Encyclopedia of Vaudeville, Anthony Slide, p. 186 In 1928, he proclaimed he would no longer perform in blackface.\\"Flippen Gives Up Burnt Cork.\\" Brooklyn Standard-Union, 6 October 1928. At one time, he was also a radio announcer for New York Yankees games and was one of the first game-show announcers. Between 1924 and 1929, Flippen recorded more than 30 songs for Columbia, Perfect, and Brunswick. His first film, the 1928 Warner Bros. short subject \\"The Ham What Am\\", captures his vaudeville performance, with other shorts in the 1930s, but his film career started in earnest in 1947. Some of Flippen's most noteworthy film work came in support of James Stewart in five of the films the two made under the direction of Anthony Mann during the 1950s. He gave notable supporting performances in three John Wayne films: as a humorous, larcenous Marine air-crew line chief in Flying Leathernecks (1951), as Wayne's commanding general in Jet Pilot (1957), and as a wheelchair-bound senior partner of Wayne's in Hellfighters (1968). He also made a fourth film that co- starred John Wayne (How the West Was Won, 1962), but played his only scene with Debbie Reynolds and Gregory Peck. He also appeared on television, including a 1960 guest-starring role as Gabe Jethrow in the episode \\"Four Came Quietly\\" on the CBS Western series Johnny Ringo, starring Don Durant. In 1962, he guest-starred on the ABC drama series Bus Stop as Mike Carmody in \\"Verdict of 12\\" and Follow the Sun as Fallon in \\"The Last of the Big Spenders\\". He also appeared on ABC's The Untouchables as Al Morrisey in \\"You Can't Pick the Number\\" (1959) and as Big Joe Holvak in \\"Fall Guy\\" (1962). In the 1962-63 season, Flippen was cast as Chief Petty Officer Homer Nelson on the NBC sitcom Ensign O'Toole, with Dean Jones in the starring role. He also guest-starred on CBS' The Dick Van Dyke Show in its first season, playing Rob Petrie's former mentor Happy Spangler. In 1964, he appeared as Owney in an episode of CBS' Gunsmoke with James Arness. In 1963, he guest-starred on Bonanza. He appeared four times on NBC's The Virginian in the 1960s; in 1966, he appeared on the ABC comedy Western The Rounders. In 1967, Tom Tryon and he guest-starred in the episode \\"Charade of Justice\\" of the NBC Western series The Road West. After a leg amputation in 1965, Flippen continued acting, usually using a wheelchair, such as in his comeback role in a 1966 episode of The Virginian, and his 1967 guest appearance in Ironside (season one, \\"A Very Cool Hot Car\\"). Personal life He was married for 25 years to screenwriter Ruth Brooks Flippen. While filming Cat Ballou in 1965, he had to have one of his legs amputated due to a serious infection, originally resulting from a minor scrape with a car door, and likely complicated by his diabetes.J.C. Flippen profile, Encyclopedia of Arkansas, encyclopediaofarkansas.net; accessed March 26, 2017. Flippen finished his scenes in that film in great pain, and after the amputation, he took a short period of recuperation and healing, then returned to work, from that period forward taking roles that did not hide his disability. Death Flippen died February 3, 1971, aged 71, during surgery for an aneurysm of an artery, one month before his 72nd birthday. He was interred in a crypt in the Corridor of Memories section at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery.

Hinton also taught at the University of California, San Diego, published books and magazine articles on marine biology, and worked as a calligrapher and artist. Biography Sam Hinton was born March 31, 1917 in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He was raised largely in Crockett, Texas,McKinley Lawless, Ray, Folksingers and Folksongs in America: A Handbook of Biography, Bibliography, and Discography, (Duell, Sloan and Pearce, 1960), pg. 115 and studied zoology for two years at Texas A&M;,Stambler, Irwin Stambler Encyclopedia of Folk, Country and Western Music (Grelun Landon), pg. 134. helping to finance his education via singing appearances. Leaving college, he moved to Washington D.C. to stay with his parents, where he worked as a window decorator for a department store and did scientific illustration for the Smithsonian in the evenings. While in Washington he and his two sisters Ann and Nell formed a semi-professional singing group called \\"The Texas Trio,\\" and performed locally. In 1937 the group visited New York City to win a Major Bowes' Amateur Hour competition, at which time he was invited to join the travelling Bowes troupe as a single act.Stambler, Irwin Stambler Encyclopedia of Folk, Country and Western Music (Grelun Landon), pg. 34. Hinton left school to tour the country with the troupe, finally settling in Los Angeles three years later, where he enrolled at UCLA to study marine biology, and met his wife, Leslie. During his stay in Los Angeles, he landed a role in the musical comedy Meet the People alongside then-unknowns including Virginia O'Brien, Nanette Fabray, and Doodles Weaver.Stambler, Irwin Stambler Encyclopedia of Folk, Country and Western Music (Grelun Landon), pg. 135.

In 1965, Hinton transitioned to the University of California at San Diego as Assistant Director, Relations with Schools, and in 1967 he became Associate Director. Despite his professional duties, he has continued performing throughout his life. In 1947 Hinton recorded 56 songs, including \\"Buffalo Boy\\" and the \\"Barnyard Song\\" for the Library of Congress. His first commercial recording, \\"Old Man Atom\\" (by Vern Partlow) followed on Columbia in 1950.Cohen, Ronald D.

Over the next several years he also made a number of singles for Decca's Children's Series, and in 1952 issued his first LP, Folk Songs of California. After three more efforts for Decca – 1955's Singing Across the Land, 1956's A Family Tree of Folk Songs and 1957's The Real McCoy – he moved to FolkwaysSam Hinton recordings at Folkways for 1961's Whoever Shall Have Some Good Peanuts and 1967's The Wandering Folksong. None of Hinton's musical projects distracted him from his academic duties, however, and from 1948 onward he taught UCSD courses in biology and folklore; for the National Education Television network, he also hosted a 13-part series on folk music, and for several years even wrote a regular newspaper column, \\"The Ocean World,\\" for the San Diego Union.

He is considered one of the most influential contemporary creators of the Surrealist circle. Information on his work In the early period of his work, the atmosphere of his works, considered symbolic, is saturated with drama and sadness. Painful deformed human figures and mythical creatures are shown against a surreal background landscapes . This series of works was defined by the author as non-dreams. In the next period Kukowski definitely brightened his palette. The dominant theme of his paintings became nudes, but even here the mark of disintegration and the passage of time is felt. These works have been painted in the form of frescoes destroyed by time and revealing completely different images under them. In the next phase of the work, Kukowski referred to his first works, but despite his lighter tones his paintings became more and more ironic and provocative. The artist also cooperates with musicians and avant-garde artists. His works are used for illustrative forms related to contemporary music (he collaborates with the Theater of Creation and the alternative formation of Peter Murphy - Dali's Car - a record - \\"InGladAloneness\\".

It contains the familiar click beetles, fireflies, and soldier beetles and their relatives. Certain clusters of families within the superfamily are more strongly related to one another; for example, the Elateridae have close ties to the Cerophytidae, Eucnemidae, and Throscidae, and some of these beetles can also \\"click\\". Likewise, the Lampyridae are most closely related to the Phengodidae and Rhagophthalmidae; most members of these families are also bioluminescent, at least as larvae. This group of families also includes many taxa whose females are larviform, though this is also known from a few other families in the superfamily. The validity and relationships of some families, such as Podabrocephalidae are not fully resolved. The family Rhinorhipidae has recently been removed to its own superfamily, with evidence that it is a basal taxon within Elateriformia dating to an Upper Triassic/Lower Jurassic split from other extant beetle lineages.Kusy, D., Motyka, M., Andujar, C. et al.

The building, which stood at 1000 S. Industrial Blvd, or the intersection of Industrial Boulevard and Cadiz Street (near the I-30/I-35E Interchange), had a seating capacity of approximately 4,500. Early history Aerial view of original octagonal Sportatorium, 11 March 1949 Built in 1934 by the Cox Fence Company, the original Dallas Sportatorium was constructed in the shape of an octagon, and seated approximately 10,000. Its inaugural wrestling event, promoted by Burt Willoughby, took place on December 9, 1935. Willoughby promoted wrestling at the Sportatorium until 1940, when the company was bought out by its former concessions manager, Ed McLemore. From 1948 until 1966, the Sportatorium was also the site of the Big D Jamboree, a weekly country music showcase similar in format to the Grand Ole Opry and Louisiana Hayride; portions of the Jamboree were broadcast nationally on the CBS Radio Network. The Sportatorium was partially destroyed by fire on May 1, 1953, in what was rumored to be an act of arson by a rival wrestling promoter. It was quickly rebuilt at the same location as a rectangular venue (with a modified octagonal seating configuration similar to the original), and reopened on September 22 of that year, billed at the time as The Million-Dollar Sportatorium. The arena also held boxing events and concerts featuring up-and-coming rock stars over the years, very much in the same manner as its Los Angeles counterpart, the Grand Olympic Auditorium, did during this time frame. In late 1966, McLemore formed a partnership with wrestler Jack Adkisson, who was known in the ring as Fritz Von Erich and bought the Dallas/Fort Worth Wrestling Office, breaking away from Paul Boesch and the Houston Wrestling Office. In January 1968, McLemore started suffering a series of heart attacks and was no longer able to attend to the company's day-to-day business; he died on January 9, 1969, leaving Adkisson in charge. Adkisson's promotion, which became known in the early 1980s as World Class Championship Wrestling and featured his sons as its top stars, was the most famous and successful wrestling federation to run regularly at the Dallas Sportatorium. WCCW ring announcer Gene Summers and referee David Manning at a live event in the Sportatorium, 1981. The arena was configured with several ring aisles with the majority of the seats (mostly bleachers) set up on the east, south and west portions of the building. The north side of the building, best known as \\"Section D\\", was used mostly for a small stage and media area for cameras and reporters, but at least 10 rows of seats were also set up between the main stage/ring and the wall. A United States flag was displayed on the wall of section D for most of the arena's existence, and was changed once when the 48-star U.S. flag was replaced with a 50-star U.S. flag in 1960. The flag was moved to the section C area in 1987, then later above section I in the 1990s when the arena was refurbished for the Global Wrestling Federation. During wrestling matches, the heel wrestlers came out of the northwest aisle, between sections B & C, while the babyfaces came out of the aisle on the southwest corner, or sections J & A. A broadcast studio was set up adjacent to the heel's locker room area; and an overhead section was later added for wrestling announcers to call the match. On the Industrial Blvd side of the arena was the offices of Big Time Wrestling/World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW). Jack Adkisson and his sons each shared office space in the arena. Others like David Manning, Gary Hart, Ken Mantell, Percy Pringle, Skandor Akbar and Chris Adams would also occupy the front offices of the arena. Eric Embry, who was the Sportatorium's lead booker, lived inside the arena for a time in 1989. Decline After WCCW folded in 1990 due to dwindling attendance, fundamental changes in the wrestling industry and tragedies involving a number of its top stars (including all but one of the Von Erichs, Gino Hernandez, and Bruiser Brody), the Sportatorium served as home base for the Global Wrestling Federation from 1991 to 1994 (billing itself for a time as the GlobalDome). Following the GWF's demise, a succession of smaller promotions (including the NWA between 1995 and 1996) attempted to hold shows in the building, each of them running out of money and closing their doors after only a short time. However, it did gain one last bit of notoriety in March 1992 when Dallas-based Southwest Airlines held an arm- wrestling match between chairman Herb Kelleher and Kurt Herwald, chairman of Stevens Aviation, resulting from controversy over Southwest's use of the slogan \\"Just Plane Smart\\" (Stevens claimed that it infringed on its own \\"Plane Smart\\" slogan). The match was a publicity stunt designed to raise funds for charity. The Sportatorium fell into disuse in the late 1990s when local independent wrestling promotions, by now drawing crowds only in the low hundreds, elected to run their shows in dance halls and other smaller venues instead. In addition, the aging arena was seriously dilapidated by this time, was out of compliance with local building codes, and was often used as a shelter by homeless people who entered the building illegally. In late December 2001 a fire started inside the building. The flames quickly spread and caused major damage to the arena's upstairs offices. The fire proved to be the coup de grâce for the Sportatorium, its long-rumored demolition finally taking place in the spring of 2003. Before its implosion, Kevin Von Erich took off a bench-seat and a few items from the Sportatorium as souvenirs. Kevin took one final tour of the historic arena, which was featured in its famed DVD documentary Heroes of World Class, released in 2006. Exactly 10 years after the death of Kerry Von Erich, February 18, 2003, the \\"World Famous Sportatorium\\" Main Entrance sign was saved from demolition by wrestling announcer Doyle King, who retains possession of it to this day. It has been on display at several local wrestling reunions and some local Dallas Fort Worth wrestling events. Although it had a reputation for being uncomfortable and unsanitary (having inadequate heating and cooling facilities, rodent infestation problems and apparently a large chamber or pit in the foundation), the Dallas Sportatorium is nonetheless still remembered fondly for its intimate atmosphere, and is considered one of pro wrestling's most legendary venues. The land that had been occupied by the arena is slated to be a part of the new Trinity River Project, which has led to the renaming of Industrial Boulevard to Riverfront Boulevard.

After playing with Blood, Sweat & Tears, he worked with drummer Billy Cobham, then with trumpeter Miles Davis from 1981 to 1983 and again in 1985. He then began a solo career, releasing more than a dozen albums. Stern was named Best Jazz Guitarist of 1993 by Guitar Player magazine. At the Festival International de Jazz de Montréal in June 2007, he was given the Miles Davis Award, which was created to recognize internationally acclaimed jazz artists whose work has contributed significantly to the renewal of the genre. In 2009 Stern was listed on Down Beats list of 75 best jazz guitarists of all time. He received Guitar Player magazine's Certified Legend Award on January 21, 2012. Personal life Stern was born Michael Sedgwick in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Helen Stern (née Helen Phillips Burroughs), a sculptor and art patron, and Henry Dwight Sedgwick V. His adoptive stepfather was Philip M. Stern, the son of businessman Edgar B. Stern Sr and philanthropist Edith Rosenwald Stern, and grandson of philanthropist Julius Rosenwald. His sister Holly is the mother of actor Philip Nozuka and singers George Nozuka, Justin Nozuka and Henry Nozuka. His other (half-)sister is actress Kyra Sedgwick. Stern is married to guitarist and vocalist Leni Stern. Career Stern grew up in Washington, D.C., and attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston. When he was twenty-two, he became a member of Blood, Sweat & Tears and spent three years with the band, appearing on the albums More Than Ever and Brand New Day. In 1979, he joined Billy Cobham's fusion band. Two years later he joined Miles Davis, making his public debut in 1981, a performance recorded on the album We Want Miles. He remained with Davis through 1983 until he was replaced by guitarist John Scofield. At the time, Stern was a heavy drinker and heroin user. In a 2009 interview, he said, \\"If Miles wants to put you in a rehab, you know you've got something wrong\\". From 1983 to 1984 he toured with Jaco Pastorius (a period also characterized by heavy drug use) and in 1985 returned to tour with Davis. Stern and his wife were in rehabilitation; they were also helped by Michael Brecker and others. Mike Stern at the Liri Blues Festival, Italy, in 1998 Stern's solo debut, Upside Downside, with Jaco Pastorius, David Sanborn, and Bob Berg, was released on Atlantic Records in 1986. From 1986 through 1988, he was a member of Michael Brecker's quintet, appearing on Don't Try This at Home. His second Atlantic album, 1988's Time in Place, featured Peter Erskine on drums, Jim Beard on keyboards, Jeff Andrews on bass, Don Alias on percussion and Don Grolnick on organ. His next album, Jigsaw, was produced by guitarist Steve Khan and included the song \\"Chief\\", Stern's tribute to Miles Davis. In 1989, Stern formed a touring group with Bob Berg, Dennis Chambers and Lincoln Goines. They remained together through 1992 and are featured on the album Odds or Evens. In 1992, Stern joined a reunited Brecker Brothers Band for two years. His acclaimed 1993 album, Standards (and Other Songs), led to his being named Best Jazz Guitarist of the Year by the readers and critics of Guitar Player. He followed that with 1994's Is What It Is and 1996's Between the Lines, both of which received Grammy Award nominations. In 1997 he released Give and Take, with bassist John Patitucci, drummer Jack DeJohnette, percussionist Don Alias and special guests Michael Brecker and David Sanborn. He won the Orville W. Gibson Award for Best Jazz Guitarist. After fifteen years with Atlantic, Stern signed with ESC Records for the 2004 release of These Times, an eclectic album that included guest appearances by bassist Richard Bona, saxophonist Kenny Garrett and banjoist Béla Fleck. He joined the Heads Up label with the August 2006 release of Who Let the Cats Out? In 2008, he collaborated with the Yellowjackets for their Lifecycle album, contributing two compositions and performing on most of the tracks, and toured with the Yellowjackets for much of 2008 and 2009. In February 2009, in the first of a series of articles celebrating Down Beats 75th anniversary, Stern was named one of the 75 Great Guitarists of all time. In August 2009, Stern released Big Neighborhood, which was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Jazz Album. Stern performing in Munich, 2001 He was presented with Guitar Player magazine's Certified Legend Award on January 21, 2012. This was given to him at the Muriel Anderson All-Star Guitar night, where he performed with Lee Ritenour. Other guitarists who have won the award include Les Paul, Duane Eddy, Dick Dale, Larry Carlton and Tommy Emmanuel. In June of that year, Stern released All Over the Place, featuring trumpeter Randy Brecker, saxophonists Kenny Garrett, Chris Potter, Bob Franceschini and Bob Malach, drummers Dave Weckl, Keith Carlock, Lionel Cordew, Al Foster, Kim Thompson, keyboardist/producer Jim Beard, and Stern's wife, guitarist and vocalist Leni Stern. Acoustic and electric bassist present included Esperanza Spalding, Richard Bona, Victor Wooten, Anthony Jackson, Dave Holland, Tom Kennedy, Will Lee and Victor Bailey. In 2014, Stern toured with guitarist Eric Johnson in the Eclectic Guitar Tour. They recorded an album of the same name. In the summer of 2016, Stern reported serious injuries to his shoulders and right arm after tripping and falling. It ended his European tour, and he had to modify his playing technique to keep performing. In the summer of 2017 he returned to Europe on tour with a new formation called Mike Stern/Randy Brecker Band, featuring Randy Brecker (trumpet), Teymur Phell (bass guitar) and Lenny White (drums). In 2017, Stern recorded \\"Mike Stern: Burn with Stern!\\", a series of jazz guitar instructional videos for TAGAPublishing.com. Equipment An early and important guitar for Stern was a hybrid 1950s/1960s Fender Telecaster, previously owned by Roy Buchanan and Danny Gatton, which was stolen from him in an armed robbery in Boston. This guitar is the basis for a custom-made guitar built by Boston-based luthier Michael Aronson. The Aronson guitar is in turn the basis for the Yamaha PA1511MS, the Mike Stern signature model. The neck position pickup is a Seymour Duncan '59 and it has a Tele Hot Rail in the bridge. Stern uses a pair of Fender '65 Twin Reverb amps or his Yamaha G100-212. Stern's recognizable chorused sound is created in part by a Yamaha SPX-90, split for stereo. His pedal board consists mostly of Boss pedals. He uses two Boss DD-3 digital delays, one of which is set to a long delay time for \\"big, spacey sounds.\\" His distortion pedal is a Boss Distortion DS-1.

The station is the terminus for two railway lines: the Alton Line which runs to Brookwood and on to London Waterloo, and the Mid Hants Watercress Railway which runs to Alresford. The latter once ran through to Winchester but was closed to passengers in February 1973;Body, p.33 it reopened as a heritage line in 1985. Two other routes, both now closed, also served the station – the Meon Valley line to Fareham and the Basingstoke and Alton Light Railway. Services operate along the Alton Line to Brookwood and join the South West Main Line towards London Waterloo. The line was single-tracked as far as Farnham by British Rail in the early 1980s. Platforms There are three platforms in use. South Western Railway use platforms one and two, connected by a footbridge. Platform three is used by the Mid Hants Watercress Railway. History The first station opened by the London and South Western Railway in 1852 was sited on what is now the station car park. It closed when the present station opened in 1865. The London & South Western Railway became part of the Southern Railway during the Grouping of 1923. The line from Woking to Alton was electrified in 1937 and the station passed on to the Southern Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. When Sectorisation was introduced in 1986, the station was served by Network SouthEast, until the privatisation of British Rail in 1997. Location Alton station is located in the local government district of East Hampshire. The station is nowhere near Alton Towers Resort, which is located in the rural village of Alton in Staffordshire, about 185 miles away. Many people trying to reach the resort have mistakenly travelled to this station. Local residents, who have encountered many people trying to find Alton Towers, have put up posters at the station containing directions from the station to the resort by train, with a journey time of approximately 4 hours and 46 minutes. Services Monday to Saturdays there is a half-hourly service to London Waterloo and an hourly service on Sundays, increasing to half-hourly from approximately 1330.

The policy covers 6 provinces (Gansu, Guizhou, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Sichuan and Yunnan), 5 autonomous regions (Guangxi, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Tibet and Xinjiang), and 1 municipality (Chongqing). This region contains 71.4% of mainland China's area, but only 28.8% of its population, as of the end of 2002, and 19.9% of its total economic output, as of 2015.China Statistical Yearbook 2016, National Bureau of Statistics of China  History  Under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, the People's Republic of China began to reform its economy in 1978 by changing from a command economy to a market economy. The coastal regions of eastern China benefited greatly from these reforms, and their economies quickly raced ahead. The western half of China, however, lagged behind severely. In March 1999, General-Secretary Jiang Zemin proposed a developmental strategy for the western region at the Ninth National People's Congress. He would elaborate on the plan in June 1999, during which the phrase great western development was used, marking the start of the policy. Premier Zhu Rongji visited the western region to gather western officials' views of the plan. Consequently, the State Planning Commission drafted an early plan for the proposal before submitting it to the Politburo Standing Committee in November 1999. A Leadership Group for Western China Development (西部地区开发领导小组) was created by the State Council in January 2000, led by Zhu. = Chronicle of Events = * 1999: the \\"Western Development\\" guidelines are clarified * 2000: the \\"Western Development\\" plan begins * 2001: the official website of the \\"Western Development\\" program is launched * 2002: construction of the \\"West- East Gas Pipeline\\" begins * 2003: the policy of \\"Returning Grazing Land to Grassland\\" comes into effect * 2004: the Law on Promoting Western Development is listed on the legislative plan of the 10th National People's Congress * 2005: compulsory education tuition and fees become exempt in western areas * 2006: the Qinghai-Tibet railway begins operation * 2007: the Ministry of Finance invests 280 billion yuan in the west to support key projects * 2009: Formation of the West Triangle Economic Zone Strategy Qinghai–Tibet railway Southern Xinjiang railway The main components of the strategy include the development of infrastructure (transport, hydropower plants, energy, and telecommunications), enticement of foreign investment, increased efforts on ecological protection (such as reforestation), promotion of education, and retention of talent flowing to richer provinces. As of 2006, a total of 1 trillion yuan has been spent building infrastructure in western China. = Transportation = The western development bureau affiliated to the state council released a list of 10 major projects to launch in 2008, with a combined budget of 436 billion yuan (64.12 billion U.S. dollars). These projects included new railway lines connecting Guiyang and Guangzhou, Lanzhou and Chongqing, Kashgar and Hotan in Xinjiang; highways between Wanyuan and Dazhou in Sichuan Province, Shuikou and Duyun in Guizhou Province; airport expansion projects in Chengdu, Chongqing and Xi’an. They also include the building of hydropower stations, coal mines, gas and oil transmission tube lines as well as public utilities projects in western regions. By the end of 2007, China has started 92 key construction projects in western regions, with a total investment of more than 1.3 trillion yuan. The world-known Qinghai- Tibet railway project set a milestone in Tibet's local development. It connected Tibet with central part of China. Tibet is no longer an isolated area that can not reached by railway. = Hydraulic projects = The Big Western Line, a possible element of the South–North Water Transfer Project, is a proposal for diverting water from the upstream sections of six rivers in southwestern China, including the Mekong, the Yarlung Tsangpo and the Salween, to the dry areas of northern China through a system of reservoirs, tunnels and natural rivers.Craig Simmons. \\"Solving the Entire Chinese Water Crisis \\", The Atlanta Journal-Constitution via The Progress Report.

While massive investment has boosted the region’s output, effectively raising the GDP in all western regions, the project failed to achieve its goal of eliminating the economic gap between China’s East and West. From 1999 to 2001, Xinjiang and Guangxi displayed an annual GDP percent increase of as high as 30%. China's western regions have reported an annual average economic growth rate of 10.6% for six years in a row. The combined GDP of the western regions reached 3.33 trillion yuan in 2005, compared with 1.66 trillion yuan in 2000, while net income grew on average 10% for urban residents in the west and 6.8% for rural residents.http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-09/06/content_5055217.htm Initiatives encouraging Chinese from wealthier and more crowded regions of China to move to the less crowded western regions has resulted in population growth in [a few cities], most notably Qinghai with its increase of 12.6%.Goodman, David S.

Goodman. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004. 8-9. Nevertheless, the economic growth rate of China’s East continues to exceed that of the West, causing the western share of domestic product to continue to fall. The West’s contribution to the GDP decreased from 20.88% in 1990 to 17.13% in 2000.Gu Chaolin, ShenJianfa, and Yu Taofang. “Urban and Regional Development.” Developing China’s West: A critical Path to Balanced National Development.

Ed. Y.M. Yeung and ShenJianfa. Hong Kong: The Chinese University Press, 2004.15. Evidence from the China Statistical Yearbook also confirms the increasing economic gap between China’s West and East, indicating that the east-to-west GDP ratio increased from 2.98 in 1980 to 4.33 in 2000. = Foreign Investment = Since the introduction of economic reform and open-door policy in 1978, the western region has been in a disadvantageous economic position because it promises a less lucrative return to the investors than its eastern competitors. Therefore, one of the major objectives of the Open Up the West initiative was to bring in foreign investment by creating a more stable investing environment through infrastructure construction. This was a success for the western development project at some level, for statistics shows a substantial growth in foreign investment in the western regions, from US $1,837.35 million in 1999 to $1,922.19 million in 2001. However, not all areas in the western region shared in this progress. While foreign direct investment in Chongqing grew US $17.56 million between 1999 and 2001 (from US $238.93 million to $256.49 million), foreign investment in Guizhou, Guangxi and Ningxi declined significantly, dropping about USD $19.71, $250.96 million, and $34.54 million respectively.Fan Jie. “Western Development Policy: Changes, Effects and Evaluation.” Developing China’s West: A critical Path to Balanced National Development. Ed. Y.M. Yeung and ShenJianfa. Hong Kong: The Chinese University Press, 2004.100. The situation in Guizhou reveals a particularly pernicious effect of the Western Development Program. Despite the fact that Guizhou received 53.3 billion yuan in infrastructure construction in 2001 alone, more than the total amount given by the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1995-2000), its foreign capital declined from US $40.9 million in 1999 to $29.29 million in 2001, an astonishing 31% decline, reaching its lowest point since 1997.Fan Jie. “Western Development Policy: Changes, Effects and Evaluation.” Developing China’s West: A critical Path to Balanced National Development.

Contrary to what the state had intended, the West-East Electricity Transfer Project in Guizhou only assured the continued increase in foreign investment on the coast, as most of the electricity generated in Guizhou was transmitted to Guangdong. Tim Oakes, associate professor of geography at the University of Colorado at Boulder, argues that the decline of foreign investment in certain western regions is a consequence of Beijing’s attempt to recentralize the province’s economy through mega-projects such as Guizhou’s west-east electricity transfer project.Oakes, Tim. “Building a Southern Dynamo: Guizhou and State Power.” China’s Campaign to “Open Up the West”: National, Provincial-level and Local Perspectives. Ed. David S.G. Goodman. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004. 173. The strengthening of central control over the economy has eroded the trust of foreign investors. In the case of Guizhou, while the Chinese central government intended to attract foreign investment in the power sector through the West-East Electricity Transfer Project, only 5% of foreign investment entered the energy sector. About 75% of Guizhou’s foreign investment was channeled into manufacturing and 15% to real estate development.Oakes, Tim. “Building a Southern Dynamo: Guizhou and State Power.” China’s Campaign to “Open Up the West”: National, Provincial-level and Local Perspectives. Ed. David S.G. Goodman. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004. 169. Because the campaign’s economic program is strongly central planned, the campaign has actually discouraged foreign investment, working against its original intent. = Environmental Protection = Foreseeing significant environmental impacts in the massive infrastructure development program, the state highly publicizes environmental preservation in its campaign to open up the West. Farmland conversion to forest and grassland is the dominant strategy for this effort, targeting specifically the regions crucial to the Yangtze’s protection. In Sichuan, the government aims to protect the 19.23 million hectares of existing forest and plant an additional 2.93 million hectares of new forest to diminish the amount of silt flowing into the Yangtze.McNally, Christopher A.. “Sichuan: Driving Capitalist Development Westward.” China’s Campaign to “Open Up the West”: National, Provincial-level and Local Perspectives. Ed. David S.G. Goodman. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004.123. Around 20,000 mu of farmland was converted in Guizhou in 2001, a key region for Yangtze preservation.Oakes, Tim. “Building a Southern Dynamo: Guizhou and State Power.” China’s Campaign to “Open Up the West”: National, Provincial-level and Local Perspectives. Ed. David S.G. Goodman. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004. 170. In Shaanxi, 571,000 hectares of farmland and 427,000 hectares of wasteland were converted to forest or grass between 1999 and 2002. Another 280,000 hectares of farmland and the same expanse of wasteland were converted in 2003.Vermeer, Eduard B.. “Shaanxi: Building a Future on State Support.” China’s Campaign to “Open Up the West”: National, Provincial-level and Local Perspectives. Ed. David S.G. Goodman. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004.101. China’s environmental program in the west has made China “one of a few countries in the world that have been rapidly increasing their forest cover,” according to David Dollar, director of the World Bank in China.Wasserman, Rogerio. “Can China Be Green by 2020?” BBC News. Web. 11 December. 2009. < http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7972125.stm> Although the project seems to be going successfully, it creates a potential fiscal burden for the government. Massive farmland conversion requires a tremendous amount of funding for resettling the farmers. In addition, to compensate farmers for their loss in agricultural profit, the state has committed to supplying them with grains and funds for planting trees and grass. This results in a prescribed allotment of 60 yuan per mu by the central policy. A further complication is farmer dissatisfaction when the government fails to deliver on its contract, since the local government usually bases compensation on actual production value, resulting in compensation between 20-50 yuan, plus a 300 jin appropriation of grain. Farmers who are temporarily benefiting from the compensation will soon rely on governmental subsidy once the tree-planting project is completed.McNally, Christopher A.. “Sichuan: Driving Capitalist Development Westward.” China’s Campaign to “Open Up the West”: National, Provincial-level and Local Perspectives. Ed. David S.G. Goodman. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004.128. 81,000 tons of grain, 154 million yuan in cash subsidies and 266 million yuan for tree saplings to almost 800,000 farming households have already been spent in Shaanxi.Vermeer, Eduard B.. “Shaanxi: Building a Future on State Support.” China’s Campaign to “Open Up the West”: National, Provincial-level and Local Perspectives. Ed. David S.G. Goodman. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004.101. If the provincial government decides to honor its commitment for another 5–8 years, it will cost a total of 11.7 billion yuan in grain and cash subsidies.Vermeer, Eduard B.. “Shaanxi: Building a Future on State Support.” China’s Campaign to “Open Up the West”: National, Provincial-level and Local Perspectives. Ed. David S.G. Goodman. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004. 101. The heavy financial cost makes the sustainability of the environmental project questionable. Furthermore, while the environmental project is critically emphasized in the campaign, very little has been discussed on the impact of intensified coal extraction, increased thermal plant operation, reservoir inundation, and transportation and transmission line construction, all of which create a more detrimental impact to the environment that the environmental program can compensate for.Oakes, Tim. “Building a Southern Dynamo: Guizhou and State Power.” China’s Campaign to “Open Up the West”: National, Provincial-level and Local Perspectives.

From 1926 to 1934 he taught in Leipzig, but illness and the rise of Fascism – he was declared a half-Jew – made this difficult for him. For surviving the Nazis while managing his illness he was awarded the Franz Liszt Award in 1948. His students include Kurt Hessenberg. His compositions include five symphonies, concertos for violin and for organ, six string quartets, numerous solos and duos for strings and winds with and without piano of which several have been recorded. Raphael also composed organ, piano and choral works. He was also responsible for arranging a performance version of Antonín Dvořák's Cello Concerto in A major (1865) when its piano and cello score was discovered in 1918. He was also an editor of classical and baroque scores for Breitkopf and Härtel, preparing editions of, for example, flute sonatas by Frederick the Great and works by Vivaldi and Johann Sebastian Bach (some of these can be found in the Cornell University Library).

The film takes place in the gang ridden neighborhoods of Los Angeles: late-1980s' South Central Los Angeles, Echo Park, Westlake and East Los Angeles. The film centers on Bob Hodges (Duvall), an experienced Los Angeles Police Department C.R.A.S.H. officer, and his rookie partner, Danny McGavin (Penn), who try to stop the gang violence between the Bloods, the Crips, and Hispanic street gangs. Colors relaunched Hopper as a director 19 years after Easy Rider, and inspired discussion over its depiction of gang life and gang violence. Plot Two white cops, Bob \\"Uncle Bob\\" Hodges, a respected 19-year LAPD officer and Vietnam veteran, and rookie officer Danny McGavin have just been teamed together in the C.R.A.S.H. unit that patrols Northwest L.A., East L.A. and South Central L.A. The older cop is appreciated on the local streets. He is diplomatic on the surface, preaching \\"rapport\\" to gang members to encourage them to offer help when it is truly needed. Uncle Bob recognizes that every action cops take is scrutinized by the people they are trying to help. Hodges explains his view on policing to his young partner with a joke about bulls and cows. Although the pair bond quickly, life lessons are seemingly lost on the aggressive, cavalier McGavin, whose stunts soon bring him notoriety among the gang members and the people, such as attacking a graffiti artist by spraying his eyes with the paint can. McGavin wrecks their first unmarked car during a pursuit. Its replacement is vivid yellow, resulting in McGavin being nicknamed \\"Pac-Man\\" by officers and gang members alike. McGavin has a short lived romance with a waitress named Louisa who, like the offended Hodges, feels the weight of the Pac-Man persona. Amidst the strain of these relationships, the murder of a Bloods gang member escalates tension between two other street gangs. A series of seemingly random incidents culminates with the two partners in the middle of the Crips, Bloods and Hispanic barrio war. The 21st Street Gang, led by a criminal named Frog, attempts to negotiate a peace similar to Hodges and steer clear of the melee. To protect his partner, Hodges unwittingly exposes Frog as his source on the Crips leader Rocket's scheme to kill McGavin. Each group attempts to right the wrongs against their respective crews as police strive to prevent the hit and stand their authority over the fall out. In the end, the unit moves in on the would-be last crew standing—the 21st Street Gang. While arresting Frog, Hodges is fatally wounded by a gunman trying to do the hit on McGavin. With medics en route, McGavin comforts Hodges and breaks down with regret as the elder partner falls into delirium and dies. Sometime later, a more reserved McGavin has a rookie partner, a black cop who grew up in the neighborhood where they patrol and sports an attitude like the \\"Pac-Man\\". McGavin tells him the same joke about the bulls that Hodges taught him, and the younger officer reciprocates in the same way as the young McGavin. The film ends with McGavin considering the cycle as the pair drive on and continue their patrol.

Production The movie was filmed entirely in Los Angeles in 1987. The original script by Richard Di Lello took place in Chicago and was more about drug dealing than gang members. Dennis Hopper ordered changes, so Michael Schiffer was hired and the setting was changed to Los Angeles and the focus of the story became more about the world of gang members. The joke that Hodges tells McGavin regarding the two bulls was lifted from the Pat Conroy novel The Great Santini (which was made into a movie that also starred Duvall) and explains how the character Lt. Col. \\"Bull\\" Meechum got his nickname.P. Conroy,The Great Santini, 1989, pg. 394 Real gang members were hired as guardians as well as actors by producer Robert H. Solo. Two of them were shot during filming. On April 2, 1987, Sean Penn was arrested for punching an extra on the set of this film who was taking photos of him without permission. Penn was sentenced to 33 days in jail for this assault. Soundtrack A soundtrack containing mainly hip hop music was released on April 15, 1988, by Warner Bros. Records. It peaked at 31 on the Billboard 200 and was certified gold on July 12, 1988. Reception The movie received both praise and criticism. The film currently has an 82% \\"Fresh\\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 33 reviews, with the consensus; \\"Colors takes a hard-hitting yet nuanced look at urban gang violence, further elevated by strong performances from a pair of well-matched leads.\\" Janet Maslin of The New York Times stated that it \\"has a superb eye for the poisonous flowering of gang culture amid ghetto life, and an ear to match; along with brilliant cinematography by Haskell Wexler, it's also got a fierce, rollicking sense of motion.\\" Roger Ebert hailed it as \\"a special movie – not just a police thriller, but a movie that has researched gangs and given some thought to what it wants to say about them.\\" The Washington Post's critics, Desson Howe and Hal Hinson were split, with Howe stating that Hopper \\"covers the mayhem with unadorned, documentary immediacy that transcends otherwise formulaic cop-fare\\" and Hinson stating that it \\"must be the least incendiary film about gang life ever made.\\" One of the more negative reviews of the film appeared on the BBC's Ceefax service, on which critic Louise Hart remarked: \\"The main weakness of the film is that it concentrates far less on the street gangs than on the growing relationship between the two cops.\\"BBC \\"Ceefax\\" review (p264) =Box office= The movie earned over $46 million in its domestic release.

The most common symptom is chest pain, often radiating to the left shoulder or angle of the jaw, crushing, central and associated with nausea and sweating. Many people with acute coronary syndromes present with symptoms other than chest pain, particularly, women, older patients, and patients with diabetes mellitus. Acute coronary syndrome is commonly associated with three clinical manifestations, named according to the appearance of the electrocardiogram (ECG): ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI, 30%), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI, 25%), or unstable angina (38%). There can be some variation as to which forms of myocardial infarction (MI) are classified under acute coronary syndrome. ACS should be distinguished from stable angina, which develops during physical activity or stress and resolves at rest. In contrast with stable angina, unstable angina occurs suddenly, often at rest or with minimal exertion, or at lesser degrees of exertion than the individual's previous angina (\\"crescendo angina\\"). New-onset angina is also considered unstable angina, since it suggests a new problem in a coronary artery. Signs and symptoms The cardinal symptom of critically decreased blood flow to the heart is chest pain, experienced as tightness around or over the chest and (often, but not always) radiating to the left arm and the left angle of the jaw. This may be associated with diaphoresis (sweating), nausea and vomiting, as well as shortness of breath. In many cases, the sensation is \\"atypical\\", with pain experienced in different ways or even being completely absent (which is more likely in female patients and those with diabetes). Some may report palpitations, anxiety or a sense of impending doom (angor animi) and a feeling of being acutely ill. The description of the chest discomfort as a pressure has little utility in aiding a diagnosis as it is not specific for ACS. Though ACS is usually associated with coronary thrombosis, it can also be associated with cocaine use. Chest pain with features characteristic of cardiac origin (angina) can also be precipitated by profound anemia, brady- or tachycardia (excessively slow or rapid heart rate), low or high blood pressure, severe aortic valve stenosis (narrowing of the valve at the beginning of the aorta), pulmonary artery hypertension and a number of other conditions. Pathophysiology In those who have ACS, atheroma rupture is most commonly found 60% when compared to atheroma erosion (30%), thus causes the formation of thrombus which block the coronary arteries. Plaque rupture is responsible for 60% in ST elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI) while plaque erosion is responsible for 30% if the STEMI and vice versa for Non ST elevated myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). In plaque rupture, the content of the plaque are lipid rich, collagen poor, with abundant inflammation which is macrophage predominant, and covered with a thin fibrous cap. Meanwhile, in plaque erosion, the plaque is rich with extracellular matrix, proteoglycan, glycoaminoglycan, but without fibrous caps, no inflammatory cells, and no large lipid core. After the coronary arteries are unblocked, there is a risk of reperfusion injury due spreading inflammatory mediators throughout the body. Investigations is still underway on the role of Cyclophilin D in reducing the reperfusion injury. Other causes of acute coronary syndrome include spontaneous coronary artery dissection and myocardial infarction in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease (MINOCA), however these are far less common. Diagnosis Classification of acute coronary syndromes. =Electrocardiogram= In the setting of acute chest pain, the electrocardiogram is the investigation that most reliably distinguishes between various causes. The ECG should be done as early as practicable, including in the ambulance if possible. If this indicates acute heart damage (elevation in the ST segment, new left bundle branch block), treatment for a heart attack in the form of angioplasty or thrombolysis is indicated immediately (see below). In the absence of such changes, it is not possible to immediately distinguish between unstable angina and NSTEMI. =Imaging and blood tests= As it is only one of the many potential causes of chest pain, the patient usually has a number of tests in the emergency department, such as a chest X-ray, blood tests (including myocardial markers such as troponin I or T, and H-FABP and/or a D-dimer if a pulmonary embolism is suspected), and telemetry (monitoring of the heart rhythm). Combination of troponin levels (less than 5 ng/l) with low TIMI scores can help to predict those with low possibility of myocardial infarction and discharge them safely from the emergency department. Coronary CT angiography combined with Troponin levels is also helpful to triage those who are susceptible to ACS. F-fluoride positron emission tomography is also helpful in identifying those with high risk, lipid-rich coronary plaques. =Prediction scores= The ACI-TIPI score can be used to aid diagnosis; using seven variables from the admission record, this score predicts crudely which patients are likely to have myocardial ischemia. For example, according to a randomized controlled trial, males having chest pain with normal or non-diagnostic ECG are at higher risk for having acute coronary syndrome than women. In this study, the sensitivity was 65.2% and specificity was 44%. This particular study had an 8.4% prevalence of acute coronary syndrome, which means the positive predictive value of being a male with chest pain and having coronary syndrome is 9.6% and negative predictive value is 93.2% ( click here to adjust these results for patients at higher or lower risk of acute coronary syndrome). In a second cohort study, exercise electrocardiography was similarly found to be a poor predictor of acute coronary syndrome at follow-up. Of the patients who had a coronary event at 6 years of follow up, 47% had a negative ECG at the start of the study. With an average follow up of 2.21 years the receiver operating characteristic curves gave resting ECG a score of 0.72 and exercise ECG a score of 0.74. There are not only prediction scores for diagnosis of ACS, but also prognosis. Most notably, the GRACE ACS Risk and Mortality score helps diagnose, and based upon that score predicts mortality rate of a given patient. It takes into account both clinical (blood pressure, heart rate, EKG findings) and medical history in its scoring system. Prevention Acute coronary syndrome often reflects a degree of damage to the coronaries by atherosclerosis. Primary prevention of atherosclerosis is controlling the risk factors: healthy eating, exercise, treatment for hypertension and diabetes, avoiding smoking and controlling cholesterol levels; in patients with significant risk factors, aspirin has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. Secondary prevention is discussed in myocardial infarction. After a ban on smoking in all enclosed public places was introduced in Scotland in March 2006, there was a 17% reduction in hospital admissions for acute coronary syndrome. 67% of the decrease occurred in non-smokers. Treatment People with presumed ACS are typically treated with aspirin, clopidogrel or ticagrelor, nitroglycerin, and if the chest discomfort persists morphine. Other analgesics such as nitrous oxide are of unknown benefit. Angiography is recommended in those who have either new ST elevation or a new left or right bundle branch block on their ECG. Unless the person has low oxygen levels additional oxygen does not appear to be useful. =STEMI= If the ECG confirms changes suggestive of myocardial infarction (ST elevations in specific leads, a new left bundle branch block or a true posterior MI pattern), thrombolytics may be administered or primary coronary angioplasty may be performed. In the former, medication is injected that stimulates fibrinolysis, destroying blood clots obstructing the coronary arteries. In the latter, a flexible catheter is passed via the femoral or radial arteries and advanced to the heart to identify blockages in the coronaries. When occlusions are found, they can be intervened upon mechanically with angioplasty and usually stent deployment if a lesion, termed the culprit lesion, is thought to be causing myocardial damage. Data suggest that rapid triage, transfer and treatment is essential. The time frame for door-to-needle thrombolytic administration according to American College of Cardiology (ACC) guidelines should be within 30 minutes, whereas the door-to- balloon Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) time should be less than 90 minutes. It was found that thrombolysis is more likely to be delivered within the established ACC guidelines among patients with STEMI as compared to PCI according to a case control study. =NSTEMI and NSTE-ACS= If the ECG does not show typical changes, the term \\"non-ST segment elevation ACS\\" is applied. The patient may still have suffered a \\"non-ST elevation MI\\" (NSTEMI). The accepted management of unstable angina and acute coronary syndrome is therefore empirical treatment with aspirin, a second platelet inhibitor such as clopidogrel, prasugrel or ticagrelor, and heparin (usually a low-molecular weight heparin), with intravenous nitroglycerin and opioids if the pain persists. The heparin-like drug known as fondaparinux appears to be better than enoxaparin. A blood test is generally performed for cardiac troponins twelve hours after onset of the pain. If this is positive, coronary angiography is typically performed on an urgent basis, as this is highly predictive of a heart attack in the near-future. If the troponin is negative, a treadmill exercise test or a thallium scintigram may be requested. If there is no evidence of ST segment elevation on the electrocardiogram, delaying urgent angioplasty until the next morning is not inferior to doing so immediately. Using statins in the first 14 days after ACS reduces the risk of further ACS. In a cohort study comparing NSTEMI and STEMI, people with NSTEMI had a similar risk of death at one year after PCI as compared to people with STEMI (3.4% vs 4.4%). However, NSTEMI had significantly more \\"major cardiac events\\" (death, myocardial infarction, disabling stroke, or requiring revascularization) at one year (24.0% vs 16.6%). Cocaine-associated ACS should be managed in a manner similar to other patients with acute coronary syndrome except beta blockers should not be used and benzodiazepines should be administered early. Prognosis =TIMI score= The TIMI risk score can identify high risk patients in non-ST segment elevation MI ACS and has been independently validated. = Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) score = Based on a global registry of 102,341 patients, the GRACE score estimates in-hospital, 6 months, 1 year, and 3-year mortality risk after a heart attack. GRACE Score 2.0 Calculator. = Killip class = The Killip classification consists of 4 classes based on clinical symptoms. It predicts 30-day mortality after myocardial infarction. =Biomarkers for diagnosis= The aim of diagnostic markers is to identify patients with ACS even when there is no evidence of heart muscle damage. *Ischemia-Modified Albumin (IMA) – In cases of Ischemia – Albumin undergoes a conformational change and loses its ability to bind transitional metals (copper or cobalt). IMA can be used to assess the proportion of modified albumin in ischemia. Its use is limited to ruling out ischemia rather than a diagnostic test for the occurrence of ischemia. *Myeloperoxidase (MPO) – The levels of circulating MPO, a leukocyte enzyme, elevate early after ACS and can be used as an early marker for the condition. *Glycogen Phosphorylase Isoenzyme BB-(GPBB) is an early marker of cardiac ischemia and is one of three isoenzyme of Glycogen Phosphorylase. *Troponin is a late cardiac marker of ACS =Biomarkers for risk determination= The aim of prognostic markers is to reflect different components of pathophysiology of ACS. For example: *Natriuretic peptide – Both B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal Pro BNP can be applied to predict the risk of death and heart failure following ACS. *Monocyte chemo attractive protein (MCP)-1 – has been shown in a number of studies to identify patients with a higher risk of adverse outcomes after ACS. =Day of admission= Studies have shown that for ACS patients, weekend admission is associated with higher mortality and lower utilization of invasive cardiac procedures, and those who did undergo these interventions had higher rates of mortality and complications than their weekday counterparts. This data leads to the possible conclusion that access to diagnostic/interventional procedures may be contingent upon the day of admission, which may impact mortality. This phenomenon is described as weekend effect.  Valvular heart disease  Valvular heart disease is characterized by damage to or defective in one of the four heart valves: the mitral, aortic, tricuspid or pulmonary. Some types of valvular heart disease include valvular stenosis, vascular prolapse and regurgitation. = Oral manifestations = Oral infections may pose risk during postoperative period of heart valve surgery. Oral health in patients scheduled for heart valve surgery is poorer than in individuals without valve disease. Most of them suffer periodontitis due to high dental plaque scores, reflecting poorer dental hygiene. This situation could favour the appearance of bacteremia following tooth brushing in these individuals. Bacteremia secondary to periodontal infection is known to be one of the primary causes of infectious endocarditis, particularly in patient with heart valve disorders. Therefore, treatment of dental disease should be done prior to performing heart surgery. Periodontal treatment is advised in patients with advanced periodontitis, followed by root planing and ultrasound treatment. Those teeth not amenable to treatment and with poor prognosis should be removed as pre- surgical preventive measures. = Dental management = The two main concerns during dental treatment for people of patient with valvular heart disease are the risk of infective endocarditis and bleeding in anti coagulated patients. Endocarditis is more likely to occur in patients who have previously had endocarditis and those with certain cardiac lesions. Risk of a normally functioning prosthesis being infected after a dental procedure is probably no higher than risk in patient with damaged native valves. However, mortality and morbidity is much higher should prosthesis become infected. Patient with native valve disease can often stop or reduce their anticoagulants, but those with prosthetic valves should not discontinue anticoagulants without cardiological advice. Mechanical mitral valves are prone to thrombosis, which cause emboli if adequate anti-coagulation is not maintained, although short term modification may be possible.  Heart failure  Heart failure (HF) is defined as the incapacity of the heart to function properly, pumping insufficient blood towards the tissues and leading to fluid accumulation within the lungs, liver and peripheral tissues. = Oral manifestations = Most if not all patients with heart failure will be undergoing drug treatments for their condition and these drugs can produce a series of oral manifestation. In this context, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors such as captopril and enalapril can produce burning mouth sensation lichenoid reactions and a loss of taste sensation, while diuretics like furosemide can produce xerostomia. = Dental management = Consultation with the supervising physician is highly advised in order to understand the patient's current condition and the medication prescribed. The patient should be receiving medical care, and heart failure should be compensated. Dental treatment is to be limited to patients who are in stable condition, since these people are at a high risk of developing questionable arrhythmias and even sudden death secondary to cardiopulmonary arrest. Stress and anxiety are to be avoided during the visits, which in turn should be brief (< 30 minutes) and are to be scheduled for the morning sessions. The patient should be seated on the chair in a semi-supine position, with control of body movements (which should be slow), to avoid orthostatic hypotension. In patients who has been administered with digitalis agents (digoxin, methyl-digoxin), the vasoconstrictor dose should be limited to two anaesthetic carpules, since this drug combination can cause arrhythmias. Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) can lead to fluid and sodium retention, and therefore should not be prescribed in patients with heart failure. In emergency (i.e., lung edema), after contacting the emergency service, the patient should be seated with the legs lowered, and receiving nasal oxygen at a rate of 4–6 liters/minute. Sublingual nitroglycerin tablets are indicated (0.4-0.8 mg), and the dose may be repeated every 5 or 10 minutes if blood pressure is maintained.  Arrhythmia  Arrhythmias are variations in normal heart rate due to cardiac rhythm, frequency or contraction disorders. The most common type of cardiac arrhythmia is atrial fibrillation. = Oral manifestations = Many anti-arrhythmic drugs have side effects such as gingival hyperplasia or xerostomia. = Dental management = Consultation with the supervising physician is also advised in order to understand the patient's current condition and the type of arrhythmia involved, as well as the medication prescribed. It must be checked that the patient uses the medication correctly. Stress and anxiety can be reduced with anxiolytics. Short visits in the morning are to be preferred. Patient monitoring, with recording of the pulse, is indicated before treatment. It is very important to limit the use of vasoconstrictor in local anesthesia, with no more than two carpules. The treatment planned should not be too long or complicated. Although modern pacemakers are more resistant to electromagnetic interferences, caution is required when using electrical devices like ultrasound and electric scalpels that might interfere with pacemakers – especially the older models, since such devices developed in the last 30 years are bipolar and are generally not affected by the small electromagnetic fields generated by dental equipment. It is therefore important to know the type of pacemaker, the degree of electromagnetic protection of the generator, and the nature of the arrhythmia. If arrhythmia develops during dental treatment, the procedure should be suspended, oxygen is to be given, and the patient vital signs are to be assessed: body temperature (normal values: 35.5-37oC), pulse (normal values: 60-100 bpm), respiratory frequency (normal values in adults: 14-20 cycles or respirations per minute), blood pressure (normal values: systolic blood pressure under 140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure under 90 mmHg). Sublingual nitrites are to be administered if there is chest pain. The patient should be placed in the Trendelenburg position, with vagal maneuvering where necessary (valsalva maneuver, massage in the carotid pulse region). The dental team should be prepared for basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation and initiation of the emergency procedure for evacuation to a hospital centre, if necessary.

It is situated on the Mediterranean coast, at the mouth of river Besòs, extending to both sides of the estuary although the original settlement with the parish church lies on the left bank of the river, in the northern part of town. Sant Adrià is the smallest municipality of Barcelonès and has close ties with the neighbouring cities of Barcelona, Badalona and Santa Coloma de Gramenet, forming a uniform urban area within Barcelona metropolitan area. The municipality straddles major transportation networks and is served by several modes of public transport. Sant Adrià is currently a town dominated by the service sector, but with a diverse manufacturing sector (especially in the areas of metal-work, chemistry, and construction) consisting mostly of medium-sized companies. Historically, it has experienced several massive migration flows attracted by the important industrialisation of the area during the last century and has been subject of various major urban redevelopments. In 2004, Sant Adrià de Besòs was part of the Universal Forum of Cultures. History The origins of the town are linked to the parish church of Sant Adrià de Besòs, which was referred to in 1012, where in about 1092 a priory of Augustinian monks, dependants of Sant Ruf d'Avinyo, was founded. Saint Olegarius (San José María de Porcioles) came to this priory from 1095 to 1108 before becoming the bishop of Barcelona and, later, the archbishop of Tarragona. In 1127 the priory was moved to Santa Maria de Terrassa. Surrounding this church, upon a small hill fourteen metres high, to the west of the River Besòs, is the nucleus of the original village. Transport Given its proximity to the city of Barcelona, Sant Adrià de Besòs is well served by road, rail and many other forms of public transport, becoming an important part of the transportation network in Barcelona metropolitan area. The city has always been an economically unprivileged town and a really dense area, and it remained indifferent to the establishment and the improvement of public transport around Barcelona for many years, but the recent development in public infrastructures and urban renewals has brought substantial transport improvement, especially in the form of tram services. C-31 highway comes directly from Plaça de les Glòries Catalanes in Barcelona to Mataró and intersects perpendicularly with Ronda del Litoral (B-10 motorway) in the middle of town, forming a major highway interchange, and allowing B-10 to be linked with Ronda de Dalt (B-20 motorway) at Nus de la Trinitat, another major highway interchange in northern Barcelona. Other main roads serving Sant Adrià include the national route N-II parallel to Maresme's coastline and the local road BV-5001 towards Montornès del Vallès and La Roca del Vallès, crossing the northern part of the municipality. Public transportation network is mainly composed of several urban and interurban bus routes that provide a good internal connection within the municipality as well as the connection of the city to other nearby cities within the comarca. Currently, 16 bus routes run through the municipality, 5 of them are local bus routes operated by Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona (TMB) to and from Barcelona, 8 are interurban routes within Barcelonès, and 3 are night routes. With regard to rail transport modes, Trambesòs is the most prominent transport system in Sant Adrià which comprises 7 stops within the municipality served by all its routes, linking the city to the district of Sant Martí up to Parc de la Ciutadella in Barcelona. Maresme Line also runs through the city with Sant Adrià de Besòs railway station as the only stop of the line in town which lies in the eastern part of Sant Adrià and is served by Rodalies de Catalunya commuter rail line R1. Verneda is the only Barcelona Metro station officially located in the municipality, but Artigues – Sant Adrià station is as its name says also meant to serve Sant Adrià de Besòs because although being located in Badalona, it is just a few meters from the city limits. Places of interest * History of Immigration in Catalonia Museum (MhiC): This museum aims to analyse the history of the migratory processes related to Catalonia, mainly from the Iberian Peninsula. It comprises a hall for temporary exhibitions as well as a documentation center, a virtual museum and El Sevillano, a restored passenger railcar used during the 1950s and 1960s by many immigrants to get to Barcelona from southern Spain. * Parish Church of Sant Adrià de Besòs: Built during the 1940s, this church consists of a building with a brick veneer façade, and a large nave which has chapels on each side, a semicircular apse and a dome. The façade is flanked by two towers, of which the highest one is the bell tower. * Air-raid shelter: The air-raid shelter of Francesc Macià Square (RapM) is one of the four public air-raid shelters built during the Spanish Civil War in the city. It is situated under Francesc Macià Square and very close to the former textile factory Industrial Baurier since factories were military targets. This air-raid shelter had capacity for 80 or 100 people and it was finished building in August 1938 but was not closed in Francoist Spain until March 1939. It was reopened on 11 September 2006 after rehabilitation and it was not turned into a museum until 27 January 2008. Currently, the RapM is divided into five exhibition spaces with an entrance hall, and is designed as a teaching tool to think over the Civil War and the post-war in Sant Adrià.http://www.barcelonabombardejada.cat/?q=ca/placeta  Climate  Demography Photo gallery File:Localització de Sant Adrià de Besòs respecte del Barcelonès.svgLocation of the municipality of Sant Adrià de Besòs within the comarca of Barcelonès highlighted in blue.

It was the first grade of polyethylene, produced in 1933 by Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) using a high pressure process via free radical polymerization. Its manufacture employs the same method today. The EPA estimates 5.7% of LDPE (recycling number 4) is recycled in the United States. Despite competition from more modern polymers, LDPE continues to be an important plastic grade. In 2013 the worldwide LDPE market reached a volume of about US$33 billion. Properties LDPE is defined by a density range of 0.917–0.930 g/cm3. It is not reactive at room temperatures, except by strong oxidizing agents, and some solvents cause swelling. It can withstand temperatures of 80 °C continuously and for a short time. Made in translucent or opaque variations, it is quite flexible and tough. LDPE has more branching (on about 2% of the carbon atoms) than HDPE, so its intermolecular forces (instantaneous-dipole induced-dipole attraction) are weaker, its tensile strength is lower, and its resilience is higher. Also, because its molecules are less tightly packed and less crystalline due to the side branches, its density is lower. When exposed to ambient solar radiation the plastic produces two greenhouse gases, methane and ethylene. Due to its low density properties (branching) it breaks down more easily over time, leading to higher surface areas. The production of these trace gases from virgin LDPE increase with surface area/time, with rates at the end of a 212-day incubation of 5.8 nmol g-1 d-1 of methane, 14.5 nmol g-1 d-1 of ethylene, 3.9 nmol g-1 d-1 of ethane and 9.7 nmol g-1 d-1 of propylene. When incubated in air, LDPE emits gases at rates ~2 times and ~76 times higher in comparison to water for methane and ethylene, respectively. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. =Chemical resistance= * Excellent resistance (no attack/no chemical reaction) to dilute and concentrated acids, alcohols, bases and esters * Good resistance (minor attack/very low chemical reactivity) to aldehydes, ketones and vegetable oils * Limited resistance (moderate attack/significant chemical reaction, suitable for short-term use only) to aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, mineral oils, and oxidizing agents * Poor resistance, and not recommended for use with halogenated hydrocarbons.

The term aeronomy was introduced by Sydney Chapman in a letter to the editor of Nature entitled Some Thoughts on Nomenclature in 1946.Sydney Chapman, \\"Some Thoughts on Nomenclature,\\" Nature 157, (1946): 405. Available on-line at: Nature. Studies within the subject also investigate the causes of dissociation or ionization processes. Today the term also includes the science of the corresponding regions of the atmospheres of other planets. Aeronomy is a branch of atmospheric physics. Research in aeronomy requires access to balloons, satellites, and sounding rockets which provide valuable data about this region of the atmosphere. Atmospheric tides dominate the dynamics of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere, essential to understanding the atmosphere as a whole. Other phenomena studied are upper-atmospheric lightning discharges, such as red sprites, sprite halos or blue jets. Atmospheric tides Atmospheric tides are global-scale periodic oscillations of the atmosphere. In many ways they are analogous to ocean tides. Atmospheric tides form an important mechanism for transporting energy input into the lower atmosphere from the upper atmosphere, while dominating the dynamics of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. Therefore, learning about atmospheric tides is essential in understanding the atmosphere as a whole. Modeling and observations of atmospheric tides are needed in order to monitor and predict changes in the Earth's atmosphere.Volland, H., \\"Atmospheric Tidal and Planetary Waves\\", Kluwer Publ., Dordrecht, 1988 Upper-atmospheric lightning Representation of upper-atmospheric lightning and electrical- discharge phenomena Upper-atmospheric lightning or upper-atmospheric discharge are terms sometimes used by researchers to refer to a family of electrical- breakdown phenomena that occur well above the altitudes of normal lightning. The preferred current usage is transient luminous events (TLEs) to refer to the various types of electrical-discharge phenomena induced in the upper atmosphere by tropospheric lightning.

It currently houses the University's School of Law. The house was originally built in 1868 by the architect Alfred Waterhouse and used as his own residence until, in the early 1870s, he moved into an even grander property, Yattendon Court, which he had built in 1867. In the early years of the 20th Century Foxhill was occupied by Rufus Isaacs, 1st Marquess of Reading, who was variously Member of Parliament for Reading, Lord Chief Justice of England, the British ambassador to the United States and Viceroy of India. In 1919 Isaacs sold the lease to Hugo Hirst, founder of the General Electric Company Ltd, who in 1934 became Baron Hirst of Witton. Hirst lived in the house until his death in 1943. Subsequently, the house was used by his daughter, Muriel, and her husband Leslie Carr Gamage until about 1958 when the University gained possession.The International Who's Who, 1958, p 320 Used for a period as student accommodation, Foxhill House was extensively restored between 2003 and 2005, in order to suit its new role as the home of the School of Law. In 2007 the courtyard of the building was refurbished with a grant from PriceWaterhouseCoopers in memory of Edwin Waterhouse, who was both a co- founder of that company and the brother of the building's architect.

Chicago Shakespeare Theater (CST) is a non-profit, professional theater company located at Navy Pier in Chicago, Illinois. Its more than six hundred annual performances performed 48 weeks of the year include its critically acclaimed Shakespeare series, its World's Stage touring productions, and youth education and family oriented programming. The theater had garnered 77 Joseph Jefferson awards and three Laurence Olivier Awards. In 2008, it was the winner of the Regional Theatre Tony Award. Founded in 1986 in a pub, in 1999 the CST moved to a purpose built seven-story theater complex on Navy Pier, where it has a main 500 seat space called the Courtyard, and the 200 seat Theater Upstairs. In 2017, it expanded on the pier into a connected three-theater-campus with the addition of The Yard, a flexible space that allows for versatile arrangements from 150 seats to 850 seats and from proscenium to in-the-round. Background The company's present artistic director Barbara Gaines founded the theater in 1986, when it began performances on the roof of the Red Lion Pub in the city's Lincoln Park neighborhood. In 1999, the company received permission to build its permanent home: a two-venue facility at Navy Pier. Productions at the theater include works from the Shakespearean canon as well as other plays and musicals. In addition to its own original productions, the Chicago Shakespeare Theater also hosts touring productions from other theater companies. Chicago Shakespeare Theater is part of Theatre Communications Group (TCG), the Shakespeare Theatre Association of America (STAA) and National Alliance for Musical Theatre (NAMT) and the National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE). History Chicago Shakespeare Theater was founded as the Chicago Shakespeare Workshop by current Artistic Director Barbara Gaines in 1986, a name which was changed a year later to the Chicago Shakespeare Repertory and finally in 1999 to Chicago Shakespeare Theater. It performed its first twelve seasons in residency at the Ruth Page Theater, where it performed titles ranging from better-known Shakespeare plays such as Hamlet and King Lear as well as lesser-known titles such as Troilus and Cressida and Timon of Athens. Although the theater was critically lauded for its innovative approach to classic works, it was limited by the age and spatial restrictions of the Ruth Page Theater and began looking for a new performance space in the late 1990s. In 1997, CST announced its plans to move from the Ruth Page to a new facility located at Navy Pier, a place better known for its family attractions and in fact the most popular tourist attraction in the Midwest. The move was accompanied by a public relations blitz, which even involved Mayor Richard M. Daley naming April 23, 1997 Shakespeare Repertory Day. The company began a large-scale capital campaign to finance the move, and opened its 1999-2000 season in its new, state-of-the-art facility. Since then, CST has grown from the third-largest theater company in Chicago to the third-largest in the entire Midwest, at a rate 400% faster than the industry growth trend. Facilities Chicago Shakespeare Theater has, since October 1999, been in residence in a purpose built, seven-story, facility at Chicago's Navy Pier, which houses its box office, administrative offices, and performance venues. The first performance at this facility was Eric Idle reading from his novel, The Road to Mars. The 510-seat Courtyard Theater, which is the primary production venue for CST, features state-of-the-art technology and acoustics together with a versatile thrust stage and deep proscenium, that create a flexible performance space. A second theater, the 200-seat black box \\"Upstairs\\" space, is devoted to smaller but still-popular productions such as The Second City's smash hit, Romeo and Juliet Musical: The People Vs. Friar Laurence, The Man Who Killed Romeo and Juliet.

History Lactuca virosa was used in the 19th century by physicians when opium could not be obtained. It was studied extensively by the Council of the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain in 1911. They discovered two chemicals responsible for the properties of L. virosa; lactucopicrin and lactucin. In the United States, the plant experienced a resurgence in popularity in the 1970s. Today the plant is un- scheduled by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), meaning it is legal to grow, purchase, and own without prescription or licence. \\"Wild Salad\\" has long been known in the world of \\"natural remedies\\" or \\"alternative treatments\\".

Oils and extracts can also be produced from L. virosa. These oils and extracts have sedative properties in rodents. Although the standard definition of lactucarium requires its production from Lactuca virosa, it was recognized that smaller quantities of lactucarium could be produced in a similar way from Lactuca sativa and Lactuca canadensis var. elongata, and even that lettuce- opium obtained from Lactuca serriola or Lactuca quercina was of superior quality. Lactuca virosa contains flavonoids, coumarins, and N-methyl-β- phenethylamine.Holistic Online herb information: Wild Lettuce A variety of other chemical compounds have been isolated from L. virosa.

Its principal founders were Tamarra and Richard James. Most of its practitioners today live in Ontario, but it also has members in Eastern Canada and the United States. The tradition differs from other initiatory Wiccan traditions in its emphasis on preparation of its members for public priesthood. The Odyssean tradition is strongly connected with the Wiccan Church of Canada, a public Wiccan church also founded by the Jameses. Origins and history The Odyssean Tradition of Wicca was founded by Richard and Tamara James in 1979, along with other members of their coven. The name of the tradition was inspired by Homer's Odyssey, and is meant to emphasize a belief in life as a \\"spiritual journey\\". The tradition grew out of the James' creation of the Wiccan Church of Canada, with which the tradition is still very closely associated. While the James’s and their coven members claimed to have had backgrounds in Gardnerian Wicca, Alexandrian Wicca, and Continental Wicca, these claims were never substantiated—the general consensus of the British Traditional Wiccan community in Ontario prior to 1987 was that these claims had no substance whatsoever. Regardless, those traditions were not ideally suited for the goal of creating a place for public Neopagan worship, nor did any of these reflect the ritual style that the coven (and, by extension, the church) were adopting—with the exception of Pagan Way (an Outer Court system created by Gardnerian initiates) that had a direct influence upon Wiccan Church of Canada liturgy. The Odyssean tradition is a British Traditional-like Eclectic tradition of Wicca—with a public Wiccan priesthood providing religious services for a Neopagan laity. In 1987, the James' purchased much of Gerald Gardner's collection back from Ripleys, this included Ye Bok of Ye Art Magical. It is after this purchase that the James' received valid initiations and elevations into the various traditions and lineages British Traditional Wicca . The Odyssean tradition and the Wiccan Church of Canada reached their apex in 1992—at that time there were four temples (Toronto, Ottawa, Hamilton, and Kitchener-Waterloo) and three proto-temples in Brampton, Oshawa, and Montreal. Currently, the Wiccan Church of Canada has only two temples; the mother temple in Toronto, Ontario and a temple in Hamilton, Ontario . While the influence of the Wiccan Church of Canada has declined over the past decade, the indirect influence of the Odyssean tradition has grown. Because the WCC is a public Modern Pagan church, and because many members of the laity, many neophytes, and many initiates step away from the WCC to follow their path elsewhere. There are more former members of the WCC laity and more retired neophytes and initiates of the Odyssean tradition than there are active initiates. Many of these retired Odysseans have gone on to found their own covens and traditions that are based upon Odyssean practices. Many of the other Wiccan churches that exist in Canada, and to some extent the United States, have drawn upon Odyssean sources and retired Odysseans. Prior to 1987, an Odyssean initiate who had been elevated into the High Priesthood would be autonomous of both the tradition's founders and of the WCC. That meant that they could initiate and/or elevate their students up to the highest degree (3rd Degree) without requiring approval from the other High Priesthood of the tradition. For those initiated after 1987, these initiates would have to retain active status—they must perform a minimal level of religious services (public rituals and public classes) to one of the temples of the Wiccan Church of Canada—for them to even bring a student before the Odyssean Priesthood Council. The Odyssean Priesthood Council is open to all initiates who currently have active status and it is only after obtaining the approval of the Council that an initiate may initiate or elevate their student. If an initiate fails to perform the minimum amount of religious services to one of the Wiccan Church of Canada temples, their status will be downgraded to inactive. An Odyssean initiate who has been inactive for more than one year and one day can be reclassified by the High Priesthood of the tradition as retired. A retired Odyssean initiate can only return to active status with the permission of the High Priesthood of the tradition. Therefore, while the Odyssean tradition and the WCC were separate during the foundation years of the church, it has been the practice for the past twenty years that the Odyssean tradition and the Wiccan Church of Canada are firmly linked one to the other. Practices Beyond the emphasis on public ministry, the Odyssean tradition is characterized by the following: it is an Eclectic tradition in its origins that has a strong British Traditional Wicca style to its forms of organization and initiation; although it emulates British Traditional the tradition's approach to ritual is more flexible and may often be less structured than many British Traditional Wiccans would be comfortable with; the tradition rejects the concepts of Neopagan monism and Neopagan monotheism; the tradition does accept the base- line Wiccan concept of Neopagan duotheism but does encourage students and seekers alike to choose to affiliate with a particular Pagan pantheon and encourages the devotion to a deity (or group of deities) . The Odyssean training system is remarked upon as being notably rigorous, which can be observed in the Wiccan Church of Canada weekly classes. These classes comprise the basic body of knowledge considered necessary by Odysseans, and can span upwards of 150 hours of class time or more. Completion of these classes (which includes the student completing the homework exercises assigned) is often considered a minimum requirement by Initiates before they accept a person as a new student. Ranks and degrees *Dedication is a ceremony performed by Odysseans for those individuals who wish to confirm themselves to a Neopagan (not necessarily Odyssean) path, and to worship of the Old Gods. *Neophyting is a \\"pre-degree\\" marking the candidate's commitment to a study of the tradition. Although not an Initiate of the tradition, a Neophyte student is oathbound. It is typically awarded after one to two years of study with a private teacher, which in turn takes place after completion of a year-long cycle of public classes. *First Degree Initiation is the rite of ordination within the Odyssean tradition. A first degree initiate is a priest or priestess and a member of the tradition. Among Odysseans, this is only awarded with the consent of a council composed of members of the tradition's active priesthood. It typically takes three to five years of study after Neophyting. It indicates competency in the demands of public priesthood, including \\"leading ritual, teaching, counselling [and] handling crises.\\". *Second Degree Initiation represents an elevation to \\"High Priesthood\\". It is given to those who, in addition to work assigned, have been running a coven or student group successfully for at least a year and trained at least one student through to the first degree level. The time required for elevation to this degree is variable, and many first degree initiates do not actively pursue further training, but for those who do it generally takes five to ten years after initiation. *Third Degree Initiation is rarely awarded, as it is only given to those people who have made a major contribution to the Neopagan community. Relationship with other traditions As mentioned above, Odyssean Wicca was inspired at least in part by the Gardnerian, Alexandrian, Continental, and Blue Star traditions. Despite the first part of its name, like all forms of Wicca, Odyssean Wicca has no connection to the modern religion of Hellenismos, which is based on the worship of the Greek Gods of antiquity. Blue Star Wicca does have a special relationship to the Odyssean tradition, as a \\"sister\\" or \\"cousin\\" tradition. The Dymond line of Alexandrian Wicca also has a unique relationship with the Odyssean tradition and the Wiccan Church of Canada. Because the Odyssean tradition has been created from the known published material (circa 1979) of Gardnerian Wicca and Alexandrian Wicca a greater exposure to the ritual style of other Wiccan and Modern Pagan traditions is offered to Odyssean laity, neophytes, and initiates through the Wiccan Church of Canada . Temples and Covens There are currently two temples in Canada, one based in Toronto and the other in Hamilton. Within the United States, there is a Pagan temple in Connecticut, the Panthean Temple.

Biography Alderete was born in Los Angeles, California the fourth of five children. In the late 1970s, the family moved to the Bay Area. Son of the late civil rights activist Angel Manuel Alderete, he was exposed to jazz music on a weekly basis by his father, who often played it around the Alderete household. Juan decided to pick up the bass after he and his friends decided to start a band. Other early influences included his brother's progressive rock albums, which included bands such as Yes, Rush, King Crimson, etc. He started learning the basics of the bass guitar when he was 16, and was influenced by such players as Jaco Pastorius, Geddy Lee, and Stanley Clarke. Some of his other influences include Jamaladeen Tacuma and John Entwistle, the bass player for the Who. His fascination with the bass guitar revolved around it being a somewhat \\"underappreciated\\" instrument at the time. Alderete enrolled in Musicians Institute in Hollywood (Los Angeles, CA). He enjoyed his time in the school, explaining that he was able to learn techniques and styles that he had never even considered prior to his enrollment. Alderete and fellow student Paul Gilbert started their musical relationship during an audition that Alderete held to find a drummer. Alderete showed up at the audition, bringing a Musician's Institute student and drum-playing friend named Bill Lescohier. Although Lescohier was turned down for the part, Gilbert was impressed with Alderete's bass playing; the two quickly sought to form a speed metal band that would incorporate Gilbert's advanced neoclassical metal guitar technique with Alderete's solid bass lines. To complete the band, Harry Gschoesser joined to fill the drummer position, and Jeff Martin became the vocalist; the group named themselves Racer X (a title that Lescohier had suggested). With this lineup, the band released their debut album, Street Lethal, in 1986. Alderete has been recording with Racer X ever since (note: there was a ten-year hiatus starting from 1989), and their latest album was released in 2002, titled Getting Heavier. Alderete is credited as John Alderete on all Racer X albums. However, four years after the creation of the band, Gilbert left Racer X to form the band Mr. Big. The remaining members of Racer X decided to stay active in music, although they went their separate ways. For the next ten years, Alderete would be involved in several different bands (including The Scream, DC-10, Big Sir, and Distortion Felix) as well as becoming an instructor at Musicians Institute. Not long after, he released his first instructional video on bass techniques and modulation. Although Extreme Volume II: Live was released in 1992, Racer X was not actually reunited. That year, Paul Gilbert was touring with Mr. Big, and Alderete was recording with a hard rock band called The Scream. In actuality, the album was just a compilation of songs that were recorded in concerts before the hiatus. However, around 1999, Alderete got a telephone call from Paul Gilbert, who asked if there was any possibility of recording another Racer X album. Juan agreed, and Racer X reunited to record Technical Difficulties, which features new material as well as older songs that were never recorded. In 2003, while working as a radio producer, Alderete received a call from Omar Rodríguez- López of The Mars Volta while on their European tour with an offer to audition for the band: He went on to record Frances The Mute with them in 2004, and has played bass on every Mars Volta album since, as well as a number of solo albums by Omar Rodríguez-López. Since joining the band, he has played at Madison Square Garden and was featured on the front cover of the March 2005 issue of Bass Player Magazine. Aside from The Mars Volta, Alderete has been invested in his own musical projects. Big Sir is a group composed of Juan and singer Lisa Papineau that has released four albums. Vato Negro is a group with a revolving door of musicians; originally a duo of Alderete and drummer Matt Sherrod, it has since featured Deantoni Parks, Omar Rodriguez-López, and Jon Theodore in various lineups. Alderete has played shows with both groups in 2010, in California and Fuji Rock Festival in Japan. In addition, Alderete co- produced the film The Sentimental Engine Slayer with Rodríguez-López and former Mars Volta bandmate Paul Hinojos. After The Mars Volta broke up in 2013, Alderete joined vocalist Cedric-Bixler Zavala in his new band, Zavalaz, and later became the touring bassist for Deltron 3030. Juan also runs a website dedicated to showcasing effects pedals and other musical gear called PedalsAndEffects.com. Alderete also laid down the bass line for the late rapper and singer Lil Peep on his 2017 single \\"Benz Truck\\". On November 5, 2017. Alderete filled in bass for Marilyn Manson at the Ozzfest Meets Knotfest festival, replacing longtime bassist Jeordie White, a.k.a. Twiggy Ramirez. He has been Manson's bass player on tour since. Personal life Alderete lives in Los Angeles with his wife, Anne. On May 1, 2007, Alderete announced that he had been diagnosed with polycythemia vera, a rare blood disease. However he also mentioned that he is feeling fine, will experience no side effects from the medication, and will continue to play music. Since discovering his condition, Alderete had agreed to become a spokesman for the MPD Foundation. On January 13, 2020, Alderete sustained a serious brain injury as a result of a bicycle accident near his home. Despite wearing protective equipment, he was in a coma for almost 4 weeks. As of March 25th, he is conscious and aware and is recovering at a rehabilitation facility. His wife, Anne, posts regular updates to his social media pages. Technique and equipment =Playing style= Influenced by players like Jaco Pastorius, Alderete's main playing technique is to use the \\"standard\\" fingers to pluck the strings with his right hand (two fingers: index and middle). He occasionally uses Dunlop Gel picks, as well as his signature picks. He is also known to use two-handed tapping techniques and slapping/popping, which was influenced by Louis Johnson, the bass player for the American funk and R&B; band The Brothers Johnson. Alderete also cites Dr. Dre and Kool Keith of the hip hop group Ultramagnetic MCs as influences. While the two didn't formally play bass, Alderete looks to their bass lines for influence. =Bass guitars= * 1971 Fretless Fender Precision Bass (his main bass guitar on Frances the Mute) * 1973 Fender Precision Bass * 1977 Fender Jazz Bass * 1986 Fender Jazz Bass * 1964 Fender Jazz Bass (recently with flatwound strings) * Fender Geddy Lee Jazz bass guitars The Laklands that Alderete had on tour are: *a white Darryl Jones Signature *a black custom fretless *a red Bob Glaub signature Lakland had made Alderete a bass guitar that if popular, would become a signature model, assumed to be based on his modified 70's fretless Fender Jazz that he used during the Frances the Mute tour. *Darryl Jones model body *Fretless neck with painted lines *Volume/Volume/Tone.

In RSVP, a sequence of stimuli are shown to an observer at one location in their visual field. The observer is instructed to report one of these stimuli - the target - which has a feature that differentiates it from the rest of the stream. For instance, observers may see a sequence of stimuli consisting of grey letters with the exception of one red letter. They are told to report the red letter. People make errors in this task in the form of reports of stimuli that occurred before or after the target. The position in time of the letter they report, relative to the target, is an estimate of the timing of visual selection on that trial. Peripheral reading Peripheral reading is vital to those suffering from central field loss, which is most commonly seen in the elderly. Factors which might limit one's peripheral reading rate include acuity, crowding, and eye movements. Many find difficulty making the correct eye movements for peripheral reading, but the dependence on eye movements can be minimized through the presentation format of RSVP.

Wajid Ali Shah met her in his palace. She rebelled against the British East India Company during the Indian Rebellion of 1857. She finally found asylum in Nepal where she died in 1879. After her husband had been exiled to Calcutta, she took charge of the affairs in the state of Awadh and seized control of Lucknow. She organised an army of women and placed Uda Devi as its commander. She actively took part in the revolt of 1857 against the Doctrine of Lapse under which Dalhousie wanted her to surrender Lucknow. She gave stiff resistance. But after the fall of Lucknow she escaped to Kathmandu. She was a very brave woman and such bravery in a male-dominated society was unprecedented. She made her son, Prince Birjis Qadr, the Wali (ruler) of Awadh; However, she was forced to abandon this role after a short reign. \\"Pasi respondents first documented the story of Begum Hazrat Mahal in print in the 1971 Census records. Though the name of Uda Devi was not mentioned, the respondents mentioned that, in the war of 1857, a Pasi Palton (a platoon of Pasis) rescued Begum Hazrat Mahal from imprisonment by the British (Census of India 1971: 2). It was only later that the story of Uda Devi came to be incorporated into the narrative. After 1990, the story found organisational support for its transmission and celebration with the formation of the Virangana Uda Devi Smarak Sansthan.\\" Biography Mahal's name was Muhammadi Khanum, and she was born at Faizabad, Awadh, India. She was a courtesan by profession and had been taken into the royal harem as a khawasin after being sold by her parents, then to Royal agents, and later promoted to a pari,Michael Edwardes (1975) Red Year.

She became a begum after being accepted as a royal concubine of the King of Awadh,Christopher Hibbert (1980) The Great Mutiny, Harmondsworth: Penguin; p. 371 and the title 'Hazrat Mahal' was bestowed on her after the birth of their son, Birjis Qadra.

One of the principal complaints of Begum Hazrat Mahal was that the East India Company had casually demolished Temples and mosques just to make way for roads.William Dalrymple The Last Mughal; the fall of a dynasty: Delhi, 1857, Viking Penguin, 2006, p. 69 In a proclamation issued during the final days of the revolt, she mocked the British claim to allow freedom of worship: When the forces under the command of the British re-captured Lucknow and most of Oudh, she was forced to retreat. Hazrat Mahal worked in association with Nana Saheb, but later joined the Maulavi of Faizabad in the attack on Shahjahanpur. =Later life= Ultimately, she had to retreat to Nepal, where she was initially refused asylum by the Rana prime minister Jang Bahadur,Hibbert (1980); pp. 374–375 but was later allowed to stay.Hibbert (1980); pp. 386–387 She died there in 1879 and was buried in a nameless grave in the grounds of Kathmandu's Jama Masjid.

The park has been used for Ramlilas and bonfires during Dusshera, as well as Lucknow Mahotsava (Lucknow Exposition). On 10 May 1984, the Government of India issued a commemorative stamp in honour of Mahal. The first day cover was designed by C.R. Pakrashi, and the cancellation was done by Alka Sharma. 15,00,000 stamps were issued. The Ministry of Minority Affairs, Government of India has started the Begum Hazrat Mahal National Scholarship for Meritorious Girls belonging to minority communities in India. This scholarship is implemented through the Maulana Azad Education Foundation.

Linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) is a substantially linear polymer (polyethylene), with significant numbers of short branches, commonly made by copolymerization of ethylene with longer-chain olefins. Linear low-density polyethylene differs structurally from conventional low-density polyethylene (LDPE) because of the absence of long chain branching. The linearity of LLDPE results from the different manufacturing processes of LLDPE and LDPE. In general, LLDPE is produced at lower temperatures and pressures by copolymerization of ethylene and such higher alpha-olefins as butene, hexene, or octene. The copolymerization process produces an LLDPE polymer that has a narrower molecular weight distribution than conventional LDPE and in combination with the linear structure, significantly different rheological properties.  Production and properties  The production of LLDPE is initiated by transition metal catalysts, particularly Ziegler or Philips type of catalyst. The actual polymerization process can be done either in solution phase or in gas phase reactors. Usually, octene is the comonomer in solution phase while butene and hexene are copolymerized with ethylene in a gas phase reactor. LLDPE has higher tensile strength and higher impact and puncture resistance than does LDPE. It is very flexible and elongates under stress. It can be used to make thinner films, with better environmental stress cracking resistance. It has good resistance to chemicals. It has good electrical properties. However, it is not as easy to process as LDPE, has lower gloss, and narrower range for heat sealing.  Processing  LDPE and LLDPE have unique rheological or melt flow properties. LLDPE is less shear sensitive because of its narrower molecular weight distribution and shorter chain branching. During a shearing process, such as extrusion, LLDPE remains more viscous and, therefore, harder to process than an LDPE of equivalent melt index. The lower shear sensitivity of LLDPE allows for a faster stress relaxation of the polymer chains during extrusion, and, therefore, the physical properties are susceptible to changes in blow-up ratios. In melt extension, LLDPE has lower viscosity at all strain rates. This means it will not strain harden the way LDPE does when elongated. As the deformation rate of the polyethylene increases, LDPE demonstrates a dramatic rise in viscosity because of chain entanglement. This phenomenon is not observed with LLDPE because of the lack of long-chain branching in LLDPE allows the chains to slide by one another upon elongation without becoming entangled. This characteristic is important for film applications because LLDPE films can be downgauged easily while maintaining high strength and toughness. The rheological properties of LLDPE are summarized as \\"stiff in shear\\" and \\"soft in extension\\". LLDPE can be recycled though into other things like trash can liners, lumber, landscaping ties, floor tiles, compost bins, and shipping envelopes  Application  LLDPE has penetrated almost all traditional markets for polyethylene; it is used for plastic bags and sheets (where it allows using lower thickness than comparable LDPE), plastic wrap, stretch wrap, pouches, toys, covers, lids, pipes, buckets and containers, covering of cables, geomembranes,LLDPE Smooth Geomembranes for Landfill & Waste Containment and mainly flexible tubing. In 2013, the world market for LLDPE reached a volume of $40 billion. LLDPE manufactured by using metallocene catalysts is labeled mLLDPE.

The band developed after Agnostic Front's front man Roger Miret would let his younger half-brother Freddy Cricien take the microphone and perform lead vocals during Agnostic Front shows.  History  Madball was founded in 1988 and featured most of Agnostic Front's members. Madball consisted of Agnostic Front's vocalist Roger Miret on bass, Vinnie Stigma on guitar, Will Shepler on drums, and then 12-year-old vocalist Freddy Cricien, Roger Miret's younger half-brother. Madball's first few performances consisted of previously unused Agnostic Front songs. Madball's first release was the Ball of Destruction EP in 1989. After years of playing regional shows in and around the New York area, a second guitarist, Matt Henderson, joined the band. By then, they recorded and released the EP, Droppin' Many Suckers, for Wreck-Age Records. One year later, Roger Miret left the band and was replaced by bass player Jorge \\"Hoya Roc\\" Guerra — a good friend of Freddy Cricien — who was looking for a new band as his band, Dmize, was breaking up. The new incarnation of the band was signed by Roadrunner Records in 1994 and released a pair of full-lengths; Set It Off in 1994 and Demonstrating My Style in 1996. Touring steadily, the band built a sizable fan base outside their hometown. 1995 saw the band participating in the N.Y.H.C. documentary. Extensive interviews were conducted with Freddy as well as a performance on July 29, 1995 at the now-defunct \\"Coney Island High\\". Freddy's brother, Roger, broke several vertebrae in his back at that show, requiring him to be in traction for the better part of a year. Consisting of Cricien, Henderson, Guerra, and new drummer John Lafata (former drummer in Neglect), the band recorded Look My Way, which was released in early 1998. Hold It Down followed two years later. The band announced their dissolution in 2001 but decided to reform in late 2002 with a new line-up featuring Brian \\"Mitts\\" Daniels and Rigg Ross. They began touring and recording at the end of 2002. Since then, Madball has come out with: Best of Madball in 2003, N.Y.H.C. EP (EP) in 2004, Legacy in 2005, and Infiltrate The System in 2007. In 2009, Rigg Ross left to join Skarhead and was replaced by Ben Dussault. Along with bands such as Agnostic Front, Vietnom, Bulldoze, Resistance, H2O and Boston/New York Hip-hop group Special Teamz (Slaine, Ed O.G., Jaysaun, DJ Jayceeoh), they comprise a part of New York's DMS Crew. Vocalist Cricien and bass player Hoya are also in the band Hazen Street, along with members of H2O and Cro-Mags. In 2010, after the departure of the Ferret Records owners from the label, Madball followed them to their new and present label Good Fight Music. In February 2010 Madball signed a deal with Nuclear Blast for the European release of their new studio album, Empire, produced by Erik Rutan. Jay Weinberg, son of E Street Band and Max Weinberg 7 drummer Max Weinberg, joined Madball for the album and for touring. Madball then dismissed Weinberg in September 2010, citing personality conflicts. Weinberg said that he had already quit the group by that time, due to lifestyle issues. Born From Pain drummer Igor Wouters replaced Weinberg for live performances. On March 10, 2014, it was announced the band had begun recording its eighth studio album, Hardcore Lives, which was released in June of that year. In October 2017, it was announced that Brian \\"Mitts\\" Daniels had exited Madball. Madball released their ninth studio album, For the Cause, on June 15, 2018. In January 2019, Madball announced that their touring guitarist, Mike Gurnari, would become an official member.

He rose to be a powerful boss of Palermo's Passo di Rigano family. A prolific heroin trafficker, he was killed in May 1981 by the Corleonesi of Totò Riina in the Second Mafia War who opposed the established Palermo Mafia families of which Inzerillo was one of the main proponents. Early life Inzerillo was born in Palermo. He married Giuseppa Di Maggio, the daughter of his mother’s brother, Rosario Di Maggio – the boss of the Passo di Rigano Mafia family.Arlacchi, Mafia Business, pp. 199-200 Through a string of marriages the Inzerillos were related to the Di Maggio and Spatola families in Palermo and the Gambinos in New York.Sterling, Octopus, pp. 199-200. He had two sons, Giuseppe and Giovanni. Inzerillo was a close ally of Stefano Bontade and Gaetano Badalamenti and a relative of the New York City Mafia boss Carlo Gambino. He became a member of the Sicilian Mafia Commission in 1978 succeeding his uncle Rosario Di Maggio, and formed a strong alliance with Bontade against the growing power of Totò Riina and the Corleonesi who were increasingly challenging the established Mafia families of Palermo. Killed in the Second Mafia War Salvatore Inzerillo ordered the killing of prosecuting judge Gaetano Costa who signed the 53 arrest warrants against the Spatola-Inzerillo-Gambino clan and their heroin-trafficking network in May 1980. Costa was murdered on August 6, 1980. Inzerillo acted without asking permission from the Mafia Commission to prove he could commit a murder in rival territory (that of Giuseppe Calò) just as the Corleonesi.Shawcross & Young, Men Of Honour, p. 126Stille, Excellent Cadavers, p. 110 On 11 May 1981, Inzerillo was gunned down in Palermo as he strolled towards his recently acquired bullet-proof car after leaving the house of his mistress. He was rendered almost unrecognizable by a hail of bullets from a machine gun. The firearm used was an AK-47, the same gun that killed Bontade the previous month.Shawcross & Young, Men Of Honour, p. 143 The deaths of these two powerful mafiosi kick-started the Second Mafia War that lasted almost two- years and saw hundreds of mafiosi killed as Totò Riina and the Corleonesi decimated their rivals in order to take over Cosa Nostra by sheer brute force. It is believed Inzerillo was murdered by Pino Greco, one of Riina's most lethal hitmen. At Inzerillo's funeral, his teenage son Giuseppe vowed to avenge his father, and not long afterwards the boy was kidnapped, tortured and killed. A number of informants, including Tommaso Buscetta, said that it was Pino Greco who abducted the youth and shot him through the head, but first hacked his arm off, symbolically removing the arm the youngster had vowed to shoot Riina with.Shawcross & Young, Men Of Honour, p. 144Stille, Excellent Cadavers, p. 305 Santo Inzerillo, the brother of Salvatore, was strangled on 26 May 1981, when he came to a meeting to ask clarifications about the killing of his relatives.

The life-size bronze statue of a Trojan warrior stands in the center of campus and serves as a popular meeting spot, as well as a centerpiece for a number of campus events. It is the most popular unofficial mascot of the university. History The Trojan Shrine was sculpted by Roger Noble Burnham, who used USC football players such as Russ Saunders, Ernie Pinckert, Henry Becker, Larry Stevens and John Ward as visual references for the statue. It was unveiled during the University's 50th Jubilee in 1930. It cost $10,000 to build, after which a $1 surcharge was added onto the season football tickets in order to help offset this cost. The original name suggested for the statue was The Spirit of Troy, but that name went to the school's marching band. On August 17, 2017, during the USC village grand opening, the Hecuba, Queen of Troy statue was unveiled to the public. This large statue serves as the female counterpart to Tommy Trojan and represents the Women of USC. Features Tommy Trojan is located at the core of the campus and often serves as a meeting ground for students and visitors. Many people take pictures with the statue. The Shrine is surrounded by the Bovard Administration Building, Ronald Tutor Campus Center, and Alumni Park. Trousdale Parkway passes next to the statue. USC offers the Tommy Cam, which is a live image of the statue, with daily time-lapse videos. Inscribed on the base of the statue are the five attributes of the ideal Trojan: Faithful, Scholarly, Skillful, Courageous and Ambitious. On the reverse is a plaque bearing a quote by Virgil: \\"Here are provided seats of meditative joy, where shall rise again the destined reign of Troy.\\" Vandalism UCLA football game. USC's cross-town rival UCLA had vandalized Tommy Trojan (often by painting the statue in the UCLA colors of blue and gold) during the week of the annual USC-UCLA football game. To prevent this, university officials now cover the statue during that week to protect it from UCLA vandals. Students also gather for Save Tommy Nite on the night before the game against UCLA. In addition, members of the Trojan Knights maintain an all-night vigil around Tommy Trojan during the rivalry week to further deter would-be vandals. Identity Many people identify Tommy Trojan as the symbol of the university. However, Tommy Trojan is not USC's official mascot; that title belongs to Traveler, a white Andalusian horse. Before Traveler, a real local dog named George Tirebiter served as the unofficial mascot. A statue of the dog is also a feature of the campus.

The band occasionally performs under the name of P Diddler And The Fearsome Foursome. Background and band history The band was formed by singer/guitarist Lenny Lashley, drummer Eric Edmonston, and bassist Mike Gurley in 1996 and developed a following around Massachusetts. In 1997 the band recorded a nine-song demo tape, and in 1999 released their debut album, 22 Songs You'll Never Want To Hear Again! The album instantly cemented their reputation in the Boston punk scene, filled with songs about beer, being a loser, and even a few juvenile- but-hilarious potshots at other local bands (and even the group's own members). Shortly after they released a split EP titled Skullbuster with the Skullys a high school punk band from Stoughton, MA they often gigged with. Songs include: \\"Waste of Life,\\" \\"Join the NRA,\\" and \\"Some Cunt Sneezed on my Sub\\". In 2000 the band added a second guitarist, Paul Delano. In addition, Danny O'Halloran replaced Edmonston as the group's drummer a few months later, and it was this lineup of Lashley, Gurley, Delano, and O'Halloran which won the WBCN Rock & Roll Rumble that year. In 2001 the band recorded five songs for a split EP with Tommy and the Terrors. The new songs received mixed reviews from the group's fans, some of whom felt that the new songs were \\"too serious.\\" Lashley decided to break up the band the same week, following a grinding month-long U.S. tour. Lashley continued writing songs and formed a country band, Lenny and the Piss Poor Boys, in 2002, which developed an audience of its own. Gurley moved on to The U.S.M., then to The McGunks. O'Halloran joined The Marvels, and Delano joined Avoid One Thing. Following his departure from the band, Edmonston formed a group called Linus. In May 2005, Lashley injured his left hand in a construction accident at Boston University, leaving him unable to play guitar for several months. The band temporarily brought Amy Griffin (Raging Teens/Avoid One Thing) on board as a second guitarist. A DVD containing concert footage of Darkbuster and Lenny and the Piss Poor Boys was released shortly after the accident, with proceeds set aside to help Lashley with his medical bills. A 2005 benefit concert featuring both of Lashley's bands performing with guest singers also raised money to help cover his medical bills. Shortly after in December 2005, it was announced that Edmonston would again be leaving the band at the end of the year, with Griffin becoming a full member and Lashley returning to guitar duties. In May 2006 the band signed with I Scream Records, who re-released A Weakness For Spirits in August 2006. The band was rumored to be compiling footage for a 10th anniversary DVD. Darkbuster band members have participated in various side projects during their active years as well as their moments of hiatus. In July 2005 Gurley and Edmonston released an album entitled 90 Miles From Launch To Target from their side project band, Drago. In October 2006 Lashley's country band Lenny and the Piss Poor Boys released their eponymous debut album on Lude Boy Records. Unfortunately, John Erik Johnson, the bass player for Lenny and the Piss Poor Boys and the Bourbonaires, died on January 17, 2007. Lenny Lashley continued to make music with his solo project Lenny Lashley's Gang of One as well as Street Dogs. Although an official breakup was never announced, the band stopped performing and went on a hiatus. It wasn't until December 27, 2009, that Darkbuster played their first show in almost two years at Boston's House Of Blues for the 12th Mighty Mighty Bosstones' Hometown Throwdown. In 2015, after eight years of recording, Darkbuster released No Revolution under Pirate Press Records. The release was paired with several sold-out nights of \\"Reunion\\" concerts in August 2015. Unfortunately, many of the original members were not involved in the performances. Discography *22 Songs You'll Never Want To Hear Again!

Also known as high-modulus polyethylene, (HMPE), it has extremely long chains, with a molecular mass usually between 3.5 and 7.5 million amu. The longer chain serves to transfer load more effectively to the polymer backbone by strengthening intermolecular interactions. This results in a very tough material, with the highest impact strength of any thermoplastic presently made.Stein, H. L. (1998). Ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylenes (uhmwpe). Engineered Materials Handbook, 2, 167–171. UHMWPE is odorless, tasteless, and nontoxic.Wong, D. W. S.; Camirand, W. M.; Pavlath, A. E.; Krochta, J. M.; Baldwin, E. A. and Nisperos-Carriedo, M. O. (eds.) (1994) \\"Development of edible coatings for minimally processed fruits and vegetables\\" pp. 65–88 in Edible coatings and films to improve food quality, Technomic Publishing Company, Lancaster, PA. . It embodies all the characteristics of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) with the added traits of being resistant to concentrated acids and alkalis, as well as numerous organic solvents. It is highly resistant to corrosive chemicals except oxidizing acids; has extremely low moisture absorption and a very low coefficient of friction; is self- lubricating (see boundary lubrication); and is highly resistant to abrasion, in some forms being 15 times more resistant to abrasion than carbon steel. Its coefficient of friction is significantly lower than that of nylon and acetal and is comparable to that of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, Teflon), but UHMWPE has better abrasion resistance than PTFE. Development Polymerization of UHMWPE was commercialized in the 1950s by Ruhrchemie AG,Die Aktivitäten der Ruhrchemie AG auf dem Gebiet der Kohlevergasung. In: Glückauf- Forschungshefte, Jg. 44 (1983), pp. 140–145. which has changed names over the years. Today UHMWPE powder materials, which may be directly molded into a product's final shape, are produced by Ticona, Braskem, DSM, Teijin (Endumax), Celanese, and Mitsui. Processed UHMWPE is available commercially either as fibers or in consolidated form, such as sheets or rods. Because of its resistance to wear and impact, UHMWPE continues to find increasing industrial applications, including the automotive and bottling sectors. Since the 1960s, UHMWPE has also been the material of choice for total joint arthroplasty in orthopedic and spine implants. UHMWPE fibers, commercialized in the late 1970s by the Dutch chemical company DSM, are widely used in ballistic protection, defense applications, and increasingly in medical devices. Structure and properties Structure of UHMWPE, with n greater than 100,000 UHMWPE is a type of polyolefin. It is made up of extremely long chains of polyethylene, which all align in the same direction. It derives its strength largely from the length of each individual molecule (chain). Van der Waals bonds between the molecules are relatively weak for each atom of overlap between the molecules, but because the molecules are very long, large overlaps can exist, adding up to the ability to carry larger shear forces from molecule to molecule. Each chain is bonded to the others with so many van der Waals bonds that the whole of the inter-molecular strength is high. In this way, large tensile loads are not limited as much by the comparative weakness of each van der Waals bond. When formed into fibers, the polymer chains can attain a parallel orientation greater than 95% and a level of crystallinity from 39% to 75%. In contrast, Kevlar derives its strength from strong bonding between relatively short molecules. The weak bonding between olefin molecules allows local thermal excitations to disrupt the crystalline order of a given chain piece-by-piece, giving it much poorer heat resistance than other high-strength fibers. Its melting point is around ,ultra high molecular weight polyethylene; UHMWPE. chemyq.com and, according to DSM, it is not advisable to use UHMWPE fibres at temperatures exceeding for long periods of time. It becomes brittle at temperatures below . The simple structure of the molecule also gives rise to surface and chemical properties that are rare in high-performance polymers. For example, the polar groups in most polymers easily bond to water. Because olefins have no such groups, UHMWPE does not absorb water readily, nor wet easily, which makes bonding it to other polymers difficult. For the same reasons, skin does not interact with it strongly, making the UHMWPE fiber surface feel slippery. In a similar manner, aromatic polymers are often susceptible to aromatic solvents due to aromatic stacking interactions, an effect aliphatic polymers like UHMWPE are immune to. Since UHMWPE does not contain chemical groups (such as esters, amides or hydroxylic groups) that are susceptible to attack from aggressive agents, it is very resistant to water, moisture, most chemicals, UV radiation, and micro-organisms. Under tensile load, UHMWPE will deform continually as long as the stress is present—an effect called creep. When UHMWPE is annealed, the material is heated to between 135 °C and 138 °C in an oven or a liquid bath of silicone oil or glycerine. The material is then cooled down at a rate of 5 °C/h to 65 °C or less. Finally, the material is wrapped in an insulating blanket for 24 hours to bring to room temperature.Hoechst: Annealing (Stress Relief) of Hostalen GUR Production Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) is synthesized from its monomer ethylene, which is bonded together to form the base polyethylene product. These molecules are several orders of magnitude longer than those of familiar high-density polyethylene (HDPE) due to a synthesis process based on metallocene catalysts, resulting in UHMWPE molecules typically having 100,000 to 250,000 monomer units per molecule each compared to HDPE's 700 to 1,800 monomers. UHMWPE is processed variously by compression moulding, ram extrusion, gel spinning, and sintering. Several European companies began compression molding UHMW in the early 1960s. Gel- spinning arrived much later and was intended for different applications. In gel spinning a precisely heated gel of UHMWPE is extruded through a spinneret. The extrudate is drawn through the air and then cooled in a water bath. The end-result is a fiber with a high degree of molecular orientation, and therefore exceptional tensile strength. Gel spinning depends on isolating individual chain molecules in the solvent so that intermolecular entanglements are minimal. Entanglements make chain orientation more difficult, and lower the strength of the final product. Applications = Fiber= LIROS Dyneema hollow Dyneema and Spectra are brands of lightweight high-strength oriented- strand gels spun through a spinneret. They have yield strengths as high as 2.4 GPa (2.4 kN/mm2 or 350,000 psi) and density as low as 0.97 g/cm3 (for Dyneema SK75)Crouch, Ian. 2016. The Science of Armour Materials. P229. Woodhead Publishing.. High-strength steels have comparable yield strengths, and low- carbon steels have yield strengths much lower (around 0.5 GPa). Since steel has a specific gravity of roughly 7.8, these materials have a strength-to- weight ratios eight times that of high-strength steels. Strength-to-weight ratios for Dyneema are about 40% higher than for aramid. Dyneema was invented by Albert Pennings in 1963 but made commercially available by DSM in 1990. UHMWPE are used as composite plates in armor, in particular, personal armor and on occasion as vehicle armor. Civil applications containing UHMWPE fibers are cut-resistant gloves, bow strings, climbing equipment, automotive winching, fishing line, spear lines for spearguns, high-performance sails, suspension lines on sport parachutes and paragliders, rigging in yachting, kites, and kite lines for kites sports. For personal armor, the fibers are, in general, aligned and bonded into sheets, which are then layered at various angles to give the resulting composite material strength in all directions.Bhatnagar, A. (ed.) (2006) Lightweight Ballistic Composites: Military and Law-Enforcement Applications. Honeywell International. Recently developed additions to the US Military's Interceptor body armor, designed to offer arm and leg protection, are said to utilize a form of Spectra or Dyneema fabric. Dyneema provides puncture resistance to protective clothing in the sport of fencing. The usage of Dyneema/Spectra rope for automotive winching offers numerous advantages over the more common steel wire. The key reason for changing to Dyneema rope is the additional safety offered. The lower mass of Dyneema rope, coupled with significantly lower elongation at breaking, carries far less energy than steel or nylon, which leads to almost no-snap back. Dyneema rope does not create kinks that can cause weak spots and also, by being a rope instead of a cable, any frayed sections that may appear along the length of the rope cannot pierce the skin like traditional wire can. Dyneema rope is less dense than water, making water recoveries easier as the recovery cable is easier to locate than traditional wire. The bright colours available also aid with visibility should the rope become submerged or dirty. Another advantage to automotive applications is the reduced weight of Dyneema rope over traditional steel cables. A typical 11mm Dyneema rope of 30 metres can weigh around 2kg, the equivalent steel rope would weigh around 13kg. One notable drawback of Dyneema rope is its susceptibility to UV damage, meaning many users will fit winch covers in order to protect the cable. Spun UHMWPE fibers excel as fishing line, as they have less stretch, are more abrasion- resistant, and are thinner than traditional monofilament line. In climbing, cord and webbing made of combinations of UHMWPE and nylon yarn have gained popularity for their low weight and bulk. They exhibit very low elasticity compared to their nylon counterparts. Also, low elasticity translates to low toughness. The fiber's very high lubricity leads to poor knot-holding ability, and is mostly used in pre-sewn 'slings' (loops of webbing) — relying on knots to join sections of UHMWPE is generally not recommended, and if necessary it is recommended to use the triple fisherman's knot rather than the traditional double fisherman's knot. Ships' hawsers and cables made from the fiber (0.97 specific gravity) float on sea water. \\"Spectra Wires\\" as they are called in the towing boat community are commonly used for face wires as a lighter alternative to steel wires. It is used in skis and snowboards, often in combination with carbon fiber, reinforcing the fiberglass composite material, adding stiffness and improving its flex characteristics. The UHMWPE is often used as the base layer, which contacts the snow, and includes abrasives to absorb and retain wax. It is also used in lifting applications for manufacturing low weight, and heavy duty lifting slings. Due to its extreme abrasion resistance it is also used as an excellent corner protection for synthetic lifting slings. High-performance lines (such as backstays) for sailing and parasailing are made of UHMWPE, due to their low stretch, high strength, and low weight. Similarly, Dyneema is often used for winch-launching gliders from the ground, as, in comparison with steel cable, its superior abrasion resistance results in less wear when running along the ground and into the winch, increasing the time between failures. Dyneema was used for the 30-kilometre space tether in the ESA/Russian Young Engineers' Satellite 2 of September, 2007. Dyneema Composite Fabric (DCF) is a laminated material consisting of a grid of Dyneema threads sandwiched between two thin transparent polyester membranes. This material is very strong for its weight, and was originally developed for use in racing yacht sails under the name 'Cuben Fiber'. More recently it has found new applications, most notably in the manufacture of lightweight and ultralight camping and backpacking equipment such as tents and backpacks. In archery, UHMWPE is widely used as a material for bowstrings because of its low creep and stretch compared to, for example, Dacron (PET). Besides pure UHMWPE fibers, most manufacturers use blends to further reduce the creep and stretch of the material. In these blends, the UHMWPE fibers are blended with, for example, Vectran. In skydiving, Spectra is one of the most common materials used for suspension lines, largely supplanting the earlier-used Dacron, being lighter and less bulky. Spectra has excellent strength and wear-resistance, but is not dimensionally stable (i.e. shrinks) when exposed to heat, which leads to gradual and uneven shrinkage of different lines as they are subject to differing amounts of friction during canopy deployment, necessitating periodic line replacement. It is also almost completely inelastic, which can exacerbate the opening shock. For that reason, Dacron (PET) lines continue to be used in student and some tandem systems, where the added bulk is less of a concern than the potential for an injurious opening. In turn, in high performance parachutes used for swooping, Spectra is replaced with Vectran and HMA (high- modulus aramid), which are even thinner and dimensionally stable, but exhibit greater wear and require much more frequent maintenance to prevent catastrophic failure. Spectra / Dyneema are also used for reserve parachute closing loops when used with automatic activation devices, where their extremely low coefficient of friction is critical for proper operation in the event of cutter activation. =Medical= UHMWPE has a clinical history as a biomaterial for use in hip, knee, and (since the 1980s), for spine implants. An online repository of information and review articles related to medical grade UHMWPE, known as the UHMWPE Lexicon, was started online in 2000.UHMWPE Lexicon. Uhmwpe.org. Retrieved on 2012-06-30. Joint replacement components have historically been made from \\"GUR\\" resins. These powder materials are produced by Ticona, typically converted into semi-forms by companies such as Quadrant and Orthoplastics, and then machined into implant components and sterilized by device manufacturers.GHR HMW-PE and VHMW-PE. ticona.com UHMWPE was first used clinically in 1962 by Sir John Charnley and emerged as the dominant bearing material for total hip and knee replacements in the 1970s. Throughout its history, there were unsuccessful attempts to modify UHMWPE to improve its clinical performance until the development of highly cross-linked UHMWPE in the late 1990s. One unsuccessful attempt to modify UHMWPE was by blending the powder with carbon fibers. This reinforced UHMWPE was released clinically as \\"Poly Two\\" by Zimmer in the 1970s. The carbon fibers had poor compatibility with the UHMWPE matrix and its clinical performance was inferior to virgin UHMWPE. A second attempt to modify UHMWPE was by high-pressure recrystallization. This recrystallized UHMWPE was released clinically as \\"Hylamer\\" by DePuy in the late 1980s. When gamma irradiated in air, this material exhibited susceptibility to oxidation, resulting in inferior clinical performance relative to virgin UHMWPE. Today, the poor clinical history of Hylamer is largely attributed to its sterilization method, and there has been a resurgence of interest in studying this material (at least among certain research circles). Hylamer fell out of favor in the United States in the late 1990s with the development of highly cross-linked UHMWPE materials, however negative clinical reports from Europe about Hylamer continue to surface in the literature. Highly cross-linked UHMWPE materials were clinically introduced in 1998 and have rapidly become the standard of care for total hip replacements, at least in the United States. These new materials are cross-linked with gamma or electron beam radiation (50–105 kGy) and then thermally processed to improve their oxidation resistance. Five-year clinical data, from several centers, are now available demonstrating their superiority relative to conventional UHMWPE for total hip replacement (see arthroplasty). Clinical studies are still underway to investigate the performance of highly cross- linked UHMWPE for knee replacement. In 2007, manufacturers started incorporating anti-oxidants into UHMWPE for hip and knee arthroplasty bearing surfaces. Vitamin E (a-tocopherol) is the most common anti-oxidant used in radiation-cross-linked UHMWPE for medical applications. The anti-oxidant helps quench free radicals that are introduced during the irradiation process, imparting improved oxidation resistance to the UHMWPE without the need for thermal treatment.Wannomae, K. K., Micheli, B. R.; Lozynsky, A. J. and Muratoglu, O. K. (2010) \\"A new method of stabilising irradiated UHMWPE using Vitamin E and mechanical annealing\\". 56th Annual Meeting of the Orthopedic Research Society, 2290. Several companies have been selling antioxidant- stabilized joint replacement technologies since 2007, using both synthetic vitamin E as well as hindered phenol-based antioxidants.Spiegelberg, S.H. (2012) \\"UHMWPE for total joint arthroplasty: Past, present, and future\\". Bonezone. Another important medical advancement for UHMWPE in the past decade has been the increase in use of fibers for sutures. Medical-grade fibers for surgical applications are produced by DSM under the \\"Dyneema Purity\\" trade name. =Manufacturing= UHMWPE is used in the manufacture of PVC (vinyl) windows and doors, as it can endure the heat required to soften the PVC-based materials and is used as a form/chamber filler for the various PVC shape profiles in order for those materials to be 'bent' or shaped around a template. UHMWPE is also used in the manufacture of hydraulic seals and bearings. It is best suited for medium mechanical duties in water, oil hydraulics, pneumatics, and unlubricated applications. It has a good abrasion resistance but is better suited to soft mating surfaces. =Wire/cable= Fluoropolymer / HMWPE insulation cathodic protection cable is typically made with dual insulation. It features a primary layer of a fluoropolymer such as ECTFE which is chemically resistant to chlorine, sulphuric acid and hydrochloric acid. Following the primary layer is an HMWPE insulation layer, which provides pliable strength and allows considerable abuse during installation. The HMWPE jacketing provides mechanical protection as well.\\"Cathodic Protection\\". Performance Wire and Cable. =Marine infrastructure= UHMWPE is used in marine structures for the mooring of ships and floating structures in general. The UHMWPE forms the contact surface between the floating structure and the fixed one. Timber was and is used for this application also.

It is particularly associated with Prussia, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Sweden and the Netherlands.  Austria  The Austro-Hungarian Landsturm was a reserve force that consisted of men aged 34 to 55. It was intended to provide replacements for the front line units and provide a militia for local defense. It was divided into the Austrian K.u.K. (Kaiserlich und Königlich, \\"Imperial and Royal\\") Landsturm and the Hungarian Kgl. (Königlich, \\"Royal\\") Landsturm. During the First World War, the Austrian Landsturm formed 40 regiments totaling 136 battalions in Austria and the Hungarian Landsturm formed 32 regiments totaling 97 battalions. They provided 20 Brigades who took to the field with the rest of the army.  Germany  = Prussia from 1813 = In Prussia after the of 21 April 1813 all the male population from ages 15 to 60 who were capable of military service, who were not in the standing army or the Landwehr, had to respond to the orders of the Landsturm. It effectively formed the last national military reserve. King Frederick William III of Prussia established the Prussian Landsturm as irregular military forces on 21 April 1813 by royal edict – the decree appeared in the ' (German: Prussian Code of Law) (pp. 79–89). The 1813 edict called for resistance \\"by any means\\" against the Napoleonic invasion. As a model and an explicit example, it took the Spanish Reglamento de Partidas y Cuadrillas of 28 December 1808 and the decree of 17 April 1809, known as Corso Terrestre, during the Peninsula War against Napoleonic troops (ref. the introduction, §8, §52). According to this edict, all Prussian citizens were obliged to oppose the invasion by the enemy using any weapons available, like axes, pitchforks, scythes or shotguns (§43). All Prussians were further encouraged to not obey orders by the enemy, but rather to make themselves a nuisance to the Napoleonic troops however possible. This was a clear departure from ordinary jus in bello (Latin for Law of War), which commanded the civilian population to obey the orders of the occupying power, and the police forces to assist the occupying power in crushing any uprising. It did not qualify as an insurgency, but simply as criminal activity. The Landsturm edict explicitly stated that it was preferable to risk the danger brought about by the furies of an armed population rather than to let the enemy have control over the situation. Légitime défense \\"justified the use of all means\\" (§7), including chaos. The edict was modified less than three months later on 17 July 1813 and was purified of its subversive content relative to the laws of war. The war then took place according to the standard rules of conventional warfare. Carl Schmitt qualified it as the \\"Magna Carta of the partisan\\". Despite its not being put to practice, fascist jurists considered it in a 1962 lecture in Francoist Spain to be the \\"official document of the legitimation of the partisan of national defense\\" and as the \\"philosophical discovery of the partisan.\\"Carl Schmitt, 1963. Theorie des Partisanen. Zwischenbemerkung zum Begriff des Politischen, Chapter I, Section 2 = North German Confederation from 1867 = The North German Confederation Act of 9 November 1867 about the obligation for wartime military service and the Reich law about the Landsturm of 12 February 1875 restricted the obligation to the period from 17 to 42 years of age. =Bavaria from 1868= In the Bavarian Army the oldest ages for compulsory military service since the army reform of 1868 was referred to as the Landsturm.  Sweden  Swedish landstorm troops in 1914–1915. In February 1808, Russia invaded Swedish Finland and on 14 March Denmark-Norway declared war on Sweden, starting the Finnish War. On the very same day of the Danish declaration of war, Gustav IV Adolf, the Swedish king, issue a decree that ordered the formation of a new military unit, called Lantvärnet, which is the Swedish name for landwehr. The decree stated that all able unmarried men between 18 and 25 would become eligible to be conscripted for service in lantvärnet. The plan was that lantvärnet would consist of 60,000 men, almost at par with the standing army that numbered 66,000 men. However, in reality, lantvärnet consisted of only circa 30,000 men. The soldiers of lantvärnet were poorly equipped and they only received their pay on an irregular basis. This led to low morale amongst the men. After the war had ended the common people had a very negative view on lantvärnet and conscription. Lantvärnet was abolished in 1811. Some believe that the popular resistance against conscription caused by the neagtive experiences of lantvärnet lived on for many years and was one of the main causes that Sweden didn't reintroduce conscription until 1901. In 1885, the Swedish parliament passed a law that formed Landstormen. All able Swedish males between 27 and 32 would serve in landstormen as a territorial defence force in case of war. Landstormen however then only existed in theory and lacked any organization; only in the case of war were the Swedish Army to prepare plans and organizations for the landstorm. In 1892 the law was changed, and all men between 33 and 40 would serve in Landstormen in case of war. In 1901 Sweden introduced conscription, and became a proper second line unit, organizing the elder conscripted men (those between 33 and 40), and were tasked with territorial defence as well as securing the mobilization of the field army. In 1914 the law was changed and landstormen was to organize all men between 35 and 42. Also a mandatory 5 days refresher training was mandated for all those that belonged to landstormen. During World War I, Landstormen was frequently mobilized to secure the Swedish neutrality. Landstormen was again mobilized during World War II. In 1942 the Swedish Army went through a major re-organization and landstormen was abolished and incorporated into the regular army.  Switzerland  In the Swiss Army, the Landsturm was, until 1995, the third age class (men from 42–50) after the Elite (men from 18–32) and the Landwehr (men from 32–42).

Very few pins are needed (in most cases, only at the two edges.) The very early bobbin laces were probably made freehand, as pins were scarce, coarse, and expensive. At first, the laces were purely utilitarian: “seaming” laces (insertions) joining narrow widths of fabric, and toothed or scalloped laces reinforcing the edges (edgings). Many of the later freehand laces were also functional, but some areas produced very wide ornamental laces. Traces of freehand lace can be found nearly everywhere: they were part of the textiles produced in pre-industrial communities. Production only survived in a few places, often because the lace was sold through handicraft organizations, when it no longer adorned the peasant costume and household textiles. There are a few areas with a living tradition, like Dalarna and Skåne in Sweden, several areas in Slovakia, Cogne and Pescocostanzo in Italy, and Mikhailov in Russia. Freehand lace is dense compared to lace made on a pattern. Wide areas without pins can be constructed by using certain techniques: the different parts of the lace must be made in the right order, and a triple half stitch can be used to secure the threads instead of a pin. In many areas, the laces are made wider by combining two or more patterns lengthwise. The lengths of the repeats are usually quite different. Many other laces have traits inherited from freehand lace, for example, the patterns and the working of the braids in Milanese lace, and the grounds without pins and the exchange of workers in linen stitch in some of the Flemish laces. The term 'freehand lace' was first used as the translation of an Italian term in the English edition (1913) of Elisa Ricci's Antiche Trine Italiane. It is called 'lace without a pattern' in French, 'numeric lace' in Russian, and the Slovaks have named it by the fact that it is produced on a bare pillow. In Swedish, the verb used for composing a poem is also used for making freehand lace. The basic research on Freehand Lace was made by Bodil Tornehave of Denmark, and published in her book Danske Frihåndskniplinger (, Danish Freehand Lace) in 1987. 'Freehand lace' is sometimes confused with 'free lace', which is a modern, artistic form of lace.

History  TESO Research Lab In 1998, Teso was founded, and quickly grew to 6 people, which first met in 1999 at the CCC Camp near Berlin. By 2000, the group was at its peak, and started speaking on various conferences, wrote articles for Phrack and released security tools and exploits at a very high pace.

Institutional researchers collect, analyze, report, and warehouse quantitative and qualitative data about their institution's students, faculty, staff, curriculum, course offerings, and learning outcomes. They are involved in collecting and reporting information to government bodies (for example, in the USA, the United States Department of Education's Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System), to the public (e.g., Common Data Set, the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities's University-College Accountability Network), and various college guide publishers (e.g., U.S. News & World Report and College Board). On occasion, institutional researchers share data with one another to compare their own practices and outcomes against those of similar institutions. Institutional research is the source of much of the information provided to regional and national accreditation bodies to document how institutions fulfill the standards for accreditation. In addition to reporting, institutional researchers often engage in data analysis, ranging from simply testing whether differences in reported data are statistically significant to developing and using causal and predictive statistical models. Such models are often used in support of assessment and strategic enrollment management.  Becoming an Institutional Researcher  Due to the need to provide data to the federal government and other entities, nearly every post-secondary institution has offices that fulfill the institutional research function. At some colleges and universities this function is centralized in a single office of institutional research, while at others it is more de-centralized. There is no single academic degree that qualifies one to be an institutional researcher, but suggested strengths include a knowledge of statistics, research methods (e.g., survey research and focus groups), and computer-based reporting and data visualization tools (e.g., SPSS, SAS, R, STATA, Microsoft Access, Microsoft Excel, MicroStrategy, and SQL). Other important assets are strong written and oral communications skills, attention to detail, and knowledge about how institutions of higher education operate. Several American universities offer graduate certificate programs in institutional research,http://www.airweb.org/Careers/GraduateEducation/Pages/default.aspx including Ball State University, Florida State University, Humboldt State University,http://humboldt.edu/dee/ircertificate/ North Dakota State University, Penn State University, Indiana University, University of Missouri, University of Illinois, the University of Wisconsin - Stout http://www.uwstout.edu/programs/pdc/es.cfm, and the University of California San Diego Extension. https://extension.ucsd.edu/courses-and- programs/institutional-research, References External links *List of Institutional Research offices in Canada *List of Institutional Research offices in North America *Australasian Association for Institutional Research *University of Illinois Division of Management Information, Institutional Research Category:Academia Category:Educational administration ","title":"Institutional research"},{"id":"2138565","text":"Leslie Richard McKeown (born 12 November 1955) is a Scottish pop singer who was the lead singer of the Bay City Rollers during their most successful period.

It was first published in 1984 in the United States by Greenwillow Books then in 1985 in Great Britain by Methuen Children's BooksFIRE AND HEMLOCK. by JONES, Diana Wynne.: London Methuen - Roger Middleton P.B.F.A. Retrieved 2013-02-11. It has been republished several times since then in paperback, by various publishers. In-print versions are published by Collins in Britain and by HarperTeen in the United States, both divisions of HarperCollins. Firebird, an imprint of Penguin Group, released a new paperback edition on 12 April 2012. Fire and Hemlock was a Phoenix Award Honor Book in 2005. Plot summary As she clears out her old bedroom, Polly discovers that below her memories, in which she led an entirely normal and unremarkable life, there is a second set of memories, which are rather unusual. As Polly thinks back to this \\"second set\\" of memories, the point where they seem to diverge is when she stumbled into a funeral in an old mansion, Hunsdon House, when she was ten and playing with her best friend, Nina. There, she was approached by a man named Thomas Lynn who took her back outside and kept her company. He takes her back inside to help him select six pictures from a large pile, his share of the estate of the deceased; one of them is a photograph called \\"Fire and Hemlock\\" (hence the name of the novel), which he gave to her. He then takes her back to her grandmother's house, where she is living. Over the following years Tom and Polly continue a friendship largely through correspondence, with occasional visits. Tom sends her books and letters with stories in them, many of which tie into the general theme of his predicament. Together, the two come up with stories about a hero named Tan Coul and his assistant Hero, who are Mr. Lynn's and Polly's alter egos, respectively. These stories all eventually come true, after a fashion. For instance, after discussing Tan Coul's horse, they encounter an identical horse disrupting traffic in the streets of London, having escaped from a nearby circus. An invented town and hardware store later turn out to be real, the proprietor being the spitting image of Tom, and his nephew Leslie falling into the story much later as a possible victim of Laurel's. Tom and Polly's story features three other heroes; later on, Tom gives Polly a photograph of all the members of his orchestra, and asks her to identify them. She immediately finds the other three heroes. These three are exactly the ones with whom Tom was considering setting up an independent string quartet. All the while, Polly encounters members of Tom's ex-wife's family, all of whom seem to be threatening her and trying to break off her relationship with Tom. These include Seb, who is a few years older than Polly. Polly understands the threats as Laurel (Tom's ex-wife) having some sort of power over him. Tom refuses to talk about it. This friendship develops against the background of Polly's growing up in her own disintegrating family life: her father Reg leaves, and a new lodger moves in and begins a relationship with her mother, Ivy. When Ivy sends her to live with her father in Bristol, it soon becomes apparent that she was not wanted there, her father having neither told his girlfriend that she was coming nor that she was supposed to live with them permanently. Eventually Polly moves in with her grandmother, who acts as a strong, fierce, strict anchor in her life. As Polly turns sixteen, she realises that she has always loved Tom, but when she is rejected by him (in part because of their age difference, but also for her own safety, as she later discovers) she sets out to discover the secret of his relationship with the sinister Laurel that is somehow connected to all the supernatural events that happen to Tom and her. To do this, she performs voodoo-like ceremony, and it partly succeeds – she is summoned to Hunsdon House, where it all started. Laurel is there, but humiliates Polly and tells her (untruthfully) that Tom is dying of cancer, and wants to be left alone by her. Mortified, Polly agrees to forget him, and leaves. Her second set of memories ends here. Three years later, sitting in front of the picture (that she now realizes was a gift from Tom) Polly decides to start investigating, and finds out that all memory of Tom has been erased from her life, and that he has been eradicated from the memories of anyone who should have known him. As well as this, other people that she met in connection with Tom have no idea who she is, her friend Nina believes that Polly stopped talking to her years ago, and friends that she met through Tom have apparently never met her. She becomes frustrated, and is determined to find Tom, the man she knew and still loves. In this she is aided by reading two ballads, Tam Lin and Thomas the Rhymer, which help her figure out the truth. In reality, Tom has entered into a deal with the so-called Queen of the Fairies – Laurel. The time has now come when he must give his life to prolong that of her husband, the sinister Morton Leroy, the King of the Fairies. Using the information in the ballads as an instruction, she arrives at the ceremony over which Laurel is presiding, and manages to outwit her and secure Tom's life, and, depending on the way you interpret the strange happenings of the ending, his love. Characters *Polly Whittacker is the main protagonist. *Thomas Lynn who shares a special relationship with Polly, and whom Polly must rescue from Laurel. *Granny is Polly's paternal grandmother whom Polly goes to live with at the age of ten. *Laurel is the antagonist, or the \\"Queen of the Faeries\\" in this retelling. *Ivy is Polly's mother. *Nina is Polly's childhood friend. In Polly's \\"revised\\" set of memories, her friendship with Nina was erased. *Fiona Perks who becomes Polly's good friend and later her flatmate, and is instrumental in verifying the existence of Tom later on. Major themes Feminism – The original story of Tam Lin is one of a resourceful and brave young girl named Janet who rescues her lover from the faeries. When Jones was writing this novel, she knew that she needed \\"a narrative structure which did not simply put a female in a male's place\\".\\"Retelling Stories, Framing Culture: Traditional Story and Metanarratives in Children's Literature.\\" Stephens, John : 224 However, through most of the book Polly is a tomboy. In the stories she and Tom tell, she casts herself in the role of \\"Hero\\", Tom Lynn's girl assistant, who must disguise herself as a boy. Allusions to other works This story explicitly mirrors the folktale of Tam Lin, which existed since at least the mid-sixteenth century. Diana Wynne Jones wrote that her goal was \\"to write a book in which modern life and heroic mythical events approached one another so closely that they were nearly impossible to separate.\\"\\"Retelling Stories, Framing Culture: Traditional Story and Metanarratives in Children's Literature.\\" Stephens, John : 222 The funeral building represents Carterhaugh. Tom Lynn is Tam Lin, who is being used as a tithe to Hell. His ex-wife Laurel represents the Queen of the Faeries. Polly directly identifies herself with Janet, after reading the Oxford Book of Ballads, and thinks she \\"can only hope she might manage to do what Janet had done\\".Fire and Hemlock. Jones, Diana Wynne : 307 The overall structure of the book is modeled after T.S. Eliot's Four Quartets, which in Jones' words \\"combines static meditation with movement in an extraordinary way, to become a quest of the mind away from the Nothing of spiritual death (Hemlock), towards the Fire which is imagination and redemption – the Nowhere.\\"Diana Wynne Jones, \\"The heroic ideal – a personal Odyssey\\", The Lion and the Unicorn, v.13:no.1 (June 1989), discussed in the blog Two Sides to Nowhere References to other works As Polly grows up, Tom Lynn sends her books, many of which are intended to inform her indirectly of his pact with Laurel. He says at one point, regarding a book of fairy stories, \\"Only thin, weak thinkers despise fairy stories. Each one has a true, strange fact in it, you know, which you can find if you look.\\".Fire and Hemlock. Jones, Diana Wynne : 144 These include The Golden Bough, East of the Sun and West of the Moon, and The Oxford Book of Ballads (which contains both Thomas the Rhymer and Tam Lin). After reading The Three Musketeers by Alexandre Dumas, Polly refers to herself as Porthos (her favourite character) in the clandestine letters she mails to Tom. Later in the book, Tom and his friends form a string quartet under the name of The Dumas Quartet, and assigns aliases to each member; Tom is Athos. Polly reads The Lord of the Rings and writes a long story in which her alter ego Hero bravely destroys a dangerous ring. She posts it to Tom and is crushed when he tersely writes back \\"Use your own ideas.\\"Fire and Hemlock. Jones, Diana Wynne : 157 There are many other passing references to other works of literature, art, and music found throughout the book. =Literature= There are 12 books that Polly receives for Christmas.

It was created by Eleanor \\"Cissy\\" Patterson of the Medill–McCormick–Patterson family (long-time owners of the Chicago Tribune and the New York Daily News and founding later Newsday on New York's Long Island) when she bought The Washington Times and The Washington Herald from the syndicate newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst (1863–1951), and merged them. The result was a \\"24-hour\\" newspaper, with 10 editions per day, from morning to evening. History Washington Times-Herald Masthead 1954In 1917, Hearst acquired the old Washington Times. It had been established in 1894 and owned successively by Congressman Charles G. Conn (1844–1931) of Elkhart, Indiana, publisher Stilson Hutchins (1838–1912, previous founder/owner of The Washington Post, 1877–1889), and most recently Frank A. Munsey (1854–1925), a financier, banker and magazine publisher known as the \\"Dealer in Dailies\\" and the \\"Undertaker of Journalism\\" for his extensive newspaper syndicate. Five years later, he bought the Herald, which had been founded in 1906. Cissy Patterson, first cousin of Tribune publisher Robert McCormick and younger sister of Daily News publisher Joseph Medill Patterson, was editor of both papers from 1930 on, and leased them from Hearst in 1937. She was eager to buy them outright, and was able to do so in 1939 at the confluence of Hearst's near-bankruptcy caused by the increasing costs of his Hearst Castle in San Simeon, California, and the purchase attempts by the rival Washington Post family of Eugene Meyer (1879–1959) and Phillip L. Graham (1915–1963), who had bought the then bankrupt Post at auction in 1933. Patterson merged the papers into the Times-Herald, which she ran until her death in 1948. McCormick had purchased the newspaper following Cissy Patterson’s 1948 death. The paper became an \\"isolationist and archconservative\\" publication known for sensationalism. McCormick appointed his niece, Ruth \\"Bazy\\" McCormick Miller as the publisher of the paper in 1949. He wanted Miller to use the paper to create \\"an outpost of American principles\\". When the two came to a parting of the ways over her relationship with one of the paper's editors, Garvin Tankersley, as well as editorial control over the paper, he ordered her to choose between Tankersley and the Tribune Company. As a result, she eloped with Tankersley and resigned from the Times-Herald. She later said, \\"I understood when I went to the Times-Herald I was to have full control. That control was not given me ... There is some difference in our political beliefs. I have broader Republican views than [McCormick] has. I am for the same people as the colonel, but I am for some more people. The Washington Times-Herald Building was built by architect Philip Morrisson Jullien. Purchase by The Post McCormick tried to run the paper himself, but lost money on the venture, and sold the Times-Herald to The Washington Post in 1954. When he announced the sale, one of the paper's board members insisted that Miller, by then Bazy Tankersley, be given a chance to purchase it, so McCormick gave her 48 hours to match the $10 million asking price. She could not raise the money to do so. In March 1954, the Times-Herald was purchased by Graham, owner of the Post. For a time, the combined paper was officially known as The Washington Post and Times-Herald, but the Post consolidated its market position by discontinuing the rival paper. The Times- Herald portion of the nameplate became less and less prominent on a second line in ensuing years and was dropped entirely in 1973.

First Amendment Center Biography Jack Landau was born to Jacob and Florence Landau (formerly Florence Binaghi). He spent his elementary school years in Englewood, New Jersey, but the family moved to New Rochelle, New York, when he was 12 years old. Landau attended New Rochelle High School, where he was a varsity swimmer and voted \\"most talkative boy.\\" He then attended Harvard College, where he majored in history.Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard. Niemans in the News - Jack Landau Dies at 74. Nieman Foundation for Journalism After graduating from Harvard, Landau lived briefly in San Francisco, working retail jobs and trying to write fiction. Prior to the establishment of the Reporters Committee, Landau worked as a journalist for several national news organizations including the Bergen Record, Associated Press and The Washington Post. His stories covered numerous topics, but his specialty was reporting on the American courts. Landau was a Harvard College graduate and legally trained reporter in an era when this was an oddity, having received a law degree from New York University. His reports of inequities in the American military justice system are credited with having prompted the reform of that system into its current modern shape. He also covered the Cuban Revolution for the Associated Press, stationed in Havana (Landau spoke conversational Spanish). Landau also served as the press secretary to United States Attorney General John Mitchell. John Mitchell served as Attorney General under President Richard Nixon. As the spokesman for Mitchell, Landau addressed the public concerning many of the difficult legal issues facing the U.S. Government during the late 1960s. During one incident, he addressed a hostile and abusive crowd of activists opposed to the Vietnam War who were demanding an audience with the Attorney General during a large- scale protest. Their leader was American beat poet Allen Ginsberg, who purportedly dismissed Landau as a tool of the establishment. Ironically, it was Landau’s organization, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, that would rock the establishment by preventing Richard Nixon from destroying his records in the wake of the Watergate scandal. Under Landau’s leadership, the Reporters Committee would become America’s foremost activist organization in furtherance of the rights of journalists and reporters. This work won Landau numerous awards and accolades. He had a falling-out with the Reporters Committee during the late 1980s, after which he left to write a popular column in the Newhouse News syndicate of daily newspapers. Landau was retired at the time of his death. He was divorced and had two children with former spouse, attorney Brooksley E. Born.

This colorless solid, like its chromium and tungsten analogues, is noteworthy as a volatile, air-stable derivative of a metal in its zero oxidation state. Structure and properties Mo(CO)6 adopts an octahedral geometry consisting of six rod-like CO ligands radiating from the central Mo atom. A recurring minor debate in some chemical circles concerns the definition of an \\"organometallic\\" compound. Usually, organometallic indicates the presence of a metal directly bonded via a M–C bond to an organic fragment, which must in turn have a C–H bond. By this strict definition, Mo(CO)6 is not organometallic. Preparation Mo(CO)6 is prepared by the reduction of molybdenum chlorides or oxides under a pressure of carbon monoxide, although it would be unusual to prepare this inexpensive compound in the laboratory. The compound is somewhat air-stable and sparingly soluble in nonpolar organic solvents. Occurrence Mo(CO)6 has been detected in landfills and sewage plants, the reducing, anaerobic environment being conducive to formation of Mo(CO)6. Intermediate in inorganic and organometallic synthesis Mo(CO)6 is a popular reagent in organometallic synthesis because one or more CO ligands can be displaced by other donor ligands.http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/teaching- labs/inorganic2ndyear/2004-2005labmanual/Experiment3.pdf Mo(CO)6, [Mo(CO)3(MeCN)3], and related derivatives are employed as catalysts in organic synthesis for example, alkyne metathesis and the Pauson–Khand reaction. Mo(CO)6 reacts with 2,2′-bipyridine to afford Mo(CO)4(bipy). UV-photolysis of a THF solution of Mo(CO)6 gives Mo(CO)5(THF). =[Mo(CO)4(piperidine)2]= The thermal reaction of Mo(CO)6 with piperidine affords Mo(CO)4(piperidine)2. The two piperidine ligands in this yellow-colored compound are labile, which allows other ligands to be introduced under mild conditions. For instance, the reaction of [Mo(CO)4(piperidine)2] with triphenyl phosphine in boiling dichloromethane (b.p. ca. 40 °C) gives cis-[Mo(CO)4(PPh3)2]. This cis- complex isomerizes in toluene to trans-[Mo(CO)4(PPh3)2]. =[Mo(CO)3(MeCN)3]= Mo(CO)6 also can be converted to its tris(acetonitrile) derivative. The compound serves as a source of \\"Mo(CO)3\\". For instance treatment with allyl chloride gives [MoCl(allyl)(CO)2(MeCN)2], whereas treatment with KTp and sodium cyclopentadienide gives [MoTp(CO)3]− and [MoCp(CO)3]− anions, respectively. These anions react with a variety of electrophiles. A related source of Mo(CO)3 is cycloheptatrienemolybdenum tricarbonyl. =Source of Mo atoms= Molybdenum hexacarbonyl is widely used in electron beam-induced deposition technique - it is easily vaporized and decomposed by the electron beam providing a convenient source of molybdenum atoms. Safety and handling Like all metal carbonyls, Mo(CO)6 is dangerous source of volatile metal as well as CO.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1977 to 1985, and was a cabinet minister in the Progressive Conservative governments of Bill Davis and Frank Miller. His father, Goldwin Elgie, was also a Conservative Ontario MPP in the 1930s and 1940s. He was a member of the Ontario Press Council from 2001, serving as chair from 2006 until his death. Background Robert Elgie was born in Toronto, Ontario. He received his B.A. from the University of Western Ontario in 1950, his LL.B. from Osgoode Hall Law School and his medical degree from the University of Ottawa. He trained as both a lawyer and neurosurgeon, and worked in the medical field. Elgie taught at the medical schools of Queen's University and the University of Toronto and was chief of medical staff at Scarborough General Hospital. Politics Elgie was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in the 1977 provincial election, winning an easy victory in the Toronto-area seat of York East. After a brief period in the government backbenches, he was appointed to Bill Davis's cabinet on August 18, 1978 as Minister of Labour. A Red Tory by ideology, Elgie was easily the most left-wing figure in the Davis cabinet. He was supported by the province's unions, and passed amendments to Ontario's Human Rights Code and Occupational Health and Safety regulations which were favourable to labour interests. Some campus Progressive Conservative groups opposed his efforts to grant human rights officers the right to investigate and arbitrate reports of workplace discrimination. Elgie was easily re-elected in the 1981 election, and was named Minister of Consumer and Commercial Relations on February 13, 1982. He supported Roy McMurtry's bid to succeed Davis as party leader in 1985. When Frank Miller replaced Davis as Premier of Ontario on February 8, 1985, he named Elgie as his Minister of Community and Social Services. He was re-elected with a reduced majority in the 1985 election, as the Progressive Conservatives won a narrow minority government under Miller's leadership. Elgie was again appointed as Minister of Labour on May 17, 1985. Following the election, Elgie favoured an alliance with the New Democratic Party to keep the Progressive Conservatives in power. These plans came to nothing, and the opposition Liberal Party was able to form a minority government with NDP support on June 26, 1985. Elgie had little interest in serving on the opposition benches, and soon accepted an appointment by new Liberal Premier David Peterson as chair of the Workers' Compensation Board of Ontario. He formally resigned from the legislature on September 26, 1985, and served as chair of the Ontario Worker's Compensation Board until 1991. =Cabinet posts= Later life After leaving the WCB, he moved to Nova Scotia, and served as the founder first director of Dalhousie University's Health Law Institute from 1991 until 1996. He was appointed part-time chair of Nova Scotia's Workers' Compensation Board in the same period, and is credited with making significant improvements to this board's activities. Returning to Ontario, Elgie then served as chair of the Patent Medicine Prices Review Board from 1995 to 2005, and was appointed chair of the Ontario Greenbelt Council by the provincial Minister of Municipal Affairs in the summer of 2005 with a salary of $1 a year. On Jan. 1, 2006, he became the 6th Chair of the Ontario Press Council, of which he had been a member since 2001. He served as chair until his death in 2013. In his later life he lived in the town of Georgina, Ontario in York Region. Despite serving and supporting the Tories for much of his life, Elgie's left leaning ideologies led him away from the conservative party later in his life. During the Mike Harris government of the 1990s, Elgie complained that the Ontario Progressive Conservatives had become too right- wing.Walker, William (July 6, 1997). \\"Old guard Tories fear right-wing Harris: With his policies, can the party win re-election?\\", Toronto Star, p. A1. Elgie was named to the Order of Canada in 2003. He died on April 4, 2013 from congestive heart failure. Family Bob Elgie married his wife Nancy in 1956, and she became an integral part of his life and career. Nancy, a psychologist by trade, served as a school trustee (and vice chair 2011-13 and 2015) in the York Region District School Board. She stepped down in 2017 after becoming embroiled in a prolonged racial controversy.https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/york-trustee-accused- of-racism-steps-down/article34072325/ Together they raised 5 children, and despite his many careers, Bob always did his best to make time for his family. Elgie helped create a loving home and taught his children that those who are born into affluence are expected to give back to society. His eldest daughter, Allyson, is a psychologist who runs a provincial assessment and research centre, The Regional Assessment and Resource Centre, which provides supports to post-secondary students with disabilities.http://www.queensu.ca/rarc/about/rarc-staff His eldest son, Stewart, is an environmental advocacy lawyer, founder of the Sierra Legal Defence Fund, and a professor at the University of Ottawa.https://llmphd.uottawa.ca/en/about/faculty/elgie-stewart In 2007 Stewart founded Sustainable Prosperity, an environmental research and policy initiative.

In 1819, by which time Ililin was being called Iriron, a new parish was created with a population of 1,300 persons.Postma, Antoon. 1982. \\"Calintaan: Glimpses From Its Historic Past\\". San Carlos Publications. Cebu City. p. 4 Pirate attacks continued to plague the region, and residents continued to leave until, by 1829, the population had dwindled to 150. Only a few buildings were left, among them the church, a convent and the prison. By 1871, Spain had managed to control the problem of piracy throughout the Philippines, and the villages of Mindoro repopulated. In the area called Magarang a cattle ranch was set up by a Spaniard named Pascual Ledesma.Cordova, Gregoria. 1988. \\"History of Calintaan\\". Unpublished. This ranch was purchased by the Augustinian Recollects in 1894. The Order brought in a new administrator, Espiridion Jiminez, who would become \\"capital del pueblo\\" when the ranch became a pueblo in 1896. After some disagreement with the friars, Capitan Jimenez relocated his family and followers—including the families Pascual, Labrador, Pudan, Romaquin, Picarzo and Isidro-to found a new community, in a place they called Calintaan after the word for the leeches which they encountered there. During the revolution against the Spanish authorities, Capt. Jimenez, Isidro Zamora, Pedro Dapil and Marcelino Vitang were among the leaders of the local rebellion. They joined forces with Captain Pedro Fernandez' revolutionaries from Sablayan. Also in Fernandez' group were Vicente Gallembas, Tiago Dangeros, Carpo Urieta, Docoy Eniega, Vicente Dangcoding, Tiago Dantayana and Paeng Dawatis. With the approval of other revolutionary leaders, including the leaders of West Mindoro and Calapan, Jiminez and Fernandez combined their groups to march on El Pueblo de Magarang in 1897, where the 75-man company captured the Spaniards and missionary friars. Antoon Postma, a Dutch researcher, indicated that the captured men were held for a time at Magarang before being sent, by way of Paluan, to Taysan, Batangas. The captives were held for several years before the Americans occupied Mindoro and freed them in 1904. = The American occupation = After the end of the Spanish regime, Calintaan became progressive, with Eligio Jimenez serving as the first appointed cabeza de barangay. Sablayan became a municipality during the American period, holding jurisdiction over barrios including Iriron and Calintaan. The municipal board of Sablayan was dominated by representatives from Calintaan. Some of these representatives were Leoncio Panganiban, Benigno Lontoc, Juanito Gonzales, Juan Credo, Pedro Credo, Agustin Esmelo, Francisco Esmelo, Eriberto Lineses, Atanacio Encomio,Pedro Romaquin, Constancio Villarosa, Cornelio Gasmin, Aniceto Apigo, Alberto Obispo, Amador Ulay and Vicente Isidro. Calintaan saw its first primary school open in 1914. During this period, the residents of Calintaan requested that they be established as a municipality themselves rather than sitting as a barrio of Sablayan. They felt that Sablayan was too far away for easy governance. The petition was heard in Calapan, which at that time served as Provincial Council of all of Mindoro. Although some from the Sablayan municipal council supported the petitioners, their request was ultimately declined because it was feared that Calintaan did not have enough income to maintain a municipal government. In 1940, a resident of Calintaan, Pedro Gonzales, became mayor by a wide margin of Sablayan, becoming the first from Calintaan to do so.Candelario, Rudy. 1997. Interview with Sablayan Ex-Mayor Pedro Gonzales [insert term of office] = World War II = Less than a year after Gonzales' election, World War II caused most of the residents of Calintaan to evacuate, including the mayor himself. Calintaan was occupied by the Japanese in April 1942, at which point all evacuated houses were burned. Men who had remained during the evacuations were forced to work in San Jose at a military camp. On December 15, 1944, the island was liberated by Allied Forces, led by U.S. Brigadier General William Dunckel. From that point until May 1943, the American forces used the area of Sitio Bulangcog, Barrio Iriron, for a radar station with which they could monitor enemy warplanes. = Post- War = Occidental Mindoro and Oriental Mindoro were formalized as provinces after the war on November 15, 1950. The population of Mindoro boomed as residents arrived from elsewhere, and the forests were cut from surrounding areas. Communal irrigation systems were built for ricefields. The indigenous Tau-Buhid or Batangan tribe relocated to the mountains. Calintaan itself became a municipality distinct from Sablayan on June 18, 1966, with governance of an area of 38,250 hectares, including the barrios of Concepcion, Iriron, New Dagupan and Tanyag.Philippine Statistics Authority (NSO). 1970. Census of Population, 1970. In response to public demand, a high school was also opened in 1966, located in Poblacion, Calintaan.Candelario, Rudy. 1997. Interview with Dr. Iluminada Remo [resident of Calintaan] Calintaan's first municipal mayor was Felomino Jiminez, elected on November 14, 1967. = The new town = In 1970, the barrio high school became a municipal high school, with extension classes opening at Tanyag, Iriron and Concepcion. At this time, the population of the Calintaan jurisdiction was 7,949. Due to continued immigration, the additional barrios of Poypoy and Malpalon were added to Calintaan. Home of the indigenous population, these have subsequently become Barangays. National parks were established in Poypoy, Calintaan and Sablayan to protect endangered species, including Mindoro's unique wild animals, the tamaraw. National agencies stepped in for other work as well, including improving irrigation. In 1971, during the first year of service of Calintaan Mayor Amador Sison, the Philippines entered a state of martial law. The national government then saw to additional improvements in Calintaan, including enlarging the canals so as to provide better irrigation and building roads and bridges. After Sison's death in April 1977, the office was inhabited by Vice Mayor Romeo Calabio, who in three years of service oversaw the addition of a health center and the initiation of a central town water system, before the next election on January 30, 1980. Following that election, Felomino Jimenez returned as municipal mayor to continue civic improvements. Important to the region, an Apostolic Vicariate of San Jose in Mindoro was created at St. Joseph Cathedral, San Jose, Occidental Mindoro. On July 1, 1983, Bishop Vicente Manuel, a grandson of Espiridion Jimenez, became its first Vicar Apostolic. Bishop Manuel was active in overseeing the implementation of programs in Calintaan engineered to improve the lives of Catholic residents. Following Mayor Jimenez's death on August 30, 1985, Vice Mayor Apolinario Bullagay entered office. = Revolution = All of the officials in Calintaan were, like the rest of local officials in the Philippines, replaced by President Corazon Aquino following the peaceful revolution at EDSA in 1986. Edgardo Gagtan was appointed as OIC- Mayor. He initiated the construction of the public market, school buildings and communal faucets in some barangays. The municipality of Calintaan endured turbulent times, as the New People’s Army (NPA) attacked it and its barrios as part of their campaign against the government. The Philippine government countered the revolutionaries by conducting seminars to promote its aims and granting amnesty and awarding land to those who chose to reform. After several years, rebel unrest in Calintaan quieted. The area quickly went through several mayors following 1996 before Rolando Sison was elected in 1991, and civic construction continued.Candelario, Rudy. 1997. Interview with Mr. Hoverto Isidro [Calintaan Municipal Councilor, 1980 to 1987] Meanwhile, the area's high school had continued to grow until, along with the barangay schools at Tanyag, Iriron and Concepcion, it became a national high school (CNHS) by executive order of Aquino. Sison's successor, attorney Eric Labrador (who had briefly served during those years of unrest) returned to office in 1995 and continued to oversee construction until the 1998 election of Renato Paulino. During Sison's term, the Apostolic Vicariate formed a farmers' cooperative and instructed area farmers in Integrated Pest Management (IPM). = The new millennium = Under Paulino's term as mayor, the area continued to expand, with new roads and public buildings, including a nursery and public market. He also oversaw the initiation of a gymnasium, which is not yet completed.Candelario, Rudy. 2007. Interview with Eilene Dionisio [resident of Calintaan]. A rebel group known as the New Peoples Army (NPA) is still a threat to the peace of Calintaan notwithstanding governmental efforts to sway leftist groups to democracy. In 2007, Lily Racca Estoya became the mayor, with former Mayor Paulino, who had just completed his third term, as her running mate. Demographics  Economy  The economy of Calintaan is mainly agricultural, and its major crop is rice. Other crops produced and sold in Calintaan include corn, legumes, coconuts, and bananas. Practices such as fishing, livestock, poultry, banana processing (banana chips) and buricraft (the production of goods made from buri fibers such as buntal) are also important to the economy.

Later on, a few families of tribal Filipinos, known as Ratagnons, settled near the mouth of a river which was called Bogsanga. According to the Hanunoos, another group of tribal Filipinos, living on the hills, about ten kilometers west of Bogsanga, the original name of the river was Bisanga, a word from their dialect which means \\"It branched out.\\" They gave the river that name for the said body of water came from two sources. Political leaders of San Jose and Occidental Mindoro felt that the barrios between Busuanga and Lumintao River should be created as another municipality. In anticipation of the creation of a new town, residents of Barrio Limlim decided to change the name of their community to Rizal. They expressed their desire that their barrio would be made as the center of the town. When Pedro Medalla Sr. was elected in 1965 as representative of Occidental MIndoro, one of the bills he filed in Congress was the creation of the municipality of Rizal. Through his effort, Republic Act No. 5460 was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Ferdinand Marcos. Rizal became a municipality on April 3, 1969. Ten barrios composed the new town. They were Adela, Rumbang, Salvacion, Magui, Magsikap, San Pedro, Santo Nino, Pitogo, Aguas and Rizal (Limlim).

The first accounts of the baptism of the locals under the Recollects were recorded in 1670. By 1749, Dongon became the biggest pueblo in the whole island of Mindoro in terms of population. In 1754, the Moro pirates started attacking the town, and almost every year thereafter, until in 1791 when the Moros effectively wiped out the whole population from more than 600 inhabitants to less than 98 souls. In 1814, the inhabitants of Dongon gradually transferred to the village of Sablayan, until Dongon ceased to become a village in 1829. In 1832, the missionary friar Simeon Mendoza de la V. de Ibernalo requested the Spanish government for the exemption of the town's inhabitants from paying taxes so that they could build a stone church, convent and fort at a hilly part of the village. The church that stands today at the town may have been built from 1832-1835, and its advocacy was placed under San Sebastian.

History The Municipal Government of Plaridel was one of the original towns of the Province of Misamis before it was divided into two (2) provinces (Oriental & Occidental) under Legislative Act. No. 3537 passed November 2, 1929. Subanon people, also known as Suban-on, Subanons or Subanens are the original settlers of the town. The word \\"Suba\\" means a river, while the suffix -nun or -nen means place of origin, attributing that Subanens were river dwellers. They cultivated vast lands along Langaran River, from the word “LANGANAN”, the local term for “delay”. A river so named because of its circuitous, winding route that traverses many kilometers. This river then was the highway by which people travelled on to reach the different settlements located along the riverbanks. Tales have it that the first Spaniard who arrived in one of the riverbank settlements asked what the name of the place was. Thinking that the Spaniard was asking for the name of the river, the settlers answered, “LANGANAN”. The Spaniard found it hard to pronounce and instead uttered “LANGARAN” . This became the name of the place which now is the Municipality of Plaridel. Original settlers of LANGARAN were the Subanens. Farming, fishing and hunting were their means of livelihood. With their slash and burn (Kaingin) way of farming, they opened tracts of land for agricultural purposes. These tracts were later on bartered for axe heads and salt with the migrants. The town named Langaran was changed into “Plaridel” in the year 1907, when the late Santos Palma was elected municipal President. From that period the town Langaran disintegrated bringing along a big portion of its territorial area which later on formed into a separate municipality now known as the Municipality of Sapang Dalaga and the district of Concepcion. Later on, the sitio of Daisug became a town now known as the Municipality of Lopez Jaena. During the administration of then President Manuel Acuna Roxas, Sitio Solinog now known as Calamba was created into a separate municipality.

In 2007, the University of Canterbury Students' Association controversially agreed to sub-licence the RDU frequency to a newly formed company, RDU98.5FM Ltd and students against the sale selectively leaked information to the Press stating the station was sold for the price of $1. Actually the stations assets including broadcast equipment and transmitters were sold at market (book) value, a market level rental agreed for the space occupied and an annual licence fee agreed. Various arrangements were debated over the preceding three years following the previous limited liability company (controlled by minority shareholders) trading insolvently which forced UCSA to inject funds and restructure the organisation.

It checks for genes that code for specific liver enzymes which activate, deactivate, or are influenced by various drugs. There are currently four genetic markers commonly tested for: 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, and 1A2. This testing has been done for some time by drug companies working on new drugs, but is relatively newly available to the general public. Strattera is the first drug to mention the test in the official documentation, although it doesn't specifically recommend that patients get the test before taking the medication. There are four possible categories for each marker: poor metabolizer, intermediate metabolizer, extensive metabolizer, or ultra- extensive metabolizer. Different testing companies may call these by different names. Extensive metabolizers (that is, people who are extensive metabolizers of a given type) are the most common, and are the type of people for which drugs are designed. Up to 7% of Caucasians are poor metabolizers of drugs metabolized by the CYP2D6 enzyme. Saturday, 16 February 2019 People who cannot metabolize a drug will require a much lower dose than is recommended by the manufacturer, and those who metabolize it quickly may require a higher dose. Some drugs, such as codeine, will not be effective in people without the requisite enzymes to activate them. People who are poor metabolizers of a drug may overdose while taking less than the recommended dose.

The station is at the site of the junction between the London to Weymouth mainline and the West Coastway Line running between Southampton and Portsmouth. It is currently served mainly by South Western Railway, with irregular services operated by Southern. There are four platforms; two on the main line and two on the branch line. History St Denys station building (now in private ownership) The original station was opened by the London and South Western Railway on 1 May 1861 and named Portswood after the small village to the west of the main line. Shortly after, to accommodate the Portsmouth branch line, a new station building was built to the south; the relocated station was opened on 5 March 1866. However to avoid confusion with Portsmouth, the station was renamed to St Denys on 1 January 1876. The station buildings themselves are fine examples of Victorian architecture.

He was the second son of Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV and Bertha of Savoy, and their eldest son to reach adulthood, his older brother Henry having been born and died in the same month of August 1071. Conrad's rule in Lorraine and Germany was nominal. He spent most of his life in Italy and there he was king in fact as well as in name. Childhood Conrad was born on 12 February 1074 at Hersfeld Abbey while his father was fighting against the Saxon Rebellion. He was baptised in the abbey three days later. After Henry's victory against the Saxons, he arranged for an assembly at Goslar on Christmas Day 1075 to swear an oath recognising Conrad as his successor. After the death of Duke Godfrey IV of Lower Lorraine on 22 February 1076, Henry refused to appoint the late duke's own choice of successor, his nephew, Godfrey of Bouillon, and instead named his two-year-old son Duke of Lower Lorraine. He did appoint Albert III of Namur, the deceased duke's brother-in-law, as his son's vice-duke (vicedux) to perform the daily functions of government. He also allowed the march of Antwerp to pass to Godfrey of Bouillon. The total absence of Conrad from his duchy caused or abetted the decline of ducal authority in it. In 1082, while Conrad was in Italy, the peace of God was introduced into the diocese of Liège. Conrad passed Christmas 1076 at Besançon with his parents. Early the next year (1077) he accompanied his father across the Alps on the way to Canossa, because there was nobody in Germany to which Henry could entrust his son. Conrad subscribed to his first royal charter in 1079. When Henry returned to Germany, Conrad remained in Italy to act as a pledge to the imperialist party there. He was placed in the care of Archbishop Tedald of Milan and Bishop Denis of Piacenza, both excommunicated prelates and opponents of Pope Gregory VII. In October 1080, Conrad was present in the camp when a force from northern Italy defeated the troops of Marchioness Matilda of Tuscany near Mantua. In December 1080, the Saxon lords who had supported the kingship of the late Rudolf of Swabia against Henry gathered \\"to discuss the state of their kingdom [Saxony]\\" in Bruno of Merseburg's words. Henry sent envoys to the Saxons asking them to accept his son Conrad as their king, and in exchange he promised never to enter Saxony. (Conrad was apparently back in Germany.) Otto of Northeim, speaking for the Saxons, \\"desired neither the son nor the father\\" since he had \\"often seen a bad calf begotten by a bad ox.\\" Conrad depicted as duke of Lower Lorraine (the caption reads Cunr[adus] dux) in a family tree of the Holy Roman Emperors from a late 12th-century manuscript In 1081, Henry entered Italy, where he endeavoured to wed his son to a daughter of Robert Guiscard, Duke of Apulia. He offered Robert the march of Fermo as well, but no marriage could be agreed to since the duke refused to do homage for Apulia. Again Henry left Conrad in Italy (July 1081), this time in the care of the lay princes \\"to watch over the province for him\\", according to the Annales Brunwilarenses and Annales Patherbrunnenses. Salian king In 1087, Conrad returned to Germany. On 30 May, he was crowned king in Aachen by Archbishop Sigewin of Cologne. The ceremony was attended by Albert of Namur, Godfrey of Bouillon and Duke Magnus of Saxony, according to the Annales Weissenburgenses. The last reference to Conrad as duke of Lower Lotharingia (dux Lothariorum) comes from a charter issued at Aachen shortly before his coronation, after which Henry appointed Godfrey of Bouillon duke in his place. By January 1088 Conrad had returned to Italy, with Bishop Ogerius of Ivrea as his chancellor and advisor. Shortly after his return to Italy, his mother died. The passing of Bertha perhaps provoked the rupture between Conrad and his father. In Italy, Conrad was unsuccessful in resisting Matilda of Tuscany until his father came down in the spring of 1090. In 1091 he was at his father's side, as his \\"most beloved son\\". On 19 December 1091 Conrad's grandmother, the Margravine Adelaide of Turin, died. She had named her ten- year-old great-grandson, Peter, as her heir following the death of Peter's father, Count Frederick of Montbéliard on 29 June 1091. Henry, however, declared Conrad the rightful heir and placed him in charge of the march. The southern counties meanwhile were seized by Boniface I of Vasto and Henry granted the county of Asti to the bishop elect Oddo. Throughout 1092 Conrad was campaigning in the march of Turin to establish imperial control. Rebellion In 1093, with the support of Matilda and her husband, Welf V, along with the Patarene-minded cities of northern Italy (Cremona, Lodi, Milan and Piacenza), Conrad rebelled against his father. According to Ekkehard of Aura, he was instigated to revolt by \\"one of his father's ministeriales, who was likewise named Conrad\\". This was perhaps the same person as the Count Conrad sent by the young king as an envoy to King Roger II of Sicily, according to Geoffrey Malaterra. Ekkehard otherwise gives positive account of Conrad's motivation, describing him as \\"a thoroughly catholic man, most devoted to the apostolic see, inclining to religion rather than government or war ... well enough furnished with courage and boldness [yet] preferr[ing] to occupy his time with reading rather than with sports\\". Other sources favorable to Conrad include the Annales sancti Disibodi and the Casus monasterii Petrishusensis. Among sources unfavorable to him are the Annales Augustani and Henry IV's anonymous biography, the Vita Heinrici IV, which describes Conrad as a pawn in hands of Matilda of Tuscany. Bernold of St Blasien records that Henry was so abject after Conrad's rebellion that he attempted suicide, but this may be a hyperbole allusive to the suicide of the biblical King Saul. In mid-March Conrad was captured by his father through a ruse, but soon escaped and in late July was elected king by Matilda, Welf and their allies and crowned in Milan by Archbishop Anselm III. According to the historian Landulf Junior, he was also crowned at Monza, where the Iron Crown was being kept. After Conrad's coronation, Anselm died and the new king invested his successor, Arnulf III on 6 December 1093, although many of the bishops present to celebrate his coronation refused to attend the simoniacal investiture of Arnulf. The papal legate who was present, probably to speak with Conrad, immediately declared Arnulf deposed. The accusation might have been that Arnulf had performed undue service to Conrad to secure his investiture, or that he had been too obeisant, a charge of simony ab obsequio. Conrad was at the height of his power in 1094, when his father was staying with Margrave Henry and Patriarch Udalric in the March of Verona, unable to enter Italy. His antipope, Clement III, elected at the Synod of Brixen in 1080, who was travelling with him, even offered to resign so that Henry could negotiate with Pope Urban II if that was all that stood in the way. There is a contemporary tract, Altercatio inter Urbanum et Clementum, arguing the two popes claims should be adjudicated by a council. Papal anti-king In March 1095 Conrad attended the Council of Piacenza and confirmed the accusations of his stepmother, Eupraxia, that Henry IV was a member of a Nicolaitan sect, participated in orgies, and had offered Eupraxia to Conrad, stating that this was the reason for his turning against his father. Shortly after the council, he swore an oath of loyalty to Pope Urban II on 10 April at Cremona and served as the pope's strator (groom), leading the pope's horse as a symbolic gesture of humility first performed, according to tradition, by Constantine I. The duty of the strator had not been performed for a pope since the ninth century, and was revived specifically for Conrad. On 15 April, in a second meeting at Cremona, Conrad swore an oath, either of \\"security\\" or of \\"fealty\\", to the pope, guaranteeing the \\"life, limb and Roman papacy\\" to Urban. This oath was customary for kings who would be crowned emperor, but Conrad went further and promised to forsake lay investiture. Urban in turn promised Conrad \\"his advice and aid in obtaining the kingship and the crown of the empire\\", probably a promise to crown him in the future, after he had control of the kingdom. By these actions Conrad transformed himself from a rebellious son to a papally- sponsored anti-king and supporter of the Reform movement. In the same year, the pope and Matilda of Tuscany helped arrange a marriage of Conrad to Maximilla (also called Matilda), a daughter of Count Roger I of Sicily. Maximilla, escorted by Bishop Robert II of Troina, arrived at Pisa with a large fleet and a dowry of \\"many gifts of treasure\\". The wedding took place in Pisa in 1095. That same year, Matilda of Tuscany divorced Welf V, whose enraged father, Welf IV, switched allegiance and was restored to the duchy of Bavaria by the emperor in 1096. In 1097, Margrave Adalbert Azzo II died and his vast lands were disputed by his sons. Fulk and Hugh were supporters of Conrad, while Welf IV had sided with the emperor. In a sign of the turning tide, Welf, with the help of Patriarch Udalric and Duke Henry of Carinthia, invaded Italy and secured his claims to the inheritance. This reduced Conrad to total reliance on Matilda of Tuscany. Loss of support Early during the episcopate of Anselm IV of Milan, Conrad lost the support of the papalists in Lombardy. He once rhetorically asked Liutprand, one of the leaders of the Pataria, \\"Since you are a teacher of Patarenes, what do you think of bishops and priests who possess royal rights and present not food to the king?\\" Without Matilda's support, Conrad became a supporter of the Pataria. The historian Landulf Junior praised Conrad for refusing investiture to neither Arimanno da Gavardo, the bishop-elect of Brescia, nor to Anselm IV. In April or May 1098 at an assembly held in Mainz, Conrad's father had him formally deposed and his younger brother, Henry V, elected in his place. In a letter of 1106, Henry admitted that Henry V's election had been opposed by many and that he \\"fear[ed] that there would be civil war between the two brothers and that a great disaster would befall the kingdom.\\" After this, Conrad could hardly influence political events in Italy. There is no record that Urban or his successor had any contact with him, or that his father-in-law ever sent him support beyond his daughter's dowry. He died unexpectedly of a fever at the age of twenty-eight on 27 July 1101 in Florence. There were reports of poisoning. He was buried in Santa Reparata in Florence, now superseded by Santa Maria del Fiore. Miracles were said to have accompanied his funeral. According to Ekkehard of Aura, \\"the sign of the cross [appeared] on the arm\\" of Conrad's corpse, a clear indication that he was a crusader in spirit. Ekkehard also states that Conrad never tolerated any slander against his father, and always referred to him as lord and emperor.

These people founded a permanent settlement in an area close to the lake and flourished as time passed. The general exodus of people fleeing and being able to escape grave calamities such as Mayon's eruption was known in local vernacular as \\"naka-buhi\\". Local lore takes this as the most probable explanation as to how the town acquired its present name – Buhi. One version of local legend attributes the town being accorded the name to the time when the first Spaniards came and asked local settlers the name of the area. The local settlers misunderstood the question as how they came to be there and so gave the response \\"Naka-Buhi\\". There were two patron saints with whom the town directed their devotion. The first was St. Francis of Assisi placed in the church made of wooden materials. Unfortunately, in 1730 the church was razed down by fire. It was, however, replaced by a stone structure built under the supervision of Rev. Fray Jose de Cerda. Another saint was installed, St. Anthony of Padua.

Frank Lynch, S.J., who said that Canaman is the purest among Bicol dialects: “The name Canaman is locally said to be derived from the root kana, meaning \\"building materials\\". The suffix -man is taken as a locative, the name thus indicating “place where there are building materials”. History Spanish colonization in Canaman began around the 1580s when some Nueva Caceres-based missionaries apparently on their way back from gospel work in either the visita of Quipayo (now Calabanga) or San Gabriel (now a barangay of Pamplona), got their bearings confused and, thinking they were turning eastward from the Bicol River to its Naga tributary, instead entered the Canaman creek which at the time was still a deep and fast flowing stream. They continued paddling until they ended up at a native settlement in what is now the barangay of Poro. In June 1583, the place was organized into a parish, administered by Fray Pedro Matias de Andrade, a Franciscan who later became the fifth Bishop of Diocese of Caceres. In the 1590s, its church was constructed, which was rebuilt in 1669. The patron saint at that time was San Roque, whose image, said to have come all the way from Spain was met at its arrival by the people of Canaman in the shores of Pasacao. =Philippine-American War= In 1900, after militant Canamanons heard that the Americans were closing in, they burned the church to the ground in an act of self-immolation to prevent desecration of the church at the hands of the new imperialists. The burning was a deliberate and intentional act: the arsonists even gathered and piled on top of the church’s expensive organ dry grass and big tree branches to which they touched the match, to make certain that the fire consumed all combustible parts of the 231-year-old building and its interiors. In 1902, during the provincial governorship of Captain George Curry, the Municipality of Canaman and its office of the presidente municipal was dissolved and lost its independent existence. Canaman was annexed to Nueva Caceres (now Naga City), though some barrio were attached to Magarao and Canaman’s top position of presidente municipal was downgraded to concejal encargado. Public educational system reached Canaman in 1903 with the arrival of a certain Miss Long, an American schoolteacher. She opened the first school now known as Canaman Central School in Dinaga, at the house of Don Basilio Severo (at the spot where the Facoma building stands at present) which the government rented. In 1909, Canaman regained its status as an independent municipality, when it was separated from Nueva Caceres by an act of the First Philippine Legislature. This was mainly due to the efforts of Tomas Arejola, the representative of the first district of Ambos Camarines to the first legislature. =World War II= On March 8, 1942, three months after Japanese Imperial Forces landed in Legaspi and Naga City, the Tangcong Vaca Guerilla Unit (TVGU) was organized in Barangay San Nicolas, with Juan Miranda as the Commanding Officer, Leon Aureus as the Executive Officer and Elias Madrid as the Finance Officer. Among the numerous taga-Canaman who joined-up soon afterwards either in the unit’s intelligence or combat components were Jose and Antonio Madrid, Mamerto Sibulo, Andres Fortaleza, Marcos Severo, Damaso Avenilla, Federico Crescini, Nicolas Vargas, Venancio Begino, Eugenio Ragodon, Juan Pachica, Santiago Amaro, Jose Gervas, Pedro Angeles, Aproniano Lopez, Andres Alzate, Modesto Sanchez, Blas Alcantara, Andres Aguilar, Florencio Frondozo, Alfredo de la Torre and Flaviano Estrada. In April 1945, Canaman was liberated by the 5th, 52nd, 53rd, 55th, 56th and 57th Infantry Divisions of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and the Bicolano guerrilla resistance fighters of the Tangcong Vaca Guerrilla Unit (TVGU).

Fr. Oropesa penetrated the thick virgin forest of the Caramoan Peninsula and founded a small settlement in a place called Baluarte. This settlement was subsequently turned over to the administration of the Holy Bishopric in 1696. Prior to the arrival of the Spaniards, it was determined that the place was once called Guta de Leche, which was given by Dutch traders who operated a gold mine in Lahuy Island and who frequented the area to trade with the natives. The name was perhaps derived from the milkdrop stalagmites found among the rocks of Guta Port. Upon the arrival of the Spaniards, the place came to be called \\"Carahan\\" for the sea turtle, which was at that time to be found in great number along the shores of the Peninsula.

The 8th season of Koh-Lanta, the French edition of Survivor, also was shot there. TV director Corinne Vaillant stated that \\"the powdery sand, the coconuts on Gota beach and the neighboring islets are a 'dream' for the French people. We chose Caramoan because it’s really wild. It’s necessary that contestants don’t see anything other than nature for them to believe that they’re really lost in the wilds.” The only season of Survivor India was shot in Caramoan, with an Indian production crew spotted in the area in March 2011. The first season of Supraviețuitorul, a Romanian reality game based on Survivor was shot in Caramoan in the summer of 2016, as well as the first and second season of Robinsonův ostrov (Czech version).

History The original location of Garchitorena is said to be found at the mouth of the Pambuhan River but it was later transferred to Binanwahan primarily because of frequent attacks of the Moros. Soon, a rich man by the name of Don Andres Garchitorena, who hailed from Tigaon town and owned in this place a vast portion of the land area, persuaded the townspeople to plant abaca. He later established an abaca processing plant which started the establishment of this coastal settlement. The municipality was established on March 4, 1949 through Executive Order No. 205 signed by President Elpidio Quirino. It was originally named the municipality of Anderson. The municipality was then renamed after its founder and discoverer, Don Andres Garchitorena. He came from Tigaon. He was a member of Emilio Aguinaldo's Hong Kong Junta during the Spanish–American War. He became the governor of then Ambos Camarines in 1919.

Geography  Goa is bounded by the Municipality of Tinambac on the west, Municipalities of Tinambac and Lagonoy on the north, by Municipalities of Tinambac and Tigaon on the south, by Municipalities of San Jose and Lagonoy on the east. Goa has a total land area of or about 3.99% of the province' land area. Its distance from the nearest municipality, San Jose, is , the Capital Town of Pili is , while Naga City is . Furthermore, Goa’s distance from Manila via Daet, Camarines Norte, is about and via Quirino Highway is approximately . Barangays Goa is politically subdivided into 34 barangays, ten (10) of which are located within the poblacion/urban area and the remaining are considered rural barangays. The largest barangay is Hiwacloy having an area of and the farthest barangay is Tamban which is about from the poblacion area. =Climate= History The town of Goa was originally situated at Barangay Salog which was then known as “Visita de Salog”, comprising the barrios of Lalud (now known as barangay Salog), Himagaan, Matacla, and Payatan. Lalud is found along the banks of Cagaycay River and is about five kilometers away from the present site of the town center. The “visita” was established in 1701 by Franciscan Missionary Fr. Matias de Valdesoto and was attached to the parish of Manguiring, Calabanga. By 1729, it was declared independent and was later converted into a pueblo. The settlement center was later transferred to the present site because a disastrous flood swept the houses down the river and the inhabitants needed more land for planting. The original settlers found in the new site a wide stretch of plain land with brooks and rivers. There were scattered areas of swampland where 'gajo, a native slender cane plant the locals used for arrow shafts, grow in wild profusion. In 1777, Franciscan Friar Fr. Juan Abalay, from the Portuguese colony of Goa, came to administer the parish. It was on his arrival that the village was converted into a town with the official name of Pueblo de Goa. Fr. Abalay was instrumental in naming the town Goa, motivated presumably for two reasons: to perpetuate the memory of his birthplace and to give official confirmation to the name which the place has been known for some time corrupted allegedly by the Spaniards from “gajo”. On arrival, Fr. Abalay found Gregorio de los Reyes as Pueblo Headman and Santiago Evangelista, Juan de los Santos, Pedro Paraiso, Francisco Jacinto, Andres de la Trinidad and Lucas Delfin as council members. Fr. Abalay named Pedro de los Reyes son of the reigning Headman, “Cabeza de Barangay” in the cabeseria De Barangay del Pueblo De Goa. The German traveler, Feodor Jagor, found Goa a thriving municipality in 1863 when he scouted for guides who could accompany him climb Mount Isarog. In about the same year, the parish started the gigantic project of building a stone church and convent. The church, of Roman Gothic design and the convent, half stone and half wood, were completed in 1887. It took almost two decades of hard labor and involved every man, woman and child who was old enough to carry a piece of stone (known as cellar) to finish the project. A school building of stone was constructed soon across the street on the right side of the convent, to house the classes of the “primera enseñanza”. Another structure of the segunda enseñanza was added about the time the Revolution broke out in 1896. For the duration of the revolution and until the arrival of the Americans in 1900, Goa was governed by a local detachment of the revolutionary forces. The inhabitants called this period “Gobierno Filipino”. They elected the first “presidente” upon the implementation of the Maura Law. Jose Perfecto, headed the civil authorities with the “Cabezas de Barangay”, the past “Capitanes Municipales” serving as the local town council. Laureano Pan was the first to serve as the local executive (1901-1903) in Goa during the American occupation. The establishment of the first American school was hastened by the unexpected capture of “Commandante” Faustino Perfecto, in- charge of a contingent of KKK troops stationed at Panagan River, by the American troops on the road to Naga. The American school opened in 1902 with Samuel D. Broadley as the supervising teacher. The first three American teachers were Stickney, Cappage, and Tabor, a colored American. Evidently, the Americans realized as early as then, the strategic location and prominence of the town in Partido area. From 1904 up to the end of the decade, Goa was one of only four places in Ambos Camarines with intermediate classes up to grade seven. The others were Nueva Caceres (Naga City), Daet and Iriga. The national road connecting Goa to Naga via Anayan was constructed in 1917. It was also in 1917 when the construction of the Municipal Hall was started which was completed in 1922. With the first automobile that traveled the Naga-Partido road, modernization slowly flowed in. In 1925, Jose Centenera, installed the first electric generator that lighted the town until the Japanese occupation. In the same year, he also opened a movie house, which featured serialized silent movies. In 1926, Goa had a modern concrete market pavilion and abattoir to replace the old market building. The traditional Open Market day on Sunday, was initiated in 1945, though this is no longer true today since as the trade & commercial center in the 3rd District of Camarines Sur, everyday is already a market day. It was also in 1946 that Goa donated parcels of land to the Province of Camarines Sur for the establishment of Partido High School (converted to Partido National High School, then to Partido State College and now as Partido State University). Telecommunication service by telegraph was provided in 1950. The Goa Civic Square, an open park surrounded by huge acacia trees where the locals of Goa held almost all public activities – from amateur singing contest to political fora, benefit dances, fiesta celebrations, summer basketball competitions, etc., was constructed between 1952-1954. Next was the construction of the ABC Building between 1968-1971 under ABC President Alberto A. Din. The Camp Jovi Fuentebella in Lamon became the National Jamboree site in 1983. There was a trend of constructing covered basketball courts in majority of the municipalities in the country in the early nineties. By 1993, the Goa Civic Square was converted to become the covered Goa Sports Complex that now exists in front of the Goa Municipal Hall. Demographics In the , the population of Goa, Camarines Sur, was people, with a density of . While the population of Partido District grew at irregular paces during the decade, Goa has consistently to be the second most highly populated in the district next to Tinambac. In year 2000, the municipality has a population of 48,490 with a 14% share to the district’s total population of 341,487. Meanwhile, Tinambac has the highest share of 15% to the district’s population which is only a percent higher than of Goa. In 1995, Partido reached its highest growth rate of 2.58% but it dropped to 1.46% in year 2000. But Goa, on the other hand, showed a consistent average growth rate of 0.96% in 1990, 1.51% in 1995 and the highest rate of 2.50% in 2000. During the 2007 census, the municipality’s population ballooned to 54,035. =Isarog Agta Language= In 2010, UNESCO released its 3rd world volume of Endangered Languages in the World, where 3 critically endangered languages were in the Philippines. One of these languages in the Isarog Agta language which has an estimated speaker of 5 people in the year 2000. The language was classified as Critically Endangered, meaning the youngest speakers are grandparents and older, and they speak the language partially and infrequently and hardly pass the language to their children and grandchildren anymore. If the remaining 150 people do not pass their native language to the next generation of Isarog Agta people, their indigenous language will be extinct within a period of 1 to 2 decades. The Isarog Agta people live within the circumference of Mount Isarog, though only 5 of them still know their indigenous language. They are one of the original Negrito settlers in the entire Philippines. They belong to the Aeta people classification, but have distinct language and belief systems unique to their own culture and heritage. Infrastructure Goa is accessible from Naga City through a one and half-hour drive along the Fuentebella Highway. Two bus companies including air conditioned vans and jeepneys regularly ply the route to Goa. Jeepneys and trimobiles that convey people and products to and from the poblacion provide access to interior barangays. All barangays are accessible through regular transportation services. Goa's road system spans a network interconnecting the various barangays in the municipality. Presently, it has of barangay roads, of national roads, of provincial roads and of municipal roads. Majority of the roads however, are gravel roads () particularly those at the barangay level. Meanwhile, 96.91% of the municipal roads are concreted. There are 38 bridges in the municipality with a total length of 435.60 meters. Of which, 74.52% were constructed by the DPWH, 14% by PEO, 9.64% by LGU and 1.84 by barangay administration. Electricity in Goa is provided by the local electric cooperative (CASURECO IV). In 2001, a total of 7,702 households are connected to the power cooperative energizing the 34 barangays of the municipality, however there still 2,316 households in the rural areas that are dependent on kerosene for lighting purposes Environment protection Goa's environment sector revolves on two aspects: the forest environment and the urban environment. The protection of the forest environment is presently being handled by the DENR through the Office of the Protected Area Superintendent for Mt. Isarog National Park. The LGU, together with NGO representatives, is a member of the Protected Area Management Board. Such representation ensures Goa's participation in the protection of its portion in Mount Isarog. The urban environment protection is covered by the municipality’s Ecological Waste Management Program (EWAMP) which deals mainly in aspects of solid waste management, pollution control and monitoring of toxic emissions from industries. The EWAMP is equipped with heavy equipment transport utilities which regularly collect solid waste in commercial areas and urban barangays. The collected garbage is being dumped in a 16-hectare controlled dump site in San Isidro West located 11 kilometers away from the town proper.

History  Barely half a century after Ferdinand Magellan discovered the Philippines on March 16, 1521, Iriga, now a city, was only a visita of Nabua, Provincia de Ambos Camarines. Because of the disastrous floods that occur during rainy seasons in suburban Poblacion of Nabua, Father Felix de Huertas, the then parish priest, advised the farmers to move to I-raga (donde hay tierra or where there is land) where they can plant their crops without fear of being flooded. The flood victims of Nabua who moved earlier and followed the suggestions of their parish priest were the fortunate beneficiaries of the harvest of their agricultural plantation coming from the rich and fertile soils of I-raga, more so, those who planted at the foot of Sumagang Mountain (Mountain of the Rising Sun, now Mt. Iriga) said to be nature's given symbol of the Irigueños lofty ideals and noble visions. As population spread out and evangelization progressed, the settlement at the foot of Sumagang Mountain developed in size and wealth, slowly pushing the aborigines (Agta) up to the thickness of the forest. And in 1578 the I-raga settlement was established as “visita” of Nabua under Fray Pablo de Jesus and Fray Bartolome Ruiz, both Franciscans. Three decades later or on January 4, 1641, Mount Asog (named after a negrito chieftain who ruled the aborigines) or Mt. Iriga, erupted. That eruption brought much fear to the settlers but with their strong faith and belief a miracle happened and as witnessed by local folks, the apparition of the Blessed Virgin Mother and her son Lord Jesus or “Nuestra Señora de Angustia” at sitio Inorogan saved the people from terrible earthquake and flood. The eruption formed the cavernous gully on the side of Buhi leading to the steep gorge which was the crater of the “volcano”. Iriga, according to Fray Felix Huertas in his lengthily-titled Estado Geografico, Topografico, Estadisticdo, Historico-Reliogoso de la Santa Apostolica Provincia de S. Gregorio Magno published in 1865, came from the native word iraga, which means “poseedores de mucho terreno,” or “possessors of much land.” From a mere “doctrina,” a religious administrative word which roughly means a “mission post” in 1583. In 1683, this progressive visita of I-raga was converted into Pueblo de la Provincia de Ambos Camarines with a population of 8,908 which several decades later the name I-raga was changed to Iriga by the Spanish authorities and advocated St. Anthony of Padua as Patron Saint and June 13 as the annual fiesta. From the middle of the 19th century until the first two decades of the 20th century, Iriga was a major abaca- producing town in the Bicol region, largely because of the rich volcanic soil surrounding Mt. Iriga which it spewed in its last eruption about six hundred years before the coming of the Spaniards in Bikol. According to William Freer, the American Superintendent of Schools in Camarines Sur, “The sides of the mountain nourish rich plantations of abaca owned by several Spaniards, and shelter several hundreds of the Philippine aborigines, the Negritos, who are now employed on the plantations. Because of the production of abaca the town of Iriga ranks third in importance in Camarines, being outclassed only by Nueva Caceres and Daet.” During the incumbency of Don Martin Mendoza as Capitan Municipal, in the memorias de la Provincia de Ambos Camarines, showed that the “Pueblo de Iriga” was composed of “barrios y visitas distinguida la poblacion centro del casco en 5 barrios que son San Roque, San Francisco de Asis, San Juan Bautista, Santo Domingo de Guzman y San Miguel Arcangel con 6 visitas fuera del casco denominados San Nicolas de Tolentino, San Agustin, San Antonio Abad, Santo Niño, Santiago de Galicia y la visita de los monteses” with a population of 13,813. There were only four roads mentioned, they were coming from Nabua going to Baao, to Buhi and to Polangui, Albay, now the diversion road passing Salvacion, Masoli, Bato, then to the south road going to Polangui, Albay and there was only one way going to Nueva Caceres (Naga) via Bicol River by boat. In 1913, the Manila Railroad (MRR) Company Station and the public market were established in their respective present site which readily contributed to the rapid growth of Iriga making it the center of trade and commerce in Rinconada area. It was also at this time that Mondays and Thursdays were declared as market days in Iriga. The Municipality of Iriga continued to prosper through the years. The original “barrios y visitas” have developed sitios which later on, these sitios have metamorphosed into distinct and separate barrios. After the Second World War, San Ramon, San Rafael, Cristo Rey, Santa Isabel, San Vicente Norte, San Andres, Santa Teresita, Perpetual Help, Sagrada, Niño Jesus, San Pedro and Antipolo, former sitios of barrio San Agustin, San Isidro and San Nicolas were created as barrios. And, the barrios of La Anunciacion and Santa Elena were sitios of Santo Domingo and Santiago, Del Rosario (Banao) of Santiago and Santo Niño and La Purisima of San Francisco & part of Santo Domingo, Santa Cruz Sur of San Francisco. Francia and San Jose from San Miguel and San Vicente Sur, Salvacion, La Trinidad and La Medalla from the large barrio of San Antonio. Some of these barrios were already created during the incumbency of Mayor Jose C. Villanueva in 1960. And the latest and the 36th barrio ever created was Santa Maria which comprises the sitios of Tubigan, Katungdulan, Bagacay, Sampaga, Rao and Cawayan of barrio Santa Teresita by virtue of Republic Act 6228. = Cityhood = Through the unflinching support and willful cooperation of the town's people, Mayor Jose C. Villanueva at the helm of stewardship successfully gained the conversion of Iriga into the signing of R.A 5261 otherwise known as the Charter of Iriga City on July 8, 1968. The City, however, was formally organized and inaugurated as the third city of Bicol on September 3, 1968 by Presidential Proclamation and officiated by the President of the Philippines. Since then, Iriga City has developed tremendously making it not only as the center of trade and commerce in Rinconada area but the whole Bicol Region as well, as it is strategically located in between the cities of Naga and Legazpi. = Present = In 2004, Madelaine Alfelor-Gazmen, the daughter of the late Camarines Sur congressman, Ciriaco R. Alfelor and granddaughter of Camarines Sur Governor Felix O. Alfelor, became Iriga's first woman city mayor, and only the third city mayor after his uncle, Emmanuel R. Alfelor was similarly elected in 1994 and served the city for 3 consecutive terms (1994-2004). On May 9, 2016, Iriga produced its first and only senator of the Republic through the successful ascension of senator and human rights defender Leila de Lima in the Philippine Senate.https://news.abs- cbn.com/halalan2016/nation/05/19/16/officially-winners-comelec- proclaims-12-elected-senators  Mayors of Iriga City  CAPITAN MUNICIPAL * Don Felipe Monponbanua (1898-1899) PRESIDENTE MUNICIPAL * Don Felipe Monponbanua (1899-1900) * Don Eulogio Mirando (1923-1928) *Don Santiago Gonzales (1929-1937) MUNICIPAL MAYORS *Felix Alfelor, Sr. (1938-1940) *Don Felix Monte (1948-1951) *Don Santiago Ortega, Sr. (1952-1955) *Perfecto Taduran (1956-1959) *Jose C.

Year 1734 when the first Spaniards in this place found a small forested area near a creek where \\"hagonoy\\", a medicinal plant grew abundantly. Because the Spaniards could hardly pronounce the word \\"hagonoy\\" with the \\"j\\" sound, with \\"ha\\" of the first syllable, they deliberately decided to change \\"ha\\" to \\"la\\". Since then, the place was known as \\"Lagonoy\\". Some of the residents also believed that the name was taken from the word \\"lango\\" meaning drunk. During fiestas and other forms or merry making, men used to drink too much \\"tuba\\" (native wine) that they become drunk or \\"lango\\" (Bikol for drunk) so that the place was called by the neighboring towns as \\"Lagonoy\\".Cultural Inventory of the 4th District of Camarines Sur (Project in Social Science 4 classes, A/Y 2001- 2002 History In 1734, Partido towns of Caramoan, Lagonoy, Goa and Tigaon belonged to Albay. It was only in 1846 did Lagonoy belong to Camarines Sur. In a long research by Norman Owen, a feud between Lagonoy Parish and Franciscan Mission of Goa and Tigaon existed. In 1580, the administration by the Franciscans of Lagonoy Parish began until 1636, which was passed to the “mitre” of the bishop of Nueva Caceres. In 1580 to 1850, Lagonoy gulf had been very famous because of the constant moro raids in the Partido area and all coastal towns of Albay and Catanduanes. On the other hand, Lagonoy had other problems about the Remontados of Mt Isarog. F. Mallari, in his book- “Ibalon under siege and storm” said they were fallen Christians and confirmed by Fray Manuel Crespo, who spent many years inducing them to return to the town and live peacefully. Fray Matias de Valdesoto also noted in his visits to the sitios of Goa and Lagonoy that the natives planted corn, rice, root crops & tobacco. Kinahulogan Falls at Lagonoy, Camarines Sur.

Just like most cities in the Philippines, Milaor has a barangay system which is the core Local Government of the Philippines. Each barangay is headed by a chairman and barangay councils who were elected into office by popular vote of the community registered voters every three years. History The work of evangelization in Milaor began in 1579 when the Franciscan missionaries came to the Philippines upon the order of Pope Sixtus V and King Philip II, and given specific assignment to work in Bicol Region. In 1585, Milaor was declared a parish under the titular patron, Saint Joseph. The first parish administrator was Fray Matias de Andrade, OFM., who arrived in Bikol in 1582 and later became the fifth Bishop of the Diocese of Nueva Caceres. The Franciscans, Fray Juan del Sacramento and Fray Jose dela Virgen, initiated the construction of a church made of bricks and stones. This was built in a place known today as \\"Sinimbahanan\\" now a part of Cabusao, where ruins of the concrete foundation may still be found. Frequent attacks from the cimarrones and the tulisanes from nearby Mount Isarog, however, caused the transfer of the church to its present site. Fray Santiago de San Pedro de Alcantara completed the construction in 1730 and added a convent made of wooden materials in 1735. Both the church and the convent were destroyed by fire in 1740 and immediately the reconstruction was undertaken by Fray Francisco delos Santos, OFM. The present belfry was finished in 1840. Milaor was formerly called \\"Milaud\\" or \\"may-laud\\". \\"Laud\\" means a lowland prone to being flooded, in fact that is being true up to this day. The expression \\"mapa-laud\\" means to go to a place which is low or with water, in other words, to go to a \\"laud\\". From \\"Milaud\\" or \\"Maylaud\\" it was transferred to \\"Milaor\\". The truth of this matter of the place being always filled with water is corroborated by the fact that in many barangays are to be found shells which thrive on water. These shell fossils mean that in ancient time this place was really covered with water or is frequently flooded to allow these shells or mollusks to thrive in the place. Originally, Milaor comprised Palestina and the present parishes of Minalabac, San Fernando and Gainza. Until the eve following the uprising Naga City on September 19, 1898 during the Philippine Revolution, the Franciscan considered Milaor as their favorite resting place and abode away from the adjacent rapidly developing settlement that is Naga City today.

According to the , it has a population of people. History The municipality of Ocampo traced its existence as the former “Mission de Mabatobato” launched by the Franciscan friars in 1735. The place was named “Mabatobato” because of the presence of huge rocks scattered all over the place believed to have erupted from Mt. Isarog. As a mission, it has four barrios; Ayugan, Tinablanan, Pinit and Moriones. In the early 1800s, people from neighboring towns began to flock the area to settle and till the vast areas of lands suited for agriculture. The place began to flourish that the people began to dream of transforming the settlement into a new municipality. Cabeza de Barangay Michael Alcantara and Don Jose Barangbang requested and pleaded to the Bishop of Caceres to make the barrio into a town. The request was granted. In 1917, Mabatobato was annexed to the municipality of Pili to help it recover from the Spanish–American War and for effective governance. By 1922 it was made into a new parish. Baptisms and burials were first recorded that year. The place began to flourish again and influx of immigrants from neighboring towns as well as from Batangas and Tayabas were observed. After three decades, the leaders and the people of Mabatobato began to clamor for independence and to govern themselves once again. In 1948, during the incumbency of Congressman Sebastian C. Moll, Jr., 2nd District Camarines Sur, the dream to separate had been brewed.

History The port of Pasacao Pasacao was the slumbering \\"visita\\" and served as the only existing port of the Bicol Region. The Spaniards who set foot in Bicol late in 16th century noted the importance of the visita in their exploration. Pasacao became a strategic defense port against the raids by Moro pirates from 1585 to 19th century. Due to frequent raids the town had an estimated population of only 200 in 1823. Vessels carrying goods and passengers made their starts or stop over here. Notwithstanding the rough road to Pamplona, this town has been contributing to, a large degree, in the economic development of the province of the Camarines Sur in particular. Pasacao's strategic location along the rugged coast of the vast expanse of the Ragay Gulf in the east made it very important to the economic and social life of the people of the region. It is for the reason that a parish was established dedicated to the Saint Rose of Lima as the patroness. Annually in the honor of the town patroness, a fiesta is celebrated on August 30. It is said that the geography of Pasacao makes its history full of hardships, troubles and affliction that influenced the customs, traditions and way of life of the inhabitants. The continued Moro piracy likes that one in 4 October 1779 at Caranan. The report of Bishop Manuel dela Concepcion described these raids in his letter to the King on June 29, 1758 as \\"undoubtedly greater at any other time.\\" (Raids in 1757). The raids according to Domingo Abella-Bikol Annals, \\"ten towns and two missions were completely destroyed; ten churches were looted and burned; about 8,000 indios were captured or killed; one priest was killed, two captured, and the capital Caceres, was under alert one night. Alcalde Jacinto Rodriguez Morales provided material for a baluarte (earthwork or fortified rampant) as defense of Pasacao against these raids. He also issued rations to bantayes (watchmen, sentinels). The port of Pasacao is rich in stories on how it got its present name. Since the part is a bustling area, dockguards were stationed to maintain peace and order. These guards would usually shout \\"Pasa ikaw, Pasa ikaw\\" as instructions to passengers. This Spanish-Tagalog mixed up \\"pasa-ikaw\\" was mistaken by the passengers as the name of the place - Pasacao. Another story went around that fisherman who was asked by a Spanish sentry what were the contents of his basket. The fisherman answered \\"pasa-pasa\\", the name of the fish, and simultaneously offered some by saying \\"ikaw\\" meaning to say if he wanted some. The sentry on the other hand interpreted the words \\"Pasa-pasa ikaw\\" as the name of the place. For long, the place was known among the soldiers as Pasa-pasa ikaw until it shortened to a more convenient Pasacao. The town's name was also said to have been derived from \\"Pasok kayo\\". This came from a native as an answer to a Spanish soldier's query of the name of the place. Misunderstanding clouded the native's remark when he meant to say that the soldier come up or come in. In a similar story as the first story, Pasacao came from \\"Pasa ikaw\\". Some Spanish settlers while walking along the shore met a native. The settlers asked the native to pass on by saying \\"Pasa\\". The native, on the other hand, wanted the Spaniards to go first by saying \\"ikaw\\". Through a convenient usage, it became Pasacao. Still another story gives credence to the word \\"Pasangkay\\" as the origin of the town's name. The travelers and traders often used it en route to Manila to ask owners of the sailboats along the shore of the village to let them ride. Pasangkay means the request of the people to get into the boat to travel. From the above-mentioned short atories, the name of the town Pasacao must have been derived from them. The Fil-American or Spanish law recognizing the legal existence of Pasacao believes. Church records however say that the founding of the church was 1885. Very few people of Pasacao except the old during the governorship of Juan de Silva (1609–1626) two galleons (Manila-Acapulco trade) were constructed in the astillero at the Lupaon (or Dalupaon nowadays) Pasacao. They were Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe and the Angel dele Guardia. According to our BiKol historian Jose Calleja Reyes, the galleon \\"Guadalupe\\" figured both in the galleon trade between Manila and Acapulco and in the defense of the Philippines against Dutch incursion in the naval battle of Playa Honda. Other important historical events that unfolded the Pasacao still left them landmark. The Pasacao Pier was the dockyard of the Japanese ships when it was bombed. Until now some of the Japanese ships can be seen under clear waters. The first place where the AMerican landed is the Magtabid Beach in Pasacao. American air transportation first landed in Tinalmud with their Grasshoppers in 1945. The Pasacao seashore was the place where the Six Daughters of Charity (nuns) landed from Spain to establish the first normal school for girls which is now the Colegio de Santa Isabel in Naga City. These and many other events took place in this town. During the early American school administrators used this port as their landing. When going to manila they had to sail from here. With no roads from Naga City they used to be carried in the hammock by hired men traversing the mountain trails. In spite of the importance of Pasacao- Pamplona road the authorities have been slow improving it. It took three days on foot from Pasacao to Naga back and forth during the late 19th century. Demographics Pasacao town hall Pier of Pasacao In the , the population of Pasacao was people, with a density of . =Language= While Tagalog is the national language of the Philippines and English is common to the business sectors, these languages are rarely spoken as a medium of communication in Pasacao.

Pueblo de San Fernando separated from Milaor and was established as an independent pueblo on 1 January 1813. The residents of this old settlement were noted for their religious devotion as manifested by their honor and dedication to San Fernando, the town's patron saint. This patron of San Fernando, according to historical records, was however not the original patron saint for whom the first settlers built the chapel. They actually built a chapel in honor of their patron saint San Fernando. However, for some unusual reasons, the image was lost after it had been transferred into the newly erected chapel. It was said that efforts were wielded to find the missing icon but it all ended into great frustration as the lost image of San Fernando was not found. One resident from the old site where the image was housed later informed the people of San Fernando that the image returned to its original location. With this incident, the Teniente del Barrio then decided to install the image of another saint, Saint John the Baptist. Their celebration of the town and parish fiesta is held every 24 June.

Years back, the municipality of Siruma was under the jurisdiction of Quipayo, considered to be one of the oldest parishes in the Archdiocese of Nueva Caceres. Now, Quipayo is a barangay of Calabanga town. On October 19, 1846, a decree was implemented by Governor General Narciso Claveria which restructured the territorial domain of the province. It was during this time that Siruma was ceded to Camarines Norte. It was said that the town's name was derived from the name of an island called \\"Matandang Siruma\\". The word \\"siruma\\" comes from the local vernacular sirum which is a \\"small, red ant\\". A myth was told that a certain capitan encountered a swarm of small red ants during his overnight stay in one of the places in Siruma, thus, calling the place as \\"masirum\\".

According to the , it has a population of people. It is in the eastern part of the province of Camarines Sur, between Mount Isarog and the Lagonoy Gulf, and occupies a total land area of 12,575 ha., 80% of which is flat. Of these, 1,045 hectare are irrigated riceland. Tigaon's economy is based on agricultural products like rice, corn, sugar cane, abaca fiber, fish, and pork. It is also known for its cottage industry, especially high quality ships-in-bottles. The main tourist attractions are the Mt. Isarog Jungle Park at Barangay Concocep and several beach resorts. History According to a certain parish priest, Fr. Marcos de Lisboa, the name of the town was attributed to the word \\"tigaw\\", a shrub grew in abundance on the river banks, and whose leaves when pounded produced extracts which were used as poison to catch fish in rivers and swamps. = Spanish Colonial Era = The Bicol Peninsula was first sighted by the Spaniards in August 1543 aboard the San Juan de Letran. In 1574, Captain Juan de Salcedo conquered the Bicol Region. In 1701, Tigaon was considered a sitio of Sagñay. In 1794, Tigaon was given her own parish under Fray Jose de Buensalida who carried the mission of St. Clare of Assisi, marking August 12 as her feastday. Mayon Volcano's eruption in 1834 started a wave of migration from the neighboring province of Albay to the rich verdant slopes of Tigaon. As the Sword and the Cross became the bedrock of Spanish colonization in the Philippines, the parish priest symbolized the King of Spain and wielded immense power. This resulted in turmoil and continuous revolts against the atrocities of Spanish rule, thereby leading to the Philippine Revolution of 1898. For $20,000,000.00, Spain ceded the Philippines to the Americans. In the early years of the 19th century, Camarines Sur was divided into four districts by the Spaniards. This division include the districts of Bikol, Rinconanda, Yraya and Mambulao. The mission of Tigaon in the part of Mount Isarog belonged to the Bikol district. The history of this town, according to written accounts, was considered to be confusing as there are conflicting records with regards to its establishment as a municipality. = World War II and Japanese Occupation = In 1941, the Second World War broke. The Japanese entered Tigaon during the term of Mayor Lino Cabaero. The guerrilla movement evolved as an offshoot of Japanese cruelty. Clashes were frequent and the church became a sanctuary of most guerrillas. Fr. Tomas Bernales was parish priest during the period 1941−1942. Fr. Florencio Gonzales took over in 1942. The infamous Death March propelled Doña Leonor Moll to rescue her son, Dr. Heriberto Moll and forty other Bicolanos from the clutches of death. Lt. Salvador Natividad died fighting the Japanese at Mabalodbalod. Captain Edmundo Cea and Majors Salvador and Tomas Garchitorena were at the forefront of battle. Don Pascual Leelin freely disposed his sacks of rice to fellow- Tigaoeños before enemies could confiscate them. In 1945, American forces came back to reclaim the Philippines, thus paving the way for the surrender of the beleaguered Japanese Imperial Army. = Independent Philippines = With the advent of independence, Tigaoeños found freedom of expression through the arts. A monopoly of painters, poets, and actors emerged from this town. Luisita Venida was the first Tigaoeña child actress while Jesus ‘Og’ Ramos became the Tarzan of local cinema. Bodybuilder Pepito Ramos was acclaimed “Mr. Philippines”. In the late fifties, Batas Pambansa 129 made Tigaon the seat of the CFI in Partido District. Politics thrived. Don Mariano Garchitorena became Governor of Camarines Sur in 1945. Sebastian Caruso Moll was elected Congressman under the Quirino administration. The same administration chose Don Mariano Garchitorena Secretary of Agriculture. Edmundo Cea, the first Asian to be invited as guest speaker to the United Nations, gained fame as a Congressman, then Senator during the sixties, as a delegate to the 1970 Constitutional Convention and as a member of the defunct Batasang Pambansa. Jose Fuentebella was Ambassador to Indonesia during the Garcia administration. Parish Priest Fr. Florencio Gonzales was succeeded by Fr. Pedro Oliva (1948−1967). Municipal mayors of Tigaon during these years: Heriberto R. Moll (1945-1957); Jose Bosito (1958-1964) and again Heriberto R. Moll (1964−1967). There was a time when Tigaon was solely owned by 7 hacienderos namely P. Baduria, L. Cea, J. Jacob, M. Estela, A. Garchitorena and S. Moll. Now their lands was distributed to the people through the Agrarian Reform. = Martial Law = The NPA Movement in the Bicol Region started in Tigaon which at best typified a feudal society. Brothers Romulo (Kumander Tangkad) and Ruben (Kumander Benjie) Jallores actively guided the growth of this movement. Agrarian unrest became the legitimate cause for the fuelling of socialist ideology. Tenants forcibly planted rice and corn within abaca lands. Eventually, abaca production declined. In 1972, martial law was declared. Agrarian Reform was implemented. Felix Fuentebella was appointed governor in 1976, the same year Nelson Baduria Tria was ordained and became the first Tigaoeño priest. The Marcos dictatorship hunted down insurgents and tortured them. Senator Edmundo Cea took the cudgels for Ninoy Aquino's widow, Corazon. The church played an important role in the series of events that was to lead to the overthrow of Ferdinand Marcos in the EDSA Revolution of 1986. Tigaon's St. Clare of Assisi Parish became the rallying point of Cory Aquino's cause in Camarines Sur's third district. Parish priests in Tigaon were Fr. Jose Rey (1967−1984) and Fr. Felix Barela (1984−1985). In 1986, Gallardo Bombase, Jr. was ordained. He became the first Filipino parish priest of the University of Santo Tomas. Municipal Mayors during this time: Gualberto Cea Manlagñit (1968−1971); Lucio Palaypayon, Jr. (1972); Federico Moll (acting capacity, 1973−1976); and Claudio Francisco (appointed 1976/ elected 1980−1986). Gradually, order was restored. The Senate and Congress were once again part of the country's democratic process. Delfin Recto was appointed Mayor of Tigaon. Julian Cea Napal became Vice Governor of Camarines Sur. Francis Garchitorena occupied the position of SandiganBayan Justice. The crusade of the NPA Movement gained recognition from the ruling administration. Continuing peace talks were held to resolve the differences between government and the CPP/NPA. The democratic form of government once more dominated the political scene. Municipal Mayors were: Roman de Leon, Jr. (OIC, 1987, Transitional Gov’t); and Eleanor R. Lelis (1988−1992). Arnulfo Fuentebella, elected in 1992, held the congressional seat for Camarines Sur's third district. Parish priests were Fr. Alfonso Grageda (1985−1991) and Fr. Eutiquio Infante (1991−1997). = Recent Years = Once more, Tigaon is on the move. Municipal Mayor Mariano B. Llaguno (1992−1998) was succeeded by Mayor Elmo L. Bombase while Fr. Danilo Tuason became Parish Priest of Tigaon. The Sword and Cross have never been apart in the Tigaoeño way of life. Hand in hand with the construction of the Parish rectory was Tigaon's new municipal building. After a nine-year term, Mayor Bombase was succeeded by Mayor Arnie Fuentebella (2007–present). The Rev. Msgr. Juan Celzo, Fr. Rodolfo Sales and incumbent parish priest Fr. Noel Emmanuel Alforte were assigned successively to continue the church's mission in Tigaon.

One of these languages in the Isarog Agta language which has an estimated speaker of 5 people in the year 2000. The language was classified as Critically Endangered, meaning the youngest speakers are grandparents and older, and they speak the language partially and infrequently and hardly pass the language to their children and grandchildren anymore. If the remaining 150 people do not pass their native language to the next generation of Isarog Agta people, their indigenous language will be extinct within a period of 1 to 2 decades. The Isarog Agta people live within the circumference of Mount Isarog, though only 5 of them still know their indigenous language. They are one of the original Negrito settlers in the entire Philippines. They belong to the Aeta people classification, but have distinct language and belief systems unique to their own culture and heritage. =Religion= Roman Catholicism first emerged in 1794 with the birth of its town.

The Ket (), also known in its upper reaches as the Bolshaya Ket () is a west-flowing river in the Krasnoyarsk Krai and Tomsk Oblast in Russia, a right tributary of the Ob. The Ket has a length of and a drainage basin of . It freezes up in late October or early November and stays under the ice until late April or early May. Its main tributaries are the Sochur, Orlovka and Lisitsa from the right, Malaya Ket, Mendel, Yelovaya, and Chachamga from the left.Кеть, Great Soviet Encyclopedia The Ket once served as one of the main river routes in Siberia. A portage near its headwaters allowed one to cross from the Ob River basin to the Yenisei basin. The Russians established a fort at Ketsk a few miles above the Ob in 1602 and another at Makovsk near the head of navigation in 1618. Makovsk was also called Makarskoi Fort or Makovskaya Pristan (Makovsk Landing). The portage east to Yeniseysk, one of the longest portages in Siberia, was called the Makarskoi Portage.Clifford M Foust,'Muscovite and Mandarin', 1968, page 100 When John BellJohn Bell, \\"Travels from St Petersburg in Russia to diverse parts of Asia\\", Edinburgh, 1806, pages 377-380) sailed down the Ket in August 1722 he compared it to the River Styx. He complained about the crookedness, sandbars, mosquitos, lack of inhabitants and the tall trees and brambles on both sides which made it gloomy. His voyage from Makovsk to the Ob took 25 days. In the late 19th-century the Ket-Kas Canal connected the Ket with the Greater Kas River which flows into the Yenisei. This project made the Ket a part of a waterway system connecting the Ob River basin with the Yenisei. But the canal - shallow, long, inconveniently located, and frozen for the greater part of the year - proved uncompetitive with the Trans- Siberian Railway, and was abandoned around 1921.

Ifugao Rice Terraces Sometimes called by locals as the \\"Eighth Wonder of the World\\", the Ifugao Rice Terraces begin at the base of the mountain range and extend several thousand feet upwards. Two of the terrace clusters in Banaue, namely Bangaan and Batad, are part of the UNESCO World Heritage inscription. It is said that their length, if put end to end, would encircle half of the globe. The terraces are believed by many to be more than 2,000 years old as postulated by early Philippine anthropologist Otley Beyer, recent studies by carbon dating however contends this and instead the structures may be less than 1,000 years old. The rice terraces manifest the engineering skill and ingenuity of the sturdy Ifugaos. They are irrigated by means of mountain streams and springs that have been tapped and channelled into canals that run downhill through the rice terraces. Banaue Rice Terraces Batad Rice Terraces paddy fields Banaue Museum, which includes artifacts collected by H. Otley Beyer The rice terraces once stretched north-east to Cagayan and as far south as Quezon. However they are now slowly being abandoned and showing signs of deterioration. The 1990 Luzon earthquake damaged some of the terraces' irrigation systems, while El Niño triggered droughts that led giant earthworms to erode the terraces' soil. Furthermore, the rice variety most suited to the area's cool climate is not a high-yielding crop; because it takes so long to mature, some Ifugao families have abandoned their land in the rice terraces in favour of land that reaps faster rewards. An Ifugao Terraces Commission was created in 1994 and was superseded by the Banaue Rice Terraces task force, which was closed in 2002. UNESCO has listed the Batad Rice Terraces and Bangaan Rice Terraces as a World Heritage Site since 1995, under the designation, Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras.Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras, UNESCO World Heritage Site. All located in the Ifugao region, the Rice Terraces also feature as one of the Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems or GIAHS. They are supported by indigenous knowledge management of muyong, a private forest that caps each terrace cluster. The muyong is managed through a collective effort and under traditional tribal practices. The communally managed forestry area on top of the terraces contains about 264 indigenous plant species, mostly endemic to the region. The terraces form unique clusters of microwatersheds and are part of the whole mountain ecology. They serve as a rainwater filtration system and are saturated with irrigation water all year round. A biorhythm technology, in which cultural activities are harmonised with the rhythm of climate and hydrology management, has enabled farmers to grow rice at over 1 000 metres. Contrary to popular notion, the Banaue Rice Terraces as seen from the viewpoint are not included in the UNESCO inscription, due to the presence of numerous modern structures. However, it is a National Cultural Treasure under the Ifugao Rice Terraces. The Banaue Rice Terraces were chosen as one of the two green globe destinations of the country by the World Travel and Tour Council. It received an “International Historic Engineering Landmark Award” from the American Society of Civil Engineers. It was also acknowledged by the World Travel and Tour Council as a green globe destination in the Philippines.Banaue, e-philippines.

She was the first gymnast from Great Britain to compete in two Olympic Games, in 1996 and 2000. Reeder began gymnastics at the age of three in 1982, following in the footsteps of her sister Kirsty. She trained at the South Essex Gym Club under coach Rod Smith. She made her international debut at the 1993 Junior European Championships and entered the senior ranks in the following year. In 1994 in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada Reeder became England's youngest ever Commonwealth Games gold medallist at the age of fourteen, collecting golds in the team and the floor exercise. She collected a third gold medal at the Commonwealths in 1998. Reeder was also a European floor finalist in 1994, and a vault finalist in 1998. In the 1996 European Championships in Birmingham, Reeder finished 14th in the all-around, the highest ranking recorded for a British athlete at the time. Reeder represented the UK at the 1994 team, 1994 individual, 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1999 World Championships. She was a two time Champion and four time silver medalist at British Nationals and the English Champion in 1996. Great Britain did not qualify to send a full team to the 1996 Olympics, but were permitted to send two gymnasts to compete as individuals. Reeder was the higher-ranked of the two British gymnasts, placing 66th in the prelims. At the 2000 Olympics in Sydney Australia, Reeder captained the British women's team. The squad finished 10th, its best Olympic placement ever. Annika qualified to the all-around finals, the culmination of a lifetime's ambition. However, her bid to compete in the all-around would be undone by the infamous vault fiasco. Prior to the all-around, unbeknownst to the athletes and coaches, the vaulting horse was set 2 inches (5 cm) too low. This completely altered gymnasts' pre and post-flight, and resulted in many crashes, falls and injuries. Reeder vaulted on the faulty apparatus and was, perhaps, the worst affected by the error. She was so injured on her vault attempts that she had to be helped off the mats and was forced to withdraw from the remainder of the competition. Eponymous skill Following the 1999 World Championships, the FIG (Federation of International Gymnastics) added all the new elements into the Code of Points. Only a few gymnasts had their name added, but the uprise full turn or uprise 1½ turn was officially named the \\"Reeder.\\" Reeder was the first British gymnast to achieve this honour. The skill has a difficulty value of \\"D,\\" in the 2013-2016 Women's Code of Points.

The musical was never staged and the song was instead released in September 1970 as part of the Byrds' (Untitled) album. It was later issued as a single, peaking at number 121 on the Billboard singles chart and number 19 on the UK Singles Chart. Composition Throughout most of 1969, the Byrds' leader and guitarist, Roger McGuinn, had been writing songs with psychologist and Broadway impresario Jacques Levy for a country rock stage production of Henrik Ibsen's Peer Gynt that the pair were developing. The intended title for the musical was Gene Tryp, an anagram of the title of Ibsen's play. McGuinn and Levy's production was to loosely follow the storyline of Peer Gynt, albeit with some modifications to transpose the story from Norway to south-west America during the mid-19th century. Ultimately, the Gene Tryp stage production was abandoned and among the twenty-six songs that McGuinn and Levy had written for the project, six (including \\"Chestnut Mare\\") would end up being released on the Byrds' (Untitled) and Byrdmaniax albums. \\"Chestnut Mare\\" was intended to be used during a scene in which the play's eponymous hero attempts to catch and tame a wild horse, a scene that had featured a deer in Ibsen's original. While the majority of \\"Chestnut Mare\\" had been written specifically for Gene Tryp, the musical accompaniment to the song's Bach-like middle section had actually been written by McGuinn back in the early 1960s, while on tour in South America with the Chad Mitchell Trio. Musically, \\"Chestnut Mare\\" echoes the sound of the Byrds' mid-1960s recordings, with McGuinn's chiming 12-string Rickenbacker guitar sitting alongside guitarist Clarence White's country-style acoustic and electric guitar picking. Lyrically, the song's spoken verses recount the story of one man's quest to tame a wild horse, and, as such, it echoes the familiar Byrds' themes of nature and freedom. Byrds expert Tim Connors has also suggested that the song's narrative can be seen to deal in mythic archetypes: the wild mare being an embodiment of untamed nature, which the narrator wants to control, and thus an analogy of mankind's attempts to dominate and subjugate the natural environment. Release and reception \\"Chestnut Mare\\" was initially released as part of the Byrds' (Untitled) album on September 14, 1970. It was then issued as a single on October 23, 1970, with \\"Just a Season\\", another McGuinn and Levy song left over from the Gene Tryp project, on the B-side. The single stalled at number 121 on the Billboard singles chart, but nonetheless, \\"Chestnut Mare\\" went on to become a staple of FM radio programming in America during the 1970s. The song did much better, however, when it was released as a single in the United Kingdom on January 1, 1971, reaching number 19 on the UK Singles Chart, during a chart stay of eight weeks. \\"Chestnut Mare\\" was the first UK Top 20 hit that the Byrds had achieved since their cover of Bob Dylan's \\"All I Really Want to Do\\" had peaked at number 4 in September 1965. Although the U.S. single release featured the full-length album version of \\"Chestnut Mare\\", in the UK and Europe a severely edited version of the song was issued instead. The running time of the album version is 5:08, while the single edit is noticeably shorter at 2:58, due to the removal of the song's second verse and middle section. Following its appearance on the (Untitled) album, the song would go on to become a staple of the Byrds' live concert repertoire, until their final disbandment in 1973. The band also performed the song in 1971 and 1972 on the German music television program, Beat-Club. In addition to its appearance on the (Untitled) album, \\"Chestnut Mare\\" appears on several Byrds' compilations, including The Best of The Byrds: Greatest Hits, Volume II, History of The Byrds, The Byrds, The Very Best of The Byrds, The Essential Byrds, and There Is a Season. A live performance of the song is also included on The Byrds' Live at Royal Albert Hall 1971 album. The Icicle Works covered \\"Chestnut Mare\\" as a medley with another Byrds' song, \\"Triad\\", on the 1989 Byrds' tribute album, Time Between – A Tribute to The Byrds.

He is currently a member of the Chamber of Deputies from the first electoral region to the LXIII Legislature of the Mexican Congress.SIL: Profile of Enrique Jackson (LXIII Legislature) (in Spanish) Life Jackson was born in Los Mochis, Sinaloa. He studied for, but never received, a bachelor's degree in Public Administration from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and started a career in the federal bureaucracy and the PRI. He joined the party in 1970 and began his civil service career in the 1970s in agencies such as IDECO (1973–74) and the Secretariat of Labor (1977–83). Between 1983 and 1985, he was the director general of Liconsa, then a chapter of the Compañía Nacional de Subsistencias Populares (CONASUPO), which produced and distributed milk for social welfare programs. From mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, before the introduction of direct elections of local officials in Mexico City, Jackson was appointed chief administrator (delegado) of Mexico City's Cuauhtémoc borough (1985–1988), took charge of the Federal District's security office (1988) and headed the public transportation authority (1989–1990). In 1998, he became the Federal District's secretary of government. Additionally, Jackson had a lengthy career in the PRI; he bounced around between many different positions, including director of the party's Institute for Political, Economic and Social Studies (1981), president of the PRI in the Federal District (1990–92), and president of Fundación Colosio, A.C. (1995). =Legislative career= Jackson was elected to the Chamber of Deputies for the first time in 1997, for the LVII Legislature. He was the president of the first Political Coordination Board and sat on commissions dealing with the Federal District, Government, Constitutional Points, and National Defense, as well as an investigative commission that looked into the operations of CONASUPO. Three years later, Jackson headed to the Senate for the LVIII and LIX Legislatures, where he presided over the Board of Directors and the Political Coordination Board, making him one of the highest-ranking PRI members in the Senate. During the first months of 2005, he participated in the PRI presidential primaries. After 15 years, the PRI returned Jackson to San Lázaro as a proportional representation deputy from the first electoral region, representing his home state of Sinaloa, to the Chamber of Deputies to the LXIII Legislature. He sits on three commissions: Bicameral for National Security, National Defense, and Navy, and is the PRI's vice coordinator in the Chamber of Deputies. Additionally, he was designated as a representative from the Chamber of Deputies to the Constituent Assembly of Mexico City, which will convene from September 2016 to January 2017. His selection came after the naming of another PRI proportional representation deputy, Carmen Salinas, prompted significant backlash.

It is not comprehensive. Ancient history and Middle Ages *By some interpretations, predominantly those of Japanese scholars, an ancient stone monument (the Gwanggaeto Stele) erected in honor of the Goguryeo King Gwanggaeto in 414, records that in 391, the Yamato kingdom sent an invasion force against an alliance between the ancient Korean kingdoms of Baekje and Silla and defeated both armies. Later Baekje became a Japanese ally in further fighting on the Korean peninsula. *During the Yamato Empire period in the 6th century the Yamato state participated in the armed struggles between the three Korean peninsular kingdoms of Goguryeo, Baekje and Silla. The 7th-century Japanese history Nihon Shoki claims Japan acquired the territory of Mimana, or Karak, with its capital at Nihonpu). This claim is disputed by Korean historians due to a lack of evidence in non-Japanese histories. In any case, Yamato Japan did foster close relations with the Baekje state but in 562 they were effectively expelled from peninsular affairs by an increasingly powerful Silla state. Again, Japanese sources claim that at various times Yamato Japan attempted to recover its erstwhile Korean possessions but were repeatedly defeated by the Koreans, namely Silla. In 663 Silla, allied with Tang China and destroyed the Japanese naval fleet along the Korean coast. Silla's final defeat of Baekje and Goguryeo and its unification of the peninsula ended Japanese territorial ambitions, such as they were, on the peninsula for nearly a millennium. *The Japanese ruler Toyotomi Hideyoshi launched an attempt to conquer Ming China in 1591 with an invasion of Korea, but was defeated, in large part as a result of naval defeats at the hands of the Korean admiral Yi Sunshin. The Japanese invaded again in 1597-1598. *Also during Hideyoshi's reign, in 1574, a Chinese pirate and navigator, Si-Ma Hong, arrived at Mariveles in the Philippines. His second chief Shioko, disembarked at Parañaque with 600 seamen, who were Japanese. His intent was to take Manila, but he was defeated by the Spanish. *Years later another Japanese navigator and buccaneer with the name Tayfusan or Taizufu captured Cagayan. 19th century *In the early 19th century, samurai expeditions to the Asian mainland skirmished with Russian, Chinese, and Mongol forces. *The Chinese- Japanese War occurred in 1894-1895. *The Boxer Rebellion 20th century *The Russian-Japanese War occurred in 1904-1905. **The first attempted Japanese invasion of Russian territory was led by Gungi, a soldier and local settler of Shumushu. He led a minor invasion group from Shumushu, which disembarked on the Cape Lopatka area in Kamchatka. **During the same war, a Japanese fleet bombarded Vladivostok's fortifications and immediately retired from the area. This was part of a plan to capture them, but the plan was suspended. *Japan acquired the Liaotung Peninsula, South Manchurian Railway Zone, and Karafuto island in 1905. *Japan annexed Korea in 1905-1910. *Japanese actions during the First World War: **Japanese ships bombarded and landed troops in German controlled territory in the Kirchow (Kiaochow) German, and landed some troops in the German Pacific islands territories, in Micronesia. **In the same period, Japanese forces took the Rabaul bases in the Admiralty Islands in the New Guinea area and defeated the German naval force of Admiral Von Spee, who ordered a withdrawal to the East Pacific area. **At the same time, Japanese landed from Formosa and took for a while the Chinese province of Fujian, also promoting some revolts against the Chinese central government. **Following ancient claims to the Hawaii islands and its area, the Imperial Japanese Navy sent the Warship \\"Asama Maru\\" and other vessels to U.S. and Mexican Pacific coasts on secret missions before and during WWI. The \\"Asama\\" patrolled in the Gulf of California (Cortes Sea) in April 1915. According to some reports of Native American watchers in Arizona and an American Army secret expedition to the Mexican Sonora Desert, some Naval infantry landed from these Japanese vessels and patrolled in the Sonora and Arizona before returning to their vessels. There were some rumors of Imperial Japanese Army or Navy officers acting as advisers to the Mexican armies of Adolfo de la Huerta, Venustiano Carranza or Pancho Villa at this time. Japan had interest in the U.S. Pacific Coasts, Mexico, Latin America and the recently constructed Panama Canal. *The Japanese took over South Pacific Mandate and territories in Shantung in 1918-1919. The Japanese claimed the New Guinea area, arguing that certain Japanese navigators had arrived in the area in ancient times. *The Japanese intervened in 1918-1925 in Siberia. **The Japanese landed at Petropavlovsk- Kamchatsky and captured of Kamchatka. Japan retained this area until 1927. **Japan gained partial control of the northern sector of Sakhalin island from 1918 until 1925. **According to some sources, Japanese intervention forces in the Russian Far East employed expeditionary groups to Central Asia and Central Western Siberia. **The establishment of the first intended puppet state in Siberia, called Republic of Far East, took place in 1918-1922. Japan administered this territory through local Russian leaders, the Cossack Ataman Semeonoff and his aide Lieutenant Kalmykoff. This was during the times of the White Russian anti-communist administration of Admiral Kolchak. These Russian leaders were under the effective control of the Japanese Army's General Ohi. **The Japanese virtually controlled the Okhotsk sea area, U.S. territory and fisheries until 1925-1927. In an agreement reached with the Soviets, Japan received some fishing rights in the area and mineral rights in North Sakhalin. **The Soviet-Japanese East Railway Incident occurred in 1929 **The Soviet revenge action in Manzhouli took place later in the same year *The Mukden Incident occurred in 1931. *The second historical Japanese foundation of a puppet state took place in Manchuria in 1932, under the name of Manchukuo, with Puyi as Head of State under the control of the Kwantung Army, representing the Imperial Japanese Army *The Japanese occupied Jehol Province in 1933, and annexed this territory to Manchukuo. *The Mongol pro-Japanese state of Mengjiang, with Denchungdongrb as its leader, was formed under Japanese Army guidance, along with other Chinese pro-Japanese governments in Hopei province *The Second Sino-Japanese War took place in 1937-1945. **On December 12, 1937, the \\"Panay incident\\" occurred.

One of them struck at ports in California, and another launched a small reconnaissance seaplane to bomb the Oregon area. Some heavy flying boats from the Marshall Islands area stuck Hawaii. An apparently diversionary invasion of the Aleutian islands in Alaska was launched, Fu-Go balloon bombs were sent to the Pacific coast. Some plans were made to attack the U.S. Pacific cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco, and to strike at the Panama Canal. The Japanese also conducted similar reconnaissance missions in Mexico, Central America and the South American Pacific coastal areas. *Japan extended its submarine long- range reconnaissance missions to the Asian and African coasts of the Indian Ocean, to Australia, New Zealand and other islands, and to the Western and South Pacific seas. *The final Japanese actions during WWII began on August 15, 1945, when Soviet forces invaded Manchukuo, Mengjiang, Karafuto, Shumushu (the last Japanese tank battle), Paramushiro and the other Chishima islands (Kuriles). Soviet paratroopers were dropped over Kwantung and began the invasion of North Korean lands. The last fierce Japanese armed resistance against Allied Forces, represented by the Red Army, was in November 1945, in the Konan (Hungnam) mountain fortress, near Genzan in the north-east area of the Korean peninsula.

It was later cut in London by the diamond cutter Harris, between 1704 and 1706. The cutting took two years and cost about £5,000 Rumours circulated that Pitt had fraudulently acquired the diamond, leading satirist Alexander Pope to pen the following lines in his Moral Essays > \\"Asleep and naked as an INDIAN lay > An honest factor stole a gem away; > He pledged it to the Knight, the Knight had wit, > So kept the diamond, and the rogue was bit.\\" Pitt bought the diamond for £20,400 (), and had it cut into a cushion brilliant. = Sale to the French Regent = After many attempts to sell it to various Members of European royalty, including Louis XIV of France, it was purchased by the French Regent, Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, in 1717 for £135,000 (), at the urging of his close friend and famed memoirist Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon. The stone was set into the crown of Louis XV for his coronation in 1722 and then into a new crown for the coronation of Louis XVI in 1775. It was also used to adorn a hat belonging to Marie Antoinette. In 1791, its appraised value was £480,000 (). In 1792, during the revolutionary furore in Paris, \\"Le Régent\\", or the regent diamond, was stolen along with other crown jewels of France, but was later recovered. It was found in some roof timbers in an attic in Paris. The diamond was used as security on several occasions by the Directoire and later the Consulat to finance the military expenses: 1797-1798 it was pledged to the Berlin Entrepreneur Sigmund Otto Joseph von Treskow and 1798-1801 to the Dutch Banker Vandenberg in Amsterdam. In 1801 the gem was permanently redeemed by Napoleon Bonaparte. Portrait of Charles X by François Gérard. Note the Regent Diamond set in the Fleur-de-lis at the top of the crown. Napoleon used it for the pommel of his sword, designed by the goldsmiths Odiot, Boutet and Marie-Etienne Nitot. In 1812 it appeared on the Emperor's two-edged sword, which was a work of Nitot. Napoleon's second wife, Archduchess Marie Louise of Austria, carried the Régent back to Austria upon his exile. Later her father returned it to the French Crown Jewels. The diamond was mounted successively on the crowns of Louis XVIII, Charles X and Napoleon III. Today, mounted in a Greek diadem designed for Empress Eugenie, it remains in the French Royal Treasury at the Louvre. It has been on display there since 1887. Experts have estimated the Regent Diamond value to be near £48,000,000. At the current 2016 exchange rate of $1.28 USD / £1, the Regent Diamond value is estimated at $61,440,000 USD.  Folklore  Due to numerous scandals, and the misfortune of those who have been in possession of the stone, the Regent Diamond is said to be cursed.  Notes  ;Bibliography * Brown, Peter Douglas.

Chair-O-Planes or \\"Kettenkarussell\\" (chain-carousel) at the Roonkarker Mart fair, Germany Around the World The swing ride or chair swing ride (sometimes called a swing carousel, wave swinger, yo-yo, Chair-O- Planes, Dodo or swinger) is an amusement ride that is a variation on the carousel in which the seats are suspended from the rotating top of the carousel. On some versions, particularly on the Wave Swingers, the rotating top of the carousel also tilts for additional variations of motion. History Swing rides were present at the earliest amusement parks. At Idora Park in Oakland, California, in 1908, the ride was called the Flying Swing, but appears to be the same principle. The Chair-O-Planes premiered in Germany in 1972, designed by Zierer and built by Franz Schwarzkopf, brother of Anton Schwarzkopf. In 1974 the first portable unit debuted under the same partnership. Since then Zierer has built about 200 units. Other manufacturers have followed creating their own versions of the Chair-O-Planes including Zamperla, Chance Rides, Grover Watkins, Bertazzon, Preston & Barbieri, Vekoma and Sanoyas Hishino Meisho. In the late 2000s, Austrian manufacturer Funtime developed the world's first tower swinger known as the Star Flyer. Mondial followed with their WindSeeker resulting in a lawsuit between the two companies. Zamperla also sells a Vertical Swing.

Denmark The Star Flyer, located in Tivoli Gardens, Copenhagen, affords sweeping views of the city's historical centre. France Les Chaises Volantes in Walibi Sud-Ouest is a Zierer model from 1987 which was relocated to the park in 1992. Netherlands Attractiepark Slagharen located the same Chair-O-Plane as Loundoun Castle. Norway Sverrehusken a Wellenflieger at TusenFryd (Norway) in 2011 Second largest amusement park in the Nordic countries is TusenFryd located outside the capital Oslo in Norway. TusenFryd is the home of a Wellenflieger named \\"Sverrehusken\\" and has been in operation since 1988. Sverrehusken is the first of its kind in the Nordic countries. In Kongeparken located 10 km outside the fourth largest city in Norway, Stavanger is the home of a Wellenflieger named \\"Spinnvidle\\" and has been in operation since 2012. Spinnvidle is the first of its kind in Norway with double seats. Sweden The Swedish name for Swing ride is Slänggunga or Kättingflygare. At Gröna Lund, Stockholm a swing ride with the name \\"Eclipse\\" can be found. With its it shares the \\"world's second tallest\\" title with SkyScreamer in Texas, North America. The biggest amusement park in the Nordic countries is Liseberg in Sweden's second largest city Gothenburg. Liseberg is the home of a Swing ride named \\"Slänggungan\\". United Kingdom Monkey Swinger with water fountains at Chessington World of Adventures Loudoun Castle Theme Park in Scotland claimed that its moon-shaped ride, \\"The Plough\\", was the largest Chair-O-Plane in the world. The Plough was originally called Apollo 14 and was owned by the Bembom family, operating in their Ponypark Slagharen in the Netherlands during the late seventies. It had gondolas travelling around the outside of the ride. When moved to Dreamland in England (then called \\"Bembom Brothers\\"), it was reconstructed into a Chair-O-Plane and named Heatwave. Leaving Dreamland, it opened in Lightwater Valley in 1998 where it operated until 2003 when Henk Bembom moved Heatwave to his new park, Loudoun Castle, where it was renamed \\"The Plough\\" and painted green. The park has been closed since 2010. Until 2016 there was a Chair-O-Plane ride at Alton Towers in Staffordshire. Called Twirling Toadstool it was set in a fantasy themed area of the park called Cloud Cukoo Land, it was themed as a giant mushroom. This was formerly themed as a prehistoric dinosaur-type ride and located in an area called Ug Land. You can also find a Chair-O-Plane at Carters Steam Fair which is one of the largest vintage travelling funfairs including some steam driven rides. Their ride's past is a little patchy but is thought to have been built in Germany in the 1920s and imported to Britain with a blank canvas. It's generally the case that British roundabouts run clockwise, whereas their Continental and American counterparts run anti- clockwise. The Chair-o-Plane certainly runs the right direction to be a British-built ride, but it may have been adapted by an early owner. Adventure Island has a Chair-O-Plane called Archelon, which was themed to the extinct species of turtle of the same name. Chessington World of Adventures is home to a monkey-themed Chair-O-Planes, named the 'Monkey Swinger', that squirts water at riders. This formerly had a theme based on Billy Whizz of The Beano. Paultons Park is also home to a Chair-O-Planes called 'The Sky Swinger'. This ride opened in 2008 and is a Zierer model. Butlins is home to three Chair-O- Planes, one at each site located at Butlins Minehead, Butlins Bognor Regis ans Butlins Skegness. Butlins Minehead is home to a Zierer Wave Swinger and the other two resorts manufacturers are unknown. =North America= Playland, Vancouver, BC, Canada The Gunslinger ride at Six Flags Over Texas The WindSeeker at several Cedar Fair parks.

Written between 1629 and 1633, it contains a nearly complete version of his philosophy, from method, to metaphysics, to physics and biology. Descartes espoused mechanical philosophy, a form of natural philosophy popular in the 17th century. He thought everything physical in the universe to be made of tiny \\"corpuscles\\" of matter. Corpuscularianism is closely related to atomism. The main difference was that Descartes maintained that there could be no vacuum, and all matter was constantly swirling to prevent a void as corpuscles moved through other matter. The World presents a corpuscularian cosmology in which swirling vortices explain, among other phenomena, the creation of the Solar System and the circular motion of planets around the Sun. The World rests on the heliocentric view, first explicated in Western Europe by Copernicus. Descartes delayed the book's release upon news of the Roman Inquisition's conviction of Galileo for \\"suspicion of heresy\\" and sentencing to house arrest. Descartes discussed his work on the book, and his decision not to release it, in letters with another philosopher, Marin Mersenne. Some material from The World was revised for publication as Principia philosophiae or Principles of Philosophy (1644), a Latin textbook at first intended by Descartes to replace the Aristotelian textbooks then used in universities. In the Principles the heliocentric tone was softened slightly with a relativist frame of reference. The last chapter of The World was published separately as De Homine (On Man) in 1662. The rest of The World was finally published in 1664, and the entire text in 1677.  The void and particles in nature  Before Descartes begins to describe his theories in physics, he introduces the reader to the idea that there is no relationship between our sensations and what creates these sensations, thereby casting doubt on the Aristotelian belief that such a relationship existed. Next he describes how fire is capable of breaking wood apart into its minuscule parts through the rapid motion of the particles of fire within the flames. This rapid motion of particles is what gives fire its heat, since Descartes claims heat is nothing more than just the motion of particles, and what causes it to produce light. According to Descartes, the motion, or agitation, of these particles is what gives substances their properties (i.e. their fluidity and hardness). Fire is the most fluid and has enough energy to render most other bodies fluid whereas the particles of air lack the force necessary to do the same. Hard bodies have particles that are all equally hard to separate from the whole. Based on his observations of how resistant nature is to a vacuum, Descartes deduced that all particles in nature are packed together such that there is no void or empty space in nature (however, Descartes makes it clear that he does not claim that a void cannot exist in nature, since he lacks the observations necessary to say this with certainty). Descartes describes substances as consisting only of three elementary elements: fire, air and earth, from which the properties of any substance can be characterized by its composition of these elements, the size and arrangement of the particles in the substance, and the motion of its particles.  Cartesian laws of motion  The motion of these particles and all other objects in nature are subject to the laws of motion Descartes had observed: # “…each particular part of matter always continues in the same state unless collision with others forces it to change its state.” # “…when one of these bodies pushes another, it cannot give the 2nd any motion, except by losing as much of its own motion at the same time…” # “…when a body is moving…each of its parts individually tends always to continue moving along a straight line” (Gaukroger) Descartes in Principles of Philosophy added to these his laws on elastic collision.  The Cartesian universe  Descartes elaborates on how the universe could have started from utter chaos and with these basic laws could have had its particles arranged so as to resemble the universe we observe today. Once the particles in the chaotic universe began to move, the overall motion would have been circular because there is no void in nature, so whenever a single particle moves, another particle must also move to occupy the space where the previous particle once was. This type of circular motion, or vortex, would have created what Descartes observed to be the orbits of the planets about the sun with the heavier objects spinning out towards the outside of the vortex and the lighter objects remaining closer to the center. To explain this, Descartes used the analogy of a river that carried both floating debris (leaves, feathers, etc.) and heavy boats. If the river abruptly arrived at a sharp bend, the boats would follow Descartes third law of motion and hit the shore of the river since the flow of the particles in the river would not have enough force to change the direction of the boat. However, the much lighter floating debris would follow the river since the particles in the river would have sufficient force to change the direction of the debris. In the heavens, it’s the circular flow of celestial particles, or aether, that causes the motion of the planets to be circular. As to the reason why heavy objects on Earth fall, Descartes explained this through the agitation of the particles in the atmosphere. The particles of the aether have greater agitation than the particles of air, which in turn have greater agitation than the particles that compose terrestrial objects (e.g. stones). The greater agitation of the aether prevents the particles of air from escaping into the heavens, just as the agitation of air particles forces terrestrial bodies, whose particles have far less agitation than those of air, to descend towards the world.  Cartesian theory on light  With his laws of motion set forth and the universe operating under these laws, Descartes next begins to describe his theory on the nature of light. Descartes believed that light traveled instantaneously - a common belief at the time – as an impulse across all the adjacent particles in nature, since Descartes believed nature was without a void. To illustrate this, Descartes used the example of a stick being pushed against some body. Just as the force which is felt at one end of the stick is instantly transferred and felt at the other end, so is the impulse of light that is sent across the heavens and through the atmosphere from luminous bodies to our eyes. Descartes attributed light to have 12 distinct properties: #Light extends circularly in all direction from luminous bodies #Light extends out to any distance #Light travels instantaneously #Light travels ordinarily in straight lines or rays #Several rays can come from different points and meet at the same point #Several rays can start at the same point and travel in different directions #Several rays can pass through the same point without impeding each other #If the rays are of very unequal force, then they can sometimes impede one another Also: * 9) and 10) Rays can be diverted by reflection or by refraction * 11) and 12) The force of a ray can be augmented or diminished by the disposition of the matter that receives it.

Col. Pusapati Vijay Ananda Gajapathi Raju (28 December 1905 – 2 December 1965), better known as the Maharajkumar of Vizianagram or Vizzy, was an Indian cricketer, cricket administrator and politician.  Childhood  Vizzy was the second son of Pusapati Vijaya Rama Gajapathi Raju, the ruler of Vizianagaram. His title Maharajkumar (prince) comes for this reason. After his father died in 1922 and his elder brother became the king, Vizzy moved to the family estates in Benares. He married the eldest daughter of the ruler of the zamindari estate of Kashipur.Vizzy's genealogy from Indian Princely States He attended the Princes' College (Mayo College) in Ajmer and Haileybury and Imperial Service College in England. He excelled at tennis and cricket and was also a hunter.  Career  Vizzy organized his cricket team in 1926 and constructed a ground in his palace compounds. He recruited players from India and abroad. When MCC cancelled the tour of India in 1930–31 owing to political problems, he organised a team of his own and toured India and Ceylon. He succeeded in drafting Jack Hobbs and Herbert Sutcliffe for the team, a considerable feat as Hobbs had previously refused offers for five such tours. Vizzy brought Learie Constantine to India a few years later. He brought Mushtaq Ali to Benares for training when he was still a high school student. \\"If Vizzy had been content with being such a cricket sponsor\\", writes Mihir Bose in A History of Indian Cricket,Mihir Bose, A History of Indian Cricket, Andre Deutsch Ltd (1990), p.67, \\"like Sir Horatio Mann in the eighteenth century, or Sir Julien Cahn in the twentieth, his name would be one of the most revered in Indian cricket. But he was consumed with the ambition to be a great cricketer\\". The organisation of the 1930–31 tour gave Vizzy a standing in Indian cricket that was second only to the Maharaja of Patiala.Richard Cashman, Patrons, players and the crowd, Orient Longman (1980), , pp. 42–43 About this time, Patiala fell out with Lord Willingdon, the viceroy of India, and Vizzy got close with the viceroy. He donated a pavilion named after the viceroy in the newly constructed Feroz Shah Kotla ground in Delhi. When the national championship was started in 1934, he attempted to donate a gold 'Willingdon trophy' but Patiala beat him to it with his Ranji Trophy. His wealth and contacts brought him great influence in Indian cricket, even though his cricketing abilities were not great. In the early thirties, he offered to pay the board fifty thousand rupees, forty thousand of it for the Indian tour of England in 1932. He was appointed as the 'deputy vice captain' for the tour but withdrew ostensibly on reasons of health and form.Boria Majumdar, Twenty two yards to freedom, Penguin (2004), , p.43, quotes Vizzy's statement. = Captaincy = Vizzy finally was named the captain of the team that toured England in 1936, a post that he secured after lobbying and manipulation. Unfortunately, his desperately poor captaincy on the field resulted in even the normally reserved British press commenting on it. Some of the senior players in the squad, including Lala Amarnath, C. K. Nayudu and Vijay Merchant, were critical of Vizzy's playing abilities and captaincy, and the team was split between those who supported and those who criticised the captain. The low point in the tour occurred during India's match against Minor Counties at Lord's. Lala Amarnath had been nursing a back injury during the game. Vizzy had Amarnath pad up, but didn't put him in to bat as a succession of other batsmen were sent in ahead of him, which prevented Amarnath from resting his injury. Amarnath was finally put in to bat at the end of the day. Visibly angry after returning to the dressing room, he threw his kit into his bag and muttered in Punjabi, \\"I know what is transpiring\\". Vizzy took this as an affront, and conspired with team manager Major Jack Brittain-Jones to have Lala Amarnath sent back from the tour without playing the First Test.http://www.espncricinfo.com/columns/content/story/303898.html It is also alleged that in the First Test against the England, Vizzy offered Mushtaq Ali a gold watch to run out Vijay Merchant. While India lost the series easily, Vizzy was knighted by King Edward VIII in the King's Birthday Honours. He was the only cricketer to have a knighthood bestowed on him while an active Test cricketer, shortly after his Test debut in June of that year, and prior to his last Test in August of that year.Sir Richard Hadlee's knighthood, though announced on 15 June 1990, was bestowed on him on 4 October 1990, after his final Test match on 10 July 1990. Vizzy renounced his knighthood in July 1947, explaining in a letter to Lord Mountbatten that the knighthood \\"will not be in keeping with the ideals of Republican India\\". MCC awarded him a membership without putting him through the customary waiting list. Vizzy fared poorly in the post-tour enquiry especially in his treatment of Amarnath. In January 1937, the Beaumont Committee report described his captaincy as disastrous. It stated that \\"he did not understand field placings or bowling changes and never maintained any regular batting order.\\" On team selection, the report stated that \\"the good players remained idle for weeks together.\\" The report found Amarnath not guilty of any of the charges alleged by Vizzy and Major Jones, and completely exonerated him. Vizzy never played another cricket match for India again. = Second career = Vizzy maintained a low profile thereafter for almost two decades. He made a comeback as a cricket administrator and was the President of BCCI from 1954–1957. As the vice-president of the BCCI in 1952, he had played a role in bringing back Lala Amarnath as the Indian captain. He successfully promoted Uttar Pradesh's cricketing profile, making Kanpur a centre for Test cricket. On his invitation, C. K. Nayudu, at the age of 61, captained Uttar Pradesh in the 1956–57 season. He worked for the development of cricket in South India and was asked to be President of Mysore cricket association. He was the Vice Chairman of the All India Council of Sports. From the 1948–49 series against West Indies, Vizzy became a radio commentator and was the guest commentator for BBC during the Indian tour of England in 1959. He was not a particularly good commentator. According to Dickie Rutnagur,The Telegraph. Gentlemen & their game. 27 March 2006. when Vizzy had just finished describing how he had hunted tigers, Rohan Kanhai responded: Really? I thought you just left a transistor radio on when you were commentating and bored them to death. He was awarded Padma Bhushan, in 1958http://164.100.47.132/LssNew/biodata_1_12/1409.htm Vizzy was the member of the Lok Sabha from Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh in 1960 and 1962.Members of Parliament from Andhra Pradesh in 1962Results of the by-elections to the Indian states and parliament The Benares University conferred him an honorary Doctor of Laws degree in 1944.Indian Express, 26 January 1958 He died on 2 December 1965, just short of his 60th birthday, in Benares (now Varanasi), considered holy by Hindus.  Notes  *References disagree about Vizzy's place of birth. Wisden, Cricinfo and similar sources put it at Benares. According to some Indian sources,Sources which provide Vizzy's place of birth as Vizianagram include Mihir Bose's A History of Indian Cricket (p. 547 of the 1990 edition) and the almanacs brought out by the Association of Cricket Statisticians and Scorers of India (ACSSI) (p. 461 of the 1990–91 edition, for instance). he was born in Vizianagaram.

It is measured from London Paddington (via Stroud) on the National Rail network. It is the fourth-busiest station in Wales (after Cardiff Central, Cardiff Queen Street and Newport). History The station opened in 1850.History of the Great Western Railway, E.T. MacDermot (rev. C.R. Clinker, pub. Ian Allan, 1964) It was built by the South Wales Railway, which amalgamated with the Great Western Railway (GWR) in 1863, but it was not originally on the South Wales Railway main line, planned to connect London with the port of Fishguard, and Swansea passengers had to change at Landore, two miles to the north until at least 1879. The station has been renovated and extended several times in its lifetime - most notably in the 1880s, when the stone-built office block facing High Street, on the west side of the station, was added, and in 1925-7 when the platforms were lengthened.Track Layout Diagrams of the GWR and BR (Western Region), R.A. Cooke (self-published) The present-day frontage block, facing Ivey Place, was completed in 1934. Nothing now remains of the original wooden station with its two platforms and galvanised iron roof. The majority of the rebuilt station remains intact, although the facilities have been reduced. The umbrella-type platform roofing which replaced the 1880s train- sheds in the 1920s is mostly intact although the canopy on platform 4 has been shortened. The number of platforms was reduced from five to four in 1973 under British Rail when the old Platform 1 was eliminated, along with the loading bays and fish dock that once stood beyond it. The remaining platforms were renumbered at the same time, so that what were platforms 2 to 5 are now platforms 1 to 4, respectively. On the east side of the station there was a connecting line which bypassed the platforms and ran at one time to coal tips on the North Dock (closed in 1929 and subsequently infilled) and on to a junction with the high-level line from Eastern Depot to Victoria station (closed in 1965). Part of the route of this line, alongside the station itself, is now a staff car park and the remainder, which was carried on viaducts alongside the Strand, has been obliterated by modern development. High Street goods station was on the west side of the line, just north of the passenger station. The site has been completely cleared and used for housing and also the dedicated bus road that runs from the Landore park-and-ride facility into the city centre.

Description The station is a terminus, at the end of a short branch off the South Wales Main Line and the West Wales line, so that all through passenger trains must either reverse at Swansea or omit calling there. In practice, almost all passenger services do call there. The station has four platforms. Great Western Railway trains from London normally enter the station with the standard-class carriages leading, and usually use platform 2. The platforms are covered for part of their length. Until January 2004, the mail train to London was a regular service from the station.End of line for mail trains BBC News In February 2013, Swansea station won the \\"Wales’ Best Staffed Train Station\\" award, supported by Keep Wales Tidy.http://www.keepwalestidy.org/10408 In May 2013, Swansea station was named \\"International Station of the Year\\" and won the \\"Best Large Station\\" award at the International Station Awards.http://www.thisissouthwales.co.uk/Swansea- Station-named-UK-s-best- following-7/story-18879502-detail/story.html#axzz2TjpwhM2z The ticket office is open here each day (Monday - Friday 05:15 - 20:00, Saturday 06:15 - 20:00, Sunday 08:00 - 20:00), with self-service ticket machines provided for use when the ticket office is closed and for collecting pre-paid tickets.

Work was completed in June 2012 and officially opened by the Welsh Government Minister with responsibility for Transport, Carl Sargeant, on Monday 11 June.http://wales.gov.uk/newsroom/transport/2012/120611swanseatrainstation/?lang=en Further redevelopment work was carried out in the form of a new Ticket Office, completed in September 2017. A new enclosure was constructed for the ticket office, separating it from the main station concourse. In October 2020, Network Rail and Transport for Wales announced that work will start on rebuilding and lengthening Platform 4. This will allow longer trains to use the platform and provide extra flexibility. At the same time, Transport for Wales will undertake other improvement works at the station including re- branding, improved ticket buying facilities and refurbished spaces for use by local businesses and community groups. The work is due to be finished by summer 2021.https://news.tfwrail.wales/news/transport-for-wales-and-network- rail-to-deliver-improvements-at-swansea-station  Routes  See also *Transport in Wales *List of railway stations in Wales References Railways around Swansea factsheet from Swansea Museums Service *The South Wales Railway factsheet from Swansea Museums Service Further reading * External links *Station on navigable O.

Early life Bill Nunn III was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the son of Frances Nunn and William G. Nunn, Jr., a journalist and editor at the Pittsburgh Courier and a National Football League scout. His paternal grandfather was the first African American football player at George Westinghouse High School. While ball boys for the Pittsburgh Steelers, Bill Nunn and current Steelers President Art Rooney II stole \\"Mean\\" Joe Greene's car during training camp at Saint Vincent College in Latrobe, Pennsylvania. \\"Joe Greene showed up in a beautiful green Lincoln Continental, and me and Bill Nunn, Jr. were ball boys.

He attended college with Spike Lee and appeared in several of Lee's early feature films. Career Nunn made his credited film debut in the 1988 Spike Lee film School Daze, and is best known for his roles as Radio Raheem in Lee's Do the Right Thing, and as Nino Brown's bodyguard Duh Duh Duh Man in New Jack City. Some of his other film credits include Lee's Mo' Better Blues and He Got Game, as well as Regarding Henry, Sister Act, Canadian Bacon, The Last Seduction, Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead, Runaway Jury, Spider-Man trilogy (as Joseph \\"Robbie\\" Robertson), Firehouse Dog, the television series The Job, Randy and The Mob, and the 2016 televised adaptation of A Raisin in the Sun. Nunn also performed on stage, including August Wilson's Fences, a Pittsburgh-based play; Nunn performed alongside Anthony Mackie, who played Nunn's character's son. Nunn was also very involved in community outreach, and he formed his own Pittsburgh-area outreach project in 2008.  Death  Nunn died on September 24, 2016 in his home in Pittsburgh's Hill District; he was 62 years old. His widow, Donna, confirmed that he had leukemia.

It is single-seated and has one steerable front wheel and two fixed rear wheels. The driver sits in the seat located in the middle of the vehicle and accelerates and slows down by applying steering manoeuvres in coordination with flying manoeuvres of the kite. This activity is called kite buggying. The speed achieved in kite buggies by skilled drivers can range up to around 110 km/h (70 mph), hence protective clothing, including a safety helmet, is commonly worn. The kite buggy was probably invented in China around the 13th century. It was promulgated by George Pocock (inventor) in the UK in 1827The Aeropleustic Art or Navigation in the Air by the use of Kites, or Buoyant Sails. London, 1827. (March 2001 Book of the Month, University of Glasgow Special Collections) and kite buggies were available commercially in US and UK in the late 1970s.Amphi-Kiting (Archived from original) Peter Lynn is generally attributed with the modern popularization of buggies and kite buggying with his introduction of strong, lightweight, affordable buggies in the early 1990s. Kite buggying is similar to land yachting, windsurfing or even yachting, and therefore much of its terminology and technique has been adopted from these activities. Kite buggies are classified as \\"Class 8 Land Yachts \\" by FISLY and kite buggying competitions are often based on established land yachting guidelines.  Details, Steering, Seat  Kite buggying, Claggan, Erris, Co. Mayo The kite buggy's rear wheels are mounted at the ends of the rear axle. The front wheel is mounted in the front fork. In advanced buggy designs either or both front and rear wheels can be attached via suspension mechanisms. The front fork is not unlike a bicycle's fork apart from proportions and the fact that there is no handle bar at the top. Instead there are two foot rests sticking out, on the left and right of it, attached to the fork very low down, near where the wheel is mounted. These foot rests have two main purposes: :* they allow the pilot to easily steer the buggy. Pushing the left foot forward will turn the front wheel to the right, pushing the right foot forward will turn the front wheel to the left. :* they allow the pilot to lodge himself tightly into the seat so he is not pulled out of the buggy by the kite. Foot rests can be fitted with foot straps and grip tape to prevent the feet from sliding off the rests during extreme buggying action. Foot straps are not recommended for beginners, due to the possibility that they will not be able to remove their feet from the pegs if the buggy flips over and therefore risk breaking their ankles. The seat of the buggy is a bucket style seat giving the pilot good side and back support. This is necessary as the driver has to transfer the force of the used traction kite into the buggy.  Power and Braking  The buggy is powered by a traction kite, controlled by the pilot. The traction kite is normally not directly attached to the buggy. Instead it is--through its lines and handles--either held by the pilot or attached to the pilot by a harness and strop line. The kite is used to accelerate the buggy and also assists in braking. The buggy itself does not have any dedicated braking system that would apply a braking force directly to the wheels.  Frame, Wheels and Weight  The geometry and measurements of a buggy's frame determine what kind of buggying activities it is best suited for. Longer buggies are generally more stable on a straight line whereas shorter buggies tend to be more nimble when cornering. A wider rear axle will make the buggy more resistant against accidentally toppling over. However, intentional trick riding, e.g. on only two wheels (the front and one of the rear wheels), is more difficult. Rear axles will generally be in the range of about 1.0 to 1.5 metres. Shorter or longer measures are possible for more extreme applications. Possible styles of wheels vary from very thin (like a speed-sail's wheels) over standard size (like a wheelbarrow's) to very large, also known as \\"big foot\\". Wheels are not constructed with exposed bare spokes (like bicycle wheels are) because this would put the buggy driver's hands and kite handles at risk of getting caught in the wheel. The different types of wheels are used in different terrain conditions and buggying activities. A few examples include: :* thin rim wheel: best used on very firm ground; activities: race and speed buggying :* standard size wheel: best used on very to moderately firm sand, not too bumpy fields; activities: general buggying, trick buggying :* big foot: best used on beaches of any kind, fields, even if uneven and bumpy; activities: general buggying, trick buggying, racing The buggy's (and pilot's) mass has a considerable impact on its handling. A very light buggy is more agile and quicker to manoeuvre. A heavier buggy does not slide sideways as easily, enabling it to transfer higher lateral kite forces into the ground via friction. This allows the use of higher powered kites which can propel the buggy to higher speeds. To increase the usable kite force, a buggy can be equipped with additional weights. These weights will be attached to the buggy as low down as possible to keep the overall centre of gravity low. Also possible is filling some of the buggy frame's usually hollow tubes with a dense substance such as lead.  Tandem Configurations  Some buggies allow for attaching a second buggy using a specialized kind of trailer coupling. Buggies joined up like this can be powered by a single kite controlled by the pilot in the first buggy. This allows the passenger in the second buggy to be simply pulled along passively. Alternatively, a tandem kite configuration can be flown where both front and rear buggy pilots steer a separate and independent kite each. This requires very skilled pilots and good communication between them.  Extensions, Custom Designs  In addition to the traditional 3-wheeled buggy there are designs applying 4 wheels--with a more complex steering mechanism. Even 2-wheeled buggies exist--with only one single wheel at the back instead of the common 2-wheel rear axle. Some buggies can be equipped with ice skating blades replacing the wheels for use on ice or cut-down skis for use on snow.  Buggy Jumping Buggy jump One of the more extreme manifestations of the sport is buggy jumping. This involves the pilot being physically attached--which is not the case for the other, more moderate kite buggying activities--to the buggy by means of a lap belt and the use of relatively large kites. The pilot flies the kite overhead to generate maximum lift and is then--with the buggy-- hoisted up to tens of feet into the air. Very advanced pilots even perform aerial manoeuvres such as 360° (or more) spins, sidewinders, pendulum swings and reverse landings.  Safety  Kite buggying and other traction kite activities can be classified as extreme sports. Wind is the only power source and is often very unpredictable. An attitude of caution and respect towards the wind is essential, for the novice just as well as the advanced pilot. Common advice is to start with a relatively small kite in relatively low wind conditions (e.g. 2 to 3 m² kites in winds of force 2 to 3 bft) and progress to bigger kites or higher wind conditions as ability improves. Novices should first achieve and practice full control over their kite before considering the next step, the actual kite buggying. Performing the sport, the kite buggy pilot has to always act responsibly and make sure to not harm bystanders or cause damage to the environment or property. Choosing a kiting location with enough space is crucial for this. All possible safety precautions should be taken: protective clothing and an adequate helmet are a must. Helmets to be considered are downhill mountain bike helmets with chin guard (light, well ventilated, good field of vision) or paragliding helmets (light, relatively well ventilated, good field of vision). True motorbike helmets are often considered less suitable as they are relatively heavy and the field of vision can be impaired (when kite buggying, both the kite itself and the terrain around the buggy should be easily visible). A frequent cause of accidents is flying a kite too large for the wind conditions and experience of the pilot. In such a case buggy and pilot tend to be pulled downwind, often skidding and sliding sideways with a high risk of the pilot entirely losing control of kite and buggy. This can be avoided by flying kites small enough so that they allow the pilot to safely stop the buggy by turning it through the wind and driving upwind. Pilots are encouraged to obtain 3rd party liability insurance as there is a risk of coming into contact with bystanders or each other. Such insurance is available through the various national and regional organisations like the South and West Association of Traction Kiting (SWATK) or the British Power Kitesports Association (BPKA). Responsible shops should strongly discourage newcomers from buying very powerful kites without instruction. They should also offer or help organising tuition for novice pilots, ideally through PKSF- accredited instructors. As with all kite-flying activities, the kiting code of conduct applies.

He is regarded as the author of \\"The Five Tropes (or Modes, in ) of Agrippa\\", which are purported to establish the necessity of suspending judgment (epoché). Agrippa's arguments form the basis of the Agrippan trilemma. The five modes of Agrippa Sextus Empiricus described these \\"modes\\" or \\"tropes\\" in Outlines of Pyrrhonism, attributing them \\"to the more recent skeptics\\"; Diogenes Laërtius attributes them to Agrippa.Diogenes Laërtius, ix. The five modes of Agrippa (also known as the five tropes of Agrippa) are: # Dissent – The uncertainty demonstrated by the differences of opinions among philosophers and people in general. # Progress ad infinitum – All proof rests on matters themselves in need of proof, and so on to infinity, i.e, the regress argument. # Relation – All things are changed as their relations become changed, or, as we look upon them from different points of view. # Assumption – The truth asserted is based on an unsupported assumption. # Circularity – The truth asserted involves a circularity of proofs. > According to the mode deriving from dispute, we find that undecidable > dissension about the matter proposed has come about both in ordinary life > and among philosophers. Because of this we are not able to choose or to rule > out anything, and we end up with suspension of judgement. In the mode > deriving from infinite regress, we say that what is brought forward as a > source of conviction for the matter proposed itself needs another such > source, which itself needs another, and so ad infinitum, so that we have no > point from which to begin to establish anything, and suspension of judgement > follows. In the mode deriving from relativity, as we said above, the > existing object appears to be such-and-such relative to the subject judging > and to the things observed together with it, but we suspend judgement on > what it is like in its nature. We have the mode from hypothesis when the > Dogmatists, being thrown back ad infinitum, begin from something which they > do not establish but claim to assume simply and without proof in virtue of a > concession. The reciprocal mode occurs when what ought to be confirmatory of > the object under investigation needs to be made convincing by the object > under investigation; then, being unable to take either in order to establish > the other, we suspend judgement about both.Sextus Empiricus, Pyrrhōneioi > hypotypōseis i., from Annas, J., Outlines of Scepticism Cambridge University > Press. (2000). The first and third tropes summarize the earlier Ten Modes of Aenesidemus. The three additional ones show a progress in the Pyrrhonist system, building upon the objections derived from the fallibility of sense and opinion to more abstract and metaphysical grounds. According to Victor Brochard \\"the five tropes can be regarded as the most radical and most precise formulation of philosophical skepticism that has ever been given. In a sense, they are still irresistible today.\\"Brochard, V., The Greek Skeptics.

He was the 1989 Heisman Trophy winner as a quarterback for the University of Houston. He was the first African American quarterback to receive this honor. In the 1990 NFL Draft, Ware was the first round selection (#7 overall) of the Detroit Lions. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2004. College career Ware grew up in the Galveston, Texas region, hoping to play football at the University of Texas. He said \\"I was going to Texas. All they had to do was lie to me and tell me I was going to play quarterback once I got there. Thank goodness they told me the truth [that] they were going to move me to defense\\". After graduating from Dickinson High School, Ware instead played at the University of Houston, where he won the Heisman Trophy in 1989, along with the Davey O'Brien Award, the latter award given to the most outstanding college quarterback of the year. That year, his junior year, he threw for 4,699 yards, 44 touchdowns, and set 26 NCAA records. Many of the records were thanks to the innovative use of the run and shoot offense, which his successor, David Klingler, also used to great effect. The Cougars ended the season ranked the #14 team in the nation by the Associated Press. He then declared for the NFL Draft, foregoing his senior year. Professional football career Ware was made the #1 draft pick of the Detroit Lions when head coach Wayne Fontes overrode the advice of the team's scouting director, who resigned the next day. Ware joined the Lions for the 1990 season, teaming with the previous Heisman Trophy winner from 1988, Barry Sanders. Ware spent four years with Detroit, playing 14 games and starting six: Wayne Fontes insisted on starting the oft-injured Rodney Peete, and usually replacing Peete with Erik Kramer when Peete was hurt or played poorly. Fontes generally only played Ware when the Lions were out of the playoffs or already losing a game by a wide margin. Ware's best stretch came late in the 1992 season when the Lions were out of the playoffs: he won two of three games. He began 1994 on the roster of the Los Angeles Raiders, but was released after several games. In 1995, he was signed by the Jacksonville Jaguars, one of the NFL's two expansion teams that year. As a former Heisman Trophy winner, Ware's presence gathered much local excitement in Jacksonville, but ultimately, Ware was cut from the team the week before the regular season began. It is debated why Ware failed in the NFL despite a prolific college career.

Pain that involves both breasts and which occurs repeatedly before the menstrual period is generally not serious. Pain that involves only one part of a breast is more concerning. It is particularly concerning if a hard mass or nipple discharge is also present. Causes may be related to the menstrual cycle, birth control pills, hormone therapy, or psychiatric medication. Pain may also occur in those with large breasts, during menopause, and in early pregnancy. In about 2% of cases breast pain is related to breast cancer. Diagnosis involves examination, with medical imaging if only a specific part of the breast hurts. In more than 75% of people the pain resolves without any specific treatment. Otherwise treatments may include paracetamol or NSAIDs. A well fitting bra may also help. In those with severe pain tamoxifen or danazol may be used. About 70% of women have breast pain at some point in time. Breast pain is one of the most common breast symptoms, along with breast masses and nipple discharge. Causes Cyclical breast pain is often associated with fibrocystic breast changes or duct ectasia and thought to be caused by changes of prolactin response to thyrotropin. Some degree of cyclical breast tenderness is normal in the menstrual cycle, and is usually associated with menstruation and/or premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Noncyclical breast pain has various causes and is harder to diagnose and frequently the root cause is outside the breast. Some degree of non-cyclical breast tenderness can normally be present due to hormonal changes in puberty (both in girls and boys), in menopause and during pregnancy. After pregnancy, breast pain can be caused by breastfeeding. Other causes of non-cyclical breast pain include alcoholism with liver damage (likely due to abnormal steroid metabolism), mastitis and medications such as digitalis, methyldopa (an antihypertensive), spironolactone, certain diuretics, oxymetholone (an anabolic steroid), and chlorpromazine (a typical antipsychotic). Also, shingles can cause a painful blistering rash on the skin of the breasts. =Breast cancer= Some women who have pain in one or both breasts may fear breast cancer. However, breast pain is not a common symptom of cancer. The great majority of breast cancer cases do not present with symptoms of pain, though breast pain in older women is more likely to be associated with cancer., [Electronic book] Section I Guidelines, Chapter Thirteen: Gynecologic Guidelines-Breast Pain Diagnosis Diagnosis involves breast examination, with medical imaging if only a specific part of the breast hurts. Medical imaging by ultrasound is recommended for all ages, well in those over 30 it is recommended together with mammography. Ruling out the other possible causes of the pain is one way to differentiate the source of the pain. Breast pain can be due to: *angina pectoris *anxiety and depression *bra *blocked milk duct *breastfeeding *chest wall muscle pain *consensual, rough sex *costal chondritis (sore ribs) *cutaneous candida infection *duct ectasia (often with nipple discharge) *engorgement *fibroadenoma *fibrocystic breast changes *fibromyalgia *gastroesophageal reflux disease *herpes infection *hormone replacement therapy *mastitis or breast infection *menopause *menstruation and Premenstrual syndrome *perimenopause *neuralgia *pregnancy *physical abuse *pituitary tumor (often with nipple discharge) *puberty in both girls and boys *sexual abuse *shingles *sore nipples and cracked nipples *surgery or biopsy *trauma (including falls) Medications can be associated with breast pain and include: * Oxymetholone *Chlorpromazine *Water pills (diuretics) *Digitalis preparations *Methyldopa *Spironolactone Diagnostic testing can be useful. Typical tests used are mammogram, excisional biopsy for solid lumps, fine-needle aspiration and biopsy, pregnancy test, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Treatment In more than 75% of people the pain resolves without any specific treatment. Otherwise treatments may include paracetamol or NSAIDs. A well fitting bra may also help. In those with severe pain tamoxifen or danazol may be used. Bromocriptine may be used as well. Spironolactone, low dose oral contraceptives, and low-dose estrogen have helped to relieve pain. Topical anti-inflammatory medications can be used for localized pain. Vitamin E is not effective in relieving pain nor is evening primrose oil. Vitamin B6 and vitamin A have not been consistently found to be beneficial. Flaxseed has shown some activity in the treatment of cyclic mastalgia. Pain may be relieved by the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or, for more severe localized pain, by local anaesthetic. Pain may be relieved by reassurance that it does not signal a serious underlying problem, and an active life style can also effect an improvement. Information regarding how the pain is real but not necessarily caused by disease can help to understand the problem. Counseling can also be to describe changes that vary during the monthly cycle. Women on hormone replacement therapy may benefit from a dose adjustment. Another non- pharmacological measure to help relieve symptoms of pain may be to use good bra support. Breasts change during adolescence and menopause and refitting may be beneficial. Applying heat and/or ice can bring relief. Dietary changes may also help with the pain. Methylxanthines can be eliminated from the diet to see if a sensitivity is present. Some clinicians recommending a reduction in salt, though no evidence supports this practice.

CEO and Co-founder is Naveen Jain and Niraj Shah is a Co-founder and CTO, Ed Petersen is a Co-founder and Executive Vice President. Zabasearch claims it overtook Yahoo! People Search as the highest trafficked people search engine by May 2005. Description Irene Davids, in an article posted at KillerStartups.com, describes Zabasearch thusly: :Do you have a cousin that you haven’t seen for years and would like to know where to reach him? Maybe you would like to start stalking your favorite celebrity? Then go to Zabasearch, considered google on steroids, this site provides you with a free and easy to use search bar, where you can type anybody’s name, that is, anybody that lives in the United States, and their address and phone numbers will appear. A recent search for a certain Hollywood and indie film star who shall remain nameless (let’s avoid stalkers, ok?) fielded results showing she owned a house in the Hollywood Hills and an apartment in Greenwich Village in NYC. As SFGates David Lazarus further discussed in 2005, regarding the site's free and paid services: :ZabaSearch buys and gives away basic personal data as a loss leader to induce visitors to purchase more comprehensive background checks for $20 each. :The company charges $100 for even more in-depth searches, with a money- back guarantee if the person sought doesn't turn up. :It also carries a paid link to Experian, the credit-reporting agency, to obtain a free credit report. (This will automatically sign you up as well for Experian's credit-monitoring program, which will cost $9.95 a month unless you opt out after a 30-day trial period.)'' The company asserts that all of the information accessible on the site was already extant on the Internet on many government or corporate databases, the likes of which could (usually) already be accessed piecemeal by the general public. As such, they assert that the site fosters nothing new except the convenience of gathering the data automatically and is not suited for use by potential identity thieves. The website, which may be searched online as well as accessed on the Google Toolbar, allows consumers who register there the option to be notified by email when they, or people they know, are being searched and advised who is searching their name or social security number. Reception Irene Davids' aforementioned review at KillerStartups.com hinted at the site's usefulness for stalking but skewed favorable, while Reviewopedia's balanced review of Zabasearch, metatitled \\"Zabasearch - Legit or Scam?\\", even-handedly enumerates the sites pros and cons. As of April 5, 2014, the two articles posted in the \\"Related Articles\\" section, positioned immediately below the Zabasearch review, are both cautionary, \\"People Search Websites and What You Should Know\\" and \\"Protect Yourself from Online Identity Theft\\". Email messages containing personal information that were previously not searchable by Google, Internet Explorer or FireFox became searchable sometime before June 2014, which many people may consider to be a violation of privacy. Zabasearch previously claimed to only share names and email addresses of users and information already published elsewhere, and not the text of personal messages. However, numerous complaints about Zabasearch have been posted with various agencies - such as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regarding Internet privacy, the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse (PRC), and the California Office of Privacy Protection (COPP) \\\\- as well as online, at such sites as ConsumerAffairs.com and RipoffReport. KnowPrivacy observes: :Users Only Complain When They Perceive an Invasion of Privacy and Know Where to File a Complaint :An analysis of the complaints about ZabaSearch revealed two distinctive spikes in the numbers of complaints during the five-year period (see chart), one in mid 2005 and another in mid 2006. :A conversation with the president and co- founder of ZabaSearch, Robert Zakari, revealed that the first spike coincided with a critical article in the San Francisco Chronicle, by David Lazarus. The Privacy Rights Clearinghouse quickly picked up the story and discussed the company in its May 2005 newsletter. A follow-up article in August by the same author explicitly mentioned the PRC, whose website directed users to complain to the FTC. :Zakari also pointed out that the 2006 spike coincided with ZabaSearch removing their opt-out policy from the website. The PRC's monthly newsletter again featured ZabaSearch and specifically directed readers to complain to the FTC. :We believe these spikes illustrate that when a specific instance of the public display of a consumer's personal information is made known to them, and they are provided with specific instructions regarding to whom to complain, consumers are concerned and will voice those concerns to advocacy organizations and regulators.

It was formed in 1978, as an umbrella coalition of parties supporting then-President Ferdinand E. Marcos for the Interim Batasang Pambansa (National Assembly), and was his political vehicle during his rule. It was reorganized as a political party in 1986. Since 1986, the KBL has contested in most of the national and local elections in the Philippines but retained a single seat in the House of Representatives in Ilocos Norte, which was held by former First Lady Imelda Marcos until 2019. Party division There was confusion in the 2007 election campaign within the party which stems from the recent endorsement (allegedly by the KBL) of Marcos loyalist lawyer Oliver Lozano to dubious senatorial candidate Joselito Pepito \\"Peter\\" Cayetano, who was the namesake of Rep. Alan Peter Cayetano, an opposition stalwart. Rep. Cayetano said that Gov. Ferdinand \\"Bongbong\\" Marcos Jr., who is the president of the KBL, has certified that Joselito Cayetano has no party affiliation whatsoever with the KBL and that no endorsement was called for his namesake's candidacy. Subsequently, Marcos has denounced loyalist lawyer and senatorial candidate Oliver Lozano along with his candidates for turning the KBL into an \\"embarrassment\\". Marcos said that the party leadership would deal with the \\"renegade members\\" of the KBL after the elections. On November 20, 2009, the KBL forged an alliance with the Nacionalista Party (NP) between Bongbong Marcos and NP Chairman Senator Manny Villar at the Laurel House in Mandaluyong. Bongbong was later on removed as a member by the KBL National Executive Committee on November 23. As such, the NP broke its alliance with the KBL due to internal conflicts within the party, though Bongbong remained part of the NP Senatorial line-up.

History = Background and early history, 1983–1988 = The party now known as PDP–Laban is the result of a merger between the Partido Demokratiko Pilipino and Lakas ng Bayan. Former Olongapo City mayor Teodoro “Teddy” Macapagal, Rodrigo Duterte and Nene Pimentel founded PDP-Laban. Partido Demokratiko Pilipino (PDP) was founded on February 6, 1982 in Cebu City by Aquilino \\"Nene\\" Pimentel Jr. and a group of protesters against the authoritarian government of Ferdinand Marcos, the 10th President of the Philippines, and the then-ruling Kilusang Bagong Lipunan (KBL). These protesters included the leaders of Davao City and Cagayan de Oro City, such as Zafiro L. Respicio, Rey Magno Teves, Cesar R. Ledesma, Samuel Occeña, Crispin Lanorias and Mords Cua. Merger and participation in the 1986 snap election By 1983, PDP had formed a coalition with Lakas ng Bayan (Tagalog for \\"People's Power\\"), the party founded by former Senator Benigno Aquino, Jr. in 1978. In 1986, the two groups merged to form the Partido Demokratiko Pilipino–Lakas ng Bayan or PDP–Laban. During that period, PDP–Laban became the single biggest opposition group to run against the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos in the 1986 snap presidential election. Corazon Aquino, the widow of the assassinated senator Benigno Aquino Jr., became the party's nominee to run for President. Aquino was persuaded to run by businessman, newspaperman and street parliamentarian Joaquin Roces, who was convinced that Aquino would have the biggest chance to defeat Marcos in the polls. Roces started the \\"Cory Aquino for President\\" movement to gather one million voters in one week to urge Aquino to run for president. However, another opposition group led by Senator Salvador Laurel of Batangas was also participating in the election, with Laurel being its presidential bet. Before the election, Aquino approached Laurel and offered to give up her allegiance to the PDP–Laban party and run as president under Laurel's United Nationalist Democratic Organization (UNIDO) party. Laurel later approached Aquino, offering her only the vice-vresidential nomination of UNIDO (or Unity). In the end, Laurel became the vice- presidential running-mate of Aquino, after being convinced to do so by the Archbishop of Manila, Jaime Cardinal Sin. PDP–Laban then aligned itself with UNIDO, which became the main group and leader of the coalition which opposed Marcos. After the People Power Revolution of 1986, which saw Aquino and Laurel proclaimed President and Vice President respectively, PDP–Laban continued its alliance with UNIDO until the latter's dissolution in 1987. In 1988, PDP–Laban was split into two factions: the Pimentel Wing led by Aquilino Pimentel, Jr. and the Cojuangco Wing led by Jose Cojuangco, Jr.. The Cojuangco Wing and the Lakas ng Bayan party of House Speaker Ramon Mitra, Jr. merged in 1988 to form the Laban ng Demokratikong Pilipino party. =Presidency of Rodrigo Duterte and majority in Congress, 2016–present= PDP–Laban is headed by its president, senator Aquilino \\"Koko\\" Pimentel III, after the then incumbent Vice-President of the Philippines, Jejomar Binay, resigned as party chairman and left the party. Binay later created United Nationalist Alliance or UNA. The party is currently re-grouping, and there are some movements of expansion especially in Mindanao, where it originated, particularly in the Davao region. Two of the party's founders, Crispin Lanorias and Cesar Ledesma, are again active in recent party activities. After the 2016 elections, PDP–Laban signed a coalition agreement with the Nacionalista Party, Lakas–CMD, National Unity Party and the Nationalist People's Coalition, witnessed by then President- elect Rodrigo Duterte. Immediately after the May 2016 elections, several representatives from other parties moved to PDP–Laban, notably: Geraldine Roman (Bataan), Alfred Vargas (Quezon City), and Ansaruddin Adiong (Lanao del Sur). The party's presence in the House of Representatives eventually grew from three members in the 16th Congress, to 123 members in the current 17th Congress. By April 2018, 300,000 politicians had joined the party, according to Koko Pimentel. Campaign logo until 2016 Former logo until 2016, which contains an illustration of Lapu-Lapu. The current logo later included a modernized version of the illustration on top of the \\"Duterte fist\\". Reacting to the influx of new members, party founder Nene Pimentel urged members to question the motivations of new incoming politicians and ensure they are interested in the party's ideals. He stated that these new members might only be interested in identifying with the current administration, in order to boost their chances of winning in the upcoming 2019 elections. PDP–Laban plans to learn from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). It is set to send some of its members to the CCP's school in Fujian for \\"policy training\\" to learn more on how the party is organized. The Filipino party also established ties with United Russia, Russia's ruling party, in October 2017. PDP–Laban has also expressed interest in sending a delegation to the Workers' Party of Korea, which is the ruling party of North Korea. A four-member delegation is set to meet with the North Korean party in July 2018.  Leadership crisis  On July 23, 2018, the same day as Duterte's third State of the Nation Address, an internal leadership dispute within the House of Representatives' majority resulted in former president and current Pampanga representative Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo becoming Speaker of the lower house, replacing Pantaleon Alvarez. The resolution was adopted that same night with 184 voting in favor and 12 abstaining. Arroyo was previously a member of Lakas–CMD, before switching to PDP–Laban in 2017. Some representatives, including Deputy Speaker Rolando Andaya (Camarines Sur), are eyeing to shift towards other political parties after Arroyo's ascendance to the House's leadership. Andaya also said that some lawmakers might join Lakas–CMD, Arroyo's former party, and merge with Sara Duterte-Carpio's Hugpong ng Pagbabago (HNP). Duterte-Carpio denied rumors that members of PDP–Laban were seeking to move into HNP, which is a regional party based in Davao Region. Succeeding these events, a faction sought to unseat PDP–Laban's high-ranking officials. Willy Talag, president of the party's Makati City council and chair of the membership committee of the NCR Chapter, said during an assembly of the party on July 27 that PDP–Laban's current leaders have committed violations, including holding mass oath taking of members “without proper basic seminar” and swearing in officials that are “involved in illegal drugs.\\" The faction elected Rogelio Garcia and Talag as party president and chairman, respectively, removing Senator Aquilino \\"Koko\\" Pimentel III and Rep. Pantaleon Alvarez from their respective positions. Koko Pimentel dismissed the election of new leaders, disowning the group and assembly, and called the event an \\"unofficial, unauthorized, rogue assembly using the name of PDP-Laban\\". Sen. Pimentel, who has personally dismissed the election, together with PDP–Laban vice chairman and Department of Energy Sec. Alfonso Cusi, and Rep. Alvarez have notified members that the supposed national assembly was not officially sanctioned by the party. Special Assistant to the President Bong Go said in an interview with CNN Philippines that Duterte is set to meet the two factions, in an effort to unite the party. Events prior to the 2019 general election Months later, on November 30, the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) released a statement recognizing Pimentel's group as the legitimate leadership of PDP–Laban. Following this, Pimentel has said that his faction will not recognize candidates from the Garcia wing. In a move branded as an 'ideology flip-flop', the party endorsed Imee Marcos as one of its senatorial candidates. Marcos, who has been implicated on numerous graft and corruption cases, is the daughter of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, whose authoritarian regime sparked the establishment of PDP–Laban and the party's democratic revolution against the Marcos dictatorship. Ideology and platform According to self-published material, PDP-LABAN seeks a peaceful and democratic way of life characterized by \\"freedom, solidarity, justice, equity, social responsibility, self- reliance, efficiency and enlightened nationalism\\". It has touted as its five guiding principles the following: theism, authentic humanism, enlightened nationalism, democratic socialism, and consultative and participatory democracy. The party advocates a transition to a federal, semi-presidential parliamentary form of government from the current unitary presidential system through a revision of the present 1987 Constitution of the Philippines.  Symbols  From the 1980s, the 'Laban' or 'L' sign was a hand gesture used by the party, along with other members of the UNIDO coalition, which originally supported Corazon Aquino. This was done by raising the thumb and index finger over the forehead, forming a letter \\"L' shape. This was popularized during the People Power Revolution. During the campaign and presidency of Rodrigo Duterte, the Laban sign fell into disuse within PDP-Laban and was replaced with the \\"Duterte fist\\", which was the hand symbol popularized by Rodrigo Duterte. The \\"Duterte fist\\" was later included in the party's current logo.

Founded in 1891 and nicknamed \\"the Robins\\", they are currently members of and play at Moss Lane. History Altrincham was established by a Sunday school around 1891 as Rigby Memorial Club.Altrincham F.C., a Brief History Altrincham F.C. They soon merged with another local team, Grapplers, to form Broadheath Football Club, and were founder members of the Manchester League in 1893. Their first match in the league on 16 September 1893 saw them lose 7–0 to Hulme, and they went on to lose 14 of the remaining league matches as they finished bottom of the table.A to Z of Altrincham Football Club Altrincham F.C. After playing at various grounds in Broadheath, Timperley and Altrincham, the club moved to Pollitt's Field in 1903, at which point they changed their name to Altrincham. They won the Cheshire Amateur Cup in their first season under the new name, and went on to win both the Manchester League and the Cheshire Senior Cup the following season. They won the Manchester League again in 1906–07, and moved to their current Moss Lane ground in 1910. In 1911 the club joined Division Two of the Lancashire Combination. They finished as runners-up in their first season in the division, only missing out on the title on goal average and earning promotion to Division One. They remained in Division One until World War I. When football resumed in 1919, the club were founder members of the Cheshire County League, where they remained until World War II, the highlights being finishing as runners-up in 1934–35 and 1935–36 and a League Cup win in 1932–33. In 1934–35 they reached the first round of the FA Cup for the first time, losing 1–0 at Gainsborough Trinity. After missing out the 1945–46 season, they rejoined the Cheshire County League in 1946, achieving little success until the 1960s, when Altrincham director Noel White hired Freddie Pye as manager. A key turning point in the history of the club is often cited as the signing of Jackie Swindells in 1965, who in his first full season (1965–66) scored 82 goals.Altrincham Football Club Legends Section Eighteen Profiles 52–54 Altrincham F.C. helping Altrincham to the first of back-to-back Cheshire County League titles, scoring over 120 goals in the league in both seasons. After finishing as runners-up in 1967–68, they were founder members of the Northern Premier League in 1968. They reached the semi-finals of the FA Trophy in 1976–77, losing 2–1 to Scarborough in a second replay; the season also saw them apply for election to the Football League for the first time, but they received only 12 votes compared to the 27 received by the elected Wimbledon. The following season they went one better in the FA Trophy, reaching the Wembley final, where they beat Leatherhead 3–1. In 1978–79 they finished as runners-up in the Northern Premier League and applied for election to the Football League again. Although they finished as the top non-League club in the ballot, they received only 13 votes to the 37 received by Halifax Town, the lowest-placed Football League club.A history of admission to the Football League Non-League Matters Instead, Altrincham became founder members of the Alliance Premier League, the top level of non-League football, the winner of which would be the sole non-League nomination for future Football League election ballots. The league's inaugural season saw Altrincham crowned champions. In the subsequent elections to the Football League, the club missing out by a single vote, receiving 25 to Rochdale's 26; this was considered especially unfortunate as the club had been promised the votes of Grimsby Town and Luton Town, but the Grimsby representative was prevented from voting by being in the wrong part of the meeting room, whilst the Luton representative arrived too late after a mix-up over the start time.Dave Twydell (2001) Denied F.C.: The Football League election struggles, Yore Publications, p27 Altrincham retained the APL title the following season, but again failed in the Football League elections, this time only receiving 15 votes to the 41 received by Halifax, who were again the lowest ranked Football League club. The next two seasons saw the club finish in mid-table, together with another FA Trophy final appearance in 1981–82, this time losing 1–0 to Enfield. This was followed by four consecutive top-five finishes between 1984 and 1987 and a second FA Trophy win in 1985, beating Runcorn 1–0 in the final. The 1985–86 season saw them record one of the biggest FA Cup giant-killings of all time when they defeated top division Birmingham City 2–1 at Birmingham's St Andrew's. The club then returned to mid-table with occasional successful seasons, finishing third in 1990–91 (by which time the league had become the Football Conference) and fourth in 1994–95. After finishing bottom of the Conference in 1996–97 the club were relegated to the Premier Division of the Northern Premier League. An eighth-place finish in 1997–98 saw them return to the Conference two seasons later as Premier Division champions. However, they lasted only a single season in the Conference as they finished second-from- bottom and were relegated back to the Northern Premier League. A twelfth-place finish in 2003–04 saw them qualify for the newly formed Conference North. They finished fifth in the new division in its first season, qualifying for the promotion play-offs. After defeating Nuneaton Borough 4–2 on penalties following a 1–1 draw and then Kettering Town 3–2, they were promoted to the Conference National division with a 2–1 win over Eastbourne Borough in the North/South final played at the Britannia Stadium. In 2005–06 Altrincham finished bottom of the Conference National after receiving an 18-point deduction when they were found to have fielded an ineligible player, James Robinson, for 15 matches, during which he scored six goals and Altrincham won 18 points. However, they were reprieved from relegation after Canvey Island resigned from the league and Scarborough were demoted. The following season they again finished in the relegation zone, but were reprieved after Boston United were demoted. A third successive relegation reprieve occurred in 2007–08 when Halifax were liquidated. After mid-table finishes in 2008–09 and 2009–10 and Ricky Ponting becoming a shareholder of the club in 2009, Altrincham were relegated to the Conference North at the end of the 2010–11 season. In 2012–13 a fourth-place finish saw them qualify for the promotion play-offs, in which they lost 4–2 on aggregate to Brackley Town. However, after finishing fourth the following season, they beat Hednesford Town 4–3 on aggregate in the semi-finals and then defeated Guiseley 2–1 in the final to earn promotion back to the Conference National. In 2015–16 the club finished in the relegation zone and were relegated to the renamed National League North. The following season they finished bottom of the National League North, leading to a second successive relegation to the Premier Division of the Northern Premier League. However, the 2017–18 season saw the club win the Northern Premier League title, earning promotion back to the National League North. In 2018–19 Altrincham finished fifth in the National League North, earning a place in the play-offs; in the quarter finals, they drew 2–2 with Blyth Spartans before winning 7–6 in a penalty shootout, setting up a semi- final tie with Chorley, which they lost 3–1 on penalties after a 1–1 draw. The following season ended with a sixth-place finish, resulting in another play- off campaign. After defeating Chester 3–2 and York City 2–0, the club beat Boston United 1–0 in the final, earning promotion to the National League. =FA Cup giant-killers= Altrincham have a history of giant-killing in the FA Cup, holding the record of knocking out more Football League sides than any other club that has spent its entire history playing in non-League. They reached the third round of the FA Cup in four consecutive seasons between 1978–79 and 1981–82, holding a better record in the competition than any club playing in the Third or Fourth divisions during this period. To date the club has recorded seventeen victories against Football League clubs: #1921–22: Tranmere Rovers defeated 4–2 in the fourth qualifying round #1965–66: Rochdale defeated 3–1 in the second round #1973–74: Hartlepool defeated 2–1 in the first round #1974–75: Scunthorpe United defeated 3–1 in a first round replay #1979–80: Crewe Alexandra defeated 3–0 in the first round #1979–80: Rotherham United defeated 2–0 in the second round #1980–81: Scunthorpe United defeated 1–0 in a second round replay #1981–82: Sheffield United defeated 3–0 in a first round replay #1981–82: York City defeated 4–3 in a second round replay #1982–83: Rochdale defeated 2–1 in the first round #1984–85: Blackpool defeated 1–0 in the first round #1985–86: Blackpool defeated 2–1 in the second round #1985–86: Birmingham City defeated 2–1 in the third round #1988–89: Lincoln City defeated 3–2 in the first round #1992–93: Chester City defeated 2–0 in a second round replay #1994–95: Wigan Athletic defeated 1–0 in the second round #2015–16: Barnsley defeated 1–0 in the first round Current squad Altrincham F.C. =Out on loan= Honours *National League **Champions 1979–80, 1980–81 **Bob Lord Trophy winners 1980–81 *Northern Premier League **Premier Division champions 1998–99, 2017–18 **Challenge Cup winners 1969–70, 1997–98 **Challenge Shield winners 1979–80, 1998–99 *Manchester League **Champions 1904–05, 1906–07 *Cheshire County League **Champions 1965–66, 1966–67 *FA Trophy **Winners: 1977–78, 1985–86 *Cheshire Senior Cup **Winners 1904–05, 1933–34, 1966–67, 1981–82, 1998–99, 2004–05, 2008–09 **League Cup winners 1932–33, 1950–51, 1963–64 *Cheshire Amateur Cup **Winners 1903–04 Records *Best FA Cup performance: Fourth round, 1985–86 *Record attendance: 10,275, Altrincham Boys vs Sunderland Boys, 28 February 1925Club Information Altrincham F.C. *Record transfer fee paid: £15,000 to Blackpool for Keith Russell, 1998 *Record transfer fee received: £50,000 from Leicester City for Kevin Ellison, 2001 *Record victory: 14–2 vs Sale Holmfield, Cheshire Amateur Cup, 5 December 1903 *Record defeat: 13–1 vs Stretford, 4 November 1893 *Most appearances: Stuart Coburn, 689 (1997–2002, 2003–2016)\\"Stuart Coburn\\", The Non-League Football Paper, 25 June 2017 *Most goals: Jackie Swindells, 252 (1965–1971)Mike Williams & Tony Williams (2012) Non-League Club Directory 2013, p165 See also *Altrincham F.C. players *Altrincham F.C. managers References External links * Category:1891 establishments in England Category:Association football clubs established in 1891 Category:Cheshire County League Category:Football clubs in England Category:Football clubs in Trafford Category:Lancashire Combination Category:Manchester Football League Category:National League (English football) Category:Northern Premier League clubs ","title":"Altrincham F.C."},{"id":"2139210","text":"Clyde LaVerne Herring (May 3, 1879September 15, 1945), an American politician and Democrat, served as the 26th Governor of Iowa, and then one of its U.S. Senators, during the last part of the Great Depression and the first part of World War II.

Early career In 1897, at 18, he moved to Detroit, Michigan and became a jewelry clerk.\\"Rural Revelry, Time magazine, September 9, 1935. Enlisting in the military, he served during the Spanish–American War as a private in Company D of the Third Michigan Regiment. After the war, he moved to Colorado Springs, Colorado, where he engaged in ranching from 1902 to 1906. He then moved to Massena, Iowa, where he farmed for two years (1906–1908). As Time Magazine would recount in a 1935 cover story featuring him, \\"in Detroit he had fixed Henry Ford's watch, thus came to know that rising automobile manufacturer.

Returning to civilian life in Des Moines, as America entered the First World War, Herring led local fundraising efforts as the chair of the Greater Des Moines Committee, and he was invited to Washington to advise the federal government on speeding up production of war supplies.\\"Herring Asked to Give Time to Government,\\" Des Moines Daily News, 1918-05-18, at 3. Political career Herring was the unsuccessful Democratic nominee for Governor of Iowa in 1920, losing to Republican Nathan E. Kendall, and for the United States Senate in a 1922 special election, losing to Republican Smith W. Brookhart. He held one of Iowa's seats on the Democratic National Committee from 1924 to 1928. In 1932, Herring ran again for Governor of Iowa, now against incumbent Republican Daniel Webster Turner. Herring and other Democratic candidates in Iowa won an unprecedented number of races that year, and Herring became only the second Democrat to serve as Governor of Iowa since the founding of the Republican Party, in 1854. In a 1934 rematch, Herring again defeated Turner while he led a Democratic sweep of statewide offices that kept Democrats in six of Iowa's nine U.S. House seats.\\"Entire Democratic State Ticket Won in Iowa,\\" Oelwein Daily Register, 1934-11-07, at 1. In 1936, his fourth year as governor, Herring chose not to run for re- election but instead challenged incumbent Republican U.S. Senator L. J. Dickinson. Herring defeated Dickinson by fewer than 36,000 votes. Both senators from Iowa were Democrats for the first time since 1855. His service as senator was slightly delayed to await the end of his term as Iowa's governor. Herring's reaction to Orson Welles' 1938 \\"War of the Worlds\\" broadcast received national attention. To protect listeners, he urged adoption of federal legislation \\"inducing\\" broadcasters to first submit radio programming to the Federal Communications Commission before it could be aired.\\"Herring to Press Bill for Stricter Control of Radio: Programs Shown to F. C. C. First,\\" Waterloo Daily Courier, 1938-10-31, at 1. He declared that \\"radio has no more right to present programs like that than someone has to come knocking on our door and screaming.\\" However, neither he nor anyone else presented a bill, and no such legislation was adopted. At the 1940 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Herring aspired to be picked as Franklin D. Roosevelt's vice-presidential candidate,\\"Demos Snap out of Lethargy and Hail the Chief,\\" Waterloo Daily Courier, July 17, 1940 at 1-2. but Roosevelt and the Convention instead nominated fellow Iowan Henry A. Wallace, who had served as Roosevelt's Secretary of Agriculture. Herring served only a single term as senator and failed in his first re-election bid. Roosevelt's popularity in Iowa had waned after 1936, and Democratic candidates increasingly lost re- election. In addition, disagreements or rivalries between Herring and other leading Iowa Democrats, including fellow Senator Guy M. Gillette, former governor Nelson G. Kraschel, and Vice-President Henry Wallace, hampered party unity. Herring was defeated by Iowa's Republican Governor, George A. Wilson. Herring was the last of the successful 1932 Democratic candidates in Iowa to lose a re-election bid. After serving in the Senate, he returned to the automobile business and was named by Roosevelt as the assistant administrator of the Office of Price Administration, the wartime price regulatory agency.\\"Herring Leaves on Visit to OPA Field Offices,\\" Mason City Globe- Gazette, March 12, 1943 at p. 2.

It is used for birth control, heavy menstrual periods, and to prevent excessive build of the lining of the uterus in those on estrogen replacement therapy. It is one of the most effective forms of birth control with a one-year failure rate around 0.2%. The device is placed in the uterus and lasts three to seven years. Fertility often returns quickly following removal. Side effects include irregular periods, benign ovarian cysts, pelvic pain, and depression. Rarely uterine perforation may occur. Use is not recommended during pregnancy but is safe with breastfeeding. The IUD with progestogen is a type of long-acting reversible birth control. It works by thickening the mucus at the opening of the cervix, stopping the buildup of the lining of the uterus, and occasionally preventing ovulation. The IUD with levonorgestrel was first approved for medical use in 1990 in Finland and in the United States in 2000. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. More than 120 countries have approved the device and it is used by more than 10 million women. Medical uses In addition to birth control, hormonal IUD are used for prevention and treatment of: * Heavy menstrual periods * Endometriosis and chronic pelvic pain * Adenomyosis and dysmenorrhea * Anemia * In some cases, use of a hormonal IUD may prevent a need for a hysterectomy. Advantages * Considered one of the most effective forms of reversible birth control * Can be used while breastfeeding (see also nursing mothers) * No preparations needed before sex, though routine checking of the device strings by patient and physician is advised to ensure proper placement remains intact * 90% of users who wish to become pregnant do so within 24 months of removal. * May experience lighter periods (some women stop having periods completely, see also amenorrhea) * Effective for up to three to seven years (depending on the IUD) Disadvantages * Irregular periods and spotting between periods often occurs after insertion This usually improves after three to six months. * Mild to moderate discomfort experienced during insertion procedure, including cramping or backache * Other potential adverse effects and risks =Effectiveness= After insertion, Mirena is officially sold as effective for up to five years, although several studies have shown that it remains effective through seven years. It is approved for use up to seven years in Europe. Kyleena is approved for five years and Skyla is approved for three years. The hormonal IUD is a long-acting reversible contraceptive, and is considered one of the most effective forms of birth control. The first year failure rate for the hormonal IUD is 0.1-0.2% and the five-year failure rate is 0.7-0.9%. These rates are comparable to tubal sterilization, but unlike sterilization the effects of the hormonal IUD are reversible. The hormonal IUD is considered to be more effective than other common forms of reversible contraception, such as the birth control pill, because it requires little action by the user after insertion. The effectiveness of other forms of birth control is mitigated (decreased) by the users themselves. If medication regimens for contraception are not followed precisely, the method becomes less effective. IUDs require no daily, weekly, or monthly regimen, so their typical use failure rate is therefore the same as their perfect use failure rate. In women with bicornuate uterus and in need of contraception, two IUDs are generally applied (one in each horn) due to lack of evidence of efficacy with only one IUD. Evidence is lacking regarding progestogen IUD usage for menorrhagia in bicornuate uterus, but a case report showed good effect with a single IUD for this purpose. =Breastfeeding= Progestogen-only contraceptives such as an IUD are not believed to affect milk supply or infant growth. However, a study in the Mirena application for FDA approval found a lower continuation of breastfeeding at 75 days in hormonal IUD users (44%) versus copper IUD users (79%).FDA Medical Review p. 37. When using Mirena, about 0.1% of the maternal dose of levonorgestrel can be transferred via milk to the nursed infant.MIRENA Data Sheet, Bayer NZ, 11 December 2009http://www.bayerresources.com.au/resources/uploads/DataSheet/file9503.pdf Retrieved 2011-02-10 A six-year study of breastfed infants whose mothers used a levonorgestrel-only method of birth control found the infants had increased risk of respiratory infections and eye infections, though a lower risk of neurological conditions, compared to infants whose mothers used a copper IUD. No longer-term studies have been performed to assess the long-term effects on infants of levonorgestrel in breast milk. There are conflicting recommendations about use of Mirena while breastfeeding. The U.S. CDC does not recommend any hormonal method as a first choice of contraceptive for nursing mothers, although progestin-only methods, such as Mirena, may be used with close follow-up or when the benefits outweigh the risks. The World Health Organization recommends against immediate postpartum insertion, citing increased expulsion rates. It also reports concerns about potential effects on the infant's liver and brain development in the first six weeks postpartum. However, it recommends offering Mirena as a contraceptive option beginning at six weeks postpartum even to nursing women. Planned Parenthood offers Mirena as a contraceptive option for breastfeeding women beginning at four weeks postpartum. Contraindications A hormonal IUD should not be used by women who: * Are, or think they may be, pregnant * Have abnormal vaginal bleeding that has not been explained (controversial) * Have untreated cervical or uterine cancer * Have, or may have, breast cancer * Have abnormalities of the cervix or uterus (controversial) * Have had pelvic inflammatory disease within the past three months * Have had an STI such as chlamydia or gonorrhea within the past three months * Have liver disease or tumor * Have an allergy to levonorgestrel or any of the inactive ingredients included in the device Insertion of an IUD is acceptable after a D&E; abortion (second-trimester abortion), but may be associated with a higher expulsion rate. To reduce the risk of infection, insertion of an IUD is not recommended for women that have had a medical abortion but have not yet had an ultrasound to confirm that the abortion was complete, or that have not yet had their first menstruation following the medical abortion. A full list of contraindications can be found in the WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use and the CDC \\"United States Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use. Side effects * Irregular menstrual pattern: irregular bleeding and spotting is common in the first three to six months of use. After that time periods become shorter and lighter, and 20% of women stop having periods after one year of use. The average user reports 16 days of bleeding or spotting in the first month of use, but this diminishes to about four days at 12 months. * Cramping and pain: many women feel discomfort or pain during and immediately after insertion. Some women may have cramping for the first 1–2 weeks after insertion. * Expulsion: Sometimes the IUD can slip out of the uterus. This is termed expulsion. Around 5% of IUD users experience expulsion. If this happens a woman is not protected from pregnancy. Expulsion is more common in younger women, women who have not had children, and when an IUD is inserted immediately after childbirth or abortion. * Perforation: Very rarely, the IUD can be pushed through the wall of the uterus during insertion. Risk of perforation is mostly determined by the skill of the practitioner performing the insertion. For experienced medical practitioners, the risk of perforation is one per 1,000 insertions or less. With postpartum insertions, perforation of the uterus is more likely to occur when uterine involution is incomplete; involution usually completes by 4–6 weeks postpartum. Special considerations apply to women who plan to breastfeed. If perforation does occur it can damage the internal organs, and in some cases surgery is needed to remove the IUD. * Pregnancy complications: Although the risk of pregnancy with an IUD is very small, if one does occur there is an increased risk of serious problems. These include ectopic pregnancy, infection, miscarriage, and early labor and delivery. As many as half the pregnancies that occur in Mirena users may be ectopic. The incidence rate of ectopic pregnancies is approximately one per 1000 users per year.FDA Medical Review pp. 3-4 Immediate removal of the IUD is recommended in the case of pregnancy. No pattern of birth defects was found in the 35 babies for whom birth outcomes were available at the time of FDA approval.FDA Medical Review p. 5,41 * Infection: The insertion of the IUD does have a small risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Concurrent infection with gonorrhea or chlamydia at the time of insertion increases the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease. If PID does occur, it will most likely happen within 21 days of insertion. The device itself does not increase the risk of infection. * Ovarian cysts: Enlarged follicles (ovarian cysts) have been diagnosed in about 12% of the subjects using a hormonal IUD in studies that use ultrasound to look for cysts, even if asymptomatic. In studies that only evaluate symptomatic cysts, only 4.5% of women complain of any ovarian cysts over 5 or more years of use, and only 0.3% require IUD removal for ovarian cysts. Thus, any issues with ovarian cysts are not of a clinically relevant nature. Most of these follicles are asymptomatic, although some may be accompanied by pelvic pain or dyspareunia. In most cases the enlarged follicles disappear spontaneously after two to three months. Surgical intervention is not usually required. * Mental health changes including: nervousness, depressed mood, mood swings * Weight gain * Headache, migraine * Nausea * Acne * Excessive hairiness * Lower abdominal or back pain * Decreased libido * Itching, redness or swelling of the vagina * Vaginal discharge * Breast pain, tenderness * Edema * Abdominal distension * Cervicitis * May affect glucose tolerance * May experience a change in vision or contact lens tolerance * May deplete Vitamin B1 which can affect energy, mood, and nervous system functioning * A \\"lost coil\\" occurs when the thread cannot be felt by a woman on routine checking and is not seen on speculum examination. Various thread collector devices or simple forceps may then be used to try to grasp the device through the cervix. In the rare cases when this is unsuccessful, an ultrasound scan may be arranged to check the position of the coil and exclude its perforation through into the abdominal cavity or its unrecognised previous expulsion. =Cancer= According to a 1999 evaluation of the studies performed on progestin-only birth control by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, there is some evidence that progestin-only birth control reduces the risk of endometrial cancer. The IARC concluded that there is no evidence progestin-only birth control increases the risk of any cancer, though the available studies were too small to be definitively conclusive. Progesterone is a hormone in the endometrium that counteracts estrogen driven growth. Very low levels of progesterone will cause estrogen to act more, leading to endometrial hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma. These effects can be minimized if treated with progestin, but not in very many cases. Estrogen and progesterone have an antagonistic relationship. Estrogen promotes the growing of endometrial lining, while progesterone limits it. In the case of endometrial cancer, progesterone can negatively regulate estrogen driven growth. Tumors formed are correlated with insufficient progesterone and excess estrogen. In patients with endometrial cancer who use progestin releasing IUDs concluded mixed results. =Bone density= No evidence has been identified to suggest Mirena affects bone mineral density (BMD). Two small studies, limited to studying BMD in the forearm, show no decrease in BMD. One of the studies showed at seven years of use, similar BMD at the midshaft of the ulna and at the distal radius as nonusers matched by age and BMI. In addition, BMD measurements were similar to the expected values for women in the same age group as the participants. The authors of the study said their results were predictable, since it is well established that the main factor responsible for bone loss in women is hypoestrogenism, and, in agreement with previous reports, they found estradiol levels in Mirena users to be normal. Composition and hormonal release Mirena IUD visible on pelvic radiograph. The hormonal IUD is a small 'T'-shaped piece of plastic, which contains levonorgestrel, a type of progestin., Bayer Pharmaceuticals. The cylinder of the device is coated with a membrane that regulates the release of the drug. Bayer markets Skyla as Jaydess in the United Kingdom. Jaydess releases six micrograms per day and lasts for three years. In comparison, oral contraceptives can contain 150 micrograms of levonorgestrel. p.150: > Mechanism of action > Although the precise mechanism of action is not known, currently available > IUCs work primarily by preventing sperm from fertilizing ova.26 IUCs are not > abortifacients: they do not interrupt an implanted pregnancy.27 Pregnancy is > prevented by a combination of the \\"foreign body effect\\" of the plastic or > metal frame and the specific action of the medication (copper or > levonorgestrel) that is released.

Most of the drug stays inside the uterus, and only a small amount is absorbed into the rest of the body. Insertion and removal Schematic depiction of vaginal ultrasonography of a Mirena. Vaginal ultrasonography showing a Mirena in optimal place in the uterus, as viewed from angle shown in schematic depiction. The hormonal IUD is inserted in a similar procedure to the nonhormonal copper IUD, and can only be inserted by a qualified medical practitioner. Before insertion, a pelvic exam is performed to examine the shape and position of the uterus. A current STI at the time of insertion can increase the risk of pelvic infection. However, routine screening for gonorrhea and chlamydia prior to insertion is not recommended. If a person needs screening and there is no evidence of infection on examination or has been previously screened, insertion of the IUD does not need to be delayed. =Insertion= During the insertion, the vagina is held open with a speculum, the same device used during a pap smear. A grasping instrument is used to steady the cervix, the length of the uterus is measured for proper insertion with a uterine sound for decreasing chance of uterine perforation with the IUD, and the IUD is placed using a narrow tube through the opening of the cervix into the uterus. A short length of monofilament plastic/nylon string hangs down from the cervix into the vagina. The string allows physicians and patients to check to ensure the IUD is still in place and enables easy removal of the device. Mild to moderate cramping can occur during the procedure, which generally takes five minutes or less. Insertion can be performed immediately postpartum and post-abortion if no infection has occurred. Misoprostol is not effective in reducing pain in IUD insertion. =Removal= Removal of the device should also be performed by a qualified medical practitioner. After removal, fertility will return to previous levels relatively quickly. One study found that the majority of participants returned to fertility within three months. Mechanisms of action Levonorgestrel is a progestogen, i.e. progesterone-receptor agonist. The hormonal IUD's primary mechanism of action is to prevent fertilization. p.

The levonorgestrel intrauterine system has several contraceptive effects, although thickening of the cervical mucus appears to be the primary effect. Other effects include making the inside of the uterus becomes fatal to sperm and thinning of the endometrial lining, but this is not the usual function. Ovulation is not inhibited in all cases. Numerous studies have demonstrated that IUDs primarily prevent fertilization, not implantation. In one experiment involving tubal flushing, fertilized eggs were found in half of women not using contraception, but no fertilized eggs were found in women using IUDs. IUDs also decrease the risk of ectopic pregnancy, which further implies that IUDs prevent fertilization. History Hormonal IUDs were developed in the 1970s following the development of the copper IUD in the 1960s and 1970s. Dr. Antonio Scommenga, working at the Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago, discovered that administering progesterone inside the uterus could have contraceptive benefits. With knowledge of Scommegna's work, a Finnish doctor, Jouni Valtteri Tapani Luukkainen, created the 'T'-shaped IUD that released progesterone, marketed as the Progestasert System in 1976. This IUD had a short, 1-year lifespan and never achieved widespread popularity. Following this relative lack of success, Dr. Luukkainen replaced the progesterone with the hormone levonorgestrel to be released over a five-year period, creating what is now Mirena. The Mirena IUD was studied for safety and efficacy in two clinical trials in Finland and Sweden involving 1,169 women who were all between 18 and 35 years of age at the beginning of the trials. The trials included predominantly Caucasian women who had been previously pregnant with no history of ectopic pregnancy or pelvic inflammatory disease within the previous year. Over 70% of the participants had previously used IUDs. In 2013 Skyla, a lower dose levonorgestrel IUD effective for up to three years, was approved by the FDA.FDA drug approval for Skyla Skyla has a different bleeding pattern than Mirena, with only 6% of women in clinical trials becoming amenorrheic (compared to approximately 20% with Mirena).  Controversies  In 2009, Bayer, the maker of Mirena, was issued an FDA Warning Letter by the United States Food and Drug Administration for overstating the efficacy, minimizing the risks of use, and making \\"false or misleading presentations\\" about the device. From 2000 to 2013, the federal agency received over 70,072 complaints about the device and related adverse effects. As of April 2014, over 1,200 lawsuits have been filed in the United States.

Each can be defined in essentially two different ways: either by constructing an explicit well-ordered set which represents the operation or by using transfinite recursion. Cantor normal form provides a standardized way of writing ordinals. In addition to these usual ordinal operations, there are also the \\"natural\\" arithmetic of ordinals and the nimber operations.  Addition  The union of two disjoint well-ordered sets S and T can be well- ordered. The order-type of that union is the ordinal which results from adding the order-types of S and T. If two well-ordered sets are not already disjoint, then they can be replaced by order-isomorphic disjoint sets, e.g. replace S by {0} × S and T by {1} × T. This way, the well-ordered set S is written \\"to the left\\" of the well-ordered set T, meaning one defines an order on S \\\\cup T in which every element of S is smaller than every element of T. The sets S and T themselves keep the ordering they already have. This addition of the order- types is associative and generalizes the addition of natural numbers. The first transfinite ordinal is ω, the set of all natural numbers. For example, the ordinal ω + ω is obtained by two copies of the natural numbers ordered in the usual fashion and the second copy completely to the right of the first. Writing 0' < 1' < 2' < ... for the second copy, ω + ω looks like :0 < 1 < 2 < 3 < ... < 0' < 1' < 2' < ... This is different from ω because in ω only 0 does not have a direct predecessor while in ω + ω the two elements 0 and 0' do not have direct predecessors. As another example, here are 3 + ω and ω + 3: :0 < 1 < 2 < 0' < 1' < 2' < ... :0 < 1 < 2 < ... < 0' < 1' < 2' After relabeling, the former just looks like ω itself, i.e. 3 + ω = ω, while the latter does not: is not equal to ω since has a largest element (namely, 2') and ω does not (even if ω and are equipotent, they are not isomorphic). Hence, this addition is not commutative. In fact it is quite rare for α+β to be equal to β+α: this happens if and only if α=γm, β=γn for some ordinal γ and natural numbers m and n. From this it follows that \\"α commutes with β\\" is an equivalence relation on the class of nonzero ordinals, and all the equivalence classes are countably infinite. However, addition is still associative; one can see for example that (ω + 4) + ω = ω + (4 + ω) = ω + ω. The definition of addition can also be given inductively (the following induction is on β): * α + 0 = α, * α + (β + 1) = (α + β) + 1 (here, \\"+ 1\\" denotes the successor of an ordinal), * and if β is a limit ordinal then α + β is the limit of α + δ for all δ < β. Using this definition, ω + 3 can be seen to be a successor ordinal (it is the successor of ω + 2), whereas 3 + ω is a limit ordinal, namely, the limit of 3 + 0 = 3, 3 + 1 = 4, 3 + 2 = 5, etc., which is just ω. Zero is an additive identity α + 0 = 0 + α = α. Addition is associative (α + β) + γ = α + (β + γ). Addition is strictly increasing and continuous in the right argument: :\\\\alpha < \\\\beta \\\\Rightarrow \\\\gamma + \\\\alpha < \\\\gamma + \\\\beta but the analogous relation does not hold for the left argument; instead we only have: :\\\\alpha < \\\\beta \\\\Rightarrow \\\\alpha+\\\\gamma \\\\le \\\\beta+\\\\gamma Ordinal addition is left- cancellative: if α + β = α + γ, then β = γ. Furthermore, one can define left subtraction for ordinals β ≤ α: there is a unique γ such that α = β + γ. On the other hand, right cancellation does not work: :3+\\\\omega = 0+\\\\omega = \\\\omega but 3 eq 0 Nor does right subtraction, even when β ≤ α: for example, there does not exist any γ such that γ + 42 = ω. If the ordinals less than α are closed under addition and contain 0 then α is occasionally called a γ-number (see additively indecomposable ordinal). These are exactly the ordinals of the form ωβ.  Multiplication  The Cartesian product, S×T, of two well-ordered sets S and T can be well-ordered by a variant of lexicographical order that puts the least significant position first. Effectively, each element of T is replaced by a disjoint copy of S. The order- type of the Cartesian product is the ordinal which results from multiplying the order-types of S and T. Again, this operation is associative and generalizes the multiplication of natural numbers. Here is ω·2: :00 < 10 < 20 < 30 < ... < 01 < 11 < 21 < 31 < ... which has the same order type as ω + ω. In contrast, 2·ω looks like this: :00 < 10 < 01 < 11 < 02 < 12 < 03 < 13 < ... and after relabeling, this looks just like ω. Thus, ω·2 = ω+ω ≠ ω = 2·ω, showing that multiplication of ordinals is not commutative. More generally, a natural number greater than 1 never commutes with any infinite ordinal, and two infinite ordinals α, β commute if and only if αm = βn for some positive natural numbers m and n. The relation \\"α commutes with β\\" is an equivalence relation on the ordinals greater than 1, and all equivalence classes are countably infinite. Distributivity partially holds for ordinal arithmetic: R(S+T) = RS+RT. However, the other distributive law (T+U)R = TR+UR is not generally true: (1+1)·ω = 2·ω = ω while 1·ω+1·ω = ω+ω which is different. Therefore, the ordinal numbers form a left near-semiring, but do not form a ring. The definition of multiplication can also be given inductively (the following induction is on β): * α·0 = 0, * α·(β+1) = (α·β)+α, * and if β is a limit ordinal then α·β is the limit of the α·δ for δ < β. The main properties of the product are: *α·0 = 0·α = 0. *One (1) is a multiplicative identity α·1 = 1·α = α. *Multiplication is associative (α·β)·γ = α·(β·γ). *Multiplication is strictly increasing and continuous in the right argument: (α < β and γ > 0) \\\\Rightarrow γ·α < γ·β *Multiplication is not strictly increasing in the left argument, for example, 1 < 2 but 1·ω = 2·ω = ω. However, it is (non-strictly) increasing, i.e. α ≤ β \\\\Rightarrow α·γ ≤ β·γ. *There is a left cancellation law: If α > 0 and α·β = α·γ, then β = γ. *Right cancellation does not work, e.g. 1·ω = 2·ω = ω, but 1 and 2 are different. *α·β = 0 \\\\Rightarrow α = 0 or β = 0. *Distributive law on the left: α·(β+γ) = α·β+α·γ *No distributive law on the right: e.g. (ω+1)·2 = ω+1+ω+1 = ω+ω+1 = ω·2+1 which is not ω·2+2. *Left division with remainder: for all α and β, if β > 0, then there are unique γ and δ such that α = β·γ+δ and δ < β. (This does not however mean the ordinals are a Euclidean domain, since they are not even a ring, and the Euclidean \\"norm\\" is ordinal-valued.) *Right division does not work: there is no α such that α·ω ≤ ωω ≤ (α+1)·ω. A δ-number (see additively indecomposable ordinal#Multiplicatively indecomposable) is an ordinal greater than 1 such that αδ=δ whenever 0<α<δ. These consist of the ordinal 2 and the ordinals of the form ωωβ.  Exponentiation  The definition of ordinal exponentiation for finite exponents is straightforward. If the exponent is a finite number, the power is the result of iterated multiplication. For instance, ω2 = ω·ω using the operation of ordinal multiplication. Note that ω·ω can be defined using the set of functions from 2 = {0,1} to ω = {0,1,2,...}, ordered lexicographically with the least significant position first: :(0,0) < (1,0) < (2,0) < (3,0) < ... < (0,1) < (1,1) < (2,1) < (3,1) < ... < (0,2) < (1,2) < (2,2) < ... Here for brevity, we have replaced the function {(0,k), (1,m)} by the ordered pair (k, m). Similarly, for any finite exponent n, \\\\omega^n can be defined using the set of functions from n (the domain) to the natural numbers (the codomain). These functions can be abbreviated as n-tuples of natural numbers. But for infinite exponents, the definition may not be obvious. A limit ordinal, such as ωω, is the supremum of all smaller ordinals. It might seem natural to define ωω using the set of all infinite sequences of natural numbers. However, we find that any absolutely defined ordering on this set is not well-ordered. To deal with this issue we can use the variant lexicographical ordering again. We restrict the set to sequences which are nonzero for only a finite number of arguments. This is naturally motivated as the limit of the finite powers of the base (similar to the concept of coproduct in algebra). This can also be thought of as the infinite union \\\\bigcup_{n<\\\\omega}\\\\omega^n. Each of those sequences corresponds to an ordinal less than \\\\omega^\\\\omega such as \\\\omega^{n_1} c_1 + \\\\omega^{n_2} c_2 + \\\\cdots + \\\\omega^{n_k} c_k and \\\\omega^\\\\omega is the supremum of all those smaller ordinals. The lexicographical order on this set is a well ordering that resembles the ordering of natural numbers written in decimal notation, except with digit positions reversed, and with arbitrary natural numbers instead of just the digits 0–9: :(0,0,0,...) < (1,0,0,0,...) < (2,0,0,0,...) < ... < :(0,1,0,0,0,...) < (1,1,0,0,0,...) < (2,1,0,0,0,...) < ... < :(0,2,0,0,0,...) < (1,2,0,0,0,...) < (2,2,0,0,0,...) :: < ... < :(0,0,1,0,0,0,...) < (1,0,1,0,0,0,...) < (2,0,1,0,0,0,...) :: < ... In general, any ordinal α can be raised to the power of another ordinal β in the same way to get αβ. It is easiest to explain this using Von Neumann's definition of an ordinal as the set of all smaller ordinals. Then, to construct a set of order type αβ consider all functions from β to α such that only a finite number of elements of the domain β map to a non zero element of α (essentially, we consider the functions with finite support). The order is lexicographic with the least significant position first. We find * 1ω = 1, * 2ω = ω, * 2ω+1 = ω·2 = ω+ω. The definition of exponentiation can also be given inductively (the following induction is on β, the exponent): * α0 = 1, * αβ+1 = (αβ)·α, and * if β is a limit ordinal, then αβ is the limit of the αδ for all δ < β. Properties of ordinal exponentiation: *α0 = 1. *If 0 < α, then 0α = 0. *1α = 1. *α1 = α. *αβ·αγ = αβ + γ. * (αβ)γ = αβ·γ. *There are α, β, and γ for which (α·β)γ ≠ αγ·βγ. For instance, (ω·2)2 = ω·2·ω·2 = ω2·2 ≠ ω2·4. *Ordinal exponentiation is strictly increasing and continuous in the right argument: If γ > 1 and α < β, then γα < γβ. *If α < β, then αγ ≤ βγ. Note, for instance, that 2 < 3 and yet 2ω = 3ω = ω. *If α > 1 and αβ = αγ, then β = γ. If α = 1 or α = 0 this is not the case. *For all α and β, if β > 1 and α > 0 then there exist unique γ, δ, and ρ such that α = βγ·δ + ρ such that 0 < δ < β and ρ < βγ. While the same notation is used for ordinal exponentiation and cardinal exponentiation, ordinal exponentiation is quite different from cardinal exponentiation. For example, with ordinal exponentiation 2^\\\\omega = \\\\omega, but for \\\\aleph_0(aleph naught, the cardinality of \\\\omega), 2^{\\\\aleph_0} > \\\\aleph_0. Here, 2^{\\\\aleph_0} is the cardinality of the set of all functions from the set of all natural numbers to a set with two elements. (This is the cardinality of the power set of the set of all natural numbers and is equal to \\\\mathfrak c, the cardinality of the continuum.) To avoid confusing ordinal exponentiation with cardinal exponentiation, one can use symbols for ordinals (e.g. ω) in the former and symbols for cardinals (e.g. \\\\aleph_0) in the latter. Jacobsthal showed that the only solutions of αβ = βα with α ≤ β are given by α = β, or α = 2 and β = 4, or α is any limit ordinal and β = εα where ε is an ε-number larger than α.Ernst Jacobsthal, Vertauschbarkeit transfiniter Ordnungszahlen, Mathematische Annalen, Bd 64 (1907), 475-488. Available here  Cantor normal form  Every ordinal number α can be uniquely written as \\\\omega^{\\\\beta_1} c_1 + \\\\omega^{\\\\beta_2}c_2 + \\\\cdots + \\\\omega^{\\\\beta_k}c_k, where k is a natural number, c_1, c_2, \\\\ldots, c_k are positive integers, and \\\\beta_1 > \\\\beta_2 > \\\\ldots > \\\\beta_k \\\\geq 0 are ordinal numbers. This decomposition of α is called the Cantor normal form of α, and can be considered the base-ω positional numeral system. The highest exponent \\\\beta_1 is called the degree of \\\\alpha, and satisfies \\\\beta_1\\\\le\\\\alpha. The equality \\\\beta_1=\\\\alpha applies if and only if \\\\alpha=\\\\omega^\\\\alpha. In that case Cantor normal form does not express the ordinal in terms of smaller ones; this can happen as explained below. A minor variation of Cantor normal form, which is usually slightly easier to work with, is to set all the numbers ci equal to 1 and allow the exponents to be equal. In other words, every ordinal number α can be uniquely written as \\\\omega^{\\\\beta_1} + \\\\omega^{\\\\beta_2} + \\\\cdots + \\\\omega^{\\\\beta_k}, where k is a natural number, and \\\\beta_1 \\\\ge \\\\beta_2 \\\\ge \\\\ldots \\\\ge \\\\beta_k \\\\ge 0 are ordinal numbers. Another variation of the Cantor normal form is the \\"base δ expansion\\", where ω is replaced by any ordinal δ>1, and the numbers ci are positive ordinals less than δ. The Cantor normal form allows us to uniquely express--and order--the ordinals α that are built from the natural numbers by a finite number of arithmetical operations of addition, multiplication and exponentiation base-\\\\omega: in other words, assuming \\\\beta_1<\\\\alpha in the Cantor normal form, we can also express the exponents \\\\beta_i in Cantor normal form, and making the same assumption for the \\\\beta_i as for α and so on recursively, we get a system of notation for these ordinals (for example, :\\\\omega^{\\\\left( \\\\omega^{\\\\left( \\\\omega^7\\\\cdot6+\\\\omega+42 \\\\right)}\\\\cdot1729+\\\\omega^9+88 \\\\right)}\\\\cdot3+\\\\omega^{\\\\left( \\\\omega^\\\\omega \\\\right)}\\\\cdot5+65537 denotes an ordinal). The ordinal ε0 (epsilon nought) is the set of ordinal values α of the finite-length arithmetical expressions of Cantor normal form that are hereditarily non-trivial where non-trivial means β1<α when 0<α. It is the smallest ordinal that does not have a finite arithmetical expression in terms of ω, and the smallest ordinal such that \\\\varepsilon_0 = \\\\omega^{\\\\varepsilon_0}, i.e. in Cantor normal form the exponent is not smaller than the ordinal itself. It is the limit of the sequence :0, \\\\, 1=\\\\omega^0, \\\\, \\\\omega=\\\\omega^1, \\\\, \\\\omega^\\\\omega, \\\\, \\\\omega^{\\\\omega^\\\\omega}, \\\\, \\\\ldots \\\\,. The ordinal ε0 is important for various reasons in arithmetic (essentially because it measures the proof-theoretic strength of the first-order Peano arithmetic: that is, Peano's axioms can show transfinite induction up to any ordinal less than ε0 but not up to ε0 itself). The Cantor normal form also allows us to compute sums and products of ordinals: to compute the sum, for example, one need merely know that :\\\\omega^{\\\\beta} c+\\\\omega^{\\\\beta'} c' = \\\\omega^{\\\\beta'}c' \\\\,, if \\\\beta'>\\\\beta (if \\\\beta'=\\\\beta one can apply the distributive law on the left and rewrite this as \\\\omega^{\\\\beta} (c+c'), and if \\\\beta'<\\\\beta the expression is already in Cantor normal form); and to compute products, the essential facts are that when 0 < \\\\alpha = \\\\omega^{\\\\beta_1} c_1 + \\\\cdots + \\\\omega^{\\\\beta_k}c_k is in Cantor normal form and 0 < \\\\beta' , then :\\\\alpha\\\\omega^{\\\\beta'} = \\\\omega^{\\\\beta_1 + \\\\beta'} \\\\, and :\\\\alpha n = \\\\omega^{\\\\beta_1} c_1 n + \\\\omega^{\\\\beta_2} c_2 + \\\\cdots + \\\\omega^{\\\\beta_k}c_k \\\\,, if n is a non-zero natural number. To compare two ordinals written in Cantor normal form, first compare \\\\beta_1, then c_1, then \\\\beta_2, then c_2, etc.. At the first difference, the ordinal that has the larger component is the larger ordinal. If they are the same until one terminates before the other, then the one that terminates first is smaller. Factorization into primes Ernst Jacobsthal showed that the ordinals satisfy a form of the unique factorization theorem: every nonzero ordinal can be written as a product of a finite number of prime ordinals. This factorization into prime ordinals is in general not unique, but there is a \\"minimal\\" factorization into primes that is unique up to changing the order of finite prime factors . A prime ordinal is an ordinal greater than 1 that cannot be written as a product of two smaller ordinals. Some of the first primes are 2, 3, 5, ... , ω, ω+1, ω2+1, ω3+1, ..., ωω, ωω+1, ωω+1+1, ... There are three sorts of prime ordinals: *The finite primes 2, 3, 5, ... *The ordinals of the form ωωα for any ordinal α. These are the prime ordinals that are limits, and are the delta numbers. *The ordinals of the form ωα+1 for any ordinal α>0. These are the infinite successor primes, and are the successors of gamma numbers, the additively indecomposable ordinals. Factorization into primes is not unique: for example, 2×3=3×2, 2×ω=ω, (ω+1)×ω=ω×ω and ω×ωω = ωω. However, there is a unique factorization into primes satisfying the following additional conditions: *Every limit prime occurs before every successor prime *If two consecutive primes of the prime factorization are both limits or both finite, then the second one is at most the first one. This prime factorization can easily be read off using the Cantor normal form as follows: *First write the ordinal as a product αβ where α is the smallest power of ω in the Cantor normal form and β is a successor. *If α=ωγ then writing γ in Cantor normal form gives an expansion of α as a product of limit primes. *Now look at the Cantor normal form of β. If β = ωλm + ωμn + smaller terms, then β = (ωμn + smaller terms)(ωλ−μ \\\\+ 1)m is a product of a smaller ordinal and a prime and an integer m. Repeating this and factorizing the integers into primes gives the prime factorization of β. So the factorization of the Cantor normal form ordinal :\\\\omega^{\\\\alpha_1}n_1+\\\\cdots +\\\\omega^{\\\\alpha_k}n_k (with \\\\alpha_1>\\\\cdots>\\\\alpha_k) into a minimal product of infinite primes and integers is :\\\\omega^{\\\\omega^{\\\\beta_1}}\\\\cdots\\\\omega^{\\\\omega^{\\\\beta_m}}n_k(\\\\omega^{\\\\alpha_{k-1}-\\\\alpha_k}+1)n_{k-1}\\\\cdots n_2(\\\\omega^{\\\\alpha_{1}-\\\\alpha_2}+1)n_1 where each ni should be replaced by its factorization into a non-increasing sequence of finite primes and :\\\\alpha_k=\\\\omega^{\\\\beta_1}+\\\\cdots +\\\\omega^{\\\\beta_m} with \\\\beta_1\\\\ge\\\\cdots\\\\ge\\\\beta_m. Large countable ordinals As discussed above, the Cantor Normal Form of ordinals below \\\\varepsilon_0 can be expressed in an alphabet containing only the function symbols for addition, multiplication and exponentiation, as well as constant symbols for each natural number and for \\\\omega. We can do away with the infinitely many numerals by using just the constant symbol 0 and the operation of successor, S (for example, the integer 4 may be expressed as S(S(S(S(0))))). This describes an ordinal notation: a system for naming ordinals over a finite alphabet. This particular system of ordinal notation is called the collection of arithmetical ordinal expressions, and can express all ordinals below \\\\varepsilon_0, but cannot express \\\\varepsilon_0. There are other ordinal notations capable of capturing ordinals well past \\\\varepsilon_0, but because there are only countably many strings over any finite alphabet, for any given ordinal notation there will be ordinals below \\\\omega_1 (the first uncountable ordinal) that are not expressible. Such ordinals are known as large countable ordinals. The operations of addition, multiplication and exponentiation are all examples of primitive recursive ordinal functions, and more general primitive recursive ordinal functions can be used to describe larger ordinals.  Natural operations  The natural sum and natural product operations on ordinals were defined in 1906 by Gerhard Hessenberg, and are sometimes called the Hessenberg sum (or product) . These are the same as the addition and multiplication (restricted to ordinals) of John Conway's field of surreal numbers. They have the advantage that they are associative and commutative, and natural product distributes over natural sum. The cost of making these operations commutative is that they lose the continuity in the right argument which is a property of the ordinary sum and product. The natural sum of α and β is often denoted by α⊕β or α#β, and the natural product by α⊗β or α⨳β. The natural operations come up in the theory of well partial orders; given two well partial orders S and T, of types (maximum linearizations) o(S) and o(T), the type of the disjoint union is o(S)⊕o(T), while the type of the direct product is o(S)⊗o(T).D. H. J. De Jongh and R. Parikh, Well-partial orderings and hierarchies, Indag. Math. 39 (1977), 195–206. Available here One may take this relation as a definition of the natural operations by choosing S and T to be ordinals α and β; so α⊕β is the maximum order type of a total order extending the disjoint union (as a partial order) of α and β; while α⊗β is the maximum order type of a total order extending the direct product (as a partial order) of α and β.Philip W. Carruth, Arithmetic of ordinals with applications to the theory of ordered Abelian groups, Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 48 (1942), 262–271. See Theorem 1. Available here A useful application of this is when α and β are both subsets of some larger total order; then their union has order type at most α⊕β. If they are both subsets of some ordered abelian group, then their sum has order type at most α⊗β. We can also define the natural sum of α and β inductively (by simultaneous induction on α and β) as the smallest ordinal greater than the natural sum of α and γ for all γ < β and of γ and β for all γ < α. There is also an inductive definition of the natural product (by mutual induction), but it is somewhat tedious to write down and we shall not do so (see the article on surreal numbers for the definition in that context, which, however, uses surreal subtraction, something which obviously cannot be defined on ordinals). The natural sum is associative and commutative. It is always greater or equal to the usual sum, but it may be greater. For example, the natural sum of ω and 1 is ω+1 (the usual sum), but this is also the natural sum of 1 and ω. The natural product is associative and commutative and distributes over the natural sum. It is always greater or equal to the usual product, but it may be greater. For example, the natural product of ω and 2 is ω·2 (the usual product), but this is also the natural product of 2 and ω. Yet another way to define the natural sum and product of two ordinals α and β is to use the Cantor normal form: one can find a sequence of ordinals γ1 > … > γn and two sequences (k1, …, kn) and (j1, …, jn) of natural numbers (including zero, but satisfying ki \\\\+ ji > 0 for all i) such that :\\\\alpha = \\\\omega^{\\\\gamma_1}\\\\cdot k_1 + \\\\cdots +\\\\omega^{\\\\gamma_n}\\\\cdot k_n :\\\\beta = \\\\omega^{\\\\gamma_1}\\\\cdot j_1 + \\\\cdots +\\\\omega^{\\\\gamma_n}\\\\cdot j_n and defines :\\\\alpha \\\\\\\\#\\\\beta = \\\\omega^{\\\\gamma_1}\\\\cdot (k_1+j_1) + \\\\cdots +\\\\omega^{\\\\gamma_n}\\\\cdot (k_n+j_n). Under natural addition, the ordinals can be identified with the elements of the free abelian group with basis the gamma numbers ωα that have non-negative integer coefficients. Under natural addition and multiplication, the ordinals can be identified with the elements of the (commutative) polynomial ring generated by the delta numbers ωωα that have non-negative integer coefficients. The ordinals do not have unique factorization into primes under the natural product. While the full polynomial ring does have unique factorization, the subset of polynomials with non- negative coefficients does not: for example, if x is any delta number, then :x^5+x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1=(x+1)(x^4+x^2+1)=(x^2+x+1)(x^3+1) has two incompatible expressions as a natural product of polynomials with non-negative coefficients that cannot be decomposed further. Nimber arithmetic There are arithmetic operations on ordinals by virtue of the one-to-one correspondence between ordinals and nimbers. Three common operations on nimbers are nimber addition, nimber multiplication, and minimum excludance (mex). Nimber addition is a generalization of the bitwise exclusive or operation on natural numbers. The of a set of ordinals is the smallest ordinal not present in the set.

Early years Looker attended Puyallup High School in Puyallup, Washington, and won varsity letters in football and basketball. In football, he won All-State honors and made 50 receptions for 916 yards and 18 touchdowns as a senior. He won two varsity letters in basketball and graduated in 1995 with honors. College career Looker played college football at the University of Washington where he made 84 catches for 949 yards. Looker was a walk-on to the University of Washington football team in 1996 after playing basketball for two years at Western Washington University. He was named honorable mention All-Pac-10 as a senior after starting seven of 11 games, making 20 receptions for 287 yards. He led the Huskies with 64 receptions for 662 yards as a junior. He graduated with a degree in speech communications. During his time at Washington, he played under Scott Linehan, who was initially the wide receivers coach and later the offensive coordinator. Professional career =First stint with Rams= Looker was signed as an undrafted free agent by the St. Louis Rams on April 17, 2000. Looker spent 2000 training camp with the Rams before being traded to the New England Patriots on August 7. =New England Patriots= Looker made the final opening day roster with the Patriots but was listed as inactive. On November 16, 2000, the Patriots placed Looker on injured reserve due to a leg injury. On July 31, 2001, the Patriots waived Looker. =Second stint with Rams= The Rams signed Looker on August 8, 2001 and waived Looker on August 27, 2001. The Rams re-signed Looker on February 12, 2002 and assigned Looker to the NFL Europe team Berlin Thunder. Looker led Berlin to a World Bowl title and was named World Bowl Most Valuable Player after catching 11 passes for 111 yards and two touchdowns, as Berlin defeated the Rhein Fire 26-20. He was named to All-NFL Europe team and led all NFL Europe receivers in receptions (54) and receiving yards (661) during the regular season, he also scored five touchdowns. After playing in three preseason games in 2002, Looker signed with the Rams practice squad on September 9, 2002 and to the active roster on December 12. Looker played his first regular season NFL game on December 15 in the Rams' game against the Arizona Cardinals, on both offense and special teams. Looker played in the Rams' two final games of 2002 as well. In 2003, he received significant offensive action, emerging as the Rams’ third receiver with 47 receptions. His first touchdown reception came on September 14, 2003, on a 19-yard reception from quarterback Marc Bulger. Looker played in 14 games of the 2004 season. On the October 10 away game against the Seattle Seahawks, the Seattle-area native Looker made a critical, out-of-bounds 16-yard catch to bring the Rams to the 18-yard line and set up a game-tying field goal late in the fourth quarter. The Rams would win 33-27. In 2005, he caught 23 passes for 237 yards. In 2006 Looker handled holder duties all 16 games and also returned punts. In 2007, he played in 13 games serving as holder in each of the contests and made six receptions for 38 yards and Rams’ 2007 recipient of the Ed Block Courage Award. In 2008 Looker played 13 games with 6 starts and made 23 receptions for 271 yards, and 11.8-yard average and 2 touchdowns. The head coach of the Rams during 2006, 2007, and 2008 seasons was Scott Linehan, for whom Looker had previously played at the University of Washington. Looker's contract with the Rams expired at the end of the 2008 season making him a free agent. =Detroit Lions= The Detroit Lions signed Looker on August 17, 2009 after the team waived wide receiver Bobby Sippio. Scott Linehan was by then the Lions offensive coordinator. In three preseason games, Looker made 6 receptions for 65 yards. However Looker was released a few weeks later on September 5, 2009. Political career Initially Looker was planning to run for the Puyallup, Washington School Board but \\"decided to suspend his campaign believing a seat in the state legislature will put him in a better position to improve our local schools.\\" Looker intended to run on a Republican ticket. Following the primary election, in which Looker qualified for the General Election for the Puyallup School Board position, he re-entered the race for the School Board seat. He won the General Election and was installed as a member of the Puyallup School Board on December 12, 2011. Personal life Looker has a wife, Amy Clancy Looker, who is a teacher at Kalles Junior High and head coach of the Rogers High School girls' basketball team. They have four children, including a son named Tate born in July 2011,and a daughter named Shae, born in October 2004 and live in the Summit-Waller community of Tacoma, Washington.

He served as Bishop of Fall River from 1907 until his death in 1934. Biography Daniel Feehan was born in Athol, Massachusetts, to William and Joanna (née Foley) Feehan. As a young child he moved with his parents to Millbury, where he attended the local public schools and befriended the future President William Howard Taft. He completed his classical and philosophical studies at St. Mary's College in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1876. He then studied theology at St. Joseph's Seminary in Troy, New York, for three years. Feehan was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Francis McNeirny on December 29, 1879. His first assignment was as a curate at St. Bernard's Church in Fitchburg, where he remained for seven years. He then served as pastor of St. Luke's Church in West Boylston (1886–89). In 1889, he returned to St. Bernard's Church and served as permanent rector there until 1907. On July 2, 1907, Feehan was appointed the second Bishop of Fall River by Pope Pius X. He received his episcopal consecration on the following September 19 from Bishop Thomas Beaven, with Bishops Matthew Harkins and Michael Tierney serving as co- consecrators. During his 27-year tenure, he became known as the \\"Benevolent Bishop\\" and established thirty-six parishes. Feehan later died at age 78.

Midkiff, 467 U.S. 229 (1984), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court held that a state could use eminent domain to take land that was overwhelmingly concentrated in the hands of private landowners and redistribute it to the wider population of private residents.Hawaii Housing Auth. v. Midkiff, .  Background  Only 22 landowners owned 72.5% of the fee simple titles in the island of Oahu, and the Hawaii State Legislature concluded that there was an oligopoly in land ownership that was \\"skewing the State's residential fee simple market, inflating land prices, and injuring the public tranquility and welfare.\\" However, the shortage of buildable land on Oahu was largely because roughly half of the island is government-owned and thus unavailable for privately- owned housing. The Hawaii legislature enacted a condemnation scheme, which was intended to transfer titles to the lots from its owner, the Bishop Estate, to the home lessees. The case focused on the taking of land held by the Bishop Estate, a charitable trust that held the residual lands of the Hawaiian monarchy, and used the proceeds to support the Kamehameha schools, which provide an education to Hawaiian children. The Bishop Estate had subdivided some of its land on Oahu and leased individual lots to land lessees, who built homes on them and at first paid nominal rents to the estate. However, as Oahu land values rose, as did rents, the tenants demanded the state to acquire the Estate's title and to reconvey title to the individual lots to the lessee- homeowners, who would have to pay fair market value to reimburse the state for the acquisition.  Decision  The Court's decision looked to Berman v. Parker (1954) in which eminent domain power had been used to redevelop slum areas and for the possible sale or lease of the condemned lands for private interest. The Court decided that the United States Congress had the power to determine what was for the public good over the judiciary. The decision equated police power with the eminent domain of the sovereign's public use requirement. In an 8-0 decision, the Court voted that the Hawaiian act was constitutional. Hawaii's act to regulate the oligopoly was seen as a classic exercise of the State's police powers, and a comprehensive and rational approach to identifying and correcting market failure and satisfied the public use doctrine. Land did not have to be put into actual public use in order to use eminent domain. It is the taking's purpose, and not its mechanics that were important. Here, eminent domain was used to provide an overall market benefit to the wider populace. The decision suggested that a judicial deference to the legislature was involved. If the legislature determines there are substantial reasons for the exercise of the taking power, courts must defer to the legislature's determination that the taking will serve a public use. The Court held that the takings to correct concentrated property ownership was a legitimate public purpose. = Limitations of the decision = The decision, though, placed limits on the power of the government, stating:  Aftermath  However, the aftermath of the Midkiff decision failed to achieve the stated purpose of the redistribution legislation. It could not create new housing because it transferred title from the land lessor only to the lessee-homeowners who already occupied existing homes on the subject property. As soon as the former lessees acquired fee simple titles to their homes, they became attractive to Japanese investors who paid high prices for those homes, largely in the upscale Kahala and Hawaii Kai neighborhoods. That led to a ripple effect throughout the island. Home prices on Oahu, far from falling, as had been intended by the legislature, surged upward and more than doubled within six years. The primary holding of Midkiff was reaffirmed by Kelo v. City of New London (2005).

Located in Anuak Zone, at the confluence of the Baro River and its tributary the Jajjabe, the city has a latitude and longitude of and an elevation of 526 meters. It is surrounded by Gambela Zuria. Gambela is important because bridges over both the Baro and the Jajjaba are located in that city. The Anuak and Nuer inhabitants of Gambela each have their own market. The town also boasts an airport (ICAO code HAGM, IATA GMB) and is near the Gambela National Park.  History  Gambela was founded because of its location on the Baro, a tributary of the Nile, which was seen by both the British and Ethiopia as an excellent highway for exporting coffee and other goods from the fertile Ethiopian Highlands to Sudan and Egypt. = British Concession (1902-1956) = Emperor Menelik II of Ethiopia granted Britain use of a port along the Baro May 15, 1902, and in 1907 the port and a customs station were founded at Gambela. A shipping service run by Sudan Railways linked Khartoum with Gambela, a distance of 1,366 kilometers. According to Richard Pankhurst, by the mid-1930s boats sailed twice a month during the rainy season, taking seven days downstream and eleven upstream.Richard Pankhurst, An Economic History of Ethiopia (Addis Ababa: Haile Selassie University Press, 1968), p. 304 According to Bahru Zewde, British interest in the concession was due, in part, to the attraction of ' tapping the allegedly fabulous commercial potential of Western Ethiopia and drawing the whole region into the economic orbit of the Sudan ', but also intended ' to be a brilliant British countermove to avert the virtual commercial hegemony in Ethiopia that the Jibouti-Addis Ababa Railway seemed to promise the French. ' In fact it benefitted the Abyssinians themselves not to have their economy at the control of a single European power, whether French or British or even Italian, and Menelik was playing a wise game of playing his colonial neighbours against each other, to avoid any single one gaining a monopoly, whilst opening his country to the benefits of trade and technology, as part of a major programme of modernisation. Although over 70% of Ethiopia's external trade passed through the port at Djibouti between 1911 and 1917, the share of goods passing through Gambela had the fastest rate of growth until the Italian conquest. The British did have to cope with the Ethiopian governors of Sayo and Gore, who showed a keen interest in the money to be made in the cross-border trade.Bahru Zewde, \\"An Overview and Assessment of Gambella Trade (1904-1935)\\", International Journal of African Historical Studies, 20 (1987), pp. 75-94 A small detachment of troops from the nominal condominium of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan was posted to Gambela to maintain order and security within the concession and defend it from outside interests in what was still a largely lawless country, following numerous Egyptian, Islamist, British and Italian interventions, and a consequent breakdown of civil authority, over the previous decades. The Regent Ras Tafari (the later Emperor Haile Selassie), beginning on 9 July 1927, granted a number of concessions to T. Zervos and A. Danalis to construct a road 180 kilometers in length to connect Gambela with the towns of Metu and Gore.Pankhurst, Economic History, pp. 290f The British Concession was not directly affected by the Italian invasion of Ethiopia in 1935 but when Italian East Africa was formally established in 1936, the Ethiopian concession was deemed to have lapsed. The shipping service suspended and the steamer, together with the British resident, left Gambela on 14 October. With the river traffic now gone, the Italians provided an alternative link for the town, by building a further road from Gambela, this one to Nekemte, between 1936 and 1940. Gambela was taken from the Italians by the 2/6 King's African Rifles on 3 February 1941.\\"Local History in Ethiopia\\" The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 29 January 2008) The property of the British buildings were reported to have been respected and left intact during the peacetime and wartime Italian administration. The original Resident returned, but the Concession was no longer distinctive, as the whole country remained under British administration, the Occupied Enemy Territory Administration (OETA), for a number of years, until sufficient Ethiopian administrators had been trained. Lij Tewodros, a son of Lij Iyasu, surfaced in the Gambela area in May 1941 proclaiming himself Emperor. His insurrection was put down by Belgian Congo troops before they left the area in February 1942. A new Anglo-Ethiopian treaty was signed on 19 December 1944 which virtually eliminated British privileges, but the Gambela enclave continued. The Ethiopian government gradually increased its control over the enclave: outlawing the Maria Theresa Thaler as legal tender, requiring all merchants to obtain passports in person in Addis Ababa, and in 1951 informing the British resident, Captain Dribble, that he could no longer judge or imprison anyone. When he departed on 30 October 1954, the end of the enclave was in sight. The enclave was still held by the Sudanese when they achieved independence, but they did not agree to hand the enclave back to Ethiopia until 15 October 1956. = Recent history = The port was closed during the Derg era, and it remains closed due to tension between the Sudan People's Liberation Army and the Ethiopian government, though there are hopes to reopen the port. The Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front announced on 27 May 1991 that they had gained control of Gambela. On 13 December 2003, in an apparent reprisal for a series of ambushes of highlander civilians, 30 Ethiopian soldiers and highlander civilians launched a brutal attack on Gambela's Anuak population. Human Rights Watch has estimated that 424 people were killed.Human Rights' Watch website An armed Anuak group (which John Young speculates is the Gambela People's Liberation Movement) attacked a prison in the capital 30 October 2005, freeing inmates, and killing the police commissioner.Young, Armed Groups along Sudan's Eastern Frontier: An overview and analysis (Geneva: Small Arms Survey, Graduate Institute of International Studies, 2007), p. 41 In March 2012, a bus was attacked, with 19 people on board being shot dead.  Demographics  Based on the 2007 Census conducted by the Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia, Gambela has a total population of 39,022, an increase of 113.67% over the 1994 census, of whom 20,790 are men and 18,232 women. A total of 10,152 households were counted in this town, which results in an average of 3.8 persons to a household, and 9,595 housing units. The majority of the inhabitants said they were Protestant, with 57.04% of the population reporting they observed this belief, while 30.39% of the population practised Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, 9% were Muslim, and 4.08% were Catholic.Census 2007 Tables: Gambela Region , Tables 2.1, 2.4, 2.5, and 3.4.

The band was composed of Jason Decay (vocals / bass), Brandon Wars (guitar) and Steel Rider (drums). Decay, Wars, and Rider had all been in and out of bands on the local scene before forming Goat Horn. What began as a jam of Cathedral and Judas Priest covers quickly developed into a serious project. Their music was influenced by ground-breaking metal bands such as Venom, Raven, Eudoxis (Canadian thrash metal pioneers), and Celtic Frost. With the release of their 2001 debut, Voyage To Nowhere, Goat Horn became the main focus and priority of each member's musical endeavors. This album was recorded in a one-day session in February 2001. In September 2001, they relocated to Toronto in order to gain more exposure. The majority of 2002 was spent touring Ontario, Quebec and the northern United States. In December 2002 the band re- entered the studio to prepare their second release. In June 2003, Storming The Gates was released. The band's last album was entitled Threatening Force, and it was released in 2005. Goat Horn disbanded in June 2006. Since its break-up, Jason Decay has continued his heavy metal vision with his new band Cauldron, using demos he recorded for Goat Horn's fourth release as the basis of his new band's material.

He probably lived in the 2nd century AD,\\"Alcinous fits most comfortably into a period bounded by the writings of Plutarch on the one hand, and Galen and Alexander of Aphrodisias on the other, with Apuleius, Albinus, Atticus, Numenius, the Peripatetic Aspasius, ... and Maximus of Tyre as approximate contemporaries.\\" John Dillon, 1993, Alcinous, The Handbook of Platonism, page xiii. Oxford. although nothing is known about his life. He is the author of The Handbook of Platonism, an epitome of Middle Platonism intended as a manual for teachers. He has, at times, been identified by some scholars with the 2nd century Middle Platonist Albinus. Writings Alcinous is the author of work called The Handbook of Platonism (, also ; ), one of the few surviving works from the Middle Platonist period (c. 90 BC - 250 AD). The book contains 36 chapters which cover topics ranging from logic to physics to ethics. It is thought to have been intended as a manual, not for students of Platonism, but for its teachers. The treatise is written in the esoteric manner typical of the Corpus Aristotelicum, and it often appropriates popular concepts from other philosophical schools — in particular the Peripatetic and Stoic schools — which could be seen as having been prefigured in the works of Plato. Alcinous's handbook has been dated to the middle of the 2nd century AD. In 1879 the German scholar Jacob Freudenthal argued that Alcinous was really the philosopher Albinus, the teacher of Galen the physician. This theory remained largely unchallenged until 1974, when John Whittaker made a fresh case convincingly reaffirming Alcinous's authenticity.John Whittaker, (1974), Parisinus Graecus 1962 and the Writings of Albinus, Phoenix 28, 320-54, 450-56. Alcinous held the world and its animating soul to be eternal.Alcinous, Handbook, 14.3. This soul of the universe was not created by God, but, to use the image of Alcinous, it was awakened by him as from a profound sleep, and turned towards himself, \\"that it might look out upon intellectual things and receive forms and ideas from the divine mind.\\" It was the first of a succession of intermediate beings between God and man.Alcinous, Handbook, 14.6-7, 15.1. The idea proceeded immediately from the mind of God, and were the highest object of our intellect; the \\"form\\" of matter, the types of sensible things, having a real being in themselves.Alcinous, Handbook, 9.1. He differed from the earlier Platonists in confining the ideas to general laws: it seemed an unworthy notion that God could conceive an idea of things artificial or unnatural, or of individuals or particulars, or of any thing relative.Alcinous, Handbook, 9.2. He seems to have aimed at harmonizing the views of Plato and Aristotle on the ideas, as he distinguished them from the eidos, forms of things, which he allowed were inseparable: a view which seems necessarily connected with the doctrine of the eternity and self-existence of matter.Alcinous, Handbook, 9.3. God, the first fountain of the ideas, could not be known as he is: it is but a faint notion of him we obtain from negations and analogies: his nature is equally beyond our power of expression or conception.Alcinous, Handbook, 10.4-6. Below him are a series of beings (daimones)Alcinous, Handbook, 15.1. who superintend the production of all living things, and hold intercourse with men. The human soul passes through various transmigrations, thus connecting the series with the lower classes of being, until it is finally purified and rendered acceptable to God.Alcinous, Handbook, 16.1-2. His system is understood as a synthesis of Plato and Aristotle, with some elements borrowed from the East, and perhaps derived from a study of the Pythagorean system, which experienced a revival of sorts concomitant to that which produced Middle Platonism.

The facility opened in 2005 and houses the Art Gallery of Newfoundland and Labrador, the Provincial Archives of Newfoundland and Labrador and the Provincial Museum of Newfoundland and Labrador. The facility was constructed on a hill overlooking the port city, at a historic location once occupied by Fort Townshend. The building can be seen from almost any point in St. John's, and the facility has, since its construction, competed with its neighbour, the Basilica of St. John the Baptist, for the dominance of the St. John's skyline.  History  = Origins of the name = The building's name, as well as its architecture, is a reference to the simple gable-roofed sheds (called \\"fishing rooms\\") that were once so common at the waterline in Newfoundland fishing villages. =Fort Townshend= Signal Hill During the planning and construction of the building much opposition was raised by archaeologists and historians because of its location. Previously on the same strategic spot of land was located Fort Townshend, an 18th-century military fort, that was eventually buried under ground. The great star-shaped citadel, one of the largest British fortifications in North America at the time, was built to defend Britain's fishing interests. With the withdrawal of the imperial garrison in 1870, the site became the home of the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary and, later, the St. John's Fire Department. The site was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1951. On-site interpretation allows visitors to explore this historic past. Careful research and documentation before construction ensured that future study of the site is possible.

One also says that X is finite over Y. In fact, f is finite if and only if for every open affine open subscheme V = Spec B in Y, the inverse image of V in X is affine, of the form Spec A, with A a finitely generated B-module.. For example, for any field k, \\\\text{Spec}(k[t,x]/(x^n-t)) \\\\to \\\\text{Spec}(k[t]) is a finite morphism since k[t,x]/(x^n-t) \\\\cong k[t]\\\\oplus k[t]\\\\cdot x \\\\oplus\\\\cdots \\\\oplus k[t]\\\\cdot x^{n-1} as k[t]-modules. Geometrically, this is obviously finite since this is a ramified n-sheeted cover of the affine line which degenerates at the origin. By contrast, the inclusion of A1 − 0 into A1 is not finite. (Indeed, the Laurent polynomial ring k[y, y−1] is not finitely generated as a module over k[y].) This restricts our geometric intuition to surjective families with finite fibers.  Properties of finite morphisms  * The composition of two finite morphisms is finite. * Any base change of a finite morphism f: X → Y is finite. That is, if g: Z → Y is any morphism of schemes, then the resulting morphism X ×Y Z → Z is finite. This corresponds to the following algebraic statement: if A and C are (commutative) B-algebras, and A is finitely generated as a B-module, then the tensor product A ⊗B C is finitely generated as a C-module. Indeed, the generators can be taken to be the elements ai ⊗ 1, where ai are the given generators of A as a B-module. * Closed immersions are finite, as they are locally given by A → A/I, where I is the ideal corresponding to the closed subscheme. * Finite morphisms are closed, hence (because of their stability under base change) proper.. This follows from the going up theorem of Cohen- Seidenberg in commutative algebra. * Finite morphisms have finite fibers (that is, they are quasi-finite).. This follows from the fact that for a field k, every finite k-algebra is an Artinian ring. A related statement is that for a finite surjective morphism f: X → Y, X and Y have the same dimension. * By Deligne, a morphism of schemes is finite if and only if it is proper and quasi-finite.Grothendieck, EGA IV, Part 4, Corollaire 18.12.4. This had been shown by Grothendieck if the morphism f: X → Y is locally of finite presentation, which follows from the other assumptions if Y is Noetherian.Grothendieck, EGA IV, Part 3, Théorème 8.11.1. * Finite morphisms are both projective and affine..  Morphisms of finite type  For a homomorphism A → B of commutative rings, B is called an A-algebra of finite type if B is a finitely generated as an A-algebra. It is much stronger for B to be a finite A-algebra, which means that B is finitely generated as an A-module. For example, for any commutative ring A and natural number n, the polynomial ring A[x1, ..., xn] is an A-algebra of finite type, but it is not a finite A-algebra unless A = 0 or n = 0. Another example of a finite-type morphism which is not finite is \\\\mathbb{C}[t] \\\\to \\\\mathbb{C}[t][x,y]/(y^2 - x^3 - t). The analogous notion in terms of schemes is: a morphism f: X → Y of schemes is of finite type if Y has a covering by affine open subschemes Vi = Spec Ai such that f−1(Vi) has a finite covering by affine open subschemes Uij = Spec Bij with Bij an Ai-algebra of finite type. One also says that X is of finite type over Y. For example, for any natural number n and field k, affine n-space and projective n-space over k are of finite type over k (that is, over Spec k), while they are not finite over k unless n = 0. More generally, any quasi-projective scheme over k is of finite type over k. The Noether normalization lemma says, in geometric terms, that every affine scheme X of finite type over a field k has a finite surjective morphism to affine space An over k, where n is the dimension of X. Likewise, every projective scheme X over a field has a finite surjective morphism to projective space Pn, where n is the dimension of X.

Early life Maria Josepha Louise Philippina Elisabeth Pia Angelica Margaret was the daughter of the future King George of Saxony (1832–1904) and Infanta Maria Anna of Portugal (1843–1884). Marriage On 2 October 1886 at age nineteen, she married Archduke Otto Franz of Austria, \\"der Schöne\\" (the handsome), younger brother of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand who would later be killed in Sarajevo. A pious woman, only her strength of religion enabled her to bear the burdens of marriage to the notoriously womanizing \\"gorgeous Archduke\\". His frequent absences from his family helped her goal of keeping her children away from his bad influence succeed. Eventually, however, she herself entered into a relationship with the actor Otto Tressler, who had been presented to her by the emperor Franz Joseph, who felt sorry for her because of the adultery of her spouse. Maria Josepha often invited Tressler to her home; he sometimes met her husband and his friends in the doorway. When her husband died, her ability to avoid extravagant displays of grief was much admired. As a widow, she ended her relationship with Tressler, probably because of her sense of what was appropriate behaviour for a widow. leftDuring World War I she nursed the wounded in the Augarten Palace of Vienna, which had been converted into a hospital.

The War Manpower Commission was a World War II agency of the United States Government charged with planning to balance the labor needs of agriculture, industry and the armed forces.  History  The Commission was created by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in Executive Order 9139 of April 18, 1942. Its chairman was Paul V. McNutt, head of the Federal Security Agency. In this Executive Order, the War Manpower Commission was headed by the Federal Security Administrator as Chairman, and consisted of representatives from the Department of War, the Department of the Navy, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Labor, the War Production Board, the Labor Production Division of the War Production Board, the Selective Service System, and the United States Civil Service Commission to ensure effective mobilization of manpower in the post-war era. Executive Order 9279, dated December 5, 1942, transferred the Selective Service System to the War Manpower Commission. However, a year later it was made a separate agency directly responsible to the President. McNutt appointed all men to his labor advisory committee, despite the pleas of Women's Bureau director, Mary Anderson, to have women represented. Instead, he created a Women's Advisory Committee appointing thirteen prominent women professionals, business executives, journalists, educators and organizational presidents.

Originally named Hirmata, the city owed its importance in the 19th century to being located on the caravan route between Shewa and the Kingdom of Kaffa, as well as being only six miles from the palace of the king of Jimma. According to Donald Levine, in the early 19th century the market attracted thousands of people from neighboring regions: \\"Amhara from Gojjam and Shoa, Oromo from all the Gibe Kingdoms and numerous representatives of the Lacustrine and Omotic groups, including Timbaro, Qabena, Kefa, Janjero, Welamo, Konta and several others\\".Donald N. Levine, Greater Ethiopia, second edition (Chicago: University Press, 1974) The present town was developed on the Awetu River by the Italian colonial regime in the 1930s.

Jimma was the scene of a violent encounter which started in April 1975 between radical college students (known as zemacha) sent to organize local peasants, who had benefited from land reform, and local police, who had sided with local landowners. Students and peasant followers had imprisoned local small landowners, rich peasants and members of the local police force; this action led to further unrest, causing the Derg (the ruling junta) to send a special delegation to Jimma, which sided with the local police. In the end, 24 students were killed, more arrested, and the local zemacha camps closed.Marina and David Ottaway, Ethiopia: Empire in Revolution (New York: Africana, 1978), p. 73f Days before the end of the Ethiopian Civil War in May 1991, the city was captured by the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front.

It also was a top producer of nectar sugar in a 2016 study in Britain, with a second-place ranking due to a production per floral unit of (2609 +/- 239 μg). Alternative names A number of other names are used in other areas or have been used in the past, including: Canadian thistle, lettuce from hell thistle, California thistle,Californian Thistle (Cirsium arvense), Landcare Research, New Zealand corn thistle, cursed thistle, field thistle, green thistle, hard thistle, perennial thistle, prickly thistle, small-flowered thistle, way thistle and stinger-needles. Canada and Canadian thistle are in wide use in the United States, despite being a misleading designation (it is not of Canadian origin).Invasive and Problem Plants of the United States: Cirsium arvense Description Flowering creeping thistle Cirsium arvense is a C3 carbon fixation plant. The C3 plants originated during Mesozoic and Paleozoic eras, and tend to thrive in areas where sunlight intensity is moderate, temperatures are moderate, and ground water is plentiful. plants lose 97% of the water taken up through their roots to transpiration. Creeping thistle is a herbaceous perennial plant growing up to 150 cm, forming extensive clonal colonies from thickened roots that send up numerous erect shoots during the growing season. It is a ruderal species.p80 GIven its adaptive nature, Cirsium arvense is one of the worst invasive weeds worldwide. Through comparison of its genetic expressions, the plant evolves differently with respects to where it has established itself. Differences can be seen in their R-protein mediated defenses, sensitivities to abiotic stresses and developmental timing. = Taxonomy = The Canada thistle is part of the Cirsium genus, in the subtribe Carduinae, trube Cardueae and family Astreracae. It differs from other species in the same genus given its dioecious flowers. It it also different from other native North American species given its large roots and multiple small flower heads on a branched stem =Underground network= Its underground structure consists of four types, 1) long, thick, horizontal roots, 2) long, thick, vertical roots, 3) short, fine shoots, and 4) vertical, underground stems. Though asserted in some literature, creeping thistle does not form rhizomes. Root buds form adventitiously on the thickened roots of creeping thistle, and give rise to new shoots. Shoots can also arise from the lateral buds on the underground portion of regular shoots, particularly if the shoots are cut off through mowing or when stem segments are buried. =Shoots and leaves= Stems are 30–150 cm, slender green, and freely branched, smooth and glabrous (having no trichomes or glaucousness), mostly without spiny wings. Leaves are alternate on the stem with their base sessile and clasping or shortly decurrent. The leaves are very spiny, lobed, and up to 15–20 cm long and 2–3 cm broad (smaller on the upper part of the flower stem). = Flower head fragrance = Every plant species has a unique floral fragrance composition. the fragrance that C. arvense emits attracts both pollinators and florivores containing compounds that attract each respectively. Nonnative honeybees are shown to have the highest visitation rate, following other bee species such as halictus and lasioglossum. Hover flies are also commonly seen pollinating the flower heads of this plant. Florivores such as Beetles and Grasshoppers are commonly seen as well. The compounds found in the fragrance may not be in the highest abundance but they are highly attractive. P-anisaldehyde is found in less than 1%, yet it attracts pollinators such as honey bees. This is thought to be the result of additive and synergistic effects from the blend increasing the attraction to the plant. After pollination, it can be seen that fragrance emission decreases in C.arvense. This is regulated through a regulatory feedback mechanism depending on the pollination status of the plant. This mechanism has only been observed in pistillate plants for dioecious C. arvense. Fragrance emission increases with age. The fragrance contains several compounds that attract diverse insects. Looking at certain butterflies species, it can be seen that the fragrance blend is highly attractive to them, being sensitive to their antennae. High antennal response are seen in consequence to the phenylacetaldehyde as well as the terpenes (oxoisophoroneoxide, oxoisophorone, and dihydrooxoisophorone) found in the blend. This was seen in both natural plants emitting the fragrance and emitting the scent synthetically. It is believed that general arousal can be stimulated through exposure of a single compound, whereas the accumulated exposure of all the compounds influence the foraging behaviour of the butterflies. =Flowers and seeds= The inflorescence compound cyme is in diameter, pink-purple, with all the florets of similar form (no division into disc and ray florets). The flowers are usually dioecious, but not invariably so, with some plants bearing hermaphrodite flowers. The seeds are 4–5 mm long, with a feathery pappus which assists in wind dispersal.Flora of Northwest Europe: Cirsium arvense Blamey, M. & Grey-Wilson, C. (1989). Flora of Britain and Northern Europe. Kay, Q. O. N. (1985). Hermaphrodites and subhermaphrodites in a reputedly dioecious plant, Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop. New Phytol. 100: 457-472. Available online (pdf file). One to 5 flower heads occur per branch, with plants in very favourable conditions producing up to 100 heads per shoot. Each head contains an average of 100 florets. Average seed production per plant has been estimated at 1530. More seeds are produced when male and female plants are closer together, as flowers are primarily insect-pollinated. The plant can bloom from seed in a year then subsequently the seeds produced can emerge in the following year. Varieties Variation in leaf characters (texture, vestiture, segmentation, spininess) is the basis for determining creeping thistle varieties. According to Flora of Northwest Europe the two varieties are: *Cirsium arvense var. arvense. Most of Europe. Leaves hairless or thinly hairy beneath. *Cirsium arvense var. incanum (Fisch.) Ledeb. Southern Europe. Leaves thickly hairy beneath. The Biology of Canadian Weeds: Cirsium arvense list four varieties: *Cirsium arvense var. vestitum (Wimm. & Grab). Leaves gray-tomentose below. *Cirsium arvense var. integrifolium (Wimm. & Grab). Leaves all entire or the upper leaves entire and the lower stem leaves shallowly and regularly pinnatifid or undulating. *Cirsium arvense var. arvense. Leaves shallowly to deeply pinnatifid, often asymmetrical. *Cirsium arvense var. horridum (Wimm. & Grab). Leaves thick, subcoriaceous, surface wavy, marginal spines long and stout. Ecology A European goldfinch (Carduelis carduelis) feeding on the seeds The seeds are an important food for the goldfinch and the linnet, and to a lesser extent for other finches.Cramp, S., & Perrins, C. M. (1994). The Birds of the Western Palearctic. Vol. VIII: Crows to Finches. Oxford University Press, Oxford. Creeping thistle foliage is used as a food by over 20 species of Lepidoptera, including the painted lady butterfly and the engrailed moth, and several species of aphids.Finnish Lepidoptera Cirsium arvenseThe Ecology of Commanster: Cirsium arvense Ecological Flora of the British Isles: Phytophagous Insects for Cirsium arvense The flowers are visited by a wide variety of insects such as bees, moths, wasps and beetles (the generalised pollination syndrome). Status as a weed The species is widely considered a weed even where it is native, for example being designated an \\"injurious weed\\" in the United Kingdom under the Weeds Act 1959.DEFRA: Identification of injurious weeds It is also a serious invasive species in many additional regions where it has been introduced, usually accidentally as a contaminant in cereal crop seeds. It is cited as a noxious weed in several countries; for example Australia, Brazil, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United States. Many countries regulate this plant, or its parts (i.e., seed) as a contaminant of other imported products such as grains for consumption or seeds for propagation. In Canada, C. arvense is classified as a primary noxious weed seed in the Weed Seeds Order 2005 which applies to Canada's Seeds Regulations.Weed Seeds Order 2005 , Canada Gazette Part I, Vol. 139, No. 9 Control =Organic= Control methods include cutting at flower stem extension before the flower buds open to prevent seed spread. Repeated cutting at the same growth stage over several years may \\"wear down\\" the plant. Growing forages such as alfalfa can help control the species as a weed by frequently cutting the alfalfa to add nutrients to the soil, the weeds also get cut, and have a harder time re-establishing themselves, which reduces the shoot density. Orellia ruficauda feeds on Canada thistle and has been reported to be the most effective biological control agent for that plant.Moore 1975, Maw 1976 Its larvae parasitize the seed heads, feeding solely upon fertile seed heads.Lalonde The weevil Larinus planus also feeds on the thistle and has been used as a control agent in Canada. One larva of the species can consume up to 95% of seeds in a particular flower bud. However, use of this weevil has had a damaging effect on other thistle species as well, include some that are threatened. It may therefore not be a desirable control agent. It is unclear if the government continues to use this weevil to control Canada thistles or not. The rust species Puccinia obtegens has shown some promise for controlling Canada thistle, but it must be used in conjunction with other control measures to be effective.Turner et al. 1980. Also Puccinia punctiformis is used in North America and New Zealand in biological control.R. C. French, A. R. Lightfield: Induction of Systemic Aecial Infection in Canada Thistle (Cirsium arvense) by Teliospores of Puccinia punctiformis. In: Phytopathology. Band 80, Nr. 8, 1990, S. 872–877, DOI:10.1094/Phyto-80-872 In 2013, in four countries in three continents, epidemics of systemic disease caused by this rust fungus could be routinely and easily established.Berner, D. K., et al. (2013) Successful establishment of epiphytotics of Puccinia punctiformis for biological control of Cirsium arvense. Biological Control 67:350-360. The procedure for establishing this control agent involves three simple steps and is a long-term sustainable control solution that is free and does not involve herbicides. Plants systemically diseased with the rust gradually but surely die. Reductions in thistle density were estimated, in 10 sites in the U.S., Greece, and Russia, to average 43%, 64%, and 81% by 18, 30, and 42 months, respectively, after a single application of spores of the fungus.Berner, D. K., et al. (2015) Asymptomatic systemic disease of Canada thistle (Cirsium arvense) caused by Puccinia punctiformis and changes in shoot density following inoculation. Biological Control 86:28-35. Electron scan micrography of Aceria anthocoptes Aceria anthocoptes feeds on this species and is considered to be a good potential biological control agent. =Chemical= Applying herbicide: Herbicides dominated by phenoxy compounds (especially MCPA) caused drastic declines in thistle infestation in Sweden in the 1950s.Weeds and weed management on arable land: an ecological approach Sigurd Håkansson CABI Publishing Series, 2003, MCPA and clopyralid are approved in some regions. Glyphosate is a non-selective herbicide that can be used when the plant has grown a few inches tall, where the herbicide can be absorbed by the leaf surfaces. Crop tolerance and weed control ratings were conducted in the spring of 2012, and the Prepass herbicide by DOW AgroSciences was found to be most effective at controlling the species as a weed problem in alfalfa fields. Uses Like other Cirsium species, the roots are edible, though rarely used, not in the least because of their propensity to induce flatulence in some people. The taproot is considered the most nutritious part. The leaves are also edible, though the spines make their preparation for food too tedious to be worthwhile. The stalks, however, are also edible and more easily despined.Plants for a Future: Cirsium arvense Bruichladdich distillery on Isle of Islay lists creeping thistle as one of the 22 botanical forages used in their gin, The Botanist. The feathery pappus is also used by the Cherokee to fletch blowgun darts. References External links *Tiley, G.E.D. \\"Biological Flora of the British Isles: Cirsium arvense (L.)

They are commonly called earth-boring dung beetles. Most excavate burrows in which to lay their eggs. They are typically detritivores, provisioning their nests with leaf litter (often moldy), but are occasionally coprophagous, similar to dung beetles. The eggs are laid in or upon the provision mass and buried, and the developing larvae feed upon the provisions. The burrows of some species can exceed 2 metres in depth. A few species communicate by stridulation (rubbing body parts together to make sounds). Classification They were originally classified as the subfamily Geotrupinae in the family Scarabaeidae before being elevated to a family. Traditionally the dor beetle family Bolboceratidae was included (as the subfamily Bolboceratinae) on the basis of the number of antenna segments, but examination of a different set of characteristics prompted Scholtz & Browne (1995) to elevate Bolboceratidae to a family, a result supported by recent phylogenetic research.MCKENNA, D.

Early life Gould was born in Wyken, Coventry, Warwickshire on 12 June 1946. He is the son of Henry Gould and Helen McKellar Gould (née Morton). He spent his youth living in Wyken and attended Caludon Castle School for his secondary education. Playing career Gould started his football career at Coventry City, making his debut for the club whilst still an apprentice at the age of 16. He did not sign professional until June 1964. A striker, he scored 40 goals in 82 league games for the Sky Blues, helping them to win the Second Division title in 1966–67. He moved to Arsenal in February 1968 for £90,000. He could not hold down a regular place in the Arsenal first team, although he did score a headed goal in the 1969 League Cup Final against Swindon Town, to send the game into extra time; Arsenal went on to lose 3–1. Gould played no part in Arsenal's European Fairs Cup 1969–70 final win and by the end of 1969–70 was on the sidelines at Arsenal. He made two appearances and scored a goal earlier in the cup run against Glentoran. In June 1970 Gould was transferred to Wolves for a fee of £55,000, and made his debut against Newcastle United in August 1970, but after just 15 months he was signed by West Bromwich Albion manager Don Howe for £66,666. He made his Albion debut at home to Ipswich Town in the same month, and partnering Jeff Astle in attack, went on to score 12 goals in his first season at the Hawthorns. In all he scored 19 goals in 60 appearances for Albion, but when his form began to wane he was sold to Bristol City for £68,888 in December 1972. Gould joined West Ham United in November 1973 for an £80,000 fee, and picked up a winners' medal in the 1975 FA Cup Final as a non-playing substitute. He re-joined Wolves for £30,000 in December 1975 and helped them to win the Second Division title in 1976-77. He moved on to Bristol Rovers for £10,000 in October 1977, assuming the role of player-coach. Between January and April 1978 Gould coached the Norwegian side Aalesunds FK, and joined Hereford United as player-coach for £10,000 in September of the same year. Management and coaching career =Club management (1979–1993)= Gould joined Chelsea as assistant manager to Geoff Hurst in 1979. When Hurst was sacked in April 1981, Gould took charge of first team affairs for the final two games of the season, before leaving the club shortly afterwards. Gould began his managerial career with Bristol Rovers in October 1981 before returning to Coventry City as boss in May 1983. He remained there until he was sacked on 28 December 1984. The highlight of this spell at Coventry came on 10 December 1983 when his unfancied Coventry side achieved a 4–0 win over Liverpool, the top English club side of the time who went on to win the league title, League Cup and European Cup that season. He made a swift return to management after accepting an offer to return to Bristol Rovers. Gould is most famous for his achievements with Wimbledon. He moved to the South Londoners in the summer of 1987 after their first season as a First Division club, in which they had finished sixth. His first season brought one of the most famous FA Cup victories in history, when his unfancied Wimbledon side beat Liverpool to clinch the 1988 FA Cup Final at Wembley. They also finished seventh in the league. Gould is famous for adopting the technique of, as he says, \\"goal keepers who can kick the ball 90 yards and a 6-foot 2 bloke to head it in!\\" he said jokingly on talkSPORT with Andy Goldstein. Gould remained with the Dons for two more seasons before quitting to make way for his assistant Ray Harford. In December 1990, Gould returned to football as assistant manager to Don Howe at Queen's Park Rangers – a role reversal of the management team that they had formed at Wimbledon. Gould lasted just two months at Loftus Road before accepting an offer to become manager of West Bromwich Albion. But he was unable to prevent them from suffering relegation to the old Third Division at the end of the 1990–91 season – the first time that Albion had slipped to such depths. In 1991–92, Albion just missed out on the playoffs in their first season as a Third Division club and Gould left in June 1992 to join Coventry, his former club. Ironically, Howe was working at Coventry by this time and the pair were joint managers, but Howe stepped down before the season began to leave Gould in sole charge. He remained at Coventry City until October 1993, when he resigned despite defying all the odds and keeping them clear of relegation from the Premiership. In his first season, they had been fourth in the league as late as January before a late season dip in form saw them finish 15th. Earlier in the season he had paid Newcastle United £250,000 for striker Mick Quinn, who was among the top scorers in the first-ever Premier League season with 17 goals. He also oversaw a thrilling 5–1 victory in the league over Liverpool, and the following season they began with a similarly impressive 3–0 win over Arsenal at Highbury. =International management (1995–1999)= His next stop was with the Welsh national team. He became national coach in June 1995 but quit four years later after their failure to qualify for the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Gould was not at all highly regarded by the Welsh fans, following questionable tactics and major fallings out with players such as Nathan Blake, when Blake refused to play after accusing Gould of making a racist remark in training, as well as Mark Hughes. Gould also engaged in a wrestling bout with John Hartson. A comical incident occurred early in the career of Robbie Savage when Savage jokingly threw a replica of Paolo Maldini's shirt away on Sky Sports before a match against Italy. Gould initially dropped Savage from the squad for disrespecting Maldini, only to reinstate him the next day. Gould's final match was a 4–0 defeat to Italy in which he allegedly instructed Mark Hughes \\"not to tackle the Italians as they'll only dive\\". =Back to club football (2000–2003)= In August 2000, Bobby Gould was named as manager of Division Three side Cardiff City. But two months later he handed over his duties to Alan Cork and was promoted to the role of general manager. After seeing the Bluebirds win promotion at the end of 2000–01 he left Ninian Park to seek a return to management. Bobby Gould's final full-time managerial post came in February 2003 when he took over at Division Two strugglers Cheltenham Town. Despite his efforts, Cheltenham were unable to avoid relegation back to Division Three and Gould resigned soon after the 2003–04 campaign was underway, following a run of six defeats in seven games. Gould was unpopular with the fans throughout the start of 2003–04, resulting in a demonstration after the home match with Rochdale during which he came out to announce that he had resigned. =Other roles in football (since 2004)= In season 2004–05 Gould was employed to coach Peterborough United by owner Barry Fry but quit at half time during an LDV Trophy match with Bristol City after a disagreement with Fry over player selection. In September 2006 it was announced that Gould would be employed in assisting his son Jonathan who is head coach with Hawke's Bay United in New Zealand and now coaches the under 15's squad during the summer. Gould appears periodically on BBC Five Live's Fighting Talk in which he has become most notorious for his dislike of being in the final or \\"Defend the Indefensible\\". He is a regular presenter and pundit on talkSPORT Radio, and appears each Friday on the Andy Goldstein Sports Bar programme, where he is colloquially known as \\"The Gouldfather\\". =Return to club football= Gould was appointed as manager of Weymouth in the Conference National on 12 April 2009 for the final five games of the season. In his first game in charge Gould led Weymouth to a 1–1 draw with Forest Green Rovers which ended an 11-game losing streak, but he was unable to save them from relegation to the Conference South. He is now assistant manager at Western League side Portishead Town. Personal life Married to Marjorie since 1968, the couple have two sons Jonathan (born 1968) and Richard (born 1970). Richard Gould is the current Chief Executive of Surrey County Cricket Club and Jonathan Gould is a former Coventry City and Celtic goalkeeper. Matt Gould, Bobby's grandson, is the current first-choice goalkeeper for Spennymoor Town.

Here's how it looked in the Kingsport Times-News (Kingsport, Tennessee). Clockwise from top left: Mindy Carson, Jimmy Durante, Tallulah Bankhead, Fred Allen and Ethel Merman The Big Show, an American radio variety program featuring 90 minutes of comic, stage, screen and music talent, was aimed at keeping American radio in its classic era alive and well against the rapidly growing television tide. For a good portion of its two-year run (November 5, 1950 – April 20, 1952), the show's quality made its ambition seem plausible. Personalities Hosted by stage actress Tallulah Bankhead, The Big Show began November 5, 1950, on NBC with a stellar line-up of guests: Fred Allen, Mindy Carson, Jimmy Durante, José Ferrer, Portland Hoffa, Frankie Laine, Russell Knight, Paul Lukas, Ethel Merman, Danny Thomas and Meredith Willson. To make sure no one missed the launch, NBC ran in Sunday newspapers across the country an illustrated advertisement displaying headshots of Allen, Bankhead, Carson, Durante and Merman. The premiere opened with this introduction: :Tallulah Bankhead: This is radio, 1950. The greatest stars of our time on one big program. And the most fabulous part about this, darlings, is that every Sunday we will present other stars of the same magnitude. Uh, pardon me if I sound like a name dropper, but, uh, let's look into three or four of the names we've lined up for next week's show: Groucho Marx, Fanny Brice, Jane Powell and Ezio Pinnnn- za! (Laughter) Well, now, don't just sit there with your mouths open, darlings. I know what you're thinking: you think such a radio show every week is impossible. And I'm sure that, after you hear our first broadcast, you're going to say that show was impossible. (Laughter) Oh, no, that doesn't sound quite right, does it? (Laughter) But NBC says nothing is impossible. All it takes is courage, vision, and a king-sized bundle of dough. Each week, there will be comedy, drama, music, all performed by the biggest stars of the time. Of course, darlings, now and then a clinker may sneak in, but we're going to try-- :Jimmy Durante: Just a minute, just a minute. I heard that last remark and I resemble it! As she promised, on the second week's program, the guests were Groucho Marx, Jane Powell, Ezio Pinza and Fanny Brice, along with Hanley Stafford, Frank Lovejoy, David Brian and John Agar (the latter three recreating their screen roles in highlights from their current Warner Bros. picture, Breakthrough). The early shows were successful, and the program stayed on Sunday nights from 6:00-7:30pm ET for its first season, shifting to 6:30-8:00pm ET in its second. NBC went full-throttle in an attempt to keep radio from its predicted death, and The Big Show was thought to be a key to that effort. Newsweek stated it was \\"the biggest bang to hit radio since TV started.\\" As if to prove big bang and big bucks were mutual partners, some $100,000 could be budgeted for a single installment. The show's success was credited to Bankhead's notorious wit and ad-libbing ability in addition to the show's superior scripting. She had one of the funniest writers in the business on her staff: Goodman Ace, the mastermind of radio's legendary Easy Aces. She included renowned ad-libbers in the show--particularly Fred Allen (he and his longtime sidekick and wife, Portland Hoffa, appeared so often they could have been the show's regular co-hosts) and Groucho Marx, both of whom appeared on the first season's finale and appeared jointly on three other installments. As Bankhead recorded in her memoirs, she took the show because she needed the money but nearly changed her mind when she feared she'd be little more than a glorified mistress of ceremonies with nothing to do but introduce the feature performers. \\"Guess what happened?\\" she continued. \\"Your heroine emerged from the fracas as the Queen of the Kilocycles. Authorities cried out that Tallulah had redeemed radio. In shepherding my charges through The Big Show, said the critics, I had snatched radio out of the grave. The autopsy was delayed.\\" Top talent David Stone Martin's illustration was used by NBC to promote Fanny Brice's \\"Baby Snooks\\" character. She was a guest on the second installment of The Big Show (November 12, 1950). The show opened each week with Bankhead quietly trumpeting the high profile of each show's guests. Those guests would then introduce themselves in alphabetical order before Bankhead finished with her own unmistakable rasp, \\"And my name, darlings, is Tallulah Bankhead.\\" The show's lineup, including Allen and Marx, was a literal \\"who's who\\" of American entertainment of the time. They included film stars Ethel Barrymore, Charles Boyer, Gary Cooper, Marlene Dietrich, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Carmen Miranda, Bob Hope, Sam Levene, Martin and Lewis, Ginger Rogers, George Sanders, and Gloria Swanson; musical/comedy stage stars Eddie Cantor, Jimmy Durante, Judy Holliday and Gordon MacRae; opera stars Lauritz Melchior and Robert Merrill; and, jazz and popular music titans Andrews Sisters, Louis Armstrong, Rosemary Clooney, Perry Como, Billy Eckstine, Ella Fitzgerald, Benny Goodman, The Ink Spots, Frankie Laine, Judy Garland, Édith Piaf, Frank Sinatra, Rudy Vallée and Sarah Vaughan. The show also featured many of the nation's most familiar radio stars, some of whom were beginning to shine on the medium the show was intended to help hold at bay: Gertrude Berg (The Goldbergs), Milton Berle, Bob Cummings, Joan Davis, Ed Gardner (Archie from Duffy's Tavern), Phil Harris, Garry Moore, Jan Murray, Ozzie and Harriet Nelson (The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet), Phil Silvers, Danny Thomas, Paul Winchell and more. Other shows in the radio universe were referenced. The Big Show's November 26, 1950, installment, for example, took the cast of Bankhead, Fred Allen, Jack Carson, Melchior and Ed Wynn to the fictitious Duffy's Tavern, where Ed Gardner, in character as Archie the manager, awaited them. Fred Allen, who frequently joked about his own radio demise, joined Bankhead in recreating one of the best-remembered routines from Allen's old show: the \\"Mr. and Mrs. Breakfast Show\\" routine that ruthlessly satirized the often saccharine husband-and-wife morning shows that became something of a radio staple a decade earlier. And it was on The Big Show's premiere that Allen delivered his famous wisecrack about TV: \\"Television is a new medium, and I have discovered why it's called a new medium --- because nothing is well done.\\" \\"The Big Show was not just more grand than most radio shows---it was also more witty, smoothly produced, smart, and ambitious, with an interesting juxtaposition of guests, but it wasn't significantly different,\\" wrote radio historian Gerald Nachman in Raised on Radio. \\"It was just a more lavish, inflated revival of radio's earliest form---the variety showcase; you could almost hear the sequins.\\" Yet Nachman admired the show, which he said was \\"as close to a Broadway show as radio could whip together each week.\\" Finale Except for special tributes (the series premiere, coinciding with the anniversary of George M. Cohan's death, was a particularly slam-bang tribute: a medley of Cohan musicals' signature songs), the show usually concluded with each guest taking a turn singing a line from music director Meredith Willson's composition \\"May the Good Lord Bless and Keep You\\", a touch which proved sentimental but not saccharine. So did Bankhead's likewise customary sign-off, wishing \\"Godspeed\\" to American armed forces around the world (who also listened to the program via the Armed Forces Radio Service). In the surviving episodes, including that first-season finale, Bankhead and her guests breeze through the comic banter and music sequences. Bankhead benefited from a first- class musical director in Willson. Ace's staff writers included Frank Wilson (who adapted movie scripts and short stories for the dramatic segments), George Foster, Mort Greene and Selma Diamond. Fred Allen, a longtime friend of Goodman Ace, contributed as well and is considered (at least by historian Nachman) to have been the show's unofficial script doctor. The show's announcers were Ed Herlihy and, when it occasionally originated from Hollywood, Jimmy Wallington. The Big Show wasn't quite big enough to put television in its place and keep it there. NBC cancelled the show after two seasons and a reported loss of $1 million, a major figure in those years. In fact, it was primarily because the program was unable to attract more advertisers than those who sustained the second half-hour segment (6:30-7:00pm) during the first season: RCA Victor, American Home Products/Whitehall Pharmacal's Anacin, and Liggett & Myers' Chesterfield cigarettes. The show's failure to pull the audience needed to keep it alive longer than two years might also have been due to the former NBC hits now nestling on rival CBS, including The Jack Benny Program (directly opposite The Big Show), Amos 'n' Andy and Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy. But The Big Show is remembered as one of the great final stands, at its best, of classic American old-time radio and---for its wit, colorful music and dramatics---as good as broadcast variety programming got on either medium. Television Dee Englebach, producer of The Big Show, attempted to recreate the radio program's success on television with All Star Revue, and Bankhead signed on as one of the rotating hosts, essentially repeating the comedy antics and musical variety of The Big Show in front of cameras, beginning October 11, 1952, with guest line-up that included Groucho Marx, Ethel Barrymore, Ben Grauer, and Meredith Willson. She continued to host that TV series until April 18, 1953. In the spring of 1980, a 90-minute TV series titled The Big Show, premiered on NBC. Nominated for several Emmy Awards, it nevertheless died a quick death after only a few months. Keith Olbermann's first MSNBC news show, which aired from 1997 to 1998, was titled The Big Show with Keith Olbermann. References Sources *Ace, Goodman.

Playing career Francis made his first team debut for Queens Park Rangers against Liverpool in March 1969. He was captain and central midfield player during the 1970s and was a key player in the QPR side which came close to winning their first-ever league title in 1976. He won 12 caps for the England team between 1974 and 1976, and was captain for eight of those matches. His International career was limited by a persistent back injury. He left QPR for Crystal Palace in 1979, although he subsequently returned to QPR for a 2nd spell, before a move to Coventry City. However this was a time when he suffered injury problems. =Later career= In August 1983, he was appointed player-manager of Exeter City although they endured a difficult season. Francis then had further short playing spells at Cardiff City, Swansea City and Portsmouth before a move to Bristol Rovers in 1985 yielded 32 league appearances, where he ended his playing career in 1987. Management career =Bristol Rovers= Following this playing spell he succeeded Bobby Gould as manager of Third Division side Bristol Rovers. In 1990, he guided the Pirates to the Third Division title and thus they won promotion to the Second Division, but a year later he returned to QPR as manager. =Queens Park Rangers= In 1992–93, QPR finished fifth in the inaugural Premier League – the highest placed of all the London teams. They finished ninth in 1993–94 and eighth in 1994–95, but in November 1994, Francis left Loftus Road for Tottenham Hotspur. During his three years in charge at QPR, Francis fielded a side containing some of the most feared players in the top flight. Arguably the finest player at the club during this time was striker Les Ferdinand, who had joined the club from non-league Hayes in 1986 but not established himself in the first team until the season before Francis arrived, when he scored eight goals in 18 First Division games. Francis kept faith in Ferdinand, and was rewarded in 1992–93 when the player hit 20 league goals in one season. Ferdinand remained at QPR until his £6million transfer to Newcastle in 1995, by which time he had scored 78 goals in five league campaigns and was one of the most feared strikers in England, being capped for the first time in 1993. In July 1997, while manager of Tottenham Hotspur, Francis signed Ferdinand for £6million. With the resignation of Graham Taylor as England national football team manager in November 1993 following failure to qualify for the World Cup, Francis was one of the many names linked to the vacancy, but the job went to Terry Venables instead. In March 1994, ambitious Division One club Wolverhampton Wanderers made a lucrative approach for Francis to drop down a division and take charge of the club looking to make the breakthrough to the Premier League, but he rejected the offer and Wolves turned to Graham Taylor instead. =Tottenham Hotspur= 1994–95 was a 'nearly' season for Tottenham. They finished seventh in the Premier League – two places off a UEFA Cup place – and lost to Everton in the semi finals of the FA Cup. Mid table finishes in the next two seasons were unconvincing and Francis resigned in November 1997 with Spurs battling against relegation from the Premier League. During his time at Tottenham Francis became resented by the fans over his handling of star player Darren Anderton. It has been argued that Francis is largely responsible for Anderton's recurring injuries, placing him in the team without sufficient time to recover, which resulted in Anderton's appearing in only eight games in the 1995–96 season and 17 games in the 1996–97 season. =Back to QPR= In September 1998, Gerry Francis was named as QPR manager for the second time. They had slumped since his departure four years earlier and were now Division One strugglers. He kept them clear of relegation over the next two seasons before finally resigning in February 2001 with a return to the lower half of the league imminent after more than 30 years. He briefly became Director of Football at QPR before beginning his second spell as manager of Bristol Rovers in June 2001. =Bristol Rovers again= Three successive wins at the start of the 2001–02 campaign gave the Pirates hope for promotion back to Division Two, but injuries soon took their toll on the side's form and Francis resigned just before Christmas. The Pirates continued to slide and missed out on relegation to the Conference by just one place. Gerry Francis worked with Graham Muxworthy and Ian Holloway whilst at Bristol Rovers. Francis has not been in management since. =Stoke City= On 4 October 2008, he was offered a position of first team coach at Newcastle United, however due to the uncertainty over the period of the role he decided to take up an offer from Stoke City to become their first team coach. He left Stoke at the end of the 2012–13 season. =Crystal Palace= Francis followed former Stoke manager Tony Pulis to Crystal Palace when he became a coach under Pulis at the London club.Stoke City: Gerry Francis banging drum for sons and Tony Pulis Following Pulis's surprise departure from the club in August 2014 Francis remained in his position in order to assist caretaker manager Keith Millen.Gerry Francis expresses disappointment at Tony Pulis' departure from Crystal Palace However, on 28 August 2014, following the appointment of Neil Warnock as manager it was announced by the club that Francis had left.  Personal life  Francis was a Brentford supporter as a youth and his father Roy was a professional at the club in the late 1940s and early 1950s. His sons Adam and Jake were academy players at Queens Park Rangers.

He began his career in the late 1970s. Beasant's former clubs include Edgware Town, Wimbledon, Newcastle United, Chelsea, Southampton, Nottingham Forest, Portsmouth, Tottenham Hotspur, Brighton & Hove Albion and Wigan Athletic. He played in Wimbledon's 1988 FA Cup victory, during which he became the first goalkeeper to save a penalty in an FA Cup final and the first goalkeeper since 1875 to lift the cup as captain of the winning team. He made two appearances for the England national football team. On 10 May 2015, Beasant became the oldest individual to be selected in the squad for a match in Football League history while representing Stevenage as a substitute against Southend in the League Two Play-Off semi-final second leg, at the age of 56. Football career =Wimbledon= Beasant entered the Football League in 1979 at the age of 20 when Wimbledon, newly promoted to the Third Division, signed him from his local non-league club Edgware Town. He made his debut for Wimbledon against Blackpool on 12 January 1980 and played once again that season, in which Wimbledon were relegated. He became a regular first team player the following campaign, when they were promoted, and he stayed loyal to the club even when they were relegated again in 1982, being a key player in the side that then won the Fourth Division title in 1983, won promotion from the Third Division a year later, and completed a four-season rise to the First Division in 1986 when they gained promotion from the Second Division in only their ninth season as a Football League team. After their promotion in 1986, Wimbledon rose to the top of the First Division in early September before finishing sixth at the end of the 1986–87 season. He became the first goalkeeper to save a penalty in an FA Cup final when he blocked John Aldridge's spot-kick for Liverpool in 1988, and in doing so helped Wimbledon secure a 1–0 win. He was also the first ever goalkeeper to captain his team in an FA Cup final. His ability to kick the ball some considerable distance fitted in well with the \\"long ball\\" style of play Wimbledon were known for in the 1980s, nor was he afraid to move out of the area and upfield before kicking the ball, or to take free kicks. =Newcastle United= However, the 1988 FA Cup final was the last game that Beasant played for Wimbledon. A month later he was sold to Newcastle United for £850,000. =Chelsea= Beasant's spell on Tyneside was brief as the Magpies struggled and were finally relegated from the First Division in bottom place. Beasant had left in January 1989 to join Chelsea. He immediately became first choice keeper, replacing Roger Freestone. In September 1992, two mistakes in a match against Norwich City led to Chelsea manager Ian Porterfield telling the media that Beasant would never play for the club again, although in fact he returned to the side when Porterfield was sacked later that season. During the 1993–94 season Beasant sustained an unusual injury when, while making a sandwich in his kitchen, he dropped a 2 kg glass bottle of salad cream on his foot,http://www.smh.com.au/sport/smith-hamstring-beasant-jar-on-toe- top-10-bizarre-sporting-injuries-20110404-1cyq0.html severing the tendon to his big toe. As a result, he missed eight weeks of the season.https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/may/15/football-freak- injuries-broadfoot-egg Following the arrival of new manager, Glenn Hoddle, who opted for Dmitri Kharine as his first choice keeper with Kevin Hitchcock in reserve, Beasant was unable to get back into the Chelsea squad and looked for a new club. =Southampton= Beasant signed for Southampton in November 1993 for a fee of £300,000 to replace the recently departed Tim Flowers. Beasant made his debut in a 1–0 defeat at Everton on 4 December; despite a run of four defeats, his confidence gradually returned, and he soon became a favourite with The Dell crowd. With the departure of Ian Branfoot and his replacement as manager by Alan Ball, the \\"Saints\\" eventually climbed out of the relegation zone, finishing the 1993–94 season one point above relegated Sheffield United. At the start of the 1994–95 season, he was replaced by Bruce Grobbelaar but was restored as first-choice keeper for the last month of the season. Following Alan Ball's move to Manchester City in the summer of 1995, new manager Dave Merrington preferred Beasant in goal. The team struggled throughout the season, and were never far from the relegation zone, but finished level on points but with a better goal difference than Ball's Manchester City who were relegated. Beasant himself finished the season by being voted the club's Player of the Season. For the 1996–97 season, Graeme Souness was appointed manager; initially, Souness kept faith with Beasant but after a series of injuries (during which Saints took Chris Woods on loan), Souness signed Maik Taylor from Barnet in January. Beasant's final first-team game for Southampton was a 1–0 defeat against Liverpool on 29 December 1996. Following the arrival of Paul Jones in the summer of 1997, Beasant was now only third-choice 'keeper, and after a loan move to Nottingham Forest in August 1997, the transfer was made permanent in November. In his four years at The Dell, he made a total of 105 appearances in all competitions. =Later career= In November 1997, he signed for Nottingham Forest at 38 years old, after a short period on loan. He spent four years at the City Ground, during which time they were relegated from the Premier League one season after promotion. He went on to become Forest's oldest ever player at 42. He then signed for Portsmouth in August 2001 after their regular goalkeeper Aaron Flahavan was killed in a car crash. In November 2001 Beasant terminated his contract at Portsmouth and signed for Tottenham Hotspur on a two-month contract. He played his last competitive game in the 2002–03 season for Brighton & Hove Albion in Division One at the age of 43, although he did spend the 2003–04 season registered as a player with Fulham in the FA Premier League. By then he was the oldest player registered with any professional club and the last in England with a 1950s birthdate. He came out of retirement on 17 August 2013 to play for Southern League Division One Central club North Greenford United in a 2–0 defeat against Chalfont St Peter. Having joined Stevenage as the club's goalkeeping coach in the middle of 2014, Beasant was named as a substitute for an away match at Carlisle United on 11 October 2014, aged 55. International career Beasant was selected to play two full international matches for England by manager Bobby Robson. The first of Beasant's two England caps came at Wembley Stadium on 15 November 1989 against Italy in a friendly match, where he replaced Peter Shilton as a half-time substitute and kept a clean sheet in a 0–0 draw. The following month on 13 December, also at Wembley, he made his second appearance in a friendly against Yugoslavia, again as a half-time substitute in a 2–1 win for England. He was a member of England's 1990 FIFA World Cup squad, having been called up after David Seaman had to withdraw through injury. Coaching career By the time of his retirement, Beasant had been appointed as a goalkeeping coach at Fulham in addition to serving as goalkeeping coach for Northern Ireland under former Wimbledon teammate Lawrie Sanchez. Beasant resigned from the Northern Ireland post in 2007 after Sanchez was appointed Fulham manager only for the pair to both be sacked by the club in December 2007. Beasant was a senior coach at the Glenn Hoddle Academy. He joined in 2008 and worked not only with the Academy's goalkeepers, but also outfield players, especially defenders. In August 2012, Beasant was appointed part-time goalkeeper coach at Bristol Rovers. In July 2014, he became goalkeeping coach at Stevenage where he joined his son Sam Beasant. On 25 June 2015, he was appointed as goalkeeping coach at Reading. On 22 December 2018, Beasant was released after the club appointed Jose Gomes to replace Paul Clement as manager.

He has been referred to as \\"a thinker of considerable originality and one of the greatest philosophers, naturalists, and neuroscientists of all time.\\" His work in biology has been described as remarkable, and his originality made him likely a pioneer. Because of difficulties dating Alcmaeon's birth, his importance has been neglected. Biography Alcmaeon was born in Croton and was the son of Peirithous. Alcmaeon is said by some to have been a pupil of Pythagoras, and he is believed to have been born c. 510 BC.\\"There is disagreement about the date of his birth: Aristotle says that \\"Alcmaeon of Croton lived when Pythagoras was old,\\" [Metaphysics, 1, v, 30, 986a] but it would appear that the passage is interpolated. Diogenes Laertius states that he was a disciple of Pythagoras, [viii. 83] and this could have been possible if we assume that the latter died about 490 and that Alcmaeon was born about 510 BC.\\" Plinio Prioreschi, (1996), A History of Medicine: Greek medicine, page 167. Although he wrote primarily about medical topics, there is some suggestion that he was a philosopher of science, not a physician. He also practiced astrology and meteorology. Nothing more is known of the events of his life. Work During Alcmaeon's time, the medical school in Magna Graecia was regarded as the most famous; illnesses were studied in a scientific and experimental manner. Alcmaeon was considered by many an early pioneer and advocate of anatomical dissection and was said to be the first to identify Eustachian tubes. His celebrated discoveries in the field of dissection were noted in antiquity, but whether his knowledge in this branch of science was derived from the dissection of animals or of human bodies is disputed.Dict. of Ant., p. 756, a Calcidius, on whose authority the fact rests, merely says \\"qui primus exsectionem aggredi est ausus,\\" and the word exsectio would apply equally well in either case;Calcidius, Comment. in Plat. \\"Tim.\\" p. 368, ed. Fabr. some modern scholars doubt Calcidius' word entirely. Alcmaeon also was the first to dwell on the internal causes of illnesses. It was he who first suggested that health was a state of equilibrium between opposing humors and that illnesses were because of problems in environment, nutrition and lifestyle. A book titled On Nature is attributed to him, though the original title may be different, as Alexandrian writers were known to have ascribed the title \\"On Nature\\" to a wide variety of works. According to Favorinus's account, Alcmaeon has been the first who wrote such a treatise on natural philosophy (),Clement of Alexandria, Stromata i. p. 308 however this has been disputed, because Anaximander wrote before Alcmaeon. Accounts which attribute an Alcmaeon of Croton to be the first to write animal fables,fabulas, Isid. Orig. i. 39 may be a reference to a poet with the same name. He also wrote several other medical and philosophical works, of which nothing but the titles and a few fragments have been preserved by Stobaeus,Stobaeus, Eclog. Phys. Plutarch,Plutarch, De Phys. Philos. Decr. and Galen.Galen, Histor. Philosoph. Surviving fragments attributed to Alcmaeon include, \\"The earth is the mother of plants and the sun their father\\", and may be also, \\"Experience is the beginning of learning\\", attributed to an Spartan poet named Alcman. =Study of the senses= Calcidius' commentary on Plato's Timaeus praises Alcmaeon (as well as Callisthenes and Herophilus), about their work on the nature of the eye. He mentions that Alcmaeon excised an animal eye to study the optic nerve. However, there is no evidence that Alcmaeon himself dissected the eye or the skull. Based on this observation, and more rudimentary, Alcmaeon described the senses, except for the touch sense. These observations contributed to the study of medicine by establishing the connection between the brain and the sense organs, and outlined the paths of the optic nerves as well as stating that the brain is the organ of the mind. Many scholars believe that Plato referred to Alcmaeon's work, when writing in Phaedo about the senses and how we or animals think. He also stated that the eye contains both fire and water, with vision occurring once something is seen and reflected by the gleaming and translucent part of the eye. =Other studies= Alcmaeon said that sleep occurs by the withdrawal of blood, away from the surface of the body, to larger blood-flowing vessels, and that one becomes awake again once the blood returns. And if the blood withdraws entirely, death occurs. It has been suggested that Hippocratic authors, and Aristotle, adopted Alcmaeon’s views on sleep.Albert S. Lyons, M.D., F.A.C.S., R. Joseph Petrucelli, II, M.D., Medicine: An Illustrated History, pp. 187, 192A further account of his philosophical opinions may be found in Gilles Ménage's Notes to Diogenes Laertius, viii. 83, p. 387; Le Clerc, Hist. de la Med.; Alphonsus Ciacconius ap. Fabric. Biblioth. Graec. vol. xiii. p. 48, ed. vet.; Sprengel, Hist. de la Med. vol. i. p. 239; C. G. Kühn, De Philosoph. ante Hippocr. Medicinae Cultor. Lips. 1781, 4to., reprinted in Ackermann's Opusc. ad Histor. Medic. Pertinentia, Norimb. 1797, 8vo., and in Kühn's Opusc. Acad. Med. et Philol. Lips. 1827-8, 2 vols. 8vo.; Isensee, Gesch. der Medicin. There are also accounts of him about embryology, how a child develops, and analogies with animals and plants about human physiology. Because of the little evidence, there exists controversy to what extent Alcmaeon can be considered as a Presocratic cosmologist, or if at all. Pythagorean Although Alcmaeon is often described as a pupil of Pythagoras, there are reasons to doubt whether he was a Pythagorean at all; his name seems to have crept into lists of Pythagoreans given us by later writers.Christian August Brandis, Geschichte der Philosophie vol. i. p. 507-508 Aristotle mentions him as nearly contemporary with Pythagoras, but distinguishes between the stoicheia () of opposites, under which the Pythagoreans included all things;Aristotle, Metaphysics A. 5 and the double principle of Alcmaeon, according to Aristotle, less extended, although he does not explain the precise difference. Since 1950 the scholarly consensus holds that Alcmaeon of Croton is a figure independent of the Pythagoreans. Other doctrines of Alcmaeon have been preserved. He said that the human soul was immortal and partook of the divine nature, because like the heavenly bodies it contained in itself a principle of motion.Aristotle, de Anima, i. 2, p. 405Cicero, De Natura Deorum i. 11 The eclipse of the moon, which was also eternal, he supposed to arise from its shape, which he said was like a boat. All his doctrines which have come down to us relate to physics or medicine; and seem to have arisen partly out of the speculations of the Ionian School, with which rather than the Pythagorean, Aristotle appears to connect Alcmaeon, partly from the traditional lore of the earliest medical science.

It served for 61 years before being retired in 1933, when its function was replaced by a different light. The current lighthouse is at least the second structure at the site. The first lighthouse was built in 1852 of cast iron made at the Baltimore foundry of Murray and Hazlehurst, and was pulled down during the Civil War so that Union warships could not use it as a navigational aid. History Port Bolivar Lighthouse During the Galveston Hurricane of 1900, the lighthouse served as a shelter for at least 125 people, saving their lives. In 1915, the lighthouse also survived another hurricane, where winds of 126 miles per hour were recorded. The first lighthouse keeper, H. C. Claiborne, retired in 1918, after witnessing those two storms, and was replaced by a Captain J. Brooks. From the 1890s until the line's abandonment in 1942, the lighthouse looked down on the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway line that ran between it and Texas State Highway 87. In 1947, the lighthouse was sold and, although still standing, is not open to the public. The 1970 film My Sweet Charlie, starring Patty Duke and Al Freeman Jr. was filmed at the lighthouse and adjacent caretaker's house. The War Department took possession of the lighthouse in 1935. It was transferred to the War Assets Administration, sold to rancher Elmer V. Boyt, and remains in the family.Lighthousefriends.com- Retrieved 2014-12-19 Current After withstanding over 150 years of erosion, the lighthouse is now entirely black.

He is now a television pundit for Fox Sports as well as general manager and technical director for Los Angeles Blues in the American USL Pro league. Club career Born in Stoke Newington, London, Barton began his league career with Maidstone United, after joining from Dagenham who negotiated for three players and a manager, John Still to move the other way. Despite some defensive weaknesses, he gained attention from clubs playing in higher tiers of English football due to his ability to move forward at speed up the flank with the ball and place the ball in the box accurately. During this period, Barton had a 'day job' working in the mailroom at the London offices of accounting firm, Arthur Andersen. =Wimbledon= Barton was transferred to First Division side Wimbledon on 7 June 1990, his £300,000 transfer fee being the largest sum paid for a Fourth Division player at the time. However, Maidstone were sliding into a serious financial crisis at this time and his sale did little to improve matters, although it would be another two years before financial problems finally forced them out of business and cost them their place in the Football League. Barton walked straight into the Wimbledon first team, missing just one league game in the 1990–91 season as they finished seventh. His first game was in the 3–0 defeat at home to Arsenal on the opening day of the season. He remained a regular fixture at right-back for the rest of his time there, despite playing under three different managers; Ray Harford (July 1990 – October 1991), Peter Withe (October 1991 – January 1992) and finally Joe Kinnear. During his time at Wimbledon he was instrumental in keeping them in the Premiership, and quickly became one of the most highly rated defenders in England. However, Barton had the most successful spell of his career with the Dons after they moved him into midfield, where his accurate passing set up many goals for the Crazy Gang's forwards. Wimbledon were widely regarded as the smallest club in the top flight, traditionally having the lowest crowds and the smallest budget to spend on players, but they managed to avoid relegation year after year, more often than not by a comfortable margin, at a time when bigger clubs like Nottingham Forest went down. Barton helped them finish sixth in 1994 – the best finish in their history. =Newcastle United= On 5 June 1995, Barton became the most expensive defender in English football when he moved to Newcastle United for £4 million, joining \\"The Entertainers\\" being assembled by Kevin Keegan. Everything looked rosy for Barton, and a few England caps followed, his classy, comfortable style on the ball earned him a reputation as a true footballing full-back. His attacking role under Keegan however meant he did not always suit the national team and he did not make too many more appearances for England. He made his debut on 19 August 1995, when the Magpies beat Coventry City 3–0 at St James' Park. He played 31 times that season, and by Christmas it was looking certain that he would be collecting a league title medal as the Magpies had a 10-point lead over Manchester United at the top of the Premier League. However, when the Magpies lost 1–0 at home to the Old Trafford side on 4 March 1996, the lead had been cut to a single point and soon afterwards they were overhauled, having to settle for second place in the final table. Over the next two seasons, Barton's first team opportunities were more limited as manager Kevin Keegan and his successor Kenny Dalglish (who took over in January 1997) chose Steve Watson as a right back more frequently.http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football- heroes/displayhero_club.asp?HeroID=38236 However, Watson's move to Aston Villa in October 1998 saw Barton return to the right-back position on a more regular basis under new manager Ruud Gullit, and he was still the club's first choice player in this position in 2000–01, by which time the Magpies were being managed by the former England boss Bobby Robson. Barton finally lost his first team place in the 2001–02 season to Aaron Hughes and this time he was unable to win it back. He made just five league appearances before joining Derby County for a fee of £200,000 on 1 February 2002, ending nearly seven years on Tyneside. =Derby County= Barton was manager John Gregory's first signing for a Derby County side battling against relegation from the Premier League, and played in all of their final 14 league games. At first, things went smoothly enough at Pride Park, with two quick wins following by a point against title chasing Manchester United suggesting that the Rams were on their way to safety. But seven defeats from the final eight games cost them their top flight status after six seasons, and with financial problems putting the club under serious pressure, there was little prospect of a swift return. Derby finished 18th in the 2002–03 Division One campaign, well short of the playoffs even though they were never in any real danger of a second successive relegation. Barton remained the club's first choice right-back, but following Gregory's dismissal in favour of George Burley, Barton did not feature in the first team in the 2003–04 season, finally departing in October when he joined Division Two promotion chasers Queens Park Rangers on a free transfer. =Queens Park Rangers= Barton played just five first team games during his four months at Loftus Road, before returning to Wimbledon on a free transfer on 27 February 2004. The Hoops went on to secure promotion to Division One. =Return to Wimbledon= A lot had changed at Wimbledon Football Club since Barton had last played for them nine years earlier. They had survived in the Premier League for five seasons after his departure, finally going down in 1999–2000. The decision to relocate the club to Milton Keynes was approved in May 2002, after the Dons narrowly missed out on the Division One playoffs for the second season running. In spite of some of the lowest attendances in the league after the majority of the club's fans defected to newly formed AFC Wimbledon (at non-League level), the Dons had managed a respectable 10th-place finish in 2002–03, but then they went into administration and were forced to sell most of their key players. As a result, their fortunes on the pitch suffered and the move to Milton Keynes in September 2003 (initially in the National Hockey Stadium until a new permanent stadium was built) did little to solve matters. By the time Barton arrived at the end of February, the club was still in administration and relegation (if not complete closure) was almost certain. Barton appeared in just five games for the Dons as they went down in bottom place with a massive 33 defeats (one of the worst Football League records ever) and on 17 September 2004 he finally departed from the club, who for the 2004–05 had been re-formed as Milton Keynes Dons to reflect their new location. At the age of 35, Barton's senior career was over. =Dagenham & Redbridge= On leaving Milton Keynes Dons, Barton dropped into non-League football to play for Conference National club Dagenham & Redbridge. He was selected just twice for the \\"Daggers\\", before finally hanging up his boots on 31 May 2005.http://www.soccerbase.com/players_details.sd?playerid=470 International career Barton made his debut for England in the February 1995 friendly away match against the Republic of Ireland which was abandoned after only 27 minutes because of rioting English fans. Known as the Lansdowne Road football riot, the trouble was caused by English neo-Nazi organisation Combat 18. Later that year, he earned his second and third against Sweden and Brazil respectively. In the latter, which proved to be his last international match, he was only a very late substitute coming on for John Scales. Coaching and management Barton ended his playing days where he began, with Dagenham & Redbridge in the 2004–05 season and then coached the side during the week. He also worked for Brighton & Hove Albion part-time on a consultancy basis. In 2008, Barton was named as the U-18 coach for Los Angeles Galaxy of Major League Soccer. He remained in the position until 2010. On 13 January 2010, Barton joined on as a partner and technical adviser for the newly reestablished San Diego Flash soccer club in the National Premier Soccer League. He was later named president and head coach of the club on 19 March 2010.san diego flash Website Barton was named general manager and technical director for Los Angeles Blues of the USL Pro league on 11 December 2012.http://labluesprosoccer.com/la-blues-soccer-club-name-warren-barton-as- new-general-manager-and-technical-director/ Regarding coaching certifications, Barton holds the UEFA Pro License as well as the UEFA 'A' and 'B' Coaching Licenses. Barton currently works as a youth coach and the Technical Director at Del Mar Carmel Valley Sharks, a youth soccer club in San Diego, California. Television Since his retirement in 2005, Barton has worked for Fox Sports 1 as a television pundit. In 2006, Barton was part of ITV4's World Cup team of pundits. He presented his own comedy segment entitled 'Warren Barton Travel Agent' in which he provided a comical breakdown of each country taking part in the World Cup. Barton represented Newcastle United for Sky One's \\"Premier League All Stars\\". The match took place on 26 September 2007 and finished 3–3. In the resulting penalty shootout, Barton missed his penalty to knock Newcastle out of the tournament. Barton is featured in the \\"Legends of the Tyne\\" series of beers from Northumberland brewery, which depicts past Newcastle United players.

T. Whittaker and G. N. Watson, first published by Cambridge University Press in 1902. The first edition was Whittaker's alone, but later editions were co-authored with Watson. History Its first, second, third, and the fourth, last edition were published in 1902, 1915, 1920, and 1927, respectively. Since then, it has continuously been reprinted and is still in print today. The book is notable for being the standard reference and textbook for a generation of Cambridge mathematicians including Littlewood and G. H. Hardy. Mary Cartwright studied it as preparation for her final honours on the advice of fellow student V. C. Morton, later Professor of Mathematics at Aberystwyth University. But its reach was much further than just the Cambridge school; André Weil in his obituary of the French mathematician Jean Delsarte noted that Delsarte always had a copy on his desk. In 1941 the book was included amoung a \\"selected list\\" of mathematical analysis books for use in universities in an article for that purpose published by American Mathematical Monthly. Notable features Some idiosyncratic but interesting problems from an older era of the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos are in the exercises. The book was one of the earliest to use decimal numbering for its sections, an innovation the authors attribute to Giuseppe Peano.  Contents  Below are the contents of the fourth edition: ;Part I. The Process of Analysis ;Part II. The Transcendental Functions Reception =Reviews of the first edition= George Mathews, in a 1903 review article published in The Mathematical Gazette opens by saying the book is \\"sure of a favorable reception\\" because of its \\"attractive account of some of the most valuable and interesting results of recent analysis\\". He notes that Part I deals mainly with infinite series, focusing on power series and Fourier expansions while including the \\"elements of\\" complex integration and the theory of residues. Part II, in contrast, has chapters on the gamma function, Legendre functions, the hypergeometric series, Bessel functions, elliptic functions, and mathematical physics. Arthur Hathaway, in another 1903 review published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, notes that the book centers around complex analysis, but that topics such as infinite series are \\"considered in all their phases\\" along with \\"all those important series and functions\\" developed by mathematicians such as Joseph Fourier, Friedrich Bessel, Joseph-Louis Lagrange, Adrien-Marie Legendre, Pierre-Simon Laplace, Carl Friedrich Gauss, Niels Henrik Abel, and others in their respective studies of \\"practice problems\\". He goes on to say it \\"is a useful book for those who wish to make use of the most advanced developments of mathematical analysis in theoretical investigations of physical and chemical questions.\\" In a third review of the first edition, Maxime Bôcher, in a 1904 review published in the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society notes that the book falls short of the \\"rigor\\" of French, German, and Italian writers, it is a \\"gratifying sign of progress to find in an English book such an attempt at rigorous treatment as is here made\\". He notes that important parts of the book were otherwise non-existent in the English language.

From Powell et al., 2008. Netrins are a class of proteins involved in axon guidance. They are named after the Sanskrit word \\"netr\\", which means \\"one who guides\\". Netrins are genetically conserved across nematode worms, fruit flies, frogs, mice, and humans. Structurally, netrin resembles the extracellular matrix protein laminin. Netrins are chemotropic; a growing axon will either move towards or away from a higher concentration of netrin. Though the detailed mechanism of axon guidance is not fully understood, it is known that netrin attraction is mediated through UNC-40/DCC cell surface receptors and repulsion is mediated through UNC-5 receptors. Netrins also act as growth factors, encouraging cell growth activities in target cells. Mice deficient in netrin fail to form the hippocampal comissure or the corpus callosum. A proposed model for netrin activity in the spinal column of developing human embryos is that netrins are released by the floor plate and then are picked up by receptor proteins embedded in the growth cones of axons belonging to neurons in the developing spinal column. The bodies of these neurons remain stationary while the axons follow a path defined by netrins, eventually connecting to neurons inside the embryonic brain by developing synapses. Research supports that new axons tend to follow previously traced pathways, rather than being guided by netrins or related chemotropic factors. Discovery Netrin was first described in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans in 1990, and named UNC-6, according to standard C. elegans naming protocol. The first mammalian homologue of UNC-6 was discovered in 1994, where it was discovered to be a vital guidance cue for rodent commissural axons in the spinal cord. As of 2009, five mammalian Netrins have been identified. Netrins 1, 3, and 4 are secreted proteins, whereas G1 and G2 are membrane bound proteins tethered by Glycophosphatidylinositol tails. All netrins discovered in invertebrates thus far are secreted. Overview of netrins The netrin family is composed mostly of secreted proteins which serve as bifunctional signals: attracting some neurons while repelling others during the development of the brain. Expressed in the midline of all animals possessing bilateral symmetry, they can act as long or short range signals during neurogenesis. In order to carry out their functions, netrins interact with specific receptors: DCC or UNC-5, depending on whether they are trying to attract or repel neurons, respectively. There is a high degree of conservation in the secondary structure of netrins, which has several domains which are homologous with laminin at the amino terminal end. The C-terminal domain is where most of the variation is found between species and contains different amino acids which allow interaction with specific proteins in extracellular matrix or on cell the surface. The differences in terms of structure and function have led to the identifications of several different types of netrins including netrin-1, netrin-3, and netrins-G. =Key netrins= Netrin-1 is found in the floor plate and neuroepithelial cells of the ventral region of the spinal cord, as well as other locations in the nervous system including the somatic mesoderm, pancreas and cardiac muscle. Its main role is in axonal guidance, neuronal migration and morphogenesis of different branching structures. Mice with mutations in the netrin-1 gene were observed to be lacking in forebrain and spinal cord commissural axons. Netrin-3 is different from other netrins. While expressed during development of the peripheral nervous system in the motor, sensory and sympathetic neurons, it is very limited in the central nervous system. Studies with netrin-3 have noticed a reduced ability to bind with DCC when compared with netrin-1. This suggests that it mainly operates through other receptors. Netrins-G are secreted but remain bound to the extracellular surface of the cell membrane through Glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI). They are expressed predominantly in the central nervous system in places such as the thalamus and mitral cells of the olfactory bulb. They do not bind to DCC or UNC-5 and instead bind to ligand NGL-1, which results in an intracellular transduction cascade. The two versions, netrin-G1 and netrin-G2, are found only in vertebrates. It is believed that they evolved independently of other netrins in order to facilitate the construction of the brain. =Netrin receptors= DCC and UNC-5 proteins mediate netrin-1 responses. The UNC-5 protein is mainly involved in signaling repulsion. DCC, which is implicated in attraction, can also serve as a co-factor in repulsion signaling when far away from the source of netrin-1. DCC is highly expressed in the central nervous system and associated with the basal lamina of epithelial cells. In the absence of netrin-1, these receptors are known to induce apoptosis. Axonal guidance Growth cones that are located at the end of developing axons during embryogenesis are responsible for the elongation of the axon during migration. Elongation occurs in response to both tropic and atropic factors present in the surrounding environment. Netrins are one such tropic factor secreted by axonal target cells that function as a crucial axonal guidance protein in both vertebrate and invertebrate organisms. Studies in multiple organisms including, mice, rats, chicks, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the zebrafish Danio rerio have indicated that secreted netrins are bifunctional, meaning that they can act as either attractants or repellants in directing axonal extension. In addition, many studies have characterized netrins as both short and long range cues, acting in the immediate or distant vicinity of their source cell (the axonal target cell). =Attraction= Studies of central nervous system (CNS) development in chick and rodent models have identified the netrin-1 protein as a particularly important vertebrate axonal guidance cue. Most significantly, it was observed that the specialized cells of the floor plate located at the ventral midline of the embryonic brain secrete netrin-1, which resulted in a protein gradient. This gradient is most concentrated at the ventral midline and becomes increasingly diffuse as you move dorsally. Additional research in netrin deficient mice found that when netrin associates with the Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC) receptor on the axonal growth cone an attractant response is initiated. This was further supported by an observed absence of ventral commissure (i.e. corpus callosum) development in mice lacking either netrin-1 or DCC. Similar results were observed in experiments with the netrin-1 homolog UNC-6 discovered in C. elegans The same early expression and formation of a protein concentration gradient emanating from the ventral midline is observed in epidermal cells of the developing worm. Evidence suggests that this gradient is essential for the long-range function of UNC-6 in guiding the initial circumferential migration of axons to the ventral midline and that the UNC-40 receptor mediates the attractive response. As additional axons reach the midline, the temporal and spatial expression of UNC-6 becomes increasing restricted, indicating that after a more general dorsal-ventral guidance of axons, UNC-6 is further involved in directing axons to more specific locations. Recently, scientists have characterized many of the cellular mechanisms by which netrin-1 binding to DCC motivates axonal attraction through at least three independent signaling pathways. In all three pathways netrin-1 is observed to cause the homodimerization of DCC that begins the chemoattraction cascade. In the first pathway, the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is bound to DCC and both undergo tyrosine phosphorylation upon netrin-1 binding that induces the recruitment and phosphorylation of Src and Fyn, which is hypothesized to lead to an increase in second messengers Rac1 and Cdc42 thereby promoting growth cone extension. In a second possible pathway, phosphatidylinositol transfer protein α (PITP) binds to phosphorylated DCC which induces phospholipase C (PLC) to increase the ratio of cAMP to cGMP. This increase of cAMP relative to cGMP activates L-type Ca2+ channels as well as transient receptor potential channels (TRPC's) causing an influx of extracellular Ca2+. Evidence suggests that this increased calcium is responsible for the activation of Rho GTPases, Cdc42 Rac1 and the nuclear transcription factor NFAT which can all initiate growth cone extension. Additional studies have also shown that netrin-induced signaling between DCC downstream targets NcK, and Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein WASP trigger Rac1 and Cdc42 and subsequently axonal growth. =Repulsion= Both DCC in vertebrates and UNC-40 in C. elegans have been shown to initiate a repulsive rather than attractive response when associated with the netrin receptor Unc5. In the same ventral midline gradient discussed above, netrin-1 acts as a chemorepellant for axons of the trochlear motor neurons, thus directing their growth dorsally (away from the ventral midline). Antibody inhibition of DCC in embryonic Xenopus spinal cord inhibited both attraction and repulsion in vitro. Likewise, multiple defects were observed in C. elegans unc-40 mutants; however, errors in migration patterns were more profoundly affected by mutations in the unc-5 gene, indicating that binding of the netrin-1 homologue UNC-6 to the UNC-5 receptor alone can repel axonal growth. In both vertebrate and invertebrate systems, short range chemorepulsion in which the concentration of netrins is high, seems to primarily occur via the UNC-5 receptor, while long range repulsive effects at more diffuse concentrations require coordination between DCC (UNC-40 in C.elegans) and UNC-5. It is currently hypothesized that long range chemorepulsion involves initiation of the Arachidonic acid pathway upon netrin-1 interaction with the DCC/UNC-5 complex. This pathway increases the intracellular levels of 12-HPETE (12-Hydroperoxy-5, 8, 10, 14-Eicosatetraenoic Acid), which induces cGMP signaling and subsequently causes a decrease in the cAMP/cGMP ratio. Reducing this ratio inhibits calcium conductance through the L-type calcium channels (LCC) and ultimately results in growth cone repulsion though a possible activation of Ras homolog gene family, member A (RhoA). A similar RhoA- mediated mechanism is proposed for short range chemorepulsion whereby netrin-1 binding to UNC-5 homodimers alone induces tyrosine phosphorylation requiring FAK and Src, which as a result activates RhoA. An additional mechanism proposes that binding of the tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 to the netrin-1/UNC-5 complex may also trigger chemorepulsion through RhoA. Glial and mesodermal guidance Many studies have shown that netrin-1, UNC-40, UNC-6, and UNC-5 are involved in the migration of glia during embryogenesis. During the migratory phase in Drosophila melanogaster, embryonic peripheral glia (ePG) express UNC-5. In UNC-5 knockout organisms, ePG either stall while migrating or fail to migrate. UNC-6 signaling in C. elegans, coupled with the UNC-40 receptor on neurons, promotes synaptogenesis and assembles the glial endfeet around the synapse. Functions outside of neuronal guidance Although originally understood to be specifically involved in axonal guidance in the central nervous system, new research has linked netrin to cancer regulation, the development and formation of non-neural tissue, and the detection of cancer and other diseases. =Development and regulation of tissue= Netrin has been discovered to play a key role in the development and mature regulation of tissue outside the nervous system. Some of the non-neural tissues implicated include lung, placental, vasculature, pancreas, muscle and mammary gland tissue. Netrin contributes to tissue morphogenesis by controlling developing cell migration and cell adhesion in different organs. In developing mammary glands, the growing tips of the ductal network consist of two layers made up of luminal epithelial cells and cap cells. The luminal cells secrete netrin 1, which binds to the receptor neogenin (a homologue of DCC) on the cap cells. This allows for adhesion between the two cell layers, which is necessary for the proper morphogenesis of the terminal end buds (TEBs) in the mammary glands. Loss of the gene coding for either netrin 1 or neogenin leads to the improper formation of the (TEBs), suggesting that rather than acting as a guidance molecule as in neuronal systems, netrin 1 serves as an adhesive in mammary tissue. During the morphogenesis of the embryonic lung, epithelial cells express netrin 1 and netrin 4. These netrins surround endoderm buds in the basement membrane, preventing distal tip cells from expressing DCC and UNC5B. This allows for normal development of the lung and halts potentially dangerous over-branching and budding from occurring. In pancreatic development, netrin 1 is expressed in epithelial ductal cells and localizes to the basal membrane. Netrin 1 associates with several elements in the extracellular matrix, including collagen IV, fibronectin, and integral proteins α6β4 and α3β1. These elements in the extracellular matrix are responsible for epithelial cell adhesion and migration, suggesting that netrin 1 is associated with the guidance of epithelial cells in the embryonic pancreas. Netrin has been implicated as a vital molecule for the proliferation of vascular networks. Multiple studies have found different effects of netrin on these branching vessels. The endothelial tip cells in vascular tissue display similar properties to the growth cone found in neuronal tissue. Studies have discovered that these same endothelial tip cells also express UNC5B, which netrin 1 can bind to, inhibiting angiogenesis. In contrast, several studies show that netrin-1 actually promotes blood vessel branching. In conjunction with this research, it has been found that netrin 4 is responsible for growth in the lymphatic vascular system. Overall, these studies show that regulating effects of netrin is dependent on the type of vascular tissue. Recently, netrin has been implicated in angiogenesis in the placenta, making it vital to the survival of the fetus. This finding has implications in the future treatment of vascular disease in the placenta. In adults, netrin has been implicated in the regulation of stem cell movement and inflammation. Netrin 1 has been found to inhibit leukocyte migration to inflamed areas in the body. This provides evidence that the up regulation of netrin protects injured tissue from excess inflammation. Also, the migration of adult neural progenitor cell and adult spinal cord progenitor cells to the spine is netrin 1 dependent. Little is known of the mechanism controlling the inhibition or attraction of these stem cells. =Cancer regulation and disease markers= In various human cancers, it has been shown that netrin becomes over-expressed. It has also been shown that certain receptors become down- regulated in this process. The netrin receptors DCC and UNC5H are responsible for apoptotic regulation. The absence of netrin 1 is responsible for apoptosis, while the presence of netrin 1 leads to an inhibition of the apoptotic pathway. This pathway is unique and independent of the mitochondrial and death receptor pathways that lead to controlled cell death. This has been observed in the human colon epithelium, where higher levels of natural cell death at the upper portion of the villi correlated with a smaller gradient of netrin-1. This linked the role of netrin with tissue death and growth. Tumor suppressor p53 is responsible for the expression of netrin-1, implying that netrin may be the pathway through which p53 regulates the cell cycle. Because netrin is so influential in the regulation of cell death, the gene which codes for netrin (NTN1) is considered to be an oncogene. Because netrin-1 has been found to be upregulated in tumors, recent research has attempted to identify netrin-1 as a biomarker for the onset of cancer in the human body. It was found that netrin can be found at above-normal levels in the blood plasma of patients who are positive for renal, liver, prostate, meningioma of brain, pituitary adenoma, glioblastoma and breast cancer. Continued research on netrin There are still many unanswered questions regarding the netrin family of molecules. It is still uncertain what role vertebrate homologues of UNC-5 play in chemorepulsion. Although much is known about the expression of netrin during development, little is yet known about its regulation in later development in the brain. Netrin knockout mice show that there is much to learn about the many roles of netrin in axonal guidance. Another important line of current research targets netrin as a treatment for various diseases, including cancer, myocardial infarction, and Alzheimer's Disease. In avian and mouse model organisms suffering from neuroblastoma, interfering with the netrin-1 autocrine loop in malignant tumors leads to cell death. This could lead to possible alternative therapies resulting from future trials. Similar treatments regarding the down-regulation of netrin-1 are also being investigated for metastatic breast and colorectal cancers. Recent studies also suggest that netrin is involved in a cardioprotective role by releasing NO gas. In mice, netrin has also been associated with the regulation of (Aβ) peptide, which is responsible for amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease.

Established under the Local Government Act 2000, it was responsible for promoting high ethical standards in local government. It oversaw the nationally imposed Code of Conduct (also now abandoned), which covered elected and co-opted members across a range of local authorities. The board maintained an independent national overview of local investigations into allegations that members' conduct might have fallen short of the required standards. In certain cases the board itself investigated allegations. It could not impose sanctions on members, but if it considered that further action might be necessary, it referred cases to the Adjudication Panel for England or to the relevant authority's own standards committee for determination. Standards committees (no longer compulsory since 2012) could suspend members for up to six months. The Adjudication Panel could disqualify members for up to five years. The Standards Board for England also provided advice, and produced formal guidance, to members and officers on the Code of Conduct. As part of the 2010 UK quango reforms, the board ceased to function on 31 January 2012 and was formally abolished on 31 March 2012. Relevant authorities The Standards Board for England investigated complaints against members of the following types of authority in England. * parish councils * district, city or borough councils * county councils * the City of London Corporation * unitary authorities, including the Council of the Isles of Scilly * fire and rescue authorities * police authorities * passenger transport authorities * national park authorities * the Broads Authority * the Greater London Authority It also worked with police authorities in Wales. Responsibility for ethical standards Primary responsibility for ensuring ethical standards has rested with the local authorities themselves since before the board was created, and remains with them since it was abolished. The chief executive and legal officers of the authority have a duty to advise members on ethical matters. Under the system abolished in 2012 each local authority subject to the Code of Conduct had to appoint a monitoring officer and a local standards committee. The standards committee (which had to be chaired by an independent member) was responsible for receiving allegations and deciding whether any action needed to be taken. Standards for England had the power to direct that a standards committee's assessment and review functions be suspended, and instead undertaken either by Standards for England or by another relevant authority. This generally happened only after a series of attempts to improve performance, either before or after notification from Standards for England, had failed. Code of conduct The 2001 Model Code of Conduct was made compulsory for all relevant authorities. It was later revised, after an extensive consultation process, and a new Model Code came into force on 3 May 2007. Revisions included a relaxing of the definition of \\"personal interest\\" and an extension of the right of members of authorities to speak in relation to matters in which they had a prejudicial interest. Where members had a prejudicial interest in a matter, they were given the same rights as members of the public to speak at meetings where that matter was being discussed, but were not allowed to vote. A member was deemed to have a personal interest in a matter only if it affected them to a greater extent than it affected the majority of the inhabitants of the locality. By the Localism Act 2011, and with effect from 2012, the statutory Model Code was abolished, although all local authorities in England were still required to adopt a code of conduct which was consistent with the seven Nolan Principles of public life; they were not prevented from adopting the former code, after its abolition, on a voluntary basis. Since 2012 authorities have not been required to appoint standards committees, but they retain the power to do so. Criticism The Standards Board for England was the subject of repeated criticism by the magazine Private Eye for allegedly exceeding its powers, investigating preposterous cases and deterring whistleblowers. The Liberal Democrat peer Lord Tyler raised similar concerns in the House of Lords, saying: :“I have seen that happen time and again with large and small authorities – when apparently disreputable actions of a few leading members or officers of a council have been exposed by a whistleblower, but their reaction has been to seek to silence him or her. :“Instead of welcoming transparency and remedial action, there have been persistent attempts to silence such dissent by claiming that their activities brought the council into disrepute. If a council, in whatever way, is disreputable, it deserves to be given that description. It is not the council that is being brought into disrepute by the dissident member but the behaviour of the council itself in whatever way.”Tyler welcomes end to ludicrously trivial investigations at libdems.org In 2013, in the aftermath of the abolition of the Standards Board, both Bob Neill, the local government minister at the time, and Brandon Lewis, his successor, were critical of the former standards regime in a debate in Westminster Hall and explained the reasoning for abolishing it and seeking a \\"light touch\\" approach instead. Westminster Hall debates, 16 January 2013, at Parliament.uk (from column 289WH) Office holders The last Chief Executive of the board was Glenys Stacey. Its chair was Dr Robert Chilton.

He was awarded an honorary doctoral degree. Biography Herbert V. Hake, son of Henry and Louisa Hake, was born August 10, 1903, in Hoyleton, Illinois. His father was a painting contractor and a school board member who had some drawing skills. He nurtured Herb's strong interest in art. In the late 1920s, Herb studied at Central Wesleyan College in Warrenton, Missouri, earning a bachelor's degree in 1928.http://www.library.uni.edu/collections/special- collections/biographical-sketches/herbert-v-hake He worked at various occupations including layout work for World Color Printing in St. Louis, and writing movie reviews for the St. Louis Times. After a year in St. Louis, he returned to his home county, took a teaching certification examination, and taught in a rural school for a year. He then did graduate work at Northwestern University in Illinois and joined the faculty at Central Wesleyan, where he taught 3 years. He then went to graduate school at the University of Missouri and later the University of Iowa, in Iowa City, Iowa where he earned his master's degree in scenic design in 1933. He then taught drama in the high school at Port Arthur, Texas. In the summer of 1936, he landed a job at the University of Missouri in Columbia with the theater department. From 1938 to 1942 he served as technical director, scenic designer and instructor of speech courses at the Iowa State Teachers College, in Cedar Falls, Iowa.http://www.library.uni.edu/collections/special-collections/biographical- sketches/herbert-v-hake He and one other teacher ran the drama department. During World War II, the number of students at the college fell drastically. In 1942, the drama department was cut back by one, and Hake was asked to take over the radio business at the college or lose his job altogether. With very little experience or equipment, and a technical manual in hand, he started his new career. By the late 1950s he was learning television. During Hake's 34 years at the school, now the University of Northern Iowa, the radio and television facilities grew to include an FM radio station, a student-operated campus radio station, open and closed-circuit television programs and thousands of dollars worth of equipment. He retired in 1972 and was inducted into the Iowa Broadcasters Hall of Fame. In his honor, the call letters of one of the university's radio stations was changed to KHKE. Hake directed and hosted several radio and TV programs, Story Hour, Ask the Scientist, Landmarks in Iowa History and History with Herb Hake. He was a 'chalk talker', telling the story while drawing on the chalk board. He wrote articles and books on stagecraft, and authored Iowa Inside Out (1968); Cartoon History of Iowa (1968); Bicentennial Outlines of Cedar Falls (1974), a coloring book; and 101 Stories of Cedar Falls (1977), which is a collection of his Pioneers, Prophets and Professors column which appeared in the Record, the Cedar Falls newspaper, in the early 1970s. Profits from this book aided the Cedar Falls Historical Society in its drive to turn the old ice house into a museum. Hake was president of the society from 1972 to 1974 and served on its board as well as that of the State Historical Society of Iowa. In retirement Hake interviewed long-time residents of Cedar Falls and recorded their thoughts on tape, to be kept for reference at the society. He used print, chalk, electronic journalism and personal appearances to effectively educate the public to appreciate Iowa's heritage. His contributions to the Cedar Falls Historical Society remain treasured. Herbert V. Hake married his wife Monabelle on June 4, 1930, in Fayette, Missouri. They had two daughters, Patty and Priscilla. He died of cancer on March 10, 1980 at the age of 76.

Early life and education The son of Floyd Clement Aldrich and his wife Ann Hanley, Virgil Aldrich earned his Bachelor of Arts degree at Ohio Wesleyan University in 1925. He studied at Oxford University in 1927 and then went on to earn a Diplôme d'Études Supérieures de Philosophie at the Sorbonne in 1928 before completing his Ph.D. at the University of California Berkeley in 1931. He married Louise Hafliger on 3 September 1927 and they had one son, David Virgil Aldrich. Academic career Aldrich's first academic appointment was his appointment as an instructor in philosophy at Rice University in 1931 and Sterling Fellow at Yale University in 1931-32. Promoted to assistant professor, he remained at Rice until 1942, when he was appointed visiting professor at Columbia University from 1942 to 1946. Appointed professor of philosophy at Kenyon College in 1946, he remained there until 1965, serving as visiting professor at Brown University in 1962-63. In 1965, he became professor of philosophy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he remained until his retirement in 1972. On his retirement, he moved to Salt Lake City, Utah, where he became an adjunct professor at the University of Utah. Aldrich served as Director of the Kyoto American Studies Institute in Japan and for short periods was visiting professor at Harvard University, the University of Michigan, and the University of Texas. He served as trustee and president of the American Society of Aesthetics and president of American Philosophical Association. \\"Some Meanings of Vague\\" (1937) In his article \\"Some Meanings of Vague\\",Analysis, Vol. 4, No. 6 (Aug. 1937), pp. 89–95, Published by: Blackwell Publishing on behalf of The Analysis Committee. Aldrich puts forth a series of definitions of vague objects and sensum, and then argues that any empiricist must account for vague sensum every bit as much as clear sensum, without skirting the issue. He takes there to be many kinds of vagueness—importantly, there is vagueness of symbols and vagueness of senses. Here symbols are anything which is used to refer, including verbal words, signs, pictures, and more. Vagueness regarding symbols can be the same as the vagueness which regards the senses. There can, additionally, be vagueness of the practices surrounding the use of the symbol to refer. These, he suggests, should be avoided.

The US nickel coin was favored because of its size, thickness and relative softness. However, the term hobo nickel is generic, as carvings have been made from many different denominations. Due to its low cost and portability, this medium was particularly popular among hobos, hence the name. Early altered coins (1750s–1913) An altered British penny The altering of coins dates to the 18th century or earlier. Beginning in the 1850s, the most common form of coin alteration was the \\"potty coin\\", engraved on United States Seated Liberty coinage (half dime through trade dollar) and modifying Liberty into a figure sitting on a chamber pot. This time period was also the heyday of the love token, which was made by machine-smoothing a coin (usually silver) on one or both sides, then engraving it with initials, monograms, names, scenes, etc., often with an ornate border. Hundreds of thousands of coins were altered in this manner. They were often mounted on pins or incorporated into bracelets and necklaces. The love token fad faded out in the early 20th century; love tokens engraved on buffalo nickels are rare. During this time period, hobo-style coin alteration could be found outside the United States, primarily in Britain, France, and South Africa. The Buffalo nickel Buffalo nickels When the Indian Head nickel, or Buffalo nickel, was introduced in 1913, it became popular among coin engravers. The big Native American head was a radical departure from previous designs and would not be seen on any subsequent coins. The large, thick profile gave the artists a larger template to work on and allowed for finer detail. On earlier coins, the head was much smaller in relation to the size of the coin. For example, on a Lincoln cent, the head covers about one-sixth of the area. On the Buffalo nickel, the Native American's head occupies about five-sixths of the area. Moreover, the nickel is a larger coin. Large heads also adorn the Morgan dollar and the Columbian half dollar commemoratives of 1892-93, but these coins were rarely altered due to their high value. Another factor contributing to the Buffalo nickel's popularity was the subject. Nearly all previous coins had depicted women (Liberty head nickels, Indian head cents, Barber and Morgan silver dollars). A male head has larger, coarser features (nose, chin, brow) that can be altered in many ways. Even the buffalo on the reverse could be changed into another animal or a man with a backpack. Classic old hobo nickels (1913–1940) Many talented coin engravers, as well as newcomers, started creating hobo nickels in 1913, when the Buffalo nickel entered circulation. This accounts for the quality and variety of engraving styles found on carved 1913 nickels. More classic old hobo nickels were made from 1913-dated nickels than any other pre-1930s date. Many artists made hobo nickels in the 1910s and 1920s, with new artists joining in as the years went by. The 1930s saw many talented artists adopting the medium. Bertram Wiegand, known almost exclusively as Bert, began carving nickels in the teens, and his student George Washington Hughes, known as Bo, began carving in the late teens (and up to 1980 when he vanished in 1981American Heritage Hobo Nickels). During this period, Buffalo nickels were the most common nickels in circulation. Later old hobo nickels (1940–1980) The 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s were a transitional period for hobo coin engravers, during which the Buffalo nickel was gradually replaced by the Jefferson nickel. Some veteran nickel carvers such as Bo and Bert continued making hobo nickels in the classic old style. Bo, in fact, did his best work in the early 1950s, when he carved many spectacular cameo portrait hobo nickels. During this 40-year period, many new carvers appeared, and style and subject matter became decidedly modern. Subjects became more ethnically and socially diverse (e.g., a Chinese woman with triangular hat, hippies with long hair and glasses, men wearing floppy hats, etc.). Some of these new artists used new techniques such as power engravers, vibrating tools, and felt marker pens to add color to hair. By the end of the 1970s, most Buffalo nickels had disappeared from circulation, and the majority of engravings were performed on worn coins. Bo, for example, was forced to obtain Buffalo nickels from coin dealers, some of whom commissioned carvings. Modern hobo nickels (since 1980) Many carvers who were active during the 1960s and 1970s continued carving Buffalo nickels into the 1980s. Their coins were altered using punches (dashes, dots, arcs, crescents, stars) and some carving of the profile. The area behind the head is usually rough from dressing with a power tool. They created standard design hobo nickels (derby and beard), as well as many modern subjects, such as occupational busts (fireman, railroad engineer, pizza chef), famous people (Uncle Sam, Albert Einstein), hippies, and others. A major event occurred in the early 1980s, demarcating the transition from \\"old\\" to \\"modern\\" hobo nickels. This was the publication of a series of articles by numismatist Del Romines on the subject of hobo nickels. He soon published the first book on the subject, Hobo Nickels (ASIN B0006R7SFW), in 1982. Both centered on Bo and his carvings. This resulted in some new artists entering the field, most of whom simply copied Bo's nickel artwork from the illustrations in Romines's book. The two major Bo-style copycats were John Dorusa and Frank Brazzell. Together, they produced 20,000 or more modern carved nickels, most of which were copies of Bo's designs. Dorusa even copied Bo's \\"GH\\" signature (for \\"George Hughes\\") on many of this early creations. Pressure from prominent hobo nickel collectors such as Bill Fivaz convinced Dorusa to stop carving \\"GH\\" and put his own initials or name on his works. Dorusa and Brazzell also produced original works, featuring non-traditional subject matter (conquistadors, Dick Tracy, skulls, etc.). The large number of Bo copies led many collectors to label all modern carved nickels as \\"Neo-Bo's\\", a term no longer in use. Other carvers such as \\"Cinco de Arturo\\" (Arturo DelFavero) also appeared in the 1980s and 1990s, introducing more modern subject matter (cartoon characters, witches, and animals). Most nickel carvers of the 1980s to mid-1990s are regarded by collectors as mediocre at best, but circa 1995, Ron Landis, an engraver in Arkansas, began creating superior quality carvings. For about four years, Landis was the only nickel carver creating superior carvings, at the rate of only one to two dozen per year (all signed, numbered, and dated). Many other professional engravers have since begun creating hobo nickels. Landis and \\"Cinco de Arturo\\" are two of four known living artist practicing this craft prior to the year 2000. The others are Sonny Carpenter, and Bill Jameson (Billzach), All four are considered superior carvers, and ground breakers that inspired the current renaissance. Some current prolific carvers are converting from quantity to quality, making fewer pieces of high artistic quality (as the market is flooded with lower quality quickly-made carvings). Modern carvings of superior quality sell for about the same prices as classic old original carvings of equal quality by unknown artists. From the early 1980s to the present, modern lesser-quality carvings could and still can be purchased for as little as $5 to $10 each. Many new collectors found it hard to obtain good- quality old original hobo nickels (as they are so scarce and costly), so they began collecting the readily obtainable and cheap modern works. About 100,000 (and possibly as many as 200,000) classic hobo nickels were created from 1913 to 1980. Modern artists have created (and continue to create) altered nickels in such large quantities that, within the next few years, the number of modern carvings is expected to surpass that of classic old hobo nickels. Most of the 100,000-plus classic old hobo nickels are not yet in the hands of collectors, whereas almost all modern carvings are. Among numismatists, the modern carvings already greatly outnumber the classic old hobo nickels. See also * Trench art References * Stephen P. Alpert.

He was deeply interested in Iowa history, and wrote two books on it, both of which won national recognition from the American Association for State and Local History. In 1983, Sage was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters. Early life Born in Magnolia, Arkansas, to Jesse A. and Mary C. (Livingston) Sage, Sage earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in history at Vanderbilt University in 1922, and was awarded the Master of Arts (1928) and Doctor of Philosophy degrees (1932), both at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Teaching career He taught for three years in high schools at Camden, Arkansas, and Taylorville, Illinois. From 1928 to 1930, he taught history at DePauw University. While on the faculty of DePauw, he met Margaret Pearson, who was teaching music there. They were married on December 30, 1929, in Bedford, Indiana, and had one daughter, Carolyn Sage Robinson. He was preceded in death by both his wife and daughter. Sage taught various courses in European history at the University of Northern Iowa in 1932, but soon developed a strong interest in Iowa history. His first book, published in 1956, was \\"William Boyd Allison: A Study in Practical Politics,\\" which tracked the career of an influential Iowan in the U.S. Senate at the turn of the century. Well received and reviewed, it was followed by another book, \\"A History of Iowa,\\" which was published in 1974 by the Iowa State University Press. This effort also gained favorable response. Each book won national recognition in the form of the Award of Merit from the American Association for State and Local History. He also contributed a large number of reviews and articles in a wide variety of specialties within European and American history. In December 1987, he appeared on a program sponsored by the Illinois State Historical Society. Retirement Sage took what was then mandatory retirement at age 68 in 1967. But the pace of his career never slackened. He continued to offer a course, usually in Iowa history, on campus during the many semesters until 1981, and directed students via correspondence study until 1986. He was honored by his colleagues in the autumn of 1982 for completing fifty years of continuous service. At the ceremony, he was praised for his ability to relate local and state history to the national and international settings. His colleagues and former students planted a maple tree with a plaque, honoring him in 1984. As far as can be determined, he holds the all-time record for continuous service at the University of Northern Iowa (1932–1986). Honorary degree At the University of Northern Iowa Commencement of May 1983, Sage was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters, at which time, the citation lauded him as scholar, teacher, and humanist, who shared with his legion of grateful students all over the nation, an insatiable penchant for pursuing the understanding of history. He was respected and admired as a model teacher-scholar. Personal life In the community, Sage and his wife were well known for their performances in vocal music, among other activities. He was also a President of the Cedar Falls Rotary Club and President of the Cedar Falls Historical Society. During 1977-1981, he served on the Iowa State Historical Board, including a term as its president. Sage was recognized in 1985 for his services and achievements with an award from Governor Terry Branstad. In the spring of 1988, as he prepared for the move to Iowa City, colleagues and friends praised Sage as an urbane gentleman, who even then sought new academic challenges in the form of additional research and writing from the holdings of the State Historical Society. They added, too, that at state and national history meetings, numerous inquiries continued to be directed toward his writings and well being. Sage was engaged in the writing of several projects at the time of his death in 1989, at age 89.

It stands on its pads and is not usually heavy- footed. Ideally, they have an even and graceful gait. Traditionally, the ears are cropped and posted and the tail is docked. However, in some countries, these procedures are now illegal. Dobermanns have markings on the chest, paws/legs, muzzle, above the eyes, and underneath the tail. Dobermanns are known to be intelligent, alert, and tenaciously loyal companions and guard dogs. Personality varies a great deal between each individual but, if taken care of and properly trained, they are generally considered to be loving and devoted companions. The Dobermann is driven, strong, and sometimes stubborn. With a consistent approach, they can be easy to train and will learn very quickly.  Appearance  World breed standards are published by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale, or FCI (World Canine Organisation), on the advice of the IDC (International Dobermann Club), which is the Dobermann breed's governing council and has 36 countries in its member list. To become a world champion, dogs are judged to FCI standards. The AKC has its own standards, as do some other countries, although most still adhere to FCI standards. The breed standard describes the Dobermann as a dog of medium size that is also strong and muscularly built. In order to be eligible to meet these standards, the body of the Dobermann should appear to be almost square. It should also appear elegant and noble. The dog was originally intended as a guard dog, so males typically have a muscular and intimidating appearance. Females are usually thinner, but should not be spindly. The American Kennel Club (AKC) breed standard differs from the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI) standards, with the latter being an often larger and heavier dog. This has led some to argue that Dobermanns and Doberman Pinschers should be considered and evaluated differently. = Size and proportions = Although the breed standards vary among kennel and breed clubs, most follow the standard set by the FCI, which describes the size of male dogs as at the withers; The Kennel Club in the UK quotes as being ideal. The size of female dogs, according to the same standards, is , with being ideal. The Dobermann has a square frame; its length should equal its height to the withers and the length of its head, neck, and legs should be in proportion to its body. The standards for the weight of the Dobermann are also described by the FCI. The ideal dog must be of a sufficient size for an optimal combination of strength, endurance and agility. The ideal weight of male dogs is described as and the ideal weight of female dogs is described to be . = Color = Two different color genes exist in the Dobermann: one for black (B) and one for color dilution (D). There are nine possible combinations of these alleles, which can result in four different color phenotypes: black, blue, red, and fawn (Isabella). The traditional and most common color occurs when both the color and dilution genes have at least one dominant allele (i.e., BBDD, BBDd, BbDD or BbDd) and is commonly referred to as black, black and rust, or black and tan. The red, red rust, or brown coloration occurs when the black gene has two recessive alleles but the dilution gene has at least one dominant allele (i.e., bbDD, bbDd). The blue Dobermann has the color gene with at least one dominant allele and the dilution gene with both recessive alleles (i.e., BBdd or Bbdd). The fawn coloration is the least common, occurring only when both the color and dilution genes have two recessive alleles (i.e., bbdd). Thus, the blue color is a diluted black, and the fawn color is a diluted red. Expression of the color dilution gene is a disorder called Color Dilution Alopecia, a kind of canine follicular dysplasia. Although not life- threatening, these dogs can develop skin problems. In 1976, a \\"white\\" Doberman Pinscher was whelped and was subsequently bred to her son, who was also bred to his litter sisters. This tight inbreeding continued for some time to allow the breeders to \\"fix\\" the mutation. White Dobermanns are a cream color with white markings and blue eyes. Although this is consistent with albinism, the proper characterization of the mutation is currently unknown. The animals are commonly known as tyrosinase-positive albinoids, lacking melanin in oculocutaneous structures. This condition is caused by a partial deletion in the SLC45A2 gene. File:Dobermann Black and Tan \\"Vito\\".jpgTraditional black and tan Dobermann File:Doberman Pinschers black and blue.jpgOne black and one blue Doberman Pinscher File:Doberman blue, purebred CKC.JPGBlue Doberman Pinscher = Tail = The Dobermann's natural tail is fairly long, but individual dogs often have a short tail as a result of docking, a procedure in which the majority of the tail is surgically removed shortly after birth. Natural Dobermann The practice of docking has been around for centuries and is older than the Dobermann as a breed. The historical reason for docking is to ensure that the tail does not get in the way of the dog's work. Docking has always been controversial, however. Docking and cropping (see below) have been written out of the Breed Standard by FCI and IDC, and dogs born after 2016 will not be allowed to participate in FCI or IDC shows without a full tail and natural ears. This is mirrored in most EU and Commonwealth countries. In the UK, dogs with docked tails have been banned from show for a number of years and the practice is now illegal for native born dogs. Veterinary Certificates are required as proof to avoid prosecution on imported animals. It has also been made illegal in many other European countries, as well as Australia. The American Kennel Club standard for Doberman Pinschers includes a tail docked near the 2nd vertebra. Docking is a common practice in the United States, Russia, and Japan (as well as a number of other countries with Dobermann populations), where it remains legal. = Ears = Dobermanns often have their ears cropped, a procedure that is thought to be done for functionality for both the traditional guard duty and effective sound localization. According to the Doberman Pinscher Club of America, ears are \\"normally cropped and carried erect\\". Like tail docking, ear cropping is illegal in many countries and has never been legal in some Commonwealth countries.  Intelligence  A Doberman Pinscher in a dog park in Hod Hasharon, Israel Canine intelligence is an umbrella term that encompasses the faculties involved in a wide range of mental tasks, such as learning, problem-solving, and communication. The Doberman Pinscher has been ranked amongst the most intelligent dog breeds in experimental studies and expert evaluations. Psychologist Stanley Coren ranks the Dobermann as the 5th most intelligent dog in the category of obedience command training, based on the selective surveys answered by experienced trainers (as documented in his book The Intelligence of Dogs). Additionally, in two studies, Hart and Hart (1985) ranked the Doberman Pinscher first in the same category, and Tortora (1980) gave the Dobermann the highest rank in general trainability. Although the methods of evaluation differ, these studies have consistently shown that the Doberman Pinscher, along with the Border Collie, Standard Poodle, German Shepherd, Golden Retriever, and Rottweiler, is one of the most trainable breeds of dog.  Aggression  Although they are considered to be working dogs, Dobermanns are often stereotyped as being ferocious and aggressive. As a personal protection dog, the Dobermann was originally bred for these traits: it had to be large and intimidating, fearless, and willing to defend its owner from attackers (especially other guard dogs), but sufficiently obedient and restrained to do so only on command. These traits served the dog well in its role as a personal defense dog, police dog, or war dog, but were not ideally adapted to a companionship role. The Dobermann's aggression has been toned down by modern breeders over the years, however. Today's Dobermanns are known to have a much more even and good-natured temperament, as well as extreme loyalty, high intelligence, and great trainability. The modern Dobermann is known to be energetic, watchful, fearless, and obedient. Doberman Pinscher puppies They can easily learn to respect and protect their owners and are therefore considered by many to be excellent guard dogs. Given that they are properly socialized from a young age, they are generally sociable toward familiar humans and can also be sociable with other dogs. However, Dobermanns do rank among the more-likely breeds to show aggressive behaviour toward strangers and other dogs, though they are not among the most likely to do so. They are highly unlikely to show aggressive behaviour toward their owners. There is some evidence that Doberman Pinschers in North America have a calmer and more even temperament than their European counterparts because of the breeding strategies employed by American breeders. Because of these differences in breeding strategies, different lines of Doberman Pinschers have developed different traits. Although many contemporary Doberman Pinschers in North America are gentle and friendly to strangers, some lines are bred more true to the original personality standard. The personality of the Doberman Pinscher is known to be unique. There is a great deal of scientific evidence that Doberman Pinschers have a number of stable psychological traits, such as certain personality factors and intelligence. As early as 1965, studies have shown that there are several broad behavioral traits that significantly predict behavior and are genetically determined. Subsequently, there have been numerous scientific attempts to quantify canine personality or temperament by using statistical techniques for assessing personality traits in humans. These studies often vary in terms of the personality factors they focus on and in terms of ranking breeds differently along these dimensions. One such study found that Doberman Pinschers, compared to other breeds, rank high in playfulness, average in curiosity/fearlessness, low on aggressiveness, and low on sociability. Another such study ranked Doberman Pinschers low on reactivity/surgence and high on aggression/disagreeableness and openness/trainability. In addition to the studies of canine personality, there has been some research to determine whether there are breed differences in aggression. In a study published in 2008, aggression was divided into four categories: aggression directed at strangers, owner, strange dogs, and rivalry with other household dogs. This study found that the Doberman Pinscher ranked relatively high on stranger- directed aggression, but extremely low on owner-directed aggression. The Doberman Pinscher ranked as average on dog-directed aggression and dog rivalry. Looking only at bites and attempted bites, Doberman Pinschers rank as far less aggressive towards humans and show less aggression than many breeds without a reputation (e.g., Cocker Spaniel, Dalmatian, and Great Dane). This study concluded that aggression has a genetic basis, that the Dobermann shows a distinctive pattern of aggression depending on the situation and that contemporary Doberman Pinschers are not an aggressive breed overall. In regards to Dobermanns attacking owners, it is rare and usually in the case of overdiscipline. Dobermanns accept physical punishment to an extent. However, when they consider it to no longer be punishment, but an attack on themselves, they will defend themselves. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, between 1979 and 1998, the Doberman Pinscher was involved in attacks on humans resulting in fatalities less frequently than several other dog breeds such as German Shepherd Dogs, Rottweilers, Husky-type dogs, wolf- dog hybrids and Alaskan Malamutes.US Centers for Disease Control: Breeds of dogs involved in fatal human attacks in the United States between 1979 and 1998. Retrieved 25 March 2007 According to this Center for Disease Control and Prevention study, one of the most important factors contributing to dog bites is the level of responsibility exercised by dog owners. Health The Dobermann's lifespan is about 10–13 years on average. The breed is prone to a number of health concerns. Common serious health problems include dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), cervical vertebral instability (CVI), von Willebrand's disease (a bleeding disorder for which genetic testing has been available since 2000), and prostatic disease. Less serious common health concerns include hypothyroidism and hip dysplasia. Canine compulsive disorder is also common. Studies have shown that the Doberman Pinscher suffers from prostatic diseases, (such as bacterial prostatiti, prostatic cysts, prostatic adenocarcinoma, and benign hyperplasia) more than any other breed. Dilated cardiomyopathy is a major cause of death in Dobermanns. This disease affects the breed more than any other. Nearly 40% of DCM diagnoses are for Dobermann Pinschers, followed by German Shepherds at 13%. More recent studies based on European dogs, however, has indicated that DCM affected rates are much higher for this population than their American relatives: around 58% of European Dobermanns will develop DCM within their lifetime. Research has shown that the breed is affected by an attenuated wavy fiber type of DCM that affects many other breeds, as well as an additional fatty infiltration-degenerative type that appears to be specific to Dobermann Pinscher and Boxer breeds. This serious disease is likely to be fatal in most Dobermanns affected. Roughly a quarter of Dobermann Pinschers who develop cardiomyopathy die suddenly from seemingly unknown causes, and an additional fifty percent die of congestive heart failure. Among female Dobermanns, the sudden death manifestation of the disease is more common, whereas males tend to develop congestive heart failure. In addition to being more prevalent in Dobermanns, this disease is also more serious in the breed. Following a diagnosis, the average non- Dobermann has an expected survival time of 8 months; for Dobermann Pinschers, however, the expected survival time is less than two months. Although the causes for the disease are largely unknown, there is evidence that it is a familial disease inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Investigation into the genetic causes of canine DCM may lead to therapeutic and breeding practices to limit its impact. History Dobermann, 1909 The history of the Dobermann breed is sometimes disputed by experts; however, it's generally thought that Dobermanns were first bred in the 1880s by Karl Friedrich Louis Dobermann in Apolda, Thuringia, Germany, a tax collector who ran the Apolda dog pound. With access to dogs of many breeds, he got the idea to create a breed that would be ideal for protecting him. He set out to breed a new type of dog that would exhibit impressive stamina, strength, and intelligence. Five years after Dobermann's death, Otto Goeller, one of the earliest breeders, created the National Doberman Pinscher Club and is considered to have perfected the breed, breeding and refining them in the 1890s. Dobermann Pinscher, 1915 The breed is believed to have been created from several different breeds of dogs that had the characteristics that Dobermann was looking for. The exact ratios of mixing, and even the exact breeds that were used, remain uncertain, although many experts believe that the Dobermann Pinscher is a combination of several breeds including the Beauceron, German Pinscher, Rottweiler and Weimaraner. The single exception is the documented crossing with the Greyhound and Manchester Terrier. It is also widely believed that the old German Shepherd was the single largest contributor to the Dobermann breed. Philip Greunig's The Dobermann Pinscher (1939) describes the breed's early development by Otto Goeller, who helped to establish the breed. The American Kennel Club believes the breeds utilized to develop the Dobermann Pinscher may have included the old shorthaired shepherd, Rottweiler, Black and Tan Terrier and the German Pinscher. After Dobermann's death in 1894, the Germans named the breed Dobermann-pinscher in his honor, but a half century later dropped the word 'pinscher' on the grounds that this German word for 'terrier' was no longer appropriate. The British did the same a few years later; now the US and Canada are the only countries who continue to use Pinscher and have dropped an \\"n\\" from Dobermann's surname. During World War II, the United States Marine Corps adopted the Doberman Pinscher as its official war dog, although the Corps did not exclusively use this breed in the role. In the United States, the American Kennel Club ranked the Doberman Pinscher as the 12th most popular dog breed in 2012 and 2013. Popularity The Dobermann became very popular over a short period of time. It is a relatively new breed, less than 150 years old. According to the latest ranking in 2017 by the American Kennel Club, Dobermanns are the 16th most popular dog breed. Dobermanns started to become popular when they were used in World War II as guard dogs. In the 1970s, Dobermanns had their fair share in movies. They starred in the 1972 American film The Doberman Gang. Dobermanns also became popular after winning four Westminster Kennel Club Dog Shows in 1939, 1952, 1953 and 1989. The Dobermann was recognised (as the Doberman Pinscher) by the American Kennel Club in 1908 and since then they have been one of the most popular dog breeds due to their intelligence and agility. Even today, the numbers of Dobermann dog registrations are increasing. Famous Dobermanns * Graf Belling v.

The term is normally used to describe a shallow-bottomed, barge-like vessel with two or more sails. The vessels have been around in one form or another for thousands of years, with similar craft being depicted on the walls of the tombs of Egyptian Pharaohs. Indeed, the name derives from the Arabic word for \\"gold\\", owing to similar, gilded state barges used by the Muslim rulers of Egypt in the Middle Ages. History Dahabeah on the Nile, 1891 Until the 1870s the dahabiya was the standard for tourists to travel up and down the river Nile. According to Donald Reid, in 1858 \\"a forty-day round trip from Cairo to Luxor cost about £110; a fifty-day trip to Aswan and back, about £150\\". However, Thomas Cook Ltd introduced the steam boat on the river and brought with them the organisational know how to turn a three-month voyage into a 28-day sight-seeing tour. By 1900, as trains had started to compete with the steam boat, dahabiyas were reserved only for the most wealthy, leisured travelers. This is also the time that saw great change in how dahabiyas were used and viewed. Sir John Gardner Wilkinson's 1847 book \\"Hand- book for travelers in Egypt\\" goes into great detail on how to hire a dahabiya. A traveler wishing to travel the Nile would not only have to hire the boat for the duration but provision it, de-bug and de-rat it, oversee the boatmen and even have it re-painted. However, by 1897 tour companies had made the journey much more civil. Thomas Cook promised, \\"Dragomans and other necessary servants and food supplies are carefully selected and provided\\". Modern Era Modern Nile dahabiya under tow by a tugboat, 2020 Modern dahabiyas still lack a motor-driven propellor. They are towed by diesel-powered tugboats, and have an onboard diesel-powered generator to provide electricity. Dahabeya is also the name of a specific vessel. Etymology ذهبية /ðahabīya/ is the feminine of ذهبي /ðahabī/ \\"golden\\", from ذهب /ðahab/ \\"gold\\". In Arabic the feminine suffix -a can indicate the singulative of inanimates, changing the meaning from \\"golden\\" to \\"a single golden thing\\". Thus the meaning of ذهبية is something like \\"a golden one\\".

Thus, cuisses were worn on the thighs to protect from such blows.

Whilst continental armours typically had cuisses that did not protect the back of the thigh, English cuisses were typically entirely encapsulating, due to the English preference for foot combat over the mounted cavalry charges favoured by continental armies. Cuisses could also be made of brigandine or splinted leather, but beginning around 1340 they were typically made from steel plate armour.

He studied at the New York Institute of Musical Art until 1909, when he traveled to France to study at the Conservatoire de Paris.The New Yorker, \\"Conductor: Alexander Smallens\\". Cooke, Charles , 30 June 1934, p. 10 Returning to the United States, Smallens was a conductor or music director at several American music organizations including the Boston Opera Company (1911–1914), the Anna Pavlova Ballet Company (1917–1919), the Chicago Opera Company (1919–1923), the Philadelphia Civic Opera Company (1924–1930), the Philadelphia Orchestra (1928–1934) and the Radio City Music Hall (1947–1950). In addition, Smallens worked briefly on Broadway, conducting the premieres of Thomson's Four Saints in Three Acts in 1934 and Gershwin's Porgy and Bess the next year. (Both works were operas, not the musicals normally expected in Broadway theatres.) Smallens also conducted the Porgy and Bess revivals on Broadway in 1942 and 1953, as well as the famous 1952 world tour of the work, which culminated in that 1953 Broadway production. Smallens also conducted orchestras for music as part of several documentary films in the late 1930s and early 1940s. He retired from music in 1958 and moved to Sicily. In 1972, Smallens died in Tucson, Arizona and is buried there. In 1924, Smallens was involved in an affair with composer Marc Blitzstein during a trip the two took in Europe; this was the latter's first relationship. Smallens had a son who worked in radio.

He scored a total of 128 league goals in more than 350 career appearances. Playing career Born in Hurlford, Ayrshire, Picken started his career with Hurlford Thistle before moving to nearby Kilmarnock Shawbank. In 1899, he moved to England to sign for Bolton Wanderers, where he helped the Trotters to promotion in his first season. He spent four years at Bolton, scoring 22 goals in 101 league appearances before suffering a broken leg in November 1902. In May 1903, having not played for more than six months, he moved to Plymouth Argyle. He spent a hugely successful two years with the club, scoring 46 goals in all competitions from just 89 appearances, including two hat-tricks in three games in October 1904 against New Brompton and Tottenham Hotspur, as Plymouth won the Western League title in 1904–05. His form in front of goal did not go unnoticed, and he joined Manchester United prior to the 1905–06 season. That year, he finished as top scorer, with 20 league goals and another five in the FA Cup, helping Manchester United earn promotion back to the First Division for the first time since 1894. He remained a first-team regular the following season, but found goals much harder to come by, scoring just four in 26 league appearances. For Manchester United's first league title-winning season in 1907–08, Picken lost his place as the starting inside left to fellow Hurlford native Sandy Turnbull and made just eight appearances all season, scoring once. Picken remained Turnbull's back-up for the remainder of his time at Manchester United, scoring another 14 goals in 46 appearances over three seasons. He picked up another league title in 1910–11, although he missed out on the 1909 FA Cup Final. During the 1910–11 season, Picken and Dick Holden shared a benefit, from which both players received a guaranteed £300. Picken was totally out of the picture at Manchester United by the start of the 1911–12 season, and in December 1911, he left the club after six-and-a-half years to join Burnley in the Second Division.Dykes (1994), p. 306. Despite going unbeaten at home and scoring the most goals in the entire Football League, Burnley narrowly missed out on promotion, a feat Picken had managed in his first seasons at both Bolton and Manchester United. Burnley were again the league's top scorers in 1912–13, and this time it saw them promoted as runners-up behind Preston North End. Picken chose to remain in the Second Division, however, and joined Bristol City in October 1913, where he spent the final two seasons of his career. Later life Picken returned to Plymouth after retiring from football. He died in Devonport, Plymouth on 31 July 1952.

The seats are free to rock sideways and swing out under centrifugal force as the wheel rotates. Invariably, the seats on the Paratrooper ride have a round shaped umbrella or other shaped canopy above the seats. In contrast to modern thrill rides, the Paratrooper is a ride suitable for almost all ages, except for infants and very small children. Older Paratrooper rides have a rotating wheel which is permanently raised, which has the disadvantage that riders can only load two at a time as each seat is brought to hang vertically at the lowest point of the wheel. Some models have a lower platform that's slightly raised on the ends that could permit the loading of up to three seats at a time. Most of these rides were made by either Bennett, Watkins or Hrubetz. The German manufacturer Heintz- Fahtze also made larger models under the name of Twister. Most of them require the rider to be at least 36 inches tall with an adult and over 48 to ride alone. More modern Paratrooper rides use a hydraulic lifting piston to raise the wheel to their riding angle while spinning the seats. In its lowered position, all the seats hang vertically near the ground and can be loaded simultaneously. The above manufacturers also made these types and the height requirement to ride them remains pretty much the same. Variations Two girls take the last ride of the day on a Paratrooper. The Force 10 is a ride made by Tivoli Enterprises that features some of the same motion of the Paratrooper. The Star Trooper is a variant created by Dartron Industries that features seats facing both ways. The Star Trooper's initial design eventually evolved into the Cliffhanger, also made by Dartron Industries. The same seats for this ride are used in the Swift-O-Plane and the same height requirement is just like in the Enterprise. In the 1980s, British amusement manufacturer David Ward developed the Super Trooper of which the wheel rose horizontally up a central column, once at the top the wheel slanted up to 45 degrees in either direction. He built two 12-seat versions and a 10-seat version. In 2018, PWS Rides Ltd. acquired the plans from Ward to build a new version with the first example due to be delivered in early 2019.

The prints are made on a dimensionally stable polyester base as opposed to traditional paper base. Since it uses 13 layers of azo dyes sealed in a polyester base, the print will not fade, discolour, or deteriorate for an extended time. Accelerated aging tests conducted by Henry Wilhelm rated the process as producing prints which, framed under glass, would last for 29 years before color shifts could be detected. Characteristics of Ilfochrome prints are image clarity, color purity, and being an archival process able to produce critical accuracy to the original transparency.  History  Dr. Bela Gaspar created Gasparcolor, the dye bleach process upon which the Cibachrome process was originally based. It was considered vital to the war effort in the 1940s. Gaspar turned down many offers to sell the rights to his process and after he died, Paul Dreyfus, who was the chemist and technician for Gaspar, went to work for CIBA AG. When the patents ran out, he developed the process for Cibachrome. (Frozen Moments - Richard C. Miller) In the 1960s, the Cibachrome process was originally engineered by the Ciba Geigy Corporation of Switzerland. Ciba acquired Ilford in 1969, and sold it to International Paper in 1989; in 1992 the product was renamed to \\"Ilfochrome\\". Colloquially, however the process is still referred to as \\"Cibachrome\\". Before 2004 Ilford Ltd had two main manufacturing sites: Mobberley in the UK, where most traditional products were made, and Fribourg (Freiburg) in Switzerland, where Ilfochrome and Ilfocolor papers were made, as well as the inkjet papers. The UK side was subject to a management buyout, and the Swiss operation (Ilford Imaging Switzerland GmbH) was sold to the Japanese Oji paper group in 2005 and to Paradigm Global Partners LLP in 2010. The Swiss plant retained the Ilford name, while the UK operation was inaugurated under the name HARMAN, taken from the name of the founder of the original Britannia Works. Ilford Photo HARMAN Technology Ltd can still use the Ilford brandname and logo under license on previously existing products, while new products will carry the Harman name. In 2012, Ilford announced its final production run of Ilfochrome Classic in response to declining market demand attributed to the expanding popularity of digital image making.  Advantages  The composition of the emulsion used in Ilfochrome prints is responsible for color purity, image clarity, and archival permanence. Azo dyes, which provide stable vivid colors, are embedded in the Ilfochrome emulsion and bleached out in processing. Since the dyes are in the emulsion rather than in the chemistry, the image is also much sharper and clearer because the dyes create an anti- light-scattering layer which keeps the image from being diffused when viewed. As the azo dyes are far more stable than chromogenic dyes, prints made by this process are of archival quality and galleries and art collectors report they do not fade in normal light.  Use directly in camera  An alternative use of Ilfochrome was for image capture directly inside a large format or ultra large format camera. This created a unique original positive photograph, in which the subject is reversed left-right unless a mirror or prism was used in front of the camera lens. A much longer exposure was required than with sheet films or plates designed for use in a camera. The procedure thus resembled the slow daguerreotype and ambrotype direct positive black-and-white processes used in the 1850s.

Although he is uncredited, his contributions to business organization benefited society, which included creating a user-friendly telephone directory by implementing parenthetical area codes. He received design commissions from a variety of employers, including McGraw-Hill, IBM, and the United Nations. He also worked as art director for Sweet's Catalog Service for almost twenty years. Sutnar held many one-man exhibitions, and his work is on permanent display in MoMA. He is best known for his books, including Controlled Visual Flow: Shape, Line and Color, Package Design: The Force of Visual Selling, and Visual Design in Action: Principles, Purposes. Sutnar was a master of exhibition design, typography, advertising, posters, magazine and book design. Life Sutnar's villa in Prague Sutnar studied painting at the School of Applied Arts in Prague, architecture at Charles University, and mathematics at the Czech Technical University. Post graduation, Sutnar worked on wooden toys, puppets, costumes, and stage design. Also, he contributed to exhibition design as well as teaching and the design of magazines, books, porcelain products and textiles. He taught at the State School of Graphic Arts, Prague, from 1923-36. In Europe, he gained recognition for typography and exhibition design. While still in Prague, Sutnar was an Artel Cooperative member. Other designers for Artel included Vlastislav Hofman and Rudolf Stockar. The Artel Cooperative consisted of designers from Czechoslovakia who crafted furniture and held workshops under the Wiener Werkstätte's principles of art accessibility. Medium included ceramics, textiles, carpets, furniture, and metal aiming to visually improve the experiences of daily life. The organization came to an end in 1924. Plaques of Sutnar In 1927, Sutnar became the head of publication design for a large publisher in Prague. Then in 1928 he went to the Pressa international exhibition, taking responsibility for the Czech pavilion there. He was accompanied by Augustin Tschinkel. He was made director of the State School of Graphic Arts beginning in 1932. Sutnar continued his work in exhibition design and received a Gold Medal at the 1929 Barcelona Exhibition. Sutnar was also an art director of a book publisher and editor of an architectural magazine. Sutnar was brought to the United States to design the exhibition for Czechoslovakia at the New York World Fair in 1939. Due to its cancellation, he chose to settle in New York leaving his family behind in Prague as Nazi control continued there. In 1941, he became art director of F.W. Dodge's Sweet's Catalog Service from 1941 until 1960 where he led the development of information design along with Knud Lonberg-Holm. The company produced and distributed trade and manufacturing catalogues. Sutnar implemented both typographic and iconographic characters that enabled viewers to quickly and successfully navigate through an overwhelming amount of information. He did this by making use of grids, tabs, icons, and symbols. Sutnar and Holm published New Patterns in Product Information in 1944. Their reductive approach aimed for clarity and simplicity for all users with \\"active design elements\\". At the same time, he added punctuation into traffic signs in the United States. He continued his typographic design for advertising and corporations as he was art director for Theatre Arts magazine for ten years. He also created trends in glassware and flatware products. Information graphics Sutnar was not credited for the implementation of parentheses around the American area code for Bell System (late 1950s-early 1960s). This addition allowed much easier access to normal and emergency services. The reason for lack of credit lies in the fact that Bell System considered \\"graphic designers as transparent as the function graphics they designed.\\" Sutnar used parentheses in his own work to highlight and distinguish information. Sutnar himself said that the absence of these organizational methods and simplified legibility makes everyday activities much more difficult to accomplish. Graphic design was responding to the growing pace of information standards and the need to communicate faster. Sutnar was one of the first designers to actively practice in the field of information design. His work was based on rationality and the process of displaying massive amounts of information in a concise and organized way to benefit the general viewer. Typography and a limited color palette was stressed in his work. He often used punctuation symbols to help organize information, but his signature creation was the idea to place parentheses around the area codes in telephone books. While serving as art director for Sweet's Catalog Services, he created information graphics and catalog layouts for a wide range of manufactured items. He was heavily influenced by the ideas of Modernism and his work was well structured. =Styles and design= Borrowing from the principles of De Stijl, Sutnar's work had a reduction to primary colors, straight lines, and an overall harmony of irregular text alignment. His strong use of diagonal elements, typography and imagery more strongly conveys his design style to be classified as Constructivism. Space is divided into white and black areas and consist of elements with symbolism. Similar to Jan Tschichold's work and modern typography, his style was limited to type and color within strict layouts. More strongly, his work connected with the Bauhaus fundamentals. His work is simple but suggests motion with vivid colors and directional patterns. *Book design **Sutnar designed the book jacket for George Bernard Shaw's Obraceni Kapitana Brassbounda in 1932. **Sutnar's cover of Nejmenší dům (The Smallest House) uses only the colors black, white and red and a diagonal title. *Poster design **Visit the Modern Textile Exhibition (1930) demonstrated the \\"ability of written characters to focus attention without the help of a pictorial image\\" with a rectangular arrangement and different text sizes based on a hierarchy of information. *Toy design **Starting in 1924, Sutnar designed toys consisting of simple geometric structures of animals and puppets. He attempted to introduce modern aesthetics into children's toys by developing a building kit that consisted of sawtooth roofs, cones, and pieces in the colors of red, blue, and white (this remained a prototype). He also wrote a children's book on the future of traffic in Transport: Next Half Century. Sutnar created art-oriented toys, i.e. \\"Apisonadora\\" (construction vehicle). =Strip Street= The 1960s proved to be a difficult time for the designer as he turned to publishing Strip Street (1963). It was an album of 12 erotic silk-screen prints. Sutnar organized two New York gallery exhibitions of his nudes, In Pursuit of Venus (1966) and Venus: Joy-Art (1969). These works outside of his norm still included Sutnar's hierarchical design approach as a father of modern information design. The term \\"posters without words\\" refers to Sutnar's distinct poster-like design that characterizes the individual prints of this series. Sutnar's paintings are reproduced in a 392-page monograph. His racy Strip Street compilation has been relatively forgotten. He wrote an essay to accompany these works. \\"In these disturbed times of cool and alienated society,\\" he wrote, \\"if the paintings can inject the feeling, the mission is accomplished.\\" An influence of pop is notable despite Sutnar's dislike of pop and pop art. Published books *Catalog Design was a handbook by Sutnar in 1944 for trade catalogs using constructivist principles. *Catalog Design Progress by Sutnar and Holm solved sales and advertising problems by focusing on product information and \\"living standards\\" of all forms of information design. It was based on the idea that logical compositions would enable quick access to common information. Composed of four parts, it begins with patterns influenced by industrialization, such as street patterns and transportation. Part two features visual features of design, typography, pictures, charts, and covers. Color, shape, and size are used as tools to direct eye movement. Part three directs structural or layout features, i.e., page, catalog, and file organization. The last part is devoted to fundamental design principles: form and flow. *Design for Point of Sale (1952) was a survey of contemporary methods of in-store display. *Package Design: the Force of Visual Selling (1953) *Visual Design in Action (1961) argues for future advances in graphic design and defines design. This Modern design book has been compared to Tschichold's Die Neue Typographie. It was an exhibition of his work and a self-funded book. Influence and legacy Although well after his time, Sutnar's methods of conveying information in a manner that evoked attention can be linked to the navigational aids of web design. The Ladislav Sutnar Faculty of Design and Art, part of the University of West Bohemia and located in the designer's birthplace of Plzeň, was named in his honor on 1 April 2014.

KML was developed for use with Google Earth, which was originally named Keyhole Earth Viewer. It was created by Keyhole, Inc, which was acquired by Google in 2004. KML became an international standard of the Open Geospatial Consortium in 2008. Google Earth was the first program able to view and graphically edit KML files, but other projects such as Marble have added KML support.  Structure  The KML file specifies a set of features (place marks, images, polygons, 3D models, textual descriptions, etc.) that can be displayed on maps in geospatial software implementing the KML encoding. Each place always has a longitude and a latitude. Other data can make the view more specific, such as tilt, heading, altitude, which together define a \\"camera view\\" along with a timestamp or timespan. KML shares some of the same structural grammar as Geography Markup Language (GML). Some KML information cannot be viewed in Google Maps or Mobile. KML files are very often distributed in KMZ files, which are zipped KML files with a .kmz extension. The contents of a KMZ file are a single root KML document (notionally \\"doc.kml\\") and optionally any overlays, images, icons, and COLLADA 3D models referenced in the KML including network-linked KML files. The root KML document by convention is a file named \\"doc.kml\\" at the root directory level, which is the file loaded upon opening. By convention the root KML document is at root level and referenced files are in subdirectories (e.g. images for overlay images). An example KML document is: New York City New York City -74.006393,40.714172,0 The MIME type associated with KML is application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml; the MIME type associated with KMZ is application/vnd.google-earth.kmz.  Geodetic reference systems in KML  For its reference system, KML uses 3D geographic coordinates: longitude, latitude and altitude, in that order, with negative values for west, south and below mean sea level if the altitude data is available. The longitude, latitude components (decimal degrees) are as defined by the World Geodetic System of 1984 (WGS84). The vertical component (altitude) is measured in meters from the WGS84 EGM96 Geoid vertical datum. If altitude is omitted from a coordinate string, e.g. (-77.03647, 38.89763) then the default value of 0 (approximately sea level) is assumed for the altitude component, i.e. (-77.03647, 38.89763, 0). A formal definition of the coordinate reference system (encoded as GML) used by KML is contained in the OGC KML 2.2 Specification. This definition references well-known EPSG CRS components.  OGC standard process  The KML 2.2 specification was submitted to the Open Geospatial Consortium to assure its status as an open standard for all geobrowsers. In November 2007 a new KML 2.2 Standards Working Group was established within OGC to formalize KML 2.2 as an OGC standard. Comments were sought on the proposed standard until January 4, 2008, and it became an official OGC standard on April 14, 2008. The OGC KML Standards Working Group finished working on change requests to KML 2.2 and incorporated accepted changes into the KML 2.3 standard. The official OGC KML 2.3 standard was published on August 4, 2015.

It describes how much more massive the vehicle is with propellant than without; that is, the ratio of the rocket's wet mass (vehicle plus contents plus propellant) to its dry mass (vehicle plus contents). A more efficient rocket design requires less propellant to achieve a given goal, and would therefore have a lower mass ratio; however, for any given efficiency a higher mass ratio typically permits the vehicle to achieve higher delta-v. The mass ratio is a useful quantity for back-of-the-envelope rocketry calculations: it is an easy number to derive from either \\\\Delta{v} or from rocket and propellant mass, and therefore serves as a handy bridge between the two. It is also a useful for getting an impression of the size of a rocket: while two rockets with mass fractions of, say, 92% and 95% may appear similar, the corresponding mass ratios of 12.5 and 20 clearly indicate that the latter system requires much more propellant. Typical multistage rockets have mass ratios in the range from 8 to 20. The Space Shuttle, for example, has a mass ratio around 16.  Derivation  The definition arises naturally from Tsiolkovsky's rocket equation: :\\\\Delta v = v_e \\\\ln \\\\frac {m_0} {m_1} where :*Δv is the desired change in the rocket's velocity :*ve is the effective exhaust velocity (see specific impulse) :*m0 is the initial mass (rocket plus contents plus propellant) :*m1 is the final mass (rocket plus contents) This equation can be rewritten in the following equivalent form: :\\\\frac {m_0} {m_1} = e ^ { \\\\Delta v / v_e } The fraction on the left-hand side of this equation is the rocket's mass ratio by definition. This equation indicates that a Δv of n times the exhaust velocity requires a mass ratio of e^n. For instance, for a vehicle to achieve a \\\\Delta v of 2.5 times its exhaust velocity would require a mass ratio of e^{2.5} (approximately 12.2). One could say that a \\"velocity ratio\\" of n requires a mass ratio of e^n. Sutton defines the mass ratio inversely as:Rocket Propulsion Elements, 7th Edition by George P. Sutton, Oscar Biblarz :M_R = \\\\frac {m_1} {m_0} In this case, the values for mass fraction are always less than 1.

Its first incarnation appeared in 1990 and was distributed at participating Pizza Hut restaurants; this version of the magazine only saw two issues. The magazine returned in the summer of 1993 with different type of content, primarily humor and comics. Originally published on a quarterly basis, it switched to bi-monthly with the February/March 1994 issue. It then went to ten times per year starting March 1995, with a bi-annual December/January and June/July issue until its end in 2009. On February 5, 2015, Papercutz announced that they worked a deal with Nickelodeon to revive the magazine. The new version was first released in June 2015, and new issues were released monthly until 2016. Format First Papercutz magazine cover In spite of being related to the network it was named after, Nickelodeon Magazine covered all sorts of topics, not just what was on the network. The magazine contained informative non-fiction pieces, humor, interviews, comics, pranks and recipes (such as green slime cake). The magazine's mascot was Zelda Van Gutters, a Lakeland Terrier dog who appeared throughout the magazine with sarcastic asides on the articles. She was also the star of the magazine's semi-regular photo comic strip \\"Ruffing It\\". Other contributors included Dan Abdo, John Accurso, Bill Alger, Graham Annable, Ian Baker, Tom Bunk, Martin Cendreda, Greg Cook, Dave Cooper, Jordan Crane, Mark Crilley, Scott Cunningham, Vincent Deporter, Stephen DeStefano, Evan Dorkin, Brent Engstrom, Feggo (Felipe Galindo), Gary Fields, Emily Flake, Ellen Forney, Francho (Arnoldo Franchioni), Dave Fremont, Tom Gauld, Justin Green, Tim Hamilton, Charise Maricle Harper, Paul Karasik, John Kerschbaum, Jacob Lambert, Roger Langridge, Chris Lanier, Robert Leighton, Alec Longstreth, Jason Lutes, Pat Moriarity, Dan Moynihan, Nate Neal, Mark Newgarden, Travis Nichols, Lark Pien, Johnny Ryan, P.Shaw!, Karen Sneider, Israel Sanchez, Jason Shiga, R.

In addition, Nickelodeon Magazine's Comic Book also featured comics from characters of the network's programming, which usually appeared just before a season premiere or special film event for the property on the actual series. Among the Nicktoons that were featured in the Comic Book: * Aaahh!!! Real Monsters * The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron * All Grown Up! * The Angry Beavers * As Told by Ginger * Avatar: The Last Airbender * CatDog * Catscratch * ChalkZone * Danny Phantom * Doug * El Tigre: The Adventures of Manny Rivera * The Fairly OddParents * Hey Arnold! * Invader Zim * KaBlam! * Mr. Meaty * My Life as a Teenage Robot * Oh Yeah!

Each issue tied in with comics. Nickelodeon Comics mainly contained comics, either newly made stories or two-page shorts reprinted from Nick Magazine, but also featured articles, puzzles, and poster inserts. Other comics included: * Fiona of the Felines by Terry LaBan – A girl who is raised by cats. Her strips are occasionally accompanied by a similar strip titled Warren of the Worms. * Grampa and Julie, Shark Hunters by Jef Czekaj – This strip's titular pair of a girl and her dim-witted grandfather started out searching for Stephen, the Largest Shark in the World. Their adventures from 1999 to 2003 have recently been reprinted in a graphic novel and a Television pilot for an animated series was made by Klasky Csupo. * Impy & Wormer by James Kochalka – These mini-strips (featured at the bottom of the comic pages, under the regular strips) starred a bug who does not speak proper English and constantly bothers a comparatively intellectual worm. * Juanita and Clem by Craig Thompson — Whimsical tales of an adventurous little girl (Juanita) and her less brave green friend (Clem). * Karmopolis by Nick Bertozzi — An adventure strip in a world where everyone and everything is on wheels. * Mervin the Magnificent by Richard Sala — A bumbling magician named Mervin solves crime with his rabbit sidekick. * Patty-Cake by Scott Roberts – A bossy little blonde with a flower in her hair. * Sam Hill & Ray-9 by Mark Martin – A boy and his robot dog. * Scene But Not Heard by Sam Henderson – The going-ons of a pink man and a bear, who compulsively pull pranks on each other. As the strip's name suggests, the comic is made entirely of pictures with no dialogue or sound effects. In the magazine's tenth anniversary issue, there was a \\"blooper strip\\" where the man and bear are talking. Also, there is an advertisement for a Scene But Not Heard musical in Grampa and Julie comic. * Southern Fried Fugitives by Simon and Kim Deitch – The continuing adventures of a quartet of fried chicken pieces brought to life by a thunderstorm. This strip ended in December 1999. * Teeny Weeny, the Tiniest Hot Dog in the World by Mark Martin (2005) – A miniature, but enthusiastic, hot dog. * The Gag Station by various. One-panel gags, often featuring cartoonists such as Johnny Ryan, Mark Newgarden, Ellen Forney, Steve Weissman, Felipe Galindo, Ian Baker and Mark Martin. * The Uncredibly Confabulated Tales of Lucinda Ziggles by Andy Ristaino — A little girl gets involved in fantastic adventures that nobody ever believes. * Twiggy Stumps: Outdoor Adventurist by Brian Ralph — A flaky outdoorsman and his wisecracking skunk-pal, Juniper. * Underpants-On- His-Head Man by Michael Kupperman – Originally appeared as one of \\"the worst comic book superheroes ever\\". As his name suggests, he wears his underwear on his head. His archenemy is his coworker, Pants-On-His-Head Man. * Yam by Corey Barba — A wordless comic starring a toddler with jet backpack, wearing a hoodie, in a whimsical world that features humanlike cats, pet TVs and other fantasy elements.  Posters  Nickelodeon Magazine contained posters in every issue. They were often prank messages for the reader to hang on their bedroom door or elsewhere in their house. United Kingdom version A British version of the magazine was published from 16 February 2011 as a collaboration between Nickelodeon and D. C. Thomson & Co. It seems to have been discontinued as of June 2012. Second Era Viacom ended operations of the magazine in June 2009 due to economic conditions and the continual move of the network's content to their website. The title continued to publish until the December/January 2010 issue, and the final issue featured an editorial from magazine SVP/Editorial Director Laura Galen thanking the magazine's readers. On February 5, 2015, Papercutz announced that they have worked a deal with Nickelodeon to revive the magazine. The new version was released in June 2015 and ended in 2016.

It was officially proclaimed on 22 July 1944 in Chełm, installed on 26 July in Lublin and placed formally under the direction of the State National Council (Krajowa Rada Narodowa, KRN). The PKWN was a provisional entity functioning in opposition to the London-based Polish government-in-exile, which was recognized by the Western allies... The PKWN exercised control over Polish territory retaken from Nazi Germany by the Soviet Red Army and the Polish People's Army. It was sponsored and controlled by the Soviet Union and dominated by Polish communists. Formation At the time of the formation of the PKWN, the principal Polish authority in German-occupied Poland was the Polish Underground State network of organizations loyal to the Polish government-in- exile, resident in London. As the Red Army, fighting Nazi German forces, entered Polish territory, Joseph Stalin and Polish communists proceeded with the establishment of a rival executive authority, one that they could control.. The PKWN was formed in negotiations involving primarily the main Polish communist organizations, the Union of Polish Patriots (ZPP) and the Polish Workers' Party (PPR).. The Polish communist movement had been decimated during the Soviet purges in the 1930s, but revived under Stalin's auspices beginning in 1940... The PPR was a new party organized in occupied Poland, the ZPP originated during the war in the Soviet Union. The PPR had already established in Warsaw a conspiratorial State National Council (KRN), which they declared to be the wartime national parliament.. Because of war-related obstacles, the communist leaders arriving from Warsaw (the PPR delegation that included Władysław Gomułka and Bolesław Bierut) reached Lublin only on 31 July, and attained full agreement with the group from Moscow (ZPP) on 15 August. The documents they produced were antedated to 21 July to comply with the declarations issued as of 22 July. The PKWN Manifesto, proclaimed on 22 July 1944, was outlined in advance in a Radio Moscow broadcast. The PKWN, located in Lublin, became known as the Lublin Committee. While the administrative authority in Poland was granted to the PKWN, many aspects of wartime governance were determined by the Soviet military surveillance. As the Red Army and the allied Polish Army moved into Polish territory, the PKWN expanded its authority within the liberated areas, except for Kresy (prewar eastern Poland), intended by the Allies to be incorporated into the Soviet Union (see Tehran Conference, Yalta Conference). Membership Among the members of the PKWN were politicians of various communist and leftist parties accepted by Stalin. Its chairman was Edward Osóbka-Morawski of the Polish Socialist Party (PPS). His deputies were Wanda Wasilewska and Andrzej Witos of the Union of Polish Patriots (ZPP); Witos was a younger brother of Wincenty Witos, a notable pre-war politician.. Andrzej Witos was later replaced by Stanisław Janusz. The fifteen members included those from the KRN and the ZPP. Officially, three were from the Polish Socialist Workers' Party (RPPS, a left- wing PPS faction), four represented the agrarian People's Party (SL), one the Democratic Party (SD), five the Polish Workers' Party (PPR) and two were unaffiliated.. Stanisław Radkiewicz was responsible for the security department and Michał Rola-Żymierski for the defense department. The Soviet side was represented by Nikolai Bulganin, whose role was to provide support for the PKWN's administration and security apparatus, and who was charged with destruction of political and military groupings representing the Polish government-in-exile. The PKWN presented itself as a broad leftist and democratic coalition, but the major Polish political parties were not officially represented. According to historian Norman Davies, most of the key positions in the PKWN were given to people who were essentially Soviet employees and not PPR members.. Security, propaganda and military affairs departments were controlled by communists. Policies The PKWN Manifesto promised radical agrarian reforms, expansion of Polish territory to the west at the expense of Germany, and adherence to the 1921 March Constitution of Poland. It called the Polish government-in-exile an usurper and the 1935 April Constitution of Poland fascist.. At the outset, Polish communists had marginal support among the Polish population and the new regime was completely dependent on Moscow. The committee's early decrees authorized the NKVD's control over the Red Army's 'rear areas' (in practice all of Poland) and announced a restoration of the Polish Army under Soviet leadership. The PKWN used a combination of repressive and co-optive measures. It appealed to patriotic sentiment, sponsored cultural activities, and implemented a popular and long-overdue land reform. No revolutionary changes were introduced beyond the land reform. The new Polish army, largely staffed with Soviet officers (most of the Polish officer corps present in the east was eliminated in the Katyn massacre or left the Soviet Union with Anders' Army), retained the appearance of a national army and participated in the Soviet offensive all the way to Berlin... At the end of December 1944, the PKWN was reconstituted as the Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland (RTRP), which was formally recognized by the Soviet Union in January 1945. The government-in- exile retained for the time being the recognition of the United States and the United Kingdom, but in reality the Western powers no longer considered it relevant as an international settlement on the issue of Poland's government was sought..

History  The first bearer of the Bettelheim name is said to have lived toward the second half of the 18th century, in Pressburg (Pozsony, today Bratislava). To account for its origin, the following episode is related in the family records: There was a Jewish merchant in Bratislava (now in Slovakia) (before Pozsony), whose modest demeanor gained for him the esteem of his fellow-townsmen. He was popularly called \\"Ein ehrlich Jud\\" (honest Jew). His wife was a woman of surpassing beauty, and many magnates of the country, hearing of her charms, traveled to Pozsony to see her. Count Bethlen was particularly persistent, and, failing to attract her attention, he decided to abduct her. Mounted on his charger, he appeared one day in the open market, where the virtuous woman was making purchases, and in the sight of hundreds of spectators, lifted her on his horse, and heedless of her cries of entreaty, was about to gallop off with her, when her husband appeared on the scene and, after a fierce personal combat, succeeded in rescuing her. That a Jew should engage in a hand-to-hand encounter with a nobleman of the rank of Count Bethlen was so unprecedented, and the deed itself was so daring in view of the social status of the Jews of those times (which remained unchanged until the liberal laws of Emperor Joseph II were promulgated), that the populace thenceforth styled the hero of the story \\"Bethlen-Jude\\". This name clung to him until the royal edict, bidding Jews to assume family names, went into force, and then the name was changed to \\"Bettelheim\\". Among the family relics preserved by a scion of the house in Freystadtel, on the Waga (), is an oil painting that depicts the daring rescue of Bethlen-Jude's wife from the hands of her abductor.

Ritual Due to the nature of Unitarian Universalism, traditions vary from one congregation to another; however, most Water Communions follow the same general idea. Throughout the year, members of the congregation collect small amounts of water that have meaning for them, either from a special location (e.g., the family home, an ocean or river, memento of a trip) or a special occasion (first rain after a dry spell). At the service, the samples of water are placed in a single bowl so they can merge. Some of the water is often saved, sterilized, and then used for ceremonial purposes at other times of the year; the rest is returned to the world. \\"Returning Water to the Earth\\" Symbolism The symbolism, like that of the comparable Flower Communion, can be interpreted in various ways. The classic life-related symbolism of water is apparent. The rejoining of many waters can also symbolize the rejoining of the congregation after summer travels. McDade and Longview chose this way to honor the \\"journeys\\" of women, and to represent the way women both contribute to and draw from each other's strength, working both individually and together, to bring change.

The ruins of the town extend for five miles along the River Ziz in the Tafilalt oasis near the town of Rissani. The town's history was marked by several successive invasions by Berber dynasties. Up until the 14th century, as the northern terminus for the western trans-Sahara trade route, it was one of the most important trade centres in the Maghreb during the Middle Ages.  History  Map of Idrisid Morocco and its neighbors, showing Beni-Midrar's kingdom, the Kingdom of SijilmasaR. William Caverly, Hosting Dynasties and Faiths : Chronicling the Religious History of a Medieval Moroccan Oasis City, thesis presented to Hamline University Trade routes of the western Sahara c. 1000–500. Goldfields are indicated by light brown shading. According to al-Bakri's Book of Routes and Places, Sufrite Kharijites first settled the town in the wake of the Berber revolts against the Umayyads. Al-Bakri recounts that others joined these early settlers there, until they numbered around four thousand, at which point they laid the groundwork for the city. They elected a leader, 'Isa bin Mazid al-Aswad (the Black), to handle their affairs during the earliest first few years after the town's establishment. However, after ruling for 14 years, he was blamed by his companions of corruption and executed. Abu al-Qasim Samgu bin Wasul al- Miknasi, chief of a branch of the Miknasa tribe, became the leader of the town. This Abu al-Qasim and his descendants are known as the Midrar dynasty. The Arab geographer Ibn Hawqal visited Spain and the Maghreb between 947 and 951 A.D. According to the account in his Kitab Surat al-Ard completed in around 988 AD, Sijilmasa grew in economic power due to shifting trade routes. At one time trade between Egypt and the Ghana Empire took a direct route across the desert, but because of the harsh conditions, this route was abandoned. Instead caravans passed through the Maghreb to Sijilmasa and then headed south across the Sahara. Sijilmasa's economic wealth is evidenced by Ibn Hawqal's story about a bill issued to a trader in Awdaghust for forty-two thousand dinars from another merchant based out of Sijilmasa. Ibn Hawqal explains that he has never heard of such a large sum of money in all of his travels. Not only was Ibn Hawqal impressed with the volume of trade with the Maghrib and Egypt, Al-Masudi noted gold from Sudan was minted here. On account of its wealth, the city was able to assert its independence under the Midrarid dynasty, freeing itself from the Abbasid Caliphate as early as 771. Shifting alliances with the Caliphate of Córdoba and the Fatimids of Ifriqiya destabilized the city during the 10th century, beginning with Abd Allah al- Mahdi Billah's visit to the city, the man who was later known as the founder of the Fatamid dynasty. 'Abd Allah, accompanied by his son al-Qa'im, arrived in the Maghreb in 905. 'Abd Allah and his son made their way to Sijilmasa, fleeing persecution by the Abbasids, who not only belonged to the Isma'ili Shi'ite interpretations, but also threatening to the status quo of Abbasi caliphate. According to legend, 'Abd Allah and his son were fulfilling a prophecy that the madhi would come from Mesopotamia to Sijilmasa. They hid among the population of Sijilmasa for four years under the countenance of the Midrar rulers, specifically one Prince Yasa'. Al-Qasim, the son of the mahdi, had miraculous powers and caused a spring to gush forth outside of the city. A Jewish resident of the city witnessed this, and spread the word throughout Sijilmasa that 'Abd Allah was going to attempt to take over the city. At or around the same time, Prince Yasa', the Midrarid ruler, received a letter from the Abbasids in Baghdad, warning him to close his frontiers and be wary of 'Abd Allah. Yasa' was forced to imprison the men he had previously patronized. 'Abd Allah's servant escaped to Kairouan, which at the time was a stronghold for Isma'ilis. The leader of the Isma'ilis in Ifriqiya was Abu 'Abdallah; he quickly mustered an army to rescue his compatriot. On his way to Sijilmasa, he subdued Tahert, the nearby Ibadi Kharijite stronghold under the Rustamid dynasty. The army arrived in the Tafilalt in the latter half of 909, and laid siege to the city. After Yasa' was killed in that year or the next, the Midrar dynasty began a long process of fragmentation that eventually resulted in a hostile takeover by the Maghrawa Berbers, former clients of the Cordoban caliphate.This story is related in Al-Bakri's account in Levtzion, \\"Corpus\\" Under the Maghrawa, who later declared independence from the Cordoban caliphate, the city retained its role as a trade centre. It also became a center for Maghrawan government and its campaign against other tribes in Morocco proper. After 60 years of Maghrawa rule, the elders of Sijilmasa appealed to the Sanhaja Berber confederation, which was just beginning its transformation into the Almoravid dynasty. According to al-Bakri, in 1055, Abdallah ibn Yasin, the spiritual leader of the Almoravid movement, responded by bringing his new army to Sijilmasa and killed the leader of the Maghrawa, Mas'ud ibn Wanudin al-Maghrawi. The Almoravid imposed an extremely strict interpretation of Islam, smashing music instruments and closing down wine shops throughout the city. While the city would rebel against the Almoravid garrison on more than one occasion, Sijilmasa became the Almoravid's first conquest. It remained under their control until 1146, when the Almohad Caliphate took control of the city. During the Almoravid's rule, the city shared in the centralized governing structure of the Almoravid Empire.. \\"Abd Allah b Yasin and the Almoravids\\". Around this time the nearby mountain fortress of Jebel Mudawwar was established. When the Almohad took the city in the mid-12th century, they also took advantage of the wealth of trade going through Sijilmasa. However, the strict philosophy imposed by the Almoravid at the beginning of their reign of Sijilmasa was overshadowed by the extremely violent practices of the Almohad. This culminated in the massacre of many of the Jews living in Sijilmasa.This is an observation made by Hirschberg in A History of the Jews in North Africa, pp. 109, 116–118 Amid the fall of the Almohad dynasty to the Zenata Berber confederation under the Marinid, Sijilmasa once again played host to the latest Berber dynasty. The Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta stayed in Sijilmasa on his journey to visit the Mali Empire in 1352–1353. He wrote: \\"I reached the city of Sijilmasa, a very beautiful city. It has abundant dates of good quality. The city of al-Basra is like it in the abundance of dates, but those of Sijilmasa are superior.\\" Ibn Battuta also mentions Sijilmasa when describing the Chinese town of Quanzhou: \\"In this city, as in all cities in China, men have orchards and fields and their houses in the middle, as they are in Siljimasa in our country. This is why their towns are so big.\\" The next mention of Sijilmasa in the extant sources is that of Leo Africanus, who, travelling to Morocco in the early 16th century, goes to the Tafilalt oasis and finds Sijilmasa destroyed. He remarks on the \\"most stately and high walls\\", which were apparently still standing. He continues to describe the city as \\"gallantly builte,\\" writing there were many stately temples and colleges in the city, and water wheels that drew water out of the river Ziz. Leo Africanus says that since the city was destroyed, former residents had moved into outlying villages and castles. He stayed in this area for seven months, saying that it was temperate and pleasant. According to Leo Africanus, the city was destroyed when its last prince was assassinated by the citizens of Sijilmasa, after which the populace spread across the countryside.Leo Africanus, A Geographical History of Africa, 260–271 Ibn Khaldun says in his Muqaddimah that the city fell due to a lack of resources.Ibn Khaldun, Muqaddimah, 248 Lightfoot and Miller cite several facts from their findings on site: they say that oral tradition preserved by those in the Tafilalt says that the \\"Black Sultan\\", a malevolent dictator, was overthrown by the populace. The city was rebuilt in the 18th century under the orders of Sultan Moulay Ismail. It was conquered and destroyed by the nomadic tribes of Ait Atta in 1818. Today, the ruins of Sijilmasa, a couple of km north of the town of Rissani, are recognized by the World Monuments Fund as an endangered site. They are preserved by the Moroccan Ministry of Culture.

Sleep bruxism is purported to lead to a hyperactivity of the trigeminal nerve, often triggering typical migraine events. The hyperactivity of trigeminal neurons during trigemino- nociceptive stimulation is a proposed cause of migraine and is correlated with imaging of migraine sufferers.Burstein, R., Noseda, R., & Borsook, D. (April 29 2015). Migraine: Multiple Processes, Complex Pathophysiology. Journal of Neuroscience, 35(17), 6619-6629. The objective of the NTI-TSS is to relax the muscles involved in clenching and bruxing, thus supposedly diminishing the chances for migraines and tension headaches to develop through the reduction in nociceptive stimulation normally caused by parafunctional activity. It is sometimes used for temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD). The NTI-TSS is a small transparent plastic device which is, in its most widely used form, worn over the front four teeth, of either arch, at night, and intended to prevent contact of the canines and molars. It is normally fitted by a dentist trained in the technique, and is constructed by a dental laboratory.https://nationaldentex.com/products/headache-therapy/nti-tss-plus Evidence and safety As the NTI-TSS does not cover all of the teeth, it is classed as a partial coverage occlusal splint. Partial coverage splints are recommended by some experts, but they have the potential to cause unwanted tooth movements if worn 24 hours a day 7 days a week with no tooth contact (which is never recommended), which rarely can be severe. Since the patient cannot wear the NTI-tss device while chewing food, the posterior alveolar structures receive regular stimulation every day, therefore, there is no opportunity for a functional adaptation of the occlusal scheme, that is supra- eruption of the teeth. Research shows that alveolar bone requires at least 8 days of lack of stimulation before bone growth at the apex (supra-eruption) can initiate. Periodontal ligament that surrounds the root and holds the tooth in place - if this ligament is stimulated (exercised) it will continue holding the teeth in correct position. As for anterior intrusion, the lack of continuous apical force does not provide adequate opportunity to intrude an incisor. A 2010 review of scientific studies carried out to investigate the use of occlusal splints in TMD concluded the following with regards anterior bite appliances (another term for partial coverage occlusal splints that cover only the front teeth): > \\"Other types of appliances, including [...] anterior bite appliances, have > some RCT (randomized control trial) evidence of efficacy in reducing TMD > pain. However, the potential for adverse events with these appliances is > higher and suggests the need for close monitoring in their use.\\" References Category:Dentistry ","title":"Nociceptive trigeminal inhibition tension suppression system"},{"id":"2139891","text":"Janelle 'Penny' Commissiong (born June 15, 1953) is a Trinidadian politician, model and beauty queen.

Topicalization often results in a discontinuity and is thus one of a number of established discontinuity types (the other three being wh-fronting, scrambling, and extraposition). Topicalization is also used as a constituency test; an expression that can be topicalized is deemed a constituent.For examples of topicalization used as a constituency test, see for instance Allerton (1979:114), Borsley (1991:24), Napoli (1993:422), Burton-Roberts (1997:17), Poole (2002:32), Radford (2004:72), Haegeman (2006:790). The topicalization of arguments in English is rare, whereas circumstantial adjuncts are often topicalized. Most languages allow topicalization, and in some languages, topicalization occurs much more frequently and/or in a much less marked manner than in English. Topicalization in English has also received attention in the pragmatics literature. Concerning topicalization as discussed in the pragmatics literature, see for example Prince (1998). Examples Typical cases of topicalization are illustrated with the following examples: ::a. The boys roll rocks for entertainment. ::b. For entertainment, the boys roll rocks. -Topicalization of the adjunct for entertainment ::a. Everyone refused to answer because the pressure was too great. ::b. Because the pressure was too great, everyone refused to answer. - Topicalization of the adjunct because the pressure was too great ::a. I won't eat that pizza. ::b. That pizza, I won't eat. - Topicalization of the object argument that pizza ::a. I am terrified of those dogs. ::b. Those dogs, I am terrified of. - Topicalization of the object argument those dogs Assuming that the a-sentences represent canonical word order, the b-sentences contain instances of topicalization. The constituent in bold is fronted in order to establish it as topic. The first two examples, which use topicalized adjuncts, are typical, whereas the two latter examples with topicalized object arguments are comparatively rare. The appearance of the demonstrative determiners that and those is important, since without them, topicalization of an argument seems less acceptable, e.g. ?A pizza I won't eat. Topicalization can occur across long distances, e.g. ::a. I thought you said that Tom believes the explanation needs such examples. ::b. Such examples I thought you said that Tom believes the explanation needs. - Topicalization of the object argument such examples over a long distance Further examples Topicalization is similar to wh-movement insofar as the constituents that can be wh-fronted can also be topicalized, e.g. ::a. Bill is living in that one house on the hill. ::b. Which house is Bill living in? - Wh-fronting of NP resulting in preposition stranding ::c. That one house on the hill Bill is living in. - Topicalization of NP resulting in preposition stranding ::a. Shelly has indeed uncovered part of our plan. ::b. What has Shelly indeed uncovered part of? - Wh-fronting out of object NP resulting in preposition stranding ::c. Our plan Shelly has indeed uncovered part of. - Topicalization out of object NP resulting in preposition stranding And topicalization is similar to wh- fronting insofar as the islands and barriers to wh-fronting are also islands and barriers to topicalization, e.g. ::a. The description of his aunt was really funny. ::b. *Whose aunt was the description of really funny? - Wh- fronting impossible out of a subject in English ::c. *His aunt the description of was really funny. - Topicalization impossible out of a subject in English ::a. He relaxes after he's played Starcraft. ::b. *What does he relax after he's played? - Wh-fronting impossible out of adjunct clause ::c. *Starcraft he relaxes after he's played. - Topicalization impossible out of adjunct clause ::a. She approves of the suggestion to make pasta. ::b. *What does she approve of the suggestion to make? - Wh-fronting impossible out of complex NP ::c. *Pasta she approves of the suggestion to make. - Topicalization impossible out of complex NP These examples illustrate the similar behavior of topicalization and wh-fronting. Further data, which will not be produced here, could show, however, that topicalization is unlike the other two major discontinuity types, i.e. scrambling and extraposition. Theoretical analyses The theoretical analysis of topicalization can vary greatly depending in part on the theory of sentence structure that one adopts. If one assumes the layered structures associated with many phrase structure grammars, all instances of topicalization will involve a discontinuity. If, in contrast, less layered structures are assumed as for example in dependency grammar, then many instances of topicalization do not involve a discontinuity, but rather just inversion.Two prominent sources on dependency grammar are Tesnière (1959) and Ágel (2003/6). This point is illustrated here first using flatter structures that lack a finite VP-constituent (which means the entire sentence has the status of a large VP). Both constituency- and dependency-based analyses are given. The example itself is a piece of Yoda wisdom (as he speaks to Anakin), and is certainly of questionable acceptability in this regard. It is, however, perfectly understandable: ::Topicalization in flat constituency and dependency structures The upper two trees show the analysis using flat constituency-based structures that lack a finite VP constituent, and the lower two trees are dependency-based,See Mel'čuk (2003: 221) and Starosta (2003: 278) for dependency grammar analyses of topicalization similar to the ones shown here. whereby dependency inherently rejects the existence of finite VP- constituents.Concerning the rejection of a finite VP constituent in dependency grammar, see Tesnière (1959:16ff.). The noteworthy aspect of these examples is that topicalization does not result in a discontinuity, since there are no crossing lines in the trees. What this means is that such cases can be analyzed purely in terms of inversion. The topicalized expression simply \\"inverts\\" to the other side of its head.See Groß and Osborne (2009:64-66) for such an analysis. Instead of the flat trees just examined, most constituency grammars posit more layered structures that include a finite VP constituent. These more layered structures are likely to address topicalization in terms of movement or copying, as illustrated with the following two trees:See for instance Grewendorf (1988:66ff.), Ouhalla (1998: 136f.), Radford (2004: 123ff). ::Topicalization in layered constituency structures Tree a. shows the canonical word order again, and tree b. illustrates what is known as the movement or copying analysis. The topicalized expression is first generated in its canonical position but is then copied to the front of the sentence, the original then being deleted. The movement analysis of discontinuities is one possible way to address those instances of topicalization that cannot be explained in terms of inversion. An alternative explanation is feature passing. One assumes that the topicalized expression is not moved or copied to the clause-initial position, but rather it is \\"base\\" generated there. Instead of movement, there is feature passing, however.See for instance the account of functional uncertainty in Lexical Functional Grammar (Bresnan 2001:64-69). A link of a sort is established between the topicalized expression and its governor. The link is the path along which information about the topicalized expression is passed to the governor of that expression. A piece of Yoda wisdom is again used for illustration, the full sentence being Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin: ::Feature passing (constituency and dependency) The nodes in red mark the path of feature passing. Features (=information) about the topicalized expression are passed rightward through (and down) the tree structure to the governor of that expression. This path is present in both analyses, i.e. in the constituency-based a-analysis on the left and in the dependency-based b-analysis on the right. Since topicalization can occur over long distances, feature passing must also occur over long distances. The final example shows a dependency-based analysis of a sentence where the feature passing path is quite long: ::Long distance feature passing (dependency) Information about the topicalized such nonsense is passed along the path marked in red down to the governor of the topicalized expression spouting. The words corresponding to the nodes in red form a catena (Latin for 'chain', plural catenae).See Osborne et al. (2013) concerning catenae. A theory of topicalization is then built up in part by examining the nature of these catenae for feature passing.

Adam Smith's account of primitive-original accumulation depicted a peaceful process, in which some workers laboured more diligently than others and gradually built up wealth, eventually leaving the less diligent workers to accept living wages for their labour.David Harvey, class 12, time range 20:00–22:00 Karl Marx rejected this explanation as \\"childishness\\", instead stating that, in the words of David Harvey, primitive accumulation \\"entailed taking land, say, enclosing it, and expelling a resident population to create a landless proletariat, and then releasing the land into the privatised mainstream of capital accumulation\\". This would be accomplished through violence, war, enslavement, and colonialism. Naming and translations The concept was initially referred to in various different ways, and the expression of an \\"accumulation\\" at the origin of capitalism began to appear with Adam Smith. Smith, writing The Wealth of Nations in his native English, spoke of a \\"previous\\" accumulation;Karl Marx's Capital, vol I Ch. 26, states \\"The whole movement, therefore, seems to turn in a vicious circle, out of which we can only get by supposing a primitive accumulation (previous accumulation of Adam Smith) preceding capitalistic accumulation; an accumulation not the result of the capitalistic mode of production, but its starting point.\\" referring to Adam Smith's Wealth, Bk II introduction, \\"This accumulation must, evidently, be previous to his applying his industry for so long a time to such a peculiar business.\\" Karl Marx, writing Das Kapital in German, reprised Smith's expression, by translating it to German as (\\"original, initial\\"); Marx's translators, in turn, rendered it into English as primitive. James Steuart, with his 1767 work, is considered by some scholars as the greatest classical theorist of primitive accumulation.Perelman, p. 170 (ch. 7) The myths of political economy In disinterring the origins of capital, Marx felt the need to dispel what he felt were religious myths and fairy-tales about the origins of capitalism. Marx wrote: What has to be explained is how the capitalist relations of production are historically established. In other words, how it comes about that means of production get to be privately owned and traded in, and how the capitalists can find workers on the labor market ready and willing to work for them, because they have no other means of livelihood; also referred to as the \\"Reserve Army of Labor.\\" The link between primitive accumulation and colonialism At the same time as local obstacles to investment in manufactures are being overcome, and a unified national market is developing with a nationalist ideology, Marx sees a strong impulse to business development coming from world trade: Primitive accumulation and privatization According to Marx, the whole purpose of primitive accumulation is to privatize the means of production, so that the exploiting owners can make money from the surplus labour of those who, lacking other means, must work for them. Marx says that primitive accumulation means the expropriation of the direct producers, and more specifically \\"the dissolution of private property based on the labor of its owner... Self-earned private property, that is based, so to say, on the fusing together of the isolated, independent laboring-individual with the conditions of his labor, is supplanted by capitalistic private property, which rests on exploitation of the nominally free labor of others, i.e., on wage-labor\\" (emphasis added). The social relations of capitalism In the last chapter of Capital, Volume I, Marx described the social conditions he thought necessary for capitalism with a comment about Edward Gibbon Wakefield's theory of colonization: This is indicative of Marx's more general fascination with settler colonialism, and his interest in how \\"free\\" lands—or, more accurately, lands seized from indigenous people—could disrupt capitalist social relations. Ongoing primitive accumulation \\"Orthodox\\" Marxists see primitive accumulation as something that happened in the late Middle Ages and finished long ago, when capitalist industry started. They see primitive accumulation as a process happening in the transition from the feudal \\"stage\\" to the capitalist \\"stage\\". However, this can be seen as a misrepresentation of both Marx's ideas and historical reality, since feudal-type economies exist in various parts of the world, even in the 21st century. Marx's story of primitive accumulation is best seen as a special case of the general principle of capitalist market expansion. In part, trade grows incrementally, but usually the establishment of capitalist relations of production involves force and violence; transforming property relations means that assets previously owned by some people are no longer owned by them, but by other people, and making people part with their assets in this way involves coercion. This is an ongoing process of expropriation, Proletarianization and Urbanization. In his preface to Das Kapital Vol. 1, Marx compares the situation of England and Germany and points out that less developed countries also face a process of primitive accumulation. Marx comments that \\"if, however, the German reader shrugs his shoulders at the condition of the English industrial and agricultural labourers, or in optimist fashion comforts himself with the thought that in Germany things are not nearly so bad, I must plainly tell him, \\" (the tale is told of you!)\\". Marx was referring here to the expansion of the capitalist mode of production (not the expansion of world trade), through expropriation processes. He continues, \\"Intrinsically, it is not a question of the higher or lower degree of development of the social antagonism that results from the natural laws of capitalist production. It is a question of these laws themselves, of these tendencies working with iron necessity towards inevitable results. The country that is more developed industrially only shows, to the less developed, the image of its own future\\"  David Harvey's theory of accumulation by dispossession  David Harvey expands the concept of \\"primitive accumulation\\" to create a new concept, \\"accumulation by dispossession\\", in his 2003 book, The New Imperialism. Like Mandel, Harvey claims that the word \\"primitive\\" leads to a misunderstanding in the history of capitalism: that the original, \\"primitive\\" phase of capitalism is somehow a transitory phase that need not be repeated once commenced. Instead, Harvey maintains that primitive accumulation (\\"accumulation by dispossession\\") is a continuing process within the process of capital accumulation on a world scale. Because the central Marxian notion of crisis via \\"over-accumulation\\" is assumed to be a constant factor in the process of capital accumulation, the process of \\"accumulation by dispossession\\" acts as a possible safety valve that may temporarily ease the crisis. This is achieved by simply lowering the prices of consumer commodities (thus pushing up the propensity for general consumption), which in turn is made possible by the considerable reduction in the price of production inputs. Should the magnitude of the reduction in the price of inputs outweigh the reduction in the price of consumer goods, it can be said that the rate of profit will, for the time being, increase. Thus: Harvey's theoretical extension encompasses more recent economic dimensions such as intellectual property rights, privatization, and predation and exploitation of nature and folk lore. Privatization of public services puts enormous profit into capitalists' hands. If it belonged to the public sector, that profit would not have existed. In that sense, the profit is created by dispossession of peoples or nations. Destructive industrial use of the environment is similar because the environment \\"naturally\\" belongs to everyone, or to no one: factually, it \\"belongs\\" to whoever lives there. Multinational pharmaceutical companies collect information about how herb or other natural medicine is used among natives in less-developed country, do some R&D; to find the material that make those natural medicines effective, and patent the findings. By doing so, multinational pharmaceutical companies can now sell the medicine to the natives who are the original source of the knowledge that made production of medicine possible. That is, dispossession of folklore (knowledge, wisdom, practice) through intellectual property rights. David Harvey also argues that accumulation by dispossession is a temporal or partial solution to over-accumulation. Because accumulation by dispossession makes raw materials cheaper, the profit rate can at least temporarily go up. Harvey's interpretation has been criticized by Brass, who disputes the view that what is described as present-day primitive accumulation, or accumulation by dispossession, entails proletarianization. Because the latter is equated by Harvey with the separation of the direct producer (mostly smallholders) from the means of production (land), Harvey assumes this results in the formation of a workforce that is free. By contrast, Brass points out that in many instances the process of depeasantization leads to workers who are unfree, because they are unable personally to commodify or recommodify their labour- power, by selling it to the highest bidder. Schumpeter's critique of Marx's theory The economist Joseph Schumpeter disagreed with the Marxist explanation of the origin of capital, because Schumpeter did not believe in exploitation. In liberal economic theory, the market returns to each person the exact value she added into it; capitalists are just people who are very adept at saving and whose contributions are especially magnificent, and they do not take anything away from other people or the environment. Liberals believe that capitalism has no internal flaws or contradictions; only outside threats. To liberals, the idea of the necessity of violent primitive accumulation to capital is particularly incendiary. Schumpeter wrote rather testily: Schumpeter argued that imperialism was not a necessary jump-start for capitalism, nor is it needed to bolster capitalism, because imperialism pre- existed capitalism. Schumpeter believed that, whatever the empirical evidence, capitalist world trade could in principle just expand peacefully. If imperialism occurred, Schumpeter asserted, it has nothing to do with the intrinsic nature of capitalism itself, or with capitalist market expansion. The distinction between Schumpeter and Marx here is subtle. Marx claimed that capitalism requires violence and imperialism—first, to kick-start capitalism with a pile of booty and to dispossess a population to induce them to enter into capitalist relations as workers, and then to surmount the otherwise-fatal contradictions generated within capitalist relations over time. Schumpeter's view was that imperialism is an atavistic impulse pursued by a state independent of the interests of the economic ruling class.

New Jersey, 437 U.S. 617 (1978), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that states could not discriminate against another state's articles of commerce. Background On account of its location wedged between New York City and Philadelphia (the two largest cities on the East Coast of the United States), New Jersey has long been a heavily industrialized state, frequently containing factories and other facilities for businesses centered in or servicing the major cities nearby; as well as in the state. Among the facilities developed in New Jersey was waste processing, including both toxic waste and regular municipal-waste landfills. Municipalities and businesses outside New Jersey made such extensive use of the state's waste-processing facilities that in 1973, the New Jersey Legislature passed a Waste Control Act (N.J.S.A. § 13 et seq.) prohibiting the importation of most \\"solid or liquid waste which originated or was collected outside the territorial limits of the State.\\" Subsequent to the passage of the Act, the City of Philadelphia, whose municipal waste was delivered in part to landfills and other waste-processing facilities in New Jersey, filed suit against the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection in the Chancery Division of the New Jersey Superior Court, seeking an injunction against enforcement of the Waste Control Act on the grounds that it was unconstitutional. The New Jersey Supreme Court, however, found that the law advanced vital health and environmental objectives with no economic discrimination against, and with little burden upon, interstate commerce. It therefore found it permissible under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. The plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States.  Opinion of the Court  On appeal, the U.S. Supreme Court found the New Jersey Waste Control Act unconstitutional because it violated the Dormant Commerce Clause and reversed the New Jersey Supreme Court's decision. In writing for the majority, Justice Stewart concluded that > whatever New Jersey's ultimate purpose, it may not be accomplished by > discriminating against articles of commerce coming from outside the State > unless there is some reason, apart from their origin, to treat them > differently. Furthermore, the court held that legitimate local interests which had incidental interstate effects were within the state's general police powers, but \\"where simple economic protectionism is effected by state legislation, a virtually per se rule of invalidity has been erected\\".. = Dissent = Justice Rehnquist, joined by Justice Burger, maintained that the law was constitutional, on the basis of the validity of quarantine laws. Rehnquist reasoned that the toxic trash New Jersey handled from out-of-state was no different from diseased meat and germ-infected rags that were legally prohibited in quarantine laws. > The physical fact of life that New Jersey must somehow dispose of its own > noxious items does not mean that it must serve as a depository for those of > every other state. Because states can rightfully burden interstate commerce in the name of health and safety, Rehnquist found no hindrance to this law in the Commerce Clause.

Mason's marks on the Canton Viaduct. Mason's marks above engravings on Brunnenturm's portal in Zürich A mason's mark is a symbol often found on dressed stone in buildings and other public structures. In stonemasonry Regulations issued in Scotland in 1598 by James VI's Master of Works, William Schaw, stated that on admission to the guild, every mason had to enter his name and his mark in a register. There are three types of marks used by stonemasons. # Banker marks were made on stones before they were sent to be used by the walling masons. These marks served to identify the banker mason who had prepared the stones to their paymaster. This system was employed only when the stone was paid for by measure, rather than by time worked. For example, the 1306 contract between Richard of Stow, mason, and the Dean and Chapter of Lincoln Cathedral, specified that the plain walling would be paid for by measure, and indeed banker marks are found on the blocks of walling in this cathedral. Conversely, the masons responsible for walling the eastern parts of Exeter Cathedral were paid by the week, and consequently few banker marks are found on this part of the cathedral. Banker marks make up the majority of masons' marks, and are generally what are meant when the term is used without further specification. # Assembly marks were used to ensure the correct installation of important pieces of stonework. For example, the stones on the window jambs in the chancel of North Luffenham church in Rutland are each marked with a Roman numeral, directing the order in which the stones were to be installed. # Quarry stones were used to identify the source of a stone, or occasionally the quality. In Freemasonry Freemasonry, a fraternal order that uses an analogy to stonemasonry for much of its structure, also makes use of marks. A Freemason who takes the degree of Mark Master Mason will be asked to create his own Mark, as a type of unique signature or identifying badge. Some of these can be quite elaborate.

That agreement, which was (relative to modern agreements) highly restrictive at the insistence of the British negotiators who feared that \\"giving in\\" to US demands for a \\"free-for-all\\" would lead to the then financially superior US airlines' total domination of the global air transport industry, was the world's first bilateral air services agreement.

Historical background In July 1976, Edmund Dell, the then new UK Secretary of State for Trade, renounced the original Bermuda Agreement of 1946 and initiated bilateral negotiations with his US counterparts on a new air services agreement, which resulted in the Bermuda II treaty of 1977.Britain to end Bermuda Agreement Flight International 3 July 1976 page 4 The reason for this was that there was no provision in the original 1946 Bermuda agreement that would have allowed British Caledonian (BCal), then the UK's foremost wholly privately owned, independent international scheduled airline, to use the licences the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) had awarded it in 1972 to begin daily scheduled services from its London Gatwick base to Houston and Atlanta. (These cities were not nominated as \\"gateway cities\\" in the original Bermuda agreement.)

The latter's US traffic rights were withdrawn in the aftermath of the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis.) Similarly, Air New Zealand was allowed to continue using its fifth freedom rights between London and Los Angeles. The extensive fifth freedom rights US carriers used to enjoy from the UK to other European countries were restricted to a few routes from London Heathrow to what used to be West Germany (including West Berlin) in the days prior to German reunification. In the early 1990s, United Airlines used to fly between Heathrow, Berlin, Hamburg and Munich (United had acquired these traffic rights along with Pan Am's transatlantic rights to/from Heathrow for US$1billion in 1990). A few years earlier, Trans World Airlines flew between London and Brussels but, unlike United, did not have traffic rights to carry local traffic between the two cities. American and British regulatory authorities needed to approve every airline's capacity and pricing ahead of each operating season. Each country could refuse traffic rights to a carrier it was not satisfied with, particularly with regard to ownership and/or control. Only a specified number of US \\"gateway cities\\" could be served by both UK and US carriers from London Heathrow as well as London Gatwick. Only the following US gateway cities could be served non-stop from Heathrow: Baltimore, Boston, Chicago O'Hare, Detroit, Los Angeles, Miami, New York JFK, Newark, Anchorage, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington-Dulles. Anchorage and Minneapolis/St. Paul, held dormant authorities to use Heathrow as their London terminal, grandfathered from use during the original Bermuda Agreement; but could only be operated non-stop by a British carrier. As such, Anchorage remained dormant during the latter years of Bermuda II, and Minneapolis featured service only to London Gatwick, as its operating carrier (Northwest Airlines) did not have the authority to operate into Heathrow. Other airports in the United States had to be served from Gatwick rather than Heathrow: these eventually included Atlanta, Cincinnati, Cleveland, New Orleans, Pittsburgh, Dallas/Fort Worth, Houston, Las Vegas, Nashville, Orlando, Tampa, Raleigh/Durham, St Louis and Charlotte. A provision existed that allowed any Heathrow-authorised British carrier operating as the sole carrier between London Gatwick and any US city to switch that service to Heathrow as long as the incumbent airline had demonstrated its ability to carry a minimum of 300,000 non-stop passengers (both transfer and point-to-point) between that city and London, and vice versa, over a period of two consecutive calendar years. Using this method, BA was able to transfer Denver, San Diego and Phoenix services from Gatwick to Heathrow in 2002. Bermuda II continued and expanded the principle of \\"dual designation\\", i.e. the right to designate two UK airlines as well as two US carriers as \\"flag carriers\\" on the same routes, which already existed on the London–New York and London–Los Angeles routes under the original Bermuda treaty. Under the new agreement, BCal had its licences to commence scheduled services from its Gatwick base to both Houston and Atlanta confirmed and was designated as the UK's exclusive flag carrier on both routes. It also obtained a licence and sole UK flag carrier status to commence scheduled services from Gatwick to Dallas/Fort Worth. In addition, BCal obtained a licence and sole UK flag carrier status to commence scheduled all cargo flights between Gatwick and Houston – including an optional stop- over at Manchester or Prestwick in either direction. The UK Government chose to designate Laker Airways rather than BCal as the second UK flag carrier to New York to enable that airline to inaugurate its long-planned \\"Skytrain\\" operation on that route. Moreover, both sides agreed to continue dual designation, i.e. designating two UK flag carriers as well as two US flag carriers, on the London–New York and London–Los Angeles routes. The principle of dual designation was extended to another two high-volume routes. The UK side chose to designate a second carrier on London–Miami, while the US side chose London–Boston for the same purpose. This meant that a second British airline was permitted to commence scheduled services on the former route, whereas another American carrier could do the same on the latter route. The UK government chose to designate Laker Airways as the second UK flag carrier on the Los Angeles and Miami routes, whilst the US government decided to designate Northwest as the second US flag carrier on London–Boston. (Pan Am and TWA continued in their role as the two designated US flag carriers between London and New York as well as London and Los Angeles respectively.) Braniff Boeing 747 at London Gatwick in 1981. Braniff was among the US carriers using Gatwick instead of Heathrow for its London services under the terms of the Bermuda II air agreement. Between 1978 and 1982, it operated daily into Gatwick from Dallas/Fort Worth. During the Bermuda II negotiations, the UK side succeeded in having inserted into the new air services agreement a clause stating that Gatwick – rather than Heathrow – was to be nominated as the designated US flag carrier's London gateway airport whenever BCal was going to be the sole designated UK flag carrier on the same route. This clause was meant to support the growth of BCal's scheduled operation at Gatwick as well as to redress the competitive imbalance between it and its much bigger, more powerful rivals. The UK side furthermore succeeded in negotiating a three-year \\"exclusivity\\" period for the incumbent operator on any new route with their US counterparts. For Gatwick-based BCal this meant that it did not have to face any competitor that was using Heathrow, a more accessible airport with a bigger catchment area and a far greater number of passengers connecting between flights, on any of the new routes it was planning to launch to the US. It also meant that it had any new route to the US completely to itself for the first three years of operation, which most airline industry analysts reckon is sufficiently long for a brand-new scheduled air service to become profitable. At British insistence Bermuda II furthermore contained clauses that made it illegal for any airline operating scheduled flights between the UK and the US to resort to predatory pricing or capacity dumping. Air fares were only approved if they reflected the actual cost of providing these services. Similarly, capacity increases were sanctioned on a reciprocal basis only. The reason for insisting on the inclusion of these provisions in the Bermuda II agreement was to prevent the much bigger, better financed and commercially far more aggressive US carriers from undercutting BCal with \\"loss-leading\\" fares cross-subsidised with profits those carriers' vast domestic networks generated as well as to stop them from \\"marginalising\\" the UK carrier by adding capacity far in excess of what the market could sustain. Bermuda II also provided routing restrictions for flights between the United States and various British overseas colonies including Bermuda, various Caribbean islands and Hong Kong. 1981 revision Both sides agreed to automatically nominate Gatwick as the gateway airport for London for any London–US route that did not already exist under the original 1946 Bermuda agreement. When all available routes between London Heathrow/Gatwick and the US were taken, any carrier wishing to start a new route to a US gateway city not served from either of London's two main airports at the time of application for route authority needed to drop another route. In addition, any such change could only become effective when there was unanimous agreement between both the UK and US governments. Failure of both nations' governments to agree to such changes prevented the introduction of additional non-stop flights, including between London and Honolulu, Portland (OR), and Salt Lake City. British Airways did successfully gain approval in 1982 to operate nonstop to New Orleans from Gatwick, as an intermediate stop on its Lockheed L-1011 TriStar service to Mexico City. This gateway was later omitted as the performance capability of newer Boeing 747s allowed the airline to operate the round trip route nonstop, despite the Mexican city's high altitude. 1991 revision In the wake of the bankruptcies of TWA and Pan Am, the carriers authorized to operate Heathrow routes were replaced by British Airways and Virgin Atlantic on the UK side and American Airlines and United Airlines on the US side. Pan Am had previously sold its Heathrow traffic rights to United Airlines, but British negotiators initially stated that they would not allow United to receive the transferred route authority citing Bermuda II's specific designation of Pan Am; they furthermore stated that United was not a successor airline because it was not assuming ownership of Pan Am. Virgin Atlantic's access rights to Heathrow under Bermuda II derived from the fact that the UK was not using its entitlement to nominate a second carrier to match the two US carriers' presence at London's premier airport. The UK Government therefore took advantage of the abolition of the London [Air] Traffic Distribution Rules, which had confined Virgin's London operations to Gatwick, as well as of the US Government's intention to have American and United replace TWA and Pan Am as the designated US flag carriers at Heathrow to help Virgin establish a presence at that airport as well. These access restrictions were also the reason BA (as BCal's legal heir between London and Houston, Dallas, and Atlanta) and American (as Braniff Airways's legal heir between Dallas and London) were compelled to continue using Gatwick as their UK gateway for all non-stop scheduled operations between London and Houston, Dallas, and Atlanta as long as Bermuda II remained in force. Code sharing also became possible under the 1991 agreement. The US later approved Continental Airlines to fly to London Heathrow, but British refusal to endorse the US position prevented Continental from exercising this route authority. However, Continental succeeded in obtaining UK permission to enter into a codeshare agreement with Virgin Atlantic, which placed Continental's flight numbers in addition to Virgin's on some of the latter's Heathrow and Gatwick flights. 1995 revision Fare and route restrictions governing all scheduled air services serving airports other than London Heathrow or London Gatwick were lifted. (This partial liberalisation came about as a UK concession to the US to help BA gain approval for its code-share alliance with US Air. As a result, access restrictions that originally covered all London airports were lifted at Luton and Stansted. This, in turn, enabled the now defunct \\"new generation\\", all-business class carriers such as Eos, Maxjet and Silverjet to enter the lucrative London–New York business travel market by choosing Stansted and Luton rather than Heathrow or Gatwick as their UK departure/arrival airports). Continental Airlines also took advantage of this liberalisation by starting service to a number of important regional UK airports, including Bristol, Birmingham, Manchester, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Belfast. Continental furthermore introduced non-stop service to Stansted from Newark in 2001, but this was withdrawn in the industry downturn after the September 11 terrorist attacks. 1997 revision Flights between the United States and Hong Kong were removed from the scope of Bermuda II in 1997, when sovereignty over Hong Kong was transferred to the People's Republic of China. Aftermath Liberalisation of the Bermuda II agreement was the declared intention of both countries since 1995. However, bilateral negotiations between the UK and the US were unsuccessful. Subsequently, matters were complicated by the European Court of Justice's judgment to declare all bilateral agreements between individual EU member states and the US illegal. Such agreements were deemed to violate the EU's Common Aviation Market. The main sticking point that had prevented the conclusion of a new, transatlantic Common Aviation Area agreement between the EU and the US was that the UK and most other European countries viewed the US version of open skies as too restrictive. The US open skies template denied foreign airlines cabotage rights, i.e. the right to operate wholly within the US domestic market without entering into a code-share agreement with a US carrier. It also denied foreign airlines the right to acquire stakes in their US counterparts with the intention of exercising boardroom control. On 2 March 2007 a draft agreementEUR Lex - 52006PC0169(02) was reached by negotiators from the European Commission and the US that proposed to drop Bermuda II's restrictions preventing US flag carriers, other than American and United, from flying to Heathrow.Bloomberg.com: U.S This new Air Transport Agreement between the EU and the US was approved unanimously by the EU Transport Council on 22 March 2007European Commission - Transport: Air Portal and replaced Bermuda II with effect from 30 March 2008. It also paved the way for either country to allow airlines headquartered in other EU countries to enter the UK-US air transport market. On 3 October 2007, Britain concluded its first fully liberal open skies agreement with Singapore, allowing Singapore Airlines to fly completely unrestricted from any point in the United Kingdom, including Heathrow, to any other destination, including the United States and domestic destinations, effective 30 March 2008.Singapore, UK conclude landmark Open Skies Agreement ChannelNewsAsia 3 October 2007 References External links *Bermuda II, Full Agreement in PDF Category:1977 in the United Kingdom Category:1977 in the United States Category:Aviation agreements Category:1977 in aviation Category:History of Heathrow Airport Category:Treaties concluded in 1977 Category:United Kingdom–United States treaties ","title":"Bermuda II Agreement"},{"id":"2139929","text":"Stu is a masculine given name or nickname, usually a shortened form (hypocorism) of Stuart or Stewart.

He played college football at the University of Oklahoma and won the Heisman Trophy in 1952. Vessels went on to play professional football with the National Football League's Baltimore Colts and the Western Interprovincial Football Union's Edmonton Eskimos. College football career Vessels led the Oklahoma Sooners to the national championship in 1950, scoring 15 touchdowns. In 1952, he won the Heisman Trophy. Playing under the legendary Bud Wilkinson, he became the first of seven Sooners, followed by Steve Owens (1969), Billy Sims (1978), Jason White (2003), Sam Bradford (2008), Baker Mayfield (2017), and Kyler Murray (2018) to win the award. During the 1952 season he rushed for 1,072 yards including seven 100 yard performances, and 17 touchdowns. These achievements led to his induction into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1974. He was also a member of the Sigma Nu fraternity at the University of Oklahoma, along with being a member of the Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps. Professional football career Vessels was the first pick of the Baltimore Colts in the first round of the 1953 NFL Draft, but did not join the Colts following the draft, electing instead to play with the Edmonton Eskimos of the then Western Interprovincial Football Union. During his rookie season in 1953, Vessels led the WIFU, the forerunner of the CFL Western Conference (later changed to Division) in rushing with 926 yards on 129 carries and with eight rushing touchdowns. He caught 20 passes for 310 yards and with one touchdown. Vessels also passed 393 yards on 30 attempts with 18 completions and 4 touchdown passes to having thrown only one interception and while on defence he snagged four interceptions. Vessels became the first player to win the Schenley Award as the Canadian Rugby- Football Union's (CRU) Most Outstanding Player (the CFL did not come into existence until 1958). Vessels played only the one season in Canada. In 1956, he joined the NFL's Baltimore Colts, the team that had drafted him three years prior. That season, his only for the Colts, he had 11 receptions for 177 yards and a touchdown plus returned 16 kickoffs for 379 yards. Unfortunately, Vessels' professional career in the NFL was cut short by a leg injury. Later life Billy Vessels statue in Heisman Park at Memorial Stadium Norman, OK After his football career, Vessels was employed for many years by The Mackle Company, one of Florida's leading developers. In the 1970s, he became involved in horse breeding and served on the Florida Pari-Mutuel Commission from 1976 to 1983, becoming its executive director. He was elected president of the National Association of State Racing Commissions in 1984 and served as director of the Florida division of Pari-Mutuel Wagering from 1987 to 1989. Honors In September 2003, Cleveland, Oklahoma renamed its high school football stadium \\"Billy Vessels Memorial Stadium\\" in honor of Vessels.

The MNJ consists of of track in southeastern New York serving Orange County and the Hudson Valley. The railroad also operates and has trackage rights on three additional branch lines (the Hudson Secondary, Maybrook and Walden Industrials, and Southern Tier) totalling leased from Norfolk Southern in Orange County. It was known as the Middletown and New Jersey Railway until 2009, when East Penn Railroad parent Regional Rail, LLC bought the line through a new subsidiary. In 2015, Regional Rail was in turn acquired by Levine Leichtman Capital Partners (“LLCP”). In 2012, The Middletown and New Jersey Railroad, LLC received a $1.6 million New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) grant to perform rail upgrades on the four lines it operates in Orange County. The railroad rehabilitated the line between Campbell Hall and Warwick and portions of the track in Middletown and between Walden and Montgomery. History and Predecessors =New York & Erie Railroad= The first railroad to reach Middletown was the New York and Erie Railroad, a predecessor of the Erie Railroad, which reached the hamlet on June 1, 1843 and remained the only railroad in the immediate region for over two decades. In the early 1840s, the NY&E; fostered the growth of the Orange County dairy industry by developing the capacity to ship fluid milk to New York City without spoilage. This development provided the area's dairy farmers, who had hitherto been limited to the shipment of butter, with a far more profitable business opportunity. Furthermore, by greatly accelerating the expansion of Orange County's dairy industry, this development helped foster the creation of a number of small railroads in southeast New York State including the predecessor of the Middletown and New Jersey, the Middletown, Unionville and Water Gap Railroad. The NY&E; was reorganized as the Erie Railroad on April 30, 1861. =Middletown, Unionville and Water Gap Railroad= In 1866, public meetings were held in Middletown, Westtown and Unionville, New York to discuss the viability of a railroad via these hamlets to Deckertown, Sussex County, New Jersey. A route was surveyed from there to Middletown, but, as built, the Middletown, Unionville and Water Gap Railroad only extended from a connection with the NY&E; in Middletown to Unionville, which was reached on December 6, 1867, after fourteen months of construction. Freight cars received from the Erie made the trip to Unionville starting January 13, 1868. The MU&WG; was built to the broad gauge of the Erie. The road was leased to the Erie and commenced regular operations as the Erie's \\"Unionville Branch\\" on May 15, 1868. =New York and Oswego Midland Railroad= On January 11, 1866, the New York and Oswego Midland Railroad was incorporated with the goal of linking Oswego, New York, on Lake Ontario, with the Hudson River at a point across from New York City. The NY&OM; reached Middletown in 1871 and hoped to connect with three New Jersey companies to form a through route to New York Harbor. The three New Jersey roads merged in 1870 to form the New Jersey Midland Railroad, which built west in 1871 from Two Bridges (Beaver Lake) to the New Jersey/New York state line at Hanford, just south of Unionville. The link between the NY&OM; and the NJM would be the MU&WG; which was leased by the NY&OM; effective April 1, 1872. The MU&WG; was standard-gauged, and the NY&OM; built just over of track to bridge the MU&WG; over the Erie and connect it to the NY&OM; at East Main Street, Middletown. The NY&OM; soon entered bankruptcy and dropped the lease on the MU&WG; which was then leased by the NJM in 1873. =New York, Susquehanna and Western Railroad= The NJM reorganized into the Midland Railroad of New Jersey in 1880 and in 1881 merged with several other roads to form the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railroad. Meanwhile, the NY&OM; reorganized as the New York, Ontario and Western in 1879, and the Erie reorganized as the New York, Lake Erie & Western in 1878. The MU&WG; wound up in a very favorable situation with connections to three major carriers, the NYLE&W; (Erie) and O&W; in Middletown and the NYS&W; at Hanford. This offered the MU&WG;'s shippers the choice of multiple freight routings and enabled the shortline to gain better freight rates and a bigger share of the revenue by having the big carriers compete for its traffic. This advantage continued for decades and was enjoyed by its successors, the M&U; and the M&NJ;, until the late 1950s. =Erie Railroad again in control= The MU&WG; was the west end of the NYS&W; until the NYS&W; built west in 1882 from Two Bridges to Gravel Place, near Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, to gain a link to the anthracite fields via a connection with the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western. The MU&WG; then functioned as the NYS&W;'s Middletown Branch. In 1898, the Erie Railroad, successor to the NYLE&W; in 1895, gained control of the NYS&W; and thus gained control of the MU&WG; for the second time. The MU&WG; was a very desirable property because of the tremendous milk traffic it originated, possibly the greatest in the United States at that time on a mile for mile basis. Milk was shipped to the New York metropolitan region via all three of the MU&WG;'s connections. Creameries and condenseries were built along the route at Pounds Station (just south of Middletown), Slate Hill, Johnson, Westtown and Unionville. =Middletown and Unionville Railroad= The MU&WG; was taken over by the bondholders of its two mortgages on September 8, 1913 because the Erie failed to pay the interest on the bonds. The bondholders organized an independent shortline, the Middletown and Unionville Railroad, which began operations on December 1, 1913 under Vice President and General Manager J. A. Smith. The road enjoyed the revenues from its heavy milk traffic, fluid and condensed, as well as related commodities such as livestock, feed, bottles and coal for the powerhouses. =Middletown and New Jersey Railroad= The M&U; was sold at a foreclosure sale on January 15, 1947 to the three feed dealers, Manning, Simmons and Clark, who reorganized the company as the Middletown and New Jersey Railway Company, Inc. on October 1, 1947. Traffic in the 1950s was dominated by a large GLF feed mill near Dolson Ave. in Middletown. By the mid-1950s, the three owners had died and the railroad was sold around 1956 to John Manning and Marc Suffern. Decline in traffic and revival A substantial passenger service, often using railbuses, was offered with emphasis on carrying high school students from hamlets along the line to Middletown High School. Construction of a new high school far from the tracks resulted in cancellation of the school district's contract and the Middletown and Unionville abolished passenger service with the end of the school year in June 1940. A multi-year, see-saw battle with truck competition ended with the final shipment of milk on August 18, 1941 from Borden at Johnson. Between 1938 and 1942, the NYS&W;, newly independent from Erie control, and the O&W; developed a very close relationship, reminiscent of the \\"Midland Route\\" of an earlier era, and for a short period routed heavy coal traffic from the O&W; to the NYS&W; via the M&U;, once again serving as the link between the two. In the late 1950s the M&NJ; lost two of its three connections as the O&W; ceased operations on March 29, 1957 and the NYS&W; abandoned its Hanford Branch the next year. On February 20, 1960, the railroad was sold to three partners, Jay Wulfson, Jim Wright and Pierre Rasmussen. The GLF mill at Dolson Ave. burned down on March 30, 1962 but was rebuilt as a much larger facility including a custom mix plant and a bulk plant with an annual capacity of 50,000 tons. GLF soon merged into Agway. The complex received as many as a dozen loads daily. In the early 1960s, the Empire State Railway Museum ran diesel and steam excursions over the line until relocating to Essex, Connecticut, in the mid-1960s. The ESRM has returned to New York but is now located on the Catskill Mountain Railroad in Phoenicia, New York. Service on the south end of the line was cut back about to Johnson with the last run to Unionville on December 31, 1968. Within two years service was cut back two more miles to Slate Hill. Agway opened a fertilizer plant near Dolson Ave. in 1966; Balchem opened a chemical plant in an old creamery in Slate Hill in 1968 and Polytherm Plastics (now Genpak) constructed a plant in Middletown in 1969 to produce plastic plates and dishes. These three customers were the only customers in the late 1980s and through the 1990s as the Agway feed mill at Dolson Ave. closed in the mid-1980s. Agway Fertilizer closed in June 2000 and Balchem ended rail service soon after. Pete Rasmussen became majority owner and President/General Manager of the railroad when Wulfson left to start up the Vermont Railway in the mid-1960s and sold his stock to Rasmussen. Upon President and General Manager Pierre \\"Pete\\" Rasmussen's death in 2004, his wife, Lucy, as administratrix of his estate, ran the railroad. In December 2005, Chartwell International of Morristown, New Jersey signed an agreement with the Rasmussen estate to purchase majority control of the Cranberry Creek Railroad, holding company for the Middletown & New Jersey. In February 2006, Chartwell Corp. finished the acquisition of the railroad begun in December 2005, acquiring 100% ownership. The failing Chartwell sold the line to Regional Rail, LLC, headquartered in Kennett Square, Pa and began operations in April 2009. When Regional Rail purchased the rail line it was in deep decline, but with NYS DOT grants and aggressive marketing, the line has made big advances. The old Agway Fertilizer site was converted to an inter-modal and trans-load site and now boasts of 4 regular customers. Commodities include beer, paper, lumber, fertilizer, wheat, barley, salt brine, potatoes and onions and of course its original mainstay plastics and chemicals and the occasional carnival train. The railroad recently leased NS lines that provided much needed additional operating revenue that saved 3 lines from abandonment. The railroad had the only through line connection operating after the mainline devastation after Hurricane Irene in 2011. Some MTA and NS trains were diverted over MNJ trackage and all local and through freight traffic was handled by them and the NYSW via the Campbell Hall cluster and yard. Facilities =Main line= The railway operates of track and interchanges with the Norfolk Southern Railway in Middletown and Campbell Hall, and the New York Susquehanna and Western Railroad in Warwick. A New York State Department of Transportation grant of $750,000 was expected in fall 2007, and an additional $2 million was slated for 2009, to rehabilitate several additional miles of track in order to serve various potential industrial sites. Rehabilitation began in October 2010, after the damage done by hurricane Irene in last August 2011, the MNJ was granted an additional $1.6 million by the state Department of Transportation for storm damage repairs and upgrades. In 2010, the railroad filed a petition with the Surface Transportation Board to lease three branch lines and yards formerly operated by Norfolk Southern Railway. The M&NJ; assumed operations and received trackage rights on the Walden and Maybrook industrials and the Hudson Secondary from Metro-North RR's Southern Tier Line at Campbell Hall to Warwick from Norfolk Southern on October 6, 2010, adding 40 miles of leased lines and trackage rights. =Buildings= The M&NJ;'s offices are located in Middletown, New York in a converted train station originally built in 1872, with an engine shed located immediately behind the station. Nearby is the more-modern engine house that stores the railroad's sole operating GP9 diesel-electric locomotive. Rolling stock The line currently uses its locomotive to pull the rolling stock of other railroads. In the past, it has owned steam and diesel locomotives, as well as boxcars. =Steam locomotives= The railroad and its predecessors would roster a total of eight steam locomotives over the years, all bought second hand and none with a trailing truck. Three of these were camelback locomotives and the wheel arrangements included 4-4-0, 2-6-0, 4-6-0, and 2-8-0. The line's predecessor, the Middletown and Unionville Railroad (M&U;), relied on the nearby New York, Ontario and Western shops for locomotive repairs and inspections and rented fifty-six different O&W; locomotives in thirteen classes while its own was in the O&W; shops. On April 23, 1944, the M&U; retired the last railroad-owned steam locomotive and thereafter leased O&W; locomotives and then NYS&W; 2-10-0 \\"decapod\\" steam locomotives. The M&NJ; purchased former Bath and Hammondsport Railroad 2-6-0 11 in the 1980s with the intent of restoring it for freight service. However it sat stored until 2006 when it was sold to the owner of the Everett Railroad. It is currently undergoing restoration to active service at the shops of the Western Maryland Scenic Railroad. During the 1960s when the Empire State Railway Museum was based out of Middletown, NY locomotive 103, a 2-6-2 from the Sumter & Choctaw Railroad was operated in excursion service between Middletown and Slate Hill, NY as the Middletown & Orange Railroad. This locomotive has since returned to the collection of the Railroad Museum of New England in Thomaston, Connecticut, where it is stored awaiting a possible restoration. =Diesel locomotives= The brand new General Electric 44-ton switcher #1 arrived April 19, 1946. Three of the M&U;'s feed customers had purchased the diesel on behalf of the railroad. The O&W; maintained M&NJ; #1 and loaned its own 44-tonners, 101 and 105, when #1 was in their shop. In 1963, the M&NJ; purchased a second GE 44-tonner (#2) from Calco Chemical of Bound Brook, New Jersey. Engine #2 was the railway's sole operating unit from about 1981 into July 2007. It is now leased to an East Penn customer in Pennsylvania, while the original 44-tonner, now inoperative, is stored and slated for restoration and is in the new engine house. Service is currently provided by a Canadian- built EMD GP9 (formerly Amtrak 773) which arrived in July 2007. The railroad has also leased a GE B30-7 ESPN 7811 and a B23-7 ESPN 5114 from its sister company, East Penn Railroad on October 1, 2010. 44-tonner 1 is currently stored inside the Middletown engine house while #2 was moved to the East Penn operation at Manheim, PA, where it currently operates. =Railroad cars= Because it is a short-line railroad, the M&NJ; does not ordinarily own or lease many railway cars. However, in the late 1970s, the M&NJ; rostered 500 blue boxcars in length leased from NRUC, the National Railway Utilization Company. The cars were loaded with finished goods at Polytherm, then spent much of their time hauling loads in interchange service throughout the U.S. and Canada while the M&NJ; collected 10% of the usage fees they generated. The boom in incentive per diem (IPD) boxcars ended by the early 1980s and the cars returned to the M&NJ; which opened of unused track to store the cars until buyers could be found, a task which took almost a decade.

The show is hosted by All My Children star and ex-Dancing with the Stars participant, Cameron Mathison. It is based on the British reality series Soapstars. I Wanna Be a Soap Star The first season debuted on October 16, 2004. Twelve contestants competed in various acting challenges for the prize of a role on General Hospital. The performances, which involved learning how to cry on camera, filming love scenes and fight scenes, among other soap staples, were judged by film and daytime television actress Debbi Morgan, General Hospital casting director Mark Teschner and agent Michael Bruno. The show underwent some criticism when the winner, Mykel Shannon-Jenkins, was given a role as a police officer named Officer Byron Murphy that barely rose above extra status. His character was later shot and killed by Jesse Beaudry (Matt Marraccini) in July 2005. Contestants for the first season included Maya Gilbert, Brianna Konefall, Alisia Geanopulos, Robyn Hyden, Mykel Shannon Jenkins, Kent Winfrey, Nick Steele, Steve (last name unknown), Jeremy (last name unknown), Michael (last name unknown), Kimberly (last name unknown) and Kelly Thiebaud.  I Wanna Be a Soap Star 2 The second season debuted on June 23, 2005, this time promising a contract role on All My Children. AMC casting director Judy Blye Wilson replaced Teschner as a judge. The show continued to be viewed as innocuous entertainment, but in July 2005 was criticized by Soap Opera Weekly editor Carolyn Hinsey for a segment in which all the contestants were asked difficult questions (on matters such as stem cell research) and the person who gave the least interesting answers was eliminated. Hinsey said soap reporters rarely asked questions on controversial issues and that no actor was ever fired based on giving boring interviews. The second winner of the show was Alec Musser who became the second actor on All My Children to portray Del Henry who was last played by The Bold and the Beautiful star Winsor Harmon from 1994 to 1995. He first aired on August 19, 2005. Contestants for the second season included Toussaint Waterman, Prudence Zdravkovic, Alec Musser, Isaak James, Christina Fandano, Alia Urbanski, Farley Jackson, Nicole (last name unknown), Cathy (last name unknown), Maiesha (last name unknown), Sean (last name unknown) and Joe (last name unknown). I Wanna Be a Soap Star 3 The third season debuted on June 8, 2006, with contestants competing for a contract with One Life to Live. The winner was Mike Jerome who, unlike his predecessors, was out after his thirteen-week contract was up. Third season contestant BethAnn Bonner was offered a contract by the series, and debuted as Talia Sahid on December 21, 2006. Contestants for the third season included Shamika Cotton, BethAnn Bonner, Lauren Ryland, Lindsey Spruill, Mike Jerome, Michael Albanese, Lukas Hassel, Dean Cochran, Ayinde Jones and Kelly McGarry. I Wanna Be a Soap Star 4 The fourth and final season debuted on August 14, 2007, with the winner promised a 13-week contract on Days of Our Lives. Former Days head writer Hogan Sheffer, former star Mary Beth Evans (who portrayed Kayla Johnson) and talent manager Michael Bruno served as judges. Ashlee Holland was named as the winner, and debuted on December 26, 2007 as Crystal Miller. Other contestants for the fourth season included, Jimena Hoyos (runner-up), Monica Thomas, Bo Gorman, Travis Wood, Yves Bright, Joyce Liu, Corey Shelton, Justin Kahn, and Patricia Mizen.

In the American legal system the state can assert power over an individual simply based on the fact that this individual has property (bank account, debt, share of stock, land) in the state. Quasi in rem jurisdiction does not have much function in the United States any longer. However, in very specific cases, quasi in rem jurisdiction can still be effective. A quasi in rem action is commonly used when jurisdiction over the defendant is unobtainable due to their absence from the state. Any judgment will affect only the property seized, as in personam jurisdiction is unobtainable. Of note, in a quasi in rem case the court may lack personal jurisdiction over the defendant, but it has jurisdiction over the defendant's property. The property could be seized to obtain a claim against the defendant. A judgment based on quasi in rem jurisdiction generally affects rights to the property only between the persons involved and does not \\"bind the entire world\\" as does a judgment based on \\"jurisdiction in rem\\". The claim does not have to be related to the property seized, but the person must have minimum contacts with the forum state in order for jurisdiction to be proper.Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U.S. 186, 97 S. Ct. 2569, 53 L. Ed. 2d 683 (1977). On June 24, 1977, in the case of Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U.S. 186, the Supreme Court of the United States decided that the requirement that the circumstances giving rise to jurisdiction comply with the notion of \\"fair play and substantial justice\\" should apply to the quasi in rem jurisdiction questions. The Supreme Court significantly diminished the utility of the quasi in rem jurisdiction because if the case meets the minimum contacts, fair play and substantial justice tests, the action can be brought under the in personam jurisdiction. Quasi in rem jurisdiction, however, can still be an effective option to bring the lawsuit to a particular court because quasi in rem jurisdiction allows litigants to overcome limitations of the long-arm statute of a particular state. There are two types of quasi in rem jurisdiction: 1) quasi in rem type 1 (QIM1); and 2) quasi in rem type 2 (QIM2). In QIM1, a plaintiff sues to secure a pre-existing claim in the subject property. For example, actions that seek quiet title against another's claim to the property. In QIM2, the plaintiff has no pre-existing claim in the subject property. That is, the property rights of the owner are not in dispute, but rather the plaintiff seeks the property so that they may satisfy a separate claim. For example, a person who walks across another's real property and falls into an open pit might have no pre-existing claim regarding the property, but may initiate a QIM2 action to redress his injury.

It ran for two series of six ten-minute episodes. The series was a parody of historical and archaeological documentaries, especially those of the Time Team, Meet the Ancestors and Simon Schama. Marcus Brigstocke played dubious historian David Oxley, who would attempt to 'recreate' a number of historical events in a modern setting. In one episode, he recreated the Viking invasion of Britain in \\"the last bastion of Viking control\\" - an IKEA store. In another, he recreated the Spanish Armada in a swimming pool with children throwing foam balls at one another. Much of the humour derived from Oxley's singular incompetence and stupidity. He seemed totally unaware of the facts of history and often made things up as he went along. Each episode had a general theme that offered a view of history totally at odds with the known facts - such as Camelot being buried underneath Heathrow Airport or the Norman invasion being a bunch of French visitors who overstayed their welcome and got carried away. In every episode, Oxley talked of \\"new evidence unearthed by local enthusiasts\\".

Pique, Brandon Barrett, July 12, 2018. and has released four studio albums since its formation. The band released an album most recently in 2019, though a single was released in 2017, its first new album in almost nine years. Jay Malinowski is the band's lead vocalist, while Eon Sinclair plays bass, and Chuck Treece plays drums. History Eon Sinclair The band's current lineup consists of vocalist and guitarist Jay Malinowski, and bassist Eon Sinclair with Chuck Treece on drums. Patrick Pengelly played drums for the band until 2009. The band met while attending Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. The band released their second album, Sounding a Mosaic, in 2004. The album's single \\"When the Night Feels My Song\\" was the band's breakthrough single on Canadian radio, charting No. 1 on 102.1 The Edge CFNY and gaining airplay on commercial radio stations throughout Canada in the summer of 2005. The band released their follow-up record Street Gospels on August 21, 2007. During the recording of Sounding a Mosaic, Bedouin Soundclash formed a close bond with producer Darryl Jenifer of Bad Brains, with whom they continue to work today. Despite drastic differences in sound, Bedouin Soundclash and Darryl Jenifer are set to release a collaborative Bad Brains vs. Bedouin Soundclash mash-up. Bedouin Soundclash takes its name from a dub record by an artist named Badawi, released on ROIR records in 1996. In an early practice, Malinowski exclaimed it sounded like Bedouin Soundclash, and the name was adopted. In 2006 the band began its own imprint Pirates Blend to release their own side projects and b-sides as well as signing artists. =2005-2006= In the middle of 2005, Bedouin Soundclash appeared on the Vans Warped Tour bill, and had significant chart success in the UK, where Sounding a Mosaic reached No. 1 on the BBC 6 Music charts. They often perform with reggae legend Vernon Buckley from the 1970s reggae duo, The Maytones. On November 4, 2005, the band embarked on a 31-date tour of Canada. In 2006, Bedouin Soundclash held shows with a variety of performers including Ben Harper, Damian Marley, The Skatalites, Burning Spear and The Junction.

The band finished with \\"When The Night Feels My Song\\", which was sung entirely by the crowd (and once the band had left the stage, sung again by the crowd as a \\"thank you\\" to Jay for singing when he was unwell). The band came back on to listen, then Jay invited everyone to come see them again when they come back to Britain in the autumn, saying \\"We owe you one.\\" They were the main performance at the September 17, 2006 Toronto rally calling for Canadian intervention in the Darfur crisis. \\"When the Night Feels My Song\\" becomes the No. 2 most played track on Canadian Radio competing with Nickelback's \\"Photograph\\" and Green Day's \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\".

It was released on August 25, 1992 on the Columbia label of Sony Music. The album peaked at number 25 on The Billboard 200. The album achieved \\"gold\\" status in the United States, but was significantly less successful in a commercial sense than the band's first two albums. It is, nonetheless, regarded by critics as Warrant's strongest record. The tone and style of the album could be said to be the last stage of the glam metal style during the 1980s. It is also the last album to feature all five original members. Production and marketing Warrant began recording bass and drums for Dog Eat Dog in Los Angeles, California in February 1992. Overdubs were recorded at Morrisound Studios in Tampa, Florida, in March 1992. The record was mixed in at Scream Studios in Studio City, California in April 1992 with producer Michael Wagener. Apparently conscious of the widely circulated rumour that Joey Allen and Erik Turner had not played on the first two Warrant records, the band had Wagener include a statement in the liner notes that \\"no artist, except those listed, performed on this album in any capacity whatsoever\\". Jani Lane wrote in the liner notes: \\"This album is dedicated to Joey Allen, one of the most under- rated guitarists in rock today.\\" Shortly after the release of the album, Lane discovered that a large framed poster of Warrant had been removed from the foyer in Columbia Records in Los Angeles and had been replaced by a poster of Seattle band Alice in Chains. It was at this moment, according to Lane, that he realised that \\"the proverbial writing [was] on the wall\\" for the band. In the absence of support from the band's label, radio and MTV, and without a major tour to support the record, sales of the album were sluggish. Songs The album's themes include sex (\\"Machine Gun\\", \\"Bonfire\\"), voyeurism (\\"Hole in My Wall\\"), Orwell style (\\"April 2031\\"), homicidal psychopathy (\\"Andy Warhol Was Right\\"), drug addiction (\\"All My Bridges Are Burning\\"), materialism (\\"Hollywood (So Far, So Good)\\"), and lost relationships (\\"Bitter Pill\\", \\"Let It Rain\\"). The song Machine Gun was the album's first single and featured a music video. The song \\"Bitter Pill\\" which was the second single features an operatic interlude, performed in German by the \\"Moron Fish & Tackle Choir\\". The makeshift \\"Choir\\" consisted of security guards, engineers, janitors, and others who had been available at or near the recording studio.Downboys.com Review The song features two different music videos, one with the album version of the song featuring the whole band in the video and one with the acoustic version of the song featuring only Jani Lane in the video. \\"The Hole in My Wall\\" was released as the third single of the album. \\"Sad Theresa\\" had previously been recorded by Jani Lane and Steven Sweet's old band Plain Jane.

In 'The First Principle of Practical Reason: A Commentary on the Summa Theologiae, I-II, Q. 94, A. 2' (1965) Grisez attacked the neo- scholastic interpretation of Aquinas as holding that moral norms are derived from methodologically antecedent knowledge of human nature. Grisez defended the idea of metaphysical free choice, and proposed a natural law theory of practical reasoning and moral judgement which, although broadly Thomistic, departs from Aquinas on significant points. Through the prism of his reworking of Thomas Aquinas's take on natural law theory, Grisez also was one of the most outspoken and forceful defenders of traditional views on contested matters in sexual morality, such as birth control and abortion. He also wrote influential articles on biotechnology and how such technologies could be used either to support palliative care and the dignity of life or speed up the end of life.

Broadcast by BBC Television from 1952 until 1975, it was the first BBC television series aimed specifically at pre-school children, a development of BBC radio's equivalent Listen with Mother, which had begun two years earlier. In accordance with its intended target audience of pre- school children viewing with their mothers, Watch with Mother was initially broadcast between 3:45 pm and 4:00 pm, post-afternoon nap and before the older children came home from school. The choice of Watch with Mother for the title of the series was intended \\"to deflect fears that television might become a nursemaid to children and encourage 'bad mothering.  Show cycles  Although Andy Pandy had been regularly broadcast every week since mid-1950 (normally on Tuesdays), and was joined by Flower Pot Men in December 1952 (normally on Wednesdays), the name Watch with Mother was not adopted until January 1953, shortly before the programming was expanded to three afternoons a week with the addition of Rag, Tag and Bobtail that September. The \\"classic\\" cycle of shows was in place by September 1955, with the first showing of The Woodentops. Broadcast at 1:30 pm each day, it comprised: * Picture Book – Mondays, from 1955 * Andy Pandy – Tuesdays, from 1950 * Flower Pot Men – Wednesdays, from 1952 * Rag, Tag and Bobtail – Thursdays, from 1953 * The Woodentops – Fridays, from 1955 Each of the five classic shows actually consisted of only a very small number of episodes, all made on film – and all in black-and-white. Typically, not more than 26 programmes were filmed for each show, this being sufficient for a run of six months as there was only one broadcast per week. The aim was to provide children's programming on the cheap: the BBC Children's department had an extremely tiny budget, and needed a collection of films which could be endlessly repeated, typically in six- monthly cycles, for its undemanding pre-school age audience. From April 1963, Watch with Mother was moved to 10.45am (with a further slot at 1.30pm from September 1963). Tales of the Riverbank joined the Watch with Mother slot in December 1963. * Picture Book – Mondays mornings and Wednesday afternoons (from March 1965, only shown on Mondays) * Andy Pandy – Tuesday mornings and Thursday afternoons * Flower Pot Men – Wednesday mornings and Friday afternoons * Rag, Tag and Bobtail – Thursdays mornings and Monday afternoons (from December 1963, only shown on Thursday mornings) * The Woodentops – Friday mornings and Tuesday afternoons The original programmes had a loyal following, and there was concern when it was learned that they would be replaced by new programmes, as in 1965 when it was (wrongly) rumoured that the new show, Camberwick Green, would replace Andy Pandy and Flower Pot Men. Camberwick Green eventually was slotted in the Monday slot in January 1966 and saw an end to Picture Book. Eventually, new programmes were added, including Tales of the Riverbank, Pogles' Wood, The Herbs, Joe, the Trumptonshire trilogy, Barnaby, Mary, Mungo and Midge, Fingerbobs, Bod, and Bizzy Lizzy. In 1975, the Watch with Mother title was dropped, as it was considered to be dated, and the strand was known as See-Saw from 1980 to 1990. A Watch with Mother video became a best-seller in 1987, and was followed by a second and a third in 1989 and a fourth in 1993. A 45rpm promotional single was available to radio disc jockeys, for promo only, entitled \\"Flob-A-Dob-A-Ben\\", in 1987. The single was not released on general release and was played often as a novelty record by Radio Trent on the Andy Marriott Television Show. As the shows were a great success – and fondly remembered by many – modern incarnations of Andy Pandy and Flower Pot Men have been produced. Under British law, copyright in TV programmes lasts for 50 years from the date of first broadcast. As such, surviving episodes first transmitted between 1950 and are slowly appearing on the Internet Archive. In the early 2000s, the shows Andy Pandy and Bill and Ben were remade as stop motion animations, which aired on CBeebies.

The narrator/storyteller for all episodes, who also provided the dialogue for Mummy Woodentop, was Maria Bird who, typical of BBC presenters of the time, spoke with Received Pronunciation. Daddy Woodentop, being a farmer, spoke with a noticeable West Country accent. Although set on a farm, at an unspecified location, each episode began with the whole family being introduced as they sat in front of a tall curtain, apparently on a stage. Episodes closed with the family grouped in the same pose, with the word \\"GOODBYE\\" superimposed above. The music at the beginning and end of each story is taken from the 22nd piece (\\"So lokka me over den myra\\") of the set of 25 Norwegian folk songs and dances for piano, Opus 17 by Edvard Grieg. This music, which is quite short in duration, is called \\"Kulokk\\", which translates to \\"Cattle-Call\\". It is divided into two sections, the first of which is used for the introduction and the second part for the end of each story. It occasionally appears as a leitmotif in the stories, hummed by Mummy Woodentop from time to time. In 1983 the original puppets were stolen from the BBC. They were spotted a year later in an auction room in London and returned. The puppets are now in the Museum of London's permanent collection.String puppet: Mother Woodentop The Official BBC Children in Need Medley In 2009 the Woodentops appeared in The Official BBC Children in Need Medley music videoChildren in Need: Stars help charity to raise £20.3m which reached No.1 in the UK singles chart.

Caslon worked as an engraver of punches, the masters used to stamp the moulds or matrices used to cast metal type. He worked in the tradition of what is now called old-style serif letter design, that produced letters with a relatively organic structure resembling handwriting with a pen. Caslon established a tradition of engraving type in London, which previously had not been common, and was influenced by the imported Dutch Baroque typefaces that were popular in England at the time. His typefaces established a strong reputation for their quality and their attractive appearance, suitable for extended passages of text. The letterforms of Caslon's roman, or upright type include an 'A' with a concave hollow at top left and a 'G' without a downwards-pointing spur at bottom right. The sides of the 'M' are straight. The 'W' has three terminals at the top and the 'b' has a small tapered stroke ending at bottom left. The 'a' has a slight ball terminal. Ascenders and descenders are relatively short and the level of stroke contrast is modest in body text sizes. In italic, Caslon's h folds inwards and the A is sharply slanted. The Q, T v, w, and z all have flourishes or swashes in the original design, something not all revivals follow. The italic J has a crossbar and a rotated casting was used by Caslon in many sizes on his specimens to form the pound sign. However, Caslon created different designs of letter at different sizes: his larger sizes follow the lead of a type he sold cut in the previous century by Joseph Moxon, with more fine detail and sharper contrast in stroke weight, in the \\"Dutch taste\\" style. Caslon's larger-size roman fonts have two serifs on the 'C', while his smaller-size versions have one half-arrow serif only at top right. Caslon's typefaces were popular in his lifetime and beyond, and after a brief period of eclipse in the early nineteenth century returned to popularity, particularly for setting printed body text and books. Many revivals exist, with varying faithfulness to Caslon's original design. Modern Caslon revivals also often add features such as a matching boldface and 'lining' numbers at the height of capital letters, neither of which were used in Caslon's time. William Berkson, designer of a revival of Caslon, describes Caslon in body text as \\"comfortable and inviting\\". History William Caslon in an engraved portrait by John Faber the younger English roman, a Latin text face of the Caslon stable of typefaces. Restored extract from the specimen sheet below. William Caslon's specimen sheet (dated 1734 but actually issued from 1738 onwards). Some of the types shown were not cut by Caslon, most notably the French Canon roman (probably cut by Joseph Moxon). Caslon began his career in London as an apprentice engraver of ornamental designs on firearms and other metalwork. According to printer and historian John Nichols, the main source on Caslon's life, the accuracy of his work came to the attention of prominent London printers, who advanced him money to carve steel punches for printing, first for exotic languages and then as his reputation developed for the Latin alphabet. Punchcutting was a difficult technique and many of the techniques used were kept secret by punchcutters or passed on from father to son. Caslon would later follow this practice himself, according to Nichols teaching his son his methods privately while locked in a room where nobody could watch them. As British printers had little success or experience of making their own types, they were forced to use equipment bought from the Netherlands, or France, and Caslon's types are therefore clearly influenced by the popular Dutch typefaces of his period. James Mosley summarises his early work: \\"Caslon's pica...was based very closely indeed on a pica roman and italic that appears on the specimen sheet of the widow of the Amsterdam printer Dirck Voskens, c.1695, and which Bowyer had used for some years. Caslon's pica replaces it in his printing from 1725…Caslon's Great Primer roman, first used in 1728, a type that was much admired in the twentieth century, is clearly related to the Text Romeyn of Voskens, a type of the early seventeenth century used by several London printers and now attributed to the punch-cutter Nicolas Briot of Gouda.\\" Mosley also describes several other Caslon faces as \\"intelligent adaptations\\" of the Voskens Pica. Caslon's type rapidly built up a reputation for workmanship, being described by Henry Newman in 1733 as \\"the work of that Artist who seems to aspire to outvying all the Workmen in his way in Europe, so that our Printers send no more to Holland for the Elzevir and other Letters which they formerly valued themselves much.\\" Mosley describes Caslon's Long Primer No. 1 type as \\"type with generous proportions and it was normally cast with letter-spacing that was not too tight, characteristics that are needed in types on a small body. And yet it is so soundly made that words that are set in it keep their shape and are comfortably readable...It is a type that works best in the narrow measure of a two-column page or in quite modest octavos.\\" Caslon sold a French Canon face he did not engrave that may to have been the work of Joseph Moxon with some modifications, and his larger- size faces follow this high-contrast model. He publicised his type through contributing a specimen sheet to Chambers' Cyclopedia, which has often been often cut out by antiquarian book dealers and sold separately. Compared to the more delicate, stylised and experimental \\"transitional\\" typefaces gaining ground in mainland Europe during Caslon's life, notably the romain du roi type of the previous century, the work of Pierre-Simon Fournier in Paris, Fleischmann in Amsterdam and the Baskerville type of John Baskerville in Birmingham that appeared towards the end of Caslon's career, Caslon's type was quite conservative. Johnson notes that his 1764 specimen \\"might have been produced a hundred years earlier\\". Stanley Morison described Caslon's type as \\"a happy archaism\\". While not used extensively in Europe, Caslon types were distributed throughout the British Empire, including British North America, where they were used on the printing of the U.S. Declaration of Independence. After William Caslon I’s death, the use of his types diminished, but had a revival between 1840–80 as a part of the British Arts and Crafts movement. Besides regular text fonts, Caslon cut blackletter or 'Gothic' types, which were also printed on his specimen. These could be used for purposes such as title pages, emphasis and drop caps. Bold type did not exist in Caslon's time, although some of his larger-size fonts are quite bold. One criticism of some Caslon-style typefaces has been a concern that the capitals are too thick in design and stand out too much, making for an uneven colour on the page. Printer and typeface designer Frederic Goudy was a critic: \\"the strong contrast between the over-black stems of the capitals and the light weight stems in the lower-case...makes a 'spotty' page\\". He cited dissatisfaction with the style as an incentive for becoming more involved in type design around 1911, when he created Kennerley Old Style as an alternative. The Fry type foundry's imitations of first Baskerville (above) and then Caslon type (below), shown in a specimen attached to an edition of The Printer's Grammar, 1787. Mosley describes them as \\"a very close copy that is not easy to tell from the original.\\" Eclipse Caslon's types fell out of interest in the late eighteenth century, to some extent first due to the arrival of \\"transitional\\"-style typefaces like Baskerville and then more significantly with the growing popularity of \\"Didone\\" or modern designs in Britain, under the influence of the quality of printing achieved by printers such as Bodoni. His type foundry remained in business at Chiswell Street, London, but began to sell alternative and additional designs, some cut by his son William Caslon II. His grandson, William Caslon III, broke away from the family to establish a competitor foundry at Salisbury Square, by buying up the company of the late Joseph Jackson. Justin Howes suggests that there may have been some attempt to update some of Caslon's types towards the newer style starting before 1816, noting that Caslon type cast by the 1840s included \\"a handful of sorts, Q, [an open-form italic] h, ſh, Q, T and Y, which would have been unfamiliar to Caslon, and which may have been cut at the end of the eighteenth century in a modest attempt to bring Old Face up to date. The h, ſh and T are to be seen [in a book from] 1816, large parts of which appear to have been printed from well-worn standing type.\\" Even as Caslon's type itself largely fell out of use, his reputation remained strong within the printing community. The printer and social reformer Thomas Curson Hansard wrote in 1825: > At the commencement of the 18th century the native talent of the founders > was so little prized by the printers of the metropolis, that they were in > the habit of importing founts from Holland, ...and the printers of the > present day might still have been driven to the inconvenience of importation > had not a genius, in the person of William Caslon, arisen to rescue his > country from the disgrace of typographical inferiority. Similarly, Edward Bull in 1842 called Caslon \\"the great chief and father of English type.\\" Return to popularity The History of Henry Esmond, a novel by Thackeray written as a fictional memoir. The first edition of 1852 was printed in Caslon type, then just coming back into fashion. The goal was to achieve a period feel appropriate to its early eighteenth-century setting. Interest in eighteenth-century printing returned in the nineteenth century with the rise of the arts and crafts movement, and Caslon's types returned to popularity in books and fine printing among companies such as the Chiswick Press, as well as display use in situations such as advertising. fine book printing in the nineteenth century in the United Kingdom, for example the famous edition of Byrne's Euclid, published by William Pickering in 1847 and printed by the Chiswick Press. Fine printing presses, notably the Chiswick Press, bought original Caslon type from the Caslon foundry; copies of these matrices were also made by electrotyping. From the 1860s new types began to appear in a style similar to Caslon's, starting from Miller & Richard's Modernised Old Style of c. 1860. (Bookman Old Style is a descendant of this typeface, but made bolder with a boosted x-height very unlike the original Caslon.) The Caslon foundry itself covertly replaced some sizes with new, cleaner versions that could be machine-cast and cut new swash capitals. In the United States, \\"Caslon\\" became almost a genre, with numerous new designs unconnected to the original, with modifications such as shortened descenders to fit American common line, or lining figures, or bold and condensed designs, many foundries creating (or, in many cases, pirating) versions. By the 1920s, American Type Founders offered a large range of styles, some numbered rather than named. The hot metal typesetting companies Linotype, Monotype, Intertype and Ludlow, which sold machines that cast type under the control of a keyboard, brought out their own Caslon releases. Many \\"Caslon\\" fonts are modernised, changing some characters to a modernised form. The Williams Caslon Text digitisation includes stylistic alternate characters allowing the user to choose whether to use Caslon's original characters, which have many flourishes in italic, or simplified \\"modernist\\" letterforms such as a J without crossbar and open-form italic h. According to book designer Hugh Williamson, a second decline in Caslon's popularity in Britain did, however, set in during the twentieth century due to the arrival of revivals of other old-style and transitional designs from Monotype and Linotype. These included Bembo, Garamond, Plantin, Baskerville and Times New Roman. Caslon type again entered a new technology with phototypesetting, mostly in the 1960s and 1970s, and then again with digital typesetting technology. There are many typefaces called \\"Caslon\\" as a result of that and the lack of an enforceable trademark on the name \\"Caslon\\" by itself, which reproduce the original designs in varying degrees of faithfulness. Many of Caslon's original punches and matrices survived in the collection of the Caslon company (along with many replacement and additional characters), and are now part of the St Bride Library and Type Museum collections in Britain. Copies held by the Paris office of the Caslon company, the Fonderie Caslon, were transferred to the collection of the Musée de l'Imprimerie in Nantes. Scholarly research on Caslon's type has been carried out by historians including Alfred F. Johnson, Harry Carter, James Mosley and Justin Howes. Metal type versions =Caslon Old Face= Caslon Old Face in a sample advertisement by the H.W. Caslon company, 1915 Linotype's Caslon Old Face hot metal typesetting adaptation. It was based on types provided by the H.W. Caslon company, although some of these were re-engraved around the end of the nineteenth century rather than being Caslon's original work. The H.W. Caslon & Sons foundry reissued Caslon’s original types as Caslon Old Face from the original (or, at least, early) matrices. The last lineal descendant of Caslon, Henry William Caslon, brought in Thomas White Smith as a new manager shortly before Caslon's death in 1874. Smith took over the company and instructed his sons to change their surnames to Caslon in order to provide an appearance of continuity. The foundry operated an ambitious promotional programme, issuing a periodical, \\"Caslon's Circular\\". It continued to issue specimens from top printers including George W. Jones until the 1920s. Some Caslon faces were augmented by adding new features, in particular swash capitals for historicist printing. From around 1887 the type was sold with additional swash capitals. Howes describes these as \\"based rather closely on François Guyot's [popular 22pt] italic of around 1557...found in English printing until the early years of the eighteenth century.\\" From around 1893 the company started to additionally recut some letters to make the type more regular and create matrices which could be cast by machine. Due to the cachet of the Caslon name, some of the recuttings and modifications of the original Caslon types were apparently not publicly admitted. The H.W. Caslon company also licensed to other printers matrices made by electrotyping, although some companies may also have made unauthorized copies. In 1937, the H.W. Caslon & Sons foundry was also acquired by Stephenson Blake & Co, who thereafter added 'the Caslon Letter Foundry' to their name. The hot metal typesetting companies Monotype and Linotype offered \\"Caslon Old Face\\" releases that were based (or claimed to be based) on Caslon's original typefaces. Linotype's has been digitised and released by Bitstream. =Caslon 471= Caslon 471 on a metal type specimen sheet. Caslon's larger-size fonts had two serifs on the 'C' rather than one. Caslon #471 was the release of the \\"original\\" Caslon type sold by American Type Founders. American Type Founders advertised it as \\"the Caslon Oldstyle Romans and Italics precisely as Mr. Caslon left them in 1766. It was apparently cast from electrotypes held by American Type Founders' precursors. Thomas Maitland Cleland drew a set of additional swash capitals. =Caslon 540= Caslon 540 from a metal type specimen sheet. American Type Founders' additional swash capitals for Caslon 540. Note the difficulty of designing a swash 'I' that does not resemble a 'J'. Caslon 540 was a second American Type Founders version with shortened descenders to allow tighter linespacing. The italic was distributed by Letraset with a matching set of swashes. As a result, this often became sold or used without the regular or roman style of this revival. =Caslon 3= A slighter bolder version of Caslon 540, released by American Type Founders in 1905. BitStream sells Caslon 3 under the name of Caslon Bold with its Caslon 540 release. Russian studio ParaType have released both with Cyrillic glyphs. =Caslon Openface= A decorative openface serif typeface with very high ascenders, popular in the United States. Despite the name, it has no connection to Caslon: it was an import of the French typeface \\"Le Moreau-le-Jeune\\", created by Fonderie Peignot in Paris, by ATF branch Barnhart Brothers & Spindlers. =The Monotype Corporation (UK) = The British Monotype company produced three Caslon revivals. : 1903, Series 20, Old Face Special : 1906, Series 45, Old Face Standard : 1915, Series 128 & 209, Caslon & Caslon Titling. =Imprint= A more regular adaptation of Caslon by the British branch of Monotype was commissioned by the London publishers of The Imprint, a short-lived printing trade periodical that published during 1913. It had a higher x-height and was intended to offer an italic more complementary to the roman. It has remained popular since and has been digitised by Monotype. =Ludlow Typograph Company, Chicago, Illinois, USA= Ludlow had a wide variety of Caslon-types. =Caslon 641= A heavy version of Caslon 540, released by American Type Founders in 1966. =Caslon 223 and 224= Caslon 223 and 224 were phototypesetting families designed by Ed Benguiat of Lubalin, Smith, Carnase and then ITC. Like many ITC families, they have an aggressive, advertising-oriented bold structure, not closely related to Caslon's original work. 223 was the first version (named for LSC's street number), a companion version with more body text-oriented proportions followed sequentially numbered 224. Digital-only releases ligatures of Adobe Caslon Pro. Th is not historic. =Adobe Caslon (1990)= Adobe Caslon is a very popular revival designed by Carol Twombly. It is based on Caslon's own specimen pages printed between 1734 and 1770 and is a member of the Adobe Originals programme. It added many features now standard in high-quality digital fonts, such as small caps, old style figures, swash letters, ligatures, alternate letters, fractions, subscripts and superscripts, and matching ornaments. Adobe Caslon is used for body text in The New Yorker and is one of the two official typefaces of the University of Virginia. A modification is used on U. VA's logo. It is also available with Adobe's Typekit programme, in some weights for free. =Big Caslon (1994)= Two alternative revivals of Caslon, designed for large and small text sizes. Big Caslon by Matthew Carter is inspired by the \\"funkiness\\" of the three largest sizes of type from the Caslon foundry. These have a unique design with dramatic stroke contrast, complementary but very different from Caslon's text faces; one was apparently originally created by Joseph Moxon rather than Caslon. The typeface is intended for use at 18pt and above. The standard weight is bundled with Apple's macOS operating system in a release including small caps and alternates such as the long s. Initially published by his company Carter & Cone, in 2014 Carter revisited the design adding bold and black designs with matching italics, and republished it through Font Bureau. It is used by Boston magazine and the Harvard Crimson. =LTC Caslon (2005)= LTC Caslon is a digitisation of the Lanston Type Company's 14 point size Caslon 337 of 1915 (itself a revival of the original Caslon types). This family include fonts in regular and bold weights, with fractions, ligatures, small caps (regular and regular italic only), swashes (regular italic weight only), and Central European characters. A notable feature is that like some hot metal releases of Caslon, two separate options for descenders are provided for all styles: long descenders (creating a more elegant designs) or short (allowing tighter linespacing). To celebrate its release, LTC included in early sales a CD of music by The William Caslon Experience, a downtempo electronic act, along with a limited edition upright italic design, 'LTC Caslon Remix'. =Williams Caslon Text (2010)= A modern attempt to capture the spirit of Caslon by William Berkson, intended for use in body text. Although not aimed at being fully authentic in every respect, the typeface closely follows Caslon's original specimen sheet in many respects. The weight is heavier than many earlier revivals, to compensate for changes in printing processes, and the italic is less slanted (with variation in stroke angle) than on many other Caslon releases. Berkson described his design choices in an extensive article series. Released by Font Bureau, it includes bold and bold italic designs, and a complete feature set across all weights, including bold small caps and swash italic alternates as well as optional shorter descenders and a 'modernist' italic option to turn off swashes on lower-case letters and reduce the slant on the 'A' for a more spare appearance. It is currently used in Boston magazine and by Foreign Affairs. A notable feature of Caslon's structure is its widely splayed 'T', which can space awkwardly with an 'h' afterwards. Accordingly, an emerging tradition among digital releases is to offer a 'Th' ligature, inspired by the tradition of ligatures in calligraphy, though itself not a historical type ligature, to achieve tighter letterspacing. Adobe Caslon, LTC Caslon, Williams Caslon and Big Caslon (italics only, in the Font Bureau release) all offer a 'Th' ligature as default or as an alternate. Distressed revivals St Luke's church, London Caslon Old Face marketed in a 1915 specimen brochure with mock-18th century title page A number of Caslon revivals are 'distressed' in style, adding intentional irregularities to capture the worn, jagged feel of metal type. =ITC Founder's Caslon (1998)= ITC Founder's Caslon was digitized by Justin Howes. He used the resources of the St Bride Library in London to thoroughly research William Caslon and his types. Unlike previous digital revivals, this family closely follows the tradition of building separate typefaces intended for different sizes. Distressing varies by style, matching the effect of metal type, with large optical sizes offering the cleanest appearance. This family was released by ITC in December 1998. Following the original Caslon types, it does not include bold typefaces, but uses old style figures for all numbers. H. W. Caslon version Following the release of ITC Founder's Caslon, Justin Howes revived the H.W. Caslon & Company name, and released an expanded version of the ITC typefaces under the Founders Caslon name. Caslon Old Face is a typeface with multiple optical sizes, including 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, 22, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 60, 72, 96 points. Each font has small capitals, long esses and swash characters. The 96 point font came in roman only and without small capitals. Caslon Old Face was released in July 2001. Caslon Ornaments is a typeface containing ornament glyphs. These typefaces are packaged in the following formats: *Founders Caslon Text: Caslon Old Face (8, 10, 12, 14, 18), Caslon Ornaments. *Founders Caslon Display: Caslon Old Face (22, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 60, 72), Caslon Ornaments. *Founders Caslon 1776: Caslon Old Face (14), Caslon Ornaments. A selection of the types used on the United States Declaration of Independence. However, following the death of Justin Howes, the revived H.W. Caslon & Company went out of business. =NotCaslon (1995)= An exuberant parody of Caslon italics created by Mark Andresen, this 1995 Emigre font was created by blending together samples of Caslon from \\"bits and pieces of dry transfer lettering: flakes, nicks, and all\\". =Franklin Caslon (2006)= Caslon 540 in a digital version of the Letraset revival, showing some swashes and alternate characters. This 2006 creation by P22 is based on the pages produced by Benjamin Franklin circa 1750. It has a distressed appearance. =Caslon Antique= An American type foundry's family of 'Caslon' types in the metal type period. Most have no connection to William Caslon's own work. This decorative serif typeface was originally called Fifteenth Century, but later renamed Caslon Antique. It is not generally considered to be a member of the Caslon family of typefaces, because its design appears unrelated, and the Caslon name was only applied retroactively.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1920 to 1936, and again from 1941 to 1945. He was the first person of Ukrainian descent to serve as an MLA in Manitoba. Born in Buchachky (now in Sniatyn Raion, Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast), Ukraine, Hryhorczuk came to Canada in 1897 with his family, who settled north of Gilbert Plains, Manitoba. He was educated at Kolomyja Public School. In 1911, he moved to Ethelbert, where he worked as a merchant. Hryhorczuk married Nelly Dzaman in 1905. From 1917 to 1919, he served as reeve of Ethelbert municipality. Hryhorczuk was a member of the Canadian Foresters. Hryhorczuk was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1920 provincial election. Running as an \\"Independent Farmer\\", he was easily elected in the Ethelbert constituency. In the 1922 election, he was nominated as a candidate of the United Farmers of Manitoba (UFM) and was re-elected without opposition in a deferred election. The UFM won the 1922 election, and formed government as the Progressive Party of Manitoba. Hyrhorczuk rallied support for John Bracken to serve as Premier of Manitoba, and later became a backbench supporter of Bracken's government. He was re-elected in the provincial elections of 1927 and 1932. Prior to the 1932 election, the Progressive Party formed an alliance with the Manitoba Liberal Party. This alliance soon took the form of a merger, and government members became known as \\"Liberal-Progressives\\". Hryhorczuk was unexpectedly defeated in the 1936 provincial election by William Lisowsky, a candidate of the Manitoba Social Credit League. Lisowsky did not seek re-election in the 1941 election, however, and Hryhorczuk was narrowly returned over Fred Zaplitny of the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation (CCF). In the 1945 provincial election, CCF candidate Michael Sawchuk defeated Hryhorczuk by 338 votes. This ended Hryhorczuk's career in politics. His son, Michael N. Hryhorczuk, later served in the legislature from 1949 to 1966. The elder Hryhorczuk retired from business in 1978, the same year that his son died, and died the following year at age 90.

Marx first began to work out his idea of surplus product in his 1844 notes on James Mill's Elements of political economy.Karl Marx, Early writings. Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, 1975, p. 274f. or: Marx Engels Collected Works, Vol. 3 (Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1975), p. 225f. Notions of \\"surplus produce\\" have been used in economic thought and commerce for a long time (notably by the Physiocrats), but in Das Kapital, Theories of Surplus Value and the Grundrisse Marx gave the concept a central place in his interpretation of economic history. Nowadays the concept is mainly used in Marxian economics,Ron Stanfield, The economic surplus and neo-Marxism; Howard, M.C. & King, J.E. (2001). \\"Ronald Meek and the rehabilitation of surplus economics\\", in S.G. Medema & W.J. Samuels (eds), Historians of Economics and Economic Thought, London: Routledge, 185-213; Mahesh C.

The frequent translation of the German \\"\\" as \\"surplus\\" makes the term \\"surplus product\\" somewhat inaccurate, because it suggests to English speakers that the product referred to is \\"unused\\", \\"not needed\\", or \\"redundant\\", while most accurately \\"Mehr\\" means \\"more\\" or \\"added\\"—thus, \\"\\" refers really to the additional or \\"excess\\" product produced. In German, the term \\"Mehrwert\\" most literally means value-added, a measure of net output, (though, in Marx's particular usage, it means the surplus-value obtained from the use of capital, i.e. it refers to the net addition to the value of capital owned). Classical economics In Theories of Surplus Value, Marx says in classical economics the \\"surplus\\" referred to an excess of gross income over cost, which implied that the value of goods sold was greater than the value of the costs involved in producing or supplying them. That was how you could \\"make money\\". The surplus represented a net addition to the stock of wealth. A central theoretical question was then to explain the kinds of influences on the size of the surplus, or how the surplus originated, since that had important consequences for the funds available for re-investment, tax levies, the wealth of nations, and (especially) economic growth.Ronald L. Meek, The concept of surplus in the history of economic thought from Mun to Mill. Phd Dissertation, University of Cambridge, 1948, p. 2f.; Heinz D. Kurz, \\"The Surplus Interpretation of the Classical Economists.\\" In: Warren J. Samuels et al., A Companion to the History of Economic Thought. Oxford: Blackwell, 2003, pp. 167-183. This was theoretically a confusing issue, because sometimes it seemed that a surplus arose out of clever trading in already existing assets, while at other times it seemed that the surplus arose because new value was added in production. In other words, a surplus could be formed in different ways, and one could get rich either at the expense of someone else, or by creating more wealth than there was before, or by a mixture of both. This raised the difficult problem of how, then, one could devise a system for grossing and netting incomes & expenditures to estimate only the value of the new additional wealth created by a country. For centuries, there was little agreement about that, because rival economists each had their own theory about the real sources of wealth- creationIsaak Illich Rubin, A History of Economic Thought. London: Ink Links, 1979.—even if they might agree that the value of production must equal the sum of the new revenue which it generates for the producers. Political economy was originally considered to be a \\"moral science\\", which arose out of the moral and juridical ambiguities of trading processes themselves.James E. Alvey, \\"An introduction to economics as a moral science\\". Oakland, Calif.: The Independent Institute, Working Paper #15, December 1999. It was analytically difficult to take the step from the incomes of individuals, the immediate source of which was rather obvious, to a consideration of the incomes of groups, social classes and nations. Frits Bos, \\"Three centuries of macro- economic statistics\\". Eagle Economic & Statistics Working Paper, 2011-02. Somehow, a \\"system of transactors\\" showing aggregate sales and purchases, costs and incomes had to be devised, but just exactly how that system was put together, could differ a great deal, depending on \\"from whose point of view\\" the transactions were considered. The Physiocratic school, for example, believed that all wealth originated from the land, and their social accounting system was designed to show this clearly.Ronald L. Meek, The Economics of Physiocracy: Essays and Translations. London: Allen & Unwin, 1962 and Ronald L. Meek, Quesnay's Tableau Economique, London: Macmillan, 1972 (with Margaret Kuczynski). Marx's definition In Das Kapital and other writings, Marx divides the new \\"social product\\" of the working population (the flow of society's total output of new products in a defined time-interval) into the necessary product and the surplus product. Economically speaking, the \\"necessary\\" product refers to the output of products and services necessary to maintain a population of workers and their dependents at the prevailing standard of life (effectively, their total reproduction cost). The \\"surplus\\" product is whatever is produced in excess of those necessaries. Socially speaking, this division of the social product reflects the respective claims which the labouring class and the ruling class make on the new wealth created. Strictly speaking, however, such an abstract, general distinction is a simplification, for at least three reasons. *A society must usually also hold a fraction of the new social product in reserve at any time. These reserves (sometimes called \\"strategic stocks\\") by definition are not usually available for immediate distribution, but stored in some way, yet they are a necessary condition for longer-term survival. Such reserves must be maintained, even if no other excess to immediate requirements is produced, and therefore they can be considered a permanent reproduction cost, viewed over a longer interval of time, rather than as a true surplus. *An additional complicating factor is population growth, since a growing population means that \\"more product\\" must be produced purely to ensure the survival of that population. In primitive societies, insufficient output just means that people will die, but in complex societies, continually \\"producing more\\" is physically necessary to sustain a growing population (this is admitted by Marx in Capital, Volume III, chapter 48 where he writes: \\"A definite quantity of surplus labour is required as insurance against accidents, and by the necessary and progressive expansion of the process of reproduction in keeping with the development of the needs and the growth of population, which is called accumulation from the viewpoint of the capitalist\\"). *At any time, a fraction of the adult working-age population does not work at all, yet these people must somehow be sustained as well. Insofar as they do not depend directly on the producers of the necessary product for their maintenance, they have to be sustained from communal or state resources, or by some other means. The concept of a social surplus product seems very simple and straightforward at first sight, but for social scientists it is actually a quite complex concept. Many of the complexities are revealed when they try to measure the surplus product of a given economic community.Anwar Shaikh & Ergutul Ahmet Tonak, Measuring the Wealth of Nations: The Political Economy of National Accounts, Cambridge University Press 1994. Use In producing, people must continually maintain their assets, replace assets, and consume things but they also can create more beyond those requirements, assuming sufficient productivity of labour.Martin Orans, \\"Surplus\\", in Human Organization, Vol. 25, 1966, pp. 24-32. This social surplus product can be: *destroyed, or wasted *held in reserve, or hoarded *consumed *traded or otherwise transferred to or from others *reinvestedErnest Mandel, Marxist economic Theory, Vol. 1 (London: Merlin, 1968), chapter 1. Thus, for a simple example, surplus seeds could be left to rot, stored, eaten, traded for other products, or sown on new fields.Charles Woolfson, The Labour theory of Culture: A Re-examination of Engels's Theory of Human Origins. But if, for example, 90 people own 5 sacks of grain, and 10 people own 100 sacks of grain, it would be physically impossible for those 10 people to use all that grain themselves—most likely they would either trade that grain, or employ other people to farm it. Since 5 sacks of grain are insufficient for 90 people, it is likely that the 90 people would be willing to work for the 10 people who own more grain than they can consume, in order to get some extra grain. =Economic growth= If the surplus product is simply held in reserve, wasted or consumed, no economic growth (or enlarged economic reproduction) occurs. Only when the surplus is traded and/or reinvested does it become possible to increase the scale of production. For most of the history of urban civilisation, excess foodstuffs were the main basis of the surplus product, whether appropriated through trade, tribute, taxation, or some other method.Robert J. Wenke, Patterns in Prehistory. =Surplus labour= In Marxism, the existence of a \\"surplus product\\" normally assumes the ability to perform surplus labour, i.e. extra labour beyond that which is necessary to maintain the direct producers and their family dependents at the existing standard of life. In Capital, Vol. 1, chapter 9, section 4, Marx actually defines the capitalist surplus product exclusively in terms of the relationship between the value of necessary labour and surplus labour; at any one time, this surplus product is lodged simultaneously in money, commodities (goods), and claims to labour-services, and therefore is not simply a \\"physical\\" surplus product (a stockpile of additional goods). =Economy of time= In Marx's view, as he expresses it in the Grundrisse all economising reduces to the economy of human labour-time.\\"The less time the society requires to produce wheat, cattle etc., the more time it wins for other production, material or mental. Just as in the case of an individual, the multiplicity of its development, its enjoyment and its activity depends on economization of time. Economy of time, to this all economy ultimately reduces itself. Society likewise has to distribute its time in a purposeful way, in order to achieve a production adequate to its overall needs; just as the individual has to distribute his time correctly in order to achieve knowledge in proper proportions or in order to satisfy the various demands on his activity.\\" — Karl Marx, Grundrisse, Notebook 1, October 1857 The greater human productivity is, the more time there is—potentially—to produce more than is necessary to simply reproduce the population. Alternatively, that extra time can be devoted to leisure, but who gets the leisure and who gets to do the extra work is usually strongly influenced by the prevailing power and moral relations, not just economics. =Human needs= The corollary of increasing wealth in society, with rising productivity, is that human needs and wants expand. Thus, as the surplus product increases, the necessary product per person also increases, which usually means an increase in the standard of living. In this context, Marx distinguishes between the physical minimum requirements for the maintenance of human life, and a moral-historical component of earnings from work. This distinction is however somewhat deceptive, for several reasons. *in more complex societies at least, minimum living costs involve social and infrastructural services, which also incur costs, and which are not optional from the point of view of survival.Len Doyal & Ian Gough, A theory of human need. New York: Guilford Press, 1991. *Which goods can be considered \\"luxuries\\" is not so easy to define. For example, owning a car may be considered a luxury, but if owning a car is indispensable for travelling to work and to shops, it is a necessity. *Michael Hudson points out that in the modern United States, households spent only about a quarter of their income on directly purchasing consumer goods and consumer services. All the rest is spent on payments of interest, rents, taxes, loans, retirement provisions and insurance payments.Michael Hudson, \\"Trade Advantage Replaced by Rent Extraction\\", Renegade Economists Radio, transcript December 17, 2013. Some of these financing payments could be considered \\"moral-historical\\" but some of them are a physical requirement since without them, people could die (for example, because they cannot get health care, or have no shelter). Marxian interpretation of the historical origin For most of human prehistory, Marxian writers like Ernest Mandel and V. Gordon Childe argued, there existed no economic surplus product of any kind at all, except very small or incidental surpluses.Ernest Mandel, Marxist Economic Theory, Vol.1. London: Merlin Press, 1969. Gordon Childe, Man Makes Himself. London: Moonraker Press, 1981. The main reasons were: *that techniques were lacking to store, preserve, and package surpluses securely in large quantities or transport them reliably in large quantities over any significant distance; *the productivity of labour was not sufficient to create much more than could be consumed by a small tribe; *early tribal societies were mostly not oriented to producing more than they could actually use themselves, never mind maximising their production of output. Thus, for example, the anthropologist Marshall Sahlins estimated that the utilization by tribes of the \\"carrying capacity\\" of their habitat ranged from 7% among the Kuikuro of the Amazon basin to about 75% among the Lala of Zambia.Marvin Harris, Cultural materialism: the struggle for a science of culture. New York: Vintage Books, 1979, p. 240. *different groups of people usually did not depend on trade for their survival, and the total amount of trading activity in society stayed proportionally small. The formation of the first permanent surpluses are associated with tribal groups who are more or less settled in one territory, and stored foodstuffs. Once some reserves and surpluses exist, tribes can diversify their production, and members can specialise in producing tools, weapons, containers, and ornaments. Modern archaeological findings show that this development actually began in the more complex hunter-gatherer (foraging) societies.See Gary Feinman and Theron Douglas Price, ed., Archaeology at the Millennium, Springer/Kluwer, 2001, p. 241). The formation of a reliable surplus product makes possible an initial technical or economic division of labour in which producers exchange their products. In addition, a secure surplus product makes possible population growth, i.e. less starvation, infanticide, or abandonment of the elderly or infirm. Finally, it creates the material basis for a social hierarchy, where those at the top of the hierarchy possess prestige goods which commoners do not have access to. =Neolithic revolution= The first real \\"take off\\" in terms of surpluses, economic growth, and population growth probably occurred during what V. Gordon Childe called the neolithic revolution, i.e. the beginning of the widespread use of agriculture, from about 12,000 to 10,000 years ago onward, at which time the world population is estimated to have been somewhere between 1 and 10 million.U.S. Census Bureau, Historical estimates of World Population ). Archaeologist Geoffrey Dimbleby comments: =Staple finance and wealth finance= As regards extraction of a surplus from the working population (whether as a tax, a tribute, a rent or some other method), modern anthropologists and archaeologists distinguish between \\"staple finance\\" and \\"wealth finance\\".Allen W. Johnson & Timothy Earle, The evolution of human societies, 2nd. edition. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2000, pp. 257-258. They do not like the term \\"surplus product\\" anymore, because of its Marxist connotations and definitional controversies, but it boils down to the same thing. *In the case of staple finance, the ordinary households supply staples (often foodstuffs, and sometimes standard items of craftwork) as a payment to the political centre or the property owner. This is a simple \\"payment in kind\\". The ruling elite owns the land, and receives shares of food produced by commoners in exchange for use rights. It is a simple system, though it creates logistical problems of physical storage and transport, as well as the needs to protect stores—from being raided, and from environmental hazards. *In the case of wealth finance, the commoners do not supply staples, but rather valuables (wealth objects or prestige goods) or currencies which are more or less freely convertible in the exchange of goods. Usually currencies are found in state-organized societies; large states invariably use currency systems for taxation and payment. Valuables and currencies are much more portable, easily centralized, and they do not lose value through spoilage. The disadvantage is that they cannot be directly consumed; they have to be exchanged in markets for consumption goods. So, if markets are for some reason disrupted, wealth objects and currencies suddenly lose their value. The system of surplus-extraction might also be a mix of staple finance and wealth finance. The use of the term \\"finance\\" for the appropriation of a surplus is just as troublesome as the term \\"surplus product\\". Commoners required to pay a levy, tax or tribute to the landowners, on pain of imprisonment or death, obviously are not making an \\"investment\\" for which they get a return, but instead are forced to pay the cost of using a piece of land they do not own. The increasing economic division of labour is closely associated with the growth of trade and goes together with an increasing a social division of labour. As Ashley Montagu puts it, \\"barter, trade, and commerce largely depend on a society's exchangeable surpluses.\\"Ashley Montagu, Man: his first million years. New York: New American Library, 1958, p. 110. One group in society utilizes its position in society (e.g. the management of reserves, military leadership, religious authority, etc.) to gain control over the social surplus product; as the people in this elite group assert their social power, everyone else is forced to leave the control over the surplus product to them.Henri J. M. Claessen & Peter Skalník (eds), The Early State. Mouton, 1978; Henri J.M. Claessen and Pieter Van De Velde (eds.), Early State Economics; Henri J.M. Claessen, Pieter Van De Velde (eds), Early State Dynamics; Lawrence Krader, Formation of the state. Although there is considerable controversy and speculation among archaeologists about how exactly these early rulers came to powerTimothy Earle, How the chiefs come to power: the political economy in prehistory. Stanford University Press, 1997. (often because of a lack of written records), there is good evidence to suggest that the process does occur, particularly in tribal communities or clans which grow in size beyond 1,500 or so people.Bruce G. Trigger, \\"Inequality and communication in early civilizations\\", in Trigger, Time and traditions, New York: Columbia University Press, 1978, p. 199. From that point on, the surplus product is formed within a class relationship, in which the exploitation of surplus labour combines with active or passive resistance to that exploitation. =The state= To maintain social order and enforce a basic morality among a growing population, a centralized state apparatus emerges with soldiers and officials, as a distinct group in society which is subsidized from the surplus product, via taxes, tributes, rents and confiscations (including war booty). Because the ruling elite controls the production and distribution of the surplus product, it thereby also controls the state. In turn, this gives rise to a moral or religious ideology which justifies superior and inferior positions in the division of labour, and explains why some people are naturally entitled to appropriate more resources than others. Archaeologist Chris Scarre comments: Archaeologist Bruce G. Trigger comments: Given the rather low labour- productivity of agrarian societies, a proportionally large amount of (surplus-)labour was needed in the ancient world to produce a relatively small amount of physical surplus. Archaeologist Brian M. Fagan comments: According to Gil Stein, the earliest known state organizations emerged in Mesopotamia (3700 BC), Egypt (3300 BC), the Indus Valley (2500 BC) and China (1400 BC).Gil J. Stein, \\"Understanding ancient societies in the old world\\", in Feinman & Price, op. cit., p. 353. In various parts of the world, e.g. Africa and Australasia, tribal societies and chiefdoms persisted for much longer before state formation occurred. Many modern states originated out of colonialism. For example, the British empire at its largest contained a quarter of the world population. Many of the colonized countries originally did not have a state apparatus, only chiefdoms. Socio-economic inequality between people The size of the surplus product, based on a certain level of productivity, has implications for how it can possibly be shared out.John Angle, \\"The Surplus Theory of Social Stratification and the Size Distribution of Personal Wealth\\", in Social Forces, Vol. 65, 1986. 34 pgs. Quite simply, if there is not enough to go around, it cannot be shared equally. If 10 products are produced, and there are 100 people, it is fairly obvious they cannot all consume or use them; most likely, some will get the products, and others must do without. This is according to Marx and Engels the ultimate reason for socioeconomic inequality, and why, for thousands of years, all attempts at an egalitarian society failed. Thus they wrote: But it would be erroneous to simply infer the pattern of socioeconomic inequality from the size of the surplus product. That would be like saying, \\"People are poor because they are poor\\". At each stage of the development of human society, there have always been different possibilities for a more equitable distribution of wealth. Which of those possibilities have been realised is not just a question of technique or productivity, but also of the assertion of power, ideology, and morals within the prevailing system of social relations governing legitimate cooperation and competition. The wealth of some may depend on the poverty of others. Some scarcity is truly physical scarcity; other scarcity is purely socially constructed, i.e. people are excluded from wealth not by physical scarcity but through the way the social system functions (the system of property rights and distributing wealth that it has). In modern times, calculations have been done of the type that an annual levy of 5.2% on the fortunes of the world's 500 or so billionaires would be financially sufficient to guarantee essential needs for the whole world population.Cited in Damien Millet & Eric Toussaint, Who Owes Who? 50 Questions about World Debt. London: Zed Books, 2004, p. 12 In money terms, the world's 1,100 richest people have almost twice the assets of the poorest 2.5 billion people representing 40% of the world population.David Rothkopf, \\"Change is in the air for financial superclass\\", Financial Times, 15 May 2008. In his famous book Capital in the Twenty-First Century, Thomas Piketty suggests that if present trends continue, there will be an even more gigantic concentration of wealth in the future.Thomas Piketty, Capital in the 21st century. Harvard University Press, 2014. In that case, there is no real physical scarcity with regard to the goods satisfying basic human needs anymore. It's more a question of political will and social organisation to improve the lot of the poor, or, alternatively, for the poor to organise themselves to improve their lot. In capitalist society The category of surplus product is a transhistorical economic category, meaning it applies to any society with a stable division of labour, and a significant labour productivity, regardless of how exactly that surplus product is produced, what it consists of, and how it is distributed. That depends on the social relations and relations of production specific to a society, within the framework of which surplus labour is performed. Thus, the exact forms taken by the surplus product are specific to the type of society which creates it. =Historical dynamics= If we plotted economic growth or population growth rates on a graph from, for example, the year zero, we would obtain a tangent curve, with the sharp bend occurring in the 19th century.See e.g. Eric. D. Beinhocker, The Origin of Wealth. New York: Random House, 2007, p. 10. Within the space of 100 years, a gigantic increase in productivity occurred with new forms of technology and labor-cooperation. This was, according to Marx, the \\"revolutionary\\" aspect of the capitalist mode of production, and it meant a very large increase in the surplus product created by human labour. Marx believed it could be the material basis for a transition to communism in the future, a form of human society in which all could live to their potential, because there was enough to satisfy all human needs for everybody. Economic historian Paul Bairoch comments: Economic historian Roberto Sabatino Lopez adds that: =From surplus product to surplus value= Specific to the surplus product within capitalist society, as Marx discusses in Das Kapital, are these main aspects (among others): *The surplus product itself no longer consists simply of \\"physical\\" surpluses or tangible use-values, but increasingly of tradeable commodities or assets convertible into money. Claims to the social product are realised primarily through purchase with money, and the social product itself can be valued in money prices. The economising and division of the necessary and surplus product between different uses, and between different social classes, is increasingly also expressed in quantities of money units. The emphasis is on maximising wealth as such, based on calculations in terms of abstract price relations. *There is an increasingly strong connection between the surplus product and surplus value, so that, as the capitalist mode of production expands and displaces other ways of producing, surplus-value and the surplus-product become to a large extent identical. In a purely capitalist society they would be completely identical (but such a society is unlikely ever to exist, other than in economic models and analogies). *The ability to claim the surplus value created in production through the production of new output, in the form of profit income, becomes very dependent on market sales and buying power. If goods and services fail to sell, because people have no money, the business owner is left with surpluses which are useless to him, and which very likely deteriorate in value. This creates a constant need to maintain and expand market demand, and a growing world market for products and services. *Competition between many different private enterprises exerts a strong compulsion to accumulate (invest) a large part of the surplus product to maintain and improve market position, rather than consume it. Failure to do so would drive business owners out of business. For Marx, this was the main cause behind the gigantic increase in economic growth during the 19th century. *The corollary of the enormous increase in physical productivity (output of goods) is that a larger and larger component of the social product, valued in money prices, consists of the production and consumption of services. This leads to a redefinition of wealth: not just a stock of assets, but also the ability to consume services enhancing the quality of life (note: many activities called \\"services\\" supply tangible products). *The dialectic of scarcity and surplus gradually begins to invert itself: the problem of optimal allocation of scarce resources begins to give away to the problem of the optimal allocation of abundant resources. High productivity leads to excess capacity: more resources can be produced than can be consumed, mainly because buying power is lacking among the masses. This can lead to dumping practices. At the same time, the ownership of wealth becomes strongly concentrated, shutting out huge masses of people from owning any significant assets. *The bourgeoisie as a ruling class is historically rather unusual, because it emerges and exists separately from the state, rather than being the state (like many earlier ruling classes). The different and competing fractions of the bourgeoisie mandate others (usually professional middle-class people, such as lawyers and economists) to govern for them as a \\"political class\\" or polity; the bourgeoisie itself is mainly preoccupied with doing business. Ordinarily, the business class gets rich from business, and not from imposing taxes and tributes themselves (that would often be regarded as a criminal protection racket, not valid trade). The bourgeois state typically lacks ownership of an independent economic base sufficient to self- finance its own activities; it perpetually depends on levying taxes with consent of the population, and on loans from the bourgeoisie. With the bourgeois state, taxpayers have the possibility of electing their own representatives to state office, which means that they can in principle influence the taxation system and the justice system generally. That possibility has rarely existed in non-capitalist states; there, any criticism of the state means that the critic is fined, imprisoned or killed. Marx believed that, by splitting purely economic-commercial considerations off from legal-moral, political or religious considerations, capitalist society for the first time in history made it possible to express the economic functions applying to all types of society in their purest forms.Kozo Uno, Theory of a Purely Capitalist Society. Harvester Press, 1980. In pre-capitalist society, \\"the economy\\" did not exist as a separate abstraction or reality, any more than long-term mass unemployment existed (other than in exceptional cases, such as wars or natural disasters). It is only when the \\"cash nexus\\" mediates most resource allocation, that \\"the economy\\" becomes viewed as a separate domain (the domain of commercial activity), quantifiable by means of money- prices. =Socialist economy= A socialist society, Marxian economists argue, also has a surplus product from an economic point of view, insofar as more is produced than is consumed. Nevertheless, the creation and distribution of the surplus product would begin to operate under different rules. In particular, how the new wealth is allocated would be decided much more according to popular-democratic and egalitarian principles, using a variety of property forms and allocative methods that have proved practically to correspond best to meeting the human needs of all. 20th century experience with economic management shows that there is a broad scala of possibilities here; if some options are chosen, and others not, this has more to do with who holds political power than anything else. Measurement The magnitude of the surplus product can be estimated in stocks of physical use-values, in money prices, or in labour hours. If it is known: *what and how much was produced in a year, *what the population structure is, *what incomes or earnings were received, *how many hours were worked in different occupations, *what the normal actual consumption pattern is, *what the producers pay in terms of taxes or tribute then measures of the necessary product and surplus product can in principle be estimated.See further on this Anwar Shaikh & Ergutul Tonak, Measuring the Wealth of Nations: The Political Economy of National Accounts, Cambridge University Press 1994; Roman Rosdolsky, \\"The Distribution of the Agrarian Product in Feudalism\\", in: Journal of Economic History (1951), pp. 247–265 However it is never possible to obtain mathematically exact or fully objective distinctions between necessary and surplus product, because social needs and investment requirements are always subject to moral debate and political contests between social classes. At best, some statistical indicators can be developed. In Das Kapital, Marx himself was less concerned with measurement issues than with the social relations involved in the production and distribution of the surplus product. Essentially the techniques for estimating the size of the surplus product in a capitalist economy are similar to those for measuring surplus-value. However, some components of the surplus product may not be marketed products or services. The existence of markets always presupposes a lot of non-market labour as well. A physical surplus product is not the same as surplus value, and the magnitudes of surplus product, surplus labour and surplus value may diverge. Social valuation of labour Although it is nowadays possible to measure the number of hours worked in a country with reasonable accuracy, there have been few attempts by social statisticians to estimate the surplus product in terms of labour hours. Very interesting information has become available from time use surveys however on how people in society on average spend their time. From this data, it is evident just how much modern market economies in reality depend on the performance of unpaid (i.e. volunteered) labour. That is, the forms of labour that are the subject of commercial exploitation are quantitatively only a sub-set of the total labour which is done in a society, and depend on non-market labour being performed. This in turn creates a specific and characteristic way in which different labour activities are valued and prioritised. Some forms of labour can command a high price, others have no price at all, or are priceless. Nevertheless, all labor in capitalist society is influenced by value relations, irrespective of whether a price happens to be imputed to it or not. The commercial valuation of labor may not necessarily say anything though about the social or human valuation of labor. Decadence Marxian theory suggests decadence involves a clear waste of a large part of the surplus product from any balanced or nuanced human point of view, and it typically goes together with a growing indifference to the wellbeing and fate of other human beings; to survive, people are forced to shut out from their consciousness those horrors which are seemingly beyond their ability to do anything about anymore. Marx & Engels suggest in The German Ideology that in this case the productive forces are transformed into destructive forces.In The German Ideology (1845), Part 1D titled \\"The necessity of communist revolution\\", Marx and Engels commented that \\"In the development of productive forces there comes a stage when productive forces and means of intercourse are brought into being, which, under the existing relationships, only cause mischief, and are no longer forces of production but forces of destruction (machinery and money)\\".. According to Marxian theory,See further e.g. György Lukács, The Destruction of Reason and Ernest Mandel, Late Capitalism). decaying or decadent societies are defined mainly by the fact that: *The gap between what is produced and what could potentially (or technically) be produced (sometimes called the \\"GDP gap\\" or \\"output gap\\") grows sharply. *A very large proportion of the surplus product is squandered, or devoted to luxury consumption, speculative activity, or military expenditures. *All sorts of activities and products appear which are really useless or even harmful from the point of view of improving human life, to the detriment of activities which are more healthy for human life as a whole. *Enormous wealth and gruesome poverty and squalor exist side by side, suggesting that society has lost its sense of moral and economic priorities. The ruling elite no longer cares for the welfare of the population it rules, and may be divided within itself. *A consensual morality and sense of trust has broken down, criminality increases, and the ruling elite has lost its legitimacy in the eyes of the people, so that it can maintain power only by the crudest of methods (violence, propaganda, and intimidation whereby people are cowed into submission). *A regression occurs to the ideas, values, and practices of an earlier period of human history, which may involve the treatment of other people as less than human. *The society \\"fouls its own nest\\" in the sense of undermining the very conditions of its own reproduction. Marxian scholars such as Ernest Mandel argued this condition typically involves a stalemate in the balance of power between social classes, none of which is really able to assert its dominance, and thus able to implement a constructive programme of action that would ensure real social progress and benefit the whole population. According to Herbert Marcuse, a society is \\"sick\\" if its basic institutions and relationships are such that they make it impossible to use resources for the optimal development of human existence.Herbert Marcuse, Aggression und Anpassung in der Industriegesellschaft. Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1968, p. 11. However, there is a lot of controversy among historians and politicians about the existence and nature of decadence, because value judgements and biases about the meaning of human progress are usually involved. In different periods of history, people have defined decadence in very different ways. For example, hedonism is not necessarily decadent; it is decadent only within a certain context. Thus, accusations of decadence may be made which only reflect a certain moral feeling of social classes, not a true objective reality. Criticisms =Three basic criticisms= *At the simplest level, it is argued that in trade, one man's gain is another man's loss; so if we subtracted total losses from total gains, the result would be zero. So how, then, can there be any surplus, other than goods which fail to be traded? It is not difficult to show that the gains and losses may not balance out, leading to economic crises, but many arguments have been given to show that there are only \\"coincidental\\" or \\"temporary\\" surpluses of some kind. Yet, peculiarly, even on a crude estimate of value added, the gross output value of production equals more than the value of labour and materials costs. If a surplus does not exist, it becomes difficult to explain how economic growth (the growth of output) can occur, and why there was more to distribute than there had been (see surplus-value). Somehow, more comes out of production than went into it. The answer is that much of surplus comes out of human labor, which is a 'renewable resource'; the first form of surplus in many societies, excess food, comes from innovations in agriculture that allow farmers to produce more than they will consume. *The denial that a surplus product exists, therefore tends to focus more on the exact definition of it, i.e. \\"surplus\\" in relation to what exactly?Marvin Harris, \\"The Economy Has No Surplus?\\", in: American Anthropologist Vol. 61, pp. 185-199. For example, is undistributed profit really a \\"surplus\\", or is it a cost of production? Some ecologists also argue that we should produce no more than we really need, in an ecologically responsible way. This raises the question of how we can objectively know whether something is really \\"surplus\\" or not—at best we can say that something is surplus relative to a given set of verifiable human needs, conditions, uses or requirements. In this sense, Siegfried Haas argues for example that surplus is the quantity of natural and produced goods that remains in a society after a year (or other defined time period) when basic biological needs are met and social or religious obligations are fulfilled.Siegfried Haas, Surplus — eine relative Größe in der Gesellschaft. Vienna: Phd Dissertation, 1983. Verlag der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1984. Anthropologist Estellie Smith defines the surplus as \\"the retained resources of production minus consumption\\" or as \\"\\"material and non-material resources in excess of what is culturally defined as the current optimum supply\\".M. Estellie Smith, \\"The ABC's of Political Economy\\", in: Henri J.M. Claessen & Pieter van de Velde, Early State Economics. London: Transaction Publishers, 1991, pp. 64, 41). *Another type of criticism is that the very notion of surplus product is purely relative and circumstantial, or even subjective, because any person can regard something as a 'surplus' if he has command or effective control over it, and is in a position where he can use it in whatever manner he thinks appropriate—even although others would not regard it as \\"surplus\\" at all. In this sense, it might appear as though the concept of \\"surplus product\\" is primarily a moral concept referring to a propensity of human beings \\"to reap where they did not sow\\", whether criminally/immorally, with a legally tolerated justification, or by asserting brute power.*Georges Bataille, The Accursed Share. =Four advanced criticisms= *A different sort of problem is, that the broad division of the annual new social product in net terms, into consumer items and investment items, does not directly map onto the value of costs and revenues generated in producing it. From the social point of view, accounting for what is a \\"cost\\" and what represents an \\"income\\" is always somewhat controversial, since the costs incurred by some correspond to the income receipts of others. The exact procedures adopted for \\"grossing and netting\\" flows of income, expenditures and products always reflect a theory or interpretation of the social character of the economy. Thus, the categories used may not accurately reflect the real relationships involved.Anwar Shaikh & Ergutul Tonak, Measuring the Wealth of Nations: The Political Economy of National Accounts. Cambridge University Press, 1994. *The Cambridge economist Piero Sraffa returned to the classical economic meaning of \\"surplus\\",Piero Sraffa, Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities: Prelude to a Critique of Economic Theory. Cambridge University Press, 1960. but his concept differs from Marx's in at least three important ways: (1) The substance of Sraffa's surplus is not a claim on the surplus labour of others but a physical surplus, i.e. the value of physical output less the value of physical inputs used up to produce it, in abstraction from price changes (roughly, like a \\"standard valuation\\" in national accounts); (2) The magnitude of the surplus in Sraffa's model is exclusively technologically determined by the physical replacement requirements of the economy—and not by power or class relationships—so that the more efficient the economy becomes, the more surplus is created; (3) The form of Sraffa's surplus includes both the gross profit component and the value of goods and services consumed by workers, so that the distribution of the physical surplus between capitalists and workers occurs after a fixed quantity of surplus has already been produced.Frank Roosevelt, \\"Cambridge Economics as Commodity Fetishism\\", in:Review of Radical Political Economics, vol. 7, no. 4, December 1975, pp. 1-32. Reprinted in: Edward J. Nell, Growth, profits, and property: essays in the revival of political economy. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1980, p. 295. In a joint work, Paul Baran and Paul Sweezy follow Sraffa and define the economic surplus as \\"the difference between what a society produces and the costs of producing it\\".Paul Baran and Paul Sweezy, Monopoly Capitalism, New York 1966, p. 9. Marxists have often replied that this view of the matter just stays at the level of double-entry bookkeeping (where the uses of funds balance against the sources of funds), among other things because it makes the surplus simply equal to net value-added in double-entry accounting terms. The \\"accounting point of view\\" itself is never questioned because, in an effort to make concepts \\"scientifically more exact\\", accounting methods are inevitably used. *The existence of a surplus product usually involves power relations among people, who assert what is surplus and what is not, in a perpetual contest over how the social product of their labor ought to be divided up and distributed. In this context, Randall H. McGuire, a Marxist archaeologist, emphasizes that: :Anthropologist Robert L. Carneiro also comments: :Several authors have therefore argued that \\"it is not the surplus which generates stratification, but stratification which generates surplus by activating an unrealized potential for surplus in the productive system\\".Charlotte Seymour- Smith, Macmillan Dictionary of Anthropology. London: Macmillan Press, 1986, p. 272. *It is argued by several anthropologists, archaeologists and historians that we should not automatically assume that the producer of a surplus \\"does not need\\" (has no use for) what he exchanges or hands over as a tribute to a lord, employer or state functionary. Goods may be extracted from the direct producers which are not at all \\"surplus\\" to their own requirements, but which are appropriated by the rulers \\"at the expense\\" of the lifestyle of the direct producers in a \\"zero-sum game\\".Charlotte Seymour-Smith, Macmillan Dictionary of Anthropology. London: Macmillan Press, 1986, p. 272. It all depends on the intensity of exploitation. So, for example, a law might stipulate that peasants must pay a fixed quantity of their products as a tax, regardless of whether the harvest has been good or bad. If the harvest was bad, the peasants might be left with insufficient products for their own needs. =Karl Marx versus Adam Smith= Adam Smith found the origin of the division of labour in the \\"natural\\" human propensity to truck, barter and exchange. He stated that \\"the certainty of being able to exchange all that surplus part of the produce of his own labour, which is over and above his own consumption, for such parts of the produce of other men's labour as he may have occasion for, encourages every man to apply himself to a particular occupation, and to cultivate and bring to perfection whatever talent or genius he may possess for that particular species of business\\".Adam Smith, The wealth of nations, Book 1 Chapter 2. In Marx's view, commercial trade powerfully stimulated the growth of a surplus product, not because the surplus product is itself generated by trade, or because trade itself creates wealth (wealth has to be produced before it can be distributed or transferred through trade), but rather because the final purpose of such trade is capital accumulation, i.e. because the aim of commercial trade is to grow richer out of it, to accumulate wealth. If traders did not get an income out of trading (because their sales revenue exceeds their costs) they would not engage in it. Income growth can, ultimately, only occur if the total stock of assets available for distribution itself grows, as a result of more being produced than existed before. The more surplus there is, the more there is that can be appropriated and traded in order to make money out of it. If people just consume what they produce themselves, other people cannot get rich from that. Thus, because the accumulation of capital normally stimulates the growth of the productive forces, this has the effect that the size of the surplus product which can be traded will normally grow also. The more the trading network then expands, the more complex and specialized the division of labour will become, and the more products people will produce which are surplus to their own requirements. Gradually, the old system of subsistence production is completely destroyed and replaced with commercial production, which means that people must then necessarily trade in order to meet their needs (\\"market civilization\\"). Their labour becomes social labour, i.e. co-operative labour which produces products for others—products which they don't consume themselves. It is, of course, also possible to amass wealth simply by taking it off other people in some way, but once this appropriation has occurred, the source of additional wealth vanishes, and the original owners are no longer so motivated to produce surpluses, simply because they know their products will be taken off them (they no longer reap the rewards of their own production, in which case the only way to extract more wealth from them is by forcing them to produce more). It's like killing the goose that lays the golden egg. In The Wealth of Nations Adam Smith had already recognized the central importance of the division of labour for economic growth, on the ground that it increased productivity (\\"industriousness\\" or \\"efficiency\\"), but, Marx suggests,In chapter 14 of Capital, Volume I. Smith failed to theorize clearly why the division of labour stimulated economic growth. *From the fact that an efficient division of labour existed between producers, no particular method of distributing different products among producers necessarily followed. In principle, given a division of labour, products could be distributed in all kinds of ways—market trade being only one way—and how it was done just depended on how claims to property happened to be organised and enforced using the available technologies. Economic growth wasn't a logically necessary effect of the division of labour, because it all depended on what was done with the new wealth being shared out by the producers, and how it was shared out. All kinds of distributive norms could be applied, with different effects on wealth creation. *Smith confused the technical division of work tasks between co- operatively organized producers, to make production more efficient, with the system of property rights defining the social division of labour between different social classes, where one class could claim the surplus product from the surplus labour of another class because it owned or controlled the means of production.See further Ali Rattansi, Marx and the division of labour. Humanities Press, 1982. In other words, the essential point was that the social division of labour powerfully promoted the production of surpluses which could be alienated from the producers and appropriated, and those who had control over this division of labour in fact promoted specific ways of organizing production and trade precisely for this purpose—and not necessarily at all to make production \\"more efficient\\".Michael Perelman \\"The Curious Case of Adam Smith's Pin Factory\\". Paper presented at the 41st Annual Meetings of the History of Economics Society. University of Quebec, Montreal June 20–22, 2014.. Andre Gorz (ed.). The division of labour. Harvester, 1976. This reader contains the important article by Stephen Marglin, \\"What do bosses do?\\" * Smith's theoretical omissions paved the way for the illusion that market trade itself generates economic growth, the effect of that being that the real relationship between the production and distribution of wealth became a mystery. According to Marx, this effect in economic theory was not accidental; it served an ideological justifying purpose, namely to reinforce the idea that only market expansion can be beneficial for economic growth. In fact, the argument becomes rather tautological, i.e. market expansion is thought to be \\"what you mean\\" by economic growth. The logical corollary of such an idea was, that all production should ideally be organized as market-oriented production, so that all are motivated to produce more for the purpose of gaining wealth. The real aim behind the justification however was the private accumulation of capital by the owners of property, which depended on the social production of a surplus product by others who lacked sufficient assets to live on. In other words, the justification reflected that market expansion was normally the main legally sanctioned means in capitalist society by which more wealth produced by others could be appropriated by the owners of capital, and that for this purpose any other form of producing and distributing products should be rejected. Economic development then became a question of how private property rights could be established everywhere, so that markets could expand (see also primitive accumulation). This view of the matter, according to Marx, explained precisely why the concept of the social surplus product had vanished from official economic theory in the mid-19th century—after all, this concept raised the difficult political and juridical question of what entitles some to appropriate the labour and products of others. Markets were henceforth justified with the simple idea that even if some might gain more than others from market trade, all stood to gain from it; and if they didn't gain something, they would not trade. Marx's reply to that was essentially that most people were in a position where they necessarily had to trade, because if they didn't, they would perish—without having much control over the terms of trade. In that respect, the owners of capital were in a vastly stronger position than workers who owned only some personal belongings (and perhaps some small savings).

The Kutama are attested much earlier, in the form Koidamousii by the Greek geographer Ptolemy.Registre des Provinces et Cités d’Afrique, éd. et trad. S. Lancel, in Victor de Vita, Belles Lettres, Paris, 2002, p. 270, Sitif., n° 29. Ptolémée, Géographie, IV, 2, 5, éd. C. Müller. The Kutama played a pivotal role during the Fatimid Caliphate (909–1171), forming the Fatimid army which eventually overthrew the Aghlabids who controlled Ifriqiya, and which then went on to conquer Egypt and the southern Levant in 969–975. The Kutama remained one of the mainstays of the Fatimid army until well into the 11th century. Their role in the dynasty was so great that Ibn Khaldun counted the dynasty among the Berber dynasties.  Ancient history  The Kutama are attested in the form Koidamousii, by the Greek geographer Ptolemy, whose African documentation seems to date from the years 100-110. They were then in the region of the Ampsaga river (oued el-Kebir) in Mauretania Caesariensis. He locates them upstream of the Khitouae tribe and downstream of the Todoukae tribe, themselves located near the sources of the river. In the second century, they formed part of the Bavares tribal confederation, which gave a hard time to the Roman power, both in Mauretania Caesarean, then Sitifian after 303, and in Numidia. This political and military opposition did not prevent a certain romanization, at least punctually, thus the creation of the milestone respublica Vahartanensium, probably linked to the need for a road crossing of the massif which is hardly attested until the reign of Hadrian. In 411, their chief town Ceramusa or Ceramudensis plebsis is attested as the seat of a bishopric. The same episcopal seat was occupied by a certain Montanus of Cedamusa during the vandal era. In the 6th century, during the byzantine rule, the kutama are attested by a Christian inscription, where a king of the Ucutumani—the Berber prefix u- is indicating parentage—is said in Latin Dei servus (slave of God). This inscription was discovered at the Fdoulès pass, south of Igilgili, at one of the last passes before the descent to Milevum.  Post-classical history  = Early islamic history = The oldest accounts of the muslim conquest of the Maghreb, Ibn Abd al-Hakam and Khalifah ibn Khayyat, do not speak of them, any more than al-Ya'qubi (d. 897) and Ibn al-Faqih (d. after 903). Their name appears for the first time among that of other Berber tribes in the al-Masālik of Ibn Khordadbeh (d. 885). The tribe was not very important at that time. The Kutama probably had embraced Islam, first in its Kharidjite version, a little before the middle of the 8th century. The fact remains that in 757-758 AD, during the capture of Kairouan by the Ibadites, Kutama were among the Kharidjite troops, allied with Abu al-Khattab al- Ma'afiri and Abd al-Rahman ibn Rustam. The latter, then governor of Kairouan, appointed one of their own, Uqayba, to head it. = Aghlabid era = Little is known about the Kutama for the rest of the eighth century, after the advent of the Aghlabids at Kairouan in 789. The Kutama contented themselves with ignoring the Aghlabid authorities and welcoming the rebel soldiers in their inaccessible mountains. Their large population and the isolation in their mountains caused them not to suffer any oppression on the part of this dynasty. = Fatimid era = Conversion to Isma'ilism At the end of the 9th century, in 893/4, some Kutama notables met in Mecca the Isma'ili da'i Abu Abdallah al-Shi'i who attracted them to Isma'ili Shi'ism, and accompanied them on their return. In Ikjan, their chief town, the da'i managed to win the sympathy of the population. It was probably around this time that their geographic and human extension began. The territory that the Kutama occupied from this time seems much more extensive than it was in Roman times; it then encompassed the northern mountain ranges that stretch from Bougie to around Constantine, which al-Bakri calls Jabal Kutama, \\"the mountains of the Kutama\\". This area, limited to the west by the country of Zouaoua (Kabylie of Djurdjura, Soummam valley and Bejaia region), extended south to Sétif, Mila, Constantine, Collo and Jijel. It was made up of Lesser Kabylia, the Collo Massif, part of the chain of Bibans, the mountains of Ferjioua, the numidic chain. This region has an extremely rugged terrain, with a steep coast, bordered by wooded mountains of very difficult access, the gaps being extremely rare, with mountains reaching almost 2000 m. The villages are perched on peaks and ridges that are difficult to access. The region presents itself as an almost impenetrable natural fortress. Later the Kutama were established further south in the plains. This extension suggests that, taking advantage of the weaknesses of the central government, the Kutama had reconstituted under their own name the old Bavares confederation, had extended to the south by reclaiming the fringe of the high plains bordering the southern flank of their mountains (Mila, Sétif regions, etc), an area favorable to the cultivation of cereals, of which their ancestors had been deprived in Roman times, for the benefit of Romano-Berber cities. Conquest of the Aghlabid emirate Map of the fall of the Aghlabid Emirate to the Kutama led by Abu Abdallah Abu Abdallah formed a powerful army and launched his troops against the Aghlabid fortresses in Lesser Kabylia. A first attack failed: after occupying Mila in 902, the da'i was defeated by the son of the emir Ibrahim II, who however did not succeed in pursuing him until Ikjan. The Kutama were able to adapt and constitute a formidable militia. Under the orders of Abu Abdallah, they took Sétif in 904, Belezma in 905, then Béja, against superior armies in both number and armament. In 907/8 they attacked the core of Ifriqiya. After the capitulation of Meskiana and Tébessa, they captured Constantine. Abu Abdallah defeated the army of Ziyadat Allah III at al-Urbus (ancient Laribus); the Aghlabids, defeated on all sides, abandoned by their followers, fled to the East. The victors entered Kairouan, parading in Raqqada in March 909. The da'i proclaimed an amnesty, but distributed the spoils among his forces. Assured of the victory, he revealed the name of his master, Abdallah al-Mahdi Billah, and went to Sijilmasa, where he was held, to escort him to Kairouan. On the way, the Kutama army conquered the Rustamid imamate and drove the Ibadis from Tiaret, who went to take refuge in Sadrata, the capital of Ouargla oasis. Rise to prominence under the early Fatimids The Kutama were the mainstay and elite of the early Fatimid armies. Although other Berber tribes soon flocked to the Fatimid banner—notably the large Sanhaja confederation during the reign of al-Mansur bi-Nasr Allah—the Kutama continued to provide the bulk of the Fatimid armies until after the Fatimid conquest of Egypt in 969. According to the historian Heinz Halm, the early Fatimid state can be likened to a \\"hegemony of the Kutama\\", particularly of the four sub-tribes of Jimala, Lahisa, Malusa, and Ijjana. In 948, Caliph al-Mansur publicly remarked that God had granted them pre-eminence among all other peoples, since they had first seen and accepted the truth. On the other hand, this dominion of the semi-civilized Kutama was greatly resented, not only by the other Berber tribes, but chiefly by the Arab and Arabicized inhabitants of the cities. As Halm writes, the situation was similar to a scenario where, \\"in the early eighteenth-century North America, the Iroquois, converted to Catholicism by Jesuit missionaries, had overrun the Puritan provinces of New England, installed their chieftains as governors in Boston, Providence and Hartford, and proclaimed a European with dubious credentials as King of England\\". Inevitably, the arrogance and exactions of the Kutama led to rebellions in the newly conquered Fatimid domains, in which the Kutama particularly were singled out and killed by the rebels. Decline After the move of the seat of the caliphate to Egypt in 973, a large number of Kutama accompanied the dynasty east. However, the forays into the Levant in the 970s revealed the inadequacies of an army based solely on the Kutama, and from 978, the Fatimids began incorporating ethnic groups, notably the Turks and Daylamites, from the eastern Islamic lands into their army. In combination with the increasing difficulty of renewing their pool of Kutama recruits after , these events challenged the position of the Kutama in the army. Thereafter, a fierce rivalry developed between the Kutama and the \\"Easterners\\" (Mashāriqa). In 996, on the accession of al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, the Kutama refused to acknowledge the new caliph unless the Kutama leader al- Hasan ibn Ammar was appointed as vizier. This was done, but Ibn Ammar's blatantly pro-Berber regime quickly alienated other members of the elite, and he was overthrown a year later. Finally, when al-Hakim assumed the reins of government in 1000, he launched a purge of the Fatimid elites, during which Ibn Ammar and many of the other prominent Kutama were executed. Thereafter the position of the Kutama steadily declined, so that in November 1025, during an official review, the once numerous and proud Kutama were reduced to demanding bread to sate their hunger. Shortly after, they were unable to mobilize even 100 horsemen at short notice. On the other hand, the Persian traveller Nasir Khusraw mentions that there were 20,000 Kutama horsemen during his visit to Egypt in 1047. During the chaos of the years 1062–1073, the Kutama allied themselves with the Sudān against the Turks and the Daylamites. The last remnants of the Kutama were dismissed from the Fatimid army after Badr al- Jamali came to power in 1073.

It means labour performed in excess of the labour necessary to produce the means of livelihood of the worker (\\"necessary labour\\"). The \\"surplus\\" in this context means the additional labour a worker has to do in his/her job, beyond earning his own keep. According to Marxian economics, surplus labour is usually uncompensated (unpaid) labour. Origin Marx explains the origin of surplus labour in the following terms: The historical emergence of surplus labour is, according to Marx, also closely associated with the growth of trade (the economic exchange of goods and services) and with the emergence of a society divided into social classes. As soon as a permanent surplus product can be produced, the moral-political question arises as to how it should be distributed, and for whose benefit surplus-labour should be performed. The strong defeat the weak, and it becomes possible for a social elite to gain control over the surplus-labour and surplus product of the working population; they can live off the labour of others. Labour which is sufficiently productive so that it can perform surplus labour is, in a cash economy, the material foundation for the appropriation of surplus-value from that labour. How exactly this appropriation will occur, is determined by the prevailing relations of production and the balance of power between social classes. According to Marx, capital had its origin in the commercial activity of buying in order to sell and rents of various types, with the aim of gaining an income (a surplus value) from this trade. But, initially, this does not involve any capitalist mode of production; rather, the merchant traders and rentiers are intermediaries between non-capitalist producers. During a lengthy historical process, the old ways of extracting surplus labour are gradually replaced by commercial forms of exploitation. Historical materialism In Das Kapital Vol. 3, Marx highlights the central role played by surplus labour: This statement is a foundation of Marx's historical materialism insofar as it specifies what the class conflicts in civil society are ultimately about: an economy of time, which compels some to do work of which part or all of the benefits go to someone else, while others can have leisure-time which in reality depends on the work efforts of those forced to work. In modern society, having work or leisure may often seem a choice, but for most of humanity, work is an absolute necessity, and consequently most people are concerned with the real benefits they get from that work. They may accept a certain rate of exploitation of their labour as an inescapable condition for their existence, if they depend on a wage or salary, but beyond that, they will increasingly resist it. Consequently, a morality or legal norm develops in civil society which imposes limits for surplus-labour, in one form or another. Forced labour, slavery, gross mistreatment of workers etc. are no longer generally acceptable, although they continue to occur; working conditions and pay levels can usually be contested in courts of law. Unequal exchange Marx acknowledged that surplus labour may not just be appropriated directly in production by the owners of the enterprise, but also in trade. This phenomenon is nowadays called unequal exchange. Thus, he commented that: In this case, more work effectively exchanges for less work, and a greater value exchanges for a lesser value, because some possess a stronger market position, and others a weaker one. For the most part, Marx assumed equal exchange in Das Kapital, i.e. that supply and demand would balance; his argument was that even if, ideally speaking, no unequal exchange occurred in trade, and market equality existed, exploitation could nevertheless occur within capitalist relations of production, since the value of the product produced by labour power exceeded the value of labour power itself. Marx never completed his analysis of the world market however. In the real world, Marxian economists like Samir Amin argue, unequal exchange occurs all the time, implying transfers of value from one place to another, through the trading process. Thus, the more trade becomes \\"globalised\\", the greater the intermediation between producers and consumers; consequently, the intermediaries appropriate a growing fraction of the final value of the products, while the direct producers obtain only a small fraction of that final value. The most important unequal exchange in the world economy nowadays concerns the exchange between agricultural goods and industrial goods, i.e. the terms of trade favour industrial goods against agricultural goods. Often, as Raul Prebisch already noted, this has meant that more and more agricultural output must be produced and sold, to buy a given amount of industrial goods. This issue has become the subject of heated controversy at recent WTO meetings. The practice of unequal or unfair exchange does not presuppose the capitalist mode of production, nor even the existence of money. It only presupposes that goods and services of unequal value are traded, something which has been possible throughout the whole history of human trading practices. Criticism of Marx's concept of surplus labour According to economist Fred Moseley, \\"neoclassical economic theory was developed, in part, to attack the very notion of surplus labour or surplus value and to argue that workers receive all of the value embodied in their creative efforts.\\" Some basic modern criticisms of Marx's theory can be found in the works by Pearson, Dalton, Boss, Hodgson and Harris (see references). The analytical Marxist John Roemer challenges what he calls the \\"fundamental Marxian theorem\\" (after Michio Morishima) that the existence of surplus labour is the necessary and sufficient condition for profits. He proves that this theorem is logically false. However, Marx himself never argued that surplus labour was a sufficient condition for profits, only an ultimate necessary condition (Morishima aimed to prove that, starting from the existence of profit expressed in price terms, we can deduce the existence of surplus value as a logical consequence). Five reasons were that: *profit in a capitalist operation was \\"ultimately\\" just a financial claim to products and labour services made by those who did not themselves produce those products and services, in virtue of their ownership of private property (capital assets). *profits could be made purely in trading processes, which themselves could be far removed in space and time from the co-operative labour which those profits ultimately presupposed. *surplus labour could be performed, without this leading to any profits at all, because e.g. the products of that labour failed to be sold. *profits could be made without any labour being involved, such as when a piece of unimproved land is sold for a profit. *profits could be made by a self-employed operator who did not perform surplus labour for somebody else, nor necessarily appropriated surplus labour from anywhere else. All that Marx really argued was that surplus labour was a necessary feature of the capitalist mode of production as a general social condition. If that surplus labour did not exist, other people could not appropriate that surplus labour or its products simply through their ownership of property. Also, the amount of unpaid, voluntary and housework labour performed outside the world of business and industry, as revealed by time use surveys, suggests to some feminists (e.g. Marilyn Waring and Maria Mies) that Marxists may have overrated the importance of industrial surplus labour performed by salaried employees, because the very ability to perform that surplus-labour, i.e. the continual reproduction of labour power depends on all kinds of supports involving unremunerated work (for a theoretical discussion, see the reader by Bonnie Fox). In other words, work performed in households--often by those who do not sell their labour power to capitalist enterprises at all--contributes to the sustenance of capitalist workers who may perform little household labour. Possibly the controversy about the concept is distorted by the enormous differences with regard to the world of work: *in Europe, the United States, Japan and Australasia, *the newly industrialising countries, and *the poor countries. Countries differ greatly with respect to the way they organise and share out work, labour participation rates, and paid hours worked per year, as can be easily verified from ILO data (see also Rubery & Grimshaw's text). The general trend in the world division of labour is for hi-tech, financial and marketing services to be located in the richer countries, which hold most intellectual property rights and actual physical production to be located in low-wage countries. Effectively, Marxian economists argue, this means that the labour of workers in wealthy countries is valued higher than the labour of workers in poorer countries. However, they predict that in the long run of history, the operation of the law of value will tend to equalize the conditions of production and sales in different parts of the world.

He is the current head coach of the New York Institute of Technology college baseball team. The Long Island native batted left-handed and threw right-handed. In his career, Catalanotto played all infield and outfield positions except shortstop and center field. Professional career =Detroit Tigers (1997–1999)= Catalanotto began his professional baseball career in 1992 when the Detroit Tigers—who first noticed him while scouting higher-profile players at a Smithtown East baseball game in 1991—drafted him in the tenth round of the 1992 Major League Baseball draft. Primarily a second baseman in the minors, he made his major league debut at second base on September 3, 1997. While in Detroit, Catalanotto battled injuries and a lack of playing time, and never recorded a season of 300 at bats for the Tigers. Detroit general manager Randy Smith chose not to protect Catalanotto in the 1996 Rule 5 draft, and he was selected by the Oakland Athletics, spending spring training with them. Catalanotto did not make the Athletics squad and was returned to the Tigers for the 1997 season. As a reserve, Catalanotto logged significant time not only at second base, but at first base and third base as well. Over his three- year span in Detroit, he was the most often used pinch hitter for the Tigers, leading the American League (AL) in pinch-hit at bats in the 1998 season. =Texas Rangers (2000–2002)= On November 2, 1999, Catalanotto was part of an eight player trade between the Tigers and the Texas Rangers. In the deal, he was dealt to Texas along with pitchers Francisco Cordero and Justin Thompson, catcher Bill Hasselman, and a minor leaguer for slugging outfield star Juan González, catcher Gregg Zaun, and pitcher Danny Patterson. Catalanotto made a splash to start to his Rangers career, collecting ten hits and three walks in thirteen consecutive plate appearances from April 21 to May 18, 2000. This streak stands as the Rangers franchise record for consecutive appearances reaching base. He also tied the club's record for hits in a single game (five) on May 17. After another season plagued by injuries in 2000, Catalanotto finally burst onto the scene in 2001 when he finished fifth in the AL in batting average (.330), and recorded a .431 batting average in August. He also logged a number of innings in the outfield, a position he had fielded for only one inning before 2001. Catalanotto battled injuries again in 2002, and the Rangers declined to offer him a contract in the 2003 offseason. =Toronto Blue Jays (2003–2006)= On May 1, 2004, against the Chicago White Sox, he set the Blue Jays record for hits in a game, going 6 for 6 in the second game of a double-header. Catalanotto was named AL player of the week after hitting .500 in the last week of the 2005 season helping him finish with an average of .301. He also won the AL player of the week on July 25, 2005. On June 5, 2005, at Oakland, he collected the 700th hit of his major league career and on September 22 he scored the 400th run of his career against Seattle. =Texas Rangers (2007–2008)= On November 19, 2006, the Texas Rangers announced that they had reacquired Catalanotto, signing him to a three-year contract worth $13.5 million. Catalanotto was released by the Rangers on April 1, 2009. =Milwaukee Brewers (2009)= On May 12, the Milwaukee Brewers signed Catalanotto to a minor league contract. On May 25, his contract was purchased from the Double-A Huntsville Stars. Catalanotto wore the number 20 for the first few games in 2009, until switching to the released Brad Nelson's number 27 on June 1. =New York Mets (2010)= On January 30, 2010, Catalanotto signed a minor league contract with the New York Mets with an invitation to spring training.http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2010/01/mets-sign-frank- catalanatto.html On May 10, 2010, the Mets announced that Catalanotto had been designated for assignment, a move that he felt might signal \\"the end of [his MLB] career\\". Chris Carter was brought up from the Buffalo Bisons to fill Catalanotto's roster spot. Catalanotto retired on March 6, 2011.Ex-Tiger Frank Catalanotto retires after 14 seasons Coaching career Catalanotto was hired on June 7, 2018 as the head coach of the New York Institute of Technology college baseball team. In his first season in 2019, he led his team to a 32-14 record and a berth in the East Coast Conference tournament. Head coaching record Personal life Catalanotto is an honorary chairman for the Vascular Birthmarks Foundation and participates in Little League Baseball programs. He is the president of the Frank Catalanotto Foundation. He and his wife, Barbara, have four children: Morgan, Camdyn, Karson and Gracyn. Morgan was born with a vascular birthmark that spread across her face when she was just two weeks old. This is the reason the Catalanotto's have become honorary chairs for the Vascular Birthmarks Foundation and started the Frank Catalanotto Foundation. Despite not having Italian citizenship, Catalanotto's Italian heritage made him eligible to play for the Italian national team at the 2006 and 2009 World Baseball Classic. Catalanotto was inducted into the Suffolk Sports Hall of Fame on Long Island, New York, in the Baseball Category with the Class of 2010.

He was also Minister for External Trade and Minister for Sugar.  Diplomatic career  A native of the small island of Dravuni in the Kadavu archipelago, Tavola was educated at Ratu Sukuna Memorial School and began his career in 1973 as an agricultural economist with the Ministry of Agriculture. In 1984 he was posted to London as a Counsellor with the Fijian High Commission; he concurrently represented the Fiji Sugar Marketing Company. He was transferred to Brussels and appointed Ambassador to Belgium in 1988, and was accredited to France, Portugal, Spain, Luxembourg, and Greece, as well as to UNESCO and the World Trade Organization. He remained in that position for ten years.  Political career  Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase appointed Tavola Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Interim Government that took office in July 2000, following a counter-coup which thwarted George Speight's putsch against the elected government of Mahendra Chaudhry. In the general election held to restore democracy in September 2001, Tavola was elected as a candidate of the Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua to represent the Lami Open Constituency, and retained his Cabinet position subsequently. As Foreign Minister, Tavola had to defend Fiji's international image in the face of criticism from some countries of the government's perceived lenience towards perpetrators of the 2000 coup. He also had to deal with elements in his own government who have promoted relations with Taiwan (ROC), in defiance of his policy of fostering closer relations with the People's Republic of China. A private visit by the Taiwanese President, Chen Shui-bian, on 5 May 2005 was well received by many politicians, and on 16 May Health Minister Solomone Naivalu defied Tavola's instructions by voting in favour of observer status for Taiwan at the World Health Assembly in Geneva. Tavola was angered, declaring that Fiji could not afford to \\"lose\\" China, and vowed that such \\"careless incidences\\" would not happen again.  Retirement and reappointment  In an interview published on 2 February 2006 by Islands Business International, Tavola announced his decision not to contest forthcoming elections, due on 6–13 May, citing his age, health, and family commitments. \\"Because of my other commitments in life and for family and health reasons ... I would be doing a disservice to myself and to the country if I stood in the coming general election,\\" he said. Prime Minister Qarase had attempted, unsuccessfully, to dissuade him from this decision, he revealed. He clarified on 23 February that he only wanted to rest, and was not interested in returning to the diplomatic service. Following the victory of the ruling SDL in the general election, Prime Minister Qarase persuaded Tavola to reverse his decision to retire from the Cabinet. As Cabinet Ministers are required to be members of one of the two Houses of the Parliament, he accepted the Prime Minister's invitation to become a Senator as one of nine nominees of the Prime Minister. \\"I had my retirement worked out. I was going to start some consultancy work and all that,\\" he said in a Fiji Live interview published on 11 June 2006. \\"It was a last-minute approach to me by the Prime Minister to consider coming back into this important portfolio.\\" The Fiji Live news service claimed on 4 February that Tavola was Fiji's most popular politician. Following the 2000 coup crisis, Tavola was reportedly the only Ministerial candidate acceptable to both the Military and the rebels led by George Speight. Fiji Live also claims that he remained the only Cabinet Minister to retain the favour of the Military after relations between the government and the Military worsened from 2003 onwards. However, he still lost his post in the Cabinet, along with his fellow Ministers, in the military coup that deposed the government on 5 December 2006.

From there, trains continue on to the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk on the SPP Watsonville–Davenport line. The SCBT&P; is one of very few railroads in North America with extensive street running rails. History Santa Cruz Portland Cement 0-4-0 #2 steam engine rolling into Santa Cruz, California on former SP trackage on Chestnut Street The railway began life as the narrow gauge Santa Cruz and Felton Railroad, built between its namesake cities of Santa Cruz and Felton in 1875 to send logs and lumber down from the Santa Cruz Mountains to mills and wharves on Monterey Bay. In 1876, the South Pacific Coast Railroad narrow gauge network completed its line from Alameda to Los Gatos, then over the mountains to Felton, absorbing the Santa Cruz & Felton to complete the line to Santa Cruz. In 1887, the Southern Pacific purchased the South Pacific Coast and converted it to standard gauge over the course of more than a decade. Washouts closed the majority of the line in 1940, and the Santa Cruz-Olympia section remained in operation to serve the timber and sand industries. In 1981, further washouts brought closure of the line from Eblis to Olympia, until the line was purchased by Norman Clark, operator of the narrow gauge Roaring Camp & Big Trees Narrow Gauge Railroad and adjacent 1880s-themed park in Felton. Local legend has it that the name \\"Roaring Camp\\" is historical too, coming from the moniker that Mexican authorities gave to what was then, in the 1840s, the wild settlement of Zayante, founded by mountain man Isaac Graham. The first train from Felton to Rincon ran in 1985 (the year after Clark's death from pneumonia that he acquired in his work to reopen this line) and the entire line to Santa Cruz was once again reopened to traffic some time later. Clark’s daughter Melani Jolley-Clark manages the company now. Trains originate at the Roaring Camp depot in Felton, but the original Southern Pacific Coast depot at New Felton (built in 1880) still stands and serves as administrative offices for the company. The freight shed, constructed from boards salvaged from the Boulder Creek to Felton log flume, is still used by the SCBT&P; as a workshop. The original Santa Cruz & Felton never crossed the San Lorenzo River and continued through the middle of the town of Felton. Locomotives The SCBT&P; utilizes two former Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe CF7 locomotives as its current motive power. These former EMD F7 units were rebuilt by the Santa Fe at their Cleburne, Texas shops to their current, more practical arrangement following the end of passenger service. Both still carry their original ATSF road numbers, #2600 and #2641. In 2013 Locomotive 2641 was named in tribute to Gene O'Lague, a long time Southern Pacific engineer who was one of the original employees of Roaring Camp. A third locomotive, a Whitcomb 45-ton diesel switcher numbered 20, was retired in 1996 and stored. Santa Cruz-Portland Cement #2, an steam locomotive built by H.K. Porter in 1906, has visited the railroad in the past. In July 2018, two additional CF7 locomotives (#2467 and #2524) were acquired from the Texas Rock Crusher Railroad.

In comparison to the neighbouring towns of Kilmaurs, Fenwick, Dunlop and Lugton, it is a relatively large town, with a population estimated of over 7,400. It is above sea level.Groome, Francis H. (1903). Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland. Pub. Caxton. London. P. 1506. The town is served by Stewarton railway station. Stewarton lies within Strathannick, with the Annick Water flowing through the town. The community is in a rural part of East Ayrshire, about north of Kilmarnock and to the East of Irvine. In the past, Stewarton served as a crossroads between the traditional routes from Kilmarnock, Irvine and Ayr to the city of Glasgow. However, in recent times, the M77 motorway has bypassed the town. The old road is known as the \\"Auld Glesga Road\\" (Or the \\"Old Glasgow Road\\") and the former name is still used by locals. History =King Malcolm Canmore and Friskin= Lainshaw Castle in 1779Ainslie, John (1779), Lainshaw Estate Map. Historical records show that Stewarton has existed since at least the 12th century with various non- historical references to the town dating to the early 11th century. The most famous of these non-historical references concerns the legend of Máel Coluim III the son of Donnchad I of Scotland who appears as a character in William Shakespeare's play Macbeth. As the legend goes, Mac Bethad had slain Donnchad to enable himself to become king of Scotland and immediately turned his attention towards Donnchad's son Máel Coluim (the next in line to the throne). When Máel Coluim learned of his father's death and Mac Bethad's intentions to murder him, he fled for the relative safety of England. Unfortunately for Máel Coluim, Mac Bethad and his associates had tracked him down and were gaining on him as he entered the estate of Corsehill on the edge of Stewarton. In panic Máel Coluim pleaded for the assistance of a nearby farmer named either Friskine or Máel Coluim (accounts differ) who was forking hay on the estate. Friskine/Máel Coluim covered Máel Coluim in hay, allowing him to escape Mac Bethad and his associates. He later found refuge with King Harthacanute, who reigned as Canute II, King of England and Norway and in 1057, after returning to Scotland and defeating Mac Bethad in the Battle of Lumphanan in 1057 to become King of Scots, he rewarded Friskine's family with the Baillie of Cunninghame to show his gratitude to the farmer who had saved his life 17 years earlier. The Cunninghame family logo now features a \\"Y\\" shaped fork with the words \\"over fork over\\" underneath - a logo which appears in various places in Stewarton, notably as the logo of the two primary schools in the area - Lainshaw primary school and Nether Robertland primary school. A natural pulpit at the old Corsehill Dam Another reference to Stewarton, this time a historical recorded version, is that one Wernebald was given the Cunninghame lands by his superior, Hugh de Morville, the builder of Kilwinning Abbey who lived at this time in Tour near Kirkland in Kilmaurs. The family were originally from Morville in Normandy (Wernebald was from Flanders) and had been established in Scotland for at least twenty years when one of the family was involved in the murder of Thomas Becket. Dervorguilla of Galloway, mother of John Balliol, was a daughter of the Morvilles on her mother's side, and when Robert the Bruce won the crown the family of Balliol lost their lands in Cunninghame. The Red Comyn, whom Bruce murdered, was a nephew of Balliol. William Cunninghame de Lamberton was Archbishop of St. Andrews and a supporter of Bruce. PontPont, Timothy (1604). Cuninghamia. Pub. Blaeu in 1654. in 1604 - 08 records that so thickly was the district about Stewarton and along the banks of the Irvine populated for a space of \\"that well traveled men in divers parts of Europe (affirm) that they have seen walled cities not so well or near planted with houses so near each other as they are here, wherethrough it is so populous that, at the ringing of a bell in the night for a few hours, there have seen convene 3000 able men, well-horsed and armed.\\"Robertson, William (1908). Ayrshire. Its History and Historic Families. Vol.1. Pub. Dunlop & Dreenan. Kilmarnock. P. 303 =The Murder of the 4th Earl of Eglinton= The restored Lainshaw House in 2007 The Mausoleum of the Cunninghames of Lainshaw in the Laigh Kirk cemetery, Stewarton Another significant event from Stewarton's history involves the Cunninghame family. In the 16th century Ayrshire was divided into three regions or bailiaries - Kyle, Carrick and Cunninghame. The two powerful families residing in Cunninghame - the Cunninghame's and the Montgomeries - had been involved in a dispute over landholdings which came to a head in 1586 when Hugh, 4th the Earl of Eglinton was attacked at the ford on the Annick Water (which flows through Stewarton) by 30 or so members of the Cunninghame clan and shot dead by John Cunninghame of Clonbeith. Hugh is said to have been on his way to attend the court of King James VI at Stirling when he decided to stop off at Langshaw House (now Lainshaw house which was for a long time a home for the elderly) to dine with his associates. The lady of the house Lady Montgomery - told several of her Cunninghame associates who lived in the area of the Earl's planned visit. As a response to the killing the Montgomery family declared they would kill every Cunninghame who had been at the river that day and a series of 'tit for tat' killings were carried out between the two families. John Cunninghame of Clonbeith was eventually slain in Hamilton, Scotland, but several of those responsible for the murder fled to Denmark and were eventually granted a pardon by King James upon his marriage to Anne of Denmark. Lady Montgomery, who was alleged to have signaled the murderers by placing a white 'napkin' on a window sill, is said to have escaped and lived with her retainer Robert Kerr at Pearce Bank (now High Peacockbank) for several years until the 'hue and cry' died down at which point she returned to the castle and was not molested on the understanding that she did not 'show her face' outside of the grounds. A path known as the 'Weeping or Mourning Path' runs upstream from the Annick (previously Annack or Annock Water) Ford and this is where the Earl's widow is said to have wept as she later followed the trail of blood left behind as his panicked horse took him away from Bridgend. The Earl's body was placed in Lainshaw Castle until arrangements were made to remove it to Eglintoun Castle. =Corsehill and Ravenscraig Castles= The name Ravenscraig or Reuincraig is derived from 'Ruin Crag', i.e. ruined castle. Godfrey de Ross and his family of Corsehill Castle were Lords of Liddesdale in the Borders and later on the Cunninghames became the holders. Corsehill (also Crosshill) castle is said to have been on the east side of the Corsehill Burn. Corsehill Castle, alias 'Ravenscraig' showing the remains left after the railway demolished most of the ruins The 1860 OS map does record the site of Templehouse which had a small fortalice associated with it and its site was at Darlington, the village which lay just beyond Stewarton on the Kingsford road before the East Burn. Corsehill castle is shown in one old print of 1691 by Gross as Corsehill House and substantial remains existed until the railway was constructed and most of the ruins were used to build the embankment. It is recorded that an avenue of trees ran down from the well planted Corsehill into Stewarton. The single tower that remains today (2006) of Ravenscraig / Corsehill was repaired to stabilise it. A View of the later property of Corsehill House in 1791 It seems that Ravenscraig and Corsehill Castles were separate entities, and that a vague memory of Templehouse and its fortalice at Darlington on the lands of Corsehill farm, may have caused some extra confusion as in the King’s Kitchen tale of the location of the Baronial residence. An area opposite the site of Templehouses was known as 'The Castle' and this may reflect the existence of the castle or fortalice here (Hewitt 2006). Archibald Adamson in his 'Rambles Round Kilmarnock' of 1875 only records three castles, these being Robertland, Auchenharvie and Corsehill. He makes no mention of the name Ravenscraig, calling the site he visited Corsehill. Aitken only marks Crosshill Castle in 1829 on the west side of the Corsehill Burn. The first OS maps show only the existing castle site, so the new survey has not perpetuate the error. To sum up, the map in Pont's 'Cuninghame' of 1604-8 shows two buildings, \\"Reuincraige\\" and \\"Corshill\\", at approximately NS 417 467 and NS 422 465 respectively, and Dobie (1876) comments that the two have often been confused, but that \\"Reuincraig\\" stood on the W of the Corsehill Burn and \\"Corsehill Mansion\\" on its E. \\"Reuincraig\\", he says, was so modernised about 1840 that it was difficult to realise that it had been ruined in 1608, while the ruins of \\"Corsehill\\" were removed about the beginning of the 19th century and only foundations could be traced when he wrote. He also thought that \\"Reuincraig\\" (i.e. Ruin Craig) was not an original name. If Dobie is correct, the ruins published as \\"Corsehill Castle\\" on the OS 6\\", must be those of \\"Reuincraig\\", both because they are standing remains, and because they are on the W bank of the burn. Macgibbon and Ross, describing \\"Corsehill Castle\\" at the end of the 19th century as a very ruinous mansion, evidently of late date and apparently of the L-plan, and ascribe it to the period 1542-1700, must be referring to \\"Reuincraig\\". Grose, in 1791, published an illustration of \\"Corshill House\\", but does not give it a close siting. As, however, he mentions that \\"at a small distance from this ruin are some small remains of a more ancient building belonging to the same family\\", he is also probably referring to \\"Reuincraig\\", the \\"small remains\\" being those of \\"Corsehill\\". (Grose 1791); (MacGibbon) and (Ross 1889). General Roy's Military Survey of Scotland (1745–55) marks 'Ravenscraig' as 'Old Corsehill' and also marks the 'new' Corsehill on the other side of the burn, thereby apparently confirming that they both had the same name and one replaced the other, although only 'Old Corsehill' is still in any way visible, just the foundations of 'new' Coresehill being apparent in 2007. The same map shows buildings named 'Temple' in the area of 'Templehouse'. = The Conventicles and the Highland host = A Covenanters ConventicleLawson, Rev. R. (1885). Maybole Past and Present. Pub.

This plant was introduced from North America in Victorian times, quite possibly at the Robertland Estate. In 1915 it was stated to have been in the area for over 60 years and was abundant on the Corsehill Burn below Robertland in 1915. As far away as Dalgarven Mill the white flowered variety still dominates. The plant is very adept at reproducing by asexual plantlets and this maintains the white gene pool around Stewarton. The pink variety has not been able to predominate here, unlike almost everywhere else in the lowlands of Scotland, England and Wales. Claytonia sibirica is a seriously destructive alien invader which should not be transplanted to other sites.

Karel, the most notable of the Koželuh family, achieved his fame as one of the first professional players in tennis, soccer, and field and ice hockey. Jan, said by some to be the most talented of them all, remained an amateur throughout his career. He was the Czech national singles and doubles champion 1925-1928 as well as a quarter-finalist at Wimbledon in 1926 and 1927. He played many matches for the Czechoslovakia Davis Cup team 1924–1930. His highest world ranking was World No. 10 in 1927. Although Karel continued to play at a top level on the professional tennis circuit until he was in his forties, Jan ended his amateur career in the mid 1930s, which many considered a mistake.

Iẓnagen, and also Aẓnaj, pl. Iẓnajen; , Ṣanhaja) were once one of the largest Berber tribal confederations, along with the Zanata and Masmuda confederations. Many tribes in Morocco, Western Sahara and Mauritania bore and still carry this ethnonym, especially in its Berber form. Other names for the population include Zenaga, Znaga, Sanhája, Sanhâdja and Senhaja. History Dance group of Sanhaja from the western Sahara at the National Folklore Festival at Marrakech After the arrival of Islam, the Sanhaja spread out to the borders of the Sudan as far as the Senegal River and the Niger. Sanhaja Berbers were a large part of the Berber population. From the 9th century, Sanhaja tribes were established in the Middle Atlas range, in the Rif Mountains and on the Atlantic coast of Morocco as well as large parts of the Sanhaja, such as the Kutâma, were settled in central and eastern parts Algeria (Kabylia, Setif, Algiers, Msila) and also in northern Niger. They played an important part in the rise of the Fatimids. The Sanhaja dynasties of the Zirids and Hammâdids controlled Ifriqiya until the 12th century. In the mid-11th century, a group of Sanhaja chieftains returning from the Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca) invited the theologian Ibn Yasin to preach among their tribes. Ibn Yasin united the tribes in the alliance of the Almoravids in the middle of the 11th century. This confederacy subsequently established Morocco, and conquered western Algeria and Al-Andalus (part of present-day Spain).Nelson 15-16 The Zenata or Sanhaja tribes would remain in roles as either exploited semi-sedentary agriculturalists and fishermen (Zenaga or Znaga tribes), or, higher up on the social ladder, as religious (Marabout or Zawiya) tribes. Though often Arabized in culture and language, they are believed to be descended from the Zenata or Sanhaja Berber population present in the area before the arrival of the Arab Maqil tribes in the 12th century, which was finally subjected to domination by Arab-descended warrior castes in the 17th century Char Bouba warhttp://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+mr0052). According to Mercer, the words Zenaga or Znaga (from the Berber root ẓnag or ẓnaj, giving the noun Aẓnag or Aẓnaj with the additional masculine singular prefix a-, or Taẓnagt or Taẓnajt with the additional feminine singular circumfix ta--t, or Iẓnagen or Iẓnajen with the additional masculine plural circumfix i--en, or Tiẓnagen or Tiẓnajen with the additional feminine plural circumfix ti--en) are thought to be a romanized distortion of Zenata and Sanhaja from Arabic. Present day Map of the Sanhaja de Srayr tribes and their respective territories in the Rif The descendants of the Sanhaja and their languages are still found today in the Middle Atlas mountains, eastern Morocco, Northern Morocco (Rif), Western Algeria, Kabylia and Kabyle territories. The Zenaga, a group believed to be of Gudala (the southernmost Sanhaja tribe) origin, inhabit southwestern Mauritania and parts of northern Senegal.

In 2013, the parish merged into the new parish Carcavelos e Parede. In 2001 its resident population was approximately 17,830 inhabitants, covering an area of 3.6 km², west of Lisbon on the coast near the mouth of the Tagus estuary. Parede is a community between the larger towns of Oeiras and Cascais, in the district of Lisbon, along the Linha do Estoril railline that follows the coast from Lisbon to Estoril and Cascais. History The places name is generally associated with the abundant rocks/boulders within the region, or the walled parcels, common until the growth of the urban settlement. Professor Diogo Correia, in his book Toponímia do Concelho de Cascais, refers to the topology in these terms: \\"In the opinion of authoritative specialists, the walls that gave the name to the homonymic settlements, were from ruined castles, dismantled redoubts, and many times, hilltop rocks. It was probably from one of these old constructions, not likely castros that fostered the name Parede, in the municipality of Cascais\\". Branca Colaço and Maria Archer, later confirm these ideas in their explanation for the locality: \\"...Parede...its old name, of three or four centuries...topology that many suggest from the many walls of loose rock, that were used to circle their properties...which even today are maintained, and that others attribute to the local terrain's structure, rich limestone in quarries, which, for centuries, were used in the construction of the walls of Lisbon\\". The occupation of Parede extends over four thousand years, although only documented references exist from the late 19th century. Although evidence of a Roman presence within the municipality exists (particularly in the civil parish of Alcabideche, Cascais, Estoril, and São Domingos de Rana), there are no similar signs of their presence in Parede. Although not explicit, there is an assumption that Roman forces used the extracted stone from the region, in many of their artefacts or buildings. Vidal de Caldas Nogueira, in articles composed in 1957, suggest that: \\"The Romans would collect the rock for their constructions, monuments and many of the inscriptions in Olissipo (Lisbon) from the quarries in Lisbon and Sintra, is not difficult to believe that this antique burgh were today exists Parede, they became active in this inscription industry from marble and granite.\\" Until 1953, the parish was part of the neighbouring civil parish of São Domingos de Rana. At that time, it received administrative autonomy, bringing with it the places of Buzano, Junqueiro, Madorna, Murtal, Penedo and Rebelva. Its limits were established under Decree 39208, 14 May 1953. Geography Parede is part of the municipality of Cascais, in the district of Lisbon in the historical province of Estremadura, pertaining to the old comarca of Cascais, and the Diocese of Lisbon. It is one of six civil parishes that comprise the municipality of Cascais, bordered on the south by the Atlantic Ocean, east by Carcavelos, north by São Domingos de Rana and in the west by Estoril. Apart from the road network, it is connected with other civil parishes by the Linha do Estoril railline which connects Cascais to Lisbon. Open and green spaces include public parks and its beachfront coastal spaces, with rocky beaches and strong biodiversity, supporting a Blue flag designation. The region is supported by many standard municipal services, including a police station, a fire department, a healthcare center, schools, a market, some banks, a supermarket, a small shopping center and many minor shops. Although two centres exist for specialized healthcare treatment, the Hospital de Santa Ana and the Hospital/Sanitario Dr. José d'Almeida (for endocrinology and ortopedy, respectively), its population has no general hospital.

History Another town named Dudley originally existed several miles north from its current location. It was founded by Labon Lewis, the son of a Revolutionary soldier, named for his deceased brother Dudley Lewis. On January 13, 1840, a post office was established for this town. This office's name was later changed to Everettsville, which was moved to a new location in 1849 and was closed in 1866. The second and present town bearing the name was set up around 1836-1840 as a camp for the Wilmington & Weldon Railroad. This time, however, it was named for Governor Edward B. Dudley, the railroad's founder. In the years in which the village grew, it gained a depot and a passenger station. Its post office was established on February 3, 1850. In December 1862, during the Battle of Goldsboro Bridge, a number of buildings and railroad cars were destroyed in Dudley by the Union Army under Maj. Gen. John G. Foster. Dudley was incorporated in 1897, with J. W. Hatch elected as the town's first mayor. The town's government lasted for many years until eventually no more officials were elected and the incorporation ended.

He enjoyed a long and fruitful professorial career spanning five decades and two coasts, teaching Old Testament at Westminster Theological Seminary (1948–77), Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary (1965–93), the Claremont School of Theology (1974–75), Reformed Theological Seminary (1979–83), and Westminster Seminary California (1981–2002). Kline was a professor emeritus at Westminster Seminary California and Gordon-Conwell until his death. He was an ordained minister in the Orthodox Presbyterian Church. Work Building on the legacy of Geerhardus Vos, Kline was an influential voice for covenant theology in the Reformed tradition, providing both new insights into biblical accounts and critical engagement with contemporary biblical scholarship. He is, perhaps, best known for his contributions on the subject of ancient suzerain–vassal treaties, specifically on the relationship of treaties from the 2nd millennium BC to covenants found in the Bible. Kline is also well known for propounding the framework interpretation of the creation account found in the first chapter of Genesis.

Little is known of Somodevilla's parents, Francisco de Somodevilla and his wife, Francisca de Bengoechea, nor is anything known of his own life prior to entering the civil administration of the Spanish navy as a clerk in 1720. He served in administrative capacities in Ceuta in that year and in the reoccupation of Oran in 1731. His ability was recognized by Don José Patiño, the chief minister of King Philip V, This includes as a footnote: For his administration see William Coxe, Memoirs of the Kings of Spain of the House of Bourbon (London, 1815), but the only complete account of Ensenada is by Don Antonio Rodriguez Villa, Don Cenón de Somodevilla, Marqués de la Ensenada (Madrid, 1878). who promoted him to supervise work at the naval arsenal at Ferrol, the main base of the Spanish Navy's Maritime Department of the North since the time of the early Bourbons. Somodevilla was also involved in the endeavors by the Spanish government to elevate the king's sons by his marriage to Elizabeth Farnese, Charles and Philip, on the thrones of Naples and Parma respectively. In 1736 Charles, afterwards King Charles III of Spain, conferred on Somodevilla the Neapolitan title of Marqués de la Ensenada. While an ensenada is a roadstead or a small bay, some of the ancestry-conscious upper-classes and nobility of the court, envious of the rise of this upstart self-made man delighted in the pun, that the name from the title can be phonetically divided into three Spanish words \\"en si nada,\\" which means \\"in himself nothing.\\" Ensenada was one of the new type of royal advisor, the talented man of no social standing.Lynch, John. Bourbon Spain, 1700-1808. Blackwell 1989, 98. In 1742 Ensenada became Secretary of State and War to Philip, duke of Parma. The following year, on April 11, 1743, after Patinos's successor Campillo died suddenly, as Marquess of Ensenada, he was chosen by Philip V as Minister of Finance, War, the Navy and the Indies (i.e. the ultramarine portion of the Spanish Empire). Ensenada met the nomination with a nolo episcopari, professing that he was incapable of filling the four posts at once. His reluctance was dismissed by the king, and he became prime minister at the age of forty-one. During the remainder of the king's reign, which lasted till July 11, 1746, and under his successor Ferdinand VI until 1754, Ensenada was the prime minister, leading the country to victory alongside France and Prussia in the War of the Austrian Succession. His administration is notable in Spanish history for the vigor of his policy of internal reform. He drew up reports on the finances and general condition of the country for the new king on his accession, and again after peace was made with Britain at Aix-la-Chapelle on October 18, 1748. Under his direction the rule of the Bourbon kings became more centralized, public works were undertaken, shipping was encouraged, trade was fostered and numbers of young Spaniards were sent abroad for education. Ensenada was a regalist, who sought to increase the power of the crown and bring the Catholic Church more under its control. He initiated reforms that \\"were intended to redefine the clergy as a professional class of spiritual specialists with fewer judicial and administrative responsiblities and less independence than in Hapsburg times.\\"Taylor, William B. Magistrates of the Sacred: Priests and Parishioners in Eighteenth-Century Mexico. Stanford: Stanford University Press 1996, p. 14.

Vol. 19 (http://www.fupress.net/index.php/cromohs/article/view/15374). Ensenada joined with Jorge Juan and Antonio de Ulloa in harsh criticism of the functioning of the Spanish Empire in Spanish America, targeting corruption and inefficiency. Juan and Ulloa's secret report was a devastating indictment of the American- born Spanish elites (criollos) and the incompetence of colonial rule. This report was to influence crown policy in what became known as the Bourbon Reforms.Brading, D.A.. The First America: The Spanish Monarchy, Creole Patriots, and the Liberal State, 1492-1867. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1991, p. 470. Ensenada was a strong supporter of a French alliance and of a policy hostile to Britain. Sir Benjamin Keene, the British minister, supported the Spanish court in opposing Ensenada, and succeeded in preventing him from adding the foreign office to the others which he held. Ensenada would probably have fallen sooner but for the support he received from the Portuguese queen, Barbara. In 1754 he offended her by opposing an exchange of Spanish and Portuguese colonial possessions in America which she favored. Following a scandal at court resulting from a conspiracy between anglophile José de Carvajal and the British ambassador to Spain, he was arrested by the king's order on July 20, 1754, and was sacked as prime minister upon Carvajal's death (see Enlightenment Spain). He was sent into mild confinement at Granada; he was afterwards allowed to relocate to Puerto de Santa Maria. On the accession of Charles III in 1759, he was released and allowed to return to Madrid. The new king named him as member of a commission appointed to reform the taxation system. Ensenada soon offended the king. On April 18, 1766 he was again exiled from court, and ordered to go to Medina del Campo. He remained here until his death on 2 December 1781 and was never again involved in public life.

History The ruins and debris of the Roman villa of Miroiço The Junta de Freguesia building of São Domingos da Rana The settlement of São Domingos de Rana, is associated with the fertility of the soils and the abundance of spring-waters: the number of archaeological vestiges in the parish implies its place in the settlement of the municipality. In many localities of the parish, human occupation has been almost permanent since the Paleolithic. The archaeological graves in the region attest to agricultural and hunting cultures. This parishes origins date to the settlement of the territory during the Paleolithic to Medieval. The first historical references originated in the Middle Age, one attesting to the existence of locality of Trajouce and the other that mentioned (in 1385) the casal in Freira. The first census referred, in 1527, referred to all the current localities in the parish. At that time, there was already a parish of São Domingos de Rana, that extended to Albarraque, expanding in 1758 to São Pedro do Estoril. Until 1838, the area was part of the municipality of Oeiras, before integrated into Cascais. For four decades the territory was exclusively agricultural, cultivating wheat, corn and vegetables, in addition to vineyards. Also, the region was known for the extraction of stone used in the construction. In 1983, professor José d’Encarnação described São Domingos de Rana as an area known of cereal harvests, but was slowly threatened by the growth of the city, and the industrial production of Abóboda. With its accelerated growth, and lack of planning, resulted in the growth of illegal barrios. On 3 March 1976, the Ministérios da Habitação, Urbanismo e Construção and Ministério dos Assuntos Sociais created an interministerial group (the Comissão para o Alojamento de Refugiados - CAR) in order to coordinate and develop solutions for the housing ex-colonial Africans and refugees, then living in emergency housing in Lisbon or along the Algarve. The development of the CAR neighbourhood of Faceiras, in three phases, began on 18 August 1977 with the construction of 81 homes. The following year (resolution 99/78) this program was integrated with other projects by the commission and the Fundo de Fomento da Habitação (FFH) (Housing Development Fund) to sustain the program (17 June 1978).On 29 May 1982, by decree 214/82 extinguished the FFH; the process continued until 1987, when the management of the fund was placed under the Comissão Liquidatária do Fundo de Fomento da Habitação (Liquidation Committee of the Housing Development Fund). Geography With , São Domingos de Rana is one of the four parishes in the municipality of Cascais. In 1970 its resident population included 18,140 inhabitants, expanding to 29,342 (in 1981), 35,938 (in 1991) and 43,991 (in 2001): the 2011, included a population of 57,502 inhabitants.

He was committed to creating books of superior quality and believed that books could be simply designed, yet beautiful. Upon his death in 1941, the Press was taken over by his partner John Bianchi, but ceased operations in 1949. Updike and his Merrymount Press left a lasting impression on the printing industry, and today Updike is considered one of the most distinguished printers of the twentieth century. Stanley Morison, the typographer responsible for creating the ubiquitous Times New Roman, had this to say of the Merrymount Press after Updike's passing: “The essential qualities of the work of the Merrymount Press...may be said without exaggeration…to have reached a higher degree of quality and consistency than that of any other printing-house of its size, and period of operation, in America or Europe.”  History  In 1892, after 12 years at Houghton Mifflin and its Riverside Press, Daniel Berkeley Updike was approached to design a new standard version of the Episcopal Church's Book of Common Prayer. The following year, work began on what would become known as the Altar Book, to be funded by Harold Brown. The commencement of Merrymount Press followed. As Updike described the Press's establishment: “In no exact sense was the Press ever founded—it only began.” Updike derived the name Merrymount from Nathaniel Hawthorne’s short story “The May-Pole of Merrymount.” The story centers on Thomas Morton's seventeenth century settlement in present-day Quincy, Massachusetts. Morton's estate was apparently the site of sports, music, and frivolity—set up in the face of his Puritanical neighbors. According to Updike, “The Press took its name from the fancy that one could work hard and have a good time.” The style of the Press developed quickly in its early years, at first imitating William Morris’s style and the Arts and Crafts movement. But where Morris’s work was decorative and heavy, Updike’s designs soon became clean and practical. By the end of the 19th century Updike had done away with designs inspired by Morris’s Gothic revival. Instead, Merrymount Press became known for its readable type and minimal decoration. This practicality could also be seen in the kinds of jobs that Updike took on, and which ultimately sustained the business. Bookplates, advertisements, concert programs, catalogs, greeting cards, periodicals, government tracts, diplomas, and more made up the bulk of the work done at Merrymount. From 1915, Updike ran the Press with John Bianchi, who had been a foreman in the workroom since Merrymount’s early days. Bianchi shared many of Updike’s same values and objectives, and was therefore made partner in 1915. Every single item produced by Merrymount was supervised by either Updike or Bianchi. After Updike’s death in 1941, Bianchi carried on the work of the Press with his son Daniel Berkeley Bianchi (named after Updike), but business dwindled and Merrymount Press ceased operations in 1949. Over the course of 56 years of operation, the Merrymount Press printed more than 20,000 items. Updike, always modest about his achievements, never attributed the Press’s success to any innate talent or instinct of his own, but to hard work and a desire to learn: “Perhaps the reason that I survived, in spite of mistakes, was that a simple idea had got hold of me—to make work better for its purpose than was commonly thought worth while…”  Typefaces Used by Merrymount Press  According to Updike's own bibliography of the Press's work, the following typefaces comprised the majority of work produced by Merrymount: * Lettre Batarde acquired 1901 * Lettre de Somme acquired 1901 * Pica English Black acquired 1898 * Janson + Janson Italic acquired 1903 * Caslon + Caslon Italic acquired 1896 * Mountjoye (Bell) + Mountjoye (Bell) Italic acquired 1903 * Oxford + Oxford Italic acquired 1906 * Scotch-Face + Scotch-Face Italic acquired 1897 * French Old Style + French Script acquired 1901 * Bodoni + Bodoni Italic acquired 1930 * Poliphilus + Blado acquired 1925 * Lutetia + Lutetia Italic acquired 1927 * Montallegro acquired 1904 * Merrymount acquired 1894 Notably, Updike was the first in America to acquire the now universal Times New Roman; its first major appearance was the December 1941 issue of Woman’s Home Companion, which was set by Merrymount. That same year, Updike used Times to print his last publication, Some Aspects of Printing Old and New.  Notable Works  Over its 56-year history, Merrymount Press produced a significant volume of ephemera, especially for local businesses and organizations. Advertisements, dinner invitations, letterhead, and the like were Merrymount's bread and butter, keeping the Press in operation. What made Updike New England's most distinguished printer, however, were the beautiful, finely printed books produced by Merrymount Press. Below is a sampling of what many consider to be the Press's most noteworthy works. = Altar Book = Merrymount's first major work was the Altar Book—begun in 1893 and completed in 1896—financed by Harold Brown. Updike attributed the establishment of Merrymount Press to the commission of the Altar Book saying, “Had I not had this definite work to do I should not have had the courage to leave my current position [at Riverside Press].” The Altar Book was set in the Press's proprietary Merrymount typeface, which was designed by Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue in 1895 and based on William Morris's Arts and Crafts style—or what Updike later called “Morris’s unduly black types.” After completing the Altar Book, Updike quickly abandoned this heavy style in favor of a cleaner, more practical look and reserved use of the Merrymount typeface for large pages as in the Altar Book. = Vexilla Regis Quotidie = Title page of Vexilla Regis Quotidie, compiled by Lucy Bradlee Stone and printed in 1893 by Merrymount Press. University of California Libraries. While the Altar Book was being prepared, Updike worked on other titles. The first of these was Vexilla Regis Quitidie, completed in 1893. The book was a selection of prayers and hymns for every day of the year compiled by Lucy Bradlee Stone. Because Merrymount had not yet acquired much type, the book was actually printed by Riverside Press, although Updike did arrange the book. = The Humanists’ Library = The Humanists’ Library, edited by Lewis Einstein, was issued in two series and was printed in the Press's proprietary Montallegro type designed by Herbert Horne. The first series was printed between 1906 and 1908, the second from 1912 to 1914. Each consisted of four titles: * Thoughts on Art and Life by Leonardo da Vinci; translated by Maurice Baring; edited by Lewis Einstein (1906) * Against War by Erasmus; edited by J.W. Mackail (1907) * Petrarch and the Ancient World by Pierre de Nolhac (1907) * The Defence of Poesie: A Letter to Q. Elizabeth and A Defence of Leicester by Sir Philip Sidney; edited by G.E. Woodberry (1908) * The Correspondence of Philip Sidney and Hubert Languet edited by William Aspenwall Bradley (1912) * Records of Journeys to Venice and the Low Countries by Albrecht Dürer; edited by Roger Fry (1913) * A Platonick Discourse upon Love by Pico della Mirandola; edited by Edmund G. Gardner (1914) * A Renaissance Courtesy Book: Galateo of Manners & Behaviours by Giovanni della Casa; introduction by J.E. Spingarn (1914) = Book of Common Prayer = In 1928, the Episcopal Church decided to issue a revision of its Book of Common Prayer, to be financed by J.P. Morgan, Jr., whose father had funded the previous revision in 1892. Morgan solicited designs from several printing houses, including the Oxford and Cambridge University Presses, William Edwin Rudge, and Merrymount Press. Updike provided two designs for the Prayer Book, one in Lutetia typeface and one in Janson; the Dutch Janson was ultimately chosen for what would become known as Merrymount's finest work. Five hundred copies were issued in November, 1930, and a year later the book was named one of the American Institute of Graphic Arts Fifty Books of the Year. = Edith Wharton = Title page of The Book of the Homeless, edited by Edith Wharton and printed in 1916 by Merrymount Press. The Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens. Updike's friendship with Edith Wharton led to a long and successful relationship between Merrymount Press and Wharton's publisher, Scribner's. When Wharton published her first book in 1899, The Greater Inclination, she insisted that Merrymount be the printer. Merrymount would print many more of Wharton's books and other titles published by Scribner's. The association was a fruitful one and vital to Merrymount's success in its early years according to Updike: “Nothing could have helped the Press more, just then, than the Scribner connection, for it showed we were not amateurs but could hold our own with larger printing houses…” In 1915, after visiting the front of World War I, Wharton began collaborating with Updike to plan a collection of original stories, essays, poems, art works, and musical scores, the profits from which would benefit the war effort. The book was published in 1916 alongside a special limited edition run of 175 copies, each signed by Updike. = Limited Editions Club = Between 1930 and 1942, Merrymount Press published eight books for The Limited Editions Club, a publisher of fine bindings. The Limited Editions Club issued just 1,500 copies per title and was available only to subscribing members. Merrymount also printed The Limited Editions Club's first prospectus, issued as a hardcover book. * 1930: The Fables of Jean de La Fontaine * 1932: The Jaunts and Jollities of Mr. John Jorrocks by R.S. Surtees * 1933: The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoevsky * 1934: A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens * 1936: Walden, or, Life in the Woods by Henry David Thoreau * 1940: Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen * 1941: The Flowering of New England by Van Wyck Brooks * 1942: The Education of Henry Adams  Artists Employed by Merrymount Press  Updike was joined by a number of artists over the years who contributed to Merrymount's distinctive look. = Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue = While employed with the architectural firm Cram & Wentworth, Bertram Goodhue designed the cover, borders, initials, and typeface for Merrymount's Altar Book—one of Merrymount's best known publications. He continued to dabble in typography and book design, but history would know him primarily as an architect. = Thomas Maitland Cleland = T.M. Cleland ran his own press, the Cornhill Press in Boston, until 1902 when he returned to New York, where he had begun his career as a freelance artist at age 15. During his time in Boston, he accepted a number of commissions from Updike, who mentored him in his early years. Among his designs for Merrymount are the cover and title page for The Poems of Dante Gabriel Rossetti in 1903, title page for The Life of Benvenuto Cellini in 1906, and many more small projects. After leaving Boston Cleland spent a year, from 1907-1908, as art director for McClure’s Magazine and was later art director for Fortune. He would go on to become known for much of his commercial art. His clients included the American Piano Company, the Cadillac Motor Company, Grolier Club, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. = William Addison Dwiggins = In 1906, W.A. Dwiggins began working for Merrymount Press on commission. A graphic artist who had studied under Frederic W. Goudy at the Frank Holme School of Illustration in Chicago, he joined Updike at a time when he was still growing as an artist. As Updike was exacting in his expectations, much of what Dwiggins submitted had to be redone or was rejected outright, but he soon become the preferred artist at Merrymount Press. Most of what Dwiggins contributed was completed between 1907 and 1912, including lettering, ornaments, borders, title pages, binding designs, endpapers, and illustrations. Some of his more notable work can be found in The Humanists’ Library series. = Rudolph Ruzicka = Rudolph Ruzicka was a Czech artist known for his wood engravings, illustrations, and typefaces. Among the titles designed and printed for The Limited Editions Club by Merrymount Press is The Fables of Jean de La Fontaine, which include decorations engraved on copper by Rudolph Ruzicka. Ruzicka provided a number of illustrations for Merrymount Press over the years, including contributing to Edith Wharton's Book of the Homeless and illustrating a book commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of Vassar College. According to Updike himself, Ruzicka's best-known works were the engravings he did for the Press's Annual Keepsakes series, beginning in 1912.  Locations of Collections  = Boston Athenæum = The Boston Athenæum maintains an extensive collection of material designed, printed, and generated by Merrymount Press, including job tickets, specimens of type, artwork, and correspondence. = Huntington Library = The Huntington Library holds the business records of the Merrymount Press and the papers of Daniel Berkeley Updike, including correspondence with authors and publishers, and bills and estimates for clients. = Providence Public Library = The Daniel Berkeley Updike Collection on the History of Printing at the Providence Public Library in Rhode Island contains Updike's personal collection of books on printing, as well as ephemera from the Merrymount Press, including a set of punches and two sets of matrices for Merrymount's proprietary types, Montallegro and Merrymount. Updike's personal correspondence, as well as books produced by Merrymount Press, also comprise the collection.  Further reading  * Hutner, Martin.

It is named after the orthopedic surgeon Gavriil Abramovich Ilizarov from the Soviet Union, who pioneered the technique. History Horse in harness with a shaft bow (decorated arch standing behind the horse's head) Ilizarov used external fixation devices on patients to treat non-unions in the 1950s. Ilizarov observed the callus formation and discovered distraction osteogenesis when one patient lengthened his frame rather than compressing it. The procedure, and the first apparatus he designed for it, was inspired by a shaft bow harness on a horse carriage (see photo to the right). Originally bicycle parts were used for the frame. The technique gained fame across the Soviet Union when he successfully treated Soviet world-record holder, and gold medalist high jumper, Valery Brumel in 1968. Brumel broke his tibia in a motorcycle accident and had 20 unsuccessful operations over a three-year period to try to repair his non-union. Ilizarov used distraction osteogenesis to heal the non-union and leg length discrepancy. Ilizarov gained more fame in 1980 when he successfully treated Italian journalist and adventurer, Carlo Mauri. Mauri had broken his leg in a skiing accident ten years earlier and his tibia never properly healed. When he was on an expedition across the Atlantic, the wound on his leg reopened and a Russian doctor advised him to see Ilizarov. When Mauri returned to Italy after his treatment, Italian doctors were impressed that his tibial non-union was repaired. They invited Ilizarov to speak at the Italian AO Conference in Bellagio. This was the first time Ilizarov spoke outside of the \\"Iron Curtain\\". The technique was brought to the US in 1987 by Victor Frankel, president of Hospital for Joint Diseases, and Dr. Stuart Green who, in 1992, edited the first English translation of Ilizarov's book. The Ilizarov external fixators can be used to correct angular deformity in the leg, to correct leg-length differences, and treat non-unions. In most developing countries it is a highly specialized technique used mainly for deformity correction by experienced surgeons due to its complexity. Further development of the ring construct led to the Taylor Spatial Frame which is more versatile and far easier to use, but very costly. Intramedullary limb lengthening devices are also available, but are also a very costly option. Mechanics and physics The device is a specialized form of external fixator, a circular fixator, modular in construction. Stainless steel (or titanium) rings are fixed to the bone via stainless heavy-gauge wire (called \\"pins\\" or Kirschner wires). The rings are connected to each other with threaded rods attached through adjustable nuts. The circular construction and tensioned wires of the Ilizarov apparatus provide far more structural support than the traditional monolateral fixator system. This allows early weightbearing. The apparatus is based on the principle which Ilizarov called \\"the theory of tensions\\". Through controlled and mechanically applied tension stress, Ilizarov was able to show that the bone and soft tissue can be made to regenerate in a reliable and reproducible manner. The top rings of the Ilizarov (fixed to the healthy bone by the tensioned wire) allow force to be transferred through the external frame (the vertical metal rods), bypassing the fracture site. Force is then transferred back to the healthy bone through the bottom ring and the tensioned wires. This allows the Ilizarov apparatus to act as a sort of bridge, both immobilizing the fracture site and relieving it of stress, while allowing for the movement of the entire limb and partial weight-bearing. Middle rings (and tensioned wires) act to hold the bone fragments in place and to give greater structural support to the apparatus and limb. However, the critical load bearing rings are the top and bottom rings which transfer the force from the healthy bone down to the healthy bone, bypassing the fracture site. Bone lengthening and reshaping In addition to being used to support a fractured limb, the Ilizarov frame is also commonly used to correct deformity through distraction osteogenesis. The procedure consists of an initial surgery, during which the bone is surgically fractured and the ring apparatus is attached. As the patient recovers, the fractured bone begins to grow together. While the bone is growing, the frame is adjusted by means of turning the nuts, thus increasing the space between two rings. As the rings are connected to opposite sides of the fracture, this adjustment, done four times a day, moves the now-healing fracture apart by approximately one millimeter per day. The incremental daily increases result in a considerable lengthening of the limb over time. Once the lengthening phase is complete, the apparatus stays on the limb for a consolidation period. The patient is able to fully weight bear on the Ilizarov frame, using crutches initially and pain is lessened. Once healing is complete, a second surgery is necessary to remove the ring apparatus. The result is a limb that is significantly longer. Additional surgery may be necessary, in the case of leg lengthening, to lengthen the Achilles tendon to accommodate the longer bone length. The major advantage of this procedure is that because the apparatus provides complete support while the bone is recovering the patient can remain active aiding recovery. A further use is in bone transport, whereby a defect in a long bone can be treated by transporting a segment of bone, whilst simultaneously lengthening regenerating bone to reduce the defect and finally dock with the other segment, producing a single bony unit. While the Ilizarov apparatus is minimally invasive (no large incisions are made), it is not free of complications. Pain is common and can be severe, but is treatable with analgesics. Careful attention to cleaning and hygiene is necessary to prevent pin site infection. Other complications include swelling, muscle transfixion, and joint contractures. Physical therapy is often indicated. Bone fracture treatment The Ilizarov method is widely used to treat complex and/or open bone fractures. This method is preferred over conventional treatment options (such as internal fixator or cast) where there is a high risk of infection or the fracture is of such severity that internal fixators are unworkable. Journalist Ed Vulliamy wrote a detailed description from the patient's viewpoint of Ilizarov apparatus treatment of a bad fracture. =Images= The following case study illustrates the Ilizarov apparatus treatment procedure for a fractured limb.

They are colloquially known as mini pills. Although such pills are sometimes called \\"progesterone-only pills\\", they do not actually contain progesterone, but one of several chemically related compounds; and there are a number of progestogen-only contraceptive formulations. Medical uses  The theoretical efficacy is similar to that of the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP). However, this pill is taken continuously without any breaks between packets, and traditional progestogen-only pills must be taken to a much stricter time every day (within 3 hours vs. a COCP's 12 hours). However, in some countries, the POP desogestrel (Cerazette) has an approved window of 12 hours. The effectiveness is, therefore, dependent upon compliance. Lacking the estrogen of combined pills, they are not associated with increased risks of deep vein thrombosis or heart disease. With the decreased clotting risk, they are not contraindicated in the setting of sickle-cell disease. The progestin-only pill is recommended over regular birth control pills for women who are breastfeeding because the mini-pill does not affect milk production (estrogen reduces the amount of breast milk). Like combined pills, the minipill decreases the likelihood of pelvic inflammatory disease. It is unclear whether POPs provide protection against ovarian cancer to the extent that COCPs do. There are fewer serious complications than with COCPs. =Available forms= Commercially available progestogen-only pills include the following common or widely used formulations: * Desogestrel 75 µg (e.g., Cerazette) * Drospirenone 4 mg (e.g., Slynd)https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2019/211367s000lbl.pdf * Norethisterone 350 µg (e.g., Micronor, Nor-QD, Noriday) And the following rare or mostly discontinued formulations: * Etynodiol diacetate 500 µg (e.g., Femulen) * Levonorgestrel 30 µg (e.g., 28 mini, Microval, Norgeston) * Lynestrenol 500 µg (e.g., Exluton, Mini-kare) * Norethisterone 300 μg (e.g., Mini-Pe) * Norgestrel 75 µg (or levonorgestrel 37.5 µg) (e.g., Minicon, Neogest, Ovrette) As well as the following completely discontinued formulations: * Chlormadinone acetate 0.5 mg * Quingestanol acetate 0.3 mg (e.g., Demovis, Pilomin) In the United States, the only progestogen-only pill that remains available is the 350-μg norethisterone formulation. Side effects * With no break in the dosage, menstrual flow does not initially occur at a predictable time. Most women tend to establish, over a few months, light to heavy spotting at approximately regular intervals. * May cause mastalgia (breast tenderness, pain) and mood swings, as well as panic attacks, anxiety and depression. * Some women may experience abdominal cramps and heavy bleeding. * May cause weight gain. * No other side effects apart from the ones mentioned above. =Breast cancer risk= Epidemiological evidence on POPs and breast cancer risk is based on much smaller populations of users and so is less conclusive than that for COCPs. In the largest (1996) reanalysis of previous studies of hormonal contraceptives and breast cancer risk, less than 1% were POP users. Current or recent POP users had a slightly increased relative risk (RR 1.17) of breast cancer diagnosis that just missed being statistically significant. The relative risk was similar to that found for current or recent COCP users (RR 1.16), and, as with COCPs, the increased relative risk decreased over time after stopping, vanished after 10 years, and was consistent with being due to earlier diagnosis or promoting the growth of a preexisting cancer. The most recent (1999) IARC evaluation of progestogen- only hormonal contraceptives reviewed the 1996 reanalysis as well as 4 case- control studies of POP users included in the reanalysis. They concluded that: \\"Overall, there was no evidence of an increased risk of breast cancer\\". Recent anxieties about the contribution of progestogens to the increased risk of breast cancer associated with HRT in postmenopausal women such as found in the WHI trials have not spread to progestogen-only contraceptive use in premenopausal women. = Depression = There is a growing body of research investigating the links between hormonal contraception, such as the progestogen-only pill, and potential adverse effects on women’s psychological health. The findings from a large Danish study of one million women (followed- up from January 2000 to December 2013) were published in 2016, and reported that the use of hormonal contraception, particularly amongst adolescents, was associated with a statistically significant increased risk of subsequent depression. The authors found that women on the progestogen-only pill in particular, were 34% more likely to subsequently take anti-depressants or be given a diagnosis of depression, in comparison with those not on hormonal contraception. In 2018, a similarly large nationwide cohort study in Sweden amongst women aged 12–30 (n=815,662) found an association, particularly amongst young adolescents (aged 12–19), between hormonal contraception and subsequent use of psychotropic drugs. Such studies highlight the need for further research into the influence of hormonal contraception, including the progestogen-only pill on women’s psychological health. =Weight gain= There is some evidence that progestin-only contraceptives may lead to slight weight gain (on average less than 2 kg in the first year) compared to women not using any hormonal contraception. Mechanism of action The mechanism of action of progestogen-only contraceptives depends on the progestogen activity and dose. * Very-low-dose progestogen-only contraceptives, such as traditional progestogen-only pills (and subdermal implants Norplant and Jadelle and intrauterine systems Progestasert and Mirena), inconsistently inhibit ovulation in ~50% of cycles and rely mainly on their progestogenic effect of thickening the cervical mucus, thereby reducing sperm viability and penetration. * Intermediate-dose progestogen-only contraceptives, such as the progestogen-only pill Cerazette (or the subdermal implant Nexplanon), allow some follicular development (part of the steps of ovulation) but much more consistently inhibit ovulation in 97–99% of cycles. The same cervical mucus changes occur as with very-low-dose progestogens. * High-dose progestogen-only contraceptives, such as the injectables Depo-Provera and Noristerat, completely inhibit follicular development and ovulation. The same cervical mucus changes occur as with very-low-dose and intermediate-dose progestogens. In anovulatory cycles using progestogen-only contraceptives, the endometrium is thin and atrophic. If the endometrium were also thin and atrophic during an ovulatory cycle, this could, in theory, interfere with implantation of a blastocyst (embryo). History The first POP to be introduced contained 0.5 mg chlormadinone acetate and was marketed in Mexico and France in 1968. However, it was withdrawn in 1970 due to safety concerns pertaining to long- term animal toxicity studies. Subsequently, levonorgestrel 30 µg (brand name Microval) was marketed in Germany in 1971. It was followed by a number of other POPs shortly thereafter in the early 1970s, including etynodiol diacetate, lynestrenol, norethisterone, norgestrel, and quingestanol acetate. Desogestrel 75 µg (brand name Cerzette) was marketed in Europe in 2002 and was the most recent POP to be introduced. It differs from earlier POPs in that it is able to inhibit ovulation in 97% of cycles.

Begun near the city of Basra in present-day southern Iraq and led by one Ali ibn Muhammad, the insurrection involved enslaved Bantu-speaking people (Zanj) who had originally been captured from the coast of East Africa and transported to the Middle East, principally to drain the region's salt marshes. It grew to involve slaves and freemen, including both blacks and Arabs, from several regions of the Caliphate, and claimed tens of thousands of lives before it was finally defeated. Several Muslim historians, such as al-Tabari and al-Mas'udi, consider the Zanj revolt to be one of the \\"most vicious and brutal uprisings\\" of the many disturbances that plagued the Abbasid central government. Modern scholars have characterized the conflict as being \\"one of the bloodiest and most destructive rebellions which the history of Western Asia records,\\" while at the same time praising its coverage as being among the \\"most fully and extensively described campaign[s] in the whole of early Islamic historical writing.\\" The precise composition of the rebels remains a subject of debate, both as regards their identity and as to the proportion of slaves and free among them – available historical sources being open to various interpretations. Background Marshland around Basra, southern Iraq. The Zanj were Bantu-speaking slaves who had been forcibly taken from Africa and who were primarily used for agricultural labor as part of the plantation economy of southern Iraq. The demand for servile labor during this period was fueled by wealthy residents of the port city of Basra, who had acquired extensive marshlands in the surrounding region. These lands had been abandoned as a result of peasant migration and repeated flooding over time, but they could be converted back into cultivatable status through intensive labor.; ; ; ; Local magnates were able to gain ownership of this land on the condition that they would make it arable. As a result, they acquired large numbers of Zanj and other slaves, who were placed into work camps and tasked with clearing away the nitrous topsoil as part of the reclamation process. Other Zanj were used to work in the salt flats of lower Iraq, especially in the area around Basra. Both the working and living conditions of the Zanj were considered to be extremely miserable. The menial labor they were engaged in was difficult and the slaves appear to have been poorly treated by their masters.; ; ; Two previous attempts to rebel against these circumstances are known to have occurred in 689–90 and in 694. Both of these revolts had quickly failed and thereafter little is known about their history prior to 869. Beginning in 861, the Abbasid Caliphate was weakened by a period of severe disorder known as the Anarchy at Samarra, during which the central government in Abbasid Samarra was paralyzed by a struggle between the caliphs and the military establishment for control of the state. Throughout the 860s the various factions in the capital were distracted by this conflict, which resulted in the deaths of several caliphs, army commanders and bureaucrats, the outbreak of multiple troop riots, a damaging civil war in 865–866, and the virtual bankruptcy of the government.; The anarchy in Samarra allowed a number of provinces to fall into the hands of rebels, while provincial governors were free to act in an independent manner in the territories assigned to them. The effective loss of provinces, in turn, resulted in a decrease in taxation revenues received by the central government, further exacerbating the crisis in the capital and crippling the government's ability to effectively respond to challenges against its authority. This continuing instability greatly facilitated the initial success of the Zanj revolt, as the government proved incapable of committing sufficient troops and resources to subdue the rebels. Ali ibn Muhammad A modern map of the Mesopotamian Marshes. The leader of the revolt was a Ali ibn Muhammad, an Islamic scholar of uncertain background. Little is known about his family or early life due to a scarcity of information and conflicting accounts. According to one version, his paternal grandfather was descended from the Abd al-Qays and his paternal grandmother was a Sindhi slave woman, while his mother, a free woman, was a member of the Banu Asad ibn Khuzaymah. Some later commentators have presumed him to have been of Persian rather than Arab background, but other historians consider this to be unlikely. Ali himself claimed to have been descended from Ali ibn Abi Talib, the son-in-law of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and fourth caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate, but this was largely rejected by Muslim historians of the era as false.; ; ; ; Regardless of his origins, Ali appears to have spent at least a part of his youth living in the area of Rayy, and at an unspecified date he moved to the Abbasid capital of Samarra, where he mixed with some of the influential slaves of Caliph al-Muntasir (861-62). In 863, he made his way from Samarra to Bahrain (modern eastern Arabia), where he pretended to be Shi'i and started to rouse the people into rebellion against the caliphate. Support for his cause quickly grew. A large number of Bahranis submitted to his authority and the kharaj (land taxes) were collected in his name. Despite this, his rebellion eventually failed due to opposition from the local inhabitants, whereupon Ali abandoned the region and relocated to the city of Basra in southern Iraq in 868.; ; In Basra Ali sought to take advantage of disturbances caused by the city's rival groups, the Bilaliyyah and Sa'diyyah, and attempted to secure the support of one of the factions. Eventually he proclaimed a new revolt, but no one in the city rallied to his side and he was forced to flee to the marshlands of southern Iraq. There he was arrested by the provincial authorities and sent to Wasit. He was quickly able to secure his freedom and went to Baghdad, where he remained for the next year. During his time in Baghdad he claimed to be a Zaydi by being related to the grandson of Zayd ibn Ali and won over additional followers for his movement.; ; When Ali heard news about another scuffle between Basra's factions in 869, he returned to the region and \\"began to seek out black slaves working in the Basra marshes and to inquire into their working conditions and nutritional standards.\\" He began a campaign to liberate and recruit Zanj and other slaves, promising them wealth, affluence and prosperity in exchange for their support. A trifling number of people quickly joined his cause, and Ali soon came to be known by the title Sāhib az-Zanj, meaning \\"Chief of the Zanj\\". However, Ali's movement attracted not only Zanj but many other people of different social groups. These included \\"semi-liberated slaves, clients of prestigious families, a number of small craftsmen and humble workers, some peasantry and some Bedouin peoples who lived around Basrah.\\" While he was gaining followers for his rebellion, Ali adopted slogans of the egalitarian doctrine of the Kharijites, who \\"preached that the most qualified man should reign, even if he was an Abyssinian slave.\\" He inscribed his banner and coins with Kharijite expressions; and started off his Friday sermons with the slogan \\"God is great, God is great, there is no God but God, and God is great; there is no arbitration except by God,\\" which was \\"the war cry used by the Kharijites when they defected from the ranks of Ali ibn Abi Talib during the battle of Siffin.\\" At the same time, however, Ali did not completely abandon the pretense of being an Alid and maintained the claim that he was a Zaydi. Revolt Riverine warfare on the regional waterways was a major aspect of the revolt The revolt, which began in September 869, was concentrated in the districts of Iraq and al-Ahwaz (modern Khuzestan Province) in the central regions of the Abbasid Caliphate. Over the course of the next fourteen years, the Zanj were able to combat the superior arms of the Abbasid government by waging guerrilla warfare against their opponents. They became adept at raiding towns, villages and enemy camps (often at night), seizing weapons, horses, food and captives and freeing fellow slaves, and burning the rest to cinders to delay retaliation.; As the rebellion grew in strength, they also constructed fortresses, built up a navy for traversing the canals and rivers of the region, collected taxes in territories under their control, and minted their own coins.; In its initial stages, the rebellion was limited to the region around the city of Basra and the Blind Tigris. Early efforts by the Abbasid government to crush the revolt proved ineffectual, and several towns and villages were occupied or sacked, including al-Ubulla in 870 and Suq al-Ahwaz in 871. Basra fell in September 871 following an extended blockade, resulting in the city being burned and its inhabitants massacred. A retaliatory campaign undertaken by the caliphal regent Abu Ahmad ibn al-Mutawakkil (known by his honorific of al-Muwaffaq) against the rebels in 872 ended in failure, and the Zanj remained on the offensive over the next several years.; ; ; The continuing inability of the Abbasid army to suppress the revolt, caused in part by its preoccupation with fighting against the Saffarid Ya'qub ibn al-Layth's advance into al-Ahwaz and Iraq, eventually encouraged the Zanj to expand their activities to the north. A campaign by the rebels to occupy the marshlands between Basra and Wasit in 876 proved successful, and soon they made their way into the district of Kaskar. By 879, the rebellion reached its furthest extent. Wasit and Ramhurmuz were sacked and the rebels advanced northwest along the Tigris, coming to within fifty miles of Baghdad.; ; ; ; The Abbasid government regained the initiative in the war in late 879, when al-Muwaffaq sent his son Abu al-'Abbas (the future caliph al-Mu'tadid) with a major force against the rebels. Al- Muwaffaq himself joined the offensive in the following year, and over the next several months the government forces succeeded in clearing the rebels out of the districts of Iraq and al-Ahwaz and driving them back toward their \\"capital\\" of al-Mukhtarah, to the south of Basra.; ; ; Al-Mukhtarah was placed under siege in February 881, and over the next two and half years a policy by al-Muwaffaq of offering generous terms to anyone that voluntarily submitted convinced many of the rebels to abandon the struggle. The fall of al-Mukhtarah in August 883, combined with the death or capture of Ali ibn Muhammad and most of the rebel commanders, brought the revolt to an end, and the remaining rebels either surrendered to the government or were killed. Consequences The number of people killed in the conflict is difficult to estimate; contemporary writers gave widely variable figures, and these are considered by modern historians to be gross exaggerations. Al-Mas'udi reported a \\"moderate\\" estimate of 500,000 casualties – though he added a clarification that this was \\"empty conjecture - rigorous calculation [of the amount slain] is impossible\\" – and separately noted that 300,000 were killed at the battle of Basra. Al-Suli gave a figure of 1,500,000 dead, which was subsequently quoted by multiple sources, while Ibn al-Taqtaqi provided a high-end number of 2,500,000. Al-Tabari's History contains no comprehensive figures, but the author frequently noted the number of soldiers killed or injured in individual battles, with amounts ranging from hundreds to thousands.See for example ; The rebellion greatly disrupted economic activity and caused extensive damage to the districts it took place in. Sources of the revolt describe burnt cities and towns, the seizure of food and other resources by advancing armies, the abandonment of lands and the cessation of agricultural activity, disruptions in the regional trade, and the damaging of bridges and canals in the name of military exigency.; ; ; Shortages of basic necessities, such as food and water, at times became severe, and instances of cannibalism are reported to have occurred.; Both the rebels and their opponents engaged in looting, destroying supplies that were likely to fall into enemy hands, and massacring or executing captives.Al-Tabari's account contains numerous examples of these activities; see for example ; The long term effects of the revolt, on the other hand, are more difficult to ascertain and opinions by modern historians vary; some like Bernard Lewis believe that the rebellion resulted in no significant changes, while others such as Theodor Nöldeke argue that the regions devastated by the conflict never fully recovered afterward.; ; The significant arms and resources that the Abbasid government was required to throw against the Zanj meant that it was forced to divert its attention from other fronts for the duration of the conflict, resulting in the effective loss of several provinces. Ahmad ibn Tulun, the Tulunid governor of Egypt, was able to take advantage of the Abbasids' preoccupation with the Zanj and forge a de facto independent state which would survive for more than three decades, while the Saffarids Ya'qub ibn al-Layth and Amr ibn al-Layth seized several of the eastern provinces and faced no serious opposition from the central government until Ya'qub's attempt to march on Iraq itself in 876. The revolt may have also affected the government's ability to defend against the Byzantines, who scored several successes on the Anatolian frontier during this period, and possibly even indirectly contributed to the rise of the Qarmatians of Bahrain a few years later. Historiography The interior of a mudhif, a traditional Marsh Arab guesthouse made entirely out of reeds. Ghada Hashem Talhami, a scholar of the Zanj rebellion, argues that modern views of the revolt are distorted by mistakenly equating the Zanj with East Africans. The assumption that Abbasid writers exclusively used the term \\"Zanj\\" to mean specifically the East African coast, and that therefore the people they called Zanj originated from a specific part of that region, is unsupported by contemporary sources due to their silence on the existence of an East African slave trade in this period, as well as by their occasional use of the term to mean \\"blacks\\" or \\"Africa\\" in general. Talhami cites from various historians and works to make her point that the rebellion was more of a religious/social uprising made by the lowly classed and suppressed citizens of the Basra area, which included a wide variety of people, including slaves of indeterminate origin. She points out that the sources specifically state that the people referred to as \\"Zanj\\" were not the only participants of the revolt, but were joined by Bahranis, Bedouins and others from the Basra region; moreover, they give no explicit indication that the Zanj even constituted a majority of the rebels. Historian M. A. Shaban has argued that rebellion was not a slave revolt, but a revolt of blacks (zanj). In his opinion, although a few runaway slaves did join the revolt, the majority of the participants were Arabs and free East Africans, and if the revolt had been led by slaves, they would have lacked the necessary resources to combat the Abbasid government for as long as they did. =Sources of information= Much of the current knowledge of the Zanj Rebellion comes from the historian al-Tabari's work History of the Prophets and Kings. It has been the subject of research by such famous Orientalists as Theodor Nöldeke (Sketches from Eastern History) and Louis Massignon (The Passion of al- Hallaj). Alexandre Popović has authored a more recent monograph on the subject.

Geography  Petrie is in the North Pine River section of its local government area 24 kilometres north of Brisbane City. The southern boundary is marked by the North Pine River. Petrie is a suburban village with new housing developments on land which was previously used for pine plantations and agriculture. Petrie railway station provides access to regular Queensland Rail City network services to Brisbane and Ipswich, as well as Caboolture and the Sunshine Coast. There are also commuter rail services to Kippa-Ring (Redcllife) via the newly built Redcliffe branch railway line. The Gympie Road, Dayboro Road and Anzac Avenue roundabout junction and surrounding area encompass the town centre which includes establishments, such as retail, commerce, cosmetology, health, education, sport and mechanical industries and establishments. There are also police, fire brigade and ambulance establishments in the town centre. The University of the Sunshine Coast Moreton Bay campus is situated in Petrie on the site of the former Amcor Paper Mill.

History  There are varied accounts as to when exactly the main tower/keep was constructed; ranging anywhere from the 13th century to the late 15th century,https://www.tipperary.com/leap-castle but most likely around 1250 CE. It was built by the O'Bannon clan and was originally called \\"Léim Uí Bhanáin\\" (as was the fertile land around the castle which was associated with the Bannon clan), or \\"Leap of the O'Bannons\\". The O'Bannons were the \\"secondary chieftains\\" of the territory and were subject to the ruling O'Carroll clan. There is evidence that it was constructed on the same site as another ancient stone structure perhaps ceremonial in nature, and that that area has been occupied consistently since at least the Iron Age (500 BCE) and possibly since Neolithic times. The Annals of the Four Masters record that the Earl of Kildare, Gerald FitzGerald, tried unsuccessfully to seize the castle in 1513. Three years later, he attacked the castle again and managed to partially demolish it. However, by 1557 the O'Carrolls had regained possession. Following the death of Mulrooney O'Carroll in 1532, family struggles plagued the O'Carroll clan. A fierce rivalry for the leadership erupted within the family. The bitter fight for power turned brother against brother. One of the brothers was a priest. While he was holding mass for a group of his family (in what is now called the \\"Bloody Chapel\\"), his rival brother burst into the chapel, plunged his sword into him and fatally wounded him. The butchered priest fell across the altar and died in front of his family.Leap Castle In 1659, the castle passed by marriage into the ownership of the Darby family, notable members of whom included Vice-Admiral George Darby, Admiral Sir Henry D'Esterre Darby and John Nelson Darby. During the tenure of Jonathan Charles Darby, séances were held in the castle by his wife Mildred Darby who was a writer of Gothic novels: this led to publicity about the castle and its ghosts. The central keep was later expanded with significant extensions, but in order to pay for these, rents were raised and much of the land accompanying the castle was sold. This is one theorised motivation for the burning of the castle during the Irish Civil War in 1922. After its destruction, Mr. Darby obtained a reinstatement estimate from Beckett & Medcalf, surveyors in Dublin, that was issued in September 1922. Confusingly, it gives the address as Leap Castle, Roscrea, Co. Tipperary. The net \\"Amount of Claim\\" was £22,684.19.1, equivalent to about €1m in 2018. The claim was settled for a lesser amount.http://landedestates.nuigalway.ie/LandedEstates/jsp/estate- show.jsp?id=3434 In 1974 the now ruined castle was bought by Australian historian Peter Bartlett, whose mother had been a Banon. Bartlett, together with builder Joe Sullivan, carried out extensive restoration work on the castle up to the time of his death in 1989.Bartlett's biographical materials, including Leap Castle restoration details - National Library of Australia Since 1991, the castle has been privately owned by musician Seán Ryan and his wife Anne who continue the restoration work.  Oubliette  The oubliette During renovation of the castle in the 1900s, workers found an oubliette behind a wall in the chapel. At the bottom of the shaft were many human skeletons amassed on wooden spikes. When cleaned out, it took three cartloads to remove the bones. Today, the dungeon is now covered over in order to keep people away from it. It is believed that the O’Carrolls would drop guests through the trap door to be impaled on the spikes 8 feet below. A pocket watch found at the same time, dating from the mid 1800s, shows how recently the oubliette may have been used.

There are many different variations of this form of dice chess.John Gollon, Chess Variations: Ancient, Regional, and Modern, Charles E. Tuttle Company, 1974, pp. 231–32. . One of them is described here. Rules The players alternate rolling the dice and, if possible, moving. On each die, the 1 represents a pawn, 2 a knight, 3 a bishop, 4 a rook, 5 a queen, and 6 a king. The player may move either of the pieces indicated on the two dice. For example, a player rolling a 1 and a 2 may move either a pawn or a knight. A player who rolls doubles (the same number on both dice) may play any legal move. Otherwise, standard chess rules apply, with these exceptions: * a player who has no legal move with either of the pieces indicated by the dice loses that turn (passed turn); * if castling is otherwise legal, a player may castle upon rolling a 4, 6, or doubles; * an en passant capture of a pawn is possible only if the player rolls a 1, or doubles, immediately once the opportunity for the en passant capture arises; * a player who is in check can only play a legal response to that check (capturing the checking piece, moving the king, or interposing a piece); * a player who is in check but does not make a roll allowing a legal response to the check loses that turn, but does not automatically lose the game; * except in the unlikely event that the game ends in a draw pursuant to the standard rules of chess, the game ends when one player either checkmates the opponent or captures the opponent's king. Sample game Here is a sample game of dice chess: :White rolls doubles, allowing her to play any move, and selects 1.e4. Black rolls a 2 and a 3; no bishop move being possible, he plays 1...Nc6. White rolls a 3 and a 4, and plays 2.Bc4. Black rolls a 4 and a 5; since no queen move is possible, he must play the only legal rook move, 2...Rb8. White rolls a 3 and a 6, and plays 3.Bxf7+. Black rolls a 2 and a 4; since no knight or rook move is a legal response to the check, he must pass. (Only a 6, or doubles, would have allowed him to move.) White rolls a 2 and a 4, and chooses 4.Nf3. (A 3 or 5 would have enabled an immediate win with 4.Bxe8, 4.Qf3 or 4.Qh5#). Black rolls a 1 and a 3; again, this does not allow a legal response to the check, so he must pass. White rolls a 2 and a 4, and plays 5.Ng5#, ending the game (see diagram). Rules variants There is no standard for dice chess, and so games called dice chess may have different rules to the ones given here. For example, in the version of dice chess given on the BrainKing site:BrainKing Dice Chess rules * The players roll only one die. * Pawns may move from the seventh to the eighth rank not only on a roll of 1 (when they promote to a piece of the player's choice), but also on a roll of 2, 3, 4 or 5 (when they can promote only to the piece specified by the roll). * There is no check or checkmate. Rather, the goal is to actually capture the king. Another form of dice chess is Vegas Fun Chess, whose rules are described on The Chess Variant Pages. That site also states that \\"Pritchard's Encyclopedia of Chess Variants contains descriptions of seven versions of what he calls 'Dice Chess'.\\" John Gollon, in his book Chess Variations: Ancient, Regional, and Modern, notes three ways in which dice may be used in connection with a game of chess. The most common is similar to that described in the preceding sections. A second way to use dice is to have each player roll one die on each turn, with the number rolled indicating the number of moves to be played. The maximum number of moves that can be played is usually four, so a roll of a 4, 5, or 6 allows the player to make four moves. A third form of the game uses two dice of contrasting colors, with one determining the piece that can move, and the other the number of moves that the piece makes. History Anne Sunnucks writes that there is evidence from the literature of the period that dice were used to play chess in Europe between the 11th and 14th centuries, and even earlier in Burma and India. The dice were thrown before each turn to determine the piece to be moved; the same numbering system as set forth above was used (1=pawn, 2=knight, etc.).Anne Sunnucks, The Encyclopaedia of Chess, St. Martin's Press, 1970, pp. 97–98. Sunnucks does not make clear if only one die or both dice were thrown, and, if the latter, whether the player could choose which of the specified pieces to move. In the Burmese form of the game, three dice were thrown and each player made three moves at a time.Sunnucks, p. 98. Vladimir Pribylinec writes that the cubes in Cubic Chess move as in orthochess by a symbol uppermost as is described in both editions of Pritchard's Encyclopedia of Chess Variants, first published in 1977. In the variant Protheus cubes are turned on the adjacent squares.

She was one of only three Royal Navy ships to be equipped with the Rupertinoe naval gun.Spencer, p.351; Endsor, p.9. Life aboard her when cruising in the Mediterranean Sea in 1679 is described in the diary of Henry Teonge. She was rebuilt at Chatham Dockyard in 1690 as a 70-gun third rate. On 24 August 1704, Royal Oak participated in the Battle of Vélez-Málaga, in the centre division of the combined English-Dutch fleet under Admiral George Rooke. She was rebuilt a second time at Woolwich Dockyard, relaunching on 14 May 1713 as a 70-gun third rate built to the 1706 Establishment. She fought off Forbin's squadron during the Action of 2 May 1707, and was also present in the Battle at The Lizard. Under the command of Captain Thomas Kempthorne, Royal Oak took part in the Battle of Cape Passaro on 11 August 1718 as part of Admiral Sir George Byng's fleet. On 8 March 1737 she was ordered to be taken to pieces at Plymouth, and rebuilt as a 70-gun ship according to the 1733 proposals of the 1719 Establishment. She was relaunched on 29 August 1741. Captain Philip Vincent took command and the ship was assigned to the Mediterranean with Rear Admiral Richard Lestock's squadron. Vincent was succeeded by Captain Edmund Willams, Captain Charles Long and finally Captain James Hodsall. Royal Oak was converted to serve as a prison ship at Plymouth in 1756.Ships of the Old Navy, Royal Oak (1741) The ship was the scene of an incident in January 1759 in which a French prisoner, Jean Manaux, told the warden that his fellow prisoners were forging passes. His fellow prisoners discovered this and, on 25 January, dragged him to a remote part of the ship, gave him approximately 60 strokes with a large iron thimble tied to a rope, then beat him to death after he struggled from his bonds. They dismembered his body in an attempt to dispose of it. At an inquest ashore the next day, one of the prisoners provided information on the murder, which resulted in the hanging of Charles Darras, Louis Bourdec, Fleurant Termineu, Pierre Pitroll and Pierre Lagnal on April 25 at Exeter.

His poems, frequently placed in the mouth of women, stylize peasant-life songs and idealize agricultural labour. Koltsov earnestly collected Russian folklore which strongly influenced his poetry. He celebrated simple peasants, their work and their lives. Many of his poems were put to music by such composers as Dargomyzhsky, Mussorgsky, and Rimsky-Korsakov. Biography He was born in Voronezh as a son of a cattle merchant. Having studied for less than two years at a local school (1818-1820), Aleksey quit at the insistence of his father who wanted his help with his business. Koltsov moved, bought and sold cattle; and in the meantime, wrote poems secretly from his father. The first serious introduction of his poetry occurred in 1831, when Nikolai Stankevich, a poet and philosopher from Moscow, published several poems in \\"Literaturnaya gazeta\\" (Literary newspaper) with a short introduction. In 1835, his first collection of poetry was published. Koltsov often traveled on business to St. Petersburg and Moscow, where he met Belinsky, who became his mentor, as well as Vasily Zhukovsky, Pyotr Vyazemsky, Vladimir Odoevsky, and Aleksandr Pushkin, who published one of Koltsov's poems in his journal \\"Sovremennik\\". Koltsov's father constantly and cruelly controlled his life, suppressing Aleksey's creative writing and his personal life. Weakened by depression and a year-long tuberculosis, Koltsov died in 1842 at the age 33. He was buried in Voronezh.

(2003) Cyprus Lonely Planet, Oakland, California, pp. 121-122, an area known as the Ktima Lowlands. In 1980 the population of the village was 700 people.Robertson, Ian (1981) Cyprus Rand McNally, London, p. 140, Kissonerga is about eight kilometres down the main road from Paphos towards Coral Bay.Daniel, Geoff (2004) Landscapes of Cyprus: A Countryside Guide Sunflower, London, p. 74, Along the coast road are several hotels, mini-markets, numerous bars and taverns, as well as small complexes of shops mainly catering for tourists. The village is located 112 metres above sea level. Away from the coast road, Kissonerga village has a main street where there are restaurants, several mini-markets, two banks, two coffee shops (one of which also operates as a sub post office), a bookshop, florist, chemist and hairdressers. There is also an internet café near the playground. Kissonerga has a collection of holiday homes named Juliepapas Gardens which is in the suburbs and is signposted off the coastal road. At the far end of the main street, opposite the school, which caters for children from nursery age to 11 years old, there is a communal area which is mainly used as a playground. Bordering this area is a monument dedicated to two young men of the village, Christos Miltiadous Kkelis (23) and Georgios Michalis (17) who were members of EOKA (National Organisation of Cypriot Fighters) and who died for their cause. The inscriptions read - ΑΓΩΝΙΣΤΗΣ ΤΗΣ ΕΟΚΑ 1955-59 ΕΠΕΣΕ ΜΑΧΟΜΕΝΟΣ ΥΠΕΡ ΠΙΣΤΕΩΣ ΚΑΙ ΠΑΤΡΙΔΟΣ (EOKA FIGHTER OF 1955-59 - FELL FIGHTING FOR FAITH AND HOMELAND). The main street that runs through Kissonerga is named after Kkelis. EOKA started a guerrilla campaign against British colonial rule and aimed at union with Greece (Enosis) on 1 April 1955. The campaign lasted until 1959 and caused the deaths of more Greek Cypriot civilians than British colonialists. It created civil strife and mistrust between the two Cypriot communities. The first British soldier to be killed in the conflict, Lance Corporal A. R. L. Milne, was killed in Kissonerga when a bomb was thrown into his vehicle.Barker, Dudley (1960) Grivas: Portrait of a Terrorist Harcourt, Brace & World, New York, p. 107, OCLC 1374013 Across the road from the playground is the Church of the Transfiguration (also known as Metamorphosis) and not far from this church are the ruins of a tiny chapel dedicated to Saints Zinovia and Filonilli. Although of modern architecture, the church the icons from the church of 1775 are preserved. These two saints accompanied St Paul to Paphos to help spread Christianity. They died and were buried in Kissonerga. To the north of Kissonerga a new football stadium has recently been built in amongst the numerous plantations of bananas. Before the advent of European Union directives, Kissonerga was awash with these thriving plantations, but now many of them have fallen into decay as the bananas produced did not fit the exacting criteria that allowed them to be exported to other parts of the EU. Among the establishments to be found in Kissonerga, are a horse-riding centreDubin, Marc (2002) The Rough Guide to Cyprus Rough Guides, London, p. 170, and the boat yard which sells, repairs and services boats of all shapes and sizes. Construction of Paphos Marina was long planned for the Potima Bay area, located to the north of Kissonerga. The marina will be the largest in the Eastern Mediterranean and will have a capacity to accommodate 1.000 vessels. Construction began in 2009. Myluthkia To the north of Kissonerga a rare settlement of the Chalcolithic culture characteristic of the Paphos region, which lasted for about a millennium (3500-2500 BCE), has been discovered. The site is an important settlement and evidence suggests that a powerful fertility goddess was worshipped here, who protected childbirth and infants. Among the many artefacts found was a clay figurine of a woman, in the midst of childbirth, seated on a stool as well as a unique limestone statuette representing a pregnant woman with a phallic neck. The village consisted of clusters of round houses (some of which have been reconstructed on the site) built of stone and mud and with no defensive walls. Its inhabitants lived on hunting, fishing, herding and the gathering and growing various plants. They made tools of stone, bone and deer antler and knew how to make pottery, stone and wood carving, weaving, and basketry. They also used a few small copper objects. Expert analysis of human remains found at the site confirm the existence of thalassaemia, a blood disorder which affects the production of haemoglobin and results in severe anaemia. The disorder is passed from parent to child via genes and is the most common inherited blood disorder in the world. Thalassaemia is particularly prevalent in people from Mediterranean countries and a broad region extending across the Middle East and South East Asia.

Geography The locality includes the dam wall and associated water management infrastructure at the south, the lake created by the dam, sections of the Brisbane and Stanley Rivers as they flow into the lake from the north and a narrow strip of land around the dam, the lake and river the sections. The lake's boundaries are very irregular and this is reflected in the very irregular boundaries of the locality. The locality is entirely set aside for water management purposes. Due to its unusual shape, Lake Wivenhoe has many adjacent localities including (commencing from the dam wall in the south and proceeding clockwise: Wivenhoe Pocket, Patrick Estate, Wivenhoe Hill, Coominya, Moombra, Glen Esk, Murrumba, Coal Creek, Caboonbah, Mount Beppo, Cressbrook, Lower Cressbrook, Cooeeimbardi, Somerset Dam, Crossdale, Bryden, Dundas, and Split Yard Creek. The Brisbane Valley Highway passes through the south of the locality as it travels across the top of the dam wall. Etymology The name Wivenhoe comes from the name of the pastoral property established circa 1845 by Edmund Blucher Uhr, which took its name from the town of Wivenhoe in Essex, England. Heritage listings Caboonbah homestead, 2009 Lake Wivenhoe has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Esk-Kilcoy Road: Caboonbah Homestead Amenities Although it is not a populated area, Lake Wivenhoe offers a range of outdoor recreational facilities for camping, picnics, swimming, fishing and water sports. Camping sites are provided at Captain Logan and Lumley Hill Areas. The managed camping facilities at Captain Logan Camp include hot showers, barbecues and toilets, and are adjacent to playgrounds and a boat ramp at Logan Inlet. Cormorant Bay, Hamon Cove and Spillway Common also have facilities for picnic. A stocked impoundment permit is required to fish in the dam. Swimming is permitted and camp sites have been established. Electric and non-powered boating with a permit is allowed, but domestic animals are banned. The heritage-listed Caboonbah Homestead was located on to the north-west of the lake (near but not within the locality of Caboonbah) where it was a tourist attraction operated by the Brisbane Valley Historical Society until the homestead burned down in 2009.

He is best known for commanding a naval squadron which was wrecked with three German warships at Apia, Samoa in 1889. Biography After graduating from the Naval Academy in June 1859, he served with the Africa Squadron until September 1861 when he sailed a prize slaver home to the United States. Lieutenant Farquhar spent most of the Civil War off the U.S. Atlantic coast and in the West Indies, serving in the gunboats , and , and the cruiser . At the close of the war, he was executive officer of the gunboat . He was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Commander in August 1865, a few months after the fighting ended, and was on duty at the U.S. Naval Academy from then until September 1868. For the rest of the 1860s and into the next decade, Farquhar served in the screw sloop , was Executive Officer of the sloop and the frigate , and Commanding Officer of the gunboat . He also had two tours at the Boston Navy Yard on ordnance duty and as Executive Officer. Advanced in rank to Commander in December 1872, Farquhar spent nearly five years at the Naval Academy. He commanded the training ship in 1877-78, and the steam sloops and in European waters in 1878-1881. Five more years of Naval Academy duty were followed by torpedo instruction at Newport, Rhode Island, in 1886. From May 1887 until her loss in the March 1889 Samoan hurricane, Captain Farquhar commanded the steam frigate . Farquhar was commended for his fine handling of his ship during that disastrous 1889 hurricane at Apia, Samoa, in which she and a number of other American and foreign naval vessels were lost. He then served on several of the Navy's boards and, in March 1890 became the Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks.

In many ships a shortage of 1-pounders caused them to be replaced by 3-inch (76 mm) guns. Their primary weapon, though, was their torpedo battery of a dozen 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes in four triple mounts. They also carried a pair of depth charge rails. A \\"Y-gun\\" depth charge thrower was added to many ships.Friedman, pp. 44–45 Construction and career Farquhar, named for Norman von Heldreich Farquhar, was launched 18 January 1919 by Union Iron Works, San Francisco; sponsored by Mrs. J. Reed; and commissioned 5 August 1920, Lieutenant Commander R. A. Hall in command. From her home port, San Diego, where she first arrived 26 August 1920, Farquhar operated with the Pacific Fleet in training, maneuvers, and war problems along the west coast from the coast of Washington state to the Panama Canal Zone. In August 1921, she rescued 42 passengers of SS San Jose, stranded off the coast of Mexico. In 1924 and 1927, she joined in fleet concentrations in the Caribbean, and during the second cruise, sailed north to visit New York, Newport, Rhode Island and Norfolk, before returning to San Diego. Farquhar sailed to Hawaii on maneuvers in April 1925, and joined a large force for a cruise to Samoa, Australia, and New Zealand, returning to the west coast in September. April through June 1928 again found her in the Hawaiian Islands for exercises of the complete Battle Fleet. She carried reservists for training in July 1929, and the next month began inactivation at San Diego. Farquhar was decommissioned 20 February 1930, and after temporary service as a barracks ship for submariners, was scrapped in accordance with the London Treaty limiting naval armaments. The scrapped materials were sold 23 April 1932.

The route dates back to Roman times. In the 19th century it had a reputation for vice and crime and was the location of the Ratcliff Highway murders. The name \\"Ratcliffe\\" literally means \\"red cliff\\", referring to the red sandstone cliffs which descended from the plateau on which the road was situated down to the Wapping Marshes to the south. Location The Highway runs west–east from the eastern edge of London's financial district, the City of London, to Limehouse. It runs parallel to and south of Commercial Road, the Docklands Light Railway and Cable Street, and connects East Smithfield and the Limehouse Link tunnel. The road forms an unofficial boundary of Wapping, which lies between the River Thames and The Highway. It is also close to Shadwell Basin to the southeast, Tower Hill to the west, and Whitechapel and Stepney to the north. The Highway is in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, in postal districts E1 and E1W. It lies within the parliamentary constituencies of Bethnal Green and Bow and Poplar and Canning Town. History The Ratcliffe (sometimes Ratcliff) Highway dates from at least Saxon Britain, running east from the City of London, London's historic core, along the top of a plateau near the edge of the eponymous \\"red cliff\\" which descended onto the low-lying tidal marshes of Wapping to the south. Jamrach, the famous dealer in wild animals. According to one source the animals (including lions) were kept in cages in the basement.Frank T. Bullen, \\"With Christ in Sailor Town\\", (Hodder & Stoughton: London), 1901, p.35. In the late 19th century Charles Jamrach, a dealer in wild animals, opened Jamrach's Animal Emporium on The Highway. The store became the largest pet store in the world as seafarers moored at the Port of London sold any exotic animals they had brought with them to Jamrach, who in turn supplied zoos, menageries and private collectors. At the north entrance to the nearby Tobacco Dock stands a bronze sculpture of a boy standing in front of a tiger, commemorating an incident where a fully-grown Bengal tiger escaped from Jamrach's shop into the street and picked up and carried off a small boy, who had approached and tried to pet the animal having never seen such a big cat before. The boy escaped unhurt after Jamrach gave chase and prised open the animal's jaw with his bare hands. The tale was the inspiration for the 2011 novel Jamrach's Menagerie by British author Carol Birch. A Ratcliff Picture (1902). A low prostitute and her bully about to mug a sailor on a drunken spree (centre).From Machray, Robert, The Night Side of London, 1902; illustration by Tom Browne. By 1908 Ratcliff Highway had different names for each of its sections. From west to east these ran: St. George's Street East, High Street (Shadwell), Cock Hill, and Broad Street. The whole of the central area of The Highway was named after St. George in the East church and the parish of St. George in the East. A Roman bath house was excavated in 2004 by the junction of The Highway and Wapping Lane. The discovery of women's jewellery along with soldiers' possessions suggested that this location outside of the Roman walls allowed less restricted use of the baths than those in the City itself. The remains of the baths and under-floor heating system were re-buried under the car-park of a development of new apartments.

There are two lanes in each direction throughout its length. It lies outside of the London congestion charge zone (CCZ). ;Bus There are few bus stops on The Highway, but London Buses routes 100 and D3 pass along short lengths of it.

It was the first budget issued by Finance Minister John Manley who was given the job in May 2002 replacing Paul Martin. It was also the last budget of Prime Minister Jean Chrétien. In the previous fiscal year the Canadian economy had done well, despite the recent recession in the United States. The budget saw another large surplus, which was enhanced by a shift to more stringent accrual accounting announced in the budget. The bill was largely seen as a departure from the fiscal austerity of the last several years. It had a wide range of new spending initiatives on health care, child care, defence, education, and other social programs. The budget had only limited tax cuts, mostly directed at corporations. The budget set forth a plan of gradual reductions that would see corporate taxes fall well below American levels. The most important was the reduction of the Canadian Capital Tax. Employment Insurance premiums were also cut.
