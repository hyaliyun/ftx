Description The solid shell grows to a height of 2 cm and has an ovate- conic shape. Its pointed, conic spire is higher and more acute than the spire of Phasianella nivosa. The five, somewhat convex whorls are separated by well marked sutures and are somewhat flattened above. The rather small aperture is short ovate, and measures less than half the length of the shell. It is widely rounded below, and angular above. The columella has a flattened callus. The parietal wall has a more or less white callus, and is decidedly thickened near the posterior angle. The color of the shell is variable, often pale with reddish-brown and white dashes and blotches. It is usually flesh tinted, ashen or brown, more or less clouded with darker and lighter shades, and flammulated with dark and light below the sutures, spirally traversed by narrow hair-like lines of brown or red, interrupted by white dots and intervals. The white is sometimes predominate. Habitat This species lives among macroalgae in shallow areas.

The Security Council noted proposals from resolutions 661 (1991), 687 (1991) and 715 (1991) for the United Nations Special Commission and Director of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to develop a mechanism to monitor Iraqi imports and exports of weapons in a letter received on 7 December 1995. Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Security Council approved the proposals in the letter subject to the provisions of the current resolution. It was affirmed that the mechanism would not impair the operation of future or existing non-proliferation agreements, and that requests for sales to Iraq made by countries or Iraqi requests to export items should be addressed to the Commission established in Resolution 661. All countries were asked about arms supplies to Iraq and to submit information to the joint unit of the Commission and the IAEA, and to notify the joint unit of any attempts by companies to circumvent the mechanism, and also cases where Iraq has not followed procedure. Within 45 days, Member States were to be provided with the relevant information from the Special Commission and Director General of the IAEA regarding the implementation of the procedures of the mechanism. The Security Council demanded that Iraq meet all its obligations under the mechanism. Commencing on 11 April 1996, the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros- Ghali and the Director General of the IAEA were required to report periodically on progress every six months.

Its origins can be traced back to the 15th century, and in 1513 the carnival led to a peasant revolt. The Bernese carnivals were held more or less regularly in medieval times, with strong anti-Papal rhetoric occurring between 1523 and 1525. After the Peasants' War religious themes in carnivals were prohibited and did not return until the local reformation of 1528 returned freedom of speech and expression to the Protestants.Ehrstine, pp. 83, 84 Authorities also tried to ban carnivals in later centuries. The carnival as it is known today was introduced in 1982, and is unique because it incorporates the city's history by beginning the carnival with the symbolic freeing of the bear. The carnival in Bern in the country's third largest such celebration. Carnival beginnings Carnival was established in Bern during the medieval period. In Bern, the term for carnival is either Fasnacht or Fastnacht which means on the eve of fasting. Before the beginning of Lent, or the 40-day fasting period, feasts and folk-festivals were commonly held. During the 15th, century Bern began to grow in importance, and in the 1420s during a carnival the cornerstone for the new Rathaus was laid. The importance of the city became noticeable as visitors flocked to the city during the carnival celebrations. From the mid- to the end of the 15th century Bern saw visitors to the yearly carnival arrive from surrounding cities and Cantons such as Lucerne and as far away as from Cantons such as Schwyz. Carnival during the Reformation During the 16th century, the Reformation caused a rift between the Protestant and Catholic citizenry of Bern, and according to scholars the city considered keeping to the Catholic Church as late as 1526;Erhstine, p. 89 however, during this period playwrights used the opportunity to present an anti-Catholic message during the carnival (or shrovetide) Lenten celebrations. Some Reformation era carnival plays depicted contrasts between Catholics and Protestants, while others contrasted Jews and gentiles, such as in Goliath by Hans von R√ºte.Ehrstine, pp. 221, 222 Niklaus Manuel was the first writer to present ideas for reform and to belittle the Papacy in his plays.Ehrstine, p. 102 In 1522 he wrote two farces about the Pope, in which he showed the difference between the Pope and his priests, and Jesus. Real life events, in particular the Battle of Novara (1513), created the backdrop for Manuel's writings. He wrote about Cardinal Anselm von Hochmuth (Haughtiness): \\"Mightily I have enjoyed it,/For Christian blood to me is dear,/And that's why a red hat I wear.\\" In another Manuel play the Pope dismisses the plight of a Knight of Rhodes assisting in the war against the Turks, and declares: \\"No bacon to the turnips for that war, it is better to make a war with Christians.\\" Beginning in the mid-1520s there appear to have been incidents of sporadic violence in Bern during carnival which may have shown the tension of the Reformation period. Records show that the carnival was discontinued during the mid-to-latter half of the decade.Ehrstine, p. 118 In the 1530s the carnival continued, but the entertainment had a different emphasis than in the earlier decade. Records show that plays with a serious religious subject were put on as early as the 1530s in Bern, with Hans von R√ºte's Abg√∂tterie (1531) possibly being the first. Hans von R√ºte wrote plays about Biblical themes for the Bern carnival. In Gideon (1540) the Jews are depicted as losing to their enemies for seven devastating years because they adopted idolatry and abandoned God. Gideon eventually defeats all the enemies of the Israelites, a recurring historical theme, but first he has to destroy the altar of Ba'al. Although the story, as told in von R√ºte's play, was taken from the Book of Judges and was about Jews, R√ºte (as before him Manuel) meant to attack the idolatry of Catholic clerics. Von R√ºte's Gideon defeats Zwinglian authority by destroying the Ba'al altar.Ehrstine, p. 168 However, in contrast to the plays of the earlier decade, von R√ºte's plays show a shift away from \\"protestant polemics\\" as he eventually uses the Bernese Bear as an allegorical figure.Ehrstine, p. 84 The tradition of Reformation era carnival theater (Fasnachtspiele) came to an end in the mid-1530s and Bernese record show that the genre came to an end by the late 1530s.Ehrstine, p. 134 The carnival today Having been banned during the 16th century, Bern had no carnival for a long time. Instead, residents traveled to Basel or the Lucerne to enjoy carnival. In the 1970s the idea of bringing carnival back to Bern began to grow, and was first initiated with a children's carnival. In 1982 the era of the modern carnival began. Now, the Bernese Fasnacht is the third largest carnival in Switzerland although the carnivals in Basel and Lucerne have a longer or \\"more extravagant tradition\\". Carnival in Bern runs for three days in February. Freeing the bear The \\"bear\\" at Berner Fasnacht 2015 According to a popular story, in 1917 Lenin, prior to the Revolution, passed by the bears in Bern, fed them carrots, and said: \\"The bears must be released.\\" The carnival begins with a symbolic liberation of the bear (the participants, who are dressed as bears, wait to be liberated in the old town). Of course, the bear must first be captured. The capture takes place at 11:11 on November 11 (11/11) of the previous year. The bear spends exactly 111 days in Prison Tower for its winter sleep, before being awakened by \\"Ych√ºblete\\" (drumming) and released. In the 1980s, the original organizers of the modern carnival decided to use local history and to incorporate the famous bears of Bern into the modern carnival: thus they conceived of the idea of freeing the bears, thereby adding a modern idea based on the traditions of the city.

It was founded in 2004 by three Dallas executives; Jay Martin, Phil Miller and David Micek. Jay Martin is a former Strategy and Supply Chain Consultant who worked for Arthur D.Little, IBM and PepsiCo. Phil Miller is a Dallas-based Financial Executive and former CFO. David Micek has been a CEO of multiple companies, and was also the President of internet leader AltaVista. In 2004, JobSerf was the first company to demonstrate the feasibility of job search outsourcing, and the pioneer in the job search outsourcing industry. JobSerf Website Job Search Outsourcing JobSerf took the work of searching for and applying to jobs on employment websites such as Craigslist or CareerBuilder and outsourced these tasks to offshore resources.Dallas News By doing this, users of the service were able to apply to many more jobs much faster than if they were doing it themselves. This helped them to free up time to go on interviews, keep working their day jobs, or to apply to even more jobs and supplement the service. In general, the types of service that JSO's provide include general information (e.g. book, articles), customized or tailored advice (e.g. coaching, profile specific information) and tools (e.g. products and services which facilitate easier or more effective job searching by the candidate). Companies like JobSerf take ownership and complete the execution of the task of online job searching. For the first stage of a job search, a resume writer is a good comparison. The job seeker passes information (or an initial draft) to the writer, and the writer completes the job seeker's resume (and cover letters) versus providing them with advice or tools. Image:Jobsearcheffortgraph.jpg Image:Jsochart.jpg =Process= Typically, a job seeker would sign-up on JobSerf's website, and then provide JobSerf with information regarding where to reach them, search focus, past experience and job boards. Users must define their objectives in their job search. Objectives include facets such as geographic area, industries, functional expertise, career level and salary requirements. After this is completed, users would create between 1-5 targeted r√©sum√©s and cover letters for each type of position he or she requires. The company used a ‚Äòfill-in‚Äô concept on the cover letters to provide semi-customization when applying to jobs. The company then created a search algorithm of keywords and websites to conduct deep searches for jobs on the internet. The jobs found were then applied to with the provided cover letters and r√©sum√©s via the user's email address. The company had multiple redundancy controls to prevent applying to those companies and websites that a user advises them to avoid. This improved efficiency by not wasting time with companies known not to be of interest, while also providing privacy protection for employed job seekers or customers in the interview process with the companies on this list. Given the human element of the process, customers have the ability to tailor and refine their search daily depending on their status. Image:Jobserfprocessgraph.jpg Email Address Technology JobSerf used an undisclosed technology that enables it to send and receive emails from users' email addresses without gaining access to their personal information. This enabled the company to apply to jobs while having it appear that the jobseeker did it him/herself. When the recipient saw the email, it showed the customer's name. In addition, when they reply, the customer received the email and not JobSerf.

World fascism: a historical encyclopedia, Volume 1. Santa Barbara, California, USA: ABC-CLIO, Inc, 2006. p. 628. Spengler responded to the claim that socialism's rise in Germany had not begun with the Marxist rebellions of 1918 to 1919, but rather in 1914 when Germany waged war, uniting the German nation in a national struggle that he claimed was based on socialistic Prussian characteristics, including creativity, discipline, concern for the greater good, productivity, and self-sacrifice.Eric D. Weitz. Weimar Germany: promise and tragedy. Princeton, New Jersey, USA: Princeton University Press, 2007. Pp. 336-337. Spengler claimed that these socialistic Prussian qualities were present across Germany and stated that the merger of German nationalism with this form of socialism while resisting Marxist and internationalist socialism would be in the interests of Germany.Eric D. Weitz. Weimar Germany: promise and tragedy. Princeton, New Jersey, USA: Princeton University Press, 2007. Pp. 337. Spengler's Prussian socialism was popular amongst the German political right, especially the revolutionary right who had distanced themselves from traditional conservatism.Eric D. Weitz.

His notions of Prussian socialism influenced Nazism and the Conservative Revolutionary movement.Heinrich August Winkler, Alexander Sager. Germany: The Long Road West. English edition. Oxford, England, UK: Oxford University Press, 2006. Pp. 414. Concepts Spengler utilized the anti-English ideas addressed by Johann Plenge and Werner Sombart during World War I that condemned English liberalism and English parliamentarianism while advocating a national socialism that was free from Marxism that would connect the individual to the state through corporative organization.Blamires, Cyprian; Jackson, Paul. World fascism: a historical encyclopedia, Volume 1. Santa Barbara, California, USA: ABC-CLIO, Inc, 2006. p. 628. Prussian character and socialism Spengler claimed that socialistic Prussian characteristics existed across Germany that included creativity, discipline, concern for the greater good, productivity, and self-sacrifice.Eric D. Weitz. Weimar Germany: promise and tragedy. Princeton, New Jersey, USA: Princeton University Press, 2007. Pp. 336-337. Spengler described socialism outside of a class conflict perspective and said \\"The meaning of socialism is that life is controlled not by the opposition between rich and poor, but by the rank that achievement and talent bestow. That is our freedom, freedom from the economic despotism of the individual.\\"Heinrich August Winkler, Alexander Sager. Germany: The Long Road West. English edition. Oxford, England, UK: Oxford University Press, 2006. Pp. 414. Spengler addressed the need of Germans to accept Prussian socialism to free themselves from foreign forms of government: Spengler went further to demonstrate the difference between England's capitalist nature and Prussian socialism by saying: Spengler claimed that Frederick William I of Prussia became the \\"first conscious socialist\\" for having founded Prussian tradition of military and bureaucratic discipline.H. Stuart Hughes. Oswald Spengler. New Brunswick, New Jersey, USA: Transaction Publishers, 1992. Pp. 108. Spengler claimed that Otto von Bismarck pursued Prussian socialism through his implementation of social policy that complemented his conservative policies rather than contradicted them as claimed by others.H. Stuart Hughes. Oswald Spengler. New Brunswick, New Jersey, USA: Transaction Publishers, 1992. Pp. 108. Rebuke of Marxism and definition of \\"true socialism\\" Spengler denounced Marxism for having developed socialism from an English perspective, while not understanding Germans' socialist nature. In the pamphlet, a central argument is that the corrupt forces promoting English socialism in his country comprised an \\"invisible English army, which Napoleon had left behind on German soil after the Battle of Jena.\\"Spengler's Prussian Socialism, pp. 7-8 Spengler accused Marxism of following the British tradition in which the poor envy the rich. He claimed that Marxism sought to train the proletariat to \\"expropriate the expropriator\\", the capitalist, so that the proletariat could live a life of leisure on this expropriation. In summary, Spengler concluded that \\"Marxism is the capitalism of the working class\\" and not true socialism. In contrast to Marxism, Spengler claimed that \\"true socialism\\" in its German form \\"does not mean nationalization through expropriation or robbery.\\" Spengler justified this claim by saying: True socialism according to Spengler would take the form of a corporatism in which \\"local corporate bodies organized according to the importance of each occupation to the people as a whole; higher representation in stages up to a supreme council of the state; mandates revocable at any time; no organized parties, no professional politicians, no periodic elections.\\" Historian Ishay Landa has described the nature of \\"Prussian socialism\\" as decidedly capitalist. For Landa, Spenger strongly opposed labor strikes, trade unions, progressive taxation or any imposition of taxes on the rich, any shortening of the working day, as well as any form of government insurance for sickness, old age, accidents, or unemployment. At the same time as he rejected any social democratic provisions, Spengler celebrated private property, competition, imperialism, capital accumulation, and \\"wealth, collected in few hands and among the ruling classes\\". Landa describes Spengler's \\"Prussian Socialism\\" as \\"working a whole lot, for the absolute minimum, but ‚Äî and this is a vital aspect ‚Äî being happy about it.\\" References External links *Prussianism and Socialism ‚Äì English translation of the full text on the Internet Archive Category:Books about nationalism Category:Books about socialism Category:Conservative Revolutionary movement Category:German nationalism Category:Nazism Category:Books about politics of Germany Category:Syncretic political movements Category:Works by Oswald Spengler Category:1919 non-fiction books ","title":"Preussentum und Sozialismus"},{"id":"27026852","text":"Sadegh or accented SƒÅdegh (in Persian ÿµÿßÿØŸÇ) is an Iranian name and variant of Sadeq.

It is the authority for the statement that the royal prerogative is placed in abeyance (is not used) when statute law can provide a legal basis for an action. Defence of the Realm ‚Äì War ‚Äì Exigencies of the Public Service ‚Äì Crown ‚Äì Royal Prerogative ‚Äì Right of Crown to take Possession of Land and Buildings without Compensation ‚Äì Defence Act, 1842 ‚Äì Defence of the Realm Consolidation Act, 1914 and Regulations thereunder. Facts De Keyser's Royal Hotel Ltd, as owner of a hotel situated in Blackfriars, London, claimed compensation under the Defence Act 1842 for occupation of the hotel by the armed forces during the First World War. The government relied on prerogative power under which 'less compensation would be payable'. De Keyser's Royal Hotel was a 300‚Äì400 bedroom hotel on the Victoria Embankment, founded in the 1860s by Polydore de Keyser, that occupied the former site of Bridewell Palace.De Keyser's Royal Hotel, Victoria Embankment, London, demolished for the erection of Unilever House, 1931 The London Encyclopaedia by Christopher Hibbert, Ben Weinreb, Julia Keay, John Keay, 3rd Revised Edition (2010), p.183. Officers of the Crown had taken possession of the hotel in 1916, purporting to act under statutory powers conferred by the Defence of the Realm Act 1914 (DORA). When challenged by the owner in petition of right proceedings, it was argued for the Crown that the competent military authority was empowered by the 1914 Act and regulations to take possession of land and buildings while the subject had no legal right to compensation. =The prospects for the hotel's business= Before the outbreak of the war with Germany, De Keyser's had been operating as a first class hotel, mainly for a continental clientele. By the time the hotel was taken for the wartime use of the Crown in May 1916, the hotel premises were held on a set of leaseholds expiring in 1961, but due to the loss of clientele in wartime, the hotel had been running at a loss. From June 1915 the company was in the hands of a receiver and manager, Arthur Whinney, appointed by the Chancery Court for the holders of the company's debentures (bearing annual interest of about ¬£6,000). He had proceeded to cut some of the business losses, and before the take-over in 1916 he informed the official negotiating for the Crown that the hotel's business had improved considerably and future prospects were favourable. The company's petition of right was presented in February 1917. Before the attorney-general's fiat was given for letting the petition of right proceed, a senior civil servant informed the Home Office that the hotel company was the only party in connection with requisitioning by the Office of Works to have refused to let the claim be dealt with under the DORA regulations. In the meantime, petition of right proceedings had previously been heard by the Court of Appeal in July 1915,In re A Petition of Right [1915] 3 KB 649 concerning the requisition of Shoreham Aerodrome, an airfield on the south coast, by another department, the War Office, and when the owner's appeal came to be heard by the House of Lords in July 1916, additional relevant historical information was available, resulting in an outcome that enabled the owner (The Brighton-Shoreham Aerodrome Ltd) to obtain compensation under the Defence Act 1842.Gerry R. Rubin, Private Property, Government Requisition and the Constitution, 1914-1927, Bloomsbury, 1994. pages 71‚Äì86 and 55ff. Judgment In 1919, the Court of Appeal (Sir Charles Swinfen Eady MR and Warrington LJ; Duke LJ dissenting),[1919] 2 Ch. 197 reversing the decision of Mr Justice Peterson in the High Court, decided that De Keyser's Royal Hotel Ltd, as the hotel's owner, was entitled to compensation in the manner provided by the Defence Act 1842.Defence Act 1842 On the Attorney-General's appeal in 1920, the House of Lords unanimously affirmed the Court of Appeal's decision, rejecting the government's claim to rely on prerogative power, and holding that once the statute had been enacted the prerogative powers fell into abeyance, for the duration of the life of its provisions should the statute be replaced or amended or modified.Official Law Report, Appeal Cases series Present at the House of Lords hearing were four Lords of Appeal in Ordinary: Lord Dunedin, Lord Atkinson, Lord Moulton, and Lord Sumner, plus Lord Parmoor (not a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary, but a member of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council which had ruled on the case of The Zamora (1916)Privy Council, The Zamora, On Appeal from the High Court, Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty Division.

At the hearing, the Crown was represented by Sir Gordon Hewart, Attorney-General, and Sir Ernest Pollock, Solicitor- General, and the other party was represented by Sir John Simon KC and Leslie Scott KC. In an introduction to an authoritative commentary published soon after the decision, Simon described it as one of the leading cases in constitutional law, concerned with establishing the rights of individual citizens in the face of exceptional interference by the Executive.The case of requisition: in re a petition of right of De Keyser's Royal Hotel Limited, Scott and Hildesley, Clarendon Press (1920) The principles established in the De Keyser's Royal Hotel case have been referred to in later judgments when the government's claim to rely on the exercise of power under the royal prerogative has been challenged, such as Laker Airways Ltd v Department of Trade (1976), concerning the revocation of the commercial airline operator's licence of Laker Airways,Laker Airways Ltd v Department of Trade [1977] QB 643, [1976] EWCA Civ 10 R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Fire Brigades Union (1995), concerning changes to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme,R v Home Secretary, ex parte Fire Brigades Union [1995] UKHL 3 (05 April 1995) [1995] 2 AC 513 and most recently in R (Miller) v The Prime Minister and Cherry v Advocate General for Scotland (2019), concerning the Royal Prerogative to prorogue Parliament.

Lauderdale's skyline,Emporis.com 110 Tower 110 Tower entry on Emporis.com and also the tallest office building. 110 Tower is located adjacent to the Broward County Courthouse and the Broward county jail in Fort Lauderdale's Justice District along 6th Street. It is across the street from the new 27 story Broward County Courthouse Building that will begin construction in October 2011. In October 2005, Hurricane Wilma struck South Florida and damaged the building's facade, including several windows. The most notable damage was the removal of the blue neon lighting that lined the top of the building which was blown off by high winds. The lighting was replaced in 2010 with LED lights that allow the building lines to be highlighted with multiple colors. In September 2010, the building's master tenant, AutoNation, moved out of the building when its lease expired, leaving the building half empty. With the building half empty the owners, Genesis Capital Partners XI, Ltd., took the opportunity to substantially renovate the building. In October 2010, 110 Tower began undergoing the substantial $31 million renovation of the building's heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems as well as the renovation of the common areas and exterior. Most floors were gutted to the slab, enabling the owners to replace obsolete electrical systems, HVAC, and water systems with modern, sustainable technologies. These improvements enabled the building to earn the Energy Star Rating in September 2011, as well as being awarded the LEED EB Gold designation by the U.S. Green Building Council that year. Also in 2011, 110 Tower was named LEED E.B.

It is located at the intersection of Wisconsin Highway 96 and County T. As of the 2010 census, its population was 528.  History  Settlers who would plat the land comprising the community of Dale arrived between 1851 and 1853, and approximately twenty families arrived between the fall of 1853 and June 1854, establishing a solid population. Dale was founded and platted along the proposed Manitowoc and Mississippi Railroad line, which consolidated with the Wisconsin Central Railroad in 1871. Rail construction on the right of way by the Wisconsin Central reached Dale in 1872. Early in its history, the community was called Poker Flat in addition to Dale, for what a 1923 newspaper article terms \\"an unknown reason\\". = 20th century = Dale was on the original path of the transcontinental Yellowstone Trail auto trail, established in 1915. This highway through Dale was first given the numerical designation State Trunk Highway 18 in 1917, which in turn was changed to U.S Route 10 in 1926. Dale had a three-room school run by the New London school district, which housed K-3 education through the late 1960s. The school was closed by fall 1969. Students who did go to Dale School were bussed to nearby Readfield School after the closure, and the property was sold to the Zion United Church of Christ in November 1969. On September 3, 1974, one of three contractors installing curb and gutter pulled a gas line apart under Dale's Appleton State Bank, while digging a storm sewer trench with a backhoe. Natural gas leaked into the basement of the bank, and caused an explosion at 12:50 pm. An assistant bank manager who was preparing to re-open the bank for business hours was flung from the building by the force of the blast, and died of head and chest injuries five hours after the blast. Another person in a nearby building suffered two broken legs and a shoulder injury. The explosion destroyed the bank building and Dale's post office, situated next door to the bank. Postal service was temporarily run out of Dale's town hall, and Appleton State Bank business out of a trailer, until both could have new buildings constructed. = 21st century = On December 5, 2003, the primary route through Dale changed designation from U.S. Route 10 to Wisconsin Highway 96, when new divided highway for US 10 between Greenville and Fremont was completed.

It aired on April 19, 2010. Plot Ted is stunned when his mother and her long-term boyfriend Clint announce they are going to be married. At the reception, Ted is unable to grasp the fact that his mother is getting married a second time before he has even once, and when Clint begins singing a song, Ted flees without giving his toast. Three days later, Ted reveals that he has bid for and bought a house. The gang questions his decision, as the house is old and dilapidated, but Ted is convinced that as an architect he can fix up the house once he starts a family. The group berates Ted for making this decision too early, seeing as he is not even married yet. Marshall tries to take the pressure off his friend by having the group play a game where they try and guess whether Marshall had been a kid or drunk during wild and stupid instances in his life (such as putting fireworks in the microwave). When an inspector arrives and begins rambling off the number of problems with the house, Ted finally agrees with the group, especially after the inspector is injured when he falls through the ceiling. Dejected, Ted wonders if he will ever have the life he dreams of; Lily cheers him up by telling him to bash at the house with a sledgehammer, and the whole group has fun smashing a wall with it. Ted goes to see his mother and Clint, and gives them the toast he had meant to give earlier. Later, Ted returns to the house, and finds Marshall cooking sausages on a grill in the back, having been invited by Robin. Marshall knows Ted is not going to give up on the house, and Ted thanks him for sticking up for him and tells him his plans for it. Future Ted tells his kids that time can turn what seem to be stupid decisions into something else and that he did achieve his dreams for the house... for it is the same house in which Ted is telling his kids the story of how he met their mother. Meanwhile, Barney catches Robin crying during Clint's song at the wedding, and takes every opportunity to mock her for it. Robin finally snaps and reveals it was in fact Barney who was crying, and that he offered to pay Robin to keep quiet and say she had been the one shedding tears. Barney explains he was jealous of Clint, revealing he had once kissed Ted's mother while dropping her off at the airport after their brunch in 2006. Critical response Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+. She said the episode exposed a different angle on Ted's love story by showing where his future family would live. She noted the execution of Marshall's Drunk or Kid game and Barney's exaggerated recollections were a bit off. Cindy McClellan of Television Without Pity also gave the episode a B+ score, citing the implausibility of having a real-estate inspector study the house when Ted's architecture skills can determine the flaws as well.

The film argues that the likelihood of the use of nuclear weapons has increased since the end of the Cold War due to terrorism, nuclear proliferation, theft of nuclear materials and weapons, and other factors. The documentary film was set for a July 9, 2010 theatrical release in the United States but was changed to July 23. Production The film features interviews with leading statesmen and experts, including Tony Blair, Jimmy Carter, Mikhail Gorbachev, Robert McNamara, Pervez Musharraf, and Valerie Plame. The film prologue was narrated by Gary Oldman. The musical score was composed by Peter Golub, and the rock band Pearl Jam contributed the song \\"The Fixer.\\" It was developed, financed and executive produced by Participant Media together with the World Security Institute.http://www.takepart.com/zero/ The idea for the film first occurred to the producers when the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Al Gore after the success of his documentary about global warming, An Inconvenient Truth. Diane Weyermann of Participant Media asked Walker if she was interested in directing a film about nuclear weapons, and Walker said yes. More than 84 people were interviewed for the film. Global Zero, an international organization promoting the elimination of nuclear weapons, provided production assistance for the film. The film's closing credits contain a phone number to which a text message may be sent to protest the maintenance of high levels of nuclear arsenals and lax security regarding nuclear weapons and materials.DeFore, John. \\"Docu Paints Convincing Nuclear Doomsday Scenario.\\" Reuters. February 2, 1010. The film debuted at the Sundance Film Festival in 2010, where it screened at the Palais des Festivals out of competition.

Tad Daley, writer of the book Apocalypse Never was invited to speak at the film's debut in Washington, DC about the dangers of nuclear weapons. In an interview he said that it was a coincidence that the book and the movie came out virtually exactly at the same time and that Countdown To Zero and Apocalypse Never had the same ambition and that ambition is twofold: 1) to talk to ordinary folks about the nuclear peril and 2) that abolition should be the solution.. A video promoting the movie was created with the assistance of Ploughshares, an award-winning literary magazine at Emerson College. The premiere screening took place at the E Street Cinema in Washington, DC and the shows have been sold out. These screenings brought in large crowds.Videos: Countdown To Zero Premiere Screening in Washington, DC . Edward Vinatea. Critical reception A review in Daily Variety called the film \\"highly creative documentary-making\\" and concluded that the film makes \\"a convincing argument that the human race is on borrowed time: Given the number of nuclear weapons in existence, the ease with which they can be made, the eagerness of terrorists to possess them and a worldwide cluelessness about nuclear security, it's only a matter of time before something terribly ugly happens. A politically urgent picture, it will also literally scare the breath out of what will certainly be a worldwide audience.\\" The trade journal also highly praised the special effects and cinematography for creating \\"immaculate images\\".

The work can be made of any material that is suitable for being cut in this way, such as wood, bone, ivory or metal. Plain turning is work executed on a lathe where a transverse section through any part of the work comprises a plain circle. Ornamental turning, also called Complex turning, is executed on a lathe with attachments which convert that plain circular section to variants of outline; these range from a simple series of cuts taken at intervals around the work (so producing grooves or bumps on the surface) to non-circular movements whereby the whole of the circular shape is removed to give a completely different form. Such shapes are achieved by various means, the principal ones being: * Cutting with a fixed or revolving cutter while the work is rotated on a non-radial path, e.g.- eccentrically, elliptically, epicyclically or, following a path determined by a template or reciprocating device * Cutting with a revolving cutter while the work remains static, then partially rotating the work and holding it in each new position (using an indexing device) so as to produce a series of cuts at intervals around the cylinder or surface * Cutting with a fixed or revolving cutter while the work is rotated on a radial or non-radial path and the cutting apparatus follows a linear, circular or non-circular motion, the two motions being synchronised by gearing. History Ornamental turning is believed to have originated in Bavaria in the latter part of the 15th century when it consisted mostly of rose-work, being done by using a cam or template (called a rosette) mounted on the lathe spindle and allowing the headstock to rock under tension of a spring or weight, to follow the contour on the edge of the rosette: also the spindle was allowed to slide to and fro endwise under tension of another spring, or weight, to follow the contour on the face of the rosette. Thus, as the work was rotated it rocked and traversed so that the cutting tool produced wavy lines upon the surface or the cylinder. Before the end of the 18th century, cutting tools were generally hand-held or clamped to a fixed 'rest'. The slide rest, which allows the cutter to slide along the rest under control of a leadscrew, although invented before 1480, was not in general use until much later. It is clear from surviving examples of their work that the skill of the early turners was highly developed. In response to growing interest by wealthy and great patrons, including several of the royal families of Europe, two great works on the art and science of turning were published in France:.‚ÄúL‚ÄôArt du Tourneur‚Äù by Plumier, 1701, and ‚ÄúManual de Tourner‚Äù by Bergeron, 1792 Meanwhile, turning technology was being developed in England where the practice of arresting the work from point to point (by a division plate) and applying a revolving cutter (held in an improved slide rest) was employed. By the beginning of the 19th century John Jacob Holtzapffel had established his workshop in London and built a reputation as a maker of high-class lathes and tools. Many of his customers were among the monarchs and nobility of Europe and England became the world centre for the pastime of ornamental turning. The Holtzapffel firm continued to make lathes until 1927 by which time they had produced a total of 2557, serially numbered, many of which were equipped for ornamental turning. Other engineers copied or varied his designs but none were so prolific in their manufacture. The hobby of ornamental turning declined rapidly following the invention of the motor- car which, by the end of the First World War, had become the fashionable pastime of the mechanically minded amateur, and the lathes with their complex equipment were abandoned. Relatively few of these mechanical marvels survive today and hardly any are complete with all their original accessories. However, the hobby is still kept alive by a small band of enthusiasts, notably the Society of Ornamental Turners, founded in 1948 and based in England but with members world-wide; new groups have since been established, principally in the United States, Australia and New Zealand. The members of all these societies seek to develop the knowledge of ornamental turning and to restore, maintain and use the old equipment or, to adapt modern lathes for ornamental turning. Some are even bringing the hobby right up-to-date by building computer-controlled O.T. lathes. Holtzapffel and other books The accepted definitive published work on ornamental turning is the book Turning and Mechanical Manipulation, by Charles and John Jacob Holtzapffel.Turning and Mechanical Manipulation by Charles & John Jacob Holtzapffel (5 vols. 1843-1897) Volume 5, entitled ‚ÄúThe Principles and Practice of Ornamental or Complex Turning‚Äù is considered to be the bible of ornamental turning but there is much related information in the other volumes. Other useful books include: Ornamental Turning, by J.H.Evans,Ornamental Turning by J.H.Evans, 1903-4 The Lathe & Its Uses, by J LukinThe Lathe & Its Uses by J Lukin, Ornamental Turning, by T D Walshaw,Ornamental Turning, by T D Walshaw, and Holtzapffel Volume VI by John F.Edwards, 2013.Holtzapffel Volume VI by John F.Edwards, 2013 Reprints of all these books are usually obtainable. The Society of Ornamental Turners was founded in 1948 with the object to encourage, develop and promote the study and practice of the art and science of ornamental turning. Its members meet quarterly in London to display examples of their work, share their experiences and attend a lecture or demonstration. Seminars and outings to places of interest are also arranged. A bulletin containing articles on all aspects of ornamental turning and news of the society is published half-yearly in March and September and a newsletter in July and December. The society maintains a website: which contains much information about this pastime together with a gallery of pictures of ornamentally turned objects. Competitions are held annually for ornamental turning, plain turning, making equipment, displays at meetings, contributions to the bulletin and for advancing the knowledge of the art. Over many years a close association has been formed between the Society and the Worshipful Company of Turners of London and several members of the Society are Freemen or Liverymen of the Worshipful Company. From time to time the Worshipful Company holds competitions which include categories open specifically to members of the Society.Definition & History, by John F Edwards, Past President & Roger Davies, former Editor, of the Society of Ornamental Turners 1992, revised by J.F.E. 2010 'History of the Lathe by Robert S.

A native of Dzivarasekwa, he attended Ellis Robins School where he took a special interest in art history. Gengezha credits his father, Temba Gengezha, as his greatest inspiration when creating beautiful works. From 1975 until his untimely death in 2001, Temba Gengezha's sculptures were popular and celebrated both locally and abroad for their style and artistry. As a child, Gengezha played with stones on the floor of his father's workshops but it was not until 1998, at the age of 17, that he began sculpting and hone his artistic vision under the tutelage of his father. Gengezha's inherent creativity is evident in the skill, originality and attention to detail which is characteristic of his work. He credits Chituwa Jemali and Dominic Benhura as largely influential in his decision to maintain a unique and distinctive style of Shona art. Gengezha has collaborated with many noted Zimbabwean sculptors through his connection to Chapungu Sculpture Park. Bronson Gengezha is most often inspired by nature, everyday life in Zimbabwe, and the bonds of family. Gengezha's pieces can be found in galleries and private collections throughout Germany, Canada, Australia, Holland, Japan, South Africa, and the United States. He continues to be recognized for his work with Kwekwe serpentine and lepidolite.

Although similar in appearance to a common limpet, it has a hole near the apex of its shell, and is only distantly related. It often has a scaled polychaete worm Arctonoe vittata living inside its shell as a commensal. In the event that it is attacked by a starfish, it extends flaps of mantle to defend itself, and the worm also helps drive the predator away. Description D. aspera has a cone-shaped shell growing to a length of about . Near the apex is an aperture about one tenth of the length of the shell, which is used for respiration and the elimination of waste. There is a broad foot which exerts suction on the rock surface, and the mantle is large enough to cover the margin of the shell. The surface of the shell is sculptured with coarse ribs and is usually greyish-brown or grey, often with dark and pale radiating bands of colour. The margin of the shell is crenulate and the interior is white. Distribution This species is native to the northeastern Pacific Ocean from Alaska to Mexico. It occurs in the lower part of the intertidal zone and the shallow sub-littoral, down to about . It typically clings to the lower part and underside of rocks, but is sometimes found on the holdfasts and stalks of kelp. When the tide is out and it is exposed, it tends to always attach itself to the same spot, where its shell neatly fits the contours of the rock. Ecology Diodora aspera, underside When the tide comes in, this keyhole limpet crawls around, scraping bryozoans and algae off the rock surface with its radula. Certain species of sponges are also consumed. The sexes are separate and individuals with ripe gonads occur throughout the year. The eggs and sperm are shed into the sea where fertilisation takes place, and the larvae settle on the sea bed. This keyhole limpet is host to the ectoparasitic copepod Anthessius nortoni. The scaled polychaete worm Arctonoe vittata acts as a commensal to D. aspera, living between the foot and the shell. This worm is relatively large, growing to a length of up to , and may need to bend in order to fit. The worm is a predator, but does not attack its host, instead searching for prey to target as the limpet moves around. It is however willing to defend its host if a predacious starfish approaches, by biting at its tube feet. The keyhole limpet is also able to defend itself against attacks by starfish. On the approach of certain species of starfish, it swiftly extends and folds its mantle upwards to cover the shell, while another flap of mantle descends to cover the foot. At the same time, the inhalent syphon is extended through the aperture and covers the apex of the shell. As a result of these defensive actions, the starfish is unable to get a grip on the limpet shell with its tube feet; it is also possible that there is some chemical deterrent present in the mantle. At any rate, the starfish desists, and the limpet lowers its mantle after about twenty minutes. Not all starfish elicit this response, which is likely to be mediated by some chemical cue.

Volk joined the Celtics in 1971 after graduating from Columbia Law School. His early work with the team included ticket sales director, manager of equipment purchases, traveling secretary, business manager, and general counsel. In 1976 he was promoted to vice president and in 1980 was named Assistant General Manager. When Red Auerbach announced that he would retire as Celtics general manager following the 1984 NBA Draft, he designated Volk as his preference as his successor. On July 11, 1984 Volk was officially named General Manager of the Boston Celtics. Volk's first move as Celtics General Manager came on October 16, 1984 when he traded Gerald Henderson to the Seattle SuperSonics for a 1st round pick in the 1986 NBA Draft. In his first season as GM, the Celtics had a 63‚Äì19 record and returned to the NBA Finals, losing to the Los Angeles Lakers in six games.https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/BOS/1985_transactions.html For the 1985-86 season, Volk drafted Sam Vincent and traded for Bill Walton and Jerry Sichting.https://www.basketball- reference.com/teams/BOS/1985_transactions.htmlhttps://www.basketball- reference.com/teams/BOS/1986_transactions.html In his second season as GM, the Celtics won the NBA Championship, defeating the Houston Rockets 4‚Äì2.https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/BOS/1986_transactions.html Using the draft pick he obtained as compensation for Gerald Henderson, Volk selected Len Bias with the second overall pick in the 1986 NBA Draft. On June 20, 1986, three days after the draft, Bias died of a cardiac arrhythmia related to usage of cocaine.http://proxy.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?id=1216291 Despite the death of their top draft pick, the Celtics finished the 1986-87 season with a 59‚Äì23 and appeared in their fourth consecutive NBA Finals, losing to the Lakers 4‚Äì2.https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/BOS/1987_transactions.html The Celtics made the playoffs during each of Volk's next six seasons as GM, but did not return to the NBA Finals.https://www.basketball- reference.com/teams/BOS/ After a 32-50 1993-94 season, many of Volk's responsibilities, including the drafting and signing of players, were reassigned to Director of Basketball Operations M. L. Carr. He resigned from the team on May 6, 1997, which allowed incoming team president and head coach Rick Pitino to hire his own General Manager.

It was subsequently released by Acclaim Entertainment for nearly every home platform of the time. The game focuses on several characters of various intentions who enter a martial arts tournament with worldly consequences. It introduced many key aspects of the Mortal Kombat series, including the unique five-button control scheme and gory finishing moves called Fatalities. Mortal Kombat was considered as one of the greatest video games of all time by critics and audiences in 21st century and became a best-selling game and remains one of the most popular fighting games in the genre's history, spawning numerous sequels and spin-offs over the following years and decades, beginning with Mortal Kombat II in 1993, and together with the first sequel was the subject of a successful film adaptation in 1995. However, it also sparked much controversy for its depiction of extreme violence and gore using realistic digitized graphics, and, along with the home release of Night Trap, prompted the formation of the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), a U.S. government-backed organization that set descriptor ratings for video games. Gameplay Screenshot of a fight between Johnny Cage and Raiden Mortal Kombat is a fighting game in which players battle opponents in one-on-one matches. The fighter that completely drains the opponent's health bar first wins the round, and the first to win two rounds wins the match. Each round is timed; if both fighters still have health remaining when time runs out, the one with more health wins the round. Two players can start a game together, or a second player can join in during a single player's game to fight against him/her. If a game was in progress at the time, the winner continues it alone; if not, the winner begins a new game. Mortal Kombat uses an eight-directional joystick and five buttons, including two punch and two kick buttons (each further divided between high and low). Attacks can vary depending on the player's distance from the opponent. All player characters have a shared set of attacks performed by holding the joystick in various directions, such as a leg sweep and an uppercut; the latter attack knocks the enemy high into the air and causes a large amount of damage. Most special moves were performed by tapping the joystick, sometimes ending with a button press. Unlike previous one-on-one fighting games, few moves require circular joystick movement. The game's blocking system also distinguished itself from other fighting games, as characters take a small amount of damage from regular moves while blocking. However, the dedicated block button allows users to defend against attacks without retreating and blocking characters lose very little ground when struck, thus making counterattacks much easier after a successful block. Mortal Kombat further introduced the concept of \\"juggling\\", knocking an opponent into the air and following up with a combination of attacks while the enemy is still airborne and defenseless. The idea became so popular that it has spread to many other games. Another of the game's innovations was the Fatality, a finishing move executed against a defeated opponent to kill them in a gruesome fashion. In the single-player game, the player faces each of the seven playable characters in a series of one-on-one matches against computer- controlled opponents, ending in a \\"Mirror Match\\" against a duplicate of the player's chosen character. The player must then fight in three endurance matches, each of which involves two opponents. As soon as the player defeats the first opponent, the second one enters the arena and the timer resets; however, the player's health meter does not regenerate. After the third endurance match, the player fights the sub-boss Goro, followed by a final match against Shang Tsung. Between certain levels, players can compete in a minigame called \\"Test Your Might\\" for bonus points, breaking blocks of various materials by filling a meter past a certain point through rapid button presses. The first material the player must break is wood, followed by stone, steel, ruby, and finally diamond, with each successive material requiring more of the meter to be filled up and thus awarding more points. Two players can compete in the minigame at once and the last two materials are only accessible through two-player mode. The minigame would return in various forms in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance, Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, and Mortal Kombat: Komplete Edition. Plot The game takes place in Earthrealm, where a tournament is being held on Shang Tsung's Island, on which seven of its locations serve as stages in the game. The introduction to Mortal Kombat explains that Shang Tsung was banished to Earthrealm 500 years previously and, with the help of the monstrous Goro, is able to seize control of the Mortal Kombat tournament in an attempt to doom the realm. For 500 years straight, Goro has been undefeated in the tournament, and now a new generation of warriors must challenge him. The player receives information about the characters in biographies displayed during the attract mode. The bulk of the game's backstory and lore was only told in a comic book, but some additional information about the characters and their motivations for entering the tournament is received upon completion of the game with each character. The storyline of the first Mortal Kombat was later adapted into Paul W. S. Anderson's film Mortal Kombat, including an animated prequel titled Mortal Kombat: The Journey Begins, released direct-to-video. Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero was made as a prequel to the first game, focusing mostly on Bi-Han, the eponymous character. An alternate climax of the first game would be featured on the action-adventure game Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, which tells an alternate version of the events between the first and second Mortal Kombat tournaments. Characters Kano and Sub-Zero Mortal Kombat includes seven playable characters, each with their own Fatality and all of whom would eventually become trademark characters and appear in sequels. The game was developed with digitized sprites based on real actors. The protagonist of the game is the Shaolin monk and Earthrealm's chosen champion Liu Kang, played by Ho-Sung Pak, who enters the tournament to defeat the evil sorcerer Shang Tsung. Elizabeth Malecki plays the Special Forces agent, Sonya Blade, who is pursuing a mercenary from the Black Dragon organization, Kano, played by Richard Divizio. Carlos Pesina plays Raiden (spelled \\"Rayden\\" in the MS-DOS and console ports), the god of thunder and protector of Earthrealm, while his brother Daniel Pesina plays the Hollywood movie star Johnny Cage and the Lin Kuei ninja clan assassin Bi-Han, alias Sub-Zero, as well as the game's two other ninja characters. The blue color of Sub-Zero's outfit was changed to yellow to create the vengeful specter Scorpion, a former ninja from a rival clan who along with his family has been killed by Sub-Zero prior to the tournament, and to green for the game's secret character, Reptile (though the costume used for motion capture was actually red). Mortal Kombat would become famous for such palette swaps that would continue to be used in later games as the technique to create new characters. The four-armed Shokan warrior, Goro serves as the sub-boss of the game; being a half-human, half-dragon beast, he is much stronger than the other characters and cannot be affected by throw attacks. The character's sprites are based on a stop motion model which was created by Curt Chiarelli. Shang Tsung, the game's main antagonist and final boss (also played by Ho-Sung Pak) is a sorcerer who can transform into any playable character in the game at any time during a battle. When fighting on the Pit stage, the player could qualify to fight the secret character Reptile, who uses the moves of both Scorpion and Sub-Zero, by meeting a special set of conditions. Goro, Shang Tsung, and Reptile were non-playable characters. The Masked Guard in the Courtyard stage was portrayed by Mortal Kombat developer John Vogel. Development Mortal Kombat creators Ed Boon and John Tobias have stated that Midway Games tasked them with the project of developing a \\"combat game for release within a year\\", which the two believed was intended to compete with the popular Street Fighter II: The World Warrior. According to Tobias, he and Boon had envisioned a fighting game similar to Karate Champ but featuring large digitized characters even before that, and the success of Street Fighter II only helped them convince the management of their idea. Boon said the development team initially consisted of four people ‚Äî himself as programmer, artists John Tobias and John Vogel, and Dan Forden as sound designer. According to Richard Divizio and Daniel Pesina, Mortal Kombat had actually begun when Tobias along with Divizio and the brothers Daniel and Carlos Pesina planned to create a ninja-themed fighting game, however this idea was rejected by Midway's entire management. Instead, Midway sought to make an action game based on the upcoming movie Universal Soldier and featuring a digitized version of martial arts film star Jean-Claude Van Damme, but he was already in negotiations with another company for a video game that ultimately was never released. Divizio then convinced Tobias to return to their original project. In the end, Van Damme was parodied in the game in the form of Johnny Cage (with whom he shares his name's initials, JC), a narcissistic Hollywood movie star who performs a split punch to the groin in a nod to a scene from Bloodsport. Tobias credited other inspirations as having come from the Asian martial arts cinema. Boon later said, \\"since the beginning, one of the things that's separated us from other fighting games is the crazy moves we've put in it, like fireballs and all the magic moves, so to speak.\\" According to Tobias, the game's ultraviolent content had not been originally intended and was only implemented gradually as the development progressed. The concept of Fatalities in particular evolved from the \\"dizzied\\" mechanic in earlier fighting games. Boon said that he hated the \\"dizzied\\" mechanic, but that it was fun to have one's opponent get dizzied and get in a free hit. Boon and Tobias decided they could eliminate the aggravation of getting dizzied by having it occur at the end of the fight, after the outcome had already been decided. An early version of the game used two more buttons for middle punch and kick attacks. Mortal Kombat was reportedly developed in 10 months from 1991 to 1992, with a test version seeing limited release halfway through the development cycle. As a demo version of the game, which featured only six characters (all male), became internally popular within Midway offices, the team was given more time to work on it, resulting in the addition of Sonya to the roster. Footage for the game's digitized characters was filmed with Tobias' personal Hi-8 camera. The final arcade game used eight megabytes of graphics data, with each character having 64 colors and around 300 frames of animation.Interview with Gary Liddon, Mega, issue 10, page 36, Future Publishing, July 1993 The team had difficulty settling on a name for the game. Ed Boon has stated that for six months during development \\"nobody could come up with a name nobody didn't hate.\\" Some of the names suggested were Kumite, Dragon Attack, Death Blow and Fatality. One day, someone had written down \\"combat\\" on the drawing board for the names in Boon's office and someone wrote a K over the C, according to Boon, \\"just to be kind of weird.\\" Pinball designer Steve Ritchie was sitting in Boon's office, saw the word \\"Kombat\\" and said to him, \\"Why don't you name it Mortal Kombat?\\", a name that Boon stated \\"just stuck.\\" John Tobias recalled this a bit differently, saying it \\"came about during the trademark process in naming the game. We really liked Mortal Combat as a name, but it couldn‚Äôt get past legal.\\" Since then, the series has begun frequently using the letter K in place of the letter C when it has the hard C sound. Release Mortal Kombat and Mortal Kombat II arcade cabinets at PAX South 2015 Although the arcade version of Mortal Kombat was never localized in Japan, it still had an official release there in 1992 by Taito who published North American imports of Midway's game. This is the sole Mortal Kombat game with an involvement from Taito. The launch of Mortal Kombat for home consoles by Acclaim Entertainment was one of the largest video game launches of the time. A flood of TV commercials heralded the simultaneous release of all four home versions of the game, SNES, Genesis, Game Boy and Game Gear, on September 13, 1993, a date dubbed \\"Mortal Monday\\". In the same year, an official comic book, Mortal Kombat Collector's Edition, was written and illustrated by the game's designer artist John Tobias and made available through mail order, describing the backstory of the game in greater detail. The comic was advertised during the game's attract mode and would later be sold normally around the country, although it was quite difficult to get a copy outside of the United States. The comic was also later included as a series of unlockable bonuses in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance. Mortal Kombat: The Album, an album by The Immortals featuring techno music, was released in May 1994. It features two themes for the game, \\"Techno Syndrome\\" and \\"Hypnotic House\\", as well as themes written for each character. \\"Techno Syndrome\\" was adapted for the 1995 movie soundtrack and incorporated the familiar \\"Mortal Kombat!\\" yell from the Mortal Monday commercials. Jeff Rovin also penned a novelization of the first Mortal Kombat game, which was published in June 1995 in order to coincide with the release of the first movie. There were also lines of action figures based on the game's characters. =Home versions= Sub-Zero's Fatality move in the SNES (top) and Genesis (bottom, with blood cheat applied) ports of Mortal Kombat, showcasing the difference in violence levels Four official ports were released in North America as part of the \\"Mortal Monday\\" campaign in 1993. The Super NES (SNES) and Sega Genesis versions were the home console ports, while handheld console ports were released for the Game Boy and Game Gear. While the SNES version's visuals and audio were more accurate than those of the Genesis version, it features changes to the gameplay and due to Nintendo's \\"Family Friendly\\" policy, replaces the blood with sweat and most of the Fatalities with less violent \\"finishing moves\\". The sweat effect, which was a palette coloration added after Nintendo's decision to censor the game, could be reverted to the original red blood color via a Game Genie code input as \\"BDB4-DD07.\\" On the Genesis version, the blood and uncensored Fatalities were available via a cheat code, spelled out \\"ABACABB\\", a nod to the Abacab album by the band Genesis who shared their name with the North American version of the console. This version was given an MA-13 rating by the Videogame Rating Council. The Game Boy version was largely cut down from its arcade counterpart. It had laggy controls and a limited button layout. It also omitted Reptile and the bloodier Fatality moves. However, players could play as Goro via a code. Johnny Cage was apparently intended to be a playable character, but was cut out; bits of his character data remain in the data files. The Game Gear version was similar to the Game Boy version, but with major improvements (color, faster gameplay, and tighter controls). Like its 16-bit counterpart, the game was censored unless a cheat code (2, 1, 2, Down, Up) had been entered, but lacked Kano and Reptile. A Master System port based on the Game Gear version was released for PAL regions in early 1994. According to Phylene Riggs of Acclaim, an NES port was also planned at one point, but cancelled before it entered the programming stage. Ports for the MS-DOS and the Amiga were released in 1994. The MS-DOS version is the most accurate port of the arcade version in terms of graphics and gameplay. It came in both floppy disk and CD-ROM format, with the CD-ROM version having the original arcade music and sound effects. The Amiga version was only released in Europe, with controls limited to either one or two action buttons, and it contained a minimal soundtrack with music arranged by Allister Brimble. The Sega CD version of the game was released featuring a video intro of the Mortal Monday commercial. This port did not require a code to be entered to access the uncensored content and thus was given an MA-17 rating. While this port was technologically inferior to the better-looking SNES port and had loading times, it resembled the arcade version more faithfully in actual gameplay. It also featured the authentic CD-DA soundtrack, taken directly from the arcade version, but some of the arenas feature the wrong music (such as Courtyard playing the Pit's theme). Several remixes of the Mortal Kombat theme music were included as bonus features, including the remix used later for the film adaptation. The gore could be disabled by entering a code at the main menu. Some copies of this version are incompatible with model 1.1 of the Sega CD; Acclaim offered to replace any such discs that were mailed to their Oyster Bay headquarters with working copies. Mortal Kombat was later released in Japan for the Game Gear, Super Famicom, Game Boy and Mega Drive as and for the Mega-CD as with no major changes from their first release. A conversion of the game was being developed by Iguana Entertainment and scheduled to be published on the Atari Jaguar, but it was never released. With the release of Mortal Kombat: Deception \\"Premium Pack\\" in 2004, both the PlayStation 2 and Xbox received ports of the game as bonus content. While it was promoted as \\"arcade perfect\\", there were some issues with the sound and gameplay. That year, Jakks Pacific release the game as one of its Plug It in & Play TV Games. This version of the game is similar to the SNES version but with different music and the original arcade voices. This port lacks flashing text and a scrolling background layer, so moving objects (such as the clouds on The Pit and Palace Gates stages and the monks in the Courtyard) instead remain static. The programmer of this port was Chris Burke, for developer Digital Eclipse.\\"Mortal Kombat for Jakks TV Games\\" . Retrieved 2010-08-26. The game was a part of the 2005 compilation Midway Arcade Treasures: Extended Play. This port features the same controls, graphics and gore that the original game contained, but like Mortal Kombat: Deception \\"Premium Pack\\", it has sound issues and has no bios of the characters. On August 31, 2011, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment released Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection, consisting of Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat II and Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, as a downloadable title for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Reception In November 1993, Acclaim announced that they had shipped more than three million copies of Mortal Kombat, counting the SNES, Genesis, Game Boy, and Game Gear versions combined. =Reviews= Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded Mortal Kombat the title of \\"Most Controversial Game of 1993\\". In 1995, the Daily News wrote, \\"the original Mortal Kombat video game debuted in 1992. Its combination of story line, character and mega-violence soon made it a hit worldwide. And the controversy engendered by its blood-gushing special effects only served to boost its popularity.\\" In 2004, readers of Retro Gamer voted Mortal Kombat as the 55th top retro game, with the staff commenting that \\"future versions would address the limitations of the first game, but this is where it all began.\\"Retro Gamer 8, page 69. CraveOnline ranked it second of the top ten 2D fighters of all time, and Forbes called Mortal Kombat one of the \\"most loved arcade games\\" that was \\"king of the arcade\\" in its day, writing that the arcade machines of the original title sell for any price between a few hundred dollars to $2,500.

GamePro hailed the SNES port of Mortal Kombat as having graphics closer to the arcade version than the other three initial home ports, with cleaner definition and a better color palette, and said that while four of the fatalities had been cut, the new finishing moves which replace them \\"are pretty cool, though not as bloody.\\" Comparing it to the Genesis version, they found that the controls are less responsive but the sound is better due to the higher quality and inclusion of the announcer's voice. They concluded, \\"Despite some control glitches and the altered Fatality Moves, Mortal Kombat for the SNES is a great representation of an arcade classic that will more than satisfy most gamers.\\" However, in later decades the SNES port was widely criticized by gaming media for censorship issues. In 2006, IGN named it as the eighth worst arcade-to-console conversion. Nintendo's decision to make the game more family-friendly was also included on GameSpy's list of the dumbest moments in gaming. GamePros review of the Genesis port echoed the comparisons mentioned in their SNES review, but noted that while all the arcade version fatalities are included in \\"Mode A\\", they are noticeably cruder in appearance. They also criticized the fact that the port was developed for the three-button controller, saying this makes some moves awkward to pull off, but concluded, \\"Great graphics, sound, and control in combination with the special Mode A setting make the Genesis Mortal Kombat a beat-em-up force.\\" Highly praising the graphical detail and sharpness, as well as the bloody action when the violence code is enabled, GamePro declared the Game Gear version to be \\"everything its 16-bit big brother is, plus it's portable.\\" They noted that the audio is fairly basic and, as with all four initial home ports, it has issues with the controls, but considered it an overall impressive achievement for a portable system. Reviewing the Game Boy version, GamePro commented, \\"If you think the moves on the other systems are hard to execute, wait until you try to pull a move on the Game Boy. The unresponsive two-button controls are almost impossible to master. The game play is also abysmally slow, and the fighters don't always connect, even when they're close to an opponent.\\" Additionally bemoaning the difficult-to-discern graphics, weak animation, and minimal sound, they deemed it the worst version of the game. The Sega CD version was even more harshly criticized by gaming media. The reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly described it as over-hyped with only minor improvements over the Genesis version, and complained of the lag times. GamePro similarly commented \\"The original Mortal Kombat is back, this time on CD, and you'd think there'd be some improvements. Think again.\\" They criticized that the load times between fights and lag times during fights \\"give the game a quirky, out-of-touch feel.\\" =Controversy= Mortal Kombat was one of many violent video games that came into prominence between 1992 and 1993, generating controversy among parents and public officials. Hearings on video game violence and the corruption of society, headed by Senators Joseph Lieberman and Herb Kohl, were held in late 1992 to 1993. The legislators were especially concerned with the realistic replica of human figures in games, such as Mortal Kombat, Night Trap, Doom and Lethal Enforcers, as opposed to cartoonish characters in other violent games such as Eternal Champions or Time Killers. The result of the hearings was that the entertainment software industry was given one year to form a working rating system or the federal government would intervene and create its own system. Eventually, the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) was conceived, requiring all video games to be rated and for these ratings to be placed on the games' packaging.

Cameron was also named to U.S. senior men's national team following the Winter Cup Invitational at the Las Vegas Sports Center on February 9, 2009. He was the first Michigan Wolverine gymnast to make the national team since Scott Vetere in 1999-2000. After the selection, Cameron told a reporter, \\"It was the most exhilarating and unbelievable thing I've felt in my entire life. I could not believe what had happened.\\" =2010 NCAA season= As a junior in 2010, Cameron was again named to the senior national team after placing third in the all-around at the Winter Cup Invitational in Las Vegas on February 6, 2010. At the Big Ten championship in early April 2010, Cameron won the all-around competition and floor exercise. He was also named the Big Ten Gymnast of the Year. After Cameron won the Big Ten title, Michigan coach Kurt Golder told a reporter, \\"I think he just has an inner drive to succeed and become the best gymnast he can become. It's really hard to find, and we're fortunate at Michigan to have a guy that's driven that hard.\\" Teammate Thomas Kelley added, \\"He's more dedicated than any other gymnast I've ever met. He's got that little extra drive and little extra confidence that I think a lot of us aspire to have in our gymnastics. Just to go out, and know that you're going to hit no matter what. Chris doesn't waver. He's always rock solid.\\" =2010 NCAA individual and team championships= On April 16, 2010, Cameron won the individual all-around title and led Michigan to the team championship at the NCAA Men's Gymnastics championship at Christl Arena in West Point, New York. Cameron won the all-around title with 90.500 points, including 15.600 on the floor, 15.450 on rings and vault, 15.150 on parallel bars, 15.050 on pommel horse and a 13.800 on the horizontal bar. His score was 1.55 points ahead of second-place finisher Steven Legendre. Cameron's Michigan teammate Mel Anton Santander finished third in the all- around. After winning the all-around title, Cameron told International Gymnast Magazine, \\"It's been a lot of hard work, and all I can say is I couldn't dream of a better way to do it. I wouldn't want to do all-around if it was going to hurt the team. But it just so happens I can help the team by doing all-around tonight. I did it, I won, we won. There's nothing better than this.\\" In an interview with The Michigan Daily, he added, \\"I usually grasp everything I've done right away. Not this. This hasn't hit me yet.\\" After winning the NCAA all-around title, Cameron was scheduled to compete with the US national team at the Pan Pacific championships in Melbourne, Australia, starting on April 23, 2010.

With 95 branches, Eastern had a 3.2% market share in Massachusetts in 2016. It was founded in 1818 in Salem, and then moved to Lynn, Massachusetts. The company began an aggressive expansion campaign near the end of the 1990s and moved its headquarters to Boston's Financial District. In 2020, Eastern Bank announced plans to de- mutualize and become a publicly traded corporation. History Eastern Bank was established on April 15, 1818, as Salem Savings Bank and became insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on October 1, 1983. On October 19, 1989, Eastern Savings Bank's parent company Lynn, Massachusetts-based Eastern Bank Corporation, renamed it Eastern Bank, and reorganized it into a mutual holding company, making it the first of its kind in Massachusetts. In the years following its reorganization, it made several acquisitions of local banks. They included Shore Bank And Trust Company (Lynn, April 1992), Malden Trust Company (Malden, May 1992), First Colonial Bank For Savings (Lynn, October 1993), and Saugus Bank And Trust Company (Saugus, November 1994). In 1997, Eastern began an aggressive expansion program with the aim of doubling its size within five years. The first acquisition of the program was initiated in early 1998 when Eastern bought the ten-branch Quincy-based Hibernia Savings Bank and its parent holding company Emerald Isle Bancorp, Inc for $80 million and converted all branches to Eastern Banks. Eastern, with the bulk of its branches north of Boston, gained exposure to the market south of Boston through the acquisition. In November 2002, Eastern Bank merged its operations with its subsidiary, Salem-based Eastern Bank & Trust Company. The following year in March 2003, company headquarters were moved from Lynn to Boston's Financial District, positioning it alongside the regional headquarters of other large banks including FleetBoston Financial and Citizens Bank. Former MassBank location in Downtown Melrose. Divested after temporary rebranding. Continually expanding its footprint in the region, Eastern purchased Wareham's Plymouth Savings Bank in May 2005 and Sharon Co-operative Bank in May 2007. Eastern Bank announced in March 2008 its intention to buy Reading-based MassBank Corp. for $170 million. Eastern's third acquisition in four years, it doubled its deposits in Middlesex County to more than $1.4 billion, garnering a 4% market share in the county. In late June 2010, it was announced that Eastern Bank was the winning bidder to acquire independent Massachusetts bank Wainwright and its 12 branches located in Boston and the surrounding communities. The bank, \\"known for its social activism and lending to nonprofit organizations\\", was purchased for $163 million or $19 a share; almost double its $9.62 closing stock price prior to the announcement. The merger was completed in November 2010, and the 12 branches were converted to Eastern Bank branches in March 2011, and over 100 new employees joined Eastern Bank. In July 2012, Eastern announced a merger with The Community Bank, a $300 million cooperative mutual bank headquartered in Brockton, with five branches in southeastern Massachusetts. The mutual merger of the two banks, including the conversion to Eastern, was concluded on November 30, 2012, and marked the fifth mutual-mutual merger for Eastern. In March 2014, Eastern signed a definitive agreement to acquire Bedford, N.H.-based Centrix Bank & Trust. The acquisition was completed on Friday, Oct. 24, 2015, and the two banks were merged over the weekend. The merger added six new branch locations in southern and coastal New Hampshire, marking the first retail locations for Eastern in the Granite State. In June 2020, Eastern Bank announced that it would be de- mutualizing to become a publicly traded bank.

It was built by the Duke of Buckingham in 1871 as part of a short horse-drawn tramway to allow for the transport of goods from and around his extensive estates in Buckinghamshire and to connect the Duke's estates to the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway at Quainton Road. A lobbying campaign by residents of the town of Brill led to the tramway being converted for passenger use and extended to Brill railway station in 1872, becoming known as the Brill Tramway. Cheaply built and ungraded, and using poor quality locomotives, services on the line were very slow, initially limited to . In the 1890s it was planned to extend the tramway to Oxford, but the scheme was abandoned. Instead, the operation of the line was taken over by the Metropolitan Railway in 1899. Following the 1933 transfer of the Metropolitan Railway to public ownership to become the Metropolitan line of London Transport, Westcott station became a part of the London Underground, despite being over from central London. The management of London Transport believed it very unlikely that the line could ever be made viable, and Westcott station was closed, along with the rest of the line, from 30 November 1935. The station building and its associated house are the only significant buildings from the Brill Tramway to survive other than the former junction station at Quainton Road. Brill Tramway On 23 September 1868 the small Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway (A&BR;) opened, linking the Great Western Railway's station at Aylesbury to the London and North Western Railway's Oxford to Bletchley line at Verney Junction. On 1 September 1894 London's Metropolitan Railway (MR) reached Aylesbury, and shortly afterwards connected to the A&BR; line, with local MR services running to Verney Junction from 1 April 1894. Through trains from the MR's London terminus at Baker Street commenced on 1 January 1897.Connor (2000), p.47 alt=Small green steam locomotive Richard Plantagenet Campbell Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos- Grenville, 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, had long had an interest in railways, and had served as Chairman of the London and North Western Railway from 1852 to 1861. In the early 1870s he decided to build a light railway to carry freight from his estates in Buckinghamshire to the A&BR;'s line at Quainton Road.Oppitz (2000), p.73 The first stage of the line, known as the Wotton Tramway, was a line from Quainton Road via Wotton to a coal siding at Kingswood,Horne (2003), p.18 and opened on 1 April 1871.Demuth (2003), p.6 Intended for use by horse trams, the line was built with longitudinal sleepers to avoid horses tripping on the sleepers.Oppitz (2000), p.74 Lobbying from the nearby town of Brill for the introduction of passenger services on the line led to an extension from Wotton to Brill railway station, at the foot of Brill Hill of a mile (1.2 km) from the hilltop town of Brill itself, in the summer of 1872 and the introduction of two mixed trains each day in each direction,Oppitz (2000), p.75 at which time the line was renamed the Brill Tramway. The Duke bought two Aveling and Porter traction engines modified to work as locomotives for the line, each with a top speed of ,Simpson (2005), p.70 although a speed limit of was enforced. alt=Balding man with a dark bushy beard The Duke died in 1889, and in 1894 the trustees of his estate set up the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company (O&ATC;) with the intention of extending the line from Brill to Oxford. The MR leased the Brill Tramway from 1 December 1899, although the line continued to be owned by the O&ATC.;Demuth (2003), p.18 Services and facilities Westcott station was the second station from Quainton Road, about east of Quainton Road.Mitchell & Smith (2006), ¬ßii The station consisted of a single platform with a small wooden station building,Simpson (2005), p.90 and was immediately south of the village of Westcott,Mitchell & Smith (2006), ¬ßIX which at the time of the railway's opening had a population of about 150. Initially named \\"Westcott Siding\\", the station was renamed \\"Westcott\\" shortly after opening.Mitchell & Smith (2006), ¬ß36 The station was initially built with a single low wooden platform, primarily intended for loading and unloading freight. After the 1899 transfer of services to the Metropolitan Railway, the MR introduced a single Brown Marshall passenger carriage on the line; at this time, a short section of platform was raised to conventional height to allow access to the higher doors on the new carriage.Simpson (2005), p.72 Limited by poor quality locomotives and the bumpy, cheaply laid track which followed the contours of the hills, trains ran very slowly in the area; in 1882 trains took 20 minutes to travel the short distance from Quainton Road to Westcott, and 50 minutes from Westcott to Brill.Mitchell & Smith (2006), ¬ßv From 1872 to 1894 Westcott station was served by two passenger trains per day in each direction, and from 1895 to 1899 the number was increased to three per day. Following the 1899 transfer of services to the Metropolitan Railway, the station was served by four trains per day in each direction until closure in 1935.Mitchell & Smith (2006), ¬ßiv Improvements to the line carried out at the time of the transfer to the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad reduced journey times from Westcott to Quainton Road and Brill to 13 minutes and 28 minutes respectively. alt=Two- storey white house Passenger trains generally served the station only on weekdays, although between 1903 and 1922 trains also ran on Sundays. While the village of Westcott was small, the proximity of Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild's estate at Waddesdon Manor made Westcott one of the busier stations on the branch in terms of passenger and goods traffic. Despite the low frequency of service and relatively low numbers of people using the station, Westcott station was staffed; the single employee's responsibilities included maintaining the oil lamps on the platform and working a nearby level crossing gate.Mitchell & Smith (2006), ¬ß35 As with all employees on the line, staff at the station were contractually obliged to \\"devote themselves exclusively to the service, attend regularly during the appointed hours and to refrain from using improper language, cursing or swearing\\". The single member of staff was provided with a house immediately adjacent to the station; built by the Duke of Buckingham, the house bears the inscription \\"B&C;\\" (Buckingham & Chandos). A small gasworks a short distance to the south of Westcott station opened in 1889 to provide power to Waddesdon Manor and to other buildings on the Rothschild's estate. A short spur line was built from Westcott station to the gasworks, running immediately parallel to the road south from Westcott village. In 1926 the gasworks closed and was replaced by an electrical generator elsewhere on the Waddesdon Manor grounds, and the track of the spur was removed. Closure On 1 July 1933 the Metropolitan Railway, along with London's other underground railways aside from the small Waterloo & City Railway, was taken into public ownership as part of the newly formed London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB). As a consequence, despite it being from the City of London, Westcott station became part of the London Underground network.Foxell (2010), p.66 The Brill Tramway was by this time losing significant sums of money. Goods traffic had dwindled, and unlike other areas served by the former Metropolitan Railway, passenger numbers were low; in 1932 Westcott station saw only 1,560 passengers and collected only ¬£27 (about ¬£ in ) in passenger receipts.Jackson (2006), p.134 Frank Pick, Managing Director of the Underground Group from 1928 and the Chief Executive of the LPTB, saw the lines beyond Aylesbury to Brill and Verney Junction as having little future as financially viable passenger routes,Foxell (2010), p.72 concluding that over ¬£2000 (about ¬£ in ) would be saved simply by closing the Brill Tramway.Horne (2003), p.55 As a consequence, the LPTB decided to abandon all passenger services beyond Aylesbury. The Brill Tramway was closed on 1 December 1935,Foxell (2010), p.73 with the last trains running on 30 November. After closure Upon the withdrawal of London Transport services the lease expired and the railway and stations reverted to the control of the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company. With no funds and no rolling stock of its own the O&ATC; was unable to operate the line, and on 2 April 1936 the entire infrastructure of the line was sold at auction. The cheapest of the 53 lots sold were the Westcott station sign and the oil lamps from the Westcott level crossing, both of which sold for one shilling. The railway house at Westcott was also sold, fetching ¬£305 (about ¬£ in ). Metropolitan line trains ceased to run north of Aylesbury from 6 July 1936. London and North Eastern Railway services (British Rail from 1948) continued to run from London's Marylebone station over the line to Verney Junction via Quainton Road until March 1963. No trace of the line at Westcott remains, but the station building remains in place in the back garden of the former station house, now a private residence, and carries an exact replica of its original \\"Westcott\\" station sign. Aside from the junction station at Quainton Road, now preserved as the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre, the two buildings at Westcott are the only significant buildings associated with the Brill Tramway to have survived.Oppitz (2000), p.79 See also *Infrastructure of the Brill Tramway Notes and references =Notes= =References= =Bibliography=   Further reading   Category:Brill Tramway Category:Disused railway stations in Buckinghamshire Category:Former Metropolitan and Great Central Joint Railway stations Category:Metropolitan line stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1871 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1935 ","title":"Westcott railway station"},{"id":"27027738","text":"Borth is an unincorporated community in Waushara County, Wisconsin, United States.

He was signed by the San Diego Chargers as an undrafted free agent in 2015 and then signed by the Jacksonville Jaguars on October 17, 2017. He played college football at Texas A&M; and is a former professional soccer goalkeeper. Lambo is the third-most accurate field goal kicker in NFL history behind Justin Tucker and Harrison Butker. Early years Born in Lansing, Michigan, Lambo moved with his family to Crystal Lake, Illinois when he was a small child. He played club soccer for the Chicago Magic before moving to Middleton, Wisconsin in the summer of 2005, where he attended Middleton High School for less than two months before signing a Generation Adidas contract and joining the USA Residency Program in Bradenton, Florida. At the age of 15, he spent the summer training with Everton F.C. during their US tour in 2006 on the recommendation of US international Tim Howard and was invited to Finch Farm before being offered a professional contract on the provision that he could secure an EU passport due to his Greek heritage. Professional soccer career =Club career= Lambo was drafted in the first round (8th overall) of the 2008 MLS SuperDraft by FC Dallas. He played in the MLS Reserve Division, and was a named first team substitute on several occasions, but missed most of the second half of the 2008 season after he broke his jaw in a reserve team game. Lambo never played in an MLS match, but did appear for his team in an international friendly match versus Costa Rica‚Äôs CS Herediano in June 2009. Lambo was loaned to USSF Division 2 Professional League expansion team FC Tampa Bay for the 2010 season. He made his professional debut on May 14, 2010 in a 2‚Äì1 victory over the Carolina RailHawks. Lambo was waived by Dallas at the end of the 2011 season. He went on trial with D.C. United and Sheffield United in January 2012. After turning down offers from the NASL and the chance of becoming a MLS pool goalkeeper, he retired from professional soccer at the age of 21. =International career= Lambo made two appearances for the United States U-17 national team during the 2007 FIFA U-17 World Cup after starting the competition as a substitute. He made his debut in the third and last group stage match against Belgium, playing the whole game and keeping a clean sheet against a side that fielded future Premier League players Eden Hazard and Christian Benteke and was the goalkeeper in the 2‚Äì1 loss against Germany in the round of 16. He was an unused substitute for the United States U-20 national team at the 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup. College years In the Fall of 2012, Lambo enrolled at Texas A&M; University and joined the football team as a placekicker. He became starting field goal kicker after overtaking Taylor Bertolet during the 2013 season (Bertolet remained the kick-off specialist). His first career appearance came on September 22, 2012 when he made an extra point against South Carolina State. His first game-winning field goal came against Ole Miss on October 12, 2013. With the game tied at 38 and only four seconds remaining in the game, Lambo kicked a 33-yard field goal to win the game for the Aggies. Lambo converted all 59 extra point attempts for the 2014 season. He went on to compete in the 2015 NFLPA Collegiate Bowl. Professional American football career =San Diego / Los Angeles Chargers= On May 2, 2015, after going undrafted in the 2015 NFL Draft, Lambo signed a contract as a free agent with the San Diego Chargers. Lambo was brought in for competition for the kicker spot. On September 5, Lambo won the starting job over the incumbent veteran Nick Novak. He displayed a strong leg during exhibition games, while Novak did not have a touchback in the final half of the 2014 season. In the 2015 season, Lambo converted 26-of-32 field goal attempts. On September 2, 2017, Lambo was released by the Chargers after losing the starting kicker job to rookie Younghoe Koo. =Jacksonville Jaguars= On October 17, 2017, Lambo signed with the Jacksonville Jaguars. On November 12, 2017, Lambo made a game-winning 30 yard field goal in overtime to give the Jaguars a 20-17 win over his former team, the Chargers. In Week 8 of the 2018 season, Lambo kicked a new career-long 57-yard field goal against the Philadelphia Eagles. He was placed on injured reserve on December 28, 2018 with a groin injury. On February 13, 2019, Lambo signed a four-year, $15.5 million contract extension with the Jaguars. In Week 4, Lambo converted two extra points and went 4-for-4 on field goals, including the game-winning 33-yarder as time expired in a 26-24 win over the Denver Broncos, earning him AFC Special Teams Player of the Week. In Week 7, Lambo hit all four of his field goals and an extra point in a 27-17 win over the Cincinnati Bengals, earning him his second AFC Special Teams Player of the Week award of the season. On September 23, 2020, Lambo was placed on injured reserve with a hip injury. Personal life Lambo married his wife Megan in June 2018.

(1984). Revisione del genre Emarginula Lamarck, 1801 in Mediterraneo. Lao. Soc. Ital. Malacol. (Milano) 21 Description The shell of the slit limpet has an elevated conical profile with its apex strongly curved backwards, but never overhanging the posterior margin. The color of the shell is dull white, gray or yellowish. The shell is usually about 10 mm long (but can reach a length of 15 mm), 8 mm high and 6 mm wide. The shell has a reticulate (= net-like) sculpture with 25-35 radial ribs, alternating stronger and weaker, intersecting with spiraled ridges. There is a narrow and deep slit at the anterior margin above the mantle cavity. An exhalent siphon projects thorough this slit. The aperture of the shell occupies the whole undersurface of the shell and lacks an operculum. The shield-shaped foot is broader anteriorly. It has on each side ten well- developed tentacles at the epipodium (the lateral grooves between foot and mantle). There is an additional tentacle at the right side at the back of the head. The larvae have a short planktonic development, non-planktotrophic as usual in Vetigastropoda and Patellogastropoda WoRMS : Emerginula fissura Distribution and habitat The slit limpet is a common keyhole limpet and can be found along the eastern Atlantic, west European coasts, as far north as Norway and the Faroe Islands and south to the Canary Islands. It is a rare in the western Mediterranean Sea. It thrives on the lower shore and the subtidal zone to a depth of 265 m on rocks and hard substrates where sponges occur. Feeding habits The slit limpet is omnivorous. It is a deposit feeder, creeping slowly along a rock surface and grazing on algae as well as sponges. References Gofas, S.; Le Renard, J.; Bouchet, P.

Its jazz poetry style focuses on descriptions of Harlem (a neighborhood of New York City) and its mostly African-American inhabitants. The original edition was 75 pages long and comprised 91 individually titled poems, which were intended to be read as a single long poem. Hughes' prefatory note for the book explained his intentions in writing the collection: > In terms of current Afro-American popular music and the sources from which > it progressed‚Äîjazz, ragtime, swing, blues, boogie-woogie, and be-bop‚Äîthis > poem on contemporary Harlem, like be-bop, is marked by conflicting changes, > sudden nuances, sharp and impudent interjections, broken rhythms, and > passages sometimes in the manner of a jam session, sometimes the popular > song, punctuated by the riffs, runs, breaks, and disc-tortions of the music > of a community in transition. The primary motif of the poem is the \\"dream deferred\\", which represents the opposition between Harlem of the 1950s and the rest of the world. Other motifs include boogie-woogie and discrimination against African Americans. The poem is characterized by its use of the montage, a cinematic technique of quickly cutting from one scene to another in order to juxtapose disparate images, and its use of contemporary jazz modes like boogie-woogie, bop and bebop, both as subjects in the individual short poems and as a method of structuring and writing the poetry. The poem is divided into five sections (although some editions contain six); each section represents a different time of day in Harlem, moving from dawn through the night to the dawn of the following day. The poem begins and ends with the same two lines: \\"Good morning, daddy! / Ain't you heard?\\" Montage of a Dream Deferred was Langston Hughes' first major publication following the end of World War II. Its themes include the subjugation of the black community, African-American racial consciousness and history, and the need for social change to resolve the injustices faced by the residents of Harlem.

It comprises the same area as the administrative Stenkyrka District, established on 1January 2016.  Geography  Stenkyrka in the northwest part of the island. The medieval Stenkyrka Church is situated in Stenkyrka. Near the church is a minor settlement with a few houses. The fishing village Lickershamn, noted for the stack Jungfrun is situated in Stenkyrka. , Stenkyrka Church belongs to Stenkyrka parish in Norra Gotlands pastorat, along with the churches in Martebo, Tingst√§de and Lummelunda. One of the asteroids in the Asteroid belt, 10125 Stenkyrka, is named after this place.  History  This settlement is where the Stenkyrka spearhead was found. It is incised with the oldest known runic inscription known in Sweden. = Little Bj√§rs Grave Field = A bit east of the church in Stenkyrka is one of the largest grave fields on Gotland, the Little Bj√§rs Grave Field (Lilla Bj√§rs gravf√§lt). Along one of the oldest roads in this part of the island, now not more than a trail, are more than 1,000 visible graves from the Stone Age and the Bronze Age. Most of the graves are cairns and circular tumuli. Bases for picture stones have been found in the field. They have remained after the picture stones have been moved and incorporated in the walls of the Stenkyrka Church. Some of these have later been moved to Gotland Museum. The grave field is about in a general northeast‚Äìsouthwest direction. It contains about 750 identifiable graves above ground, but it is difficult to ascertain the borders between the mounds. A number of the mounds have depressions in the middle, about ten have visible remains of cists made of limestone slabs, about 30 graves have grave orbs. Among the graves is also a stone ship. A large number of the graves have been damaged by modern constructions and farming. The modern road bisects the area in an angle to the old road that the field have been established around.

He was the nephew of the German physiologist Adolf Eugen Fick, and the son of the German anatomy professor Franz Ludwig Fick. When Fick was three years old, his mother died, and when he was six, his father, anatomy professor Ludwig Fick, died. Soon afterwards, he was raised in Adolf Fick's family. Adolf Fick was his uncle, godfather, and a famous physiologist, and influenced his nephew's studies in ophthalmology. The younger Fick studied medicine in W√ºrzburg, Z√ºrich, Marburg, and Freiburg. In 1884, Fick traveled to Germany to marry Marie, the daughter of Johannes Wislicenus; he later had eight children with her. In 1888, he constructed and fitted what was to be considered the first successful model of a contact lens: an afocal scleral contact shell made from heavy brown glass, which he tested first on rabbits, then on himself, and lastly on a small group of volunteers. It was considered the first successful model of a contact lens. His idea was advanced independently by several innovators in the years that followed. During World War I, Fick headed field hospitals in France, Russia and Turkey. At the same time he continued working on ophthalmologic anatomy and optics.

Wadmal (Old Norse: va√∞m√°l; Norwegian: vadm√•l, \\"cloth measure\\") is a coarse, dense, usually undyed wool fabric woven in Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Greenland, and the Orkney, Faroe and Shetland Islands from the Middle Ages into the 18th century. Wadmal was woven on the warp-weighted loom used throughout these areas of Norwegian influence, and was usually a 2/2 twill weave, although some medieval sources outside Iceland describe wadmal as tabby or plain-woven. In remote regions, wadmal remained the primary fabric for working people's clothing into the 18th century. Wadmal was a medium of exchange throughout Scandinavia. Wadmal was accepted as currency in Sweden, Iceland, Shetland, and Ireland, and exchange rates defined the equivalent of various grades of wadmal (measured in ells) in silver and in cows. According to Bruce Gelsinger, the term watmal was known in Germany and the southern Baltic region as a rough cloth primarily used by the poor.  Wadmal in Iceland  Wadmal was the main export of Iceland, where length, width, thread count, and weight for different grades were fixed by law. Iceland was also the largest producer of wadmal in the North Atlantic. Producing and selling inadequate wadmal was punishable by law in Iceland; for instance, in Lj√≥svetninga Saga, one individual is outlawed for selling wadmal full of holes. Wadmal was a dominant form of legal currency in Iceland ‚Äì both within Iceland and to some extent in the Icelanders‚Äô foreign trade - from the 11th (at the earliest) to 17th century (at the latest). According to archeologist Michele Hayeur Smith, wadmal was significant enough in Iceland ‚Äúthat its production nearly eliminated other textile types from the island‚Äôs woven repertoire.‚Äù Some have argued that, given the importance of wadmal in Iceland and the fact that women primarily produced it, that gender relations in Iceland may have been more equal than was previously thought: \\"making va√∞m√°l was making money and this may have provided women with a source of power that was socially understood, as the weavers knew best the differences between good and poor-quality va√∞m√°l. This seeming symbiosis may stem from the small size of the Icelandic colony, the harsh nature of the North Atlantic environment and the need for collaboration between the sexes to guarantee survival. This is not to say that resistance did not exist, but it may have been subtle and reflected in the values and symbolic associations connected to the making of cloth\\".

Distribution The species from this genus can be found in temperate waters of Australia, except Amblychilepas platyactis that is found along the Atlantic coast of the Cape Peninsula, South Africa. Description Amblychilepas is closely associated with Dendrofissurella and Medusafissurella with which it shares radular and shell characters. The body of species in this genus is larger than the shell. The anterior part of the oval shell is narrower than the rest. Both ends of the shell are somewhat raised. The sculpture of the shell shows fine radial ribs. The upper mantle fold only slightly envelops the edge of the shell. The apical opening (foramen) is elongate-oval and situated almost in the center. Long papillae extend from the mantle towards the foramen, as in A. nigrita. The foot extends behind the shell with a length larger than the shell. Contrary to Dendrofissurella and Medusafissurella, the foremost part of the foot (propodium) is unmodified. The large outer lateral tooth of the radula is quadricuspid ( = with four cusps).

In the early 17th century, the Dutch East India Company (Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie, VOC) began the campaign to destroy Portuguese power in the East. At that time, the Portuguese had transformed Malacca into an impregnable fortress (the Fortaleza de Malaca), controlling access to the sea lanes of the Straits of Malacca and the spice trade there. The Dutch started by launching small incursions and skirmishes against the Portuguese. The first serious attempt was the siege of Malacca in 1606 by the third VOC fleet from Holland with eleven ships, led by Admiral Cornelis Matelief de Jonge that lead to the naval battle of Cape Rachado. Although the Dutch were routed, the Portuguese fleet of Martim Afonso de Castro, the Viceroy of Portuguese India, suffered heavier casualties and the battle rallied the forces of the Sultanate of Johor in an alliance with the Dutch. The Dutch with their local allies assaulted and wrested Malacca from the Portuguese in January 1641. This combined Dutch-Johor effort effectively destroyed the last bastion of Portuguese power, removing their influence in the Malay archipelago. In line with the agreement with Johor in 1606, the Dutch took control of Malacca and agreed not to seek territories or wage war with the Malay kingdoms.
