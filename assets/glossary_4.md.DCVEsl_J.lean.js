It is white with a pale olivaceous periostracum. The smooth nucleus consists of about one whorl and five subsequent whorls. The spiral sculpture consists of two strong cords with wider interspaces and a thud on which the suture is laid and which forms the margin of the base. There is also a small thread between the suture and the posterior cord and on the body whorl a similar thread in the interspaces. On the base there are six or seven smaller closer cords separated by obscurely channeled interspaces between the verge of a narrow umbilicus and the basal margin. The axial sculpture consists of (on the penultimate whorl about 20) retractive riblets extending from suture to periphery, with wider interspaces, slightly nodulous at the intersections with the spiral cords. There are also close obvious incremental regular lines over the whole surface. The simple, rounded aperture is quadrate. There is a glaze on the body. The inner lip is slightly thickened.

Spawning and development Spawning takes place during the spring in the San Juan Islands, WA, USA. Prior to spawning two to four snails move close together, one of these is a female and all others are male. A female release eggs only when in close proximity to a male. Eggs are released in a mucus strand 2‚Äì3 eggs wide. Eggs are orange to pinkish red, 180‚Äì200 ¬µm in diameter, and each egg is covered by a gelatinous layer 10‚Äì30 ¬µm thick. Sperm release is not visible during spawning but must occur since eggs in newly produced egg masses are fertilized. The female uses the leading edge of her foot to form the mucus strand into a globular egg mass 0.5‚Äì1.5 cm in diameter. Each egg masses contains 90‚Äì1000 eggs, and egg masses are anchored to algal surfaces at both ends of the egg mass. All embryonic and larval development takes place in the egg mass and young emerge as juvenile snails. Development proceeds as eggs undergo spiral cleavage. Timing of development at 7‚Äì9 ¬∞C proceeds as embryos reached the gastrula stage 1.3 days after fertilization, the trochophore stage 2.1 days after fertilization, the veliger stage 3.3 days after fertilization, torsion between 4.5‚Äì5 days after fertilization, metamorphosis at 10.5 days, and hatched and crawled out of the egg mass as a juvenile snail at 12.1 days.

High myopia Myopia is one of the leading causes of blindness in the world.Grossniklaus, H.E. and W.R. Green, Pathologic findings in pathologic myopia. Retina, 1992. 12(2): p. 127-33.Bores, L.D., Scleral Reinforcement, in Refractive Eye Surgery. 2001, Blackwell Science, Inc.: USA. p. 466-491. It is caused by both genetic Curtin, B.J., The nature of pathological myopia, in The Myopias. 1985, Harper & Row: Philadelphia. p. 237-239. and environmental factors,Saw, S., et al., Myopia: gene-environment interaction. Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore, 2000. 29(3): p. 290. such as mechanical stretching, excessive eye work and accommodation, as well as an elevated intraocular pressure. It affects both children and adults. In many cases, myopia will stabilize once the growth process has been completed, but in more severe chronic cases, loss of vision can occur. Degenerative myopia, also known as malignant, pathological, or progressive myopia, is characterized by posterior sclera elongation and thinning (at least 25.5 mm to 26.5 mm) and high refractive errors of at least -5 to -7.5 diopters with an increase per year. There may also be changes in the fundus, including posterior staphyloma, caused by the eye growing posteriorly and losing its spherical shape. Since enlargement of the eye does not progress at a uniform rate, abnormal protrusions of uveal tissue may occur through weak points in the eye. Staphyloma is marked by a thinning of sclera collagen bundles and decreased number of collagen striations. It correlates with a large posterior temporal bulge. Curtin described five varieties, based on size, shape, and change in appearance of the optic nerve and retinal vessels, but the posterior pole type is the most common.Curtin, B.J., The posterior staphyloma of pathologic myopia. Trans Am Ophthalmol Soc, 1977. 75: p. 67-86. As the posterior staphyloma enlarges, choroidal tissue becomes thin and Bruch's membrane begins to break, creating lesions called lacquer cracks. Neovascularization may occur, causing blood vessels to protrude through the cracks and leak in the space underneath the photoreceptor cell layer. This hemorrhaging can lead to scarring and macular degeneration, causing vision to gradually deteriorate. If left untreated, high myopia can cause retinal detachment, glaucoma, and a higher risk of cataracts. History The condition of posterior staphyloma in high myopia was first described by Scarpa in the 1800s.Scarpa, A. A. (1818). A Treatise on the Principal Diseases of the Eye. London. Speculation about reinforcement of the eye began in the 19th century, when Rubin noted that sclera reinforcement ‚Äúis probably the only one of all the surgical techniques [for myopia] which attempts to correct a cause, rather than an effect‚Äù.Rubin, M.L., Surgical procedures available for influencing refractive error., in Refractive Anomalies of the Eye. 1966, US Government Printing Office: Washington. Procedures in early literature aimed at shortening the length of the eyeball by resecting a ring of sclera from the equator of the eye. Later procedures focused on modifying the axial length of the eye, by preventing elongation and staphyloma progression by placing grafts over the posterior part of the eye. In 1930, Shevelev proposed the idea of transplantation of fascia lata for sclera reinforcement.Shevelev, M.M., Operation against high myopia and scleralectasia with aid of the transplantation of fascia lata on thinned sclera. Russian Oftalmol J, 1930. 11(1): p. 107-110. Curtin promoted the use of donor-sclera grafting for reinforcement.Curtin, B.J., Surgical support of the posterior sclera: Part II. Clinical results. Am J Ophthalmol, 1961. 52: p. 253. In 1976, Momose first introduced Lyodura, a material derived from processed cadaver dura mater.Momose, A., Surgical treatment of myopia.... with special references to posterior scleral support operation and radial keratotomy. Vol. 31. 1983. 759-767. At this point, many different surgeons made alterations to existing techniques. Snyder and Thompson modified reinforcement techniques and had positive outcomes,Snyder, A. and F. Thompson, A simplified technique for surgical treatment of degenerative myopia. American Journal of Ophthalmology, 1972. 74(2): p. 273. while others, like Curtin and Whitmore, expressed dissatisfaction with their negative conclusions.Curtin, B. and W. Whitmore, Long-term results of scleral reinforcement surgery. American Journal of Ophthalmology, 1987. 103(4): p. 544. Purpose The surgery aims to cover the thinning posterior pole with a supportive material to withstand intraocular pressure and prevent further progression of the posterior staphyloma. The strain is reduced, although damage from the pathological process cannot be reversed. By stopping the progression of the disease, vision may be maintained or improved. Methods of surgery There are three basic techniques, referred to as X-shaped, Y-shaped, and single strip support. In X-shaped and Y-shaped, the arms run the risk of the being pulled medially, which would press on the optic nerve and could result in optic nerve atrophy. In single strip support, the material covers the posterior pole vertically between the optic nerve and insertion of the inferior oblique muscle. Often, this method is preferred, since it is the easiest method for placement, provides the widest area of support, and reduces the risk of optic nerve interference. Materials Many different materials have been used in the past, including fascia lata, Lyodura (lyophilized human dura), Gore-Tex, Zenoderm (porcine skin dermis),Gerinec, A., & Slezakova, G. (2001). Posterior scleroplasty in children with severe myopia. Bratisl Lek Listy, 102(2), 73-78. animal tendons, and donor's or cadaver‚Äôs sclera.Balashova, N., Ghaffariyeh, A., & Honarpisheh, N. (2010). Scleroplasty in progressive myopia. Eye.Ward, B., Tarutta, E., & Mayer, M. (2009). The efficacy and safety of posterior pole buckles in the control of progressive high myopia. Eye, 23(12), 2169-2174. Human sclera is thought to offer the best support, as well as Lyodura, which is biologically compatible with the eyeball and has sufficient tensile strength. Artificial materials, such as nylon or silicone, are not suggested. Sclera from cadaver‚Äôs or animal tendons run the risk of being rejected. Procedure While there have been many modifications, Thompson‚Äôs procedure has often been used as a basis.Thompson, F., Scleral Reinforcement. Chapter 10., in Myopia Surgery. 1990, Macmillan: New York. p. 267-297. First, the conjunctiva and Tenon's capsule are incised about 6 mm from the corneal limbus. The lateral, superior, and inferior recti muscles are separated using a strabismus hook. The connecting tissue is then separated from the posterior pole, as well as the inferior oblique muscle. The strip of material is passed under the separated muscles, and pushed down deeply towards the posterior pole. Both ends of the material strip are crossed over the medial rectus muscle and sutured to the sclera on the medial side of the superior and inferior recti muscles. The conjunctiva and Tenon's capsule are then closed together. Complications Long-term complication rates are usually low, but short-term complications may include chemosis, choroidal edema or hemorrhage, damage to the vortex vein, and transient motility problems. Controversy Scleral reinforcement surgery is not presently popular in the United States, and there has been a scarcity of published clinical studies. Donor sclera material is also difficult to acquire and store, and artificial materials are still being tested. This procedure is much more popular in other countries, such as the former Soviet Union and Japan. There is also controversy regarding in what developmental stage this procedure should be performed. Some feel efforts should be made as soon as possible to arrest progression in children. Others feel that the procedure should only be done in cases where high myopia is indicated with macular changes. Furthermore, different surgeons have particular criteria that must be met by patients in order to receive surgery.

These gastropods feed on very small plants and filamentous algae grazed on coral and rocks. Life cycle Tectus niloticus can live for up to 15 years and are able to reproduce at about 2 years of age. Females release more than 1 million eggs. Breeding period occurs during spring tides with nocturnal spawning.Sealife Base The eggs fertilised by males hatch to larval stages. Embryos develop into free- swimming planktonic marine larvae (trocophore) and later into juvenile veligers that drift with currents before settling on a rocky surface. After 2 or more years they may become adults. Description shell of Tectus niloticus on display at the Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di Milano The length of the shell varies between 50 mm and 165 mm, its diameter between 100 mm and 120 mm. The large, ponderous, shell has a conical shape, appearing subperforate. It is covered by a corneous striate, brown or yellowish cuticle usually lost on the upper whorls. Its color beneath the cuticle is white, longitudinally striped with crimson, violet or reddish brown. The base of the shell is maculate or radiately strigate with a lighter shade of the same. The spire is strictly conical. The apex is acute, usually eroded. The shell contains 8-10 whorls. The upper ones are tuberculate at the sutures, and spirally beaded, the following flat on their outer surfaces, smooth, separated by linear suture. The body whorl is expanded, dilated and compressed at the obtuse periphery, more or less convex below, indented at the axis. The umbilical tract is covered by a spiral pearly deeply entering callus. The aperture is transverse and very oblique. The columella is oblique, terminating in a denticle below, and with a strong spiral fold above, deeply inserted into the axis. The operculum is circular, thin, corneous, orange-brown, and composed of about 10 whorls.Tryon (1889), Manual of Conchology XI, Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia Human culture The very large shells of this species have a very thick inner layer of nacre. They are used commercially to make mother of pearl buttons, mother of pearl beads, pendants and so on. In 2006, for example, the sole commercial export of the Wallis and Futuna Islands was 19 tons of \\"Trochus\\" shells, valued at US$122,000. Aquaculture Tectus niloticus is a highly sought after resource in the Pacific and Indo-Pacific regions. This has resulted in the species being over-harvested. By 2007 the Solomon Islands, Fiji and Papua New Guinea have the most depleted stocks, with four surveyed sites in the Solomon Islands in 2006 averaging a density of only 11 trochus ha^-1. Releasing hatchery-reared juveniles is an option to replenish reduced wild stocks. Methods of culture are still under assessment and development where experiments have been conducted in Vanuatu;, Australia, Indonesia and Vietnam. Cage-based cultures have proven effective because they allow control of food and predators, both of which contribute greatly to the growth and survival of juveniles;. Other benefits of sea cages include lower cost, easy to construct and transport, manageability and the advantage of using existing water bodies. Hatchery-reared individuals are usually lab- spawned and raised. Broodstock can be collected from local wild populations and from sites in which juveniles are to be released. Spawning is usually induced by heat shock under laboratory conditions;. Larvae are grown on coral rubble and shell grit, and are fed with benthic diatoms. (Nitzschia spp. and Navicula spp.). Juveniles used in cage experiments have an initial size of 8 mm shell diameter. Other experiments start at 15mm basal shell width. The release size of cultured juveniles is important to ensure their survival and response to predators, where the larger the individual the less vulnerable it is to predation. A release size of 35mm (basal shell width, BSW) is recommended. The period of growth to this suitable size is about 6 months under optimum conditions. However, producing large individuals is costly. Alternatives such as high density releases of small juveniles and over large areas are less expensive and are thought to be solutions that can reduce predation pressure from fish species such as Choerodon cyanodus and Diodontidae and crustaceans such as Mancinella tubercosa and Calappa hepatica. Hatchery and transit conditions are also factors that may affect the vulnerability of juveniles to predators. It is recommended animals are reared on natural substrata before release. The growth of the cultured individuals can depend on the density of juveniles in the cages and the likely causes are competition for food and space. An initial density of 100 trochus m-2 achieves a basal diameter of 10-20mm which can then be reduced to 50 trochus m-2 to yield basal diameters 25-40mm. Beyond this range a density of less than 10 trochus m-2 is recommended. Seaweed and algae are the main food and these grow on the dead corals and rocks which may occur naturally at the cultured sites or collected from adjacent areas and placed at the bottom of the cages. It is recommended that for cages with juveniles sized >30mm, these seaweed-covered rocks should be replaced 2 to 3 times a month and cover over 50% of the area. Cage design is important in preventing escape of juveniles and entry of predators and also shading of algal and seaweed on rocks. Recommended designs include cages with 8x8mm plastic mesh and an aluminium frame. Steel reef, plastic reef and plastic floating cages have proven ineffective as steel reef cages allowed high mortality from predator entry and plastic cages induced shading of the rocks algae and seaweed are attached to which results in low productivity. Suitable locations for reef cages are sand and rubble bottom reef bases exposed to less wave action or fore-flat zones which are 10m behind the reef crest with water depths of 0 to 2.5m during spring-tides. Shifting sand and sediment deposition areas may smother foraging surfaces and need to be avoided when allocating cages;. Wind-ward sections of the reef flat are considered suitable sites. Floating cages require frequent cleaning to remove fouling species and allow high water flow and/ or nutrient flux for high algal biomass and quality. Other environmental factors such as water temperature and salinity can have seasonal and episodic effects on the growth of the juveniles. Suitable release sites of trochus juveniles into the wild include unconsolidated coral rubble and areas where predators are absent. It is common that juveniles are placed upright inside a cover such as a reef crevice; or under macroalgae as a means of predator protection. The success of released individuals in contributing to wild populations can be measured by the mark and recapture method. However the validity of this method may be limited by factors such as detection methods, predation, escape of juveniles, translocation of juveniles by strong currents or detection may simply be not carried out.

Its color pattern is whitish, streaked and maculated with brown or green, the darker color often predominating. The conic spire is acute. The 5-6 whorls are convex, irregularly spirally lirate and finely regularly lamellosely longitudinally striate;. They are subcarinate above. The sutures are subcanaliculate. The body whorl is usually biangulate, with a coronal and one or two submedian lirae prominent and armed with more or less numerous vaulted scales or spines. The aperture measures about half the length of the shell. It is pearly white within. The crenate lip is slightly produced at its base. The umbilical region is sometimes slightly indented. The operculum is flat inside, with five whorls and a subcentral nucleus. Its outer surface is finely tuberculate, cinereous or pale olive.G.W.

Apparently, he had previously claimed to be the rightful Patriarch of Antioch ; though these claims appear to be exaggerated, he was evidently at least a bishop. His mysterious appearance in, and disappearance from, Portuguese India caused a great uproar there, and resulted directly in a revolt by the Saint Thomas Christians against Portuguese rule and the establishment of an independent Malankara Church. Biography Ahatallah's biography is obscure. Many earlier scholars, including the Lebanese Orientalist Joseph Simon Assemani and Edward Ren√© Hambye, believed he was a Jacobite, a member of the Syriac Orthodox Church.Vadakkekara, pp. 80‚Äì81 and note. However, later research by Joseph Thekedathu, relying on additional documents found in the archives in the Vatican and Goa, has established further details of his life.Neill, p. 317. He was born in Aleppo, Syria, in 1590, and did enter the Syriac Orthodox Church, eventually being consecrated Bishop of Damascus. While bishop he converted to the Catholic Church, and in 1632 he traveled to Rome. He stayed there for over a year, and became fluent in Italian. Eventually he requested to return to Syria, where he vowed he would bring the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch, Ignatius Hidayat Aloho, into communion with Rome. What happened thereafter is unclear. Ahatallah was certainly unsuccessful in converting Hidayat Aloho before the patriarch died in 1639. After that point, Ahatallah apparently began claiming he was Hidayat Aloho's rightful successor, and began styling himself \\"Ignatius\\", the name traditionally born by Syriac Orthodox Patriarchs. Whatever the base for this claim, opposition by the Ottoman Empire precluded him from ever visiting the patriarchal see, and Ahatallah was sent instead to Persia, which had no Latin Rite bishop at the time. By 1646 he was in Cairo, where he seems to have been known at the court of the Coptic Pope of Alexandria. That year he sent a correspondence to the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith (Propaganda Fide) in Rome, but received no response for several years. While Ahatallah was in Cairo, the Pope of Alexandria, Mark VI, received a letter from Thomas, Archdeacon of the Saint Thomas Christian community in India. Thomas was at loggerheads with the Portuguese administration in India, and had begun appealing to various foreign patriarchs ‚Äì the Patriarch of the Church of the East in Persia, the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch in Syria, and Pope Mark in Egypt ‚Äì for assistance. Either unable or unwilling to send someone from his own church, Mark evidently suggested that Ahatallah might go to India instead. Having heard nothing from Propaganda Fide, Ahatallah seized the opportunity. Ahatallah arrived in India in 1652, coming first to Surat.Neill, p. 316. There he made the acquaintance of the Capuchin monks, but afraid of being taken by the authorities and subjected to the Inquisition, he quietly boarded a Dutch vessel bound for Mylapore, which he reached most likely in August 1562.Neill, pp. 316‚Äì317. There, he began claiming that the Pope had commissioned him as \\"Patriarch of the Whole of India and of China\\", and that his patriarchal name was Ignatius. The Portuguese decided he was an impostor, and possibly a heretic, and summarily arrested him and put him in the custody of the Jesuits. However, the Jesuits extended considerable freedom to him, and allowed him to meet with Zachariah Cherrian Unni and two other members of the Saint Thomas Christian clergy. Ahatallah greatly impressed the native clergymen, who returned to their home region of Kerala with a letter from their community's new \\"Patriarch\\". Historian Stephen Neill notes the difficulty in determining what of Ahatallah's story can be accepted as true. There is no evidence that the Roman pope had authorized him to go to India, let alone claim to be its Patriarch. Similarly, the Coptic pope could not have given him the commission, as he could assert no authority in India, which was under the jurisdiction of other patriarchs ‚Äì historically the Patriarch of the Church of the East and now the Roman pope. However, Neill notes that however exaggerated these claims were, there is little reason to doubt that Ahatallah was at least a bishop, who had converted from the Syriac Orthodox Church to Catholicism. Disappearance and aftermath Ahatallah's appearance had joyed the Saint Thomas Christians, who had hoped for a new ecclesiastical leader to free them from the power of the Portuguese Padroado, which since the Synod of Diamper in 1599 had formally controlled church life in India. Soon, however, the Jesuit Manoel de Leira secretly alerted the Portuguese authorities about Ahatallah's activities, and they put him on a ship headed for Cochin and Goa.Frykenberg, p. 367. Hearing of this, Archdeacon Thomas led his militia to Cochin and demanded to meet with Ahatallah and examine his credentials. The Portuguese officials refused. They noted that no Patriarch could be legally assigned to India without the dispensation of the Portuguese, and informed Thomas that Ahatallah had already been sent to Goa.Frykenberg, p. 367‚Äì368. Ahatallah was never heard from again in India, and the Saint Thomas Christians soon suspected that the Portuguese had murdered him. Rumours spread that the Portuguese had drowned him in Cochin harbour before the ships even left for Goa, or even that they had tried him for heresy and burned him at the stake. In reality, it appears that Ahatallah did in fact reach Goa, and was then sent on to Lisbon with the ultimate goal of having his case decided in Rome. Evidently, however, he died in Paris in 1655, before reaching Rome.Neill, p. 319.Vadakkekara, p. 81. After Ahatallah's death representatives of the Saint Thomas Christians came together at the Church of Our Lady in Mattancherry and swore the Coonan Cross Oath, in which they vowed they would never again submit to the Portuguese. By this action, an independent Thomas Christian church, known as the Malankara Church, was formed, and its leaders soon decided that Archdeacon Thomas should be elevated to the episcopal position they had earlier hoped Ahatallah would fill. Supporting this, Anjilimoothil Ittithommen, one of the senior priests, produced two letters supposedly from Ahatallah that authorized the Archdeacon's consecration as bishop and detailed a ceremony facilitating it.Neill, pp. 320‚Äì321. According to these letters, if no bishop could be found to perform the consecration, twelve priests could lay their hands on the candidate instead.Vadakkekara, p. 82. According to Stephen Neill, these letters were almost certainly not authentic, and were probably forged by Ittithommen himself. Some were skeptical of this atypical ceremony, but Ahatallah's reputation and the enthusiastic mood ensured that it went ahead as planned. Thomas was consecrated by twelve priests, who laid one of the letters attributed to Ahatallah on his head, and afterward he acted fully as the metropolitan of Malankara.

Both were anti- communist Asian nations fighting against rival communist regimes, the People's Republic of China and North Vietnam (Democratic Republic of Vietnam). From November 1967, the ROC secretly operated a cargo transport detachment to assist the US and the ROV. It was based on existing formation of the 34th squadron of ROC Air force. The unit's strength included two cargo aircraft, seven flight officers and two mechanics, even though a higher number of military personnel was involved through rotation. It was tasked with air transportation, airdrop and electronic reconnaissance. Some 25 members of the unit were killed, among them 17 pilots and co-pilots, and three aircraft were lost. Other ROC involvement in Vietnam included a secret listening station, special reconnaissance and raiding squads, military advisers and civilian airline operations (which cost a further two aircraft due to Vietnamese individually operated AA missiles). The ROC also provided military training units for the South Vietnamese diving units. The ROC trained units would eventually become the Lien Doi Nguoi Nhai (LDMN) or Frogman unit in English.

The election took place after the redistricting that resulted from the 1990 Census. Democrats won control of the presidency and both chambers of Congress for the first time since the Republican victory in the 1980 elections. In the presidential election, Democratic Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas defeated Republican incumbent President George H. W. Bush and Texas businessman Ross Perot. Clinton easily won the electoral college with 370 electoral votes, but took just 43 percent of the popular vote, the fourth-lowest share of any victorious presidential candidate. Perot's independent candidacy won the largest share of the popular vote of any third party or independent candidate since Theodore Roosevelt's 1912 candidacy. Clinton defeated former California Governor Jerry Brown and former Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas to take the Democratic nomination. Bush defeated a primary challenge from commentator, and former Reagan White House Director of Communications Pat Buchanan to earn re- nomination as the Republican candidate. A small number of seats changed hands in the Senate, but Democrats retained a comfortable majority. Democrats won the national popular vote for the House of Representatives by a margin of five percentage points, but Republicans won a net gain of nine seats. In the gubernatorial elections, the Democratic Party won a net gain of two states. Issues What was initially viewed as an easy win for the incumbent, George H. W. Bush, turned out quite differently. His famous \\"Read my lips: no new taxes\\" quip was used effectively by his primary challenger Pat Buchanan and later by Governor Bill Clinton. One of the first indicators of Bush's re- election challenge was a poll showing him losing to Texas billionaire Ross Perot in May. Federal elections =Presidential election= Bush had alienated many of the conservatives in his party by breaking his 1988 campaign pledge against raising taxes, but he fended off a primary challenge from conservative commentator Pat Buchanan. Bush's popularity after his success in the Gulf War dissuaded high-profile Democratic candidates like Mario Cuomo from entering the 1992 Democratic primaries. Clinton, a leader of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, established himself as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination by sweeping the Super Tuesday primaries. He defeated former & future Governor of California Jerry Brown, former Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas, and other candidates to win his party's nomination, and chose Senator Al Gore as his running mate. Billionaire Ross Perot launched an independent campaign, emphasizing his opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement and his plan to reduce the national debt. The economy was in recession and Bush's greatest strength, foreign policy, was regarded as much less important following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War and the relatively peaceful climate in the Middle East after the Gulf War. Perot led in several polls taken in June 1992, but severely damaged his candidacy by temporarily dropping out of the race in July. The Bush campaign criticized Clinton's character and emphasized Bush's foreign policy successes, while Clinton focused on the economy. Clinton won a plurality in the popular vote and a majority of the electoral vote, breaking a streak of three straight Republican victories. Clinton swept the Northeastern United States, marking the start of Democratic dominance in the region in presidential elections, while also performing well in the Midwest and the West. Along with Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford, Bush is one of three incumbent presidents since World War II to be defeated in the general election. Perot won 18.9% of the popular vote, the highest share of the vote won by a candidate outside of the two major parties since 1912. Although he failed to win any electoral votes, Perot found support in every state, and Clinton's home state of Arkansas was the lone state to give a majority of its vote to any candidate. =Senate Elections= The 34 Seats in the Senate Class III were up for election. Democratic victories over Republicans John F. Seymour (in the special California race) and Bob Kasten (of Wisconsin) were cancelled out by the defeats of Democrats Wyche Fowler (of Georgia) and Terry Sanford (of North Carolina). The election of four new Democratic women to the Senate was notable (referred to in the press as the \\"Year of the Woman\\"). California became the first state to have elected women to occupy both of its Senate seats due to the victories of Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer. Democrat Carol Moseley Braun (of Illinois), became the first African-American woman in the United States Senate. =House Elections= Though they won the national popular vote for the House of Representatives by a margin of five percentage points, Democrats lost a net of nine seats in the House to the Republicans, in part due to redistricting following the 1990 Census. The redrawn districts were notable for the increase in majority-minority districts, drawn as mandated by the Voting Rights Act. While the redistricting after the 1980 Census had resulted in 17 majority-black districts and 10 majority-Hispanic districts, 32 and 19 such districts, respectively, were drawn after the 1990 Census. State Elections Democrats and Republicans each defended gubernatorial positions in six states in 1992. Democrats won a net gain of two gubernatorial seats in the 1992 elections.

Dom arrived as the brother of established character Toni Thompson (Laura Hill) however soon after arrival, was revealed as the half brother of Chris Warner (Michael Galvin). Initially appearing as a protagonist, Dom soon developed into a much more sinister character who was key to several high-profile storylines. These included his marriage to Emily Bredican (Sarah Somerville), affair with 16-year-old Delphi Greenlaw (Anna Hutchison), a rivalry with Chris Warner after discovering they were not related, murdering Geoff Greenlaw (Andrew Laing), his controversial return on the shows 3000th episode, his murder of Avril Lucich (Kate Louise-Elliott) and a dramatic conclusion episode in December 2004 that saw Dom die after trying to murder Chris. Dom's two- year-long stint saw the show receive huge ratings and the period be remembered as a well done and iconic season. The character remains mentioned and referred to as a menacing and monumental character who brought the show back its excitement. Creation and casting After auditioning for Geoff Greenlaw and losing out to Andrew Laing, Shane Cortese learned producers had created a character specifically for him to be the brother of a major character and it was undecided whether the character would be \\"good or bad\\". Cortese made his debut as Dom in early 2003 under a yearlong contract with the potential of another 12 month expansion. The character stayed on screen for a year and departed in early 2004. Producers offered Cortese the chance to return on the show's 3000th episode under a contract that would see him continue with the show until mid-2005. Cortese accepted and returned to the show on the momentous 3000th episode. The character ended up getting killed off later in the year. Storylines Dom arrived to visit his sister Toni (Laura Hill) and quickly got a job at the hospital. He mysteriously got on well with rival Chris' (Michael Galvin) mother - Margot Warner (Dinah Priestley) and when she died, Dom revealed himself as Chris' illegitimate half brother. Taking up the Warner surname, Dom married Emily (Sarah Somerville) and fought attractions to teenager - Delphi Greenlaw (Anna Hutchison). Following a blood test, Dom realized he was not related to Chris but kept it a secret whilst he started an affair with Delphi. To hide the affair, he drugged his wife and soon became a suspect in the murder of Geoff (Andrew Laing) who had discovered the affair. Once Chris discovered the truth, Dom circulated rumours he was a child molestor. Dom and Delphi planned to run away but Delphi discovered Dom had killed Geoff and a desperate Dom fled Ferndale. Dom returned later in 2004, having started a relationship with Lucy (Sally Stockwell). He managed to successfully avoid capture in relation to Geoff's murder and when Avril (Kate Louise-Elliot) began snooping, he drowned her in his bath tub. When the staff started to turn against Dom after Avril's sister Bernadette (Kate Louise- Elliot) accused him of murder, he faked mental illness and after escaping a psych ward, he lured Chris to a barn and tried to set him on fire. Unsuccessful, Dom ended up getting caught in a large explosion. With intense burns, Dom finally admitted to killing Geoff and Avril before he died in Toni's arms. Character development =Relationship with Delphi Greenlaw= In 2003 Dom underwent a storyline where he fell for his best friends sister, 15-year-old Delphi Greenlaw. Cortese was at first uncomfortable with the storyline, stating; \\"I was very worried about the age difference but the way it's been done and written is really respectful.\\" Cortese also believed despite the age difference, Dom was truly in love with Delphi; \\"Dom sees Delphi as his soul mate, she affects him in a way no one has before because he's always been suspicious of relationships. He doesn't have to pretend to be anyone else for her to like him.\\" Producer Harriet Crampton enjoyed the romance and how it contrasted with Dom's evil character, stating; \\"To have a villain who has a strong sincere love or passion makes you think, ‚ÄòOkay, he‚Äôs an absolute bastard but we know he does love Delphi.\\" The two first get together when Delphi turns 16, sharing a kiss. The two eventually start a relationship but break up when Dom comes under question of Geoff's murder in arguably one of the soap's most memorable storylines. Dom flees when Delphi confronts him about the murder but later returns, with Cortese suggesting it was for love; \\"But the thing about Dominic is he believes he's doing everything for the right reasons. He's done everything he can for Delphi ‚Äî that's his main reason for coming back.\\" Dom later scares Delphi into fleeing the country, ending the once seemingly perfect relationship. Reception Michael Galvin listed the storyline between Chris and Dom as one of the most iconic storylines on the soap. He believed his physical similarity with Cortese made the storyline more believable and captivating. Rebecca Barry Hill of The New Zealand Herald noted the character of Dom as a highlight of the show. The storyline that saw Dom have an affair with 16-year-old Delphi was viewed on as scandalous. His return on the 3000th episode was described as \\"jaw dropping\\". The \\"Who Killed Geoff Greenlaw\\" storyline is remembered as hugely iconic. The characters stint proved to be a ratings success and the episodes which saw Dom return, be kidnapped by Bernadette and his death, proved to be the shows highest rating episodes for the year. Cortese himself however, believed he was \\"awful\\" in the role of Dom but enjoyed it nonetheless. In 2012, the character was named as one of the standout characters of the show's first 20 years. The storyline between Chris and Dom has been voted by fans as one of the most iconic moments on the show.

Brutum. Cicero attempts to explain why his view of oratorical style reflects true Atticism and is better than that of the Roman Atticists \\"who would confine the orator to the simplicity and artlessness of the early Attic orators.\\"Hendrickson, G. L. \\"Cicero De Optimo Genere Oratorum.\\" The American Journal of Philology 47.2 (1926): 109‚Äì23. JSTOR. Web. This short treatise professes to be the introduction to a translation of a speech by Demosthenes called On the Crown, and a speech of his rival, Aeschines, called Against Ctesiphon. Cicero was an advocate of free translation: \\"The essence of successful oratory, he insists, is that it should 'instruct, delight, and move the minds of his audience', this being achievable in translation only by conserving the 'force and flavour of the passage', not by translating 'word for word'.\\"Hubbell, H. M., trans. \\"De Optimo Genere Oratorum.\\" Cicero: De Inventione, De Optimo Genere Oratorum, Topica. London: William Heinemann Ltd, 1969. pp. 349‚Äì72. The actual translation of the two speeches was never published, and De Optimo Genere Oratorum was not published in Cicero's lifetime. Many believe that the final treatise is a compilation of two drafts that Cicero wrote. In his critique of this piece, Hendrickson argues how the \\"brevity of mere jottings and suggestions, to omissions of words (which modern editors have supplied), to suppressed sequences of thought, to evidence of double treatment\\" all give evidence of the uncompleted state of De Optimo Genere Oratorum.Weissbort, Daniel. \\"Classical Latin and Early Christian Latin Translation.\\" Translation: Theory and Practice A Historical Reader. Ed. Eysteinsson Astradur. New York:Oxford UP, USA, 2006. p. 22.  Dispute over placement of the text  Brutus is a work by Cicero that explains the history of Roman oratory, and Orator highlights the basic requirements needed to be the best orator. This is important because it helps scholars best estimate when De Optimo Genere Oratorum was written in accordance with these two texts. Writing De Optimo Genere Oratorum after Brutus allowed Cicero to use the historical information from Brutus to support his own views on stylistic propriety. The Orator then takes the views of De Optimo Genere Oratorum, and develops them into a more conclusive statement of the perfect orator. Summary of the seven parts of De Optimo Genere Oratorum  =Part 1= Cicero starts off talking about different kinds of poets and how every genre of poetry has its own individuality. He then contrasts this to describing different kinds of orators, whom you can distinguish from one another, but ultimately still miss information about the art of oratory. \\"There is only one kind of orator...the one whose speech instructs, delights, and moves the minds of his audience.‚Äù Although there are other great orators, the difference is \\"in degree, not in kind.‚Äù =Part 2= Cicero says that the orator must attend to style, structure, arrangement, memory, and delivery. Using these criteria he develops a way of judging the best orator. =Part 3= Cicero feels that the Attic writers of Athens exemplified such criteria and strove to be better than the best in their oratory. He argues that these are the ones that need to be followed, unlike those practitioners of the Asiatic style ‚Äúwhose opulent style is full of faults; Asia produced this latter sort in abundance.‚Äù =Part 4= Cicero uses the example of Lysias, who was able to abstract his style from his writing and write in the tone of someone else. He then makes a distinction between and addresses two groups, those who think they speak in an Attic manner and those who say no Roman does. To Cicero, the best orators were those who lived in Athens, Demosthenes being the best, so ‚Äúspeaking in the Attic fashion means speaking well.‚Äù =Part 5= To prove his point he explains that he has translated a debate between the two best Attic orators, Aeschines and Demosthenes. =Part 6= He argues that in presenting this translation of a debate, the characteristics of the best orator will be made evident. He also criticizes any objections to his Latin translation of the text. =Part 7= He then presents the case that Aeschines and Demosthenes were debating over. In Athens there were laws against crowning certain citizens and another against when and where to reward someone. In a charitable fashion, Demosthenes repaired the city walls and caught the attention Ctesiphon who wanted him crowned, although this was contrary to the law. Aeschines then brought charges against Ctesiphon stating the laws that had not been followed and questioning the genuine and kind nature of Demosthenes‚Äôs actions. Aeschines himself, however, was using this instance to truly attack Ctesiphon. The charges were brought up during the reign of Philip of Macedon but were not addressed until that of Alexander. All came to hear the two great orators, and Cicero finishes the introduction by stating his sincere intention to reflect the true spirit of the debate.

Early life and education Steve Miller wanted to be a writer from an early age: \\"Actually, when I was in first grade, I wanted to be a sheriff's deputy... Then I wrote a little book in first grade called 'The Man Who Watches' about a sheriff's deputy, and I won some sort of prize for it. From then on, I wanted to be a writer.\\" After Miller graduated from the University of Utah with a degree in English, with a Creative Writing emphasis, he began working as a publicist for a television station, and at the same time freelancing as a feature writer and entertainment critic for various weekly newspapers and magazines. During this time he also unsuccessfully attempted to break into the comic book industry. Career A fellow gamer suggested that Miller try writing role-playing game material, so the next day Miller called Bruce Heard at TSR. Heard, who handled the scheduling of TSR's freelancers at the time, set Miller up with editing and design tests. His first freelance assignment came a few months later. After a few months of freelancing, Tim Brown called Miller and offered him a staff job after Miller wrote him a letter of thanks for providing writing tips: \\"I'd said in the letter, 'if you have any openings, please keep me in mind,' not really thinking anything would come of it.\\" Miller accepted the job, working on the Ravenloft and Dragonlance lines during his time with TSR and later Wizards of the Coast. Bruce Cordell and Miller worked on Die Vecna Die! (2000) together, an original adventure that brought an end to the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons line. Miller co-wrote the first 3rd Edition Forgotten Realms adventure Into the Dragon's Lair with Sean K. Reynolds. Between his stints at TSR and Wizards of the Coast, Miller worked for West End Games on their Star Wars Adventure Journal product line. In late June 2011, Miller began distributing role-playing game material and fiction in digital format under NUELOW Games, with exclusive distribution through OneBookShelf websites.

He was portrayed by Renato Bartolomei for four years from May 2004 to September 2008. The character arrived in mid-2004 as the father of the established character Scarlett (Nicole Thomson), in what was to become a new family unit for the soap. The character embarked in a steamy on/off relationship with the hugely popular Sarah Potts (Amanda Billing) in a romance storyline that lasted four years. The character's final storyline saw Craig investigate dodgy pills from a pharmaceutical company, Scott Spear, which resulted in his murder by hired thugs. His relationships often stemmed from his kind but overly protective personality, with a hugely cemented friendship with Chris Warner (Michael Galvin) and a long running relationship with the feisty Alice Piper (Toni Potter). Creation and casting After filming ended on the series Mercy Peak, Bartolomei decided he would stay in New Zealand rather than returning to Australia and was offered the role of a new character ‚Äì Craig Valentine on Shortland Street, who was set to undergo a steamy romance with the upcoming character Sarah Potts. Bartolomei decided to leave the soap in 2008, saying, \\"It was a very difficult decision, from an actor's point of view it's not very often that you have the security that a job like Shortland Street provides. But after four and a half years I longed for a degree of anonymity again. I'm a very private person, and given what I do for a job, the spectre of Shortland Street will invariably take that away from you.\\" The character was killed off in a dramatic gang storyline, something which producers at first thought would be \\"unforgivable\\" but which, due to Bartolomei's iinsistence on leaving, they went through with. Bartolomei said of the storyline, \\"It's all a bit of fun and it's nice to see the characters away from the normal hospital setting and involved in something a little bit different,\\" and of the conclusion to Sarah and Craig's romance, \\"That does get revisited but not in a stereotypical way. There is a great deal of resolution at the end for everyone concerned.\\" Storylines Craig arrived at the hospital when his best friend, Chris Warner (Michael Galvin), hired him to be run the Emergency Department. Craig at first clashed with Sarah Potts (Amanda Billing) before the two briefly dated. The arrival of Craig's ex-wife, Paula (Vivian Bell) and his brother Brett (Colin Moy), for whom she had left Craig, caused trouble when Brett died and Paula tried to reignite the marriage. Craig kicked Paula out and in 2005 started to date Huia (Nicola Kawana). However, he unsuccessfully tried to persuade Sarah to return to him over fianc√© Andrew (Paolo Rotondo). Craig's anger problems began to destroy his relationship with Huia and when she stood him down for an outburst, he broke it off and returned to Sarah. However, while at a conference, Craig had a one-night stand with, and impregnated, Huia. Sarah broke it off with him and Huia and their child died in an explosion. Craig confessed his love for Sarah only to lose out on her to Huia's cousin TK (Benjamin Mitchell). In 2007, Craig started to date Alice Piper (Toni Potter) and tried to stop Sarah marrying TK, but ended up escorting Sarah to the ceremony himself. Craig suffered a huge heart attack at the wedding party and was infuriated by Alice treating him like a patient. In 2008, Craig was devastated when he nearly lost Alice to The Ferndale Strangler and helped her through her post-traumatic stress before he proposed. Alice became pregnant but Craig broke it off when he realised she had cheated on him. He was devastated to learn how badly bullied his daughter Scarlett (Nicole Thomson) was and left Shortland Street for a position at pharmaceutical company, Scott Spear, where he hoped he could expose their illegal activities. However, shortly after discovering sufficient evidence, Craig was run off the road, beaten and set alight by hired thugs. A memorial service was held days later, where Sarah sang a song highlighting Craig's personality. With Craig's evidence, Scott Spear was shut down in 2009. Reception The character was labelled a \\"heart throb\\", severely embarrassing Bartolomei. Potter jokingly referred to women expressing their jealousy over her onscreen boyfriend. The actor received a nomination for \\"Best Actor\\" for his work throughout 2008 in the New Zealand TV Guide Best on the Boox Awards. In 2012, the character was named as one of the outstanding characters of the show's first 20 years. Following Craig's gruesome and violent death scene, which saw the character beaten with a baseball bat then set alight, Shortland Street received its second warning from the Broadcasting Standards Authority following several complaints. The warning was given because \\"The theme was likely to frighten and disturb child viewers, particularly because the violence ‚Äì which included easily accessible weapons such as baseball bats ‚Äì was realistic in the sense that it could happen in New Zealand.\\" References Category:Shortland Street characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2004 Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Craig Valentine"},{"id":"27043673","text":"Blue Beach Military Cemetery at San Carlos is a British war cemetery in the Falkland Islands holding the remains of 13 of the 255 British casualties killed during the Falklands War in 1982, and one other killed in early 1984. It is situated close to where 3 Commando Brigade had its initial headquarters after landing on 21 May 1982. Up until 1982 all British serviceman killed in action were buried and commemorated as close to the place of death as possible and the Commonwealth War Graves Commission managed these graves.Corners of a foreign field ‚Äì The Telegraph. Retrieved April 2010. After the Falklands War, one family requested the repatriation of their fallen son's body and, following this, other families requested the same; as a result, this offer was extended to all relatives. On 16 November 1982 64 of the dead (52 soldiers, 11 Royal Marines, and one laundryman from Hong Kong) were returned to Britain aboard the landing ship Sir Bedivere. The families of 15 of the dead kept with tradition and preferred their sons' remains should stay in the islands. Thirteen are buried at Port San Carlos with two more at isolated single grave sites at Goose Green and Port Howard. The fourteenth person interred at Port San Carlos is Captain John Belt of the Army Air Corps, who died in a helicopter crash in January 1984. Design In 1982, at the request of the Ministry of Defence, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission undertook the design and construction of a cemetery and memorial. The plans were approved by the MOD on 12 November 1982 at a total cost of ¬£50,000. The work was completed with the assistance of 8 Field Squadron Royal Engineers and the Brigade of Gurkhas and dedicated on 10 April 1983. The headstones are of Orton Scar limestone and the memorial panels are of light sea green slate from Cumbria. The cemetery is surrounded by a 3 feet (1 metre) high wall with a small entrance open to the beach in the style of a stone sheep corral. Opposite the entrance, the wall is tapered higher with seven slate panels, six with the Regiment, Name, Rank and Service of the fallen and one with the three Forces' Emblems and the following inscription; Cemetery Inscription The site is divided into two sections each with seven graves. The section on the right is known as the Airborne Cemetery as it contains the remains of four Paratroopers including that of Lieutenant-Colonel \\"H\\" Jones. Alongside them are two Royal Signallers from 5th Infantry Brigade Headquarters and Sergeant Griffin from 656 Squadron Army Air Corps who were all killed in the Gazelle friendly fire incident. Directly opposite are another seven headstones laid out in the same pattern with the remains of six Royal Marines and that of Captain Belt. Nearby is the San Carlos museum, with photographs and relics from the conflict. On 21 May 2002, the 20th anniversary of the landings, a service of remembrance was held at the cemetery. Over 300 islanders and personnel from the garrison joined the Falklands Governor, in remembering those who lost their lives in the campaign. Ahead of this ceremony, the cemetery landscaping around the graves was overhauled and refreshed through the installation of timber boards, gravel infill and planting. This works was organised through and carried out by contracting organisations employed at the Mount Pleasant military base. ;National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire On 20 May 2012, a duplicate of the San Carlos Memorial was dedicated at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire England. The official dedication, which was attended by The Band of Her Majesty's Royal Marines also marked the 30th anniversary of the landings. Speaking at the ceremony, the widow of Lieutenant-Colonel H Jones', Sara, described the memorial as a \\"Fitting tribute to the members of the Task Force who gave their lives\\".The Press Association Falklands War memorial unveiled Breakdown of the casualties A total of 255 British servicemen and 3 female Falkland Island civilians were killed during the Falklands War.According to * Royal Navy ‚Äì 86 + 2 Hong Kong laundrymen * Royal Marines ‚Äì 27 (2 officers, 14 NCOs and 11 marines) * Royal Fleet Auxiliary ‚Äì 4 + 4 Hong Kong laundrymen * Merchant Navy ‚Äì 6 + 2 Hong Kong sailors * British Army ‚Äì 123 (7 officers, 40 NCOs and 76 privates) * Royal Air Force ‚Äì 1 (1 officer) * Falkland Islands civilians ‚Äì 3 women killed by British shelling. 174 were buried at sea, or lost with their aircraft/ships and their remains not recovered.

It did not reair the night of November 23, 2009 due to a Family Guy rerun. Paid Programming is a parody of infomercials and was created and written by H. Jon Benjamin and David Cross, and features amateur actors from Central Casting. Although the pilot was never picked up for a full series, it received a positive reception in London when screened at monthly comedy event called \\"Popcorn Comedy night\\". Adult Swim continues to periodically rebroadcast the pilot episode. Production Paid Programming was created and written by H. Jon Benjamin and David Cross, and directed by Jeff Buchanan. The pilot episode was first announced at Dragon*Con 2009 in September 2009, where it was described as an \\"infomercial within an infomercial\\"; no other information was revealed at that time. Although Benjamin and Cross make voice cameos in the pilot, the cast of Paid Programming consists mainly of \\"non-recognizable\\" amateur actors from Central Casting. The pilot does not feature any credits or production cards, and ended with a cliffhanger. In a 2010 interview David Cross mentioned it was their intent to make Paid Programming as similar to a real infomercial as possible, in order to trick unsuspecting viewers into thinking it's a real infomercial; and was upset that the project was announced at Dragon*Con. According to Benjamin and Cross, Adult Swim was only \\"semi-committed\\" to the project, and was worried that it would do poorly ratings wise. Paid Programming was not picked up as a full series, as revealed when Benjamin referred to it as an \\"abject failure\\". Despite the pilot failing, the network greenlit more fake infomercials in 2012. Broadcast history Similar to the broadcast history of The Rising Son, another program on Adult Swim, the pilot episode of Paid Programming was aired in the United States on the night of November 2, 2009 at 4:30 am (ET), unannounced and unadvertised, and was listed as \\"SPECIAL\\" on the Adult Swim schedule. After its original debut, Adult Swim then re-aired the pilot every Monday through Friday night until December 4, 2009, with the exception of November 23, 2009 which saw a Family Guy rerun take its time slot.

Then he steps in a bucket of water and the colors wash off, and they became wet, but still never loses his cool, he just sings his song. The book was self-published in 2008 and sold 7,000 copies in 10 months before it was picked up by HarperCollins ‚Äì alerted by a YouTube meme in which two little girls read the book ‚Äì and distributed throughout the United States and Canada.

It was established in 1973 by the Edmonds-South Snohomish County Historical Society. It is located in downtown Edmonds at 118 5th Ave. North. Displays The museum building has two floors. The upper floor features an exhibit gallery which offers temporary rotating displays, a diorama depicting the 1910 Edmonds town site and waterfront, and the Cook Victorian Parlor. The upper level also houses the administrative office, work rooms, a local history library and an extensive photography archive. The public is encouraged to use the research library, with an advance appointment. The ground floor consists of the long-term exhibit conceived to commemorate the centennial of the incorporation of the City of Edmonds (1890/1990). \\"The Changing Face of Edmonds\\" is an encapsulated, thematic, and chronological history exhibit, interpreting the many changes that have taken place, from the age of exploration and discovery, through the founding and growth of the city, and up to the 1950s when the last mill closed. Highlights of the exhibit include a reconstruction of a room from the 1894 Stevens Hotel, and a working model of a shingle mill, representative of the mills that filled the waterfront at the turn of the century. Events and community outreach Most visitors to the museum come in the form of local travelers and school groups. To further accommodate school groups and education, the museum has also created \\"Trunk Tales for the Classroom\\" which are sent to schools to provide a hands-on, interactive approach to learning about the city's history. In addition to providing the Trunk Tales, The Edmonds Historical Museum hosts and participates in several local community events including the Edmonds Historical Walk and the Edmonds Museum Garden Market (summers).

Setting The book is set in southeastern Ontario, Canada in 1966. Much of the story takes place in the form of reminiscences of the late 1940s and 1950s. Story Narrator Matt Goderich, now approaching middle age, has become an art historian. As the novel opens, he is wandering along the back roads of eastern Ontario, contemplating the flora, the history of trains in the region, and decades past. He relates his time as a young student, beginning in 1948, where he is a rare Catholic at the overwhelmingly Protestant Victoria University in the University of Toronto. After a fleeting first romance he meets his future wife Edie, who disappoints her family by converting to Catholicism to marry him. The young couple spends time in her hometown of Stoverville (a fictionalized version of Brockville), where her parents have a boathouse on the Saint Lawrence River. Her father is a well-known politician, and her mother is a brilliant but undiscovered painter. The 'new Athens' of the title is a reference to the town of Athens, Ontario.

Brown. They made specially branded versions of Internet Explorer for various company brands and themes. Because the branded web browsers made by MediaBrowser require Internet Explorer 5 or higher it is only supported on Windows operating systems. On December 5, 2001, Mediabrowser.com, Inc. went bankrupt and shut down their site and its branded web browsers.  System requirements  Windows 95 to Windows XP, Internet Explorer 5.0 or higher, Windows Media Player 6.4 or higher, Macromedia Flash 4.0 or higher. Also a 486 MHz or higher processor, 32 MB of RAM, 5 MB of free hard drive space, and an active Internet connection. Due to compatibility issues, MediaBrowser is not compatible with Windows Vista or Windows 7; however it can be run under Windows XP Compatibility Mode.  Browser registration  Upon new installation of a MediaBrowser branded browser the user was required to register their web browser using MediaBrowser's online registration form that asked for their name, address, etc. if they were over 12 years old. When MediaBrowser was shut down the registration process was broken (as the registration form was hosted on their now defunct web site) therefore users would not be able to use it unless they modified a value in Windows Registry.  Branding  The branding consisted of various brand images on the background, navigation buttons, splash screen and links to specific web pages that related to the brand of the company. MediaBrower also had a space for ads to display at the bottom of the web browser. MediaBrowser's MicroTron was also included in every MediaBrowser branding to display brand-related video content to the user.  Nintendo and MediaBrowser  Pok√©mon GS Branded MediaBrowser In late 2000, video game company Nintendo partnered with MediaBrowser to make branded browsers of their new and upcoming video games. The first two browsers to be released were for the (then upcoming) Pok√©mon Gold and Silver video games and Mario Tennis. Retailers gave out CD-ROM copies of the branded Pok√©mon GS browser to anyone who pre-ordered a copy of Pok√©mon Gold or Silver as a special promotion. Later in 2001, other browsers were released branded with other Nintendo games such as Paper Mario and Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. A Nintendo Power branded browser was released as well.  Bankruptcy  MediaBrowser.com, Inc. went bankrupt on December 5, 2001 under Chapter 7 filing due to company debts of $2.49 million and various unpaid loans. The web site containing all the branded web browsers was pulled and Nintendo posted a notice on their downloads page stating \\"Nintendo's custom browsers are currently unavailable.

Currently, this note is issued by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC), Standard Chartered Hong Kong, and the Bank of China. Due to its gold-colored theme, this note was nicknamed ‚ÄúGold Cow (Chinese: ÈáëÁâõ)‚Äù by the locals, derived from the term ‚ÄúBig Cow (Chinese: Â§ßÁâõ)‚Äù that is used for the city's five hundred-dollar note. If counted according to the notes‚Äô serial number, it is the note with the second-lowest printing figure, higher than that of the fifty-dollar note. History Proof issues were made by the Oriental Bank Corporation and the Bank of Hindustan, China and Japan during the 1860s. However, due to the low price level in that era, those notes are currently extremely rare. It was not until 31 March 1977 that the first circulating note was issued by the HSBC with a dimension of 100mm by 173mm. Later in 6 March 1979, the Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) issued its own one thousand-dollar note, with a dimension of 100mm by 170mm. Since 1985, the note issued by both banks were redesigned with a shrunk size of 81.5mm by 163mm. In 1988, a lighter shade of gold was used by the HSBC as the previous selection of colour was overly dark. The same change could also be seen on the twenty-dollar note and the one hundred-dollar note of HSBC during this decade. As the date of the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong was approaching, the two note-issuing banks modified their design in 1993 to tune down the British elements. In 1994, the Bank of China became the third note-issuing bank in the territory. Changes of design were made in the year 2003, 2010 and subsequently in 2018 to add in new security features.

Considered a subdivision of neuroscience, paleoneurobiology combines techniques from other fields of study including paleontology and archaeology. It reveals specific insight concerning human evolution. The cranium is unique in that it grows in response to the growth of brain tissue rather than genetic guidance, as is the case with bones that support movement. Fossil skulls and their endocasts can be compared to each other, to the skulls and fossils of recently deceased individuals, and even compared to those of other species to make inferences about functional anatomy, physiology and phylogeny. Paleoneurobiology is in large part influenced by developments in neuroscience as a whole; without substantial knowledge about current functionality, it would be impossible to make inferences about the functionality of ancient brains. Hominid paleoneurobiology refers specifically to the study of brain evolution by directly examining the fossil record of humans and their closest hominid relatives (defined as species more closely related to humans than chimpanzees). Paleoneurobiologists analyze endocasts that reproduce details of the external morphology of brains that have been imprinted on the internal surfaces of skulls. History Primate skull seriesHumans have had a long interest in the brain and its functions. The first recorded study of the brain and its functions was from a papyrus text written by the ancient Egyptians during the 17th century BCE. The document details 48 medical ailments and makes references to how to deal with head wounds. Much later in the 6th century BCE the ancient Greeks began to focus on studies of the brain and the relationship between the optic nerve and the brain. Studies of brain evolution, however, did not come about until much later in human history. Comparative anatomy began its emergence in the latter part of the 19th century. Two main views of life sprung forth; rationalism and transcendentalism. These formed the basis for the thought of scientists in this period. Georges Cuvier and √âtienne Geoffroy St. Hilaire were leaders in the new field of comparative anatomy. Cuvier believed in the ability to create a functional morphology based simply on empirical evidence. He stressed function of the organ must coincide with its form. Geoffroy, in contrast, put a heavy emphasis on intuition as a method of understanding. His thought was based on two principles: the principle of connections and the principle of unity of plan. Geoffroy was one of the first to look for homologies in organs across species, though he believed that this was evidence of a universal plan rather than descent with modification. The late part of the 19th century in comparative anatomy was heavily influenced by the work of Charles Darwin in the On the Origin of Species in 1859. This work completely changed the views of comparative anatomists. Within 8 years of Darwin's release of the Origin of Species, his views on descent from a common ancestor were widely accepted. This led to a shift in trying to understand how different parts of the brain evolved. The next major innovation that helped to bring about paleoneurobiology was the microscope. Although the microscope was invented in the 17th century, it was only used in biology in the beginning in the late 19th century. The techniques of observing brain cells under a microscope took a long time to refine. In 1873, with this tool in hand, Camillo Golgi began to cellularly detail the brain and employ techniques to perfect axonal microscoping. Ludwig Edinger took advantage of this and came up with a new branch of anatomy called comparative neuroanatomy. Edinger held that vertebrates evolved in a linear progressive series. He also thought that changes in the brain were based on a series of additions and differentiations and that the most highly, complex brains were those that were the most encephalized. The period of 1885-1935 was an explosion of ideas in comparative neuroanatomy. This era culminated in the publication of \\"The Comparative Anatomy of the Nervous System\\" by Arienns, Kappers, Huber, and Cosby. This paper influenced Tilly Edinger and she later became the founder of Paleoneurobiology. =Tilly Edinger= Ottilie \\"Tilly\\" Edinger was born in Frankfurt, Germany in 1897. Her father Ludwig Edinger, himself a pioneer in comparative neurology, provided Tilly with invaluable exposure to his field and the scientific community at large. Tilly had many private tutors before attending Schiller-Schule, the only secondary school for girls in Frankfurt at that time. Tilly Edinger continued her schooling with university studies in zoology, geology, and paleontology. While preparing her doctoral dissertation, Edinger encountered a natural brain endocast of Nothosaurus, a marine reptile from the Mesozoic era. Edinger's first paper, published in 1921, centered on the characteristics of the Nothosaurus specimen. Prior to the publication of her work, inferences about the evolution of the vertebrate brain were made exclusively through comparative anatomy of extant fish, amphibian, reptile, bird, and mammal brains. Tilly Edinger's background in neurology and paleontology paved the way for her to integrate comparative anatomy and stratigraphic sequence, thus introducing the concept of time to neurology and creating the field of paleoneurobiology. The field was formally defined with the publication of Die fossilen Gehirne (Fossil Brains) in 1929 which compiled knowledge on the subject that had previously been scattered in a wide variety of journals and treated as isolated events. While still in Germany, Edinger began studying extant species from a paleoneurobiological perspective by making inferences about evolutionary brain development in seacows using stratigraphic and comparative anatomical evidence. Edinger continued her research in Nazi Germany until the night of November 9, 1938 when thousands of Jews were killed or imprisoned in what became known as Kristallnacht. Although a visa was not immediately available for immigration to the United States, with the help of friends and colleagues who valued her work, Edinger was able to immigrate to London where she translated German medical texts into English. Eventually her visa quota number was called and she was able to immigrate to the United States where she took on a position as a research fellow at Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology. Her contributions to the field of paleoneurobiology include determining the extent to which endocasts reflect the anatomy of ancient brains, the adequacy of comparative anatomy to interpret brain evolution, the ability of brain endocasts to predict the lifestyles of extinct organisms, and if brain size has increased over geological time; topics which are still being explored today. In her later years, Edinger corresponded with the next generation of paleoneurobiologists, which insured that the work from her 50-year career continued into the future. The pinnacle accomplishment of her career was the compilation of an annotated bibliography of paleoneurobiological papers published between 1804 and 1966. The bibliography, Paleoneurology 1804-1966, was completed and published by colleagues posthumously in 1975 due to the untimely death of Edinger from injuries sustained during a traffic accident in 1967. =Conflict between Holloway and Falk= Paleoneurobiologists Ralph L. Holloway and Dean Falk disagree about the interpretation of a depression on the Australopithecus afarensis AL 162-28 endocast. Holloway argues that the depression is a result of lipping at the lambdoid suture and that the sulcal patterns indicate cerebral organization moving toward a more human pattern, while Falk insists that the depression is the lunate sulcus in a position that is indicative of an ape-like sulcal pattern. The debate between these two scientists is not hinged solely on the AL 162-28 endocast, but rather extends to all australopithecine fossils, with Holloway insisting on the presence of hominid sulcal features, and Falk maintaining that the features are pongid in nature. The debate between Holloway and Falk is so intense that between 1983 and 1985, they published four papers on the identification of the medial end of the lunate sulcus of the Taung endocast (Australopithecus africanus), which only further strengthened the division between each scientist's respective opinion. Although there have been no definitive conclusions about the fossils in question, many techniques were created or critically analyzed and refined as a result of the conflict. These new techniques in endocast analysis included the use of stereoplotting to transfer sulci between differently shaped endocasts, measurement of indexes from photographs rather than directly from specimens, and confounding of measurements taken directly from specimens and those taken from photographs. Brain endocasts Normal human brain CT scanA brain endocast is the imprintation of the inner features of a cranium that captures the details created from pressure exerted on the skull by the brain itself. Endocasts can be formed naturally by sedimentation through the cranial foramina which becomes rock-hard due to calcium deposition over time, or artificially by creating a mold from silicon or latex that is then filled with plaster-of-Paris while sitting in a water bath to equalize forces and retain the original shape. Natural endocasts are very rare; most of those that are studied are the result of artificial methods. Although the name implies that it is a copy of the once living brain, endocasts rarely exhibit convolutions due to buffering by the pia mater, arachnoid mater, and dura mater that once surrounded and protected the brain tissue. Furthermore, not all endocasts are created from a complete cranial fossil and subsequently, the missing parts are approximated based on similar fossils. In some cases, fragments from several fossils of the same species are used to construct a single endocast. More recently, computed tomography has played a large role in reconstructing endocasts. The procedure is non-invasive and has the advantage of being able to analyze a fossil in record time with little risk of damaging the fossil under review. CT imaging is achieved through the application of x-rays to produce tomographs, or sectional density images, which are similar to the images produced during MRI scans. CT scans use slices approximately 1 mm thick to reconstruct a virtual model of the specimen. This method is especially useful when a fossil cranium is occupied by a natural endocast that cannot be removed without destroying the skeletal portions of the fossil. Because the cranium and its contents are of different densities, the endocranial cavity and its unique traits can be reconstructed virtually. Radiographic technique such as computed tomographic imaging, or CT scans, coupled with computer programming have been used to analyze brain endocasts from as early as 1906. Recent development of advanced computer graphics technology have allowed scientists to more accurately analyze of brain endocasts. M. Vannier and G. Conroy of Washington University School of Medicine have developed a system that images and analyzes surface morphologies in 3D. Scientists are able to encode surface landmarks that allows them to analyze sulcal length, cortical asymmetries and volume. Radiologist, paleoanthropologists, computer scientists in both the United States and Europe have collaborated to study such fossils using virtual techniques. Methods of research Sagittal view of a human brain through MRIPaleoneurobiology revolves around the analysis of endocasts. Much of this analysis is focused on interpreting sulcal patterns, which is difficult because traces are often hardly recognizable, and there are no clear landmarks to use as reference points. Furthermore, the only clear reference plane is the sagittal plane one, which is marked by distinct cerebral asymmetries. Since the obtaining of clear data from fossil details is usually very difficult, much debate arises over interpretations. Experience is often an important factor in endocast analysis. Therefore, a large portion of the field of paleoneurobiology arises out of developing more detailed procedures that increase the resolution and the reliability of interpretations. =Overall brain volume= Statistical analysis of brain endocasts gives information on the increases in overall brain volume (\\"endocranial volume\\"). Because endocasts are not exact replicas, or exact casts, of a once-living brain, computer algorithms and CT scans are needed to calculate endocranial volume. The calculated endocranial volume includes the meninges, cerebrospinal fluid, and cranial nerves. Therefore, these volumes end up larger than the once-living brain. This information is useful for calculating relative brain size, RBS, and encephalization quotient, EQ. The corresponding body weight of the subject must also be known to calculated RBS. RBS is calculated by dividing the weight of the brain by body weight. EQ can be determined several different ways depending on the data set used. For example, Holloway and Post calculate EQ by the following equation: :EQ = \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{Brain weight}}{\\\\operatorname{0.12}\\\\cdot\\\\operatorname{Body weight}^{0.66}} Brain volume is prominent in the scientific literature for discussing taxonomic identification, behavioral complexity, intelligence, and dissimilar rates of evolution. In modern humans, cranial capacity can vary by as much as 1000 cc, without any correlation to behavior. This degree of variation is almost equivalent to the total increase in volume from australopithecine fossils to modern humans, and brings into question the validity of relying on cranial capacity as a measurement of sophistication. Many paleoneurobiologists measure cranial capacity via the submersion method, in which displacement of water in a beaker is taken as the volume of the endocast. Scientists who believe that this method is not accurate enough will use a similar procedure in which a beaker with a spout is filled until it is full. The water displaced by the endocast is then weighed to determine the endocast volume. Although both of these techniques are significantly more precise than previous methods, scientists are optimistic that more advanced techniques such as computed tomography will provide greater accuracy of volume measurements. =Morphometric analysis= Morphometric analysis relies on chord and arc measurements of the endocast surface. Length, width, bregma-basion, and height measurements of an endocast are taken with spreading calipers. Frontal lobe, parietal lobe, and occipital lobe chord length (the length of the lobe at its widest point along the midsagittal plane) are measured using a dioptograph in which landmarks are projected onto a two-dimensional surface. Measurements may be skewed if the orientation of the endocast has not been properly determined before the dioptograph is made. Geometric morphometrics (systems of coordinates superimposed over the measurements of the endocast) are often applied to allow comparison between specimens of varying size. Measurements may also be taken in reference to Broca's area, height of the endocast at 25% intervals of the maximum length, and the vault module (mean of maximum length, width, and middle height). Although other measurements may be taken, the choice of landmarks are not always consistent between studies. =Convolution pattern and cerebral organization= Convolutions, the individual gyri and sulci that compose the folds of the brain, are the most difficult aspect of an endocast to accurately assess. The surface of the brain is often referred to as smooth and fuzzy, due to the meninges and vasculature that cover the brain's surface. It is possible to observe underlying gyri and sulci patterns if an endocast is accurately or preserved, but the uncertainty associated with these patterns often leads to controversy. Because the robust australopithecine fossils show these details, convolutions are included in the study of endocasts whenever appropriate. =Asymmetry= The degree of asymmetry between right and left hemispheres is a point of interest to most paleoneurobiologists because it could be linked to handedness or language development of the specimen. Asymmetries occur due to hemispherical specialization and are observed in both a qualitative and quantitative manner. The unevenness of the hemispheres, known as a petalia, is characterized by a lobe that is wider and/or protruding beyond the contralateral lobe. For example, a right-handed person typically has larger left occipital lobe and right frontal lobes than the contralateral lobes. Petalias also occur due to specialization in the communication centers of the frontal cortex of the brain in modern humans. Petalias in the occipital lobe are easier to detect than those in the frontal lobe. Certain asymmetries have been documented on Homo erectus specimens such as the Homo redolfensis specimen from 1.8 million years ago that resemble the same asymmetries from modern humans. Some gorillas have shown strong petalias, but they are not found in combination with other petalias as is almost always the case in humans. Scientists use the presence of petalias to show sophistication, but they are not a definitive indicator of evolution toward a more human brain. =Meningeal patterns= Although the meninges have no link to behavior, they are still studied within the realm of paleoneurobiology due to the high degree of conservation of meningeal patterns within a species which may serve as a way to determine taxonomy and phylogeny. =Endocranial vasculature= Because meningeal blood vessels comprise part of the outermost layer of the brain, they often leave vascular grooves in the cranial cavity that are captured in endocasts. Endocranial vasculature originates around the foramina in the skull and in a living body would supply blood to the calvaria and dura mater. The vasculature is so well preserved in some fossils that terminal branches of the circulatory system can be observed. Analysis of cranial vasculature concentrates on the anterior meningeal system of the frontal region, the middle meningeal system of the parieto-temporal and part of the anterior occipital region, and the cerebellar fossa system of the cerebellar region. In the course of hominid evolution, the middle meningeal system has undergone the most change. Although cranial vasculature has been exhaustively studied in the last century, there has been no consensus on an identification scheme for the branches and patterns of the vascular system resulting from little overlap of results between studies. As such, endocranial vasculature is better suited for inferring the amount of blood delivered to different parts of the brain. =Relative lobe size= It is impossible to determine accurate location of the central or precentral sulci from an endocast. Still it can provide a rough idea of lobe sizes. Significance The study of paleoneurobiology allows researchers to examine the evolutionary nature of human encephalization. Traditionally, paleoneurobiologists have focused on determining the volume of the ancient brain and the patterns that emerged among related species. By finding these measurements, researchers have been able to predict the average body weight of species. Endocasts also reveal traits of the ancient brain including relative lobe size, blood supply, and other general insight into the anatomy of evolving species. Limitations While paleoneurology is useful in the study of brain evolution, certain limitations to the information this study provides do exist. The limited scale and completeness of the fossil record inhibits the ability of paleoneurobiology to accurately document the course of brain evolution. Further, fossil preservation is necessary to ensure accuracy of the endocasts studied. Weathering, erosion, and overall gradual disfiguration may alter the naturally recovered endocasts or endocasts created from existing fossils. The morphology of the brain can also be difficult to both quanitfy and describe, further complicating the observations made from the study of endocasts. Additionally, paleoneurobiology provides very little insight into the actual anatomy within the brains of species studied; the study of endocasts is limited to the external anatomy only. The relationship among endocranial traits remains elusive. Comparative paleoeneurology reveals mostly only differences in endocranial size among related species, such as Gorilla gorilla. Since there is no proven direct relationship between brain size and intelligence, only inferences can be made regarding the developing behavior of ancient relatives of the genus Homo. These limitations of paleoneurobiology are currently being dealt with by the development of more advanced tools to refine the study of endocasts. Studies of interest =Brain shape, intelligence, and cognitive performance= Recent studies by Emiliano Bruner, Manuel Martin-Loechesb, Miguel Burgaletac, and Roberto Colomc have investigated the connection between midsagittal brain shape and mental speed. This study incorporated human subjects' cognitive testing in relationship to extinct humans. They used 2D from 102 MRI-scanned young adult human for comparison. Such correlations are small, suggesting that the influence of midsagittal brain geometry on individual cognitive performance is negligible but still provides useful information of evolutionary traits of the brain. Areas associated with the parietal cortex appear to be involved in relationships between brain geometry and mental speed. =Degenerative diseases and functional disorder= Scientist J. Ghika believes use of paleoneurobiology is the best way to analyze several neurodegeneration leading to diseases such as Parkinson's disease, dyskinesias, gait disorders, Paget's disease of bone, dysautonomia and so on. A past study by S.I. Rapoport on Alzheimer's disease in Homo sapiens has shown the importance in using a darwinian perspective to better understand this disease itself and its symptoms. The aim is to determine the genetic mechanisms that lead to focal or asymmetrical brain atrophy resulting in syndromic presentations that affect gait, hand movements (any sort of locomotion), language, cognition, mood and behavior disorders.

It has papery bark, sharply pointed, twisted leaves and rather long spikes of creamy white flowers in summer.Ravensthorpe fruit Description Melaleuca strobophylla is large shrub or small, spreading tree which grows to a height of with a bushy crown and white, papery bark. The leaves are arranged alternately, long, wide, flat but twisted, narrow elliptic in shape and taper to a sharp point. The creamy- white flowers are arranged in spikes at the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering and sometimes also in the upper leaf axils. The spikes are up to in diameter and contain 8 to 23 pairs of flowers. The outer surface of the flower cup (the hypanthium) is hairy and the five petals surrounding it are long and fall off as the flower matures. The stamens are arranged in bundles of five around the flower, with 16 to 27 stamens in each bundle. The flowers appear between January and April and also in November and are followed by fruit which are woody capsules long, mostly scattered along the branches. Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca strobophylla was first formally described in 1988 by Bryan Barlow in Australian Systematic Botany from a specimen located near Ravensthorpe. The specific epithet (strobophylla) is from the Ancient Greek words strobos meaning \\"twisting\\" or \\"turning\\" and phyllon meaning ‚Äúleaf‚Äù referring to the twist in the leaves. Distribution and habitat This melaleuca occurs in and between the Eneabba, Three Springs and Yalgoo districts. It is found on sandy silt soils in depressions, watercourses and the margins of salt lakes. Conservation Melaleuca strobophylla is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife.

The chapel, designed by Father Joseph Michaud, was built in 1858 as St. Andrew's Cathedral was moved in 1886 to be St. Ann's Chapel and is the oldest part of the Academy. http://stannsacademy.com/HistoryResearch/Places/Chapel.aspx Later a convent was added (1887) to the west side of the Academy and behind the Academy (1910). St. Ann‚Äôs Academy was a girls Catholic boarding and day school from grade 3-12 (K - 3 was in a separate building) and boys K - 3, as well as serving as the Provincial House, convent and novitiate. The Academy was never an Indian Residential school. During its 115 year history, the school welcomed students of all faiths from around the world including Holland, El Salvador, England, Scotland, China, Czechoslovakia, Germany, France, Mexico, Iceland, Japan, Italy and Poland. Students also came from all over Canada and the United States. The Sisters of St. Ann closed the Academy and in 1973 sold the property to the provincial government of British Columbia which used it as office space for the public service for a few years, but it was in need of major repairs and had to be closed. Years-long civic debate of diverse proposals for the future of the building and site ensued. Placed under the stewardship of the Provincial Capital Commission, the interior of the building was gutted and rebuilt, basement to attic, providing seismic upgrade and rehabilitation into modern office space. Once completed, the majority of the building was leased to the BC Ministry of Advanced Education, a use consistent with the Sisters' aims. The exterior facade of his heritage building was retained and repaired. The chapel, parlours and infirmary were retained as an interpretive centre and restored to their 1920s decor. The auditorium at the other end of the building was also seismically upgraded and restored and is used for public lectures and concerts. The building was re-opened in 1997. The chapel was deconsecrated when the Sisters sold the property. Since the restoration of the chapel and the adjacent Novitiate Garden, these have been in great demand as a venue for weddings and other functions. An annex behind the main building which had been occupied by the Victoria Conservatory of Music was demolished on September 11, 2001 following the Conservatory's move to the former Metropolitan United Church buildings.

He was also a teacher at the Mount Carroll Seminary, which later became Shimer College; he was the husband of the seminary's founder, Frances Shimer. Biography =Early life= Shimer was born on September 21, 1828, in West Vincent Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania. He worked as a stone mason in his youth and took up teaching at the age of 18. In March 1854, Shimer left Pennsylvania and traveled west to Mount Carroll, Illinois after a failed love affair. He may have done work on the construction or expansion of the Mount Carroll Seminary, for which the owners were unable to pay him. =Marriage= On December 22, 1857, Shimer and Frances Ann Wood, the co-principal of the Mount Carroll Seminary, were married. Their union was widely reputed to be a marriage of convenience. =Vocations= Shimer subsequently left for Chicago to study medicine. He graduated from the Chicago Medical College on March 1, 1866. Shimer also obtained a Master of Arts from the University of Chicago by examination. He was a prolific entomologist and published widely, describing a number of novel species and genera. He also served for a time as the assistant State Entomologist of Illinois. In addition, he was an expert taxidermist, and had a collection of over 1000 mounted birds. His collections were provided to the seminary for educational purposes. In the 1880s, Shimer became wealthy by speculating on real estate in Iowa, allegedly inspired by a dream. At the time of his death his estate was worth approximately $200,000. =Travels= Shimer traveled widely within the United States, stopping along the way to work as a stone mason. He sometimes covered more than a thousand miles on foot. He is said to have worn boots at all times. =Death= On July 28, 1895, Henry Shimer committed suicide, either with a revolver or by hanging. He had amended his will five days previously to leave his entire fortune to his wife, leaving his mother and sister destitute. In a highly publicized trial, the will was successfully contested.

He also played in the minor leagues until 1925 for the Kansas City Blues, Toronto Maple Leafs, Hartford Senators, Portland Beavers and Wichita Falls Spudders. He was listed during his playing career as 6' 1\\" and 165 pounds. He began his professional career in 1916 at the age of 22 and played for nine seasons, until the age of 31 in 1925. He split his career between the major leagues and the minors, spending four full seasons and a part of a fifth at the former level. In the minors, he spent two full seasons at the Double-A level, parts of two seasons at the Double-A level and part of one season at the Single-A level. Based on the record that is available, it is known that he pitched in 106 minor league games, going 36‚Äì36 with a 3.70 ERA in 656 innings. He also had 241 at bats, hitting .212 with four doubles. He played in the major leagues from 1919 to 1923, appearing in 110 games and going 13‚Äì24 with a 5.04 ERA in 405 innings. He allowed 510 hits and 164 walks, while striking out 94 batters. He was used both as a relief pitcher and a starting pitcher, finishing in the top 10 on the National League leader board in games finished and saves multiple times. As a batter, he hit .171 in 117 at bats and in the field, he committed 10 errors for a .929 fielding percentage. He was also involved in six double plays. He was a highly touted young player at the onset of his career, being initially compared to Hall of Fame pitcher Christy Mathewson and eventually former 21-game winner Ferdie Schupp. According to contemporary accounts of the time, his assets were many-fold: \\"He has every physical qualification\\", stated the New York Tribune, \\"as well as a varied assortment in the pitching line.\\" He also had a quick pickoff move to first base, with Giants' manager John McGraw claiming \\"(Winters) can peg to first base more quickly than any other man in the National League.\\" He performed well in the minor leagues, however a lack of control at the major league level, an indifference towards the game, a lack of ambition and eventually a bad arm ended his hopes of stardom. Following his playing career, he owned a tire company in Abilene, Texas, later becoming that town's mayor. Early and personal life Winters was born on December 22, 1893, in Stephenville, Texas, to John W. Winters and Frances Ruth Winters, the oldest of five children. Prior to playing baseball professionally, he attended two Texas-based universities, playing football and baseball at John Tarleton Junior College, now known as Tarleton State University (into whose Hall of Fame he was elected in 1980), and Hardin‚ÄìSimmons University. It was during his time at Tartleton State University that he acquired the nickname \\"T-Bone.\\" While dining at a restaurant on a road trip, he ordered a T-bone steak. When his waitress brought him a boneless piece of meat, he became unhappy and created a scene. As a result, his teammates gave him the nickname \\"T-Bone.\\" There have been multiple printed variations of his name. He is listed as Jesse Frank Winters on Baseball-Reference.com; however, his middle name is also listed as Franklin by other sources and his first name was commonly spelled \\"Jess\\" during his playing days. Professional career =Early years= Winters began his professional career in 1916 with the Denison Railroaders of the Western Association, though the league disbanded in midsummer. He was preparing to enter medical school following his tryout with Denison, however the Giants signed him to a professional contract. He practiced with the Giants during spring training in 1918, trying out for the team out of college. He was released to the Kansas City Blues of the American Association under an optional agreement prior to the beginning of the 1918 season. He spent all of 1918 with the Blues, going 3‚Äì2 with a 2.42 ERA in 13 games. In 67 innings, he allowed 64 hits, 23 walks and nine unearned runs. His early performance impressed Hall of Fame Giants manager John McGraw so much that McGraw considered Winters \\"...the finest pitching prospect he had seen since Christy Mathewson...\\" Winters also served in the United States Army after being drafted in June of that year. He served as a lieutenant at a San Antonio-area training camp. His professional career was threatened that year, as his outfit had been ordered overseas to fight in World War I. However, the war soon ended and Winters was never sent overseas, allowing him to make his major league debut the following season. =Major league debut= On April 12, 1919, it was announced that Winters had made the Giants' roster for the upcoming season. The team played its first game of the year on April 23, and about two weeks later, on May 3, Winters made his major league debut. Pitching against the Philadelphia Phillies that day, Giants' starter Jean Dubuc allowed three runs in 5.1 innings. Winters was called upon to relieve Dubuc and pitched 3.2 scoreless innings. He struck out two batters and walked one, while allowing three hits. The Giants won the game 4‚Äì3, with Winters earning the win. At the start of the regular season, manager McGraw was \\"banking heavily\\" on the success of Winters as a regular on the staff. Winters played 16 games with the Giants that year, appearing mostly in relief. He won one game while losing two, posting a 5.46 ERA with 13 walks and six strikeouts in 28 innings. He saved three games that year, tying for second in the National League behind Oscar Tuero with, among others, Jean Dubuc. He also finished 11 games, which tied for seventh most in the league and second-most on the team, behind Dubuc. He also hit three batters, which was second on the team behind Rube Benton. Despite being used primarily as a reliever, Winters also started two matches. His first start came on August 22 against the St. Louis Cardinals. He allowed five hits, four walks and three runs to score in 2 1/3 innings and was replaced by Dubuc. He made his second start on August 28 against the Phillies. In six innings, he allowed 10 hits and four walks, which led to nine earned runs. He was again replaced by Dubuc and earned the loss. =1920: Last year with the Giants= While prior to his major league career Winters was being compared to Christy Mathewson, by April 12, 1920, the Milwaukee Sentinel was comparing him to Ferdie Schupp. The newspaper noted Winters' lack of control on the mound and related him to Schupp, who, like Winters, was a very highly touted prospect that initially showed poor control. As Winters did not appear in many games in his rookie season, Schupp too spent the early part of his career primarily in the dugout. However, by 1917, he blossomed by winning 21 games for the Giants. The newspaper predicted a similar output by Winters. During that year's spring training, he quarreled with batter Benny Kauff, which came to fisticuffs before teammates pried them apart and on August 28 of that year, he got into a fistfight with teammate Ross Youngs. He would later be described by The Oklahoma Miner as temperamental and high-strung. Winters appeared as a reliever in 21 games for the Giants that year, going 0‚Äì0 with a 3.50 ERA. He walked 28 batters and struck out 14 in 46 1/3 innings. He also finished 13 games, which tied Earl Hamilton and George Smith for seventh most in the league. In 1920, Winters set a record that would stand until 1925. He became the first pitcher ever to appear in 20 or more games in a season without earning a decision. The previous record was 17 appearances, reached by Hooks Wiltse in 1913. The record was broken five years later by Jack Wisner, who made 25 appearances without a win or loss. Coincidentally, both Wiltse and Wisner pitched for the Giants when they set their respective marks. =Back to the minors and Philadelphia Phillies= On January 7, 1921, the Giants released Winters and fellow pitcher Bunny Hearn to the Milwaukee Brewers of the American Association, though by early February Winters' release was recalled and he returned to the Giants. He was then released to the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League with Vern Spencer on April 11. He pitched in 21 games for the Maple Leafs, going 11‚Äì8 with a 2.91 ERA. In 161 innings, he allowed 156 hits, 54 walks and 23 unearned runs. He also finished third on the team in winning percentage (.579). In July, the Giants traded Winters to the Phillies. There is some uncertainty as to who was involved in the deal that sent Winters to the Phillies and when the deal took place. One source says he was traded on July 25 with Curt Walker, Butch Henline and $30,000 for Irish Meusel and another source claims he was traded with John Monroe for pitcher Cecil \\"Red\\" Causey on July 10. He was used mostly as a starting pitcher for the Phillies in 1921, starting 14 of the 18 games in which he appeared. He went 5‚Äì10 with 10 complete games and a 3.63 ERA in 114 innings, allowing 142 hits, 27 unearned runs and 28 walks while striking out 22 batters. He led the team's starting pitchers in ERA. At the plate, he collected five hits in 39 at-bats for a .128 batting average. On July 21, he was involved in a triple play. He was on first base when Goldie Rapp hit a line drive to the St. Louis Cardinals' second baseman Rogers Hornsby, who tossed the ball to second base to get John Peters. The ball was thrown to first before Winters could return, thus completing the play. Winters began the 1922 season by posting a 2.25 ERA in his first 16 innings of work. He then posted a 5.74 ERA the rest of the way, en route to a season record of 6‚Äì6 and an ERA of 5.34 in 34 games, nine of which he started. He walked 56 batters and had 29 strikeouts. He was second on the team in winning percentage (.500, behind Petie Behan) and games finished (16, one behind George Smith), also leading the club in saves, with two. He tied for seventh in the league in saves and eighth in the league in games finished. At the plate, he hit .256 with two doubles in 45 at bats. He played his final major league season in 1923, going 1‚Äì6 with a 7.35 ERA in 21 games, six of which he started. In 78.1 innings, he allowed 116 hits and 39 walks, while striking out 23 batters. He threw one complete game, against the Brooklyn Dodgers on April 27. His four fielding errors were the fourth-most in the league. Through May 16, he was 1‚Äì2 with a 4.60 ERA in seven games. Due to his performance to that point in the season, Phillies manager Art Fletcher requested waivers for Winters, which could have potentially ended the pitcher's major league career at that point. However, he stuck around until July 30, his final major league game. After his final big league appearance, the Phillies sent Winters to the Hartford Senators of the Eastern League, with whom he played until the end of the season. =Final years= He began 1924 with the Phillies in spring training, however he was sold to the Portland Beavers before the season began. He appeared in 42 games for the Beavers that year, going 16‚Äì20 with a 4.11 ERA. In 285 innings, he allowed 333 hits and 101 walks, leading the team in victories, innings pitched, runs allowed (174) and bases on balls. He finished second behind Charlie Eckert in losses, games, hits allowed and earned runs allowed (144). He spent the majority of 1925 with the Beavers, going 5‚Äì6 with a 5.17 ERA. He also appeared in eight games for the Wichita Falls Spudders, posting a 1‚Äì0 record and a 2.57 ERA. Combined, he went 6‚Äì6 with a 4.41 ERA in 30 games, walking 71 batters and allowing 116 hits in 143 innings. He retired due to a bad pitching arm. Post-playing career and death Following his playing career, Winters became a businessman, opening up D&W; Tire Company in Abilene, Texas, in 1929, which he owned until 1950. He later served as the mayor of Abilene from 1957 to 1959, where he died on June 5, 1986, at the age of 92. The Winters Freeway, which runs through Abilene, is named after him. He was interred at Elmwood Memorial Park in Abilene, Texas.

Early life Baker was born in 1910 as the fourth child of Arthur Ernest Baker and Agnes Flora Baker (n√©e Hindley). His birth records and Census records show his name as John Gilbert Hindley Baker - all the children in the family had 'Hindley' as one of their middle names. Baker entered the Church of England and became Church Missionary Society (CMS) missionary in China in the 1920s. A fluent speaker of English and Cantonese, together with some Mandarin, Baker taught at both Lingnan University and Saint John's University, Shanghai. He travelled extensively over China both before and during Second Sino-Japanese War, being in Canton at the time of the fall of the city to the Japanese. He later had to leave China via the Burma Road in order to reach the United States to marry his wife, who was another missionary in China. Bishop In 1966, Baker was appointed Bishop of the Anglican Diocese of Hong Kong and Macau, succeeding Ronald Hall. He was chosen following the decision of the previous bishop- elect, Archbishop Joost de Blank, not to take up his new appointment due to ill health. Baker was able to ordain, with approval of the Anglican Consultative Council, the first \\"authorised\\" Anglican female priests worldwide. In February 1971, the Anglican Consultative Council (ACC) held its first meeting in Limuru, Kenya, each province sending a bishop, a priest, a layman and a woman observer. By a narrow majority, the ACC passed Resolution 28 which confirmed that \\"the question of the ordination of women was an urgent matter\\" and that if the Bishop of Hong Kong decided to ordain women to the priesthood, \\"his action will be acceptable to this Council\\". On 28 November 1971, Baker ordained Jane Hwang and an English CMS missionary, Joyce M. Bennett, to the priesthood.http://www.womenpriests.org/related/rose_08.asp His predecessor, Ronald Hall, had ordained the first \\"unauthorised\\" female priest. During his time as bishop, Baker remodelled the Bishop's House to incorporate a residence, as Bishop Hall had chosen to live in a bungalow above Dao Fong Shan. Bishop Baker Secondary School in Yuen Long is named after him. He was succeeded as bishop by Peter Kwong in 1981.

Various sources credit him with the invention of the popular Indian/Chinese dish \\"Chicken Manchurian\\". Personal life Wang was born in Kolkata. He is the son of a Chinese immigrant. However, within a few days of his birth, his father died, and he was sent to live with a foster family by his mother. His foster father was a chef, to whom Wang attributes his own love of cooking. Early career Wang came to Mumbai in 1974, with just ‚Çπ27 in his pocket. His first job there was in a small restaurant in Colaba. He also worked a variety of other odd jobs, including being a limbo dancer, at which he claims to be skilled. According to Wang himself, he was a cook at the Cricket Club of India, when in 1975, a customer asked him to create a new dish, different from what was available on the menu. He started by taking the basic ingredients of an Indian dish, namely chopped garlic, ginger, and green chilis; but next, instead of adding garam masala, he put in soy sauce instead, followed by cornstarch and the chicken itself; the result was Chicken Manchurian. China Garden Wang branched out from his job at the CCI in 1983 to start his own restaurant. His restaurant gained popularity, and won various awards proclaiming it \\"India's best restaurant\\". He and his son Eddie would go on to open several restaurants in various parts of India, including Delhi, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Pune and Goa. The restaurant encountered trouble in 1999, when a court ordered him to close it for violating Coastal Regulation Zone rules about building floor area, in a case that took more than fourteen years. A Rediff columnist criticised the ruling as making \\"no sense\\". He reopened the restaurant at the Crossroads Mall in August 2000.

Life Born in Dessau, he attended the Cathedral gymnasium at Brandenburg an der Havel, later became a clerk in the German Post Office and in 1897 he was appointed director of the telegraph lines in Berlin. Although he had already launched a white collar career, his deep love for classical literature and ancient history led him to closely follow the lectures of great scholars of the time, such as the philologist Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, epigraphist Hermann Dessau and philologist Paul M. Meyer, by whom he was introduced to the study of papyrology. In 1903 Preisigke graduated from the University of Halle with a thesis supervised by the orientalist Ulrich Wilcken. In 1908 he became Director of Telegraphs in Strasbourg, and in 1913 was appointed professor at the Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Strasbourg. In June 1915 he was elected an extraordinary member of the Academy of Sciences in Heidelberg, and in 1918 founded the Institut f√ºr Papyrologie in the same city, which continues today to be Germany's leading centre of papyrology.Obituary Friedrich Preisigke H.

Serving as minister of Finance in six cabinets throughout the middle of the 19th century, Van Bosse led many reforms that liberalised the Dutch economy. He led a cabinet himself as Prime Minister of the Netherlands from 4 June 1868 to 4 January 1871. Early life and education Pieter Philip van Bosse was born in Amsterdam, to an insurance broker and his wife. Three of his siblings died at a young age, and his father died when he was eleven years old, after which his mother successfully took over the brokerage firm. He attended the Athenaeum Illustre of Amsterdam, and studied Roman and Contemporary Law in Leiden from 20 May 1829 to 25 January 1834. After his graduation, Van Bosse settled in Weesp as a manufacturer before returning to Amsterdam to work as a lawyer. In 1845, he was appointed referendary of the import and export rights department of the Ministry of Finance, he position he would retain for three years. Political career On 3 June 1848, Van Bosse was appointed Minister of Finance. At the time, most of the state's revenue came from excises, and Van Bosse's attempts to introduce a limited income tax and an interest tax proved unsuccessful. Under the premiership of Johan Rudolph Thorbecke, Van Bosse introduced reforms that liberalised the economy. A strong supporter of free trade, he procured the right of transit and discontinued levy on shipping rights on the Rhine and the IJssel. He reformed the coinage by introducing the silver standard and a simpler system of nickels, dimes, quarters, half guilders and rijksdaalders. Moreover, he reformed the postal system, establishing a government monopoly of postal service. Van Bosse's first ministership came to an end in 1853 with the fall of Thorbecke's cabinet. Van Bosse was elected to the House of Representatives for the constituency of Rotterdam on 14 June 1853, and was re- elected in 1856. In his five years in opposition, he consistently insisted on tax reform and warned for excessive government expenditure. Moreover, Van Bosse won a seat in the municipal council of The Hague in 1857, which he would give up one year later. He served another term as minister of Finance from 12 March 1858 to 22 February 1860. This term was marked by the introduction of inheritance tax. In 1860, Van Bosse returned to the House of Representatives for Zutphen, only to serve a third term as minister of Finance from 10 February to 1 June 1866. On 3 June 1868, Van Bosse started another term as minister of Finance in a cabinet formed by Thorbecke as formateur. However, Thorbecke did not proceed to lead the cabinet, and Van Bosse himself headed the cabinet as Chairman of the Council of Ministers, an office later dubbed Prime Minister. As Prime Minister, Van Bosse executed a policy based on financial solidity. The cabinet was responsible for the abolition of the death penalty and the discontinuation of levy on newspapers, stimulating the newspaper industry. When several ministers in the cabinet resigned for different reasons in late 1870, Van Bosse was forced to resign as Prime Minister. On 4 January 1871, he was succeeded by Thorbecke. Van Bosse was given the honorary title of Minister of State in 1872. However, to his surprise, Van Bosse was appointed Minister of Colonial Affairs at the age of 68. Due to conflict in Aceh, disagreements within the cabinet and the House of Representatives regarding the Dutch East Indies and his tense relation with the Governor General of the colony, Van Bosse was unable to achieve much. He ceased to be minister in 1872, but served another term as minister of Colonial Affairs from 1877. Van Bosse died in office, on 21 February 1879. Private life Van Bosse married Maria Johanna Reijnvaan in Amsterdam on 6 May 1836. The couple had two sons and three daughters. One daughter, Marie Bilders-van Bosse, became a famous landscape painter.

Rowland FitzEustace married three times; it is most likely that her mother was either the first wife, Elizabeth Brune or his second wife, Joan/Genet Bellew, whom he married in about 1463.

The marriage was political; arranged with the purpose of ending the long-standing rivalry between the two families.libraryireland.com, Eleanor Hull, retrieved 23 April 2010 In the early years of their marriage, Margaret and her husband were reduced to penury by James Dubh Butler, an illegitimate nephew and agent of the absentee Thomas Butler, 7th Earl of Ormond, who resided in England and was rumoured to have been the wealthiest subject in the realm. Piers retaliated by killing James Dubh in a skirmish in 1497; however, he received a pardon for his crime on 22 February 1498. Piers had a claim to the Earldom of Ormond, and on 3 August 1515, upon the death of the 7th Earl of Ormond (who had only two daughters as heirs), he succeeded as the 8th Earl of Ormond. Years earlier, in 1498, he and Margaret had seized Kilkenny Castle and made it their chief residence. Through her considerable efforts, the standard of living inside the castle had been greatly improved. In 1528, Margaret's husband was persuaded to renounce his Ormond title in favour of one of his rival claimants, the 7th Earl's grandson, Sir Thomas Boleyn, whose daughter, Anne Boleyn was being courted by King Henry VIII with the purpose of making her queen consort. In 1522, there had been a proposal that Anne should marry James, the eldest son of Margaret and Piers, in an attempt to resolve the dispute over the earldom which had broken out following the death of the 7th Earl and subsequent accession of Piers.Antonia Fraser, The Wives of Henry VIII, 1992, pp.121‚Äì124 She would have brought her Ormond inheritance as dowry, and thus ended the dispute. For reasons unknown, the marriage negotiations ended in failure,Fraser, pp.121‚Äì124 and the King shortly afterwards became enamoured of Anne. To please her as well as elevate her in rank, Henry decided to bestow the earldoms of Ormond and Wiltshire upon her father. Aided by Cardinal Thomas Wolsey Piers was compensated for his loss of title by being made 1st Earl of Ossory that same year (1528). In 1535, James was created Viscount Thurles. Together Margaret and Piers had a total of nine children: *James Butler, 9th Earl of Ormond, Viscount Thurles (1496- 28 October 1546), married Lady Joan Fitzgerald, by whom he had issue. *Richard Butler, 1st Viscount Mountgarret (1500- 20 May 1571), married Eleanor Butler, by whom he had issue. *Thomas Butler, married Joan Sutton, by whom he had issue. *Edmund Butler, Archbishop of Cashel (died 1551) *Catherine Butler (died 17 March 1553), married firstly Richard Power, 1st Baron Le Power and Coroghmore, by whom she had issue; her second husband was James Fitzgerald, 14th Earl of Desmond. *Margaret Butler, married firstly Richard de Burgh \\"MacWilliam\\", by whom she had issue; secondly Barnaby FitzPatrick, 1st Baron of Upper Ossory, by whom she had issue; and thirdly Thomas Fitzgerald, by whom she had two daughters. *Joan Butler, married James Butler of Dunboyne, by whom she had issue. *Eleanor Butler (died after 1550), married Thomas Butler, 1st Baron Cahir, by whom she had issue. *Helen Butler (died 2 July 1597), married Donough O'Brien, 2nd Earl of Thomond, by whom she had issue. Countess of Ormond The earldom of Ormond was restored to Piers on 22 February 1538 after Thomas Boleyn, whose daughter Queen Anne Boleyn had been executed for High Treason in 1536, died. Prior to that date, Piers and Margaret had continued to style themselves as Earl and Countess of Ormond. Margaret was sometimes styled the \\"Great Countess of Ormond\\". She signed herself \\"Margaret Fitzgerald of the Geraldines\\", and occupied herself in legal matters regarding her family and the Ormond estates, having worked with Piers in developing the estate, expanding and rebuilding manor houses. She also established Kilkenny Grammar School.Mary O'Dowd, A History of Women in Ireland 1500‚Äì1800, p.18, Google Books, retrieved on 21 April 2010 She urged Piers to bring over skilled weavers and artificers from Flanders and she helped establish industries for the production of carpets, tapestries and diapers (a type of cloth). Margaret and her husband were responsible for having commissioned significant additions to the castles of Granagh and Ormond. They also rebuilt Gowran Castle, which had been originally constructed in 1385 by James Butler, 3rd Earl of Ormond. Richard Stanihurst described Margaret as having been \\"manlike and tall of staure, liberal and bountiful, a sure friend and a bitter enemy\\".libraryireland.com He also credits her with having improved the standard of living in Kilkenny. Reverend James Graves said of her: \\"The fairest daughter of the Earl of Kildare was unquestionably one of the most remarkable women of her age and country\\". He also claims that she was the \\"traditional builder of nearly every castle in the district\\". Another chronicler considered her \\"a lady so politic, that nothing was thought substantially debated without her advice,O'Dowd, p.18 while another described her as \\"able for wisdom to rule a realm had not her stomach overruled itself\\". Margaret also developed a personal estate on her jointure lands which eventually descended to her younger son, Richard, 1st Viscount Mountgarret. Her husband Piers died in 1539; Margaret was the sole executor of his will. She herself died on 9 August 1542 and was buried in St Canice's Cathedral, Kilkenny alongside Piers. Their effigies are on their tomb.

Beta began on April 14, 2010, and is open to all users with a Perfect World account. On April 30, 2010, the closed beta ended and the open beta began on May 4, 2010. The Guardians of Fate was released on February 22, 2012. Battle of the Immortals takes place in Western Europe, where the player takes the role of a hero to help revive Odin. Besides, Battle of the Immortals is published by Joygame in Turkey since July, 2012. The closed Beta started on September 18, ended on October 11. The open beta which started on October 25 is still on. The game closed all its servers on January 8, 2018. The central gameplay consists of completing quests by NPCs (non-player characters) and hunting monsters to gain experience, which can level a player up and obtain and use better gear in the game. The game is free to download and play, with an optional in-game cash shop that can be used to purchase items to help assist the player in leveling faster or getting better gear. Gameplay Battle of the Immortals features an expansive pet system, a mount upgrade system, and six playable classes. In the new Guardians of Realms update there were the new systems introduced: Fate Cards and Exaltation. Quests There are various quests in the game. Players are given experience and coins and in some cases items from these quests. These items can be armour, weapons, potions and other materials. The more quests that are completed the quicker a character will level up. Several Battle of the Immortals encounters and zones are based on player vs player combat. there are also sub divisions of quests which can be separated into different parts. some of them being branch, scenario, within the day, instance, and such. doing scenario quests will unlock different chapters which make up the foundation of the game, also the rewards from the scenario quests tend to be greater than that from an average quest. Gear and Equipment Armor and weapons can be collected as drops from monsters ingame, as well as being purchased from other players who sell their wares. Each of the five classes have different abilities, so picking the right equipment is essential (a spellcaster will be considerably weakened by using a blade, and the same applies to melee fighters who use a staff.) The game also features \\"Soul Gear\\", which has stats that are more powerful than any other gear at that level. Soul Gear is the best gear in the game to date, and when more than one piece of gear is equipped at one time it provides additional bonuses (more hp/mp, attack power, etc. to help your class). The soul gear system in the game allows for the user to purchase an item that will upgrade the soul gear as it is to the next level gear, allowing transfer of almost all stats (blessing and soul insignias excluded). This helps the player avoid expensive costs of having to remove all the stats in their previous gear and having to redo every piece of armor each time they hit a level gap. Soul gear is obtained by either doing instanced events (level 45 gear in Dragon Emperor, level 60 gear at Spector Island, level 75 at Giza Temple, 90 at Lava Heights, and 100 Doing Pit of Reckoning. In the recently released 'Titan Update', the new level 115 soul gear is obtain by doing the Titan's Trial.) Primal Gear is also newly introduced, giving soul gear-like properties with additional combat-related benefits (more damage per attack or higher defense.) In addition to the Soul Gear system, Battle of the Immortals has extensive weapon and armor upgrade systems which includes Fortification, Gem Embedding, Stardust and Starwords Combination, Gear Blessing, and Soul Insignia Charm. Lastly, the armors can be enhanced with \\"glow effects\\" in game. Pet System The game features a pet system. Pets can be caught by fighting monsters or using items from the Cash Shop and buying them from an in-game merchant. Pets like players have 5 stats. Pet can have up to 6 skills. And another 6 exalted skills, once the pet's fortification level is above 10. Pets can be melded which result in higher generation pet, the highest being Generation 3. They can also be boosted which increases their growth. Growth is used to determine how many HP and MP they gain from their stats. As of the new Guardians of Fate update pets also have 4 types of gear. Items included in the cash shop can either be used as cosmetic (used to change the look of your avatar), upgrades (gems to help improve your gear or pets), and functionality (warcries, which can shout to everyone who is logged into the game server at the time). Fate Cards Fate cards are fairly new system, so some mechanics are locked. However it mostly consists of participating in events, or killing monsters in order to acquire them but also increasing your fate energy which determines how much fate cards you can equip. Fate cards are used to boost stats, but some also cut down other stats. They are divided in 3 ways: Type, Grade and Energy  References   External links  * *Turkey Official Website *BOI Turkey Publisher Joygame * Category:2010 video games Category:Massively multiplayer online role-playing games Category:Windows games Category:Windows- only games Category:Products and services discontinued in 2018 Category:Perfect World games Category:Video games developed in China Category:Free online games Category:Inactive massively multiplayer online games ","title":"Battle of the Immortals"},{"id":"27044725","text":"Debola Ogunseye (born April 27, 1988 in Lagos) is a Nigerian footballer who currently plays for TKƒ∞ Tav≈üanlƒ± Linyitspor in the Turkish TFF First League.

Due to the lack of a reliable mechanism for bringing antibodies into a living cell from the extracellular environment, this typically requires the expression of the antibody within the target cell, which can be accomplished in transgenic animals or by gene therapy. As a result, intrabodies are defined as antibodies that have been modified for intracellular localization, and the term has rapidly come to be used even when antibodies are produced in prokaryotes or other non-target cells. This term can apply to several types of protein targeting: the antibody may remain in the cytoplasm, or it may have a nuclear localization signal, or it may undergo cotranslational translocation across the membrane into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, provided that it is retained in that compartment through a KDEL sequence. Because naturally occurring antibodies are optimised to be secreted from the cell, cytosolic intrabodies require special alterations, including the use of single-chain antibodies (scFvs), modification of immunoglobulin VL domains for hyperstability, selection of antibodies resistant to the more reducing cytosolic environment, or expression as a fusion protein with maltose binding protein or other stable intracellular proteins. Such optimizations have improved the stability and structure of intrabodies, allowing the publication of a variety of promising applications against hepatitis B, avian influenza, prion diseases, inflammation, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. Optimizations required for cytosolic intrabodies are not needed for ER retained intrabodies, which fold in the compartment in which antibodies are naturally produced. Since the 1990s ER intrabodies have been used in various research areas to knock down membrane proteins and secreted proteins.

The neighbourhood is known as an affluent residential area and was home to notable people such as Alexander Parvus, Joseph Goebbels, Gustav Fr√∂hlich, Ernst Udet, and Axel Springer. History The river island, with an area of about , was first mentioned as Der Sandtwerder (\\"Sand Ait\\") in 1704. Also called Cladower Sandwerder after the opposite village of Kladow, the island in the mid 19th century was a deserted place, overgrown with shrubs and a few trees. In 1882, the island was purchased by Wilhelm Wessel, a wealthy inventor and manufacturer of kerosene lamps, for a sum of 9,000 Marks. He ordered extensive landscaping, built an access ringroad, subdivided the area and offered the lots for sale. The intention was for wealthy buyers like himself to build cottages with access to the river. He himself had a mansion, called Villa Schwanenhof (Swan Court), erected in the centre of the isle. Its continued existence makes it the oldest building on the island. For convenient access, a small bridge was built which up to today remains the only way onto the island. Aerial view, 1928 In 1896, a charter was drafted that banned inhabitants from setting up disturbing venues like factories and shops. Even a pier for river steamers was prohibited. In 1901, Emperor Wilhelm II granted the official use of the name Schwanenwerder, a more illustrious name than the old \\"Sand Ait\\". By then, only three villas had been erected, nevertheless the mansion colony quickly developed as a refuge of the wealthy Berlin bourgeoisie, among them Berthold Israel and Rudolph Karstadt, both owners of large department stores, the entrepreneur Leo Maximilian Baginski, the entrepreneur Waldemar Lohse, the entrepreneur Hans Quilitz, the entrepreneur Walter Sobernheim, the phsysician Fedor Krause, the banker Oscar Schlitter, the banker Oscar Wassermann, the banker Eduard Mosler, the banker Arthur Salomonsohn and the banker Georg Solmssen.Gedenktafeln in Berlin.de: Bewohner Schwanenwerder was the most expensive property to purchase in the interwar German version of the Monopoly game. After World War I more rich inhabitans built villas on Schwanenewerder, among them were the banker Samuel Goldschmidt, the economist Werner Feilchenfeld, the entrepreneur Alfred Guggenheim, the judge Herbert Gidion and the publisher Leo Goldstaub.Gedenktafeln in Berlin.de: Bewohner After the Nazi seizure of power in January 1933, many of the Jewish property owners were driven off or forced to sell their real estate because of the racial policy of Nazi Germany. After the elections of March 1933, SA officers from nearby Zehlendorf swarmed over the island, and a Nazi flag was hoisted prominently over the water tower.Fabrice d'Almeida, Royals and the Reich: The Princes von Hessen in Nazi Germany, Oxford, 2006: details noted in Christopher Clark, on- line review Among those who profited from these events were Minister Joseph Goebbels, who in 1935 bought the villa formerly owned by the Oscar Schlitter for a very modest sum,Fabrice d'Almeida, Royals and the Reich: The Princes von Hessen in Nazi Germany, Oxford, 2006: details noted in Christopher Clark, on- line review Three years later, he also purchased the \\"aryanized\\" neighbouring property of the Jewish banker Samuel Goldschmidt. In a similar manner Hitler's personal physician Theodor Morell acquired the premises of Georg Solmssen (the uncle of author Arthur R.G. Solmssen). Minister Albert Speer bought the property of one of the Baronesses Goldschmidt-Rothschild for only 150,000 marks, only to sell it in 1943 at a hefty premium to the Deutsche Reichsbahn. In 1937, Reich Women's Leader Gertrud Scholtz-Klink had a SS Bride School established on Schwanenwerder, where young women were indoctrinated in Nazi ideology and educated in housekeeping skills. After World War II, disseized properties were returned to their rightful owners, if those could be found, but none of them returned. The buildings stood empty and derelict and property was sold, mostly to the community of Berlin, which at times owned up to 40% of the land. Since the late 1940s the island housed a large summer camp for children, which was closed in 2002. Until 2010 a station of the Berlin Wasserschutzpolizei was located near the Schwanenwerder bridge. The neighbouring premises formerly owned by Goebbels were leased to the Berlin Aspen Institute for several years. Tuileries column, re-erected on Schwanenwerder Over the second half of the 20th century, most old mansions were torn down to be replaced with new private buildings. Villenkolonie Schwanenwerder (ghwk.de) Remnants of the historic land development include a column of the demolished Tuileries in Paris, which was bought by Wessel in 1882 and placed on Schwanenwerder as part of a mock ruin, typical of the spirit of Romanticism in late 19th-century Germany.

She graduated from an MA in Painting at the Royal College of Art, London, in 1999, following a BA (Hons) Fine Art from Liverpool John Moores University. She lives and works in London. Work Maybank‚Äôs paintings contain elements from the natural world such as trees, flowers, clouds, and mountains. These natural elements are pared down to simple silhouette forms to act like motifs. Worked most often in monochrome, these motifs or templates are repeated across the surface of the paintings to create a patterning in both the visual composition and through the process of their creation. Influenced from the mid-nineties by the works of Imi Knoebel, Agnes Martin and Ad Reinhardt, Hannah Maybank uses both construction and destruction to create works which echo our relationship to time and the natural world. The cycles within life, both birth and decay, are reflected by the process in which her paintings are made: layers upon layers of latex and acrylic paint are built up to be then stripped, cut and peeled away to reveal both the composition and lifespan of the piece. Starting out as a series of black calligraphic like ink drawings, the composition of each painting is then pre-determined by a series of carefully worked, to-scale line drawings on layers of tracing paper. Sometimes running to a twelve layered and exactly registered set of drawings, these plans are then transferred to the surface of the painting at their pre- designated stage. Success or failure is often granted at the final stages of the making of each piece. The exactitude of all of the drawings is then perversely handed over to chaos, as the surface is ripped, ruptured and sliced and the picture revealed. Career In February 2005, The New Art Gallery Walsall hosted Hannah Maybank‚Äôs first museum exhibition of paintings, including specially commissioned works such as Mounting Interference VI, 2005. The gallery subsequently purchased for their permanent collection Hosts (II), 2004. In London‚Äôs Time Out magazine, in October 2005, at the time of her second solo show at Gimpel Fils, Martin Coomer wrote of the work: > ‚ÄúMost effective is a mountain range of triangular tears that discloses areas > of yellow and orange, like molten ore beneath the earth‚Äôs crust. This is > subtle and intelligent work; fluctuating between paint‚Äôs capacity for > description and its presence as mere ‚Äòstuff‚Äô, it appeals physically as well > as mentally.

Martin Coomer During October to December 2007, Maybank was artist in residence at ArtSway in The New Forest. To be created especially for the ArtSway main gallery space, the triptych Disclosure, 2008‚Äîher largest painting to date‚Äîwas commissioned. In April 2008 this piece was exhibited together with a number of other paintings, and for the first time a set of working shellac ink drawings. In September of the same year The Hatton Gallery, Newcastle, held a major overview of the artist‚Äôs practice. This exhibition also contained In Company, 2008‚Äîcreated especially to be shown alongside Kurt Schwitters's Merzbarn‚Äîand her painting The Visit‚Äîbased upon Ian Fleming‚Äôs The Garden of Gethsemane, 1931, from the Hatton‚Äôs Historic collection.

Rhoda is in the upper left of the woodcut. Rhoda (Gk ÀÅŒ°œåŒ¥Œ∑) is a woman mentioned once in the New Testament. She appears only in Acts . Rhoda (whose name means \\"rose\\"Joseph Henry Thayer, Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament, Rhoda.) was a girl () living in the house of Mary, the mother of John Mark. Many biblical translations state that she was a 'maid' or 'servant girl'. After Peter was miraculously released from prison, he went to the house and knocked on the door. Rhoda came to answer it, and when she heard Peter's voice she was so overjoyed that she rushed to tell the others, and forgot to open the door for him. She told the group of Christians who were praying that Peter was there. They did not believe her at first, and told her she was \\"out of her mind\\". When she kept insisting that it was Peter, they said, \\"He is his angel.\\" Yet Peter kept on knocking, and eventually, they opened the door for him. Peter had walked out of a prison chained to, and guarded by, Roman soldiers and confined behind secure walls; yet, he was unable to get past a gate because a servant girl was too excited to open it for him. Christian historian Jaroslav Pelikan suggests that it is \\"difficult not to smile when reading this little anecdote,\\"Jaroslav Pelikan, Acts (Grand Rapids: Brazos, 2005), 148. while biblical scholar F. F. Bruce says that the scene is \\"full of vivid humor.\\"F. F. Bruce, Commentary on the Book of the Acts (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1964), 251. Pastor and theologian John Gill surmised that Rhoda recognized Peter's voice because she had \\"often heard him preach and converse [with Mary's] family\\".Gill, J. Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible, (http://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/acts/12.htm) accessed 31 August 2015 However, theologians Donald Fay Robinson and Warren M. Smaltz have suggested that the incident involving Rhoda really represents an idealized account of the death of St. Peter, which may have occurred in a Jerusalem prison in 44 AD.Robinson, D. F., 'Where and When did Peter die?', Journal of Biblical Literature Vol 64 (1945), supported by Smaltz, W. M., Did Peter die in Jerusalem?, Journal of Biblical Literature Vol. 71, No. 4 (Dec. 1952), pp. 211-216 accessed 31 August 2015 Writing from a feminist perspective, Kathy Chambers argues that the narrative demonstrates \\"how Christian adaptations of comedic tropes challenged the dominant cultural construction of status and gender, of ecclesial authority, slaves, and women.\\" Chambers connects this story to the fulfillment in Acts 2 of the prophecy of Joel 2 that women and slaves would prophesy. Although \\"Rhoda lacked the necessary authority to have her message taken seriously because of her status of both woman and slave,\\" she had enough courage and faith to keep insisting that it was Peter.

It aired on November 17, 2008. Chuck and the team must break into Guy LaFleur's hotel room and find a list of Fulcrum agents. Meanwhile, Chuck is having trouble having a real relationship with Jill when his undercover life keeps getting in the way. Plot summary =Main plot= Chuck and Jill are enjoying the honeymoon stage of their rekindled relationship. However, Chuck's spy life interrupts when Casey and Sarah inform Chuck that he is needed for an immediate mission to recover a list of CIA Fulcrum agents that Guy LaFleur had apparently hidden in his hotel room before being murdered. Jealousy erupts when Jill finally meets Sarah and learns that Chuck and his handler must pose as a couple, especially when she learns that Sarah is posing as a seductively-dressed escort for the mission. Chuck does his best to reassure Jill that his relationship with Sarah is purely business but only finds himself in more trouble when Jill finds Chuck and Sarah in their hotel room in their underwear after trying to wash off a suspected bioweapon. Chuck desperately tries to explain the surreal situation that Jill witnessed, to which Jill responded with curiosity, revealing LaFleur's affinity to puzzles and vague references to safeguard his valuable information. The team recovers a music box in LaFleur's room, deciphering the clue with Jill's assistance, which leads them to the opera, where they recover an encrypted flash drive with the Fulcrum list. Chuck and Jill leave for a romantic getaway, during which Jill is kidnapped by a Fulcrum agent and held hostage in exchange for the list. Chuck agrees to the exchange, but first makes a copy of the list with Morgan's copying device (designed to copy video games, but apparently able to copy anything). Chuck and Jill embark on another romantic getaway, during which Sarah and Casey discover from the recovered list that Jill is a Fulcrum agent herself. The episode ends with Sarah and Casey rushing to Chuck's room only to find his watch and the next scene shows Chuck and Jill driving away with Chuck completely oblivious to her identity. =Buy More= Emmett is on a personal witch hunt for Chuck. He interrogates Morgan to get some dirt, but Morgan at first refuses. When Emmett threatens the Buy More after-hours poker game Morgan gives up some information and that night at the game Emmett decides to join in. The next day, Emmett has a horrible hangover and Morgan blackmails Emmett with footage of Emmett's drunken stupor.

She is noted for creating dance for stage and film, and for exploring dance for the camera. She was awarded the 2009 Balasaraswati/Joy Ann Dewey Beinecke Endowed Chair for Distinguished Teaching to honor her outstanding contributions as a teacher to \\"shape and preserve dance across generations.\\"American Dance Festival, Background and education Kinney is a native of Dayton, Ohio. She first began her training under Josephine and Hermene Schwarz, with an intense emphasis on ballet and technique. Kinney gained some of her earliest performance experiences through her time studying with Josephine Schwarz, and she describes the school as one geared towards training dancers to become professionals. Even though modern dance was not widely taught at the time, the Schwarzes introduced dancers at their school to the Humphrey-Weidman modern technique at the age of thirteen. These classes were Kinney‚Äôs first foray away from ballet into the field of modern dance, and she was enticed by the chance to ‚Äúfly and leap‚Äù across the dance floor. In addition, she was introduced to improvisation, bare feet, and ponytails, which all represent drastic departures from the strict dress code and class etiquette expected in ballet classes. She thus graduated from high school with a solid and impressive background, mainly in ballet, supplemented by these modern classes and classes taken at other studios in jazz and tap and by outside performances in musicals. She enrolled at Ohio State University where she received her Bachelor of Science in Education with a major in Dance and a minor in Physical Education. Her teacher at Ohio State University, Helen P. Alkire, was another instrumental influence in Kinney‚Äôs development as a dancer. Alkire originally established the dance program through the physical education department, which has now developed into a prestigious fine arts program. Kinney accredits Alkire with introducing her to modern dance greats like Martha Graham and Merce Cunningham in addition to modern music and art. Most importantly, Alkire introduced her to the American Dance Festival, which Kinney attended through scholarship. It was there where Kinney was introduced to Paul Taylor, whose company she later joined. After graduating from Ohio State University she moved to New York City and shortly after received a call from Paul Taylor asking if she would be interested in auditioning for a dance he was choreographing to be premiered at the American Dance Festival. That piece was \\"Aureole,\\" which is now known as one of Taylor's signature works. Consequently, when Taylor later left Martha Graham‚Äôs company, Kinney was invited to become a member of his new company in 1962. Performance Kinney is known for being an original member of the Paul Taylor Dance Company. She first danced with Taylor in Aureole. Other works: *Insects and Heroes (1961) *Piece Period (1962) *Scudorama (1963) *Party Mix (1963) *The Red Room (1964) *Post Meridian (1965) *Epic (originally Paul Taylor‚Äôs solo, restaged for Kinney to be performed at Richard Move‚Äôs show Martha @ Mother) In addition to Paul Taylor works, Kinney has appeared throughout her career in the choreography of Dan Wagoner, Yuriko, Sara Rudner, Viola Farber, Ruth Currier, Doris Humphrey, Doug Varone, Douglas Neilsen, Chris Burnside, Timm Callaghan, and most recently Victoria Marks. Choreography In 1966 Ms Kinney left the Paul Taylor Company to start her family. She continued to perform and teach in New York City while raising her two sons, Joshua Binder and John Henry Binder. In 1972 she returned to Ohio State University to teach dance in the Dance Department for 3 years. It was there that she began choreographing her own work and decided to return to New York City to start her own dance company. From 1977 to 1980 she presented her solo and group works at various dance venues in New York City including Dance Theater Workshop. During those years she taught, performed and choreographed at various universities and festivals in the United States. In 1979 she was selected to choreograph the dance choreography for the movie Popeye (film) directed by Robert Altman starring Robin Williams and Shelley Duvall. It was this once in a lifetime opportunity that started her career in dance for the camera. She has choreographed over 30 dances for the stage, such as: *Afternoons/Evening of Dance *Passages *3 ¬Ω Solos *Take Two *Bits and Pieces *To Be Continued‚Ä¶.. *At the Edge *Endangered Dream *Dance in the Sculpture Garden *Flashpoint Other films include *Leap of Faith *I‚Äôll Do Anything as Assistant to the Choreographer Musicals *In Trousers *Letter to Ben Teaching Along with being recognized as one of the first members of the Paul Taylor Company, a performer, choreographer for the stage, and choreographer for dance for the camera, Kinney is also known for being an influential teacher. She was an Associate Professor of Dance at Virginia Commonwealth University for 15 years and now teaches at the California State University at Long Beach. She has also taught at New York University, Juilliard, and Pratt University in addition to Ohio State University. She has taught internationally in Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, and South America, as well as at the highly regarded American Dance Festival. Dance For Camera Having been influenced by the movie musicals of the 1950s and 1960s, most notably Singing in the Rain and Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, and her experience choreographing Popeye, she wanted to further study the process of choreographing for the camera. While teaching at Virginia Commonwealth University she choreographed, produced, and directed a dance video, Choreographic Journey In addition she worked with other faculty members who were also interested in making works created for the camera. Kinney notes that she encouraged her students at Virginia Commonwealth University to pursue further studies of dance through graduate school and additional training, which inspired her to take her own advice.Sharon Kinney, interview, 2010 As described in her faculty profile page at the California State University in Long Beach, \\"in 1997 she relocated to Los Angeles and pursued her MFA at the University of California, Los Angeles in the World Arts and Cultures Department and received her degree in 2000, in Choreography for Dance and the Camera. While at UCLA she was selected to participate in the 1998 UCLA Dance/Media Fellowship Project funded by NIPAD and received a grant from NIPAD to make a 45-minute documentary of the original dance performance in NYC called From the Horse's Mouth directed by Jamie Cunningham and Tina Croll. The documentary was screened at The Wexner Center, Jacob's Pillow, the American Dance Festival, The Kitchen in NYC, New York University, Sarah Lawrence, Virginia Commonwealth University, Gunston Arts Center in Arlington Virginia, and various venues in Los Angeles. She also travels with the documentary, conducts discussions about dance documentation and the making of a dance documentary, most recently in Fort Worth Texas at The Museum of Modern Art. This last year she served on the board of the Dance Camera West in Los Angeles.\\"California State University Long Beach, Kinney felt a strong connection to From the Horse's Mouth since she was able to participate as well as document the original performance, a historic first of many future performances; she also appreciated the story aspect. She described in an interview, \\"I wanted to ask each one of these people why they were still dancing?\\" As a young dancer she had been asked many times, ‚ÄúWhat are you going to do when you stop dancing?\\" She thought it would be interesting to know this because she herself had never stopped dancing and neither had they. She was interested in hearing their individual stories and how and why they were continuing to dance and adapt their love of dance to other interests and other aspects of their lives.Sharon Kinney, interview, 2010 Awards With two other past members of the Paul Taylor company, Carolyn Adams and Ruth Andrien, Kinney received the American Dance Festival 2009 Distinguished Teaching Honor award. The award is more formally known as the 2009 Balasaraswati/Joy Ann Dewey Beinecke Endowed Chair for Distinguished Teaching and the award was created to ‚Äúpay tribute to the teachers who have shaped and preserved dance across generations.‚Äù Past recipients of the distinguished award include famous members within the modern dance spectrum, such as Pearl Primus and Anna Halprin. The award \\"signifies the importance of honoring those who act to preserve the traditions of modern dance while continuing to expand and broaden its definition.\\"American Dance Festival, www.americandancefestival.org/history/awards.html Present day Kinney greatly values the guidance of her teachers, such as Helen P. Alkire, Paul Taylor, and Josephine Schwarz. Her exceptional training inspires her to continue passing down dance knowledge and stories of her experience to students. In 1947 Charles Weidman, in a master class Kinney attended, told the other dancers in the class that ‚Äúyou love to dance and you will always love to dance, but you will always need to teach to support your love of dance.‚Äù She feels an incredible sense of fulfillment in watching the growth and progression of her students. Today she continues to teach at California State University at Long Beach teaching Composition, Repertory and Dance for Camera classes as well as for the Paul Taylor Dance Company in New York City.

The colour of the bark is pale brown to pale grey-brown, with some stems appearing reddish where stained by soil from termites. The compound leaves have 3 to 7 pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaflets and one terminal leaflet. The leaflets are 20 ‚Äì 50 mm long and the leaves are up to 250 mm long overall. The leaves are glossy dark green or blue-green above, and yellow-green beneath. Fine silky hairs are present on the undersides of the leaves and on the midrib. Older leaves turn yellow and these trees lose most of their leaves in the drier months (winter), but they are soon replaced by new leaves which are reddish-brown and velvety at first. The flowers are similar to those of wisteria, and are described as mauve, lilac or purple in colour. The fruits are flat, woody pods up to 150 x 40mm and covered with a velvety layer of reddish to golden brown hairs. The pods split (often with a loud popping noise) when dry to release flat, oblong seeds which are easy to grow in fine sandy soil. Ecological importance At least four species of butterfly larvae feed on the leaves.Williams, M. (1994). Butterflies of Southern Africa; A Field Guide.

He was the elected Vice Governor of the Province of Bataan, in the Philippines. Garcia entered politics in 1987 when he was elected Congressman representing the 2nd district of Bataan. In 1992 he was elected as the Governor of Bataan. He returned to serve as Congressman for the 2nd district of Bataan from 1995 to 2004. In 2004, he was elected again as Governor of Bataan, and won reelection in 2007. He ran as the incumbent Governor of Bataan in the 2010 elections, and won with 212,808 votes, which resulted in an almost 80,000 vote margin. Garcia died on June 13, 2016, a month after he was proclaimed as the newly elected vice governor of Bataan. He was 75. Early life and education Enrique \\"Tet\\" Garcia Jr. was born on September 13, 1940 in Pasay City to Enrique Garcia Sr., and Emiliana Tuazon Garcia. He is the eldest of 10 children of his parents. As a child, Garcia attended Balanga Elementary School from 1947 to 1953. He attended Bataan High School from 1953 to 1957, graduating as the Salutatorian of the class. He attended De La Salle University and earned his bachelor's degree in business administration in 1963. Accomplishments Garcia entered politics in 1987 and was elected to the House of Representatives, representing the 2nd district of Bataan. Since then he has been credited with numerous accomplishments, only a few of which are listed below. =Fight To Keep Petrochemical Industry in Limay, Bataan= During Garcia's first term in the Philippine Congress, from 1987 to 1992, he became widely known for vigorously and ultimately successfully fighting to keep the petrochemical industry in the province of Bataan. Arguing that the transfer of the petrochemical plant to Batangas was unfair to Bataan and to the Philippines as a whole, he fought the plant's transfer all the way to the Supreme Court in a landmark case. On August 24, 1990, to emphasize his belief in the truth and importance of what he was fighting for, Garcia took an emphatic leave of absence from the House of Representatives and vowed to resign if the petrochemical plant's transfer was not stopped. Garcia had filed a petition before hand asking the Supreme Court to stop the transfer of the Petrochemical plant to Batangas. On November 9, 1990, the Supreme Court of the Philippines issued its final decision on Garcia's petition, G.R. No. 92024 and ruled that the Philippines' Board of Investments had indeed erred in approving the transfer of Luzon Petrochemical Corporation from Bataan to Batangas, and that the Board of Investments also erred in approving the change in feedstock from naptha only to \\"naphtha and/or liquefied petroleum gas;\\". The Court ordered that the original certificate of registration of Bataan Petrochemical Plant, wherein it operates in Limay, Bataan, be maintained. The Court agreed with Garcia that the intended transfer of the Petrochemical Plant from Bataan to Batangas was disadvantageous to the national government and to the province of Bataan on a variety of grounds. Garcia triumphantly returned to the House of Representatives after the Supreme Court issued its decision, and triumphantly proclaimed that the Supreme Court ruling vindicated his monumental \\"fight for justice.\\" =The Creation Of The Bataan Polytechnic State College= In February, 1998, then Congressman Enrique 'Tet' Garcia was able to get his bill creating the Bataan Polytechnic State College (now the Bataan Peninsula State University) passed into law, Republic Act No. 8562, titled 'An Act Converting The Medina Lacson De Leon School Of Arts And Trades In The Municipality Of Balanga, Province Of Bataan, Into A Chartered State College, To Be Known As The Bataan Polytechnic State College, Integrating Therewith The Bataan Community Colleges In The Municipality Of Balanga, Province of Bataan, And Appropriating Funds Therefor'. This law enabled the college education systems in Bataan to receive much more in assistance from the national government, amounting to more than 70 million pesos yearly. In March 2007, through the efforts of now Congressman Albert S. Garcia, and building on the earlier work of now Governor Enrique T. Garcia, the Bataan Polytechnic State College system became the Bataan Peninsula State University system, integrating various campuses province wide. = Conversion of the municipality of Balanga into a city = During his congressional term from 1998 to 2001, then congressman Enrique 'Tet' Garcia was able to get his bill converting the municipality of Balanga into a city, passed into law. Republic Act No. 8984, 'AN ACT CONVERTING THE MUNICIPALITY OF BALANGA, BATAAN PROVINCE INTO A COMPONENT CITY TO BE KNOWN AS THE CITY OF BALANGA' became law in December 2000. then congressman Tet Garcia was aided in getting this bill passed into law through the efforts of his son Albert S. Garcia, who was mayor of Balanga at this time. The conversion of Balanga into a component city enabled it to receive a larger share of the revenue allotment from the national government, along with numerous other benefits and advantages. Thus it was through this act that Balanga City has grown by leaps and bounds economically as a city since then. =Closing The BIR Tax Checks Loophole= In the years from 1978 to 2003, there had been a loophole in the BIR check payment system that was taken advantage of by syndicates who were then successful of stealing billions of pesos from the Philippine government. From the year 2000 to 2003, then Congressman Enrique Garcia devised and recommended simple solutions on how to stop the BIR check tax payment loopholes. These recommendations were publicized and taken account of by Philippine Star columnist Federico Pascual in his July 15, 2003 article titled 'Garcia programs can save P100B for gov‚Äôt'. On October 27, 2003 the Department of Finance finally adopted Garcia's recommendations by issuing Clearing House Operating Memo (CHOM) No. 375. On May 9, 2008, the Philippine Clearing House Corporation through Clearing House Operating Memo (CHOM) No. 427, adopted an additional recommendation of Garcia, which was to have the name of the government institution indicated on the tracer band to be painted/sprayed at the back of the checks. According to the memo, this would act as an \\"additional control/tracing point for the banks in proving their inward cheques that are payable to the BIR or BOC.\\" =Bataan Iskolar Ng Bayan Program= The provincial government of the Province of Bataan under Governor Garcia started the 'Iskolar ng Bayan' scholarship program for college students in 2004 As of early 2010 there were 9000 current scholars, with the aim of increasing the number further to 12000 scholars after May 2010. Currently, 3000 scholars are from the 1st District of Bataan, while 6000 scholars are from the 2nd District of Bataan. The scholarship program is open to college level students who are permanent residents of Bataan. The scholarship can be used for any college level institution, whether inside or outside the province. In 2008, Governor Enrique 'Tet' Garcia's provincial office contributed P20,000,000 to the program, while Congressman Albert Garcia of the 2nd district of Bataan contributed P10,000,000 to the program. Mayor Joet Garcia further contributed P10,000,000 to the program. This is one of the largest scholarship programs ever instituted in the Philippines for college level students.

Olmeca was launched in 1967 and now has a presence in 80 countries worldwide. Olmeca is a mix of Tequila. Olmeca Altos 100% Agave Tequila was launched in November 2009. Olmeca Tez√≥n is a 100% Agave, 100% Tahona Liquid Tequila.  Production  Made from blue agave picked after 7‚Äì8 years of growth. Once harvested, traditional brick ovens are then used to slow cook the pi√±as. Part of the production process involves using the 500-year-old traditional and artisan Tahona method, which consists of a 2 tonne millstone made of volcanic rock, known locally as Tezontle. Once the Agave pi√±as have been harvested and cooked, they are crushed by the Tahona, creating a pulp and drawing out the sweet juice from the fibres. This juice is referred to as Tahona Liquid, of which a percentage is integrated into the fermentation and distillation process of all Olmeca Tequilas, with Olmeca Tez√≥n exclusively containing 100% Tahona Liquid ‚Äì certified by Consejo Regulador del Tequila.Constancia CRT Proceso Artesanal Tahona Tez√≥n, 22/06/2009/  Origins  Olmeca Tequilas are produced at Destileria Colonial de Jalisco. Operation at the plant is overseen by Maestro Tequilero Jes√∫s Hern√°ndez and his team of workers. The Master Distiller is responsible for supervising all production, from the harvest of the plants in the agave fields to the bottling of the tequila. The Olmeca distillery is situated in the town of Arandas, Jalisco, the unofficial capital of Los Altos (2104 metres above sea level), taking advantage of the blue agave plants that are grown locally.  Reviews of Olmeca  Spirit ratings organizations, such as the San Francisco World Spirits Competition and Beverage Testing Institute, have given accolades to some Olmeca tequilas.

The infection caused lymphatic myocarditis, killing an otherwise healthy McGregor. \\"In an unusual manifestation of a viral illness, this organism infiltrated his heart muscle and disrupted the electrical pathways that signal the heart to beat properly,\\" a statement from his family said. \\"The heart muscle may have recovered from the viral attack had these electrical pathways not been destroyed, but the muscle may have been permanently weakened and destined for eventual heart failure.\\" It continued, \\"Just as a healthy brain can be infected with viral meningitis, a healthy heart can be infected with viral myocarditis,\\" the McGregor family stated. \\"Fortunately, the vast majority of viral illnesses do not damage the heart or the brain.\\" Keli McGregor, late Rockies president, died of rare virus that attacked his heart, family says During one of the final home games of the 2010 season, the Rockies honored McGregor by placing his initials amongst the retired numbers at Coors Field.

The sun rays are enhanced by drawing on the glass negative Frederick Christian Palmer (East Stonehouse, Plymouth 1866 ‚àí Hungerford 1941; fl.1892‚Äì1935), known professionally as Fred C. Palmer, was the main public photographer of Herne Bay, Kent in the early years of the 20th century, working from Tower Studio. He photographed all the civic events in Herne Bay before 1914, and made portraits of the eccentric Edmund Reid, the erstwhile head of Metropolitan Police Service CID who had investigated the Whitechapel murders and then retired to Hampton-on-Sea, Herne Bay. In 1913 Marcel Duchamp used Palmer's 1910 photograph of the illuminated Grand Pier Pavilion as found object art in his Note 78, part of his Green Box artwork. In the 1920s and early 30s, Fred C. Palmer took over William Hooper's Cromwell Street studio in Swindon, again producing local postcards, photographing prominent people and doing freelance work for local newspapers and the Council. Biography =Background= Lord Mayor of London's parade, Herne Bay 1910 He was born at 31 Union street, East Stonehouse, Plymouth on 9 January 1866, the son of Royal Navy bandsman William Eastman Palmer who had by then become a journeyman photographer.Birth certificate of Frederick Christian Palmer, 9 January 1866, East Stonehouse, Devon The name \\"Christian\\" came from the boy's grandmother Christian Branton Eastman Lewis,Born 1806 in Devon, widowed by 1851 (1851 census) and died 1866, East Stonehouse, aged 60 who married his grandfather Henry Palmer, a shoemaker,born 1806 (1841 census) in Okehampton, Devon in 1826. Fred C's father W.E. Palmer married Maria Louisa Eales on 13 March 1860 and they were living in James Street, Stoke Damerel, in 18611861 Census and ten years later at 13 Frances Street at St Andrew's in Plymouth.1871 Census She was a \\"photographic artist\\", which could mean that she tinted or drew on prints from glass negatives or somehow enhanced daguerreotypes, and it was probably her influence which brought the profession of photography into the family. So W.E. Palmer became a photographer in the mid-1860s, and had twelve children including seven sons, at least five of whom were trained as photographers. The business was named William Eastman Palmer & Sons, and Frederick Christian was the third son. His brothers who trained as photographers were William George, John Eastman, Ernest Charles and Henry Reginald.Two brothers were not photographers: Albany Edward Palmer trained as an insurance clerk and Dudley Sidney M. Palmer's career is unknown. In 1881 in East Barnet Fred C. was 15 years old and had started his photographic apprenticeship.1881 Census In 1891 when Frederick Christian was 25 years old, he was still living at home and the family was at Hopetown Villa, Leicester Road, East Barnet. At that time his father William Eastman Palmer was still described as a journeyman photographer.1891 Census =Adult life= Church at Minster, Thanet, 1903‚Äì1904 In 1894 Frederick Christian Palmer was married in the parish of St George Hanover Square to Eleanor Florence M. Maltby, who had been born in Highbury in 1873. They had three children: Leslie Reginald, born 1896; Muriel Audrey, born in 1902; and Joyce Selwyn, born in 1905. The first two were born in Barnet, and the third in Herne Bay. In 1901 Frederick was practising as a photographer and the family was living at Gresham Cottage in Plantagenet Road in New Barnet. In 1911 they were all at Palmer's Tower Studio in Herne Bay; Frederick was again listed in the census as a photographer and Eleanor was assisting in the business. He may possibly have been related to Fred T. Palmer (fl.1890‚Äì1899), photographer of Ramsgate and Croydon. Palmer may have moved to Watford around 1936‚Äì1937 but did not die there;The GRO ledger entry for the death of a Frederick Palmer in the second quarter of 1940 does not relate to him. The GRO ledger entry for deaths in 1940 says: \\"Frederick Palmer ‚Äì Age 74 ‚Äì June 1940 ‚Äì 3a 1892 ‚Äì Watford\\". his daughter Muriel Audrey had married Charles William Raysbrook in 1925 in Strood and then had three children in Watford. He died on 14 March 1941, aged 75 years, of old age at The Grey Cottage, formerly Prospect House, at 1 Prospect Road, Hungerford. His death certificate gives his occupation as master photographer, retired.Death certificate The term, master, in this context at that time implied that he had photographers working under him in a studio, and did not refer to a specific qualification. His son Leslie Reginald was present at the death, but it is not known whether The Grey Cottage was the residence of either father or son. Professional life =Herne Bay= World War I soldiers Although photographic film was available, it is probable that Fred C. Palmer used large‚àíformat glass negatives and that the postcards and portraits were direct prints from these, because of their fine detail. From 1892 to 1903 he was working for the family firm, William Eastman Palmer & Sons, at Bloom House, Leicester Road, New Barnet. From 1903 to 1922 he was working as a photographer and picture-frame maker in Herne Bay, at 21 High Street from 1903 to 1905 (where Kent Kebab is, as of 2011), and at Telford Villa, 6 Tower Parade from 1907 to 1922. and Information from trade directories; confirmed by photographic historian Ron Cosens at Carte de Visite, and notes held by The Swindon Collection. Between 1910 and 1916,1910‚Äì1913: Palmer is credited with Herne Bay Press photographs. 1910‚Äì1916: local Blue Book directories list Palmer at his studio in Tower Parade, Herne Bay, Kent. 1919‚Äì39: no obituary for Palmer is listed in Herne Bay Press. 1930‚Äì31: Blue Book lists a different proprietor at the Tower Parade studio. Four soldiers named Fred C. Palmer are listed in the National Archives as World War I dead. However it is not now thought that Palmer died between 1916 and 1919. Fred C. Palmer was a freelance Herne Bay Press newspaper photographer,Herne Bay Press was taken over by Kentish Gazette, which is now owned by Kent Messenger. who worked from Tower Studio in Tower Parade on the Sea Front where he took portraits.1915‚Äì1916 Blue Book directory at Herne Bay Library . He had a small shop or kiosk called The Art Gallery on the sea front, separate from the studio, where he sold postcards and portrait prints.Information from the Mount fishing family of Herne Bay, whose ancestors were photographed by Fred C. Palmer He produced postcards of important town events, such as the grand opening of Herne Bay Pier's Grand Pier Pavilion by the Lord Mayor of London on 3 August 1910, and the grand opening of the King Edward VII Memorial HallToday it is known as the King's Hall by Princess Beatrice on 13 July 1913. His name was usually given as Fred C. Palmer in newspaper photograph credits and on the backs of his picture postcards. =World War I= Swindon 1920s During World War I there are no written records of Fred C. Palmer, but he did produce postcards of war- wounded Belgians recuperating in Canterbury and Herne Bay, of a possible 1914 recruitment rally and of soldiers larking about.See :File:FCP Canterbury 006.jpg, :File:FCP Herne Bay 007.jpg, :File:FCP Herne Bay 008.jpg, :File:FCP World War I horses 1915.jpg There was a shortage of silver for use on photographic plates, so this may be why he appears to have been limited to photographing the troops and war-wounded and perhaps other work until 1920. =Swindon= Around 1920‚Äì1921 Palmer took over the studio of the established photographer William Hooper at 6 Cromwell Street, Swindon. Street directories state that he was there between 1923 and 1936. The building is now demolished. He published postcards and portraits and was freelance photographer for local newspapers; the same professional pattern as in Herne Bay before the war. Swindon Council used his photographs. He retired around 1936‚Äì1937 at the age of approximately 70 years, and died in 1941.Information from The Swindon Collection at Swindon Central Library =Photograph of Grand Pier Pavilion, 1910= Scan of an original print by Palmer of the Grand Pier Pavilion Illuminated Palmer's 1910 photograph of the illuminated Grand Pier Pavilion was incorporated as found object art in an artwork by Marcel Duchamp following the latter's visit to Herne Bay in 1913. Duchamp cut out Palmer's photo from a leaflet and attached it to Note 78 in The Green Box describing his plans for a work called The Large Glass (1915‚Äì1923). The notes including Palmer's photograph were published in two limited editions, and were considered part of, and not just an adjunct to, the Large Glass artwork. In August 2013 a \\"Duchamp in Herne Bay 1913‚Äì2013\\" festival was organised in the town to celebrate and explore Duchamp's 1913 visit to Herne Bay and the relationship between that experience and his artwork. Palmer's postcard of the Grand Pier Pavilion, illuminated, was used to promote that festival. =Portraits of Edmund Reid= Edmund Reid by Palmer, 1912 In 1910‚Äì1912 Palmer photographed Edmund Reid who had been head of the Metropolitan Police Service CID at the time of the Whitechapel murders. Reid had retired to Hampton-on-Sea, a settlement which was fast sinking into the Thames Estuary prompting the old man to make attempts at publicity and to demand assistance from the Council. Palmer photographed this eccentric character amid the progressing disaster and gave or sold the images to Reid in the form of postcards. The old man retailed Palmer's photographs from a kiosk, calling the collection an art gallery. Reid was mocked for selling postcards of himself and calling it art, but when Duchamp chose to take another Palmer photograph home in 1913 and made an artwork of it, Reid's insight was validated. One example: the Ronald Cecil Concert Party postcard Ronald Cecil Concert Party postcard, ca.1913 The Ronald Cecil Concert Party postcard shows a crowd on the Herne Bay seafront around 1913, including rehearsed and choreographed tableaux vivants by actors. It was apparently produced in response to the contemporary eagerness of aficionados to collect and examine (with a hand lens) the detailed prints made from large glass negatives. The signature of such a postcard is the inclusion of tableaux signifying the fleeting moment, and in this example it is the running boy about to go out of frame on the left,Said by the servant Little Warner to be a boy from the St Georges Terrace school in Herne Bay. and the policeman checking his watch in the foreground. The positions of the actors would be held still for the camera at a prearranged moment, which may have been announced by the chiming of the clock tower out of frame to the right,See :File:Fred C Palmer 005b.jpg which shows the Ronald Cecil Concert Party stage positioned next to the clock tower. or a call from the man on the right of the stage. Some of the tableaux are as follows: (1) The suffragette mounting a bicycle and incidentally showing a little more ankle than such a young woman might intend at that time, in the right foreground. She is wearing black stockings, which in 1913 could signify a servant or actress. (2) The young man acting hot under the collar, apparently being berated by a woman, and exchanging a glance with a well-dressed and confident young dandy in sports jacket and white shoes, with one hand in pocket and the other possibly holding a cigarette. (3) Ronald Cecil himself apparently falling backwards in the crowd, although nobody around him turns to look. This is at the centre-back of the crowd. The viewer's attention is drawn to Cecil's fall by the insouciant young man standing below the lamppost in cap and three-piece tweed suit and arms akimbo, looking directly at Cecil falling. (4) Two housemaids ‚Äì G.M. Warner, known as Little Warner, and her fellow servant, both employed from age 12 by the boys' school at St George's Terrace ‚Äì are walking in the aisle between the concert party audience and the fence. They are carrying posters or leaflets for the concert party, and were supposed to do something with the former, but were prevented by the presence of children.Information from Gertrude Mabel Warner, \\"Little Warner\\", 1896‚Äì1979. The regatta in the background suggests a Saturday, and the beams from the late afternoon sun passing through the windows on both sides of the Grand Pier Pavilion suggest a time of around 4.30pm. Among the public, a private nurse in uniform can be seen on the right, and the deckchair boys employed from age 12 are near the left foreground in the aisle between stage and fence. Art gallery Art gallery was Edmund Reid's name for his postcard collection of photographs by Palmer.

Soon Russell's work for Judge included cartoons of homeless men, as he recalled, \\"I started drawing tramps for Judge, the old humorous magazine, and pretty soon Pete began to evolve.

Southern dome Location The church is located at the start of Olympou Street, near the city's western medieval walls. History and description Fresco of 14th century As evidenced by remnants of a column to the south of the church and a cistern to its northwest, it originally formed part of a larger complex. Consequently, it appears that the church was originally built as the katholikon of a monastery. The date of its construction is not entirely clear: the founder's inscription above the entrance, the monograms in the capitals and other inscriptions refer to Nephon I, Patriarch of Constantinople in 1310‚Äì1314, as the ktetor. Another inscription on the eastern wall commemorates the same patriarch and his pupil, the hegumenos Paul, as first and second ktetores respectively. Recent analysis using carbon-14 however points to a later date for the entire structure, ca. 1329. A depiction of the hegumenos Paul kneeling before Mary, as well as a series of Marian scenes lead to the conclusion that the church was dedicated to Mary, perhaps to be identified with the Monastery of Theotokos Gorgoepikoos. The building belongs to the type of the composite, five-domed cross-in-square churches, with four supporting columns. It also features a narthex with a U-shaped peristoon (an ambulatory with galleries), with small domes at each corner. There are also two small side-chapels to the east. The exterior walls feature rich decoration with a variety of brick-work patterns. The interior gives a very vertical impression, as the ratio of height to width of the church's central bay is 5 to 1. The interior decoration consists of rich mosaics on the upper levels, inspired by Constantinopolitan models. These are particularly important as some of the last examples of Byzantine mosaics (and the last of its kind in Thessaloniki itself). Frescoes complete the decoration on the lower levels of the main church, but also on the narthex and one of the chapels. These too show influence from Constantinople, and were possibly executed by a workshop from the imperial capital, perhaps the same which decorated the Chora Church. They were probably carried out under the patronage of the hegumenos Paul, after 1314 or in the period 1328‚Äì1334. With the conquest of the city by the Ottoman Turks, in ca. 1520‚Äì1530 the church was converted into a mosque with the name Soƒüuksu Camii (\\"Mosque of the Cold Water\\"). As was their usual practice, the Ottomans covered the mosaics and frescoes with plaster, after they removed the gold tesserae. The church's modern name, \\"Holy Apostles\\", was not attributed to the building until the 19th century. Restoration and the gradual revealing of the frescoes began in 1926. After the 1978 earthquake, the building was strengthened, and in 2002, the mosaics were cleaned up.

They varied from traditional interpretations of the teaching dependent on Eastern monastics to popular and influential groups classified as New Religious Movements. The NBO's stated intent was to promote greater openness to dialogue and increased co-operation between the many different Buddhist organisations. As its policy met with success, the Network also turned its attention to dialogue and co- operation with other faiths and to taking part in consultation with government and other public bodies, including the Charity Commission and the Equality and Human Rights Commission. Nationally, it plays an active role in the work of the Religious Education Council,REC website the Inter Faith Network UKMember Bodies of the Inter Faith Network , retrieved 2010-05-03. and internationally in the European Buddhist Union.European Buddhist Union member organizations - Network of Buddhist Organisations - UK, updated 2010-04-30, retrieved 2010-05-03. Another aspect of NBO's work has been the series of conferences and events it has helped organise on topics centred upon the application of Buddhist teaching to the modern world. Noteworthy among these have been the UK-wide Buddhist arts festival, \\"A Lotus in Flower\\", in 2005;A poster advertising one of the events is archived here the 2006 conference, \\"The Dharma Revolution: 50 Years On\\", on Ambedkarite (Indian) Buddhism;A report the 2007 Eco-Dharma conference held in Birmingham;NBO Connections 2, Winter 2007, pp.10-12 the 2008 \\"British Buddhist Landscape\\" conference held at Taplow Court, covering many aspects of Buddhist social practice and experience in Britain;SGI Quarterly, October 2008; videos of the presentations of all the speakers are available on Google and the 2009 arts conference, \\"Buddha Mind, Creative Mind\\",Triratna Buddhist Community News, July 2009 also held at Taplow Court. The last of these resulted in the formation of the Dharma Arts group, an association of Buddhist artists.Dharma Arts website Again in Birmingham, a day seminar for Buddhists working with schools was organised by Clear Vision Trust in association with NBO as part of Celebrating RE month in March 2011.Triratna Community News April 21, 2011 During the run-up to the 2011 census, the NBO, in common with many other organisations, ran a public campaign for adherents to identify themselves in the box indicating religious affiliation in order to gain enhanced official recognition.\\"British Religion in Numbers\\" In 2012 the Network co-ordinated the Buddhist contribution to the Government's multi-faith initiative, A Year of Service.Faith-based Regeneration Network This involved a day of action on July 3 with care for the environment as its focus, and was publicised under the name Earthkind.FbRN report The response was so positive that subsequently it was decided to hold an annual Buddhist Action Month each June (BAM) with participating organisations choosing their own theme.Together in Service  Criticism  The Network's openness to dialogue with groups that some orthodox Buddhists regard as controversial has brought it a certain amount of criticism. Although veteran author Ken Jones has praised NBO for its work, he sees certain dangers for it as well: \\"The Network of Buddhist Organisations is performing an invaluable role in opening up dialogue and bringing potential antagonists together in common concerns. Much useful communication takes place off the record, though the Network remains vulnerable to sectarianism.\\" The risk of sectarianism of which he speaks came to the fore in 1998, when the New Kadampa Tradition applied for membership not long after its members had been involved in demonstrations against the Dalai Lama concerning the Dorje Shugden controversy.The Independent 15 July 1996 Several NBO members considered the conduct of the NKT incongruous with the Network's aims. When the NKT's application was accepted, some groups therefore left the NBO including approximately 30% of its Tibetan Buddhist members.Kay, David (2004). Tibetan and Zen Buddhism in Britain: Transplantation, Development and Adaptation. RoutledgeCurzon critical studies in Buddhism. London: RoutledgeCurzon. p. 213. The connection also came under scrutiny when Parliamentary Questions were raised in the UK Parliament, some about the 'new religious movements' among its membership and some concerning what assessment had been made of the NBO's representative status by Government before consulting them. Various short responses to these questions were made by the Government, including: > * The Home Office has made no such assessment. The Network of Buddhist > Organisations is just one of the Buddhist organisations that the Home Office > consults with. * the Network of Buddhist Organisations is a member of > independently formed multi-faith group which the Department maintains close > contact with as part of our commitment to a multi-faith approach to NHS > Chaplaincy. * The Network of Buddhist Organisations is one of the > organisations that the Department consults on relevant issues.

He was born in Castrogiovanni (now known as Enna), Sicily, on the 16 September 1921, the son of a police sergeant, and died at Lugano, Switzerland, on 19 July 1990. For his work, he was awarded the Eunus Prize by the Kiwanis Club of Enna, in 1986.  Writing  A detective novel by Franco Enna Francesco Cannarozzo was a poet, a playwright, a journalist, and a prolific writer of detective novels and science fiction. He was best known as Franco Enna, but also wrote under his true name as well as many English pseudonyms, including Lou Happings, Andrew Maxwell, James Douglas, Thomas Freed, Richard Shell, Lewis Allen Scott, Herry Graham, Max Reditone, and Carlton Gibbs. Much of his work was published in the science fiction magazine Urania.La Voce Dell‚ÄôIsola, January/February 2009,Culture section, page 26 He became very well known among science fiction fans following the publication in Urania of his novel L'astro lebbroso in March 1955. His early detective novels were largely set in foreign locations, but in the 1970s he moved to more familiar Italian locales, notably in Mamma lupara (\\"Mother shotgun\\") published in 1972, and in the series of books about Federico Sartori.Gaetana Marrone: Encyclopedia of Italian literary studies, Volume 1, page 632 Franco Enna came to be known as the writer who \\"provincialised\\" Italian crime fiction. Italo Calvino and Alberto Savinio had said that the Italian countryside could not be the background to a thriller. Enna used the format of a detective novel as an opportunity to show his view of the world. Sicily became the perfect setting to tell stories filled with intrigue and steeped in passion. Enna's best known character was inspector Federico Sartori, a Sicilian police officer plagued by incurable nostalgia, who was led easily by adventure and by love through intricate and compelling stories. Around this character Franco Enna developed a wealth of fictional episodes which had considerable public success and earned him the nickname of \\"the Italian Simenon\\".

This fraction is usually measured as a percentage of all calls. A call attempt invokes a call setup procedure, which, if successful, results in a connected call. A connected call may be terminated (disconnected) due to a technical reason before the parties making the call would wish to do so (in ordinary phone calls this would mean before either of the parties has hung up). Such calls are classified as dropped calls. In many practical cases this definition needs to be further expanded with a number of detailed specifications describing which calls exactly are counted as dropped, at what stage of the call setup procedure a call is counted as connected, etc. In modern telecommunication systems, such as cellular networks, the call setup procedure may be very complex and the point at which a call is considered successfully connected may be defined in a number of ways, thus influencing the way the dropped-call rate is calculated. The dropped-call rate in conventional (land-line) networks is extremely low and is significantly less than 0.01%. In mobile communication systems using radio channels the dropped- call rate is higher and may range for commercial networks between 0.1% and a few percent. The main reasons for dropped calls in mobile networks are lack of radio coverage (either in the downlink or the uplink), radio interference between different subscribers, imperfections in the functioning of the network (such as failed handover or cell-resellection attempts), overload of the different elements of the network (such as cells), etc. The dropped-call rate is one of the key performance indicators (KPI) used by the network operators to assess the performance of their networks. It is assumed to have direct influence on the customer satisfaction with the service provided by the network and its operator. The dropped-call rate is usually included, together with other technical parameters of the network, in a key performance indicator known as call retainability. The operators of telecommunication networks aim at reducing the call dropped rate as much as practical and affordable. In mobile networks this is achieved by improving radio coverage, expanding the capacity of the network and optimising the performance of its elements, all of which may require considerable effort and significant investments on the part of the network operator.  Indian dropped call compensation case  The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has announced a compensation of Re.1 for every call up to a maximum of three calls everyday effect from January 1, 2016. This decision was challenged by telecoms, which lost their case in the Delhi High Court. * Telecoms had argued that the order that penalized them was ‚Äúpopulist‚Äù and unfair because connectivity is affected by factors beyond their control. They also argued that they've spent on installing two lakh telecom towers over the last 15 months. * TRAI, on the other hand, had said that telecoms are earning huge amounts of revenue and can and should expand their investment in infrastructure. The court termed the TRAI notification as ‚Äúflawed, unconstitutional, arbitrary and unreasonable‚Äù. The court was also of the view that a transparent procedure was not followed while evolving it. * The court said the regulation which fastens strict liability on the telecom companies for no fault of theirs is arbitrary and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. * The court also observed that quality of Service Regulations allowed service providers a 2% allowance of call drops on the basis of averaging call drops per month and therefore, the companies cannot be penalised when they were complaint with this norm. * Also, the court said, there is no legal basis or explanation in the 2015 Regulations as to why the compensation has been limited to only three call drops.

The idea influenced the development of quantum key distribution protocols used in quantum cryptography. The idea was put forward in about 1970 by Stephen Wiesner, a graduate student at Columbia University, though it was rejected by a number of scientific journals, meaning that it remained unpublished until 1983. How it works In addition to a unique serial number on each bank note (these notes are actually more like cheques, since a verification step with the bank is required for each transaction), there is a series of isolated two-state quantum systems.Lo, Spiller & Popescu, Introduction to Quantum computation and information (1998) pp. 81‚Äì83 For example, photons in one of four polarizations could be used: at 0¬∞, 45¬∞, 90¬∞ and 135¬∞ to some axis, which is referred to as the vertical. Each of these is a two-state system in one of two bases: the horizontal basis has states with polarizations at 0¬∞ and 90¬∞ to the vertical, and the diagonal basis has states at 45¬∞ and 135¬∞ to the vertical. At the bank, there is a record of all the polarizations and the corresponding serial numbers. On the bank note, the serial number is printed, but the polarizations are kept secret. Thus, whilst the bank can always verify the polarizations by measuring the polarization of each photon in the correct basis without introducing any disturbance, a would-be counterfeiter ignorant of the bases cannot create a copy of the photon polarization states, since even if he knows the two bases, if he chooses the wrong one to measure a photon, it will change the polarization of the photon in the trap, and the forged banknote created will be with this wrong polarization. For each photon, the would-be counterfeiter has a probability 3/4 of success in duplicating it correctly. If the total number of photons on the bank note is N, a duplicate will have probability (3/4)^N of passing the bank's verification test. If N is large, this probability becomes exponentially small. The fact that a quantum state cannot be copied is ultimately guaranteed by its proof by the no-cloning theorem, which underlies the security of this system. Quantum money is not practical to implement with current technology because the quantum bank notes require to store the quantum states in a quantum memory. Quantum memories can currently store quantum states only for a very short time.

Access individual season statistics via Season Stats dropdown menu. Career Punter was born in Waterloo Road, in Wolverhampton, Staffordshire. As a youngster he joined his local club, Wolverhampton Wanderers, for whom he played in the first leg of the FA Youth Cup Final in 1953, which Wolves lost 7‚Äì1 to a Manchester United team containing many of the \\"Busby Babes\\". An ankle injury sustained early on in that game prevented Punter taking part in the second leg, so he was not presented with his runners-up medal at the time. Feeling that \\"it would be nice to have one to show to our grandchildren\\", he eventually applied to the Football Association, and received his medal some 56 years after the event. Punter was selected for the England youth team to play against their Scottish counterparts in February 1953, one of his three international appearances made in the 1952‚Äì53 season. Wolverhampton Wanderers were pioneers of floodlit football in the 1950s, playing friendly matches against top sides from Continental Europe. In the hope of offering better visibility under lights than their traditional old gold kit, they developed a fluorescent shirt, which was tried out in a youth team game. Only a single prototype shirt was initially produced, and Punter, who as a winger would be expected to play near the edge of the pitch and thus be noticeable, was chosen to wear it for the trial. After leaving Wolves, Punter was on the books of Leicester City, but he moved on to Lincoln City without appearing for Leicester's first team. He made his debut on 12 December 1959 in a 1‚Äì0 home defeat to Rotherham United in the Football League Second Division. In the 1960‚Äì61 season, Lincoln finished bottom of their division. The following season, Punter, now playing as a centre forward, was the club's leading scorer, though with only eight goals as they suffered a second consecutive relegation. He repeated the achievement the next season in the Fourth Division, this time with 17 goals in all competitions as Lincoln narrowly avoided having to apply for re-election. Punter played his last game for the club in April 1964. He had remained a semi-professional player for the whole of his five years with Lincoln, while continuing his main career as a design draughtsman. He returned to the Midlands to play for Hereford United of the Southern League, where he remained until at least the 1968‚Äì69 season. He also played for several other Midlands sides, including Kidderminster Harriers, Bromsgrove Rovers, Nuneaton Borough, Stourbridge and Darlaston. In later life, Punter scouted for Wolverhampton Wanderers' Academy.

Each arrow represents one or more signals. Control signals enter from the left and status signals exit on the right; data flows from top to bottom. In computing, an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a combinational digital circuit that performs arithmetic and bitwise operations on integer binary numbers. This is in contrast to a floating-point unit (FPU), which operates on floating point numbers. It is a fundamental building block of many types of computing circuits, including the central processing unit (CPU) of computers, FPUs, and graphics processing units (GPUs). The inputs to an ALU are the data to be operated on, called operands, and a code indicating the operation to be performed; the ALU's output is the result of the performed operation. In many designs, the ALU also has status inputs or outputs, or both, which convey information about a previous operation or the current operation, respectively, between the ALU and external status registers. Signals An ALU has a variety of input and output nets, which are the electrical conductors used to convey digital signals between the ALU and external circuitry. When an ALU is operating, external circuits apply signals to the ALU inputs and, in response, the ALU produces and conveys signals to external circuitry via its outputs. =Data= A basic ALU has three parallel data buses consisting of two input operands (A and B) and a result output (Y). Each data bus is a group of signals that conveys one binary integer number. Typically, the A, B and Y bus widths (the number of signals comprising each bus) are identical and match the native word size of the external circuitry (e.g., the encapsulating CPU or other processor). =Opcode= The opcode input is a parallel bus that conveys to the ALU an operation selection code, which is an enumerated value that specifies the desired arithmetic or logic operation to be performed by the ALU. The opcode size (its bus width) determines the maximum number of different operations the ALU can perform; for example, a four-bit opcode can specify up to sixteen different ALU operations. Generally, an ALU opcode is not the same as a machine language opcode, though in some cases it may be directly encoded as a bit field within a machine language opcode. =Status= Outputs The status outputs are various individual signals that convey supplemental information about the result of the current ALU operation. General-purpose ALUs commonly have status signals such as: * Carry-out, which conveys the carry resulting from an addition operation, the borrow resulting from a subtraction operation, or the overflow bit resulting from a binary shift operation. * Zero, which indicates all bits of Y are logic zero. * Negative, which indicates the result of an arithmetic operation is negative. * Overflow, which indicates the result of an arithmetic operation has exceeded the numeric range of Y. * Parity, which indicates whether an even or odd number of bits in Y are logic one. At the end of each ALU operation, the status output signals are usually stored in external registers to make them available for future ALU operations (e.g., to implement multiple-precision arithmetic) or for controlling conditional branching. The collection of bit registers that store the status outputs are often treated as a single, multi- bit register, which is referred to as the \\"status register\\" or \\"condition code register\\". Inputs The status inputs allow additional information to be made available to the ALU when performing an operation. Typically, this is a single \\"carry-in\\" bit that is the stored carry-out from a previous ALU operation. Circuit operation The combinational logic circuitry of the 74181 integrated circuit, which is a simple four-bit ALU An ALU is a combinational logic circuit, meaning that its outputs will change asynchronously in response to input changes. In normal operation, stable signals are applied to all of the ALU inputs and, when enough time (known as the \\"propagation delay\\") has passed for the signals to propagate through the ALU circuitry, the result of the ALU operation appears at the ALU outputs. The external circuitry connected to the ALU is responsible for ensuring the stability of ALU input signals throughout the operation, and for allowing sufficient time for the signals to propagate through the ALU before sampling the ALU result. In general, external circuitry controls an ALU by applying signals to its inputs. Typically, the external circuitry employs sequential logic to control the ALU operation, which is paced by a clock signal of a sufficiently low frequency to ensure enough time for the ALU outputs to settle under worst-case conditions. For example, a CPU begins an ALU addition operation by routing operands from their sources (which are usually registers) to the ALU's operand inputs, while the control unit simultaneously applies a value to the ALU's opcode input, configuring it to perform addition. At the same time, the CPU also routes the ALU result output to a destination register that will receive the sum. The ALU's input signals, which are held stable until the next clock, are allowed to propagate through the ALU and to the destination register while the CPU waits for the next clock. When the next clock arrives, the destination register stores the ALU result and, since the ALU operation has completed, the ALU inputs may be set up for the next ALU operation. Functions A number of basic arithmetic and bitwise logic functions are commonly supported by ALUs. Basic, general purpose ALUs typically include these operations in their repertoires: =Arithmetic operations= * Add: A and B are summed and the sum appears at Y and carry- out. * Add with carry: A, B and carry-in are summed and the sum appears at Y and carry-out. * Subtract: B is subtracted from A (or vice versa) and the difference appears at Y and carry-out. For this function, carry-out is effectively a \\"borrow\\" indicator. This operation may also be used to compare the magnitudes of A and B; in such cases the Y output may be ignored by the processor, which is only interested in the status bits (particularly zero and negative) that result from the operation. * Subtract with borrow: B is subtracted from A (or vice versa) with borrow (carry-in) and the difference appears at Y and carry-out (borrow out). * Two's complement (negate): A (or B) is subtracted from zero and the difference appears at Y. * Increment: A (or B) is increased by one and the resulting value appears at Y. * Decrement: A (or B) is decreased by one and the resulting value appears at Y. * Pass through: all bits of A (or B) appear unmodified at Y. This operation is typically used to determine the parity of the operand or whether it is zero or negative, or to load the operand into a processor register. =Bitwise logical operations= * AND: the bitwise AND of A and B appears at Y. * OR: the bitwise OR of A and B appears at Y. * Exclusive-OR: the bitwise XOR of A and B appears at Y. * Ones' complement: all bits of A (or B) are inverted and appear at Y. =Bit shift operations= { class=\\"wikitable floatright\\" style=\\"margin-left: 1.5em;\\" + Bit shift examples for an eight-bit ALU !

Simple ALUs typically can shift the operand by only one bit position, whereas more complex ALUs employ barrel shifters that allow them to shift the operand by an arbitrary number of bits in one operation. In all single-bit shift operations, the bit shifted out of the operand appears on carry-out; the value of the bit shifted into the operand depends on the type of shift. * Arithmetic shift: the operand is treated as a two's complement integer, meaning that the most significant bit is a \\"sign\\" bit and is preserved. * Logical shift: a logic zero is shifted into the operand. This is used to shift unsigned integers. * Rotate: the operand is treated as a circular buffer of bits so its least and most significant bits are effectively adjacent. * Rotate through carry: the carry bit and operand are collectively treated as a circular buffer of bits. Applications =Multiple-precision arithmetic= In integer arithmetic computations, multiple-precision arithmetic is an algorithm that operates on integers which are larger than the ALU word size. To do this, the algorithm treats each operand as an ordered collection of ALU-size fragments, arranged from most-significant (MS) to least-significant (LS) or vice versa. For example, in the case of an 8-bit ALU, the 24-bit integer \`0x123456\` would be treated as a collection of three 8-bit fragments: \`0x12\` (MS), \`0x34\`, and \`0x56\` (LS). Since the size of a fragment exactly matches the ALU word size, the ALU can directly operate on this \\"piece\\" of operand. The algorithm uses the ALU to directly operate on particular operand fragments and thus generate a corresponding fragment (a \\"partial\\") of the multi-precision result. Each partial, when generated, is written to an associated region of storage that has been designated for the multiple-precision result. This process is repeated for all operand fragments so as to generate a complete collection of partials, which is the result of the multiple-precision operation. In arithmetic operations (e.g., addition, subtraction), the algorithm starts by invoking an ALU operation on the operands' LS fragments, thereby producing both a LS partial and a carry out bit. The algorithm writes the partial to designated storage, whereas the processor's state machine typically stores the carry out bit to an ALU status register. The algorithm then advances to the next fragment of each operand's collection and invokes an ALU operation on these fragments along with the stored carry bit from the previous ALU operation, thus producing another (more significant) partial and a carry out bit. As before, the carry bit is stored to the status register and the partial is written to designated storage. This process repeats until all operand fragments have been processed, resulting in a complete collection of partials in storage, which comprise the multi- precision arithmetic result. In multiple-precision shift operations, the order of operand fragment processing depends on the shift direction. In left-shift operations, fragments are processed LS first because the LS bit of each partial‚Äîwhich is conveyed via the stored carry bit‚Äîmust be obtained from the MS bit of the previously left-shifted, less-significant operand. Conversely, operands are processed MS first in right-shift operations because the MS bit of each partial must be obtained from the LS bit of the previously right- shifted, more-significant operand. In bitwise logical operations (e.g., logical AND, logical OR), the operand fragments may be processed in any arbitrary order because each partial depends only on the corresponding operand fragments (the stored carry bit from the previous ALU operation is ignored). =Complex operations= Although an ALU can be designed to perform complex functions, the resulting higher circuit complexity, cost, power consumption and larger size makes this impractical in many cases. Consequently, ALUs are often limited to simple functions that can be executed at very high speeds (i.e., very short propagation delays), and the external processor circuitry is responsible for performing complex functions by orchestrating a sequence of simpler ALU operations. For example, computing the square root of a number might be implemented in various ways, depending on ALU complexity: * Calculation in a single clock: a very complex ALU that calculates a square root in one operation. * Calculation pipeline: a group of simple ALUs that calculates a square root in stages, with intermediate results passing through ALUs arranged like a factory production line. This circuit can accept new operands before finishing the previous ones and produces results as fast as the very complex ALU, though the results are delayed by the sum of the propagation delays of the ALU stages. For more information, see the article on instruction pipelining. * Iterative calculation: a simple ALU that calculates the square root through several steps under the direction of a control unit. The implementations above transition from fastest and most expensive to slowest and least costly. The square root is calculated in all cases, but processors with simple ALUs will take longer to perform the calculation because multiple ALU operations must be performed. Implementation An ALU is usually implemented either as a stand-alone integrated circuit (IC), such as the 74181, or as part of a more complex IC. In the latter case, an ALU is typically instantiated by synthesizing it from a description written in VHDL, Verilog or some other hardware description language. For example, the following VHDL code describes a very simple 8-bit ALU: entity alu is port ( -- the alu connections to external circuitry: A : in signed(7 downto 0); -- operand A B : in signed(7 downto 0); -- operand B OP : in unsigned(2 downto 0); -- opcode Y : out signed(7 downto 0)); -- operation result end alu; architecture behavioral of alu is begin case OP is -- decode the opcode and perform the operation: when \\"000\\" => Y <= A + B; -- add when \\"001\\" => Y <= A - B; -- subtract when \\"010\\" => Y <= A - 1; -- decrement when \\"011\\" => Y <= A + 1; -- increment when \\"100\\" => Y <= not A; -- 1's complement when \\"101\\" => Y <= A and B; -- bitwise AND when \\"110\\" => Y <= A or B; -- bitwise OR when \\"111\\" => Y <= A xor B; -- bitwise XOR when others => Y <= (others => 'X'); end case; end behavioral;  History  Mathematician John von Neumann proposed the ALU concept in 1945 in a report on the foundations for a new computer called the EDVAC. The cost, size, and power consumption of electronic circuitry was relatively high throughout the infancy of the information age. Consequently, all serial computers and many early computers, such as the PDP-8, had a simple ALU that operated on one data bit at a time, although they often presented a wider word size to programmers. One of the earliest computers to have multiple discrete single-bit ALU circuits was the 1948 Whirlwind I, which employed sixteen of such \\"math units\\" to enable it to operate on 16-bit words. In 1967, Fairchild introduced the first ALU implemented as an integrated circuit, the Fairchild 3800, consisting of an eight-bit ALU with accumulator. Other integrated-circuit ALUs soon emerged, including four-bit ALUs such as the Am2901 and 74181. These devices were typically \\"bit slice\\" capable, meaning they had \\"carry look ahead\\" signals that facilitated the use of multiple interconnected ALU chips to create an ALU with a wider word size. These devices quickly became popular and were widely used in bit-slice minicomputers. Microprocessors began to appear in the early 1970s. Even though transistors had become smaller, there was often insufficient die space for a full-word-width ALU and, as a result, some early microprocessors employed a narrow ALU that required multiple cycles per machine language instruction. Examples of this includes the popular Zilog Z80, which performed eight-bit additions with a four-bit ALU. Ken Shirriff. \\"The Z-80 has a 4-bit ALU. Here's how it works.\\" 2013, righto.com Over time, transistor geometries shrank further, following Moore's law, and it became feasible to build wider ALUs on microprocessors. Modern integrated circuit (IC) transistors are orders of magnitude smaller than those of the early microprocessors, making it possible to fit highly complex ALUs on ICs. Today, many modern ALUs have wide word widths, and architectural enhancements such as barrel shifters and binary multipliers that allow them to perform, in a single clock cycle, operations that would have required multiple operations on earlier ALUs. ALUs can be realized as mechanical, electro-mechanical or electronic circuits and, in recent years, research into biological ALUs has been carried out (e.g., actin- based).

Along with Field Marshal Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig, Lister was a leading advocate for the foundation of the British Legion in the aftermath of the First World War. Early life Lister was born in Manchester, the son of insurance surveyor Thomas Lister. He was educated at Tranmere higher grade school, and worked as insurance clerk in Liverpool. He was a tall man, some 6 feet 6 inches tall. He married Isobel Lewis, daughter of a shipping clerk, on 31 July 1911. They had no children. First World War When the First World War broke out in 1914, Lister joined the Royal Garrison Artillery, becoming a lance- bombardier. He was wounded and discharged in 1916. At the time, there was little assistance for disabled veterans, and Lister joined the National Federation of Discharged and Demobilized Sailors and Soldiers (formed in 1917 to campaign against the Military Service (Review of Exceptions) Act 1917, which was intended to re-conscript men formerly discharged on medical grounds). Early veterans organisations were split on largely political lines. Post-war career The National Federation had links with the Liberal Party, and its first president was a Liberal MP James Hogge. The National Association of Discharged Sailors and Soldiers was linked with the Labour Party and trades unions; and the Comrades of the Great War was supported by the Conservative Party. The non-partisan Officers Association split the veterans movements further. Lister was the National Federation's candidate in the December 1918 general election, in the Ashton-under-Lyne constituency. Lister received over 7,300 votes (over 40% of the votes cast), but lost to the Coalition Unionist candidate, Albert Stanley. After the Federation's poor showing at the election, Lister replaced Hogge as its president. Field Marshal Earl Haig pushed for the competing veterans organisations to unify, supported by Lister. The Federation invited the other organizations to a conference in August 1920, and a series of meetings in 1920 and 1921 resulted in the amalgamation of the various groups into the new British Legion in July 1921, with Lister elected as its first chairman and Haig as its first president. Lister remained chairman of the British Legion until 1927. He continued as an active member of the British Legion's national executive council until his death in 1966. He was also chairman of the United Services Fund from 1942-48. He was appointed CBE in the 1927 Birthday Honours and knighted in the 1961 New Year Honours. Lister combined his duties with the British Legion with a full-time job as the accident department manager of an insurance company. He died at his home in Birkenhead, aged 79.

The first establishment on the site, an inn built in 1738, was relatively small. This was followed by several other buildings of increasing size and varied design as the site changed from family ownership to being run by a limited company. Some of the rebuilding or extension work took place following fires that by 1888 had destroyed most of the original buildings. At various times architects were commissioned to build grand new buildings or extensions to take advantage of the famed view over the river and valley below, with the largest being the 1860s chateau block by E. M. Barry. The hotel reached the peak of its fame as Richmond itself expanded in the 19th century during the Victorian era. In the period from the 1830s to the 1890s, the hotel guests ranged from literary figures such as Charles Dickens to exiled crowned heads of Europe such as King Louis-Philippe and his wife. The hotel's reputation spread to other countries, with guests arriving from the USA and Europe, or travelling by horse and carriage from London to visit the area and stay at the hotel. In the later years of the 19th century, the hotel and its concert hall, banquet hall, and gardens were used for public dinners, fetes and fundraising gatherings, often attended by local grandees and members of the royal family. Following the end of the Victorian era, the rise of the motor car and more widespread travel led to a decline in the hotel's fortunes, and it failed twice to be sold at auction. During World War I it was purchased by the Auctioneers and Estate Agents Institute and donated to Queen Mary in 1916 in support of her plans to establish a home for paralysed and permanently disabled soldiers. The hotel buildings were demolished and rebuilt as a care home beginning in 1919; the new building was dedicated in 1924 as the Women of the Empire's Memorial of the Great War. Early years During the 18th century Richmond and its surroundings were mostly still countryside and parkland with several villas and estates along the River Thames, together with scattered villages and towns. The land on which the Star and Garter Hotel was later built was owned by the Earl of Dysart and is located on the river-facing side of Richmond Hill, next to the Richmond Gates of Richmond Park (enclosed 1637) and overlooking Petersham Common, an area of grazing meadows and common land between the hill and the river. The land, initially only enough for the building of a small inn in 1738, was leased from the Earl by a John Christopher (died 1758). This inn bore the name \\"Star and Garter\\", an allusion to the insignia of the Order of the Garter that was and still is common among inns and hotels around Britain.The Original ‚ÄòStar and Garter‚Äô, Richmond Hill, Local History Notes, Richmond Libraries' Local Studies Collection, accessed 19 April 2010 Little is known about the subsequent early history other than a rebuilding of the inn, but in the year 1780 a private residence that had been built next to the inn became part of what could now be called a hotel, though it was also referred to as an inn or tavern. In the early 19th century, the establishment went through three owners starting with a Richard Brewer who leased more land from the Earl of Dysart in 1803. An idea of the value of the site can be ascertained from the rental value for the new land of 60 shillings per year. However, Brewer's management and expansion of the hotel left him over-extended financially and he was declared bankrupt and died in a debtors' prison in 1808. The hotel then passed into the hands of a Christopher Crean who made changes and reopened the hotel in 1809. Prices, said to be half a sovereign to \\"look through a window\\", were considered \\"exorbitant\\". Following Crean's death in 1815, his widow continued to run the property, though with a mortgage of ¬£4000. It was the need to pay off this mortgage that led to the hotel being sold in 1822, when it was purchased by a Joseph Ellis for ¬£11,022. Ellis family ownership The Ellis family would own the hotel for over 40 years, making several enlargements to the property. It was during this time that the hotel became widely known in London as it established itself as \\"a fashionable resort of London society, who used to drive out from town for luncheon or dinner\\".London and Its Environs, 1927, by Findlay Muirhead, 1927 One of those who stayed regularly at the hotel was the author Charles Dickens. He and his wife and his friend and biographer John Forster spent the day there on the Sunday in March 1838 when the first installments of Nicholas Nickleby were to be published. The occasion also coincided with the time of the year for Dickens' birthday and marriage anniversary, and a tradition developed and continued for 20 years to celebrate these events at the Star and Garter Hotel if they were in the country at the time. The hotel was said to be a \\"favourite resort\\" of Dickens, and he would meet friends there, or recover there after strenuous bouts of writing. Other events were held by Dickens at the Star and Garter, including a dinner in 1844 to mark the birth of his third son, and a famous dinner in 1850 that celebrated the start of the publication of David Copperfield. Guests at the latter dinner included Alfred, Lord Tennyson and William Thackeray.Dickens in Richmond upon Thames, Local History Notes, Richmond Libraries' Local Studies Collection, accessed 19 April 2010 Other dinners and meetings, held by societies and private individuals, took place at the hotel during the period of the Ellis family ownership, with some of them being reported in The Times, the leading newspaper of the day. These dinners included a banquet held in 1846 by the Irish Society to mark the Earl of Lincoln retiring from the post of Chief Secretary for Ireland,The Times, Thursday, 2 July 1846; pg. 5; Issue 19278; col E a public dinner in 1847 for The Scottish Hospital, a charity known today as the Royal Scottish Corporation,The Times, Thursday, 6 May 1847; pg. 3; Issue 19542; col F and a dinner hosted in June 1855 by the American entrepreneur and philanthropist George Peabody for Millard Fillmore, ex-President of the United States.Millard Fillmore Papers, 1833-1874, Correspondence and Memorandum as U.S. President, 1850-1855, \\"A Dinner Given by Mr. Peabody at the Star and Garter [Hotel], Richmond [London], to the Honorable Millard Fillmore, Late President of the United States\\", 25 June 1855\\", accessed 21 April 2010 Among the most prestigious and celebrated events during this period was the stay at the hotel of the ex-Royal Family of France in 1848. Then known as the Count and Countess de Neuilly, and formerly Louis-Philippe I, King of the French and his queen Maria Amalia of Naples and Sicily, the couple and their entourage stayed at the Star and Garter while Maria recovered from the effects of the water at Claremont House. The family had been staying at Claremont following their arrival in the country in exile after the revolution in France. The stay at the hotel was several months long while the water pipes at Claremont were replaced, and the group consisted of 88 people occupying between 50 and 60 apartments.The Times, Saturday, 18 November 1848; pg. 5; Issue 20024; col CThe Times, Monday, 29 January 1849; pg. 4; Issue 20085; col F The presence of these \\"illustrious exiles\\" in the area led to a visit in 1850 by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.

The company was run by a board of directors, while day-to-day running of the establishment was entrusted to a hotel manager. One of the major changes made was a large expansion by the building of a grand chateau-like building, designed by the architect Edward Middleton Barry, and the addition of a banqueting hall. These additions were completed by 1865, but were not universally well-received, with one critic describing the new building as a \\"wen\\" on the face of the hill. During this period, dinners held here included the inaugural dinner in July 1866 of the Cobden Club, formed in memory of Richard Cobden, with a speech given by William Gladstone, a meeting in July 1866 that led to the formation of the world's first canoe club the Royal Canoe Club,The history of the Royal Canoe Club, The Royal Canoe Club, accessed 21 April 2010 the ninth Cholmeleian Society dinner in 1868,The Times, Saturday, 30 May 1868; pg. 3; Issue 26138; col A the annual dinner in 1868 of the officers of the 91st Argyllshire Highlanders,The Times, Friday, 5 June 1868; pg. 12; Issue 26143; col F and another dinner in 1868 held by the Fishmongers' Company.The Times, Tuesday, 14 July 1868; pg. 12; Issue 26176; col A The hotel continued to attract royalty and aristocracy, with The Times reporting in 1869 the stay at the hotel of Prince Ludwig August of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and his wife Princess Leopoldina of Brazil and their three children.

In 1888, another fire destroyed the coffee rooms, which had been the last remnant of the pre-1864 buildings. Late Victorian era During the following decades (the late 1870s to 1890s), numerous functions and charity and society dinners were held at the hotel.

The stadium features eight courts, including two basketball show courts with 1,100 permanent seats and 900 retractable seats, and a six-court sports hall with multi-sport line markings. Facilities cater primarily for basketball, in addition to netball, volleyball and badminton. The stadium also holds a function room on the first floor for up to 270 people, with bar and kitchen facilities. The stadium houses the offices of Basketball Western Australia, Perry Lakes Basketball Association, and the Perth Wildcats. The facility is the main training base of the Wildcats, home court of the Perth Lynx, and hosts countless state, junior and social games throughout the year. History In 2008, construction started at AK Reserve in Mount Claremont on new athletics and basketball facilities to replace the crumbling former Commonwealth Games facilities at Perry Lakes. Being built across the road from the old Perry Lakes Athletics Stadium and Perry Lakes Basketball Stadium, the new facilities would join the sports precinct which was already home to Perth Superdrome (more commonly known as Challenge Stadium), the Western Australian Institute of Sport, and UWA Sports Park. While the WA Athletics Stadium opened in 2009, the WA Basketball Centre was officially opened on 24 January 2010. The combined construction cost of the WA Athletics Stadium, WA Basketball Centre and supporting infrastructure was $73 million, with the basketball facilities costing approximately $40 million. The WA Rugby Centre later joined the precinct on adjacent land. On 1 October 2014, Basketball Western Australia took on the day-to-day operations of the stadium under a co-management agreement with VenuesWest, with VenuesWest continuing to maintain the facility after being the sole operator since its opening. On 6 May 2015, the stadium was renamed Bendat Basketball Centre in a 21-year sponsorship agreement in honour of Perth Wildcats owner Dr. Jack Bendat. On 23 March 2020, the stadium was closed to the public indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The stadium was reopened on 25 May 2020, initially in a limited capacity.

This fraction is usually measured as a percentage of all call attempts made. In telecommunications a call attempt invokes a call setup procedure, which, if successful, results in a connected call. A call setup procedure may fail due to a number of technical reasons. Such calls are classified as failed call attempts. In many practical cases this definition needs to be further expanded with a number of detailed specifications describing which calls exactly are counted as successfully set up and which not. This is determined to a great degree by the stage of the call setup procedure at which a call is counted as connected. In modern telecommunication systems, such as cellular (mobile) networks, the call setup procedure maybe very complex and the point at which a call is considered successfully connected may be defined in a number of ways, thus influencing the way the call setup success rate is calculated. If a call is connected successfully but the dialled number is busy, the call is counted as successful. Another term, used to denote call attempts which fail during the call setup procedure, is blocked calls. The call setup success rate in conventional (so-called land- line) networks is extremely high and is significantly above 99.9%. In mobile communication systems using radio channels the call setup success rate is lower and may range for commercial networks between 90% and 98% or higher. The main reasons for unsuccessful call setups in mobile networks are lack of radio coverage (either in the downlink or the uplink), radio interference between different subscribers, imperfections in the functioning of the network (such as failed call setup redirect procedures), overload of the different elements of the network (such as cells), etc. The call setup success rate is one of the key performance indicators (KPI) used by the network operators to assess the performance of their networks. It is assumed to have direct influence on the customer satisfaction with the service provided by the network and its operator. The call setup success rate is usually included, together with other technical parameters of the network, in a key performance indicator known as service accessibility. The operators of telecommunication networks aim at increasing the call setup success rate as much as practical and affordable. In mobile networks this is achieved by improving radio coverage, expanding the capacity of the network and optimising the performance of its elements, all of which may require considerable effort and significant investments on the part of the network operator.

The collections belong to Gothenburg University Library. History The Kvinnohistoriskt arkiv (Women's History Archive) was established in 1958 by two librarians who were working at the Gothenburg City Library, Asta Ekenvall and , along with the chair of the Fredrika Bremer Association in Gothenburg, Eva Pin√©us. Established as a self-supporting, private archive the women hoped to preserve archival materials, create and maintain a record of current research into women's history, and provide a publishing mechanism for materials on women's history and issues. Ekenvall contacted prominent women throughout Sweden asking them to donate materials for the archive and some of her earliest acquisitions included letters and diaries by Barbro Alving, Emilia Fogelklou, and Elin W√§gner, among others. The first publication produced by the Archive was Malmstr√∂m's Kvinnliga pr√§ster, bibliografi √∂ver i Sverige tryckt litteratur (Female Priests, bibliography of literature printed in Sweden, 1958). In 1972, Ekenvall, who at the time was chief librarian at the Gothenburg University Library, transferred the archive into the care of Gothenburg University. The university renamed the collection the Kvinnohistoriska samlingarna (Women's History Collections) and hired a half- time librarian to manage the records. Since 2010, the KvinnSam has been called the National National Library for Gender Research and is the largest collection of gender-related research in the Nordic countries. Five full-time librarians work to manage the collection, preserving and digitizing archival materials. The library collects and organizes material on gender issues. This includes everything from academic theses to small leaflets and debate articles. The collections also comprise a manuscript collection with texts and photographs. Parts of these have been digitized and are now freely available on the Internet. A wide range of women's journals, from the 19th century onwards, are also digitized. KvinnSam produces four databases: *KVINNSAM is the largest database on gender research in the Nordic countries. It contains more than 140,000 itemsThe Database KVINNSAM *GENA (GENusAvhandlingar) is a database of PhD-theses in Women's Studies, Men's Studies and Gender Research in Sweden, from 1960 onwards. *GREDA (Gender Researchers Database) contains presentations of Swedish gender researchers. *J√ÑMDA (J√§mst√§lldhetsdatabasen) is the newest database, launched in December 2009.

The bot is typically installed on infected machines by a Trojan component called Pushdo. It affects computers running Microsoft Windows. History In June 2009 it was estimated that the Cutwail botnet was the largest botnet in terms of the amount of infected hosts. Security provider MessageLabs estimated that the total size of the botnet was around 1.5 to 2 million individual computers, capable of sending 74 billion spam messages a day, or 51 million every minute, equal to 46.5% of the worldwide spam volume. In February 2010 the botnet's activities were slightly altered when it started a DDoS attack against 300 major sites, including the CIA, FBI, Twitter and PayPal. The reasons for this attack weren't fully understood, and some experts described it as an \\"accident\\", mainly due to the lack of damage and disruption, along with the infrequency of the attacks. In August 2010, researchers from University of California, Santa Barbara and Ruhr University Bochum attempted to take down the botnet, and managed to take offline 20 of the 30 Command and Control servers that the botnet was using. Structure Cutwail is a fairly simple botnet. The bots connect directly to the command and control server, and receive instructions about the emails they should send. After they are done with their task, the bots report back to the spammer exact statistics on the number of emails that were delivered, and on which and how many errors were reported. Operations The Cutwail botnet is known as \\"0bulk Psyche Evolution\\" in the underground market. Spammers can rent an instance of the botnet for a fee, and use it to send their own spam campaigns. The services offered by the botnet were advertised on the Russian underground forum \\"spamdot.biz\\", that was taken down in 2010. As of June 2010, at least 8 different spam groups were using the botnet to deliver junk mail.

It was written in 1919 (11-29 August), originally for solo piano, and later orchestrated.

According to 2010 news accounts, it is operated by the Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad (RBMN or often called the nickname 'Reading and Northern') which may have renamed the yard the Muller yard as this 'new' sign indicates as the track crosses Coxton Road in Duryea and enters the northern tip of the yard's entrance wye along the shore of the Lackawanna River. Duryea YardAlthough the 2017 RBM&N; System Map names Duryea yard as such, in July 2013 a newly hung sign (See photo at right.) indicates RBM&N; had renamed Duryea Yard as \\"Muller yard.\\" (formerly Coxton Yard, sometimes Pittston Junction, or West Pittston Yard) is a railroad yard in the Wyoming Valley region of Northeastern Pennsylvania currently operated by the Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad. Originally constructed in 1870 by the Lehigh Valley Railroad as a turn-around and staging hub for coal transport from the \\"Coal Region\\" to Eastern big-city markets, the yard remains a hub for the energy extraction industry today (). History = Founding = While chartered in 1846, construction of the Lehigh Valley Railroad (LVRR) was delayed for lack of investment subscriptions until into the early 1850s, when the energetic businessman Asa Packer was elected to the board of managers. The LVRR was conceived with the idea of attempting to break the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company's (LC&N; Co.) monopoly over bulk goods shipping on the Wyoming Valley-Lehigh-Delaware route, which was dominated by the Lehigh Canal from White Haven down river to Easton. The LVRR initially connected at Mauch Chunk to the Beaver Meadows Railroad and extended to cross the Delaware just above Easton into Phillipsburg, NJ where it connected to the Morris Canal, the Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ) and two smaller railroads. This gave the LVRR passenger traffic from Philadelphia and Trenton and points south, from New York City and rail connected New England communities, and freight traffic to and from all connected partners. Even before expanding northward to reach Wilkes-Barre, the LVRR had become the trunk line for shipping by rail in the entire Lehigh Valley; shortly after purchasing the Penn Haven and White Haven Railroad, the LVRR completed its line to Wilkes-Barre in 1868. At that time, all industrial activity was powered in some form by coal, and the Wilkes- Barre/Scranton area was a center of the coal mining industry. The LVRR and its competitors expanded rapidly, and the LVRR needed a yard to handle the traffic. That yard was Duryea yard. = 20th century = Duryea yard remained busy during the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th. Following World War II, large dump trucks began to supplant rail for bulk coal hauling. Furthermore, rail companies began to dieselize to cut costs and remain competitive as the Interstate Highway System provided a novel form of highly subsidized competition. Even though the shift to interstate highways was somewhat delayed in the mountainous Eastern Pennsylvania terrain, the shift to diesel was already eliminating much of the LVRR's revenues. Ironically, the railroad's steadiest profits came from carrying the cement and steel products necessary to build the interstate highways. The Duryea railyard declined as I-81 finally came to Scranton and airline travel began to compete with railroads on the few products that needed to be shipped faster than by truck. By the start of the 21st century, Duryea yard was mostly unused. = 21st century = In late 2009 and early 2010, The Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad expanded operations due to the emergence of Marcellus Shale natural gas drilling in northeastern Pennsylvania. The Reading & Northern Railroad spent $100,000 to transform the Pittston Yard to a sand transloading facility to transfer sand from rail cars to trucks, which is then used by natural gas well drillers in the Marcellus Shale region. The upgrades to the railyard included laying new track to accommodate 100 new rail cars and constructing a facility to store and hold up to 800 cars of sand to be used in fracking at Marcellus Shale drill sites throughout Northeastern Pennsylvania.\\"Old Duryea railroad yard taking on new life\\" Geography The yard lies in the borough of Duryea, a bedroom neighborhood of Pittston, itself a secondary community of Wilkes-Barre and Scranton so part of the Wilkes- Barre/Scranton metropolitan area. Physically, the yard is located on the main branch of the Susquehanna River and in the peninsula formed by the confluence of the Lackawanna. 500pxthumbSouth entrance of Duryea yard and environs. At -B- both northbound mainlines are of equal height; running further northeast, the more northerly track to Mountain Top flies over the more southerly one to Scranton. Both elevations are well below Main St. at '-C-', the underpass below Coxton Road. Coxton Road leads immediately to some light industry, but, then, herded by Campbell's Ledge, parallels the yard and subsequent northbound main. The main Wyoming Valley entrance is through a railyard wye to the mainline, running westbound on both sides of the Susquehanna and eastbound to Mountain Top. Historically, the wye was doubled and connected to a long staging (transfer) track, but only parts of the doubling remain (see map at right). Continuing into the yard from the wye is to cross a bridge built for four tracks, although now only supporting three. This lead historically contained several crossovers fanning out to various service tracks and buildings within the yard. On the north side, the yard connects to the LVRR's northbound main to Sayre, Pennsylvania.

It was the 16th typhoon to be named in the 2001 Pacific typhoon season. Meteorological history Impact Flood in Taipei. Striking two months after Taiwan's second deadliest typhoon, Toraji, Nari brought torrential rainfall to much of the island. Numerous landslides triggered by the storm's rain destroyed homes and buried people. At least 94 people were killed on the island due to the storm and 10 others were listed as missing. Agricultural losses from Nari were estimated at NT$2.9 billion (US$84 million). In mountainous regions, more than of rain fell over a two-day span, leading to many rivers overflowing their banks. On September 17, some areas recorded a record-breaking during a single day, equivalent to four months of rain in Taiwan. At the height of the storm, an estimated 650,000 people were without power and 350,000 lost their water and telephone service. Most of the fatalities took place around the city of Taipei and nearby counties. The metro system in the city was severely damaged by floods and was not expected to be working for at least six months. Aftermath In response to the severe damage, the Taiwanese government deployed roughly 8,000 soldiers to assist in search-and-rescue operations across the island. Nearly 10,000 people in northern and central Taiwan were relocated to shelters set up across the region. Already suffering from an economic downturn from the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States, the economy of Taiwan was severely affected by Nari. Businesses across the island were shut down and the stock exchange was closed for several days. Moreover, after it reopened, there was significantly less stock activity as hundreds of thousands of residents were either unable to get to work or were hampered by travel issues.

An EcoDisc is a patented type of DVD which is thinner than a conventional DVD because it is made from a single layer of polycarbonate instead of two layers glued together. Because it contains less material, its manufacture produces only around half of the carbon dioxide of a conventional DVD, and the absence of a non-biodegradable toxic glue layer makes it easier to recycle. Ecodiscs are prone to breakage (accidental or otherwise) since they are, as of May 2011, much less stiff than regular discs. EcoDisc Technology AG licences manufacturers of the discs, and also holds the rights to the EcoDisc logo. The discs are used for covermounts by magazine publishers because their flexibility makes them less prone to damage during handling and transportation than rigid conventional DVDs and shipping costs are reduced because of their lower weight. The maximum capacity of the discs is 4.7 GB, as of February 2011 double layer 8.5 GB capacity is not available. Although earlier versions of the EcoDisc occasionally showed problems with Slot-In drives (especially with those of Apple's MacBook), these problems have since been remedied.

Location The church is located in the northeastern corner of the old city, just inside the eastern wall, between the Irodotou and Apostolou Pavlou streets. History and description The church's name, \\"Saint Nicholas the Orphan\\", is first attested in the 17th and 18th centuries, and presumably refers to its otherwise unknown ktetor (founder). From its interior decoration, the building is dated to the period 1310‚Äì1320. The church originally formed part of a monastery, traces of which (remnants of a gate) survive to the east. Interior view of the church with the well preserved frescoes The church was originally built as a simple, single-aisled edifice with a wooden gabled roof. Later, aisles were added on three sides. They form an ambulatory, under whose floor several graves have been found. The masonry features irregular layers of brick and stone, with a few ceramics on the eastern side and brick decoration on the eastern and western sides. In the interior, the central aisle is connected to the others with double openings decorated with reused late antique capitals. The church's original marble templon survives. The church is most notable for its frescoes, contemporary with the church's construction, which cover almost the entire interior surface. The frescoes are an example of the Thessalonican school at the height of the \\"Palaiologan Renaissance\\", and their creator may be the same who decorated the Hilandar monastery in Mount Athos in 1314. The church has been linked to the Serbian king Stephen Uro≈° II Milutin (r. 1282‚Äì1321), who is known to have sponsored churches in the city, on account of the depiction in the main aisle of St George Gorgos, the Serbian ruler's patron saint, and of St. Clemens of Ohrid, a favourite motif of the Serbian churches. The monastery continued functioning throughout the Ottoman period. The frescoes were uncovered in 1957‚Äì1960 during restoration works.

The U.S. federal government estimated the total discharge at . After several failed efforts to contain the flow, the well was declared sealed on September 19, 2010. Reports in early 2012 indicated that the well site was still leaking. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill is regarded as one of the largest environmental disasters in American history. A massive response ensued to protect beaches, wetlands and estuaries from the spreading oil utilizing skimmer ships, floating booms, controlled burns and of oil dispersant. Due to the months-long spill, along with adverse effects from the response and cleanup activities, extensive damage to marine and wildlife habitats and fishing and tourism industries was reported. In Louisiana, of oily material was removed from the beaches in 2013, over double the amount collected in 2012. Oil cleanup crews worked four days a week on of Louisiana shoreline throughout 2013. Oil continued to be found as far from the Macondo site as the waters off the Florida Panhandle and Tampa Bay, where scientists said the oil and dispersant mixture is embedded in the sand. In April 2013, it was reported that dolphins and other marine life continued to die in record numbers with infant dolphins dying at six times the normal rate. One study released in 2014 reported that tuna and amberjack that were exposed to oil from the spill developed deformities of the heart and other organs that would be expected to be fatal or at least life-shortening and another study found that cardiotoxicity might have been widespread in animal life exposed to the spill. Numerous investigations explored the causes of the explosion and record- setting spill. The U.S. Government report, published in September 2011, pointed to defective cement on the well, faulting mostly BP, but also rig operator Transocean and contractor Halliburton. Earlier in 2011, a White House commission likewise blamed BP and its partners for a series of cost cutting decisions and an inadequate safety system, but also concluded that the spill resulted from \\"systemic\\" root causes and \\"absent significant reform in both industry practices and government policies, might well recur\\". In November 2012, BP and the United States Department of Justice settled federal criminal charges, with BP pleading guilty to 11 counts of manslaughter, two misdemeanors, and a felony count of lying to Congress. BP also agreed to four years of government monitoring of its safety practices and ethics, and the Environmental Protection Agency announced that BP would be temporarily banned from new contracts with the US government. BP and the Department of Justice agreed to a record-setting $4.525 billion in fines and other payments. , cleanup costs, charges and penalties had cost the company more than $65 billion. In September 2014, a U.S. District Court judge ruled that BP was primarily responsible for the oil spill because of its gross negligence and reckless conduct. In July 2015, BP agreed to pay $18.7 billion in fines, the largest corporate settlement in United States history.  Background  =Deepwater Horizon drilling rig= Deepwater Horizon prior to explosion. The Deepwater Horizon was a 10-year-old semi-submersible, mobile, floating, dynamically positioned drilling rig that could operate in waters up to deep. Built by South Korean company Hyundai Heavy Industries and owned by Transocean, the rig operated under the Marshallese flag of convenience, and was chartered to BP from March 2008 to September 2013. It was drilling a deep exploratory well, below sea level, in approximately of water. The well is situated in the Macondo Prospect in Mississippi Canyon Block 252 (MC252) of the Gulf of Mexico, in the United States' exclusive economic zone. The Macondo well is found roughly off the Louisiana coast. BP was the operator and principal developer of the Macondo Prospect with a 65% share, while 25% was owned by Anadarko Petroleum, and 10% by MOEX Offshore 2007, a unit of Mitsui. =Explosion= Supply boats continued to battle the fire, viewed from a Coast Guard helicopter At approximately , on April 20, 2010, high-pressure methane gas from the well expanded into the marine riser and rose into the drilling rig, where it ignited and exploded, engulfing the platform. Eleven missing workers were never found despite a three-day U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) search operation and are believed to have died in the explosion. Ninety-four crew members were rescued by lifeboat or helicopter, 17 of whom were treated for injuries. The Deepwater Horizon sank on the morning of April 22, 2010.  Volume and extent of oil spill  Oil from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill approaches the coast of Mobile, Alabama, 6 May 2010Oil stained beaches in Pensacola, Florida; 1 July 2010 Burning and skimming operations in the Gulf of Mexico; 10 June 2010 Thick oil washes ashore in Louisiana; 10 June 2010 The oil leak was discovered on the afternoon of April 22, 2010 when a large oil slick began to spread at the former rig site. The oil flowed for 87 days. BP originally estimated a flow rate of . The Flow Rate Technical Group (FRTG) estimated the initial flow rate was . The total estimated volume of leaked oil approximated with plus or minus 10% uncertainty, including oil that was collected, making it the world's largest accidental spill. BP challenged the higher figure, saying that the government overestimated the volume. Internal emails released in 2013 showed that one BP employee had estimates that matched those of the FRTG, and shared the data with supervisors, but BP continued with their lower number. The company argued that government figures do not reflect over of oil that was collected or burned before it could enter the Gulf waters. According to the satellite images, the spill directly affected of ocean, which is comparable to the size of Oklahoma. By early June 2010, oil had washed up on of Louisiana's coast and along the Mississippi, Florida, and Alabama coastlines. Oil sludge appeared in the Intracoastal Waterway and on Pensacola Beach and the Gulf Islands National Seashore. In late June, oil reached Gulf Park Estates, its first appearance in Mississippi. In July, tar balls reached Grand Isle and the shores of Lake Pontchartrain. In September a new wave of oil suddenly coated of Louisiana coastline and marshes west of the Mississippi River in Plaquemines Parish. In October, weathered oil reached Texas. , about of coastline in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida were contaminated by oil and a total of had been oiled since the spill began. , of coastline remain subject to evaluation and/or cleanup operations. Concerns were raised about the appearance of underwater, horizontally extended plumes of dissolved oil. Researchers concluded that deep plumes of dissolved oil and gas would likely remain confined to the northern Gulf of Mexico and that the peak impact on dissolved oxygen would be delayed and long lasting. Two weeks after the wellhead was capped on July 15, 2010, the surface oil appeared to have dissipated, while an unknown amount of subsurface oil remained. Estimates of the residual ranged from a 2010 NOAA report that claimed about half of the oil remained below the surface to independent estimates of up to 75%. That means that over (2.4 million barrels) remained in the Gulf. , tar balls, oil sheen trails, fouled wetlands marsh grass and coastal sands were still evident. Subsurface oil remained offshore and in fine silts. In April 2012, oil was still found along as much as of Louisiana coastline and tar balls continued to wash up on the barrier islands. In 2013, some scientists at the Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill and Ecosystem Science Conference said that as much as one-third of the oil may have mixed with deep ocean sediments, where it risks damage to ecosystems and commercial fisheries. In 2013, more than of \\"oiled material\\" was removed from the Louisiana coast. Although only \\"minute\\" quantities of oil continued to wash up in 2013, patches of tar balls were still being reported almost every day from Alabama and Florida Panhandle beaches. Regular cleanup patrols were no longer considered justified but cleanup was being conducted on an as-needed basis, in response to public reports. It was first thought that oil had not reached as far as Tampa Bay, Florida; however, a study done in 2013 found that one of the plumes of dispersant-treated oil had reached a shelf off the Tampa Bay region. According to researchers, there is \\"some evidence it may have caused lesions in fish caught in that area\\".  Efforts to stem the flow of oil  = Short- term efforts = Concept diagram of underwater oil containment domes originally planned for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. At this stage, there were 2 remaining oil leaks from the fallen pipeline. Oil containment dome under construction in Port Fourchon, Louisiana, at Wild Well Control on 26 April First, BP unsuccessfully attempted to close the blowout preventer valves on the wellhead with remotely operated underwater vehicles. Next, it placed a 125-tonne (280,000 lb) containment dome over the largest leak and piped the oil to a storage vessel. While this technique had worked in shallower water, it failed here when gas combined with cold water to form methane hydrate crystals that blocked the opening at the top of the dome. Pumping heavy drilling fluids into the blowout preventer to restrict the flow of oil before sealing it permanently with cement (\\"top kill\\") also failed. BP then inserted a riser insertion tube into the pipe and a stopper-like washer around the tube plugged at the end of the riser and diverted the flow into the insertion tube. The collected gas was flared and oil stored on board the drillship Discoverer Enterprise. Before the tube was removed, it collected of oil. On June 3, 2010, BP removed the damaged drilling riser from the top of the blowout preventer and covered the pipe by the cap which connected it to another riser. On June 16, a second containment system connected directly to the blowout preventer began carrying oil and gas to service vessels, where it was consumed in a clean-burning system. The United States government's estimates suggested the cap and other equipment were capturing less than half of the leaking oil. On July 10, the containment cap was removed to replace it with a better-fitting cap (\\"Top Hat Number 10\\"). Mud and cement were later pumped in through the top of the well to reduce the pressure inside it which didn't work either. A final device was created to attach a chamber of larger diameter than the flowing pipe with a flange that bolted to the top of the blowout preventer and a manual valve set to close off the flow once attached. On July 15, the device was secured and time was taken closing the valves to ensure the attachment under increasing pressure until the valves were closed completing the temporary measures. = Well declared \\"effectively dead\\" = Transocean's Development Driller III started drilling a first relief well on May 2, 2010. GSF Development Driller II started drilling a second relief on May 16, 2010. On August 3, 2010, first test oil and then drilling mud was pumped at a slow rate of approximately per minute into the well-head. Pumping continued for eight hours, at the end of which the well was declared to be \\"in a static condition.\\" On August 4, 2010, BP began pumping cement from the top, sealing that part of the flow channel permanently. On September 3, 2010, the 300-ton failed blowout preventer was removed from the well and a replacement blowout preventer was installed. On September 16, 2010, the relief well reached its destination and pumping of cement to seal the well began. On September 19, 2010, National Incident Commander Thad Allen declared the well \\"effectively dead\\" and said that it posed no further threat to the Gulf. =Recurrent or continued leakage= The Discoverer Enterprise and the Q4000 work around the clock burning undesirable gases from the still uncapped Deepwater Horizon well in the Gulf of Mexico. 26 June 2010 In May 2010, BP admitted they had \\"discovered things that were broken in the sub-surface\\" during the \\"top kill\\" effort. Oil slicks were reported in March and August 2011, in March and October 2012,Aeppli_2013 and in January 2013. Repeated scientific analyses confirmed that the sheen was a chemical match for oil from the Macondo well. The USCG initially said the oil was too dispersed to recover and posed no threat to the coastline, but later warned BP and Transocean that they might be held financially responsible for cleaning up the new oil. USGS director Marcia McNutt stated that the riser pipe could hold at most because it is open on both ends, making it unlikely to hold the amount of oil being observed. In October 2012, BP reported that they had found and plugged leaking oil from the failed containment dome, now abandoned about from the main well. In December 2012, the USCG conducted a subsea survey; no oil coming from the wells or the wreckage was found and its source remains unknown. In addition, a white, milky substance was observed seeping from the wreckage. According to BP and the USCG, it is \\"not oil and it's not harmful.\\" In January 2013, BP said that they were continuing to investigate possible sources of the oil sheen. Chemical data implied that the substance might be residual oil leaking from the wreckage. If that proves to be the case, the sheen can be expected to eventually disappear. Another possibility is that it is formation oil escaping from the subsurface, using the Macondo well casing as flow conduit, possibly intersecting a naturally occurring fault, and then following that to escape at the surface some distance from the wellhead. If it proves to be oil from the subsurface, then that could indicate the possibility of an indefinite release of oil. The oil slick was comparable in size to naturally occurring oil seeps and was not large enough to pose an immediate threat to wildlife.  Containment, collection and use of dispersants  The fundamental strategies for addressing the spill were containment, dispersal and removal. In summer 2010, approximately 47,000 people and 7,000 vessels were involved in the project. By 3 October 2012, federal response costs amounted to $850 million, mostly reimbursed by BP. , 935 personnel were still involved. By that time cleanup had cost BP over $14 billion. It was estimated with plus-or-minus 10% uncertainty that of oil was released from the well; of oil went into the Gulf. The report led by the Department of the Interior and the NOAA said that \\"75% [of oil] has been cleaned up by Man or Mother Nature\\"; however, only about 25% of released oil was collected or removed while about 75% of oil remained in the environment in one form or another. In 2012, Markus Huettel, a benthic ecologist at Florida State University, maintained that while much of BP's oil was degraded or evaporated, at least 60% remains unaccounted for. In May 2010, a local native set up a network for people to volunteer their assistance in cleaning up beaches. Boat captains were given the opportunity to offer the use of their boat to help clean and prevent the oil from further spreading. To assist with the efforts the captains had to register their ships with the Vessels of Opportunity, however an issue arose when more boats registered than actually participated in the clean up efforts - only a third of the registered boats. Many local supporters were disappointed with BP's slow response, prompting the formation of The Florida Key Environmental Coalition. This coalition gained significant influence in the clean up of the oil spill to try and gain some control over the situation. = Containment = Oil containment boom used in an attempt to protect barrier islands Containment booms stretching over were deployed, either to corral the oil or as barriers to protect marshes, mangroves, shrimp/crab/oyster ranches or other ecologically sensitive areas. Booms extend above and below the water surface and were effective only in relatively calm and slow-moving waters. Including one-time use sorbent booms, a total of of booms were deployed. Booms were criticized for washing up on the shore with the oil, allowing oil to escape above or below the boom, and for ineffectiveness in more than three to four-foot (90‚Äì120 cm) waves. The Louisiana barrier island plan was developed to construct barrier islands to protect the coast of Louisiana. The plan was criticised for its expense and poor results. Critics allege that the decision to pursue the project was political with little scientific input. The EPA expressed concern that the booms would threaten wildlife. For a time, a group called Matter of Trust, citing insufficient availability of manufactured oil absorption booms, campaigned to encourage hair salons, dog groomers and sheep farmers to donate hair, fur and wool clippings, stuffed in pantyhose or tights, to help contain oil near impacted shores, a technique dating back to the Exxon Valdez disaster. = Use of Corexit dispersant = A C-130 Hercules sprays alt=A large four propeller airplane sprays Corexit onto oil-sheen water The spill was also notable for the volume of Corexit oil dispersant used and for application methods that were \\"purely experimental.\\" Altogether, of dispersants were used; of this were released at the wellhead. Subsea injection had never previously been tried but due to the spill's unprecedented nature BP together with USCG and EPA decided to use it. Over 400 sorties were flown to release the product. Although usage of dispersants was described as \\"the most effective and fast moving tool for minimizing shoreline impact\\", the approach continues to be investigated. A 2011 analysis conducted by Earthjustice and Toxipedia showed that the dispersant could contain cancer-causing agents, hazardous toxins and endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Environmental scientists expressed concerns that the dispersants add to the toxicity of a spill, increasing the threat to sea turtles and bluefin tuna. The dangers are even greater when poured into the source of a spill, because they are picked up by the current and wash through the Gulf. According to BP and federal officials, dispersant use stopped after the cap was in place; however, marine toxicologist Riki Ott wrote in an open letter to the EPA that Corexit use continued after that date and a GAP investigation stated that \\"[a] majority of GAP witnesses cited indications that Corexit was used after [July 2010].\\" According to a NALCO manual obtained by GAP, Corexit 9527 is an ‚Äúeye and skin irritant. Repeated or excessive exposure ... may cause injury to red blood cells (hemolysis), kidney or the liver.‚Äù The manual adds: ‚ÄúExcessive exposure may cause central nervous system effects, nausea, vomiting, anesthetic or narcotic effects.‚Äù It advises, ‚ÄúDo not get in eyes, on skin, on clothing,‚Äù and ‚ÄúWear suitable protective clothing.‚Äù For Corexit 9500 the manual advised, ‚ÄúDo not get in eyes, on skin, on clothing,‚Äù ‚ÄúAvoid breathing vapor,‚Äù and ‚ÄúWear suitable protective clothing.‚Äù According to FOIA requests obtained by GAP, neither the protective gear nor the manual were distributed to Gulf oil spill cleanup workers. Corexit EC9500A and Corexit EC9527A were the principal variants. The two formulations are neither the least toxic, nor the most effective, among EPA's approved dispersants, but BP said it chose to use Corexit because it was available the week of the rig explosion. On 19 May, the EPA gave BP 24 hours to choose less toxic alternatives to Corexit from the National Contingency Plan Product Schedule, and begin applying them within 72 hours of EPA approval or provide a detailed reasoning why no approved products met the standards. On 20 May, BP determined that none of the alternative products met all three criteria of availability, non-toxicity and effectiveness. On 24 May, EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson ordered EPA to conduct its own evaluation of alternatives and ordered BP to reduce dispersant use by 75%. BP reduced Corexit use by per day, a 9% decline. On 2 August 2010, the EPA said dispersants did no more harm to the environment than the oil and that they stopped a large amount of oil from reaching the coast by breaking it down faster. However, some independent scientists and EPA's own experts continue to voice concerns about the approach. Underwater injection of Corexit into the leak may have created the oil plumes which were discovered below the surface. Because the dispersants were applied at depth, much of the oil never rose to the surface. One plume was long, more than wide and deep. In a major study on the plume, experts were most concerned about the slow pace at which the oil was breaking down in the cold, water at depths of . In late 2012, a study from Georgia Tech and Universidad Autonoma de Aguascalientes in Environmental Pollution journal reported that Corexit used during the BP oil spill had increased the toxicity of the oil by 52 times. The scientists concluded that \\"Mixing oil with dispersant increased toxicity to ecosystems\\" and made the gulf oil spill worse.\\" = Removal = Oil skimming vessels (distance) in the Gulf of Mexico Dark clouds of smoke and fire emerge as oil burns during a controlled fire in the Gulf of Mexico, 6 May 2010 The three basic approaches for removing the oil from the water were: combustion, offshore filtration, and collection for later processing. USCG said of tainted water was recovered, including of oil. BP said had been recovered or flared. It is calculated that about 5% of leaked oil was burned at the surface and 3% was skimmed. On the most demanding day 47,849 people were assigned on the response works. From April to mid-July 2010, 411 controlled in-situ fires remediated approximately . The fires released small amounts of toxins, including cancer-causing dioxins. According to EPA's report, the released amount is not enough to pose an added cancer risk to workers and coastal residents, while a second research team concluded that there was only a small added risk. Workers cleaning a beach affected by the spill. Oil was collected from water by using skimmers. In total 2,063 various skimmers were used. For offshore, more than 60 open-water skimmers were deployed, including 12 purpose-built vehicles. EPA regulations prohibited skimmers that left more than 15 parts per million (ppm) of oil in the water. Many large-scale skimmers exceeded the limit. Due to use of Corexit the oil was too dispersed to collect, according to a spokesperson for shipowner TMT. In mid-June 2010, BP ordered 32 machines that separate oil and water, with each machine capable of extracting up to . After one week of testing, BP began to proceed and by 28 June, had removed . After the well was capped, the cleanup of shore became the main task of the response works. Two main types of affected coast were sandy beaches and marshes. On beaches the main techniques were sifting sand, removing tar balls, and digging out tar mats manually or by using mechanical devices. For marshes, techniques such as vacuum and pumping, low-pressure flush, vegetation cutting, and bioremediation were used. = Oil-eating microbes = Dispersants are said to facilitate the digestion of the oil by microbes. Mixing dispersants with oil at the wellhead would keep some oil below the surface and in theory, allowing microbes to digest the oil before it reached the surface. Various risks were identified and evaluated, in particular that an increase in microbial activity might reduce subsea oxygen levels, threatening fish and other animals. Several studies suggest that microbes successfully consumed part of the oil. By mid-September, other research claimed that microbes mainly digested natural gas rather than oil. David L. Valentine, a professor of microbial geochemistry at UC Santa Barbara, said that the capability of microbes to break down the leaked oil had been greatly exaggerated. However, biogeochemist Chris Reddy, said natural microorganisms are a big reason why the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico was not far worse. Genetically modified Alcanivorax borkumensis was added to the waters to speed digestion. The delivery method of microbes to oil patches was proposed by the Russian Research and Development Institute of Ecology and the Sustainable Use of Natural Resources.  Access restrictions  On May 18, 2010, BP was designated the lead \\"Responsible Party\\" under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which meant that BP had operational authority in coordinating the response.Marisa Taylor and Renee Schoof for McClatchy Newspapers, 18 May 2010. BP withholds oil spill facts ‚Äî and government lets it Gerald Baron for Crisisblogger, 8 June 2012. White House and BP legal wrangling: more damage to collaborative work in disaster response The first video images were released on 12 May, and further video images were released by members of Congress who had been given access to them by BP.Jeremy W Peters for The New York Times, 9 June 2010 Efforts to Limit the Flow of Spill News During the spill response operations, at the request of the Coast Guard, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) implemented a temporary flight restriction zone over the operations area. Restrictions were to prevent civilian air traffic from interfering with aircraft assisting the response effort. All flights in the operations' area were prohibited except flight authorized by air traffic control; routine flights supporting offshore oil operations; federal, state, local and military flight operations supporting spill response; and air ambulance and law enforcement operations. Exceptions for these restrictions were granted on a case-by-case basis dependent on safety issues, operational requirements, weather conditions, and traffic volume. No flights, except aircraft conducting aerial chemical dispersing operations, or for landing and takeoff, were allowed below . Notwithstanding restrictions, there were 800 to 1,000 flights per day during the operations. Local and federal authorities citing BP's authority denied access to members of the press attempting to document the spill from the air, from boats, and on the ground, blocking access to areas that were open to the public.CBS News May 18, 2010 BroadcastMac McClelland for Mother Jones, 24 May 2010. \\"It's BP's Oil': Running the Corporate Blockade at Louisiana's Crude-Covered BeachesMatthew Philips, \\"BP's Photo Blockade of the Gulf Oil Spill: Photographers Say BP and Government Officials Are Preventing Them from Documenting the Impact of the Deepwater Horizon Disaster\\", Newsweek, 25 May 2010.Matthew Lysiak and Helen Kennedy, \\"Dying, dead marine wildlife paint dark, morbid picture of Gulf Coast following oil spill\\", Daily News (New York), 2 June 2010.Dan Zak for the Washington Post, 3 June 2010. As oil spread, did BP battle to contain the media?NPR. 4 June 2010 Transcript: Media Encounter Access Problems While Covering The Oil Spill In some cases photographers were granted access only with BP officials escorting them on BP-contracted boats and aircraft. In one example, the U.S. Coast Guard stopped Jean-Michel Cousteau's boat and allowed it to proceed only after the Coast Guard was assured that no journalists were on board. In another example, a CBS News crew was denied access to the oil- covered beaches of the spill area. The CBS crew was told by the authorities: \\"this is BP's rules, not ours,\\" when trying to film the area.PR Newser, 20 May 2010, Crisis Communications, CBS Denied Access to Shoot Oil Spill Some members of Congress criticized the restrictions placed on access by journalists. The FAA denied that BP employees or contractors made decisions on flights and access, saying those decisions were made by the FAA and Coast Guard. The FAA acknowledged that media access was limited to hired planes or helicopters, but was arranged through the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard and BP denied having a policy of restricting journalists; they noted that members of the media had been embedded with the authorities and allowed to cover response efforts since the beginning of the effort, with more than 400 embeds aboard boats and aircraft to date. They also said that they wanted to provide access to the information while maintaining safety. Cleanup On 15 April 2014, BP announced that cleanup along the coast was substantially complete, while the United States Coast Guard work continued using physical barriers such as floating booms, the cleanup workers' objective was to keep the oil from spreading any further. They used skimmer boats to remove a majority of the oil and they used sorbents to absorb any remnant of oil like a sponge. Although that method did not remove the oil completely, chemicals called dispersants are used to hasten the oil's degradation to prevent the oil from doing further damage to the marine habitats below the surface water. For the Deep Horizon oil spill, cleanup workers used of various chemical dispersants to further breakdown the oil. The State of Louisiana was funded by BP to do regular testing of fish, shellfish, water, and sand. Initial testing regularly showed detectable levels of dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate, a chemical used in the clean up. Testing over the past year (2019) reported by GulfSource.org, for the pollutants tested have not produced results.GulfSource.org  Consequences  = Environmental impact = Capturing heavily oiled young turtles 20 to 40 miles offshore for rehabilitation; 14 June 2010 The spill area hosts 8,332 species, including more than 1,270 fish, 604 polychaetes, 218 birds, 1,456 mollusks, 1,503 crustaceans, 4 sea turtles and 29 marine mammals. Between May and June 2010, the spill waters contained 40 times more polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) than before the spill. PAHs are often linked to oil spills and include carcinogens and chemicals that pose various health risks to humans and marine life. The PAHs were most concentrated near the Louisiana Coast, but levels also jumped 2‚Äì3 fold in areas off Alabama, Mississippi and Florida. PAHs can harm marine species directly and microbes used to consume the oil can reduce marine oxygen levels. The oil contained approximately 40% methane by weight, compared to about 5% found in typical oil deposits. Methane can potentially suffocate marine life and create \\"dead zones\\" where oxygen is depleted. A 2014 study of the effects of the oil spill on bluefin tuna funded by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Stanford University, and the Monterey Bay Aquarium and published in the journal Science, found that the toxins from oil spills can cause irregular heartbeats leading to cardiac arrest. Calling the vicinity of the spill \\"one of the most productive ocean ecosystems in the world\\", the study found that even at very low concentrations \\"PAH cardiotoxicity was potentially a common form of injury among a broad range of species in the vicinity of the oil.\\" Another peer-reviewed study, released in March 2014 and conducted by 17 scientists from the United States and Australia and published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that tuna and amberjack that were exposed to oil from the spill developed deformities of the heart and other organs that would be expected to be fatal or at least life-shortening. The scientists said that their findings would most likely apply to other large predator fish and \\"even to humans, whose developing hearts are in many ways similar.\\" BP responded that the concentrations of oil in the study were a level rarely seen in the Gulf, but The New York Times reported that the BP statement was contradicted by the study. An oiled brown pelican near Grand Isle, Louisiana The oil dispersant Corexit, previously only used as a surface application, was released underwater in unprecedented amounts, with the intent of making it more easily biodegraded by naturally occurring microbes. Thus, oil that would normally rise to the surface of the water was emulsified into tiny droplets and remained suspended in the water and on the sea floor. The oil and dispersant mixture permeated the food chain through zooplankton. Signs of an oil-and-dispersant mix were found under the shells of tiny blue crab larvae. A study of insect populations in the coastal marshes affected by the spill also found a significant impact. Chemicals from the spill were found in migratory birds as far away as Minnesota. Pelican eggs contained \\"petroleum compounds and Corexit\\". Dispersant and PAHs from oil are believed to have caused \\"disturbing numbers\\" of mutated fish that scientists and commercial fishers saw in 2012, including 50% of shrimp found lacking eyes and eye sockets. Fish with oozing sores and lesions were first noted by fishermen in November 2010. Prior to the spill, approximately 0.1% of Gulf fish had lesions or sores. A report from the University of Florida said that many locations showed 20% of fish with lesions, while later estimates reached 50%. In October 2013, Al Jazeera reported that the gulf ecosystem was \\"in crisis\\", citing a decline in seafood catches, as well as deformities and lesions found in fish. According to J. Christopher Haney, Harold Geiger, and Jeffrey Short, three researchers with extensive experience in environmental monitoring and post- spill mortality assessments, over one million coastal birds died as a direct result of the Deepwater Horizon spill. These numbers, coupled with the National Audubon Society scientists' observations of bird colonies and bird mortality well after the acute phase, have led scientists to conclude that more than one million birds ultimately succumbed to the lethal effects of the Gulf oil spill. In July 2010, it was reported that the spill was \\"already having a 'devastating' effect on marine life in the Gulf\\". Damage to the ocean floor especially endangered the Louisiana pancake batfish whose range is entirely contained within the spill-affected area. In March 2012, a definitive link was found between the death of a Gulf coral community and the spill. According to NOAA, a cetacean Unusual Mortality Event (UME) has been recognized since before the spill began, NOAA is investigating possible contributing factors to the ongoing UME from the Deepwater Horizon spill, with the possibility of eventual criminal charges being filed if the spill is shown to be connected. Some estimates are that only 2% of the carcasses of killed mammals have been recovered. Striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) observed in emulsified oil on 29 April 2010 In the first birthing season for dolphins after the spill, dead baby dolphins washed up along Mississippi and Alabama shorelines at about 10 times the normal number. A peer-reviewed NOAA/BP study disclosed that nearly half the bottlenose dolphins tested in mid-2011 in Barataria Bay, a heavily oiled area, were in ‚Äúguarded or worse‚Äù condition, \\"including 17 percent that were not expected to survive\\". BP officials deny that the disease conditions are related to the spill, saying that dolphin deaths actually began being reported before the BP oil spill. By 2013, over 650 dolphins had been found stranded in the oil spill area, a four-fold increase over the historical average. The National Wildlife Federation (NWF) reports that sea turtles, mostly endangered Kemp‚Äôs ridley sea turtles, have been stranding at a high rate. Before the spill there were an average of 100 strandings per year; since the spill the number has jumped to roughly 500. NWF senior scientist Doug Inkley notes that the marine death rates are unprecedented and occurring high in the food chain, strongly suggesting there is \\"something amiss with the Gulf ecosystem\\". In December 2013, the journal Environmental Science & Technology published a study finding that of 32 dolphins briefly captured from 24-km stretch near southeastern Louisiana, half were seriously ill or dying. BP said the report was ‚Äúinconclusive as to any causation associated with the spill‚Äù. Heavy oiling of Bay Jimmy, Plaquemines Parish; 15 September 2010 In 2012, tar balls continued to wash up along the Gulf coast and in 2013, tar balls could still be found in on the Mississippi and Louisiana coasts, along with oil sheens in marshes and signs of severe erosion of coastal islands, brought about by the death of trees and marsh grass from exposure to the oil. In 2013, former NASA physicist Bonny Schumaker noted a \\"dearth of marine life\\" in a radius around the well, after flying over the area numerous times since May 2010.Gulf of Mexico, since the BP Oil Spill of 2010 April In 2013, researchers found that oil on the bottom of the seafloor did not seem to be degrading, and observed a phenomenon called a \\"dirty blizzard\\": oil in the water column began clumping around suspended sediments, and falling to the ocean floor in an \\"underwater rain of oily particles.\\" The result could have long-term effects because oil could remain in the food chain for generations. A 2014 bluefin tuna study in Science found that oil already broken down by wave action and chemical dispersants was more toxic than fresh oil. A 2015 study of the relative toxicity of oil and dispersants to coral also found that the dispersants were more toxic than the oil. A 2015 study by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, published in PLOS ONE, links the sharp increase in dolphin deaths to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.Ryan Grenoble (20 May 2015). Spike In Dolphin Deaths Directly Tied To Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill, Researchers Say. The Huffington Post. Retrieved 20 May 2015.Nicholas St. Fleur (20 May 2015). Study Links Dolphin Deaths to Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill. The New York Times. Retrieved 21 May 2015. On 12 April 2016, a research team reported that 88 percent of about 360 baby or stillborn dolphins within the spill area \\"had abnormal or under-developed lungs\\", compared to 15 percent in other areas. The study was published in the April 2016 Diseases of Aquatic Organisms. = Health consequences = By June 2010, 143 spill-exposure cases had been reported to the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals; 108 of those involved workers in the clean-up efforts, while 35 were reported by residents. Chemicals from the oil and dispersant are believed to be the cause; it is believed that the addition of dispersants made the oil more toxic. A worker cleans up oily waste on Elmer's Island just west of Grand Isle, La., 21 May 2010 The United States Department of Health and Human Services set up the GuLF Study in June 2010 in response to these reports. The study is run by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and will last at least five years. Workers contracted by BP clean up oil on a beach in Port Fourchon, Louisiana, 23 May 2010 Mike Robicheux, a Louisiana physician, described the situation as \\"the biggest public health crisis from a chemical poisoning in the history of this country.\\" In July, after testing the blood of BP cleanup workers and residents in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida for volatile organic compounds, environmental scientist Wilma Subra said she was \\"finding amounts 5 to 10 times in excess of the 95th percentile\\"; she said that \\"the presence of these chemicals in the blood indicates exposure.\\" Riki Ott, a marine toxicologist with experience of the Exxon Valdez oil spill, advised families to evacuate the Gulf.Rose Aguilar, \\"Experts: Health Hazards in Gulf Warrant Evacuations \\", Truthout, 22 July 2010. She said that workers from the Valdez spill had suffered long-term health consequences.\\"Health of Exxon Valdez cleanup workers was never studied\\", Herald-Review (McClatchy), 4 July 2010. Following the 26 May 2010 hospitalization of seven fishermen that were working in the cleanup crew, BP requested that the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health perform a Health Hazard Evaluation. This was to cover all offshore cleanup activities, BP later requested a second NIOSH investigation of onshore cleanup operations. Tests for chemical exposure in the seven fishermen were negative; NIOSH concluded that the hospitalizations were most likely a result of heat, fatigue, and terpenes that were being used to clean the decks. Review of 10 later hospitalizations found that heat exposure and dehydration were consistent findings but could not establish chemical exposure. NIOSH personnel performed air monitoring around cleanup workers at sea, on land, and during the application of Corexit. Air concentrations of volatile organic compounds and PAHs never exceeded permissible exposure levels. A limitation of their methodology was that some VOCs may have already evaporated from the oil before they began their investigation. In their report, they suggest the possibility that respiratory symptoms might have been caused by high levels of ozone or reactive aldehydes in the air, possibly produced from photochemical reactions in the oil. NIOSH did note that many of the personnel involved were not donning personal protective equipment (gloves and impermeable coveralls) as they had been instructed to and emphasized that this was important protection against transdermal absorption of chemicals from the oil. Heat stress was found to be the most pressing safety concern.Health Hazard Evaluation of Deepwater Horizon Response Workers National Institute for Occupation Safety and Health, August 2011. Workers reported that they were not allowed to use respirators, and that their jobs were threatened if they did. OSHA said \\"cleanup workers are receiving \\"minimal\\" exposure to airborne toxins...OSHA will require that BP provide certain protective clothing, but not respirators.\\" ProPublica reported that workers were being photographed while working with no protective clothing. An independent investigation for Newsweek showed that BP did not hand out the legally required safety manual for use with Corexit, and were not provided with safety training or protective gear. A 2012 survey of the health effects of the spill on cleanup workers reported \\"eye, nose and throat irritation; respiratory problems; blood in urine, vomit and rectal bleeding; seizures; nausea and violent vomiting episodes that last for hours; skin irritation, burning and lesions; short-term memory loss and confusion; liver and kidney damage; central nervous system effects and nervous system damage; hypertension; and miscarriages\\". Dr. James Diaz, writing for the American Journal of Disaster Medicine, said these ailments appearing in the Gulf reflected those reported after previous oil spills, like the Exxon Valdez. Diaz warned that \\"chronic adverse health effects, including cancers, liver and kidney disease, mental health disorders, birth defects and developmental disorders should be anticipated among sensitive populations and those most heavily exposed\\". Diaz also believes neurological disorders should be expected. Two years after the spill, a study initiated by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health found biomarkers matching the oil from the spill in the bodies of cleanup workers. Other studies have reported a variety of mental health issues, skin problems, breathing issues, coughing, and headaches. In 2013, during the three-day \\"Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill & Ecosystem Science Conference\\", findings discussed included a '\\"significant percentage\\" of Gulf residents reporting mental health problems like anxiety, depression and PTSD. These studies also showed that the bodies of former spill cleanup workers carry biomarkers of \\"many chemicals contained in the oil\\".Conferences on this theme occurred at least in 2016 and 2017. A study that investigated the health effects among children in Louisiana and Florida living less than 10 miles from the coast found that more than a third of the parents reported physical or mental health symptoms among their children. The parents reported \\"unexplained symptoms among their children, including bleeding ears, nose bleeds, and the early start of menstruation among girls,\\" according to David Abramson, director of Columbia University's National Center for Disaster Preparedness. A cohort study of almost 2,200 Louisiana women found \\"high physical/environmental exposure was significantly associated with all 13 of the physical health symptoms surveyed, with the strongest associations for burning in nose, throat or lungs; sore throat; dizziness and wheezing. Women who suffered a high degree of economic disruption as a result of spill were significantly more likely to report wheezing; headaches; watery, burning, itchy eyes and stuffy, itchy, runny nose.Lauren C.

Estimates of lost tourism dollars were projected to cost the Gulf coastal economy up to 22.7 billion through 2013. In addition, Louisiana reported that lost visitor spending through the end of 2010 totaled $32 million, and losses through 2013 were expected to total $153 million in this state alone. The Gulf of Mexico commercial fishing industry was estimated to have lost $247 million as a result of postspill fisheries closures. One study projects that the overall impact of lost or degraded commercial, recreational, and mariculture fisheries in the Gulf could be $8.7 billion by 2020, with a potential loss of 22,000 jobs over the same time frame. BP's expenditures on the spill included the cost of the spill response, containment, relief well drilling, grants to the Gulf states, claims paid, and federal costs, including fines and penalties. Due to the loss of the market value, BP had dropped from the second to the fourth largest of the four major oil companies by 2013. During the crisis, BP gas stations in the United States reported a sales drop of between 10 and 40% due to backlash against the company. Local officials in Louisiana expressed concern that the offshore drilling moratorium imposed in response to the spill would further harm the economies of coastal communities as the oil industry directly or indirectly employs about 318,000 Louisiana residents (17% of all jobs in the state). NOAA had closed , or approximately 36% of Federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico, for commercial fishing causing $2.5 billion cost for the fishing industry. The U.S. Travel Association estimated that the economic impact of the oil spill on tourism across the Gulf Coast over a three-year period could exceed approximately $23 billion, in a region that supports over 400,000 travel industry jobs generating $34 billion in revenue annually. = Offshore drilling policies = US oil production and imports, 1910‚Äì2012. On 30 April 2010, President Barack Obama ordered the federal government to hold the issuing of new offshore drilling leases and authorized the investigation of 29 oil rigs in the Gulf in an effort to determine the cause of the disaster. Later a six-month offshore drilling (below of water) moratorium was enforced by the United States Department of the Interior. The moratorium suspended work on 33 rigs, and a group of affected companies formed the Back to Work Coalition. On 22 June, a United States federal judge on the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana Martin Leach-Cross Feldman when ruling in the case Hornbeck Offshore Services LLC v. Salazar, lifted the moratorium finding it too broad, arbitrary and not adequately justified. The ban was lifted in October 2010. On 28 April 2010, the National Energy Board of Canada, which regulates offshore drilling in the Canadian Arctic and along the British Columbia Coast, issued a letter to oil companies asking them to explain their argument against safety rules which require same-season relief wells. On 3 May California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger withdrew his support for a proposed plan to allow expanded offshore drilling projects in California. On 8 July, Florida Governor Charlie Crist called for a special session of the state legislature to draft an amendment to the state constitution banning offshore drilling in state waters, which the legislature rejected on 20 July. In October 2011, the United States Department of the Interior's Minerals Management Service was dissolved after it was determined it had exercised poor oversight over the drilling industry. Three new agencies replaced it, separating the regulation, leasing, and revenue collection responsibilities respectively, among the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, and Office of Natural Resources Revenue. In March 2014, BP was again allowed to bid for oil and gas leases.  Reactions  = U.S. reactions = Protesters advocating boycott of BP On 30 April, President Obama dispatched the Secretaries of the Department of Interior and Homeland Security, as well as the EPA Administrator and NOAA to the Gulf Coast to assess the disaster. In his 15 June speech, Obama said, \\"This oil spill is the worst environmental disaster America has ever faced... Make no mistake: we will fight this spill with everything we've got for as long as it takes. We will make BP pay for the damage their company has caused. And we will do whatever's necessary to help the Gulf Coast and its people recover from this tragedy.\\" Interior Secretary Ken Salazar stated, \\"Our job basically is to keep the boot on the neck of British Petroleum.\\" Some observers suggested that the Obama administration was being overly aggressive in its criticisms, which some BP investors saw as an attempt to deflect criticism of his own handling of the crisis. Rand Paul accused President Obama of being anti-business and \\"un-American\\". Public opinion polls in the U.S. were generally critical of the way President Obama and the federal government handled the disaster and they were extremely critical of BPs response. Across the US, thousands participated in dozens of protests at BP gas stations and other locations, reducing sales at some stations by 10% to 40%. Industry claimed that disasters are infrequent and that this spill was an isolated incident and rejected claims of a loss of industry credibility. The American Petroleum Institute (API) stated that the offshore drilling industry is important to job creation and economic growth. CEOs from the top five oil companies all agreed to work harder at improving safety. API announced the creation of an offshore safety institute, separate from API's lobbying operation. American protester stands on a Union Jack, presumably associating BP with the United Kingdom The Organization for International Investment, a Washington D.C.-based advocate for overseas investment in the United States, warned that the heated rhetoric was potentially damaging the reputation of British companies with operations in the United States and could spark a wave of U.S. protectionism that would restrict British firms from government contracts, political donations and lobbying. In July 2010, President Obama issued an executive order, specifically citing the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, that adopted recommendations from the Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force and established the National Ocean Council. The council called together a number of federal committees and departments engaged in ocean issues to work with a newly established committee for conservation and resource management. In June 2018, the executive order establishing the National Ocean Council was revoked by President Trump in an effort to roll back bureaucracy and benefit \\"ocean industries [that] employ millions of Americans\\". = United Kingdom reactions = In the UK, there was anger at the American press and news outlets for the misuse of the term \\"British Petroleum\\" for the company ‚Äì a name which has not been used since British Petroleum merged with the American company Amoco in 1998 to form BP. It was said that the U.S. was \\"dumping\\" the blame onto the British people and there were calls for British Prime Minister David Cameron to protect British interests in the United States. British pension fund managers (who have large holdings of BP shares and rely upon its dividends) accepted that while BP had to pay compensation for the spill and the environmental damage, they argued that the cost to the company's market value from President Obama's criticism was far outweighing the direct clean-up costs. Initially, BP downplayed the incident; its CEO Tony Hayward called the amount of oil and dispersant \\"relatively tiny\\" in comparison with the \\"very big ocean.\\" Later, he drew an outpouring of criticism when he said that the spill was a disruption to Gulf Coast residents and himself adding, \\"You know, I'd like my life back.\\" BP's chief operating officer Doug Suttles contradicted the underwater plume discussion noting, \\"It may be down to how you define what a plume is here‚Ä¶ The oil that has been found is in very minute quantities.\\" In June, BP launched a PR campaign and successfully bid for several search terms related to the spill on Google and other search engines so that the first sponsored search result linked directly to the company's website. On 26 July 2010, it was announced that CEO Tony Hayward was to resign and would be replaced by Bob Dudley, who is an American citizen and previously worked for Amoco. Hayward's involvement in Deepwater Horizon has left him a highly controversial public figure. In May 2013, he was honored as a \\"distinguished leader\\" by the University of Birmingham, but his award ceremony was stopped on multiple occasions by jeers and walk-outs and the focus of a protest from People & Planet members. In July 2013, Hayward was awarded an honorary degree from Robert Gordon University. This was described as \\"a very serious error of judgement\\" by Friends of the Earth Scotland, and \\"a sick joke\\" by the university's student president. = International reactions = The U.S. government rejected offers of cleanup help from Canada, Croatia, France, Germany, Ireland, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Romania, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United Nations. The U.S. State Department listed 70 assistance offers from 23 countries, all being initially declined, but later, 8 had been accepted. The USCG actively requested skimming boats and equipment from several countries.  Legal aspects and settlements  = Investigations = In the United States the Deepwater Horizon investigation included several investigations and commissions, including reports by the USCG National Incident Commander, Admiral Thad Allen, the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE), National Academy of Engineering, National Research Council, Government Accountability Office, National Oil Spill Commission, and Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board. The Republic of the Marshall Islands Maritime Administrator conducted a separate investigation on the marine casualty. BP conducted its internal investigation. An investigation of the possible causes of the explosion was launched on 22 April 2010 by the USCG and the Minerals Management Service. On 11 May the United States administration requested the National Academy of Engineering conduct an independent technical investigation. The National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling was established on 22 May to \\"consider the root causes of the disaster and offer options on safety and environmental precautions.\\" The investigation by United States Attorney General Eric Holder was announced on 1 June 2010. Also the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce conducted a number of hearings, including hearings of Tony Hayward and heads of Anadarko and Mitsui's exploration unit. According to the US Congressional investigation, the rig's blowout preventer, built by Cameron International Corporation, had a hydraulic leak and a failed battery, and therefore failed. On 8 September 2010, BP released a 193-page report on its web site. The report places some of the blame for the accident on BP but also on Halliburton and Transocean. The report found that on 20 April 2010, managers misread pressure data and gave their approval for rig workers to replace drilling fluid in the well with seawater, which was not heavy enough to prevent gas that had been leaking into the well from firing up the pipe to the rig, causing the explosion. The conclusion was that BP was partly to blame, as was Transocean, which owned the rig. Responding to the report, Transocean and Halliburton placed all blame on BP.Mark Clayton for the Christian Science Monitor. 8 September 2010 Transocean, Halliburton blast BP report on cause of blowout, oil spill On 9 November 2010, a report by the Oil Spill Commission said that there had been \\"a rush to completion\\" on the well and criticised poor management decisions. \\"There was not a culture of safety on that rig,\\" the co- chair said. The National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling released a final report on 5 January 2011. The panel found that BP, Halliburton, and Transocean had attempted to work more cheaply and thus helped to trigger the explosion and ensuing leakage. The report stated that \\"whether purposeful or not, many of the decisions that BP, Halliburton, and Transocean made that increased the risk of the Macondo blowout clearly saved those companies significant time (and money).\\" BP released a statement in response to this, saying, that \\"even prior to the conclusion of the commission's investigation, BP instituted significant changes designed to further strengthen safety and risk management.\\" Transocean, however, blamed BP for making the decisions before the actual explosion occurred and government officials for permitting those decisions. Halliburton stated that it was acting only upon the orders of BP when it injected the cement into the wall of the well. It criticized BP for its failure to run a cement bond log test. In the report, BP was accused of nine faults. One was that it had not used a diagnostic tool to test the strength of the cement. Another was ignoring a pressure test that had failed. Still another was for not plugging the pipe with cement. The study did not, however, place the blame on any one of these events. Rather, it concluded that \\"notwithstanding these inherent risks, the accident of April 20 was avoidable\\" and that \\"it resulted from clear mistakes made in the first instance by BP, Halliburton and Transocean, and by government officials who, relying too much on industry's assertions of the safety of their operations, failed to create and apply a program of regulatory oversight that would have properly minimized the risk of deepwater drilling.\\" The panel also noted that the government regulators did not have sufficient knowledge or authority to notice these cost-cutting decisions. On 23 March 2011, BOEMRE (former MMS) and the USCG published a forensic examination report on the blowout preventer, prepared by Det Norske Veritas. The report concluded that the primary cause of failure was that the blind shear rams failed to fully close and seal due to a portion of drill pipe buckling between the shearing blocks. The US government report issued in September 2011 stated that BP is ultimately responsible for the spill, and that Halliburton and Transocean share some of the blame. The report states that the main cause was the defective cement job, and Halliburton, BP and Transocean were, in different ways, responsible for the accident. The report stated that, although the events leading to the sinking of Deepwater Horizon were set into motion by the failure to prevent a well blowout, the investigation revealed numerous systems deficiencies, and acts and omissions by Transocean and its Deepwater Horizon crew, that had an adverse impact on the ability to prevent or limit the magnitude of the disaster. The report also states that a central cause of the blowout was failure of a cement barrier allowing hydrocarbons to flow up the wellbore, through the riser and onto the rig, resulting in the blowout. The loss of life and the subsequent pollution of the Gulf of Mexico were the result of poor risk management, last‚Äêminute changes to plans, failure to observe and respond to critical indicators, inadequate well control response, and insufficient emergency bridge response training by companies and individuals responsible for drilling at the Macondo well and for the operation of the drilling platform. = Spill response fund = President Barack Obama meets with EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson to discuss response to the spill. On 16 June 2010, after BP executives met with President Obama, BP announced and established the Gulf Coast Claims Facility (GCCF), a $20 billion fund to settle claims arising from the Deepwater Horizon spill. This fund was set aside for natural resource damages, state and local response costs, and individual compensation, but could not be used for fines or penalties. Prior to establishing the GCCF, emergency compensation was paid by BP from an initial facility. The GCCF was administrated by attorney Kenneth Feinberg. The facility began accepting claims on 23 August 2010. On 8 March 2012, after BP and a team of plaintiffs' attorneys agreed to a class-action settlement, a court-supervised administrator Patrick Juneau took over administration. Until this more than one million claims of 220,000 individual and business claimants were processed and more than $6.2 billion was paid out from the fund. 97% of payments were made to claimants in the Gulf States. In June 2012, the settlement of claims through the GCCF was replaced by the court supervised settlement program. During this transition period additional $404 million in claims were paid. The GCCF and its administrator Feinberg had been criticized about the amount and speed of payments as well as a lack of transparency. An independent audit of the GCCF, announced by Attorney General Eric Holder, was approved by Senate on 21 October 2011. An auditor BDO Consulting found that 7,300 claimants were wrongly denied or underpaid. As a result, about $64 million of additional payments was made. The Mississippi Center for Justice provided pro bono assistance to 10,000 people to help them \\"navigate the complex claims process.\\" In a New York Times opinion piece, Stephen Teague, staff attorney at the Mississippi Center for Justice, argued that BP had become \\"increasingly brazen\\" in \\"stonewalling payments.\\" \\"But tens of thousands of gulf residents still haven't been fully compensated for their losses, and many are struggling to make ends meet. Many low-wage workers in the fishing and service industries, for example, have been seeking compensation for lost wages and jobs for three years.\\" In July 2013, BP made a motion in court to freeze payments on tens of thousands of claims, arguing inter alia that a staff attorney from the Deepwater Horizon Court-Supervised Settlement Program, the program responsible for evaluating compensation claims, had improperly profited from claims filed by a New Orleans law firm. The attorney is said to have received portions of settlement claims for clients he referred to the firm. The federal judge assigned to the case, Judge Barbier, refused to halt the settlement program, saying he had not seen evidence of widespread fraud, adding that he was \\"offended by what he saw as attempts to smear the lawyer administering the claims.\\" = Civil litigation and settlements = By 26 May 2010, over 130 lawsuits relating to the spill had been filed against one or more of BP, Transocean, Cameron International Corporation, and Halliburton Energy Services, although it was considered likely by observers that these would be combined into one court as a multidistrict litigation. On 21 April 2011, BP issued $40 billion worth of lawsuits against rig owner Transocean, cementer Halliburton and blowout preventer manufacturer Cameron. The oil firm alleged failed safety systems and irresponsible behaviour of contractors had led to the explosion, including claims that Halliburton failed to properly use modelling software to analyze safe drilling conditions. The firms deny the allegations. On 2 March 2012, BP and plaintiffs agreed to settle their lawsuits. The deal would settle roughly 100,000 claims filled by individuals and businesses affected by the spill. On 13 August, BP asked US District Judge Carl Barbier to approve the settlement, saying its actions \\"did not constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct\\". On 13 January 2013, Judge Barbier approved a medical-benefits portion of BP's proposed $7.8 billion partial settlement. People living for at least 60 days along oil-impacted shores or involved in the clean-up who can document one or more specific health conditions caused by the oil or dispersants are eligible for benefits, as are those injured during clean-up. BP also agreed to spend $105 million over five years to set up a Gulf Coast health outreach program and pay for medical examinations. According to a group presenting the plaintiffs, the deal has no specific cap. BP says that it has $9.5 billion in assets set aside in a trust to pay the claims, and the settlement will not increase the $37.2 billion the company budgeted for spill- related expenses. BP originally expected to spend $7.8 billion. By October 2013 it had increased its projection to $9.2 billion, saying it could be \\"significantly higher.\\" On 31 August 2012, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) filed papers in federal court in New Orleans blaming BP for the Gulf oil spill, describing the spill as an example of \\"gross negligence and willful misconduct.\\" In their statement the DOJ said that some of BP's arguments were \\"plainly misleading\\" and that the court should ignore BP's argument that the Gulf region is \\"undergoing a robust recovery\\". BP rejected the charges saying \\"BP believes it was not grossly negligent and looks forward to presenting evidence on this issue at trial in January.\\" The DOJ also said Transocean, the owner and operator of the Deepwater Horizon rig, was guilty of gross negligence as well. On 14 November 2012, BP and the US Department of Justice reached a settlement. BP will pay $4.5 billion in fines and other payments, the largest of its kind in US history. In addition, the U.S. government temporarily banned BP from new federal contracts over its \\"lack of business integrity\\". The plea was accepted by Judge Sarah Vance of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana on 31 January 2013. The settlement includes payments of $2.394 billion to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, $1.15 billion to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, $350 million to the National Academy of Sciences for oil spill prevention and response research, $100 million to the North America Wetland Conservation Fund, $6 million to General Treasury and $525 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Oil sector analysts at London-based investment bank Canaccord Genuity noted that a settlement along the lines disclosed would only be a partial resolution of the many claims against BP. On 3 January 2013, the US Justice Department announced \\"Transocean Deepwater Inc. has agreed to plead guilty to violating the Clean Water Act and to pay a total of $1.4 billion in civil and criminal fines and penalties\\". $800 million goes to Gulf Coast restoration Trust Fund, $300 million to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, $150 million to the National Wild Turkey Federation and $150 million to the National Academy of Sciences. MOEX Offshore 2007 agreed to pay $45 million to the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, $25 million to five Gulf state and $20 million to supplemental environmental projects. On 25 July 2013, Halliburton pleaded guilty to destruction of critical evidence after the oil spill and said it would pay the maximum allowable fine of $200,000 and will be subject to three years of probation. In January 2014, a panel of the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected an effort by BP to curb payment of what it described as \\"fictitious\\" and \\"absurd\\" claims to a settlement fund for businesses and persons affected by the oil spill. BP said administration of the 2012 settlement was marred by the fact that people without actual damages could file a claim. The court ruled that BP hadn't explained \\"how this court or the district court should identify or even discern the existence of 'claimants that have suffered no cognizable injury.'\\" The Court then went further, calling BP's position \\"nonsensical.\\" The Supreme Court of the United States later refused to hear BP's appeal after victims and claimants, along with numerous Gulf coast area chambers of commerce, objected to the oil major's efforts to renege on the Settlement Agreement. In September 2014, Halliburton agreed to settle a large percentage of legal claims against it by paying $1.1 billion into a trust by way of three installments over two years. =Justice Department lawsuit= BP and its partners in the oil well, Transocean and Halliburton, went on trial on February 25, 2013 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana in New Orleans to determine payouts and fines under the Clean Water Act and the Natural Resources Damage Assessment. The plaintiffs included the U.S. Justice Department, Gulf states and private individuals. Tens of billions of dollars in liability and fines were at stake. A finding of gross negligence would result in a four-fold increase in the fines BP would have to pay for violating the federal Clean Water Act, and leave the company liable for punitive damages for private claims. The trial's first phase was to determine the liability of BP, Transocean, Halliburton, and other companies, and if they acted with gross negligence and willful misconduct. The second phase scheduled in September 2013 focused on the flow rate of the oil and the third phase scheduled in 2014 was to consider damages. According to the plaintiffs' lawyers the major cause of an explosion was the mishandling of a rig safety test, while inadequate training of the staff, poor maintenance of the equipment and substandard cement were also mentioned as things leading to the disaster. According to The Wall Street Journal the U.S. government and Gulf Coast states had prepared an offer to BP for a $16 billion settlement. However, it was not clear if this deal had been officially proposed to BP and if BP has accepted it. On 4 September 2014, U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier ruled BP was guilty of gross negligence and willful misconduct. He described BP's actions as \\"reckless.\\" He said Transocean's and Halliburton's actions were \\"negligent.\\" He apportioned 67% of the blame for the spill to BP, 30% to Transocean, and 3% to Halliburton. Fines would be apportioned commensurate with the degree of negligence of the parties, measured against the number of barrels of oil spilled. Under the Clean Water Act fines can be based on a cost per barrel of up to $4,300, at the discretion of the judge. The number of barrels was in dispute at the conclusion of the trial with BP arguing 2.5 million barrels were spilled over the 87 days the spill lasted, while the court contends 4.2 million barrels were spilled. BP issued a statement strongly disagreeing with the finding, and saying the court's decision would be appealed. Barbier ruled that BP had acted with ‚Äúconscious disregard of known risks\\" and rejected BP's assertion that other parties were equally responsible for the oil spill. His ruling stated that BP \\"employees took risks that led to the largest environmental disaster in U.S. history\\", that the company was \\"reckless\\", and determined that several crucial BP decisions were \\"primarily driven by a desire to save time and money, rather than ensuring that the well was secure.\\" BP strongly disagreed with the ruling and filed an immediate appeal. On 2 July 2015, BP, the U.S. Justice Department and five gulf states announced that the company agreed to pay a record settlement of $18.7 billion. To date BP's cost for the clean-up, environmental and economic damages and penalties has reached $54 billion. = Criminal charges = In addition to the private lawsuits and civil governmental actions, the federal government charged multiple companies and five individuals with federal crimes. In the November 2012 resolution of the federal charges against it, BP agreed to plead guilty to 11 felony counts related to the deaths of the 11 workers and paid a $4 billion fine. Transocean's plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge as part of its $1.4 billion fine. In April 2012, the Justice Department filed the first criminal charge against Kurt Mix, a BP engineer, for obstructing justice by deleting messages showing that BP knew the flow rate was three times higher than initial claims by the company, and knew that \\"Top Kill\\" was unlikely to succeed, but claimed otherwise. Three more BP employees were charged in November 2012. Site managers Donald Vidrine and Robert Kaluza were charged with manslaughter for acting negligently in their supervision of key safety tests performed on the rig prior to the explosion, and failure to alert onshore engineers of problems in the drilling operation. David Rainey, BP's former vice-president for exploration in the Gulf of Mexico, was charged with obstructing Congress by misrepresenting the rate that oil was flowing out of the well. Lastly, Anthony Badalamenti, a Halliburton manager, was charged with instructing two employees to delete data related to Halliburton's cementing job on the oil well. None of the charges against individuals resulted in any prison time, and no charges were levied against upper level executives. Anthony Badalementi was sentenced to one year probation, Donald Vidrine paid a $50,000 fine and received 10 months probation, Kurt Mix received 6 months' probation, and David Rainey and Robert Kaluza were acquitted.

With its construction dating to 1713, it is believed to be Noank's oldest surviving structure, built by one of its early settlers. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 22, 1978. Description and history The Edward Yeomans House is located in a rural setting west of the village center of Noank, southwest of a ninety-degree bend in Brook Street on more than overlooking Palmer Cove. It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gambrel roof and central chimney. The exterior is finished in a combination of wooden clapboards and shingles, reflective of its evolutionary growth. The interior follows a typical central chimney plan, with parlors on either side of the chimney, and the kitchen behind, with small chambers in the rear corners. The area that is now Noank was first laid out in 1712, when Groton town officials did so to facilitate further growth in the town. The following year, Edward Yeomans built a five-bay center-chimney structure with gable roof, on land whose ownership was contested by the local Pequot people. Yeomans left the land a few years later, due in part to what he perceived as encroachment by the Pequots on his land. Before 1760, a sixth bay was added, and the roof replaced by the gambrel roof. In the early 19th century, a shed- roof kitchen addition was added, and the main entrance relocated from the south to the north side of the house. The house is believed to be the oldest in Noank.

In February 1355 the shrine was expanded to enshrine the kami as well. Tenjin is the deification of Sugawara no Michizane (845‚Äì903), a famous scholar, poet and politician from the Heian period. As a kami he is associated to scholarship and learning. Currently both kami are enshrined in Yushima Tenman-g≈´. The shrine was later rebuilt in October 1455 at the behest of local warlord Ota Dokan (1432‚Äì1486), and enjoyed greater popularity during the Edo period when it was visited by such Confucian scholars as Hayashi Doshun (1583‚Äì1657) and Arai Hakuseki (1657‚Äì1725). The current structures of Yushima Tenman-g≈´ were rebuilt in 1995. They were made using only cypress, and following closely the tradition of Shinto architecture.

He was a pupil of Jacob Ferdinand Voet. He began his career as an history painter, but he soon abandoned history for portraiture, in which branch of art he became very successful. In 1675 he was admitted into the Academy, and also became painter in ordinary to the king and his court. Upon the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, Agar, as a Protestant, was shut out from the Academy. He accordingly left France in 1682, never to return. He was invited to the court of Denmark, and was greatly patronized by King Christian V. His self-portrait is in the Galleria degli Uffizi in Florence, having been painted for Cosimo III de' Medici in 1693, at the request of King Christian. Walpole tells us that he visited England, where he resided some time, and met with success. He painted the portraits of several members of the British nobility of Queen Anne's reign, including the Duchess of Montagu, the Countesses of Rochfort and Sunderland, Thomas Earl of Strafford, and others. A portrait of Charles II of England, by him, is said to have been formerly in the Gallery at Christiansburg. He died in 1716 in Copenhagen. His son Charles d'Agar also became a portrait painter.

Dokhalah Festival The Dokhalah is a pottery pot with some seedling planted in (such as barley), children take care of at the beginning of Pilgrimage Month. When Eid Al Adha day comes, children throw them toward the sea while chanting \\"Dokhlti Haji be..etc\\" it is well known in Sanabes in the eastern region of Saudi Arabia. Recently, an annual festival is held in Sanabes known as the \\"Dokhalah Festival\\" which also highlights the regional culture and heritage. The Dokhalah is known in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf as well. To describe it, Dokhalah is the name of handmade flowerpot. It made of palm tree vanes and take a cylindrical shape. It is in small size and very handy to 3‚Äì5 years old child. It is filled with sand and implants with barley seeds. It kept to germinating and growing till barley get 5 to 10 centimeter in height, then it became ready as Dokhalah. Nowadays, it is introduced in very nice look and implants with flowers in addition to barley. Each children him/her self is taking care of their Dokhalah and irrigate it on daily basis till grow and takes its final good shape as flowerpot. This practice initiates a good relation and connection between the children and their Dokhalah, so it became beloved to them. = How did Dokhalah origin? = Dokhalah is an activity origin in Persian Gulf area since very long time ago. It became as the area‚Äôs custom and revive every year in tradition ceremony at Hajj Eid-Holiday. Dokhalah ceremonies started since more than 200 years ago by gathering the children in each neighborhood near the coast and start a special song for Dokhalah and at end they throw it to the sea water. In the past, the pilgrims were travelling for long time in order to perform Hajj as no transportation means, and the parent forced to leave their children with their relatives for about 2‚Äì3 months. The Dokhalah began as pastime for the children to mitigate the impact of parent long travel to Hajj. In Eid Al-Adha the pilgrims are doing one of the Hajj rituals which are called sacrifice by slaughter the goat (Qurban). The children were waiting their parents in very warm situation as this day is the sign of Hajj day toward the end and start back journey. So they are sharing their parents by doing another sacrifice which is throwing his very nice Dokhalah to sea water. Question may raise, why throwing it to the sea?, because it add value to the sea environment as fish eat the grass of Dokhalah. The Dokhalah ceremony has nothing to do with the believes or any ritual religion, it is an expression about happiness of Eid Al-Adha‚Äôs advent and it is one of the most greatest holiday in Islam. Dokhalah event started during first day for Eid Al-Adha where Muslims performed their hajj at Makkah, so that, in the Dokhalah song each child solicit in. Children are praying to Allah to give them opportunity to perform hajj when they became young and meet again with their parents, so that's the meaning of Dokhalah song. This is one way that their fathers taught them how to remember hajj and make objective to perform it as a major issue. This practice was discontinued gradually due to life grown up and diminishing the down town life style. Also, the second generation has lost the interest to continue what they were gained from their old generation. In addition to that, the new generation did not attended celebration and nobody taught them about Dokhalah. This tradition is also practiced in Kuwait and Bahrain. In Bahrain it is known as Hiyya Biyya. Research suggests that it very ancient, and may well predate the coming of Islam: see the reference by Holes below. = The first Dokhalah Festival = In 2004, very few people from the middle and old generations were interested and eager to reactivate not only Dokhalah events but other heritage in the area that related to their grandfathers‚Äô life which includes skills, building style, and old traditional games (entertainments). They started the idea of reactivate Dokhalah ceremony and they succeeded in announcing and gathering children at the coast and done exactly what was practiced in the past. This event really ringed the bill to majority of people about Dokhalah. This start helped people to start talking to their children about Dokhalah history and the wheel started again. In 2005, the idea was more crystallized and the event took different shape than in 2004. The year 2006 is synchronized with the establishment of Sanabes Central Social Committee which is an official committee followed to Qatif headquarters committee. All reports to Ministry of Society Affairs. Working under the Sanabes committee umbrellas gave chance to work comfortably through authorized work structure and facilitate the all license difficulties. Working through past three years revealed that people like their heritage and demonstrated massive interest to participate in of Dokhalah Festival. Questionnaire, made the year of 2006 reveal that 100% of attendance agreed to continue this ceremony. This is great success and excellent start and more challenge for coming year, especially, when people know that Sanabes village now is the only which is doing such traditional event and focus is more this year to make another success. In 2007, people expected that most of near-by neighborhoods will participate in attending the Dokhalah Festival. = Dokhalah Festival Goals = The ultimate goals were achieved by having teamwork spirit and activate people skills and ability toward charity and social work. Other objectives from establishing such festival is to mitigate risk and road hazard of our citizen from travelling to very far distance during Eid holidays in order to get the entertainment for their families. Their place suffered from losing very young people (teenagers) during Eid Holidays where they subjected to vital road accidents. This festival if succeeded it will help in providing very near-by place where families not forced to cover long distance and rushing traffics and of course saving a lot of time.

He developed and designed more than 20 racing venues, including Fair Hill at his 5,000-acre estate in Maryland. A member of the Delaware Du Pont family, he was the son of William du Pont and Annie Rogers Zinn, and brother to Marion duPont Scott, a noted horsewoman and breeder. Early life and education William (also called Willie) was born at Loseley Park, a 16th-century manor in Surrey, England. He was the second child and only son of Annie Zinn (n√©e Rogers) and William du Pont Sr. His older sister was Marion, and they grew up at Montpelier, the historic home of President James Madison, which their parents had bought and expanded. They both were educated in private schools and became interested in the world of thoroughbred horseracing, including steeplechase, hunts, and horse shows. William specialized in thoroughbred racing and breeding. Marion also became known for her contributions to horseracing and breeding. Marriages, family, and career On January 1, 1919, du Pont married Jean Liseter Austin. Their marriage celebration in Rosemont, Pennsylvania, was billed as the \\"Wedding of the Century\\" in media accounts because of the wealth of each family. Jean's father, William Liseter Austin, was a railroad baron at the Baldwin Locomotive Works. He gave the couple more than of land as a wedding gift. William's father built Liseter Hall for them on the property in 1922. The three-story Georgian mansion was a replica of Montpelier, where du Pont had grown up.\\"Last hurrah for historic Liseter Hall Farm\\", Mid-Atlantic Thoroughbred, September 2005 du Pont with his wife Jean Liseter, 1919 Du Pont was elected to the board of directors of the Delaware Trust Company, where his father was president (and later chairman of the board), in 1921. His career with the bank would continue until his death. In 1928, William inherited the Bellevue Hall estate in Delaware upon the death of his father. The estate featured a Gothic Revival castle built in 1855, which du Pont had remodeled into another replica of his boyhood home of Montpelier. His father's death also created a vacancy in the presidency of the Delaware Trust Company, and William ascended to the position. Du Pont and his wife developed a notable horse farm on their property. In the 1920s and 1930s, Liseter Hall Farm was considered the ne plus ultra of Mid-Atlantic horse facilities. In addition to the indoor galloping track, the first in the United States, the farm featured a large barn for race horses; a -wide by -long indoor riding ring, used by trainers for schooling young horses; the half-mile training track and its adjacent combination viewing stand/water tower; a breeding shed; a hunter barn; a show horse barn; a loading barn with ramps, for transporting horses to competition; and a grassy, half-mile chute that connected the training track with the race horse, hunter and show horse barns. Similar facilities were built at the Bellevue Hall estate, including a hunting barn, two indoor training tracks, and an outdoor track. Du Pont and Jean had four children together, two girls and two boys. They divorced in February 1941, when the youngest, John, was 2 years old.\\"Divorce to William du Pont, Jr.\\", New York Times, February 26, 1941 Jean Liseter du Pont retained the property her father gave her. Following the divorce, du Pont moved his permanent residence to Bellevue Hall. Du Pont remarried in 1947 to Margaret Osborne, a tennis champion. He built both an indoor and outdoor tennis court at Bellevue for the benefit of his wife. They had a son, William du Pont III, born July 22, 1952. That same year, du Pont was made chairman of the board at the Delaware Trust Company, retaining his position as president as well. Osborne and du Pont divorced in 1964. Their son William du Pont III also was active with thoroughbreds and later owned Pillar Stud in Lexington, Kentucky. Foxcatcher Farm At Liseter Hall Farm, du Pont Jr. established a large thoroughbred racing stable in the 1920s; he raced its horses under the nom de course, Foxcatcher Farm. During this period, he also established breeding operations at Bellevue Hall, his family's estate in Wilmington, Delaware. He had another operation at Fair Hill, where he established a steeplechase course on his facility. In 1927, du Pont imported Satrap from England and brought the son of The Tetrarch to stand at his second facility, the new Walnut Hall Farm near Boyce, Virginia.The Wilmington, Delaware Sunday Morning Star - November 3, 1935 In 1936, duPont was part of the syndicate that bought and imported the stallion Blenheim, Aga Khan's Epsom Derby winner. Du Pont's racing operation was managed for several years by the trainer Preston Burch, selected for the U.S. Racing Hall of Fame. In the mid-1930s, Richard Handlen took over as the trainer, managing the stable operation into the 1960s. During this time, du Pont won the 1938 Preakness Stakes with Dauber, the second race of the Triple Crown for three-year- olds.\\"DAUBER WINS PREAKNESS; CRAVAT SECOND\\", Chicago Tribune, 15 May 1938 Other of his horses won six American championships and prominent races: * Fair Star - 1926 American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly * White Clover II - 1932 Suburban Handicap * Rosemont (horse) took the 1935 Withers Stakes, beating that season's Triple Crown winner, Omaha; he also beat Seabiscuit in the 1937 Santa Anita Handicap, a match race *Ruler, duPont's first homebred stakes winner, won the Brook Steeplechase in 1929 and 1930. * Fairy Chant - 1940 American Champion Three-Year-Old Filly and 1941 American Champion Older Female Horse * Parlo - 1954 American Champion Three-Year-Old Filly and the 1954 and 1955 American Champion Older Female Horse. * Berlo - 1960 American Champion Three-Year-Old Filly. Their successes contributed to the value and reputation of his stables. Du Pont's interests in racing extended to the development and design of racecourses. In all, he created 23 racecourses, including Fair Hill, a steeplechase course at Fair Hill in Cecil County, Maryland, and Delaware Park Racetrack for flat racing. The latter opened on June 26, 1937. He had also helped write the legislation to authorize development of the park and was the major shareholder.History of Delaware Park\\", Official Website The Thoroughbred farms and racing were important parts of the Delaware and Maryland economies in those decades, although racing gradually drew smaller crowds. He died at the Wilmington Medical Center at age 69 on December 31, 1965. Montpelier In 1928, Marion duPont Scott, the older child, inherited Montpelier after their father's death. Located four miles (6 km) south of Orange, Virginia, the estate had been the plantation home of James Madison, fourth President of the United States. In 1934, William and Marion established the Montpelier Races, a National Steeplechase event, which continues to be run each fall on the grounds at Montpelier. At her death in 1983, Scott bequeathed the estate, designated a National Historic Landmark, to the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Her father's will had said that if she were childless, the property would be inherited by her brother and his children. Her will included a provision for his children to sell or give their interests in the property to the National Trust or forfeit their share of a separate $3.1 million trust. In addition, she provided $10 million to the National Trust to buy the property and to establish an endowment. As her brother had died in 1965, his five children inherited Montpelier. Three sold or gave their interests to the National Trust. Although two nephews sued the National Trust in an effort to break the will, they finally sold their interests in 1984.Marjorie Hunter (NY Times News Service), \\"James Madison's Montpelier to become museum:, Gainesville Sun, 18 November 1984 The National Trust acquired the property to preserve and interpret as a public history site for James and Dolley Madison, his presidency, and the architecture and society of Montpelier. There has been increasing emphasis on such interpretation including a full accounting of the lives of the slaves at Montpelier during the Madisons' tenure. Legacy and honors Following du Pont's death, none of his heirs were interested in retaining the Bellevue Hall estate due to its extensive collection of recreational facilities and the upkeep they required.

This would later result in Shouichi, along with Ry≈ç and Makoto Hikawa, further complicating matters and interfering in the work of his emissaries. Casualties mounted on both sides, with the death of the El of the Water convincing the Overlord that the vessels of Agito ‚Äì Shouichi Tsugami, Ry≈ç Ashihara, and Kaoru Kino ‚Äì had grown too powerful. He recommitted to seeing all active Agito vessels hunted down and stripped of their Seeds of Agito, and killing the Riders to suppress the Seeds already absorbed. However, with Hikawa's aid, Shouichi dealt a decisive blow to the Overlord that released the Seeds of Agito back to their rightful owners and forced the Overlord to retreat. The shock that even normal humans had grown strong enough to oppose his power convinced the Overlord that humanity was no longer worthy of existence, and so began orchestrating their extermination. The Overlord enacted his genocide of humanity, realigning the constellations of the Zodiac, to kill all of mankind in bizarre doppelg√§nger homicides starting with those born under Scorpio. The required concentration rendered the Overlord vulnerable, so he created the El of the Wind as his bodyguard and the El of the Ground to continue killing those reaching paranormal maturity. The Riders fought back, destroyed the El Lords, and wounded the retreating Overlord. The Overlord then had a conversation with Tetsuya Sawaki which convinced him that he did not truly understand the mankind he created. The Overlord implies that he will postpone his plans, and observe how humans use their own gifts and whether or not they are worthy of existence. The Overlord is portrayed by .

All Lords are human-like with the head of the animal whose tribe they belong to, and wing-shaped protuberances extending from their shoulders. The Lords target survivors of the Akatsuki incident and humans who possess psychic power, as these people have the potential to become Agito. The Lords' motivation is to protect humanity, believing they do not require the power of Agito which would only corrupt them. When they murder an awakened or potential Agito, they perform a ritual with their hands, saying that they want permission to sin; at the same time, a halo would appear over their heads. Every tribe had a unique way of killing, for example: leaving the corpse in a tree, dissolving the human, drying the human to death, changing the human into sand, pulling the human into the ground, dragging the human into the air and dropping them, vaporizing, etc. Killing a normal human is considered a taboo with a penalty of death, though there are exceptions if the human in question committed murder. When a Lord is killed, the halo typically materializes over their heads before they explode. El Lords Under the Overlord exist three very powerful Lords, known as the .

He eventually awakened, using Masumi to kill for him until he found the Overlord and gained the power to leave his host, killing her in the process. Using Orcinus to stall Agito, the El arrived to personally kill Shouichi. However Ry≈ç intervened and got Shouichi out of harm's way. The El of the Water later encountered G3-X, yet spared him after sensing Hikawa had no potential of becoming an Agito. The El Lord was eventually defeated by Agito Burning Form, returning to the Overlord's body to recuperate and undergo an evolution. The Overlord then sent the El of the Water after the Agitos; in his new , the El of the Water possessed the and heightened psychic power. He managed to overpower the Riders, taking out Agito while fighting the others and winning. But once Shouichi awakened with his memories restored, he battles the El in Burning Form.

It enters the Ill river at Montagne Verte in Strasbourg, just downstream of the confluence of the Bruche and Ill, and some upstream of the centre of the city. When the canal was built, the Ill provided navigable connections to the city and the Rhine, and in later years to the Canal du Rhone au Rhine and the Canal de la Marne au Rhin.

It is located in the city's centre, at Agias Sofias street opposite Makedonomachon square. Backside view History and description Roman era floor Interior The Acheiropoietos has been dated from its bricks and mosaics to ca. 450‚Äì470, making it perhaps the earliest of the city's surviving churches. It was modified in the 7th and again in the 14th‚Äì15th centuries. Known as the Panagia Theotokos in Byzantine times, it is dedicated to Mary. Its current name is first attested in 1320, presumably after a miraculous acheiropoietos (\\"not made by hands\\") icon of Panagia Hodegetria that was housed there. Byzantine sources also indicate that the cult of the city's patron saint, Saint Demetrius, was also practised there. Mosaic Interior The building is a three-aisled basilica, some 28 m wide and 36.5 m long, with a wooden roof. Its eastern end is a semicircular vault, while on the western side a narthex, flanked by towers, and traces of an exonarthex survive. The three aisles are separated by columns, while the two side aisles have galleries above them. At the eastern end of the northern side aisle, a middle Byzantine chapel dedicated to St. Irene is attached. On the northwestern corner of the basilica, the stairway leading to the galleries survives. The current entrance is through a triple-arched opening (tribelon) that connects the narthex with the main nave, while on the southern side there is a monumental entranceway, which probably connected the church with the city's Byzantine-era thoroughfare. Another small adjoining building on the south side has been identified as the church's baptistery. The modern roof is lower than the original, where the section above the central nave was elevated to allow light in. The surviving parts of the church's rich original interior decoration include particularly fine 5th-century Ionian capitals from a Constantinopolitan workshop, the green Thessalian marble columns of the tribelon, the original Proconnesian marble pavement of the central nave, and fragments of 5th-century decorative mosaics. Fine but damaged early 13th- century frescoes depicting the Forty Martyrs of Sebaste adorn the southern side. Underneath the north aisle's current pavement, three layers of floor mosaics from an earlier Roman-era bath have been uncovered. After Ottoman conquest of the city in 1430, the Acheiropoietos was the first church to be converted into a mosque, by Sultan Murad II himself. Throughout the Ottoman period, it remained the city's principal mosque under the name Eski Camii (\\"Old Mosque\\"). An inscription by Murad survives in the northern colonnade, on the eighth column from the east.

It began on the morning of 20 May 1941, when Nazi Germany launched an airborne invasion of Crete under the codename Unternehmen Merkur (\\"Operation Mercury\\"). Allied forces, consisting mainly of Greek reservists and gendarmerie, along with Australian regular infantry, defended the airfield. While the Allies succeeded in controlling the airfield, inflicting heavy casualties on the Germans, and taking many prisoners (including the commander of the German assault on Retimo, Oberst (Colonel) Alfred Sturm), the victory was quickly nullified by the defeat of Allied forces on Crete as a whole. Background Rethymnon, a town on the north coast of Crete, was important to the military defense of Crete by the British and Commonwealth force because an airport had been completed about east of the town and near Pigi village shortly before the battle. British and other Commonwealth forces had been forced out of mainland Greece by the Germans and had retreated to Crete. While there were between 27,000‚Äì28,000 troops in Crete to defend it, most were only lightly armed because the heavier equipment had been left in Greece.Bassett, James A. \\"Past Airborne Employment\\", Military Affairs, Vol. 12, No. 4 (Winter, 1948), p 214 URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/1983420 Although the Germans were able to dominate the skies, the British Royal Navy had control of the sea. The German plan was to use paratroopers and gliders to send forces down by air. Prelude The Australian 2/1st and 2/11th Battalions, supported by elements from Australian artillery, medical, engineer and signals units, as well as the Greek 4th and 5th Regiments, took up positions in the hills south of the airfield. This was in anticipation of an airborne German attack. Australian Lieutenant Colonel Ian Campbell, commanding the 2/1st Battalion, was overall commander of the Rethymnon units and had been charged to defend the area.Battle of Retimo The defence was based around two hills that overlooked the airstrip.Bell, ATJ, \\"The Battle for Crete - The Tragic Truth\\", Australian Defence Force Journal 1991 no.88, May‚ÄìJune p.15-18 The day before the battle, a lone German plane flow over Rethymnon on a reconnaissance mission. Against orders, a Bren gun position shot it down. Campbell obtained a code book and photos of the area from the crashed aircraft. From the photos, Campbell could see that part of the defences were hidden by trees and would not be known by the Germans. The code was used by the commander of the 2/11th Battalion, Lieutenant Colonel Ray Sandover, to order supplies. The offensive German paratroopers, Fallschirmj√§ger, landed in three areas on 20 May: Maleme, Rethymnon and Iraklion. The German operation was a three-pronged strike. The central assault, codenamed Aris, focused on Rethymnon.Stouros, I Brigadier. \\"Allied forces in Greece and Crete. 1941\\" Australian Defence Force Journal 1991 no.88, May‚ÄìJune pp 31 - 42 The Battle of Maleme, on the west of the island, was over relatively quickly,Bassett, James A. \\"Past Airborne Employment\\", Military Affairs, Vol. 12, No. 4 (Winter, 1948), p 214 URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/1983420 and the Battle of Heraklion continued for some days. The German 2nd Parachute Rifle Regiment, numbering two battalions and with detachments from divisional support troops, were to land and attack Rethymnon. The paratroopers had expected to take the airfield easily, but were surprised when they found it heavily defended. Preceded by heavy aerial bombing, the initial German landing was disorganised, with seven transport Junkers Ju 52s shot down and the paratroopers receiving heavy casualties. However, the paratroopers did manage to capture the hill that 2/1st Battalion was positioned on. German forces were also able to block the roads east and west of Rethymnon. On 22 May, after two failed counterattacks, a third counterattack organised in four columns by the Australians drove the Germans off the hill, who took up positions in an old olive oil factory at Stavromenos. While the German paratroopers had no heavy equipment or armour, the Australian troops had the use of two Matilda tanks as well as artillery. However, the two tanks were not used effectively, as both tank crews were originally captured after the tanks were trapped in ditches. Control of one was later regained, and it was used to support the infantry with a further attack by the Australians, which drove the Germans out of the factory on 26 May, who later retreated to Heraklion.Handel, Paul. Matilda Tanks at Rethymnon on the Island of Crete Part 1 http://www.docstoc.com/docs/28108326/Matilda- Tanks-at-Retimo-on-the-Island-of-Crete-1/ Another group of German paratroopers made a landing to the west of the airfield. However, their landings were scattered, and some landed on top of the 2/11th Battalion with others dropping in the nearby plain. Those that were not intercepted or captured moved towards the town of Rethymnon itself. Finding Rethymnon defended by Cretan police, the Germans took up defensive positions in a ridge that ran from the mountains to the sea. From 22‚Äì28 May, Australian and Greek troops moved together against the German paratroopers in this ridge. Coordination between the Australians and the Greeks proved difficult, and at one point, the lesser-trained Greek soldiers opened fire early and warned the Germans of the incoming Australian attack. There was no communication with other Allied units on Crete, so Campbell was unaware as to what had been happening with the overall Allied effort. An attack was made against Pervolia on 27 May, with the use of the two Matilda tanks (both of which had now been recovered from their immobilised positions). When one tank was knocked out by anti-tank guns and the other was hit by a mine, the attack stalled. The assault on Pervolia again proceeded on 28 May, and this time the town was taken. By this time, the Australians were running low on supplies and were forced to withdraw after holding Pervolia for only a short while.Handel, Paul. Matilda Tanks at Rethymnon on the Island of Crete Part 1 http://www.docstoc.com/docs/28108326/Matilda-Tanks-at-Retimo-on- the-Island-of-Crete-1/ On 29 May, the Greeks abandoned their positions and the Australians were forced to reduce the size of their perimeter. While the battles for Rethymnon and the Battle of Heraklion had been more successful for the allies, the German were quickly successful at the Battle of Maleme where New Zealand troops had mistakenly retreated, giving up control of the airport. The German control of the airstrip there, coupled with their total air superiority, meant that the Luftwaffe could now land infantry and equipment by plane. At this time, reinforcements from Maleme arrived to assist the original Fallschirmj√§ger, including German panzers, and the Australians soon found themselves outgunned and surrounded. Aftermath With the Greek troops gone, a lack of food, dwindling supplies, no contact with the rest of the Allied troops on Crete (who were in fact surrendering or retreating), and the appearance of additional German troops, Campbell chose to order the Rethymnon group to surrender to the Germans. However, Lieutenant Colonel Sandover, in charge of the 2/11th Battalion, instructed his men that they could either surrender or evade capture. Many chose the latter by hiding in the hills, some protected by local Cretans who were under threat of being executed by the Germans.

It was established in 1972 and has, as of 2016, 30,203 Bachelor students and 2576 on a Master's program, 1255 tenured and 1056 temporary teachers. The UMA offers 65 degree courses and 6 double degrees, over 21 doctoral programmes, 64 master's Degrees, and 100 courses throughout the academic year. Education takes place in 18 centres by appointed teachers from 81 departments. The great majority of the teaching is organised within the two campuses, although classes also take place in locations spread around the city centre, as well as in Ronda and Antequera. History The history of the University of M√°laga begins in 1968 with the creation of the Association of Friends of the University of M√°laga (Asociaci√≥n de Amigos de la Universidad de M√°laga). This association sought the creation of the university because of the needs of the city (it was the only European city of over 300,000 inhabitants which did not have a university.) The University of M√°laga was founded by decree of 18 August 1972 by grouping existing centers in the late 1960s: the Higher Polytechnic School (Spanish: Escuela Universitaria Polit√©cnica) (1927), the Normal School (1846), the Faculty of Economics of the University of Granada in M√°laga (1963) and the Seminar (1587). At the time of its creation, the university provided the Faculty of Economics and Business and the Faculty of Medicine, which were created after the ratification of the decree. Its first location was the El Ejido Campus, along with several administrative centers around the city. UMA developed an expansion plan regarding fields of study and infrastructure. Thus, once established in El Ejido Campus, the University expanded towards the western district of Teatinos, an area that initially comprised the School of Medicine, the School of Humanities, and the School of Science, and gradually developed into a whole campus providing a full range of academic studies and services. Casa de Correos y Tel√©grafos, home of UMA's Rectorate. imagen Campus El Ejido Research The UMA has 278 research groups, which are involved in 80 national projects and 30 European and International projects. In the last few years, the number of agreements and contracts with businesses and organisations has varied between 350 and 400 and an average of over 50 patents have been registered‚Äî30 of them of an international nature. In recent years, reduction in public funding for research projects has driven to the loss of many research positions and the rise of very short-term contracts, with salaries for researches as low as 600 euros per month. Campus UMA is divided into two campuses in M√°laga. In turn, some of the University's activities are carried out in other strategic locations throughout the city and province; thus, this network of knowledge is present in key points such as the city's business centre, Andalusia's Technology Park, and in other cities such as Ronda and Antequera. Situated below the Alcazaba and opposite the Park and Port of Malaga is the Recorate's Building. Due to its cultural and architectural values, this building constitutes a cultural, social, and academic reference at the city centre. Moreover, the School of Health Sciences, the Centre of Spanish for Speakers of Other Languages, the Provincial Council's subsidised Nursing School, and the Grice-Hutchinson Experimental Centre are also located in the city. =El Ejido Campus= Located in the centre of Malaga, the campus at El Ejido houses the Faculties of Economic Science, Architecture and Fine Arts. This place contrasts sharply with surrounding areas where poverty and unemployment are common. The Government Building, which accommodates the various offices of deputy vice-chancellorships, is situated on this site, along with most of the administrative departments and the Secretariat of the Board. Another of the emblematic buildings on this campus, is the University Auditorium, which can hold 450 people; it is here that the opening ceremony for each academic year takes place, and where university staff meetings and acts of protocol are held. UMA's Botanical garden, with the School of Arts and Humanities in the background. =Teatinos Campus= At present the most numerous faculties are to be found at the Teatinos campus, and include the departments of Communication Sciences, Education Sciences, Law, Computer Engineering, Telecommunications Engineering, Tourism, Science, Philosophy and Arts, Medicine, Psychology, Industrial Engineering, Technology, Social Work and Business Studies. Facilities for use by the university community include the general library, a publishing service, a research institute building, an infant school, the University Sports Complex, computer rooms, a botanical garden, five lecture halls and a choice of caf√©s, university dining halls and leisure areas. The campus will be reinforced with the addition of a further 1.2 million square metres to the current surface area and will see the construction of facilities for teaching purposes, together with areas for educational, social, sporting, residential, and leisure use. There will also be a business and residential area, besides numerous green zones. Altogether, this will make up one of the largest university campuses in Andalusia. It will serve as a nucleus for the Campus Andaluz de Excelencia (Andalusia Campus of Excellence), and encourage all public universities to undertake common projects in training, research, and the transfer of knowledge. The various building projects for the extension of the university will be carried out in different phases and undertaken with respect for the environment and resources. The soon to be constructed Health Sciences and Psychology Faculty, will be an addition to the recently opened Engineering and the Social and Business Studies Complex. Other more important building projects in collaboration with the Ministerio de la Vivienda y la Consejer√≠a de Vivienda y Ordenaci√≥n del Territorio ( Ministry for Housing and the Department for Housing and Town Planning), will include student halls of residence and rented accommodation, together with a Science and Business Park, destined for use by research groups and companies. The function of the Science and Business Park, is to form a strategic alliance for the creation of an academic, scientific, entrepreneurial and innovative environment, which will operate within the framework of the Estrategia Universidad 2015 (University Strategy 2015). The Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion (Ministry for Science and Innovation), is the driving force behind this project and has as its objective the creation of a Campus de Excelencia Internacional (Campus for International Excellence) for Spanish universities. Also being able to participate within the university environment, will be combined universities, research and development institutes, technological centres and the productive sector. Study options The University of Malaga has undergraduate and postgraduate courses in all disciplines. On offer are a total of 65 undergraduate degrees and 6 double degrees, 64 master's degrees and 21 doctoral programmes all of which can be combined with internal qualifications courses, language courses, summer courses and university programmes for seniors. =Degrees according to area of knowledge= ENGINEERING AND ARCHITECTURE POLYTECHNIC SCHOOL * Electrical Engineering. * Industrial Design and Product Development Engineering. * Industrial Electronics Engineering. * Mechanical Engineering. * Double Degree in Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering. * Double Degree in Electrical Engineering and Industrial Electronics Engineering. * Double Degree in Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Design and Product Development Engineering.

Heroines (Anvil Press) is an epic photographic documentary of 400 addicted women of Vancouver‚Äôs Downtown Eastside, which won the 2003 Vancouver Book Award (in a tie with Stan Douglas), and was the subject of numerous philosophical essays (by Margot Leigh Butler, and Paul Ugor, among them). The London Observer said Clarkes' book offered \\"beauty in a beastly place.\\" Globe and Mail called it \\"intimate, compelling and undeniably unsettling,\\" while The Toronto Star called it \\"incredibly powerful.\\" In the summer of 2017, the Canadian art collector Bob Rennie purchased the entire Heorines photographic collection and archive. Views, a retrospective of his works (Universal/Northern Electric), included a 17 song original soundtrack, featuring songs by Herald Nix, Rae Spoon and others. . Quattro Books published Clarkes' third book of photography, Cyclists, in 2013. A selection of 150 men and women riding bicycles, the book documents the cycling movement in Toronto. In 2001, Peace Arch Entertainment produced a one-hour documentary film about Clarkes' Heroines project called, Heroines: A Photographic Obsession Heroines: A Photographic Obsession, which has aired on BRAVO! and Women's Television Network and has screened at numerous festivals. In 2011 Clarkes was featured in Bob Barrett's television documentary series Snapshots: The Art of Photography Snapshots: The Art of Photography (Network Knowledge Network). The program features Clarkes‚Äô accounts of many of his significant photographic series, including Shot in America, Portraits of Women in Texas with their Guns, and Anti-War Protesters. It was filmed while Clarkes was living on the top floor of Vancouver's historical Sylvia Hotel. In 2016, the actor Tony Pantages portrayed Clarkes in director Rachel Talalay's Leo Award-winning film (for Best TV Film), called On The Farm. Clarkes has had solo exhibitions in Vancouver, Toronto and Seattle. His photographs have been used in the feature films Everything's Gone Green, by Douglas Coupland, directed by Paul Fox, and Atom Egoyan's The Sweet Hereafter. Clarkes' portrait work includes Helmut Newton, Oliver Stone, Vivianne Westwood, Noam Chomsky, Timothy Leary and Patti Smith. Clarkes dropped out of Emily Carr University of Art and Design, where he was studying painting, to take up photography, for which he is self-taught. He nonetheless had a solo exhibition of his paintings at Heffel Gallery in 1983, largely due to his street-art practice. At the time, he founded a fashion boutique and fronted an art-wave band. \\"In the style of Lewis Hine or Dorothy Lange, [Clarkes'] work chronicles a particular segment of society with the intention of educating, affecting change in societal perceptions and, one would hope, influencing social policy,\\" wrote Jesseca White, in sub-Terrain magazine. A reviewer in arts magazine Border Crossings wrote, \\"The world would be a better place if there were more noticers: People who take the time to listen hard and watch closely. Lincoln Clarkes is a noticer.\\" In the London, England, journal Philosophy of Photography, Kelly Wood argues that \\"the Heroines series‚Äô blurs the boundaries between commercial, documentary and fine art photography.\\" References 1\\\\.

He was also the winner of Mister World 2010, having won the competition held in Incheon, South Korea on 27 March 2010. Early life Kamal was born in Limerick, Ireland to a Nigerian father and an Irish-Italian mother; through his mother, Kamal is a cousin of U.S. actor Danny DeVito. He finished primary school at J.F.K Memorial and went on to complete his leaving certificate at the Ardscoil Ris all-boys Catholic secondary school. At 15, he enlisted as a part-time reservist in the Irish Defence Forces and was an active member for 9 years, serving as a 3 star private in the artillery & air defense unit until 2009 At 18 he attended the Limerick Institute of Technology to study Electronic Engineering but he dropped out of the college within a year to self fund his way through flight school; he got his private pilot's license at the age of 19. He returned to college at 21 and earned a professional qualification in Resource Management while working as a recruitment consultant for engineering and pharmaceutical companies, which he continued until he was 23. Career Ibrahim began modeling at the age of 19 to further fund his pilot studies. At 23 he was entered into the Mr. Ireland contest, which he won. The following year in March 2010, he went to South Korea to represent Ireland at \\"Mr. World,\\" the world's largest and most famous, ‚Äòboot camp styled‚Äô male pageant. Of the 74 countries represented, Ibrahim placed first and was crowned 'The worlds most desirable man'. Ibrahim spent the following 2 years traveling the world as the global ambassador for the Mister World Organisation. In January 2011 Kamal began to explore a career in television. He attended The Park Studio in Dublin and Aspire Presenting in London to learn television production and train as a television presenter. In the summer of 2011 he enrolled at the Met Film School in Ealing studios in London and trained as an actor; he also took up hip-hop, salsa and Jazz at Pineapple dance studios, received vocal training at the London Academy of Media, Film & Television, and worked intermittently as an online game show presenter for Gold Rush TV. Kamal moved to Australia in March 2012. He returned to recruitment for a period. He soon found work as an actor, model and presenter through several agencies in Sydney. Kamal's presenting career progressed in 2012 when he was selected to host Mr. World with Myleene Klass. In 2013 he co-hosted a six-part documentary series on RT√â Television in Ireland called In Your Shoes and signed a contract with the National Lottery, which also aired on RT√â. In September 2013 Ibrahim was paired up again with Myleene to host Miss World, which was broadcast live from Bali, Indonesia and aired to an audience of over 1 billion viewers via the official broadcaster RCTI and their international partners. Up to 2012 Ibrahim had focused more on presenting than acting starring in a short film titled, '‚Äô40 Cent Prophecy,‚Äô' while in Australia. He did make his professional acting debut when he was cast by producer Robert C Kelly to play the lead role in the 2013 Christmas pantomime Aladdin, which ran 35 successful shows. Film career Kamal began editing videos in 2010 during his tour as Mr World. He continued making amateur videos until 2014 when be began working professionally as an editor for Bankhouse Productions, a production company set up by his long time friend Matthew Toman. The pair worked together extensively and grew the company to a respectable size. During his time at Bankhouse Kamal worked in all aspects of production as a producer, director, editor and production manager and was managing partner of the business before his departure in 2017. Complementing is broadcasting career, Kamal then created Reelscreen Films, a film and video production company based in Dublin. To date, Kamal's filmography includes, 'SOUTH' (2016), 'Release' (2017) and 'If Only' (2017). Charity work In May 2010, Kamal was appointed the National Ambassador of the Variety Club of Ireland and has since helped to raise over $3,000,000 for the charity worldwide. He continues to work with Variety as well as a number of other charities helping sick, disabled and disadvantaged children and young adults. Mister World Title As well as winning the contest in 2010, Kamal was a major part in the 2013 Mister World competition held in London.

Olaf Ryes plass is the green central square. Olaf Ryes plass (lit. \\"Olaf Rye's Square\\") is a square and park placed centrally in the Gr√ºnerl√∏kka borough of Oslo, Norway. It is more or less square in shape. History The area belonged to the municipality of Aker until 1858, when it was incorporated into Christiania (Oslo). It was an open area which was bought by the municipality from Thorvald Meyer in 1863. In 1864 it received its name; the namesake was the military leader Olaf Rye. It was made into a park in 1890. The park has a bust monument of Eilert Sundt, raised in 1892, and a fountain was added some years later. Other major parks in the area are Birkelunden, Sofienberg Park, and T√∏yen Park. Part of the park The park is surrounded by four streets as well as housing three and four storeys tall, mostly built in the 1870s, 1880s, and 1890s. The three-storey housing was built first. Among the most notable inhabitants of these buildings were the young Edvard Munch from 1882 to 1883. Already in 1875 Johan Cordt Harmens Storjohann took the initiative to raise a gospel hall adjacent to the park; it was converted to a school in 1880, a church between 1917 and 1938, and later a women's hostel until 1985. The building is called Hauges Minde, named after lay preacher Hans Nielsen Hauge. In 1907 the stage theatre Gr√ºnerl√∏kkens Folketheater was opened in a building adjacent to the park, renamed Gr√ºnerl√∏kkens Verdenstheater five years later. The theatre was reconstructed and expanded in the years 1918‚Äì1922; upon the reopening it had its name changed to Parkteatret. In 1932, the building was adorned by the architect Paul Ansteinsson. From 1926 to 1991 that building also featured a movie theatre. Transport Olaf Ryes plass is a tram stop on the Gr√ºnerl√∏kka‚ÄìTorshov Line of the Oslo Tramway. It is served by lines 11, 12, and 13. The park is not served directly by bus.

It has a number of functions, including seeking out the enemy and securing ground in advance of the main force.  History  The vanguard derives from the traditional division of a medieval army into three battles or wards; the Van, the Main (or Middle), and the Rear. The term Vanguard originates with the medieval French avant-garde, i.e. \\"the advance guard\\". The vanguard would lead the line of march and would deploy first on the field of battle, either in front of the other wards or to the right if they stood in line. The makeup of the vanguard of a fifteenth-century Burgundian army is a typical example. This consisted of *a contingent of foreriders, from whom a forward detachment of scouts was drawn *the main body of the vanguard, in which there traveled civil officials and trumpeters to carry messages and summon the surrender of towns and castles, and *a body of workmen under the direction of the Master of Artillery whose job it was to clear obstacles which would obstruct the baggage and artillery travelling with the main army. In an English force of the period, the foreriders of the vanguard would be accompanied by the harbingers, whose job was to locate lodgings for the army for the following night.Rogers (2007), pp 76‚Äì7 =Forward detachments= During the Soviet-German War (1941-1945), beginning in July 1943, the Red Army began forming, as part of its offensive doctrine, ad hoc vanguard formations called forward detachments [peredovye otriady], from army, corps and divisional units. Forward detachments brought together the mobile (motorized or mechanized) elements of the parent formation to play an exploitation role once a breakthrough of the German lines occurred. A rifle division, for example, might mount one or two battalions of infantry on trucks, with motorized antitank guns and motorized artillery in support.David M.

Most seismic attributes are post-stack, but those that use CMP gathers, such as amplitude versus offset (AVO), must be analysed pre-stack.Young, R. & LoPiccolo, R. 2005. AVO analysis demystified. E&P.; http://www.e-seis.com/white_papers/AVO%20Analysis%20Demystified.pdf They can be measured along a single seismic trace or across multiple traces within a defined window. The first attributes developed were related to the 1D complex seismic trace and included: envelope amplitude, instantaneous phase, instantaneous frequency, and apparent polarity. Acoustic impedance obtained from seismic inversion can also be considered an attribute and was among the first developed. Other attributes commonly used include: coherence, azimuth, dip, instantaneous amplitude, response amplitude, response phase, instantaneous bandwidth, AVO, and spectral decomposition. A seismic attribute that can indicate the presence or absence of hydrocarbons is known as a direct hydrocarbon indicator. Amplitude attributes Amplitude attributes use the seismic signal amplitude as the basis for their computation. =Mean amplitude= A post-stack attribute that computes the arithmetic mean of the amplitudes of a trace within a specified window. This can be used to observe the trace bias which could indicate the presence of a bright spot. =Average Energy= A post-stack attribute that computes the sum of the squared amplitudes divided by the number of samples within the specified window used. This provides a measure of reflectivity and allows one to map direct hydrocarbon indicators within a zone of interest. =RMS (root mean square) amplitude= A post-stack attribute that computes the square root of the sum of squared amplitudes divided by the number of samples within the specified window used. With this root mean square amplitude, one can measure reflectivity in order to map direct hydrocarbon indicators in a zone of interest. However, RMS is sensitive to noise as it squares every value within the window. =Maximum magnitude= A post-stack attribute that computes the maximum value of the absolute value of the amplitudes within a window. This can be used to map the strongest direct hydrocarbon indicator within a zone of interest. =AVO attributes= AVO (amplitude versus offset) attributes are pre-stack attributes that have as the basis for their computation, the variation in amplitude of a seismic reflection with varying offset. These attributes include: AVO intercept, AVO gradient, intercept multiplied by gradient, far minus near, fluid factor, etc. =Anelastic attenuation factor= The anelastic attenuation factor (or Q) is a seismic attribute that can be determined from seismic reflection data for both reservoir characterisation and advanced seismic processing. Time/Horizon attributes =Coherence= A post-stack attribute that measures the continuity between seismic traces in a specified window along a picked horizon. It can be used to map the lateral extent of a formation. It can also be used to see faults, channels or other discontinuous features. Although it should be used along a specified horizon, many software packages compute this attribute along arbitrary time-slices. =Dip= A post-stack attribute that computes, for each trace, the best fit plane (3D) or line (2D) between its immediate neighbor traces on a horizon and outputs the magnitude of dip (gradient) of said plane or line measured in degrees. This can be used to create a pseudo paleogeologic map on a horizon slice. =Azimuth= A post-stack attribute that computes, for each trace, the best fit plane (3D) between its immediate neighbor traces on a horizon and outputs the direction of maximum slope (dip direction) measured in degrees, clockwise from north. This is not to be confused with the geological concept of azimuth, which is equivalent to strike and is measured 90¬∞ counterclockwise from the dip direction. =Curvature= A group of post-stack attributes that are computed from the curvature of a specified horizon. These attributes include: magnitude or direction of maximum curvature, magnitude or direction of minimum curvature, magnitude of curvature along the horizon's azimuth (dip) direction, magnitude of curvature along the horizon's strike direction, magnitude of curvature of a contour line along a horizon. Frequency attributes These attributes involve separating and classifying seismic events within each trace based on their frequency content. The application of these attributes is commonly called spectral decomposition. The starting point of spectral decomposition is to decompose each 1D trace from the time domain into its corresponding 2D representation in the time- frequency domain by means of any method of time-frequency decomposition such as: short-time Fourier transform, continuous wavelet transform, Wigner-Ville distribution, matching pursuit, among many others. Once each trace has been transformed into the time-frequency domain, a bandpass filter can be applied to view the amplitudes of seismic data at any frequency or range of frequencies. Technically, each individual frequency or band of frequencies could be considered an attribute. The seismic data is usually filtered at various frequency ranges in order to show certain geological patterns that may not be obvious in the other frequency bands. There is an inverse relationship between the thickness of a rock layer and the corresponding peak frequency of its seismic reflection. That is, thinner rock layers are much more apparent at higher frequencies and thicker rock layers are much more apparent at lower frequencies. This can be used to qualitatively identify thinning or thickening of a rock unit in different directions. Spectral decomposition has also been widely used as a direct hydrocarbon indicator.

The canal connects at both ends to the River Ill, thus surrounding the Grande √éle that lies at the historic centre of the city. The canal was originally an arm of the River Ill. Initially the bank on the inner, or city, side of the arm was fortified. In the thirteenth century a further wall was built along the middle of the channel. This fortified wall became known as the Faux Rempart or false rampart. Between 1831 and 1832, the mayor Fr√©d√©ric de Turckheim removed the Faux Rempart in order to \\"allow a spacious navigation channel and freight transport within the city.\\" In 1840, the canal was opened to navigation. In its length, the canal is crossed by 13 bridges, and passes through a single lock. Navigation is officially restricted to passenger trip boats only, which operate frequent circular cruises round the Grande √éle and through the historic Petite France district of the city.

Description The wingspan is 4.0-6.6 mm. Adults are on wing in August, October and from January to March. There are two or more generations per year. Biology The larvae feed on shrubby species of Hypericum species (St. John's worts), including Hypericum beanii, H. henryii, H. hookerianum, H. uralum, and possibly H. petiolulatum and H. oblongifolium. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine consists of a very long, narrow, and sinuous gallery, often following the leaf margin, with black to brown linear frass, abruptly widening into a blotch with scattered brown frass, usually concentrated in the centre and adhering to the upper epidermis. The later mine is swollen. The larva spins a cocoon inside a prepared silken tunnel, which leads to an exit slit, which the larva makes prior to spinning its cocoon.

Plot California fruit picker Paul Rodriguez hopes to someday have a farm of his own. When his friend Lopo Chavez has a car accident, he is insulted with a racial slur by Joe Ferguson, a passenger in the other car. Joe's father disapproves of this bigotry. Lopo visits his friend Sunny Garcia, whose family publishes a Spanish-language paper called La Luz. At a dance, Sunny is introduced to Larry Wilder, editor of \\"The Union\\", who once was a big-city newspaper reporter. A racially heated fight breaks out at the dance. Paul accidentally strikes Peters, a policeman. Joe is also arrested. A reporter who works for Larry depicts the incident to a Stockton paper as a full-scale race riot. Reporter Jan Dawson arrives to pursue the story. Peters roughs up Paul in the back seat of the police car. His partner tries to intervene but crashes the car and dies. Paul flees. A dragnet for him begins. It intensifies when a teen farm girl, Mildred, startled at seeing Paul, falls and is knocked unconscious, after which she blames Paul for what happened.

By 2010, Cumberland acquired all rights to the brand in the US, making it the sole owner and marketer in the country. Once based in Chelsea and Newton, Massachusetts, Gulf Oil LP then shared its headquarters with Cumberland Farms in Framingham, Massachusetts. In 2015, Cumberland sold the company to ArcLight Capital Partners and moved the company to its own office in Wellesley Hills, Massachusetts. History Gulf pumps in Islip, NY In 1986, convenience store operator Cumberland Farms purchased a license for North American rights to the Gulf brand from Chevron. Chevron still owned the Gulf brand, but made little use of it by 2006. Cumberland Farms then operated about 500 gas stations and 20 refined petroleum terminals; it was licensed to use Gulf trademarks and names in 11 states. In 1993, Cumberland Farms entered a joint venture with Catamount Petroleum LP, forming Gulf Oil Limited Partnership with Cumberland owning a two-thirds interest.GOLP website: details of GOLP operation Cumberland since acquired the company in full. There were also some independently owned franchises operating under the Gulf brand in North America, including American Refining Group, which is licensed by Chevron to blend and distribute Gulf-branded lubricants. cobranded with 7-Eleven in Ellwood City, Pennsylvania, 2010 Gulf Oil has sponsored major sporting events in New York City, Boston, Manchester, Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh. In June 2008, Gulf had 1800 stations in the northeastern US; Gulf Oil LP agreed to supply the approximately 600 Exxon stations in New England and New York in a deal with ConocoPhillips. The deal included Cumberland Farms buying 200 Exxon stations, but intended to keep the name. That month, The Boston Globe reported that Gulf Oil LP (which had purchased the delivery contracts for over 500 Exxon stations in 2003 after the ExxonMobil merger required divestment) wanted to buy Mobil-branded company- owned stations in the Northeast. ExxonMobil sold 820 owned-and-operated stations, plus about 1400 leased stations. Then, Gulf was the only large local brand in New England, where it had 2000 stations, supplying about 500 stations with other names, for a market share of 10 percent. The 2003 deal gave Gulf Oil exclusive rights to the Exxon name in New York and New England until February 2010, when \\"Exxon\\" would be dropped. However, in 2008 Gulf Oil decided to stop using the Exxon name in February 2009, asking independent stations to switch to Gulf. The Enterprise of Brockton, Massachusetts reported in April 2008 that Verc Enterprises would change 14 Exxon stations in Massachusetts and New Hampshire to Gulf, but not its five Mobils. The Massachusetts Turnpike Authority announced in summer 2007 a switch of eleven former Exxon stations on the Massachusetts Turnpike to Gulf, and in 2009 the same change was extended to 158 Cumberland Farms-owned stations, the Globe said. Gulf supplied 300 other Exxons, of which 200 would likely change to Gulf. Many of the former Exxon stations feature a rectangular logo that fit into the existing sign standards used by Exxon. Gulf refers to the look as its \\"sunrise\\" imaging. Furthering public exposure, in 2009, the clothing store chain \\"Old Navy\\" began selling T-shirts bearing the old Gulf logo, along with the former logos of Standard Oil and Chevron. Standalone Gulf station in Houston, Texas, 2012 In December 2009, Chevron USA announced it would no longer serve 1100 stations in 13 states. On January 12, 2010, after using the name since 1986, the Gulf Oil partnership acquired all right, title and interest in the Gulf brand name in the United States and announced plans to expand the use of the Gulf brand beyond eleven states from Ohio to Delaware and northeastward. Chevron USA had the rights to the Gulf name elsewhere but used Chevron or Texaco in those areas. The first areas where Gulf would expand would be those Chevron and Texaco stations included in the 2009 announcement. Later, The Pantry of Cary, North Carolina would likely consider the Gulf name, according to Gulf Oil COO Ron Sabia, though Pantry officials did not comment on such a possibility. On March 10, 2010, Gulf Oil announced an agreement with Somerset Petroleum to change nine stations to Gulf, five of them Chevron, giving Kentucky its first Gulf stations since 1990. Gulf Oil formed a partnership with Milo Cockerham Inc. to return the Gulf name to Virginia for the first time since 1986. Chevron stations in the southwestern part of the state will make the change in July 2010.

It begins at an at-grade intersection with US 6 and SH 93 in Golden and ends in Wheat Ridge. It is a freeway for its entire length except for its west junction, which is a signal light. The entire route is known as the Golden Freeway. Route description Mount Zion The freeway begins at the junction with U.S. Highway 6 and State Highway 93 in Golden with a traffic signal. It then heads eastward as a freeway and interchanges with Washington Avenue, and after about a mile, it leaves the city of Golden. After another half mile, after having a westbound exit only with Boyd Street, it briefly enters and leaves the Golden city limit. After crossing over the Croke Canal, it has an exit at McIntyre Street. After entering the Wheat Ridge city limit, the route ends at a three-level interchange with Interstate 70. The Iron Horse Motel at 17115 W. 44th Ave (closed) and the Colorado Railroad Museum at 17155 W. 44th Avenue are on the old SH 58 or 44th Avenue. 44th Avenue was State Highway 58 before the highway designation was assigned to the current route south of W. 44th Ave. Most of the current road is in unincorporated Jefferson County bounded by Wheat Ridge and Golden. The Coors property runs from McIntyre St. to Ford St. in Golden on the south side of SH 58. History The route was established in the 1920s, with a western terminus at SH 119 north of Blackhawk and an eastern terminus at Federal Boulevard near Denver. A small business loop was added from Blackhawk to the intersection of SH 58 and SH 119. = Freeway bypass = In 1955, Jefferson County announced plans for a four-lane freeway between US 6 in Golden and the Valley Highway in Denver, approximately following West 44th Avenue from Golden to Mount Olivet Cemetery and West 48th Avenue to the Valley Highway, which the Golden Chamber of Commerce endorsed as beneficial to the city's economy and traffic conditions. The Colorado Department of Highways (CDH) adopted the West 48th Avenue portion of the corridor for Interstate 70, and, by 1958, had adopted the West 44th Avenue corridor for a realignment of SH 58, but had not allocated funding to it. Over the following years, the city and county continued to request funds for the project, and, in 1963, CDH budgeted to begin construction of the new SH 58. By this year, the east end of the highway had been cut back to Sheridan Boulevard. An alignment for the freeway through Golden along Seventh Street was chosen in 1964 over a less costly routing along Tenth Street, with plans for a full diamond interchange at Washington Avenue and westbound right- in/right-out access from the Sunshine Park neighborhood. In August 1964, the state began acquiring the right-of-way for the first segment of the freeway between US 6 and Ford Street, including twenty-three homes and the former \\"Governor's Mansion.\\" By 1967, the segment of SH 58 between Wadsworth and Sheridan Boulevards had been removed from the state highway system. The freeway was completed in Golden by 1968, and CDH advanced plans to extend the it to a recently completed segment of I-70 near Youngfield Street, bypassing West 44th Avenue. The design called for an entrance ramp from West 44th Avenue, a full diamond interchange at McIntyre Street, and a partial interchange at I-70. Although the county proposed additional ramps between SH 58 and I-70, they were rejected due to the cost of additional bridges over Clear Creek and concerns over their proximity to other ramps on I-70. In May 1973, the freeway between Golden and I-70 opened to traffic, and the bypassed section of West 44th Avenue was removed from the state highway system. = Later development = The SH 93 Golden Bypass opened in July 1991, realigning SH 93 to meet US 6 and SH 58 at an at-grade intersection in west Golden. This intersection replaced an interchange between US 6 and SH 58 at the same location. In 2002, in anticipation of development in the area, CDOT proposed adding ramps to the I-70/SH 58 interchange for the movements that were not included in its initial construction. After Wheat Ridge annexed land southwest of the interchange for a Cabela's-anchored development in 2005, the city and CDOT studied additional transportation network changes in the area; the recommended alternative included a new interchange on SH 58 at Cabela Drive, the development's primary road, connecting Holman Street on the north to West 32nd Avenue at Zinnia Street. The new ramps between I-70 and SH 58 were completed in December 2008, but, following Cabela's withdrawal from the development, the Holman Street interchange was not constructed. CDOT began a project to replace the bridge over Ford Street in Golden in 2013. During construction, the temporary closure of the nearby \\"fishhook\\" entrance ramp from Clearview Parkway east of Boyd Street was made permanent with support from the Golden city council. A berm was installed in the ramp's place to reduce highway noise in the adjacent Sunshine Park neighborhood. In 2016, Evergreen Devco Inc. purchased the Cabela's parcel west of I-70 to develop under the name Clear Creek Crossing. Coors Brewing Company retained ownership of the northern parcels adjacent to SH 58, and, without plans to develop them, CDOT and the Federal Highway Administration determined the Holman Street interchange would not be necessary to handle the anticipated traffic levels; however, the layout of Clear Creek Crossing allows for the connection to be made if the northern parcels are developed in the future.

The mill was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 25, 1996. Description and history Sandwiched between the Yantic River and the limited-access highway carrying Connecticut Route 2, the mill is connected to the river by Yantic Road. Its main building is a large 4-1/2 story ashlar stone structure with a five-story square tower at its center. The tower was originally capped by an octagonal belfry, which has not survived. The main mill is connected to a series of smaller buildings, also stone. The mill was powered by water delivered from the river via a stone headrace that ran from a dam (no longer standing) about to the northwest. The mill complex dates to 1865, when it was built by E. Winslow Williams on the site of an older mill, built by his father, which had been destroyed by fire. The mill was the economic engine of Yantic well into the 20th century, with textile production ending in 1989. It originally produced flannel, employing 150 workers at its peak output. The village that surrounds the mill has been reduced in size, with the owner's house and tracts of worker housing demolished to make way for the construction of Connecticut Route 2.

Storyline =Two tribes= After discovering that the witch Circe caused her island home to disappear, Wonder Woman forced her to return the island and her fellow Amazons to their original location. When she goes to the island she discovers the buildings demolished and is shot at with an arrow by an unknown assailant. Wonder Woman, also known as Diana, then finds her Amazon sisters and is told what had happened to the island during its disappearance. She is told that during one past night the island was invaded by an outside Amazon tribe called the Amazons of Bana- Mighdall. A huge tribal war was held lasting several days for command of the island. During the battle the witch Circe appeared in the skies above the island revealing that she was responsible for the Amazons appearing on the island and that she meant to destroy both tribes by then sending the island to a dimension of demons. Once this was done a legion of demons began to attack and devour the Amazons. Seeing the situation for what it was, the warring Amazons temporarily put their rivalries aside so that they could properly defend themselves against the demons. This way of life lasted until the island was magically transported back to its original location. Surprisingly to Diana, although the island was gone for a few short months, the length of time the island remained in the demon dimension lasted 10 years. While Diana was happy to see her mother Queen Hippolyta alive and whole, Hippolyta's demeanor was cold and withdrawn, even in the presence of her daughter. When Hippolyta asked how much progress Diana has made in the outside world as Wonder Woman, she became angry and hostile to her daughter when Diana told her that the process was a lot slower than expected. Because of this Hippolyta announced that a new Contest would be held for a new Wonder Woman to be sent in Diana's place. =Enter: Artemis= Angered and confused, Diana went to her friend Mala for some solice. While talking to her Diana found herself the target for another arrow. She followed the arrow's origin point and found a group of Bana-Mighdallian Amazons having an archery contest. She asks who was the owner of the arrow shot at her earlier and finds that it belonged to the Bana Amazon named Artemis. Artemis tells Diana that the arrow was misdirected but tells her that she has no love for the Themyscirian tribe. Through a yelling match Diana discovers that the reason why the Bana Amazons were teleported to the island by Circe is because they agreed to work for her during the War of the Gods period in exchange for immortality and a new homeland. (Diana caused the original city of Bana-Mighdall to be destroyed during an earlier story arc.)Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #29-35 Not wishing to start another war, one of the Bana Amazons ends the argument and invites Diana to participate in their archery contest. They find that Diana and Artemis are evenly matched on the archery field. Later Artemis confronts Diana yet again when she finds a posting by Queen Hippolyta stating that the Amazons of Bana-Mighdall are not allowed to participate in the Contest to find the new Wonder Woman. Diana tells Artemis that she was unaware of the post and accompanies Artemis into the Bana camp, which is located in the harshest corner of the island. There she finds the new tribe living in base conditions. When she tries to interact with the Amazons she finds both hate and an unspoken awe at her presence. The Bana's \\"Keeper\\" or historian then invites Diana and Artemis to see their tribe's most sacred relic: a bust of the tribe's founding queen Antiope, Diana's long dead aunt. Upon seeing the bust Diana is surprised to discover that Queen Antiope looks exactly like Diana. When the new Contest to find a new Wonder Woman goes underway a group of Bana Amazons appear. Among them is Diana's newest friend and rival, Artemis. Queen Hippolyta asks why they are there and Diana tells her that she invited them. Diana then turns to her fellow tribe of Amazons and asks for a vote of the whole to see if the Bana Amazons should be allowed in the Contest or not. The majority of Diana's tribe agree, thus out voting Queen Hippolyta's rule. Hippolyta grudgingly submits. Unknown to Diana, Hippolyta has her Army General Philippus create magical traps on the obstacle courses to better cause Diana trouble in winning. She also has the Amazon sorceress Magala transfer half of Diana's powers to the unaware Amazon Artemis so that she has a better chance of winning the title. During one of the Contest trials another arrow is fired at Diana, this time by an unknown assailant. Seeing the arrow, Artemis uses her newfound speed to leap into the air and catch the arrow before it could strike Diana. As the assassin had left the area immediately after firing the arrow, the Amazons present were unable to discover who the archer was. Later that night Artemis confronts a Bana Amazon named Patrice in private. Artemis pins her to a tree and tells her that she recognized Patrice's arrow fletching. Patrice admits that she was the one who shot the arrow at Diana but says that she did it so that Artemis could win the Contest, thereby causing their tribe to regain their honor among the Amazon nation. Artemis then reprimands Patrice telling her that no Bana Amazon will win the Contest as she believes Hippolyta only initiated the Contest to somehow punish Diana. She tells her that Diana will probably win the Contest but that if the Bana tribe makes a good showing during the trials that they could prove their honorable favor in the eyes of the other tribe. She further states that spilling royal blood would only cause more war for their people. As Patrice apologizes to Artemis, Diana can be seen listening in to their conversation from a hidden location. =History revealed= While resting between Contest tournaments, Diana begins to have strange visions of being in her aunt Antiope's body 3,000 years earlier, during the time the Amazons were invaded by the Olympian barbarian Herakles. In the visions she sees that after Herakles had drugged and enslaved the Amazons that Queen Hippolyta refused to fight against Herakles because she loved him. Angered by Hippolyta's inaction Antiope took charge and used an item called the Mask of Proteus to magically disguise herself as Herakles. In his form she commanded Herakles' men to free the Amazons. After doing this the Amazons reclaimed their city. Disgusted by her sister, Antiope left Hippolyta (taking half the Amazons with her) and went to find revenge against Herakles and his lackey Theseus. Antiope told Hippolyta before leaving that she could never trust her again. In the last tournament of the Contest, which consisted of a race, Diana was slowed down by magical copies of ancient creatures along the way: the whirlpool Charybdis, Medusa and Harpies. Because Diana had to stop these creatures from not only destroying herself but also those around her, Artemis was able to surpass Diana and win the Contest. As gifts to Artemis for winning, Queen Hippolyta gave her the Lasso of Truth, Hermes' winged sandals which allowed her to fly, and the Gauntlets of Atlas which increase its wearer's strength by 10. Hippolyta also announced that she considered Artemis to be her daughter and gave her Diana's royal tiara to wear during her duration as Wonder Woman. Content that Diana no longer carried the Wonder Woman title, Hippolyta pulled Diana aside and told her that she is to be groomed to preside as Queen over the new tribe of Amazons. Still angered at her mother and by the Contest's outcome, Diana revealed the Bust of Antiope to a surprised Hippolyta. Diana confronted Hippolyta as to why she looked exactly like her aunt and with the revelation that she knew about Antiope and Hippolyta's last meeting. Shocked, Hippolyta said the story was a lie. Diana failed to believe her and asked her if Herakles was really her father. Before she could answer Diana left her mother behind, similar to the way Antiope had so many centuries prior. Diana then left the island all together in order to return to her outworld life in Boston. In Boston a media crew is seen filming a super human attack. They are surprised to see Artemis wearing the Wonder Woman uniform and Diana, aiding her, in a new black outfit.

It is a grist mill located astride Briggs Brook between bridges carrying the eastbound and westbound lanes of Interstate 95. The mill was established in 1650, and the complex retains elements that are believed to be original to its construction. It is now owned by the city and the grounds are open daily; the mill itself is open for tours by special appointment. The property was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 30, 1982. Description and history The Winthrop Mill is located north of downtown New London, on Mill Street, a short road between State Pier Road and Winthrop Street. The site is located on Briggs Brook, and is overshadowed by the high bridges carrying I-95 overhead. The mill building is a 1-1/2 story gambrel-roofed wood frame structure, measuring about . The roof flares out over the front to include a porch, supported by four square posts. The exterior of the building is finished in horizontal boarding that gives rough clapboard-like flushboard finish. Attached to the west wall is the mill's waterwheel. It is powered by water delivered from an elevated wooden penstock, which receives water from a gate at a small dam on the brook upstream from the mill. The penstock is about long, and is supported by wooden trestles mounted on stone piers. The interior of the mill contains a mix of modern and old finishes, and retains only a portion of the machinery needed to operate it properly. The first mill was supposedly established on this site in 1650 by Governor John Winthrop, Jr. and William Comstock. The property remained in Winthrop family hands until the late 18th century. Some elements of the mill infrastructure may be very nearly original to the period of first use, notably the elevated flume, wheel pit, and tail race. The present building may also include elements of the original, although it is known that the mill was set afire during Benedict Arnold's 1781 raid on New London and Groton. The property went through a succession of owners until 1892, when it was acquired by the city. It was leased for commercial operation until 1913, and underwent a major rehabilitation in 1960.

Guided wave testing (GWT) is a non-destructive evaluation method. The method employs acoustic waves that propagate along an elongated structure while guided by its boundaries. This allows the waves to travel a long distance with little loss in energy. Nowadays, GWT is widely used to inspect and screen many engineering structures, particularly for the inspection of metallic pipelines around the world. In some cases, hundreds of meters can be inspected from a single location. There are also some applications for inspecting rail tracks, rods and metal plate structures. Although guided wave testing is also commonly known as guided wave ultrasonic testing (GWUT) or ultrasonic guided waves (UGWs) or long range ultrasonic testing (LRUT), it is fundamentally very different from conventional ultrasonic testing. The frequency used in the inspection depends on the thickness of the structure, but guided wave testing typically uses ultrasonic frequencies in the range of 10 kHz to several MHz. Higher frequencies can be used in some cases, but detection range is significantly reduced. In addition, the underlying physics of guided waves is more complex than bulk waves. Much of the theoretical background has been addressed in a separate article. In this article, the practical aspect of GWT will be discussed.  History  The study of guided waves propagating in a structure can be traced back to as early as the 1920s, mainly inspired by the field of seismology. Since then, there has been an increased effort on the analytical study of guided wave propagation in cylindrical structures. It was only in the early 1990s that guided wave testing was considered as a practical method for the non-destructive testing of engineering structures. Today, GWT is applied as an integrated health monitoring program in the oil, gas and chemical industries.  How it works (pipeline inspections)  thumbright300px A technician (right) performs a Guided Wave test. An example of pipeline inspection using guided wave testing (GWT). Mechanical stress wave is generated via transducer array mounted around the pipe surface. The electrical signal is driven by the portable electronic unit. After the collection, the result is displayed on the computer for further analysis. A typical example of the GWT data showing both the A-scan type (bottom) and the C-scan type (top) results. The green band indicates the position of the transducer array. Unlike conventional ultrasonics, there are an infinite number of guided wave modes that exist for a pipe geometry, and they can be generally grouped into three families, namely the torsional, longitudinal and flexural modes. The acoustic properties of these wave modes are a function of the pipe geometry, the material and the frequency. Predicting these properties of the wave modes often relies on heavy mathematical modeling which is typically presented in graphical plots called dispersion curves. In the guided wave testing of pipelines, an array of low frequency transducers is attached around the circumference of the pipe to generate an axially symmetric wave that propagates along the pipe in both the forward and backward directions of the transducer array. The torsional wave mode is most commonly used, although there is limited use of the longitudinal mode. The equipment operates in a pulse-echo configuration where the array of transducers is used for both the excitation and detection of the signals. At a location where there is a change of cross-section or a change in local stiffness of the pipe, an echo is generated. Based on the arrival time of the echoes, and the predicted speed of the wave mode at a particular frequency, the distance of a feature in relation to the position of the transducer array can be accurately calculated. GWT uses a system of distance amplitude curves (DAC) to correct for attenuation and amplitude drops when estimating the cross-section change (CSC) from a reflection at a certain distance. The DACs are usually calibrated against a series of echoes with known signal amplitude such as weld echoes. Once the DAC levels are set, the signal amplitude correlates well to the CSC of a defect. GWT does not measure the remaining wall thickness directly, but it is possible to group the defect severity in several categories. One method of doing this is to exploit the mode conversion phenomenon of the excitation signal where some energy of the axially symmetric wave mode is converted to the flexural modes at a pipe feature. The amount of mode conversion provides an accurate estimate of the circumferential extent of the defect, and together with the CSC, operators could establish the severity category. A typical result of GWT is displayed in an A-scan style with the reflection amplitude against the distance from the transducer array position. In the past few years, some advanced systems have started to offer C-scan type results where the orientation of each feature can be easily interpreted. This has shown to be extremely useful when inspecting large size pipelines.  Guided wave focusing  As well as incorporating C-scan type results, active focusing capacity can also be achieved by GWT utilising flexural wave modes. This gives two main advantages; firstly the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of a defect echo can be enhanced, secondly it can be used as an additional tool to help discriminate between 'real' and 'false' indications. However, there are disadvantages associated with this technique; firstly, the defect location must be known before the focusing can be applied, secondly, the separate data set required for the active focusing technique can also significantly reduce the time and cost efficiency of GWT. Flexural wave modes have sinusoidal variation in their displacement pattern around the circumference, in integer values ranging from 1 to Infinity. Active focusing involves the transmission of multiple flexural wave modes, with time and amplitude corrections applied, in such a way that a circumferential node from each wave mode will arrive at the target position at the same time, the same circumferential position and with the same phase, causing constructive interference. At other circumferential positions the circumferential nodes of the flexural wave modes will arrive out of phase with each other and will interfere destructively. Adjusting the excitation conditions can rotate this focal spot around the pipes circumference. Comparing the response from different circumferential positions can allow the operator to more accurately predict the circumferential position and extent of a defect. The active focusing technique gives information on the circumferential distribution of metal loss defects. The two defects shown both represent the same cross sectional loss, however, the defect at -3m is much more severe as it fully penetrates the pipe wall. As previously mentioned, the focusing technique can also be used to help discriminate between 'real' and 'false' indications, a 'false' indication being a received signal that does not directly correspond to the position of a defect; such as those from reverberations or from incomplete cancellation of unwanted wave modes. If a 'false' indication is present in the A-scan data, it will also be re- represented in any C-scan type results as this type of processing uses the same original data. As active focusing involves a separate data collection, focusing at the position of a 'false' indication will give a negative result, whereas focusing on a 'true' indication will give a positive result. Therefore, the active focusing technique can help overcome the propensity of 'false calls' generated by guided wave testing systems.

In 1818, the land for the store was purchased by Gurdon Bill and his partner, Philip Gray. In 1819, Gray sold his interest in the store for $500. Bill operated the store until his death in 1856 and the store is believed to have made its final transaction in 1868. It has not been used since it was sold to the Congregational Society in 1875, retaining its historical integrity. The store is an by -story gable-roofed clapboarded structure built upon fieldstone and stone blocks. It has some unusual architecture in the form of a pent-roof and three-part window shutters. Clouette describes the store as \\"the best preserved early 19th-century store known in Connecticut.\\" The Gurdon Bill Store was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 12, 1982.  Design  The Gurdon Bill Store is named for Gurdon Bill, who was born in 1784. The land was originally purchased by Bill and his partner, Philip Gray, in 1818. Clouette notes that four years later, Bill was the sole owner of the property; a record from 1819 says Gray sold his interest in the store to Bill for $500. Bill continued to run the store until shortly before his death in 1856. At age 21, Bill went to Plainfield Academy and later went on to work with various merchants before setting up the store in North Groton, later incorporated as Ledyard, Connecticut. Clouette notes a brief passage of the store out of the Bill family, soon reacquired, before it was sold to the Congregational Society in 1875. The Congregational Society has made limited use of the store, preserving its historical integrity. Local historians speculate that the store's final transaction was made in 1868; afterwards the store was boarded up and left essentially unused. Built in 1818, the Gurdon Bill Store is a by -story clapboarded store. The walls extend higher up than the ceiling to an attic for additional storage space. The wood-shingled gable roof also has a smaller pent roof on the front facade that projects about beyond the wall, which is unusual in New England architecture. The foundation of the store is built upon fieldstone and has stone blocks above the ground; the store has a full cellar. The main facade has two large twelve-by-twelve light sliding sash windows on the left side that can be covered with three- part batten shutters. The main door is a Dutch door with a plain frame and to its right is a smaller six-by-six sash window without a batten shutter. The rear facade is plain and devoid of any windows. The north end of has four windows, two for the attic, and the south end has only two windows for the attic, all with six-over-six sash. The interior consists of one large room on the south end, from the main entrance, and two smaller connecting rooms on the north. The walls of the main room have wide-board horizontal panels and a large L-shaped counter running parallel to the south and west walls. Behind the counter are tiers of pine shelving and on the west wall are built-in drawers with simple wooden pulls and open bins on the bottom. The east wall has a plank bench. The two connected rooms on the north are similar with both having \\"plastered walls, a narrow beaded board for pegs or hooks, simple sliding shutters on the windows, beaded post casings, and brick diagonal fireplaces.\\"  Importance  Clouette writes, \\"The Gurdon Bill Store is the best preserved early 19th-century store known in Connecticut. There are earlier store buildings and more elegant ones, but it would appear that the Bill Store is unique in retaining so many of its original features intact, particularly in the interior.\\" It was submitted to the National Historic Register of Places under criteria A for being a \\"country store\\" which supplied items that local farmers needed, but could not produce or manufacture. The building also was submitted for its well-adapted and well-preserved architectural integrity. The store also has an unusual pent-roof and three- part window shutters, the purpose of which is not entirely known. Locally, the Gurdon Bill Store was rumored to have been a tavern or an inn, although no evidence or record indicates such a use, and it was apparently a waystation for stagecoaches. A historical marker in the immediate vicinity ties the Gurdon Bill store to the birthplace of Samuel Seabury, America's first Episcopal bishop. No conclusive evidence for this claim exists.

It was produced by Left Bank Pictures for Sky1. The cast of Strike Back is led by Richard Armitage and Andrew Lincoln, also starring Orla Brady, Shelley Conn, Colin Salmon and Jodhi May, including a variety of guest appearances including Toby Stephens, Ewen Bremner, Dhaffer L'Abidine, Shaun Parkes and Alexander Siddig. The series follows John Porter (Armitage), a former British Special Forces soldier, who is drafted back into service by Section 20, a fictional branch of the Defence Intelligence (DI) of the Ministry of Defence. The series ran on a multi- million pound budget, and was filmed on location in South Africa, particularly in Gauteng. Ryan became a series consultant. Strike Back commenced airing on 5 May 2010 with two episodes showing a week. The first episode received unofficial overnight ratings of almost 400,000 viewers in the United Kingdom, which increased to just over one million according to the more highly regarded Broadcasters' Audience Research Board. It was met with generally positive reviews; comments of the series ranged from a positive \\"British action series that packs a Die Hard-style thrill around every corner,\\" to a more negative \\"pathetic male fantasy\\". It was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on 7 June 2010. A 10-part second series, known as Strike Back: Project Dawn, a co- production between Sky and the American network Cinemax, was first broadcast in August 2011. A third series of Strike Back, also consisting of 10 parts, was released in August 2012. Following success of the second through fourth series, Cinemax began airing the six-part series starting 25 October 2013 in the United States. It is airing as a prequel in the U.S. since Cinemax aired Strike Back: Project Dawn, Strike Back: Vengeance, and Strike Back: Shadow Warfare prior to the first season. Episodes In this table, the number in the first column refers to the episode's number within the entire series, \\"UK viewers in millions\\" refers to how many Britons watched the episode on Sky1. The series plays out as three two-part episodes. Cast and characters Richard Armitage portrays series protagonist, John Porter. *Richard Armitage plays series protagonist John Porter. Porter served with the SAS until he was discharged after he spared the life of a boy who was believed to have subsequently killed two soldiers in his unit following a rescue operation the night before the Iraq invasion. He is brought back into service by Section 20 seven years later. He is married to Diane, and has a daughter, Alexandra. Armitage described Porter as a \\"damaged hero\\", and \\"sort of like Lucas North, only on some kind of go-faster drug.\\" In order to fit into the role, Armitage had to \\"bulk up for the role,\\" and performed a lot of training for about ten weeks in the UK, and then flew to Johannesburg the day after filming the eighth series of Spooks wrapped up, where he proceeded with more training. He was trained from \\"how to hold a gun to how you can run through a door without getting your head blown off.\\" Armitage had not trained as hard as in the past; the intensity of such training almost made him pass out after the first workout, stating \\"filming Spooks is demanding, but nowhere near as physical as this.\\" Armitage performed most of his own stunts. *Andrew Lincoln plays Hugh Collinson, former soldier in Porter's unit and has since become the head of Section 20. Lincoln was signed onto the role because he thought the series was a \\"great story\\", and that his character was \\"completely re-written from the book.\\" Out of the cast, the weapons instructor told Lincoln that he was the most instinctive he ever worked with. *Orla Brady plays Katie Dartmouth, a British war correspondent who was kidnapped in Basra by the \\"Sword of Islam\\", an Iraqi terrorist group. To play Dartmouth, Brady used her inspiration from real life BBC war correspondent Orla Guerin. During the filming of Dartmouth's holding, a male stand-in with a wig was used as a stunt double. The crew also added oil and dirt on Brady's hair every morning. Brady stated that she liked playing extremes, and thought Dartmouth is \\"grown up\\" compared to Siobhan Dhillion, the character Brady portrayed in Mistresses. *Shelley Conn plays Danni Prendiville, an officer with Section 20. Porter started an affair with her after he was redrafted into service. She signed on for the role because she \\"thought the concept of the scripts was very clever and once I heard who was involved it didn't take me long to sign up.\\" In researching for her role, Conn had somewhat of a military background since her father and uncle both served in the British Army, and had since had a base understanding of military life. *Colin Salmon plays James Middleton, a civil servant who sits between the British government and the Ministry of Defence. Salmon previously worked with Sky1 on Hex. He was attracted to the role in Strike Back due to the script being \\"a page-turner, and they're rare. It's really lovely to sit down to start reading something and then not be able to stop because you have to know what's going to happen next,\\" as well as hearing of who was involved in the project. A member of The Prince's Trust charity, Salmon took the opportunity to visit some of their projects in Soweto while the series was filmed. *Jodhi May plays Layla Thompson, a lieutenant in military intelligence and works alongside Collinson in Section 20. At first, she came to resent Porter, but starts opening up to him after she grows some distrust towards Collinson. May described Thompson as an \\"incredibly challenging, assertive and ambitious woman working in a male-dominated field that she's climbed to the top of.\\" She was drawn into appear in the series because of the respect she has with Andy Harries and Left Bank Productions. May knew people who work in the same world her character does, and talked with them to conduct some research into her role, as well as reading on the subject. The first series was also given a variety of guest appearances. Among them include Nicola Stephenson (Diane Porter), Laura Greenwood (Alexandra Porter), Fenar Mohammed Ali (As'ad), Dhaffer L'Abidine (Hakim Al Nazeri), Shaun Parkes (Felix Masuku), David Harewood (Colonel Tshuma), Toby Stephens (Frank Arlington) and Alexander Siddig (Zahar Sharq). Production The series was filmed on location in and around Johannesburg, South Africa. =Development= The inspiration for a television adaptation came when executive producer Andy Harries saw the novel while at an airport and took it on holiday with him. He did not manage to read it before returning to Britain, but pitched the idea to Sky's Head of Drama Elaine Pyke, who commissioned it anyway. Pyke and Harries had enthusiasm for the novel, and were excited to take up the challenge to adapt it for television. It was planned to be shot in high-definition because, according to Pyke; \\"Sky1 HD drama is about trying to astound audiences, up the creative bar, and commission shows which make audiences love being Sky subscribers.\\" After seeing the success from previous dramas such as Terry Pratchett's Hogfather and The Take, Sky made a multimillion-pound commitment to Strike Back. Harries commented that he \\"was interested in developing a quality action series out of the UK because it's something we don't do very often, but there's no reason why we shouldn't.\\" Richard Armitage called the series an \\"ambitious project for television. But the advantage of that is that these three feature films are linked together so you get a really interesting character arc through all episodes. American television is being brave and doing that at the moment, and this is stepping into that area.\\" Former SAS soldier and the original novel's author, Chris Ryan, served as the series consultant and script advisor. Chris Ryan stated; \\"When you produce a novel it's like a child and to see it put onto screen opens it up to a greater audience. I class myself as a storyteller now, and to tell that story on paper is a great privilege, then to see it on screen is even better.\\" =Preparation= As Strike Back is a military drama, the production crew used a vast catalogue of firearms, including side arms, assault and sniper rifles, as well as rocket-propelled grenades, hand grenades and other explosives. Cast members were first taught by carrying weights that mimicked the weight of the weapons so they could get used to carrying it during filming. Later, they were taught how to carry them professionally, including how to disassemble and re- assemble them, as well as how to fire and reload. Though the majority were actually rubber, duplicates were sometimes used for some of the background characters. Three ex-SAS soldiers gave the cast weapons and tactical training, and were also on hand to oversee how cast members carried the weapons during filming sessions. =Filming= Filming commenced in August 2009, and concluded by the end of the same year. It was filmed on location primarily in the Johannesburg area in South Africa, as well as the same Province the city is located, Gauteng. Other filming locations in the series include Northern Cape, Augrabies Falls National Park, and the Kalahari Desert. Harries wanted to film the series in South Africa because he worked there several times in the past, and knew the country can replicate anywhere in the world. One of the biggest problems for filming is the environmental impact they would cause, particularly with explosions. Location manager Jaco Espach often coordinated with a special effects team to use more environmentally friendly methods. In order to film sequences involving firearms and explosives in private property, the series crew often negotiated with property owners, as well as notifying all neighbouring properties, local police and the local hospital. In the city, leaflets were distributed to the filming location a week in advance. In airport scenes, the crew would inform the aviation authorities. The action sequences in the beginning of the first episode took five days to shoot, and was filmed in the Johannesburg suburb of Yeoville. On the scenes filmed on the Kalahari, filming temporarily halted due to the spotting of venomous snakes in the area. After they retreated from some rainfall, the crew swept the area to remove them and filming continued. Release and reception =Release and ratings= The series aired two episodes a week from 5 to 19 May 2010 in the United Kingdom. BBC Worldwide acquired distribution rights to broadcast the first series internationally. Episodes 1 and 2 received unofficial overnight ratings of 398,000 and 370,000 viewers, with an audience share of 1.7% and 2.1% respectively. Both episodes more than tripled Sky1's average audience share in their slots from the previous three months, and were also the third most-watched non-terrestrial viewing behind BBC Four's Timothy Spall: Somewhere at Sea and a live Sky Sports football game. The overnight figures for episodes 3 and 4 were down somewhat to 337,000 and 294,000 with an audience share of 1.4% and 1.5% respectively. The overnight ratings for the finale episodes were both 386,000 viewers, and received an audience share of 1.7% and 2.3% respectively. Strike Back was released on both DVD and Blu-ray Disc in the United Kingdom on 7 June 2010. Released by 2entertain, they contain all six episodes, as well as cast interviews and a Behind the Scenes featurette. =Critical reception= Overall, the reviews of the series were generally positive. Michael Conroy of GQ named Strike Back an \\"Editor's Pick\\" for its \\"excellent cinematography, stellar performances and a surprisingly balanced global perspective makes this story of two former British SAS soldiers a thoroughly enjoyable action romp.\\" Conroy compared the series to Green Zone, The Pacific and the Call of Duty video game series. Keith Watson of Metro called the series a \\"British action series that packs a Die Hard- style thrill around every corner.\\" Watson praised Armitage's performance, calling him perfect for the role, and that \\"for once in a British series, the action scenes kick some proper butt.\\" John Preston of The Daily Telegraph stated that Strike Back was \\"a slick affair, crisply directed by Daniel Percival, scripted with considerable sharpness by Jed Mercurio and full of belting action sequences.\\" Jack Foley of IndieLondon rated the first episodes four stars out of five, stating that it \\"made for exciting viewing even if the politics and the script sometimes proved laughably gung-ho and naive.\\" On review on the first two episodes, Jane Simon of The Mirror has said that between the cast, \\"there's enough shock and awe to make you very glad they're showing this in a double bill.\\" Gerard Gilbert of The Arts Desk dubbed Strike Back as \\"thin and lightweight next to [Armitage's other gig] Spooks\\", and although \\"not unexciting\\", Gilbert did not find the series interesting. Andrea Mullaney of The Scotsman was positive about the casting, and the changes in storyline from the original novel, though the series was aimed \\"squarely at the blokey viewer who'd rather watch paint dry than a costume drama.\\" Whilst also reviewing Luther and Lewis, John Lloyd of The Financial Times called it \\"fine for tension,\\" \\"good on sub-Bond dialogue\\" and that the story lines make Spooks look true to life. Lloyd also called Richard Armitage \\"one of the best action men on television.\\" The Guardian and The Independent have each released two separate reviews; they were more mixed. Sam Wollaston enjoyed the first two episodes, but called it a \\"pathetic male fantasy.\\" Andrew Anthony has said that \\"no scene lasted more than about 25 seconds in the first two episodes and no element of plot information was left unspoken. The dialogue is close to pure exposition, with an occasional clunkily macho line thrown in as a concession to dramatic atmosphere. Show, don't tell, say the screenwriting gurus. This was show and tell.\\" From The Independent, Tom Sutcliffe stated the series may be enjoyed by those who like explosions and Spooks-like operations. Rhiannon Harries was almost negative in her review, believing Strike Back was \\"in almost every respect, a terrible piece of television drama,\\" although part of Harries enjoyed watching it. Harries noted that Luther was more recommended.

Saxena (Kader Khan) is known for his parsimony. Everything he does and thinks is valued with money, and ways he can accumulate it. His daughter, Kiran (Ameesha Patel), is the opposite, a spendthrift. Mr. Saxena borrows money from elderly people, assuring them of returning the loan with a handsome rate of interest after about 20 years, knowing fully well that none of them will survive 20 years. Then he meets with the son of one of such lender, aptly named after him viz. Raj K. Saxena (Aftab). Mr. Saxena refuses to repay the amount, swallows the proof, the only evidence, and asks Raj to get out, which he does so. Raj is determined to get his money, and wants Kiran to fall in love with him. Kiran does so, and brings him over to introduce him to her shocked and speechless dad. Things change when Raj inherits a large amount of money, ironically left by Mr. Saxena maternal grandmother, and it is Mr. Saxena who is now anxious to get in the good books of Raj, with hilarious results.

This can be as simple as a flashlight cell connected through two wires to a light bulb or as involved as the space shuttle. Electrical systems are groups of electrical components connected to carry out some operation. Often the systems are combined with other systems. They might be subsystems of larger systems and have subsystems of their own. For example, a subway rapid transit electrical system is composed of the wayside electrical power supply, wayside control system, and the electrical systems of each transit car. Each transit car‚Äôs electrical system is a subsystem of the subway system. Inside of each transit car there are also subsystems, such as the car climate control system. Design The following would be appropriate for the design of a moderate to large electrical system. # A specification document is written. It probably would have been written by the customer. The specification document states in plain language and numerical detail what the customer expects. If it is well written, it will be used as a reference throughout the electrical system design. # A functional specification (design) document that goes into more technical details may be created. It uses the specification document as its basis. Here calculations may be used or referenced to support design decisions. # Functional diagrams may be made. These use block diagrams indicating information and electrical power flow from component to component. They are similar to the functional flow block diagrams used with computer programs. # Schematic diagrams showing the electrical interconnections between the components are made. They may not show all the conductors and termination points. Except for one-line diagrams, this should show all the circuit nodes. One-line diagrams represent the three or four conductors of three-phase power circuits with one line. # Wiring diagrams are sometimes made. These show and name the termination points and names of each conductor. In some systems enough information can be put onto the schematics so that wiring diagrams are not needed. # Physically smaller systems that are built many times may use a cable harness. A full-sized to-scale wiring diagram can be made of a cable harness. This wiring diagram can then be laid on a peg board and used to guide the construction of more cable harnesses. Harnesses can be inserted into their equipment as an assembly. Cable harnesses that are reused many times, like automobile wiring harnesses, are created with automated machinery. # A wire list is made in spreadsheet or list format. It shows the electrical assembly people what wires are to be connected and to where. When it is printed out on paper, it is easy for the assembly people to check off conductors as they are connected. The wire list contains at a minimum each wire name, terminal name, and wire model number or gage. It may also contain the wire termination device model numbers, voltage classes, conductor class (high-voltage, medium voltage, or control wiring), etc.  References  * Bosela, Ayanda Voyi, Theodore R.(2002).

They are commonly durable buildings built from timber, stone or clay used to safely store valuable commodities. Kura in rural communities are normally of simpler construction and used for storing grain or rice. Those in towns are more elaborate, with a structural timber frame covered in a fireproof, clay outer coating. Early religious kura were built in a \\"log cabin\\" style, whilst those used later to store gunpowder were constructed from stone. Earthen kura, doz≈ç have evolved a particular set of construction techniques in order to make them relatively fireproof. History Kura in Kitakata illustrating protective plasterwork at eaves level The kura storehouse was specifically used to store precious items. Other sorts of storehouses such as outbuildings (naya) and sheds (koya) were used to store more mundane items. The first kura appear during the Yayoi period (300 BC ‚Äì 300 AD) and they evolved into takakura (literally tall storehouse) that were built on columns raised from the ground and reached via a ladder from underneath. They were especially prevalent on the Ryukyu Islands and Amami ≈åshima.Treib (1976), p127 During the Nara period (710‚Äì794), the government taxed the country in rice, and kura were frequently used to store it. After the introduction of Buddhism to Japan, kura were often used to religious items, such as sutra.Ito (1980) p16Gordenker, Alice, \\"Kura\\", Japan Times, 15 May 2012, p. 10 In a domestic situation, traditional Japanese houses had limited storage space. Frequently the sliding fusuma used to divide up rooms were used for the same purpose to create storage space, otherwise there was limited storage under the kitchen and sometimes an attic space was formed in the roof.Treib (1976), p124 Although a few important possessions may have been displayed, available storage was frequently taken up by things like futons that were folded away each morning.All Japan: The Catalogue of Everything Japanese (1984), p32 In addition, many families possessed a wide array of accoutrements required for Japan's cultural festivals and these needed to be stored somewhere safe when not in use.Ito (1980) p26 The traditional houses were built of timber and prone to destruction by fire, so a more durable solution was required to store precious items.All Japan: The Catalogue of Everything Japanese (1984), p32 Earthen kura often became a status symbol, with the greater number of kura indicating the greater wealth of the owner. This led some merchants to build three storey kura.Ito (1980) p36 Due to Kitakata's historic prominence of being the nation's \\"city of kura\\" and storeplace of preservable goods, it has been said by locals that \\"one who doesn't own a kura by the time they are 40 is not yet a man\\". Types =Log cabin kura= Log cabin style kura in Nara have descended in style from the Yayoi period when triangular section logs were used for building.Zwerger (2000) p137 Historic examples have been preserved within the compounds of Buddhist temples and Shint≈ç shrines. The most famous examples are the Sh≈çs≈çin at T≈çdai-ji in Nara, and storehouses at the T≈çsh≈çdai-ji in Nara and the Itsukushima Shrine in Hiroshima. These kura have all been dedicated to storing religious and cultural treasures.Ito (1980) p85 The timbers used in these kura were thicker than other types of wooden storehouses so they were generally more durable, however, they were vulnerable to fire and relied upon separation from adjoining buildings to provide the best fire protection. As such they were unsuitable for urban situations. Roofs were either thatched or covered in cypress bark.Ito (1980) p46 When the Buddhists arrived in Japan they brought the knowledge of using plaster walls with them. However the azekura style continued to be used because it denoted the wealth of the patron. The owner had to firstly have enough possessions to merit building one, the timber used was expensive and they had to own enough land to suitably situate them from other buildings. Eventually this raised log structure gained a religious significance, and the style of domestic kura moved elsewhere.Treib (1976), p127 =Board-wall kura= Boarded wall kura in Shirakawa village, Gifu Board- wall kura were traditionally built in farming communities. Like the azekura above they were vulnerable to fire and were built some distance from other farm buildings. Examples can still be found in the village of Shirakawa in Gifu. They are constructed from a grid of heavy timbers laid to form a foundation, with posts and braces forming bracing for the walls. The interior walls are lined with heavy boards fixed on the inner side. In the case of the kura in Shirakawa, the roofs are thatched in a similar manner to gassh≈ç- zukuri. Traditionally grain was stored on the ground floor with household items stored on the upper floor.Ito (1980) p45 =Stone kura= There are two types of stone kura (). The first has structural stone walls and a roof made up by piling up stone blocks; the second is a wooden structure around which stone is placed for fire protection. The former were primarily built in the Edo period and used for storing firearms and ammunition, such as the one in Osaka Castle which has walls 1.9m thick. Remains of houses on the island of Dejima in Nagasaki that were built by Dutch traders in the Edo Period were built using the latter method, with wooden structure faced with stone.Ito (1980) p62 Kura in the vicinity of the ≈åya quarry near Utsunomiya, Tochigi had roofs made from ≈åya stone. This is an inexpensive tufa that is soft and easily carved but is also waterproof. It was later used by Frank Lloyd Wright on the Imperial Hotel, Tokyo. Nikk≈ç stone obtained from the same quarry as ≈åya stone has a finer grain and was often used for ornamentation on the exterior of kura.Ito (1980) p64 =Earthen kura= Earthen kura are a common sight in Japan,All Japan: The Catalogue of Everything Japanese (1984) p32 and the basic form is normally seen with only minor variations. The basic wood-framed, plaster-walled, tiled-roof design maintains a stable temperature and humidity throughout the year.Treib (1976), p125 Personal belongings kept in this type of kura tended to be kept in beautifully crafted wooden chests called tansu that would be located on a raised floor or balcony within.Treib (1976), p124 Although they became more popular in the Edo period (1603‚Äì1868), references to them are found in the Heian period (794‚Äì1185) where statutes were written to govern the distances between kura in towns in order to prevent the spread of fire.Ito (1980) p69 Construction of the earthen kura Detail of an outer door and namako tiling on a kura in Tsuyama on the Izumo Kaido road Kura in Kitakata illustrating stepped window shutters Photo showing horizontal courses of mizukiri over the windows Most traditional earthen kura have a wooden frame base onto which bamboo lathing and palm fibre was affixed. The internal walls were covered with layers of clay and finished with a plaster top coat.Takeji (2000), illustration 278. The outer walls covered the structural timbers and were more crucial for fireproofing. These were commonly covered first in bamboo lath followed by several applications of clay applied in a complex and laborious process. There were sometimes as many as 24 layers applied. Although the application of the clay helps to make the kura fireproof, it is prone to damage both from physical sources and from rain. Some kura used tiles at the base of the external wall. These were laid either horizontally or diagonally and were fixed with plaster dabs. The joints were thick and protruding, with a rounded top, and because they reminded people of namako (sea cucumber) they became known as namako walls.Ito (1980) p72 Tiles were also sometimes used in horizontal courses set at an angle to the wall (especially over window openings). These were called mizukiri (meaning water cutters) and were used to throw water off the facade to increase the durability of the wall.Treib (1976), p132 The protective fireproofing continues on the top of the kura by forming an inner roof covered in the same way as the walls. The timbers for the outer roof then sit on a fireproof box. The outer roof was used to protect the clay finish from rain. In rural areas this outer roof was often constructed of thatch which would burn off in the event of a fire.Ito (1980) p57 However, due to their relatively short lifespan and complexity in replacing, thatch roofs are becoming a rarity.Zwerger (2000) p218 In towns the roofs were usually tiled. To prevent fire from destroying the roof timbers supporting the outer roof, the eaves were sometimes thickened up with the plaster coating and extended to the underside of the tiles.Ito (1980) p72 Earthen kura usually have double door entrances consisting of a thick plaster outer and thin inner door leaf. The outer perimeter of each door leaf has a series of steps that correspond with similar ones on the frame. These steps are called jabara and they make it more difficult for fire to enter the kura when they are closed. The inner door was often a sliding door made of wood and covered with painted plaster on the outside.Ito (1980) p74 Windows were often situated high up in the kura and were frequently left open to provide ventilation, although there were often iron bar grilles to prevent theft. Windows were often formed in a similar way as doors with a stepped perimeter. When a fire broke out both the doors and the windows were closed and their edges were covered over in plaster.All Japan: The Catalogue of Everything Japanese (1984), p32 In some cases the kura were raised off the ground to prevent vermin and insects from entering. This raised position also helped cool the interior.Treib (1976), p132 Regional variations Kura in Kurashiki showing tiling to the base of the wall laid horizontally in a manner typical to the area. In Takayama, Gifu there are three storey kura for storing floats for the Takayama Festival.Ito (1980) p37 Kura in Kurashiki, Okayama, normally have tiles on the lower part of the external wall laid horizontally rather than diagonally.Ito (1980) p132 See also * Sh≈çs≈çin azekura style storehouse situated adjacent to the T≈çdai-ji temple in Nara * Minka * Machiya * Kitakata, Fukushima (A city in northern Japan with over 2000 kura) Footnotes References  Category:Architecture of Japan ","title":"Kura (storehouse)"},{"id":"27047800","text":"The Molteno Institute for Language and Literacy (MILL), formerly known as the Molteno Project, is a charity organisation that funds literacy programmes and research across Africa, from its headquarters in Johannesburg It was established in 1974, funded by the Molteno Brothers Trust from which it derives its name.

The FDA submitted a warning letter to the company in April 2015, which stated that four of its products did not meet the requirements to be labeled as ‚Äúhealthy.‚Äù The KIND bars specified by the FDA were: Kind Fruit & Nut Almond & Apricot, Kind Fruit & Nut Almond & Coconut, Kind Plus Peanut Butter Dark Chocolate + Protein, and Kind Plus Dark Chocolate Cherry Cashew + Antioxidants. In December 2015, KIND filed a Citizen Petition asking the FDA to update its regulations around the term healthy when used as a nutrient content claim in food labeling. The petition requests a better alignment between food labeling regulations and both the latest nutrition science and federal dietary guidelines. The petition includes support from public health experts, public policy experts and nutritionists. In May 2016, the FDA reversed its position, allowing KIND to use the term 'healthy' on its labels. The FDA told KIND that it could return to the original language of its wrappers which stated that its products are ‚Äúhealthy and tasty, convenient and wholesome, economically sustainable and socially impactful.‚Äù Without any notice, in 2019, Kind began replacing its Plus line of bars containing added antioxidants, such as vitamin C, with ones containing the same ingredients without the antioxidants while using the same product identification numbers. Vitamin C is fragile and often lost in the processing of otherwise healthy ingredients that normally contain it.

The Adjusted Service Rating Score was the system that the United States Army used at the end of World War II in Europe to determine which soldiers were eligible to be repatriated to the United States for discharge from military service as part of Operation Magic Carpet. History As the end of the war in Europe became a reality, the US War Department began planning for the redeployment of Army personnel following the end of hostilities. The Readjustment Regulations were first introduced on September 15, 1944, and revised February 15, 1945, and again on March 5, 1945. The rules were simple in general principle: \\"those who had fought longest and hardest should be returned home for discharge first.\\" The US Army divided units of the European Theater of Operations into four categories: #Units designated as occupation forces (such as the Third and Seventh Army) #Units that had been overseas for less than one year, or those: (a) to be redeployed directly to the Pacific; (b) to be redeployed to the Pacific via the United States; (c) to be returned to the United States to be placed in strategic reserve. #Units to be organized or re-organized in the European Theater for use as occupation forces, or to be redeployed to the Pacific Theater of Operations. #Units to be returned to the United States and inactivated or disbanded. New replacement troops would replace the veterans returning home. Initial criteria An enlisted man needed a score of eighty- five points to be considered for demobilization. The scores were determined as follows: #Month in service = 1 point each #Month in service overseas = 1 point each, in addition to month in service #Combat award (Medal of Honor, Distinguished Service Cross, Distinguished Service Medal, Legion of Merit, Silver Star Medal, Distinguished Flying Cross, Soldier's Medal, Bronze Star Medal, Air Medal, Purple Heart) or campaign participation star = 5 points each #Dependent child under eighteen years old = 12 points each Time of service was calculated from September 16, 1940. The four criteria were the only ones from which points were calculated. No points were issued for age, marriage, or dependent children over the age of eighteen. Battles and awards were also only accepted from a predetermined list. Classes Liberty ships that would be used by the U.S. War Shipping Administration to transfer men and equipment from Europe to the Far East in May 1945. Different scores were set for troops in the US Army, US Army Air Forces, Women‚Äôs Army Corps and holders of the Medal of Honor. =Officers= Before the surrender of Japan, officers who may have had to serve again in combat were assessed not only on their ASR score but also on their efficiency and military specialities. Most high-scoring officers could have expected an early discharge after VE Day. The qualifying score was revised down to eighty points after VJ Day. In the coming months it would be lowered again. =Medical personnel= Scores varied before the end of May 1945 by varied department in the Medical Corps. * Medical Administrative Corps (MAC) = 88 points * Medical Corps (MC) = 85 points (plus specialty) * Nurses Corps = 71 points * Physical Therapists = 65 points * Hygienists and Dietitians = 62 points The discharge program continued until the end of July 1945; the demand to ship personnel and equipment to the Pacific became so great that medical units were prevented from shipping back to the United States for inactivation. However, all transfers to the Pacific were abruptly halted with announcement of the Japanese surrender on August 14, 1945. Post-war changes By September 1945, the War Department redesignated all units in Europe as either Occupation Forces (personnel with either the lowest scores or who were volunteers), Redeployment Forces (those with the highest score being sent back to the United States) or Liquidation Forces (troops with middle scores of 60‚Äì79 points) who were required to close down former front line facilities such as munition dumps or field hospitals. Nevertheless, the ASR began to create problems for the US Army in post-war Germany as high-scoring personnel plus the attrition caused by sickness, compassionate leave and accidents meant continual loss of many experienced officers and NCOs. By December 1, 1945, a new policy was started, which was based on a combination of ASR score and length of service. The points required were as follows: * Officers (excluding Medical Department & WAC) = 70 plus four years of military service * Women's Army Corps officers = 37 points * Medical Department officers = 55 points * All enlisted men = 50 plus four years of military service * All enlisted women = 32 points All enlisted fathers with three or more dependent children under 18 years of age were immediately eligible for discharge irrespective of their time in military service.

Originally a mini-zoo, it was converted into a preserve when it was discovered that the animals refrained from inhabiting the surrounding forest even when set free. The reason for declaring takin as a national animal of Bhutan on 25 November 2005 (Budorcas taxicolor) is attributed to a legend of the animal‚Äôs creation in Bhutan in the 15th century by Lama Drukpa Kunley.Brown, p.87 Legend The local mythology related to declaring takin as the national animal of Bhutan is dated to the 15th century. A Tibetan saint by the name Drukpa Kunley, popularly called by the epithet ‚ÄúThe Divine Madman‚Äù is credited with creating the tamin with unique features. Drukpa Kunley, who was not only a religious preacher but also a proficient tantric, was requested by the people of Bhutan during one of his religious lectures to conjure a miracle before them. The saint agreed to do so provided he was fed for lunch, a whole cow and a whole goat. Once served, he devoured the food of both animals and left out the bones. He then took out the head of the goat and fixed it to the skeleton of the cow and uttered abracadabra and the magic worked. With a snap, he created a live animal, which had the head of the goat and the body of the cow.Brown, p.87 The animal sprang up and moved on to the meadows to graze. The animal was then given the name dong gyem tsey (takin). Since then this animal has been a common sight in the hills of Bhutan. Because of this magical creation with high religious connotation, the animal has been adopted as the national animal of Bhutan.Brown, p.87 Background When a small number of takin were confined in a \\"mini-zoo\\" in Thimphu, the King of Bhutan felt that it was improper for a Buddhist country to confine animals for religious and environmental reasons. He therefore ordered the release of the animals and the closure of the mini-zoo. To everyone‚Äôs surprise, the takin, known for their docile behavior, refused to leave the immediate area, and strayed in the streets of Thimphu in search of food for weeks.Brown, p.106 Given that the animals had become virtually domesticated, it was decided to keep them in an enclosed, forested habitat at the edge of Thimphu and thus the takin preserve came to be established in the Motithang neighborhood. An area of was demarcated and fenced for the preserve. Improvements were implemented in 2004, a collaborative effort of the Royal Government of Bhutan and World Wide Fund, WWF (Bhutan), including a traditionally styled entrance gate, a small information center, signage and trash receptacles. Small openings in the fencing allow photo opportunities (intended) along with unregulated hand- feeding (unintended). As a result, most of the captive animals in the enclosure are obese. The preserve also holds a few sambar and barking deer. The Motithang Takin Reserve has been an integral part of Thimphu city and is an ongoing visitor attraction. NCD plans to expand the collection of the preserve by introducing other rarely seen animals of Bhutan such as the red panda, and the Himalayan serow. Habitat Takin ‚Äì national animal of Bhutan Takin attract attention due to their unusual appearance; taxonomists were originally uncertain of this animal's phylogeny and many people describe it as a ‚Äúbee-stung moose‚Äù. Bhutan takin (Budorcas taxicolor whitei) is listed as a vulnerable species of goat-antelope, native to Bhutan, India and the People's Republic of China. ‚Äì the IUCN database entry includes a brief justification of why this species is vulnerable. Its habitat is alpine meadows during the summer season, above an altitude of , where they feed primarily on grasses. During the summer monsoon season, the lower elevation forests are inhospitable for takin due to the abundance of leeches, mosquitoes, and horseflies. Alpine meadows provide rich grazing for takin and as a result some males have been reported to weigh as much as a tonne. Courtship and mating occur in July and August. After a gestation period of about 8 months, a single calf is born, usually in late February or March. Adult takin have a golden yellow and brownish coat; calves are initially black in colour.Brown, p.87 As the rainy season tapers, the animals move down to elevations of and to browse during the winter season on temperate vegetation of broad leaf forests.Brown, p.87 Threats Takin have little economic value; they provide a traditional medicinal use by women to help them during child birth.Brown, p.87 and are of keen interest to a relatively small but uncertain number of trekkers annually in Bhutan. Genetic health of the animals in the takin preserve is believed to be on the decline due to inbreeding, according to the Nature Conservation Division (NCD) of the Ministry of Agriculture of Bhutan (NCD). The NCD is planning to introduce fresh genes of one male and two female takin from the wild. Wild populations of takin are believed to be stable, though there are no published studies to confirm this, and no one knows how climate change will affect the population of this species in Bhutan. The only known threats they face are from predators and very occasional poaching.

Eleazar; , read as Shimon ben Eleazar) was a Jewish Tanna sage of the fifth generation. Biography He is most likely the son of R. Eleazar ben Shammua.Mordechai Margolias (editor), \\"Encyclopedia LeChachemei Hatalmud VeGeonim\\" (Vol. 1, p. 46-47) He was a pupil of Rabbi Meir, whose teachings, both halakhic and aggadic, he transmitted.Hullin 6a; Shabbat 134a; Eruvin 29a However, Maimonides, when he enumerated the generations of the Tannaim sages, reversed the order of the two, placing R. Simeon ben Eleazar as a contemporary of R. Akiva, whereas placing R. Meir in the following generation. R. Yom Tov Asevilli claims that there were two different Tanna sages with the same name of Simeon ben Eleazar, one in the previous generation to R. Meir, and the other in the following generation to R. Meir, and in that he had resolved the maze of Maimonides' statement.Yom Tov Asevilli (Author), \\"Hidushei ha-Ritva\\" (on Tractate Shabbat, 79a) It is told that once, when returning in a very joyful mood from the academy to his native city, he met an exceedingly ugly man who greeted him. Simeon did not return the greeting, and even mocked the man on account of his ugliness. When, however, the man said to him, \\"Go and tell the Master, who created me, how ugly His handiwork is,\\" Simeon, perceiving that he had sinned, fell on his knees and begged the man's pardon. As the latter would not forgive him, Simeon followed him until they came to Simeon's city, when the inhabitants came out to meet him, greeting him respectfully as rabbi. The man thereupon said to them, \\"If this is a rabbi may there be few like him in Israel,\\" and told them what had occurred; he, however, forgave Simeon when the people begged him to do so. Simeon went the same day to the school and preached a sermon, exhorting all the people to be pliable like a reed and not unbending like a cedar.Ta'anit 20a-b, where the preferable reading has \\"Simon b. Eleazar\\"; see Rabbinowitz, \\"Vari√¶ Lectiones,\\" ad loc.; Avot of Rabbi Natan 41 Teachings He is cited in the Mishnah only a few times, but on the Tosefta and baraitas' portions that are quoted in the Talmud his name is mentioned many times. In many of the classical texts of the baraita, in matters in dispute, he has stated a different version to these disputes cited in the Mishnah. In halakhah, Simeon appears most frequently as the opponent of R. Judah ha-Nasi. Simeon formulated a rule for interpreting Biblical passages in which dots are placed over certain letters or entire words, in conformity with a tradition which was even then sanctioned: If the letters without dots exceed in number those with dots the exposition must be based on the letters without dots; but if the reverse be true, the letters with dots must be interpreted.Genesis Rabbah 48:17; compare Talmudic hermeneutics Like his teacher R. Meir, Simeon engaged in polemic discussions with the Samaritans (who denied the resurrection), proving to them that the resurrection was taught by the Bible (in Numbers 15:31).Sifre Numbers 112 [ed. Friedmann, p. 33b] =Aggadah= Many aggadic teachings by Simeon have been preserved, including the following: * He who is prompted by love to perform ethical and religious acts is greater than he who is prompted to them by fear.\\"Sotah 31a * Three things the left hand should ward off, while the right hand draws them on: desire, a child, and a wife.Sotah 47a * Have you ever seen an animal that is obliged to follow a trade or that must painfully support itself? Yet animals were created for the purpose of serving man, while man was created to serve his Creator. Should not, therefore, man, rather than the animals, be able to support himself without toil? Man, however, has deteriorated in his works, and therefore in his nature, and has been deprived of his nourishment.Mishnah Kiddushin 4:13 * When the old people say, 'Tear down,' and the young people say, 'Build,' listen to the old and not to the young; for the tearing down of the old people is building, and the building of the young people is tearing down, as the story of Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, teaches.Megillah 31b *The verse \\"You shall love your neighbor as thyself: I am the Lord\\"Leviticus 19:18 was uttered with a great oath; meaning \\"I, the Eternal One, have created him. If you love him, I will surely reward you for it; and if you love him not, then I am the judge ready to punish\\".Avot of Rabbi Natan 16 *Do not appease your friend in the hour of his anger... neither come into his house during the hour of his calamity, nor try and see him in the hour of his disgrace. ...Love him that reproves you, but hate him that speaks kindly of you (i.e. flatters you); since he that reproves you brings you into life of the world to come, but he that speaks kindly of you takes you out of this world.

He inspired the fictional character John Brooke in his sister-in-law Louisa May Alcott's best known novels. John Bridge Pratt was born in Boston on June 16, 1833, the second child of Minot Pratt and his wife Maria Jones Bridge Pratt. The Pratt family lived at Brook Farm from 1841 to 1845, after which they moved to Concord, Massachusetts. As a member of the Concord Dramatic Union, John Pratt fell in love with Louisa's elder sister Anna Alcott Pratt, reportedly during a production of \\"The Loan of a Lover\\".Stern, Madeleine, Louisa May Alcott: a Biography, new edition, Northeastern University Press, 1996: 83, 85 The two were married in the Alcott family home, Orchard House, on May 23, 1860.Dapper, Julie, The Alcotts and Orchard House, Louisa May Alcott Memorial Association, 1993: 10-12 They had two sons, Frederick Alcott Pratt (1863-1925) and John Sewall Pratt (1865-1923), who were the models for Demi and Daisy Brooke in the Little Women trilogy.

In fact, Pratt's unexpected death in 1870 had prompted Louisa May Alcott, who was staying in Rome at the time, to write Little Men (published 1871) in order to provide financial security for the widowed Anna and her sons.Stern, Madeleine, Louisa May Alcott: 208 His younger son, John Sewall Pratt, took Alcott as his surname when he was adopted by his Aunt Louisa near the end of her life.

RuBot II was formerly the world's fastest Rubik's Cube-solving robot, and appeared as such in the 2010 Guinness Book of World Records,Guinness Book of World Records 2010, Guinness World Records, 2010, page 154 on the UK edition although its best time has since been well surpassed by a robot called Ruby built at Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, Australia in 2011. Pete Redmond has stated that although the robot was built for entertainment, the science behind it can be practically useful. The technology that helps the RuBot to see can also be used in other robots in places where it might not be safe to send people, like nuclear disaster zones, where a robot can be sent in to see and make independent decisions. There are numerous YouTube videos of Rubot working on Rubik's Cubes, and its makers have given him some 'human' qualities, such as conversation to make these more entertaining. Working The robot can easily pick up and solve the Rubik's Cube puzzle game in an interactive way. In a typical run, the robot is given a Rubik's Cube scrambled by a human. It then grabs the cube and hoists it up to eye camera level, where it scans and records the configurations on all faces of the cube. The input configurations read by RuBot's cameras are run through Kociemba‚Äôs 2 phase algorithm to find a solution with less than 20 moves, the computation normally taking less than one second, (Official site) and then works with it using its pneumatic arms. It can solve any Rubik's Cube in less than 50 seconds, and has managed it in a record time of 21 seconds. The robot has been nicknamed \\"The Cubinator\\". Creator Pete Redmond is from Dublin, Ireland. He has worked as an avionics engineer for the Irish Air Corps. Pete has degrees in Computer Science and a master's degree in Engineering.

It is an independent Lutheran Free Church of Iceland. It lies in the centre of the Icelandic capital, by the lake Tj√∂rnin. The Fr√≠kirkjan √≠ Reykjav√≠k congregation was established in Reykjav√≠k in the autumn of 1899. It had an initial membership of 600 which soon rose. The foundation of the Free Church did not spring from any doctrinal dispute with the national Lutheran church, but arose from objections to certain aspects of the national church's organisations. The Free church followed the example of churches in Norway and those of Icelandic immigrant communities in North America, in wishing to bring the church closer to the people. The rising population of Reykjav√≠k and the concomitant social changes also contributed. Craftsmen and tradesman were growing classes in the town, and new districts were built, and yet Reykjav√≠k Cathedral was still the only church. Shortly after the new congregation was founded, a suitable site for a new church was chosen at the east of the lake. The church was consecrated on 22 February 1903. Only two years later the church was lengthened, to a design by architect R√∂gnvaldur √ìlafsson. In 1924 the church was enlarged again. A chancel was built of concrete at the eastern end, and various alterations were built on either side of the forechurch, supervised by master builder Gu√∞mundur H. √ûorl√°ksson.

(\\"PKXL\\"). PK's first series, titled The Broken Seal, was officially released to the public at the New York's Toy Fair in February 2009. PK Online followed in January 2010.Around town/channel 12/the Mentor Channel PKXL maintains their own print facility along with their development and marketing. PKXL Cards, Inc. was located at 9108 Tyler Boulevard in Mentor, Ohio. They purchased their own printing presses and automated packing machines. Due to low sales of PK Cards, the company shut down in 2011.  Gameplay  Gameplay uses mechanics similar to Hearts, and using Rock Paper Scissors and war variation to break ties. Players will have 7 sorties in which you get to play your hand to attempt to get the most tricks. Each sortie includes a draw step, then an opportunity to play \\"Powers\\" and \\"Influences\\", then ending your turn with the playing of your troop card. The winner is the person with the highest card value. For example, if attacker has a card with 6 attack against a defender's card with 7 Defense. In the event of a tie, one card's element may trump the other. Troop cards have one of 5 elements: Water trumps Fire, Fire trumps Metal, Metal trumps Wood, Wood trumps Earth, and Earth trumps Water. If this does not result in a trump, players \\"PK\\" by playing war with the top card of their decks, determining the winner in the same manner as main gameplay. The winner's troop enters the battle line upright; the loser's troop enters the battle line inverted. The winner leads the next sortie; lead person in each sortie is always the attacker. The person with the most upright cards in his/her battle line after the 7th sortie wins a Prestige point. After the 7th sortie, the battle lines are wiped and gameplay continues. The first to get 7 Prestige points wins.  The Cards  The PK Cards first set is made up of 366 collectible playing cards. The first release contained booster packs and 4 Core Decks: Red, Yellow, Blue, and Grey. The set included 7 card types used to play: Avatar, Power, Influence, Henchman, Ally, Champion, and Legend. Each of these cards came with four levels of rarity: Common, Uncommon, Rare, and Exotic. *Avatar: the leader of your army. With his/her abilities this card works with other cards in the set to boost troop‚Äôs abilities. *Power: This card represents an ancient relic or magical item to alter game play by way of improving troops or even changing some of the standard rules of play. *Influences: This is a onetime use card it is in play only for one sortie, it is a magical card that helps your troops or hurts your opponents. *Troops: 4 ranks of troop cards split into 5 element groups, Fire, Water, Earth, Metal, and Wood. These cards represent the warriors that are being sent into battle. These cards have abilities that come into effect when the card comes into play. Even though you can play any troop at any time, you have to keep your troops in rank in order to keep from receiving the penalties. *Henchman: The lowest ranking of the troop cards, this card can be played without an out of rank penalty. *Ally: Rank 2 of troop cards can be played at any time, but without a Henchman in the field (face up) played in a sortie before the Ally card will receive a minus 2 to both attack and defense. *Champion: The 3rd rank of troop cards can be played at any time, but without a Henchman and an Ally (face up) played in sorties before the champion card will receive a minus 4 to both attack and defense. *Legend: The highest ranking troop cards can be played at any time, but without Henchman, Ally, and Champion (face up) played in sorties before the Legend card will receive a minus 6 to both attack and defense.

Listed at , 120 lb., Briggs batted left-handed and threw right-handed. She was born in Ayer, Massachusetts.The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League: A Biographical Dictionary ‚Äì W. C. Madden. Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2005. Format: Paperback, 295 pp. Language: English. Brief profile An All-Star and member of two champion teams, Briggs was a solid backup catcher during the last years of existence of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Known more for her glove work than her bat, she had a strong throwing arm and worked well with pitchers, important in a league that progressively expanded the length of the base paths and pitching distance and decreased the size of the ball until the final year of play. A consistent and durable player, she recorded an all-time mark for most games played by a catcher in a single season. Besides this, she provided versatility being able to play all outfield positions and first base while being a left-hitter. Early life Briggs started to play baseball at a very early age. She attended Ayer High School, where she was the full-time catcher for the Ayer baseball team to become the first and only girl ballplayer in the school's history. Briggs was discovered by an AAGPBL scout while she was playing at school and give her a tryout. Briggs did well, and was given a contract to play in the 1947 season. This time the league opened its spring training in Havana, Cuba. In the last week of April, the circuit flew two hundred girls to Havana. They spent a week and a half training and drilling before they were allocated to the eight clubs that played in 1946. For girls like Briggs who began after the 1947 season, competing in the AAGPBL meant playing a tough brand of baseball, a game that grew increasingly closer to major league baseball.The Telegraph - May 1, 1947.

Retrieved 2019-03-27.SABR Project ‚Äì Betsy Jochum biography by Jim Sargent AAGPBL career Briggs entered the league in 1947 with the Rockford Peaches, playing for them one and a half years before joining the Chicago Colleens (1948), South Bend Blue Sox (1949), Racine Belles (1949), Peoria Redwings (1949-'51), Battle Creek Belles (1952) and Fort Wayne Daisies (1953-'54). She hit .215 in limited action during her rookie season. In 1948 she batted .200 for Rockford and Chicago with a career-high 43 stolen bases and seven triples (third in the league). She caught 128 games that year, to set an all-time record for most games played by a catcher in a single season.Encyclopedia of Baseball Catchers ‚Äì AAGPBL records Playing for three clubs in 1949, Briggs hit a combined .222 average with 22 steals before becoming a regular with Peoria for the next two years. Her most productive season came in 1951, when she posted career-highs in average (.275), runs scored (57) and runs batted in (44). After that she helped the Daisies to win pennants in 1953 and 1954, but the team lost the final series in both years to the Grand Rapids Chicks and Kalamazoo Lassies, respectively. She was named to the All-Star Team in 1952, and shared catching duties with Pepper Paire in 1954, during what turned out to be the All- American League's final season. In November 1988, the AAGPBL received their long overdue recognition when the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York dedicated a permanent display to the entire league rather than any individual player.

He also represented Scotland and Britain in disability table tennis and basketball for 12 years, including winning a World Championship silver medal in singles table tennis. Killin made his first Paralympic appearance as a wheelchair fencer at the 1980 Summer Games where he won two silver medals, and also competed in the 1984 Summer Paralympics. He first joined the Braehead Curling Club in 2003. In 2005 he represented Scotland at the World Championships in a team that also contained Frank Duffy, Ken Dickson, Angie Malone and Michael McCreadie. They won the gold medal and all five athletes were selected to compete for Britain in the first Paralympic wheelchair curling event held at the 2006 Winter Paralympics in Turin, Italy. During the Paralympic tournament Britain won their group games against the teams from Denmark, Sweden, Italy and the United States, and lost the matches against Switzerland, Norway and Canada.

In 2010 Killin was again part of Great Britain's Paralympic wheelchair curling team. The team, which also featured Michael McCreadie as skip, Angela Malone, Aileen Neilson and James Sellar, had finished fifth at the 2009 World Championships. Britain won three of their nine group games, beating teams from Switzerland, Germany, and Japan. They finished in sixth position, which meant that they did not advance to the medal matches.

The Seicento saw the end of the Renaissance movement in Italy and the beginning of the Counter-Reformation and the Baroque era. The word means \\"six hundred\\" (sei = six, cento = hundred) and is short for , 1600. Definition The Seicento in Italy simply refers to the 17th century, yet abroad, the word refers to the Italian cultural and social history during this period, characterised by several wars and conflicts, invasions, and the patronage of the arts and architecture. It was also the period in which the Baroque era came into place (the Baroque being an essentially Italian movement, having been created by the popes in Rome as a part of the Catholic Reformation). This period also saw advancements in Italian science, philosophy and technology. History The 1647 revolt against high taxation in Naples, led and triggered by rebel Masaniello. :For additional information, see: History of Italy during the Early Modern age The 17th century was a tumultuous period in Italian history, with several political and social changes, and times of much civil and military unrest. This included the increase in number of Spanish colonies and possessions along the peninsula, and the increase in power of the pope and the Roman Catholic Church during the Counter Reformation, a counterpart of the Protestant Reformation. Despite several artistic and scientific contributions, such as the invention of several musical instruments, stylistic genres, astronomical discoveries and the creation of the Baroque, Italy, which was the cultural leader of Europe in the 16th century, experienced a social decline, which slowly began in the beginning of the 17th century and fell towards the end of the century. This was due to persistent conflicts, revolts (such as the Neapolitan 1647 tax- related Revolt of Masaniello), invasions and the rise in popularity of French, English and Spanish culture. Events which happened during this period include the 1633 papal trial of scientist Galileo Galilei, the 1647 revolt in Naples, the 1669 Etna eruption, the 1674 rebellion in Messina and the 1693 Sicily earthquake. Different criteria =Art= Italian art during the 17th century was predominantly Baroque in essence. 17th-century Italian Baroque art was similar in style and subject matter to that during the same period in Spain - characterised by rich, dark colours, and often religious themes relating notably to martyrdom, and also the presence of several still lifes. Lombard painter Caravaggio stands out as one of the most prominent from this era, known for his sacred (\\"Supper at Emmaus\\"), mythological (\\"Medusa\\"), still-life (\\"Basket of Fruit\\") genres and the common depiction of local people (\\"Boy carrying a Basket of Fruit). His paintings were predominantly oil, and used warm, intense colours, and usually having dramatic themes. Having one of the forefathers of Baroque art, and one of the earliest modern painters, his styles influenced other Italian and foreign artists following him, including Gian Lorenzo Bernini. Gian Lorenzo Bernini was a prominent mid to late-17th century Baroque artist and sculptor, known for his statues, such as the \\"Ecstasy of Saint Theresa\\".

One can notice the warm colours (red, pink, peach, light-brown) used in this painting. Such styles were popular in 17th-century Italian art. File:BerniniAngel03.jpgBaroque art and architecture was popular in 17th-century Italy. =Architecture= Building styles for Italian 17th- century architecture, most notably the Baroque, were very different all across the country. Turin was well known for its French-style Baroque architecture. This began in the city during the late-17th century (1680s onwards). Before, buildings were still constructed in dark and austere brick Renaissance style, yet by the late 17th century, this style evolved into a more Baroque one, similar to that used in Paris and Versailles, characterised by gold/copper gilded roofs, Italian/French gardens, French windows and ornate decoration. Genoa still kept constructing painted houses, yet, the painted designs were more ornate and in touch with the popular Baroque designs. Milan was similar to Turin in architectural patterns and trends, yet was less influenced by French designs, and more by the Spanish ones (considering Milan was ruled by Spain). Venice started to construct more ornate Baroque buildings ever since in 1650s. In Rome and Southern Italy, this was slightly different. Buildings in Rome were constructed in a Baroque style ever since the early-17th century, and examples of this could be St Peter's Basilica and the Palazzo Bernini. The Catholic Reformation's aim was to make Roman Catholicism look like an appealing denomination, and the popes did this by not only reforming the church's organization and society, yet also constructing ornate basilicas, fountains, piazzas (Italian squares), palaces and monuments. The architecture of Rome at the time was characterised by grandiose palaces, rich interiors, frescos and elegant cartouches. This style reached the South slightly later, towards the 1650s, and, especially in Naples and Sicily, was known for its similarity to Spanish architecture, visible in buildings such as the Certosa of San Martino in Naples.

File:Villa torrigiani di lucca 05.JPGThe Villa Torrigiani, found in Lucca, a country house which was founded in the late-16th century, yet whose exterior and garden date to the mid-17th century. =Education= A painting of Elena Cornaro Piscopia, the first female laureate and woman to receive a PhD in the world There were several advancements made in 17th- century Italian education systems. One example could be the admission of Elena Cornaro Piscopia into the University of Padua. A mathematician, scholar and academic, Piscopia was the first woman in the world to ever graduate with a doctorate (PhD, or doctor of philosophy) in 1678. Several universities, colleges and institutions were founded in this century, such as the University of Cagliari in 1620. =Fashion= In the 17th century, Italy saw a decline in importance as the fashion trendsetter of Europe, which it was in the 15th and 16th centuries. Despite still holding this position until the 1620s and 30s, by the 1640s, when Louis XIV gained power in France, and the popularity of dresses in Spain, the French and Spanish court tastes became more popular than the Italian ones, and Italy would only return to its original influential position in the 1950s. In the early 17th century, fashions for men and women were relatively similar to those of the 1580s and 90s. Women used to still wear elaborate ruffs and large, elaborate dresses (the decoration depended on the wealth and social class of the women wearing it). By the 1630s, ruffs began to fall out of fashion, and these were replaced by pearl necklaces. Hair was often done up much more elaborately than before, with curls and flowers and jewels inside. The wearing of a chemise, and collar heightened in Italian female fashion in the 1650s and 60s. By the 1670s, dresses became simpler and less large than in the early 17th century, yet hair was often done up much more elaborately than before, and women began to wear mantuas and gowns. By the 1680s and 90s, women tended to wear simple or averagely decorated dresses, with a mantua, elaborate hair (often a wig), long-sleeved gloves, and often carried around a fan. File:Frans Luycx 007.jpgItalian female fashions in the early-17th century File:Anna maria luisa de medici hunting dress.jpgItalian female fashions in the late-17th century In the early 17th century, male fashion too was similar to that of the late-16th century. They used to wear cuffs, short-sleeved trousers and had long hair. Most men also grew moustaches, and used to wear boots, and by the 1630s, feathered hats became popular. By the late-17th century, male fashion concentrated on highly elaborate dresses and shoes, grey curled wigs, and richly decorated petticoats and overskirts. Galileo Galilei, a renowned Italian scientist and astronomer by Justus Sustermans, 1636. =Science and technology= There were several contributions to science and technology in Italy during the 17th century, which saw the development of tools, physics, astronomy and heliocentricism. Galileo Galilei's discovering of Saturn's rings, the Venus' phases, and several new technological inventions, such as his 1609 telescope and compass made for military reasons in 1604. All of this has made him renowned as one of the fathers of modern science, astronomy and technology. He also supported heliocentricism, a controversial issue, since it was viewed at the time that the planets and the sun rotated around the earth, not the other way round has he argued. =Literature and philosophy= The seicento too saw several renowned literary figures. Giambattista Vico was one of the most famous. He was a Neapolitan writer and philosopher, and was known for his several books, usually regarding history, reasoning, philosophy and law. Such books include \\"La Scienza Nuova\\". =Music= Stradivari's classical violin Italy's musical contributions in the 17th century were amongst its greatest, including the invention of the piano in 1700, creation of new forms of the violin, and great contributions to opera, invented in Italy (Florence) in the 16th century, and the beginning of Baroque music in the country. During the 17th century, both opera and Baroque musical styles were developed. Church music was popular in this time, especially sponsored by the religiously-run musical academies and conservatories in Naples, the main centre of musical education along the peninsula. Opera composers at the time include Claudio Monteverdi. In the late-17th century, Cremona-based luthier Antonio Stradivari developed the classical violin, then called the Stradivarius after his name, and in 1700, Bartolomeo Cristofori invented the piano in Florence, Tuscany.

In May 1624, Dutch WIC forces under Jacob Willekens captured Salvador Bahia from the Portuguese. Philip IV, king of Spain and Portugal, ordered the assembly of a Spanish-Portuguese fleet with the objective of recovering the city. Sailing from the port of Lisbon, under the command of Fadrique √Ålvarez de Toledo y Mendoza, who was appointed Captain General of the Army of Brazil, the fleet crossed the Atlantic Ocean, and arrived at Salvador on April 1 of 1625. The town was besieged for several weeks, after which it was recaptured. This resulted in the expulsion of the Dutch from the city and the nearby areas. The city was a strategically important Portuguese base in the struggle against the Dutch for the control of Brazil.  Background  On December 22, 1623, a Dutch fleet under the command of Admiral Jacob Willekens and Vice Admiral Pieter Heyn consisting of 35 ships,Duro p.57 of which 13 were owned by the United Provinces, while the rest belonged to the WIC, sailed from Texel carrying 6,500 men en route to Cape Verde,P√©rez p.233 where they arrived after being scattered by a storm. There Willekens was revealed that his objective was the capture of the city of Salvador da Bahia, on the coast of Brazil, in order to use its port as a commercial base to ensure the Dutch trade with the East Indies.Marley p.108 In addition they would control much of the sugar production in the region, as Salvador was a major center of its production in the area.Fern√°ndez p.512 These intentions to invade Brazil were soon reported to the court of Madrid by the Spanish spies in the Netherlands, but Count-Duke of Olivares did not give them credit.Southey p.148  Campaign  = Dutch capture = A Dutch Squadron attacking a Portuguese Fortress in the Far East or Brazil. Oil on panel by Adam Willaerts. On May 8 the Dutch fleet appeared off Salvador. The Portuguese governor of Salvador, Diogo de Mendon√ßa Furtado, tried to organized the defense of the town with 3,000 men hastily recruited,Duro p.47 mostly Portuguese militia of peasant levees and black slaves, all of them resentful to Spanish rule.Marley p.108 The port was protected by sea by two forts: Fort Santo Ant√≥nio from the east and Fort S√£o Filipe from the west. Additionally a six-gun battery was erected on the beach and the streets were barricaded. The Dutch fleet entered the bay divided into two squadrons. One sailed towards the beach of Santo Ant√≥nio and disembarked the soldiers commanded by Colonel Johan van Dorth. The other anchored off the town and opened fire over the coastal defenses, which were quickly neutralized. At dawn the city was surrounded by more than 1,000 Dutch soldiers with 2 pieces of artillery.Marley p.108 Intimidated, the Portuguese militia threw their weapons and fled, leaving Mendon√ßa with 60 loyal soldiers.Marley p.108 Salvador had been captured at a cost of 50 casualties among the attackers.Marley p.108 Willekens and Heyn installed a garrison under the command of Dorth before departing on new missions, according to the orders they had received. Four ships were sent to Holland carrying booty and news back,Marley p.108 and also instructions to call for reinforcements to secure Salvador.Duro p.48 The defenses of the city were reinforced and expanded with moats and ramparts and the garrison was soon increased to up 2,500 men with numerous Portuguese slaves seduced by promises of freedom and land.Marley p.108 However, the Dutch garrison soon began to be harassed by the local guerrilla organized by Bishop Dom Marcos Teixeira, who had escaped inland. He managed to assemble a force of 1,400 Portuguese and 250 Indians auxiliaries,Calvo p.45Solano p.245 who built fortifications and organized ambushes against the Dutch acting under woodland. In an attempt to drive off the attackers from the outskirts, Dorth himself was killed, and morale sagged. He was replaced by Albert Schoutens, who also perished in another ambush, being replaced by his brother Willem. = Iberian Expedition = Engraving by Benedictus Mealius Lusitanus, in Jornada dos Vassalos da Coroa de Portugal, Lisbon, 1625. When news of the loss of Salvador arrived to Spain in August 1624, Philip IV ordered to assemble a joint Spanish-Portuguese fleet under Admiral Fadrique √Ålvarez de Toledo y Mendoza with the mission to retake the city. On November 22, the Portuguese fleet under Manuel de Menezes, with Francisco de Almeida as second in command, left Lisbon. It was composed by 22 ships and about 4,000 men.Duro p.49 The Spanish fleet left the port of Cadiz on January 14 after the delay caused by bad weather. It was composed by 38 ships belonging to the armadas of Castile, Biscay, Gibraltar and Cuatro Villas,Duro p.49 among them 21 galleons. It had 8,000 sailors and soldiers on board, being those latter divided in three Tercios, of whom one was Italian and the other two Spanish. Its commanding officers were the maestros de campo Pedro Osorio, Juan de Orellana and Carlos Carraciolo, Marquis of Torrecuso. The commander-in-chief of the joint army was Pedro Rodr√≠guez de Sebasti√°n, seconded by Sargento Mayor Diego Ruiz.C√©spedes p.508 After passing through the Canary Islands on January 28, the Spanish fleet arrived at Cape Verde on February 6, where it joined the Portuguese fleet. This one had lost a ship and 140 men drowned in the shoals of the Isle of Maio.Duro p.50 Five days later, after holding a council of war, the joint fleet sailed to Brazil. After waiting for some Portuguese ships delayed by rough seas and 7 caravels under the command of Francisco de Moura sent from Pernambuco, the fleet entered the Bay of Todos os Santos on March 29. =Siege= Detail of a map showing the joint Spanish-Portuguese fleet recapturing Salvador, Bahia in 1625, Atlas of Brazil by Jo√£o Teixeira Albernaz I (1631) Toledo anchored his fleet forming a huge crescent to prevent the escape of the Dutch ships in the bay. At dawn of the following day 4,000 soldiers landed at Santo Ant√≥nio beach with food and supplies for four days.Duro p.52 They joined up with the Portuguese guerrilla and occupied the field above Salvador. The Dutch were forced back within their walls, warping their 18 ships beneath the protection of their batteries. Their strength at that time amounted to 2,000 Dutch, English, French and German soldiers and about 800 black auxiliaries.Aveda√±o p.2 The quarters of Carmen and San Benito, located both outside the walls, were occupied by the Tercios, and a new one, named Las Palmas, was built. Siege warfare ensued, with the artillery firing over the Dutch fortifications from these positions and the pioneers driving saplines toward the Dutch ramparts. The defenders launched several sporadic attacks to obstruct the siege works. During one of these sallies, maestro de campo Pedro Osorio and 71 Spanish officers and soldiers were killed and another 64 wounded.Marley p.110 Nevertheless, the siege continued. Two days later, the Dutch attempted to break the blockade sending two fire ships against the anchored Spanish-Portuguese fleet, but they didn't cause any damage.Marley p.110 Some mutinies emerged among the defenders following this failure, and Willem Schoutens was deposed and replaced by Hans Kyff. He was forced to capitulate few weeks later, when the siege lines finally reached Salvador's moats. 1,912 Dutch, English, French and German soldiers surrendered, and 18 flags, 260 guns, 6 ships, 500 black slaves and considerable amount of gunpowder, money and merchandise were captured.Marley p.110  Aftermath  Several days after the Dutch surrender, a relief fleet of 33 ships under Admiral Boudewijn Hendricksz, seconded by Vice Admiral Andries Veron, bore down upon the bay divided in two columns.Marley p.110 Toledo, who was warned about its arrival, disposed 6 galleons to lure them to a murderous crossfire. However, seeing the large Spanish-Portuguese fleet anchored inside, Hendricksz decided to withdraw to open sea. Spanish warships attempted to pursue him but a galleon ran aground and the chase was abandoned.Marley p.110 Hendricksz divided his fleet in three groups. One of them returned to Holland with the supplies and ammunition for the garrison of Salvador; the other two attacked respectively the Spanish Caribbean colonial town of San Juan de Puerto Rico and the Portuguese African trading post of the Castle of Elmina but were both decisively defeated. Francisco de Moura Rollim, appointed governor of Salvador by Fadrique de Toledo, remained in the town with a garrison of 1,000 Portuguese soldiers. During the journey back to Spain, 3 Spanish ships and 9 Portuguese ships sank in storms.Southey p.148 Maestro de Campo Juan de Orellana was among the drowned men. The Dutch prisoners were returned to the Low Countries aboard five German store ships, being the officers judged on their arrival by the loss of the city.Southey p.148 The Dutch did not return to Brazil until 1630, when they conquered Pernambuco from the Portuguese.

It belongs to the DOCa Rioja Rioja (wine). ¬´Compa√±√≠a Vin√≠cola del Norte de Espa√±a, commonly known as Cune, was established in 1879 and comprises The Imperial, Vi√±a Real and Contino labels, among others.¬ª Since 1879, CVNE has at all times belonged to the direct descendants of the Real de Asua family. CVNE has always focused in vinegrowing and winemaking in Rioja. Its first exports started in 1880 to Europe and America. CVNE is quoted in the Spanish Stock Market.  History Among the more prominent milestones in the history of CVNE, wine pasteurization using a ‚ÄúMalvoisin‚Äù pasteurizer, a revolutionary device, placed CVNE at the pinnacle of innovation among world winemakers.¬´Como he dicho, al mismo tiempo que se realizaban ampliaciones, la empresa tambi√©n se modernizaba. Esto ocurri√≥ en √©pocas muy tempranas, como prueba la maquinaria instalada hoy en el jard√≠n de la bodega. Se trata de un pasteurizador Malvoisin que a finales de siglo se import√≥ con gran esfuerzo de Francia y que sirv√≠o durante a√±os para tratar los vinos u esterilizar las botellas. Hace tiempo que ya el aparato es√° fuera de uso, y en Cune ya no se pasteuriza los vinos.¬ª ‚ÄúEl Carmen‚Äù, the largest all-concrete winemaking facility of its day in Spain, was set up in 1940 in a clear move towards the benefits of concrete winemaking. ¬´Hubo bodegas ‚Äì tal la ‚ÄúCompa√±√≠a Vin√≠cola del norte de Espa√±a‚Äù ‚Äì que en los momentos dudosos se dio, con decisi√≥n y clara perspectiva del futuro, a la tarea de ampliar sus instalaciones. Ocurri√≥ exactamente a partir de diciembre de 1939, una vez que se hizo cargo de la Presidencia del Consejo de Administraci√≥n de ‚Äú Cvne‚Äù aquel gran se√±or y experto financiero que se llamo Pedro. J. De Gal√≠ndez y Vallejo. Corto de palabra y lardo en obras, Gal√≠ndez se dedico a la tarea de remozar y poner al d√≠a instalaciones y calados. En 1941 ‚Äú Cvne‚Äù construye un nuevo pabell√≥n que recibe el nombre de bodega del Carmen. Son 72 tinos y 9 cisternas que suman una capacidad de almacenamiento de 20.000 hectolitros.¬ª Later on, in 1989, ‚ÄúEl Pilar‚Äù, a gravity-driven winemaking facility to handle CVNE‚Äôs grapes was first put to operational use. As old as winemaking, the gravity principle applied to winemaking gets rid of all hydraulic pumps and hoses, and is followed only by a handful of winemakers worldwide. In 2005, CVNE refurbished the old winery buildings dating back to the 19th century, and created an educational area called ‚ÄúLa Aldea del Vino‚Äù (The Wine Village), in which one of the very few remaining examples of Gustav Eiffel‚Äôs engineering techniques to avoid using pillars in wide buildings can be seen. The latest in terms of vinegrowing and winemaking is, however, the implementation of a research project to reduce the yield per vine, as a means to improve the quality of wine, through increasing the population of vines per surface unit. .  Wines ‚Ä¢ CUNE: The original name for this wine was supposed to have been CVNE, like the company, but an early misspelling decided this wine‚Äôs name for good. It was the first wine produced by CVNE in its winery in Haro. ‚Ä¢ Imperial: This wine was first made in the 1920s and only made on vintages of exceptional quality. Depending on it, certain vintages undergo cask and bottle ageing to achieve ‚ÄòReserva‚Äô category, while others which are thought to be more suitable for an even longer maturation process are eventually released as ‚ÄòGran Reserva‚Äô. All grapes are sourced from CVNE‚Äôs own vineyards at Villalba. ‚Ä¢ Monopole: First produced in 1915, it is currently the oldest existing fresh white wine in Rioja, and possibly in the whole of Spain. ‚Ä¢ Corona: Another rarity that goes back to the dawn of Rioja as a winemaking region, this semi sweet white is the only existing example in Rioja of a partial noble rot wine, in a country where Botrytis cinerea only occurs very seldom. This wine is typically made in minimal amounts, fermented in American oak barrels and obviously made only in those unusual years of high humidity conditions. ‚Ä¢ Real de As√∫a: A fairly recent addition to the CVNE range, the first vintage of which was 1994. Named after CVNE‚Äôs two founders, this wine is made from the same grapes as Imperial but the winemaking and cask ageing processes follow a completely different route, ending up in an entirely different wine. ‚Ä¢ Vi√±a Real: The Vi√±a Real wines were first launched in 1920, made from grapes from the Rioja Alavesa area. Since then, these wine have typically been named as ‚ÄòPlata‚Äô (Crianza), ‚ÄòOro‚Äô (Reserva), and Gran Reserva. A Viura-based Barrel Fermented white is also made. ‚Ä¢ Pagos de Vi√±a Real: The first vintage was 2001, at the same time as the start of the building work for Vi√±a Real‚Äôs new winery. This wine is made from a selection of Tempranillo grapes hand-picked at Vi√±a Real‚Äôs oldest vineyards in Rioja Alavesa. A further selection is carried out later on at the winery followed by winemaking in small wide oak vats and both malolactic fermentation and ageing in oak casks. ‚Ä¢ Contino: This wines are made exclusively from the stocks planted on its 62 hectares located in Laserna, near the town of Laguardia in the Rioja Alavesa wine making region.  Wineries =CVNE= CVNE is the winery where the company began in 1879. And today it still sits on its original site, in the wine district, Barrio de la Estaci√≥n, in Haro, Rioja Alta. The Haro winery comprises a collection of structures and cellars, most dating from the 19th century, arranged around a central patio. Above the cellars are the winemaking, bottling, and shipping facilities, conserved to this day. With the time, a serial number of structures have been built, which reflect the vinicole history of the winery. The Eiffel ‚Äòs Cellar, designed by the architecture practice of the legendary Alexandre ‚Äì Gustave Eiffel; The Real de As√∫a cellar, a winery inside another winery. The Real de Asua cellar is an independent winery inside the original historic quarters of Cune. This cellar allows for a fully traditional winemaking process subject to the strictest quality controls. The greater wines of the Compa√±√≠a Vin√≠cola del Norte de Espa√±a, namely, Real de As√∫a and Imperial, are made in this cellar. = Vi√±a Real = 350px The Vi√±a Real winery is located 10 minutes away from Logro√±o. It was designed by Philippe Mazieres.. His Majesty the King of Spain Juan Carlos I inaugurated the Vi√±a Real winery in 2004, and was the first winery in Spain to be adapted for the physically handicapped and blind. = Vi√±edos del Contino = 350px Vi√±edos del Contino was set up jointly by CVNE and the Contino estate owners in 1973, establishing the first properly speaking ‚Äúch√¢teau‚Äù in Rioja. Contino is a 62 hectare estate along a meander on the northern bank of the river Ebro, near the village of Laserna (Rioja Alavesa).

Most of these species are large tropical evergreen perennials, mainly from lowland areas with high temperature and humidity. Musa ornata originated in southeast Asia,Tropilab Inc. - Musa ornata and is cultivated for its commercial and ornamental value.Killer Plants - Plant of the Week 25 August 2003: Musa ornata. The fruit is attractive but tends to be inedible.Ornamental Bananas - Not Edible But Beautiful Description Musa ornata belongs to the Musa section Rhodochlamys. Rhodochlamys is one of the four sections into which the genus Musa is divided (the others being Australimusa, Callimusa and Eumusa, which is sometimes called Musa). As a member of Rhodochlamys, M. ornata has a basic chromosome number of 2n = 22 compared with 2n = 20 of the Australimusa and Callimusa. Plants of this section are known for their brightly colored bracts.Diversity in the genus Musa - Focus on Rhodochlamys The true M. ornata is found in India and is a small species. From its home in India it reached Central and South America early in the 19th century where it became naturalized. M. ornata is not an especially variable plant in itself but it hybridizes freely with other species. The result is that there are a number of hybrids derived from it in the tropical regions of America.ENCANTO FARMS - Ornata Plants grow to a height of . The plants have green foliage with pink tones throughout. The leaves can grow to be long, wide and can be used for tropical cut flower arrangements. It produces pink flowers and small, dark pink or crimson fruit.

The anthers of the male flowers are purple while the female style is green. Distribution Musa ornata is native to south-east Asia and commonly found in Bangladesh, Burma, and India. This species is widely distributed throughout tropical regions but it is often misnamed. The plant is relatively tolerant and was found in Mauritius (off the coast of Madagascar) before 1805 and must have begun to travel several years before it was botanically described in 1824 on Indian banana plantations. Numerous parts of Mexico have also naturalized the plant, although the seedlings are often offered commercially under a different name (Musa violacea). .Musa ornata Fruit Cultivation Musa ornata is one of several banana species grown as ornamental plants for their handsome foliage, for instance in mixed tropical plantings. In temperate zones it must be protected from winter frosts, or grown under glass with heat - minimum temperature . It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. It flowers readily and produces few but viable seeds. Other uses The male bud may be cooked or used in salads, while the leaves are often incorporated in making dressings. The root of the plant is also sometimes used for ayurvedic preparations (alternative medicine) in northeast India. The ash of the pseudostem, the corm, the fruiting stalk and fruit peel are also used as an anti-scorbutic (to prevent scurvy), as well as for digestive help, or as a tonic.Bananas and People in the Homeland of Genus Musa:Not just pretty fruit- Jean Kennedy, published July 30, 2009.

It had two unusual design features. First; it had two Kawasaki Ha-40 engines in tandem; one in the aircraft nose, the other behind the cockpit, both being connected by a drive shaft. This combination (called the Kawasaki Ha-201) drove two, three-bladed, contra- rotating propellors. The second feature was the use of the wing surface as a radiator for the water-cooled engines. The aircraft first flew in December 1943. During the fifth flight, the rear engine caught fire; and while the aircraft made an emergency landing, it was damaged. The aircraft was subsequently abandoned in mid-1944 in favour of more promising projects. The airframe survived the war, and parts of the unique cooling system were sent to Wright Field for examination.

Gramsci coined the term to refer to a significant change that is not an abrupt one, but a slow and gradual metamorphosis which could take years or generations to accomplish.Gramsci, Antonio; Forgacs, David (1988). An Antonio Gramsci Reader: Selected Writings, 1916-1935. New York: Schocken. Gramsci uses \\"passive revolution\\" in a variety of contexts with slightly different meanings. The primary usage is to contrast the passive transformation of bourgeois society in 19th-century Italy with the active revolutionary process of the bourgeoisie in France. However, Gramsci also associates Italian fascism with the notion of passive revolution. Passive revolution is a transformation of the political and institutional structures without strong social processes. Gramsci also uses the term for the mutations of the structures of capitalist economic production that he recognizes primarily in the development of the United States factory system of the 1920s and 1930s. Besides this usage of the term, \\"passive revolution\\" as a descriptive tool of historical analysis, Gramsci seems to employ it like a suggestion as path for struggle. In a society subsumed within capital, the only way Gramsci can see to make a revolution is a relatively \\"passive\\" one through the institutions of civil society.Negri, Antonio; Hardt, Michael (2011).

Although most of its members came from the conservative National Alliance (AN) and were earlier members of the Italian Social Movement (MSI), GI was a social liberal wing within the PdL. The faction's members identified themselves as close supporters of Gianfranco Fini, former leader of MSI/AN and frequent critic of Silvio Berlusconi from his post of President of the Chamber of Deputies. During the years, the former post-fascist leader had taken controversial stances on stem cell research, end of life issues, advance health care directive and immigration. Fini was also an outspoken supporter of the principle of separation of church and state and of a more structured party organisation. Although most Finiani, such as Bocchino, Adolfo Urso, Fabio Granata, Carmelo Briguglio, Flavia Perina and Giulia Bongiorno, were perfectly in line with Fini on moral issues and immigration, many others, including Andrea Ronchi, took a very different approach on these issues. In fact most Finiani were southern conservatives who opposed Berlusconi's leadership, his firm alliance with the once-separatist Lega Nord, the party's economic policy and federal reform. History Generation Italy was launched in December 2009 by Italo Bocchino, deputy- leader of the PdL in the Chamber of Deputies, in order to better represent Fini's views within the party and push for a different party organisation, which was thought to be too dependent on Berlusconi's personality. Bocchino explained that it was not his intent or Fini's to undermine the party, while he wanted to promote internal democracy through debate and strengthen the party, especially in the North, where it had suffered a big blow from Lega Nord in 2010 regional elections. Despite this, however, the faction soon caused a major upheaval within the party. On 15 April Fini posed a sort of ultimatum to Berlusconi and hinted the formation of separate parliamentary groups from the PdL in Parliament. Some Finiani even proposed the formation of a new party outside the PdL. After some tense days, it looked likely that Fini and his group would remain in the party as a minority faction. On 20 April 52 MPs (39 deputies and 13 senators) signed a document in support of Fini and his theses, while other 74 ex-AN MPs, including Ignazio La Russa, Maurizio Gasparri, Altero Matteoli and Giorgia Meloni, plus the Mayor of Rome Gianni Alemanno, signed an alternative document in which they reasserted their loyalty to the party and Berlusconi. It was the end of the unity of former AN members within the PdL, with most heavyweights of that party turning their back on their former leader. Fini, for his part, started attract to his faction some PdL members coming from various political backgrounds, from the former Radical Benedetto Della Vedova to former Christian Democrats such as Giuseppe Pisanu. On 22 April the National Committee of the PdL convened in Rome for the first time in a year. The conflict between Fini and Berlusconi was covered live by television. At the end of the day a resolution proposed by the party leadership was put before the assembly. The Finiani who voted against the resolution were 13 out of 172 members of the Committee: Roberta Angelilli, Andrea Augello, Italo Bocchino, Carmelo Briguglio, Cesare Cursi, Fabio Granata, Donato Lamorte, Silvano Moffa, Flavia Perina, Andrea Ronchi, Salvatore Tatarella, Adolfo Urso and Pasquale Viespoli. On 3 May Fini officially endorsed GI through a video message in the faction's website and encouraged his followers to form a network of GI circles all around Italy. In the meantime, group of moderate Finiani led by Augello and Moffa launched a group called Open Space, that included also some close supporters of Berlusconi coming from his former Forza Italia party, in order to distance themselves by the hardliners led by Bocchino and dialogue with Berlusconi, while the conservative supporters of Fini re-grouped themselves into National Area led by Roberto Menia and, again, Moffa. However, most Finiani, including Moffa and Menia chose to join also GI. Since then, clashes between Fini and Berlusconi became even more frequent and reached their heights in late July, when Fini questioned the morality of some party bigwigs under criminal investigation. On 29 July 2010 the party executive released a document (voted by 33 members out of 37) in which Fini was described as \\"incompatible\\" with the political line of the PdL and unable to perform his job of President of the Chamber of Deputies in a neutral way. Berlusconi asked Fini to step down from his post and the executive proposed the suspension from party membership for three hard-liner Finiani (Italo Bocchino, Fabio Granata and Carmelo Briguglio) who had harshly criticized Berlusconi and accused some party members of criminal offences. For both parts, this was the point of no turning back. On 30 July Fini and his followers (33 deputies and 10 senators, at the time) organised separate groups both in the Chamber and the Senate under the name Future and Freedom (FLI). Only a minority of the deputies and senators coming from National Alliance followed their former long-time leader Fini into the new party, but enough to hold the balance in the Chamber of Deputies. GI was the core of the new parliamentary groups. In the 2013 general election, FLI obtained 0.4% and no seats in the Chamber of Deputies. Both FLI and GI were disbanded soon after.

The mill has been restored to working order. The mill is officially designated as being held in reserve for use in times of emergency. It is listed as a Rijksmonument, number 39358. History De Eendracht was built in 1872 by millwright Otto R Posthumus to drain the De Eendracht Polder. Four Patent sails were fitted in 1899. In 1940, the sails were fitted with leading edges streamlined on the Dekker system. A diesel engine was added as auxiliary power in 1966, it was removed when the mill was restored in 1975. During this restoration, the Patent sails were removed, as was the Dekker system from the sails. Four Common sails were fitted. The mill was bought by Stichting De Fryske Mole () on 22 September 1982. In 1993, the mill was restored by Fabrikaat Buurma, Oudeschans, Groningen. At this time it carried one pair of Common sails and one pair of Patent sails fitted with Dekkerised leading edges. A new wooden windshaft was fitted by millwright Westra of Franeker in 1982. In 2006, the mill was designated by Wetterskip Frysl√¢n as being held in reserve for use in times of emergency. Description De Eendracht is what the Dutch describe as an Grondzeiler. It is a two-storey smock mill on a single-storey base. There is no stage, the sails reaching down almost to ground level. The mill is winded by tailpole and winch. The smock and cap are thatched. The sails are two Common sails and two Patent sails with Dekkerised leading edges. They have a span of . The sails are carried on a wooden windshaft. The windshaft also carries the brake wheel which has 52 cogs. This drives the wallower (32 cogs) at the top of the upright shaft. At the bottom of the upright shaft is the crown wheel, which has 46 cogs drives a gearwheel with 35 cogs on the axle of the Archimedes' screw. The axle of the Archimedes' screw is diameter. The screw is diameter and long. It is inclined at 20.4¬∞. Each revolution of the screw lifts of water. Public access De Eendracht is open by appointment, or when the mill is working.

Born in Florence, Italy, she lives between London and New York City.  Early life  Carolina Bucci was born in October 1976, in Florence, Italy. Career Bucci is the 4th generation of jewellers. In 1885, her great-grandfather, Ferdinando Bucci, opened a workshop in Florence, Italy, specialising in the sale and repair of gentlemen's pocket watches. He eventually began to make bespoke gold chains to accessorize his clients' timepieces, and from there he moved into the production of fine jewellery. His son, Fosco, took over the business in 1920, by which point they had gained success across Italy, and moved the showroom to Piazza Santo Stefano, next to Florence's Ponte Vecchio, the hub of artisans and goldsmiths. After the Second World War, her father grew the business internationally, particularly in the US and Japan, whilst continuing to anchor the manufacture of the jewellery in the family's Florentine workshops. Bucci took over, and is now the creative director, having studied at FIT.List of alumni of the Fashion Institute of Technology When she returned to Florence upon her graduation, she worked alongside local goldsmiths encouraging them to push the boundaries of their traditional practices to create her first collections, ‚ÄòLucky‚Äô (a reinvention of the friendship bracelets she made as a child) and then ‚ÄòWoven‚Äô, which saw her reinvent centuries-old Florentine textile looms to weave gold and silk threads, becoming two of her trademark collections; the third being her ‚ÄòFlorentine Finish‚Äô as seen on Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Frosted Gold watches. A selection of her designs are in the permanent jewellery collection of the Palazzo Pitti museum in Florence. In 2007 she established her London flagship store, and since then has aligned with retailers such as Harrods, Bergdorf Goodman, and Luisa Via Roma. In 2003 the cover of UK Vogue featured Salma Hayek wearing a Bucci necklace, which led to Bucci develop her first non-US retailer; London's multi-brand store Browns. Carolina Bucci jewellery is available in Harrods, Bergdorf Goodman, Hirsliefers, Luisa Via Roma and other stores, as well as Net A Porter and their on line store Carolinabucci.com. Bucci opened her first flagship store in Belgravia, London, in 2007, and a second in Porto Montenegro in 2011. In 2005 Sarah Jessica Parker wore a Carolina Bucci Lucky bracelet throughout the final series of 'Sex and the City' and marked the finale by gifting a Lucky bracelet to each member of the cast and crew. In 2010 Bucci launched '1885' a heritage inspired collection to celebrate the 125th anniversary of Carolina's great grandfather founding the company. In 2013, a 10th Anniversary edition of the Lucy Bracelet was launched. In 2014 she launched the ‚ÄòSprezzatura‚Äô Lucky bracelet with the brand signature Florentine Finish Bee charm. In 2016 she announced a collaboration with Audemars Piguet, to redesign their Royal Oak watch with her Florentine finish to celebrate the watch's 40th anniversary. In 2018 her London flagship store relocated to 22 Motcomb Street, London. 2018 also saw the launch of the FORTE beads collection. A collection based around a rainbow of precious hard stone beads, 18k Florentine Finish beads and Letters, named after the Italian sea side town of Forte Dei Marmi. In 2018 Carolina Bucci was won the award for the Gold category of the Couture Show Design Awards for her rainbow gold and silk woven scarf. For her second collaboration with Audemars Piguet, Bucci once again applied her signature Florentine Finish to the Limited Edition Royal Oak, this time in 18k yellow gold, alongside a silver toned mirror dial, in place of the traditional Tapisserie. In 2019 Bucci released a series of hand blown glasses, made in collaboration with the Murano glass maker Laguna B, as well as hand carved Carrara marble spheres and the application of her Florentine Finish to homeware.  Charitable collaborations  Bucci has produced an annual limited edition collection to benefit a selected charity. In 2008, the collaboration was with WaterAid, and in 2009, with Global Action for Children. 2010's collaboration was with (RED) with profits going to The Global Fund to help fight AIDS in Africa. In 2016 she launched a collaboration with Great Ormond Street Hospital, redesigning one of her Lucky bracelets, as well as creating a ‚Äòtwister‚Äô bracelet to benefit the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.

It lies south of the Wagner Basin with which it is closely linked. The depression is a result of subsidence caused by the extensional forces probably imparted by the same spreading center which has produced the Wagner Basin. Both basins are bounded on their eastern side by the Wagner Fault, a primarily normal (vertical motion) fault which dips approximately 60 degrees to the northwest. The western side of the basin is bounded by another normal fault, the Consag Fault which dips in a direction opposite the Wagner Fault. The seabed between these faults is sinking. The Consag Basin is linked to the Delfin Basin located to its south by a poorly understood deformation zone which further research may eventually define as a transform fault.

His experiences during the Battle of Messines and the Battle of Passchendaele, both in 1917, led him to resolve not to take human life, and for the rest of his army service he made deliberate errors in targeting calculations to try to ensure the guns of his battery missed their aiming point on the first attempt, giving the enemy a chance to evacuate. Many years later, after retiring from a career as a teacher, he wrote a memoir of his years in the army, describing his disillusionment with the conduct of the war and his conversion to pacifism. In 2010 the memoir was published as The Reluctant Tommy, edited by Duncan Barrett. Early life and war service Skirth was born in Chelmsford and grew up in Bexhill-on-Sea. In the First World War, having volunteered for the British Army under the Derby Scheme, and having requested that the process be expedited, he was called up in October 1916, two months before his 19th birthday. He became a Battery Commander's Assistant in the Royal Garrison Artillery, responsible for making the calculations necessary to target the large guns of a field battery. When he argued with a superior officer over whether to use a French church for target practice he was demoted in rank from Corporal to Bombardier.Barrett, Michele. Casualty Figures: How Five Men Survived the First World War. Verso, 2007, p. 67. Skirth saw action in the Battle of Messines, in which two of his closest friends, Bill and Geordie, were killed. On the same day he had an \\"epiphany\\" when he stumbled across the body of a dead German of about his own age, and realised that one of the shells he had targeted might well have killed him.Barrett 2007, pp. 70‚Äì72. This was to mark a turning point in his thinking about the war as he determined that he was morally responsible for his actions and for their consequences, despite the chain of command.Skirth and Barrett 2010, p. 77. During the Battle of Passchendaele, Skirth and another friend, Jock Shiels, left their post when they discovered that their commanding officer had ignored an order to withdraw from the front line. Skirth was knocked out by a shell which killed Shiels, and subsequently suffered from shell-shock and amnesia. Following a period of convalescence in hospital in France, he was sent to the Italian Front in December 1917, where his battery was being reorganised. There, following a relapse of shell-shock, he was treated in hospital in Schio and at the mud spa at Montegrotto.Barrett 2007, pp. 79‚Äì80. In Italy, Skirth made a resolution that he would do everything within his power to avoid further loss of human life.Barrett 2007, p.78. He felt that the \\"just war\\" he had signed up for was anything but just,Skirth and Barrett 2010, p.160. and was disillusioned with the army and the conduct of the war. In a church in the Italian village of San Martino, near Vicenza, he made a private pact with God that he would never again help to take a human life.Barrett 2007, pp. 76‚Äì78. He wrote to his future wife, Ella Christian, claiming that he had become a pacifist and a conscientious objector.Barrett 2007, p. 84. He also began a campaign of small acts of sabotage, introducing minor errors into his trajectory calculations so as to mistarget the guns, such that they \\"never once hit an inhabited target\\" on the first attempt, giving the enemy a chance to evacuate.Barrett 2007, p. 87. His actions were never discovered by his superiors. Apparently he carried out this sabotage while still in Italy where he remained until February 1919,Skirth and Barrett 2010, p.297. aside from a fortnight of leave back in England in November and December 1918.Skirth and Barrett 2010, p.280. He received the British War Medal and Victory Medal for his war service but declined the Military Medal, which he felt was offered as part of an attempt to whitewash a fatal accident he had tried to prevent.Barrett 2007, p. 89.

In his forties by this point and suffering from ill health, he was not expected to fight, but his anti-war views earned him the labels \\"crank, visionary, communistic and impractical\\".Skirth and Barrett 2010, p.344. After the war, the family returned to Ealing, where Skirth and his wife Ella lived, in various homes, throughout their life together,Skirth and Barrett 2010, pp.336, 338 and where he continued to work as a teacher until he took early retirement in 1958.Barrett 2007, p. 66. He died there in 1977.Skirth and Barrett 2010, p.xiii. Character and beliefs A self-confessed 'dreamer' with a romantic sensibility, Skirth was very fond of literature, and in particular poetry; he took with him to the Western Front a much-annotated copy of Francis Turner Palgrave's Golden Treasury. His favourite poets were John Keats, Percy Bysshe Shelley and Lord Byron.Barrett 2007, p. 68. He had an intense love of beauty, which he found all around him in music, architecture and the natural world. On the Western Front, he wrote, he was \\"deprived of the one thing that to me was as precious as life itself, my love of beauty\\".Skirth and Barrett 2010, p.130. Although Skirth had volunteered for the Army in 1915, as an idealistic patriot, convinced that \\"King and Country\\" were causes worth fighting for,Skirth and Barrett 2010, p.24. it was not long before he became disillusioned with the war and the army.Skirth and Barrett 2010, p.75. He attributed this to a combination of his sensitive character, his Christian upbringing and sense of right and wrong, and, most significantly, the horror of his war experiences.Skirth and Barrett 2010, pp.345, 351. After the war, Skirth remained a convinced pacifist for the rest of his life. He believed that Britain should not have declared war on Germany in 1939 and claimed that he would rather surrender and face occupation than take up arms against a hostile force.Skirth and Barrett 2010, p.351. Writing in the early 1970s, he expressed hope that the next generation of political leaders would not make the same mistakes as their forebears.Skirth and Barrett 2010, pp.352353. Memoir In January 1971, having retired from his teaching career, Skirth began work on a handwritten memoir which described his conduct and experiences during the First World War, and in particular his experience of disillusionment. Although he initially intended to focus on his relationship with his wife Ella, touching on the war only briefly, he soon felt under a \\"compulsion\\" to write more about his war experiences.Skirth and Barrett 2010, p.x. He worked on the memoir for over a year, eventually filling five green ring binders with many hundreds of pages, and over the next few years, despite suffering two strokes, he repeatedly went back to the material, editing, amending and adding to what he had written.Skirth and Barrett 2010, p.xii. Skirth gave the memoir to his daughter Jean in 1975, two years before his death in 1977. Although for many years she found it too upsetting to read in full, she felt that it was a story that should be shared with others, and in 1999 she donated four of the five ring binders, containing the bulk of the memoir but excluding its more personal sections, to the Imperial War Museum in London,Skirth and Barrett 2010, p.xiv. where they remain to this day.Imperial War Museum collections right Once it was made available to researchers and academics, Skirth's memoir began to attract attention, and his story was featured in Richard Schweitzer's The Cross and the Trenches (2003), Michele Barrett's Casualty Figures (2007), and in Ian Hislop's documentary Not Forgotten: The Men Who Wouldn't Fight (2008), in which Hislop interviewed Jean Skirth about her father's war experiences.Not Forgotten: The Men Who Wouldn't Fight, Series 3, Episode 1/1, Channel 4, 10 November 2008. =Publication= In 2010 the memoir was published in book form by Macmillan, as The Reluctant Tommy: Ronald Skirth's Extraordinary Memoir of the First World War, edited by Duncan Barrett. Barrett wrote in an introduction that he felt that Skirth's story \\"deserved as wide an audience as possible‚Äîand to be read in its protagonist's own words\\".Skirth and Barrett 2010, p.xv. Skirth's daughter Jean, who had given permission for the memoir to be published remained uncertain whether publishing the memoir was what her father would have wanted, but believed that it was important that his story should be widely known. The book carried a foreword by Channel 4 News anchor Jon Snow, in which he wrote about his grandfather Lieutenant-General Sir Thomas D'Oyly Snow. Referring to the popular description of the lower ranks as \\"lions led by donkeys\\", Snow acknowledged that \\"If Ronald Skirth was a 'lion', Thom Snow was ultimately a 'donkey'.\\"Skirth and Barrett 2010, p.viii. =Critical reaction= The Reluctant Tommy received largely favourable reviews by Richard Holmes in the Evening Standard and Jonathan Gibbs in the Financial Times, as well as coverage in Socialist Worker and, in an article written by the book's editor, the Sunday Express. Not all criticism has been favourable. A review in the BBC's Who Do You Think You Are magazine remarks on the disparities between official war records and Skirth's version of events: In response to general criticism received after initial publication that Skirth was a liar or a fantasist, Barrett revised his introduction to the paperback edition, published in 2011. He recognised that there were discrepancies between Skirth's account and historical sources which made his book an unreliable history, but still considered the book a valuable memoir of one man's personal experiences.Barrett 2011, pp. xxi‚Äìxxiii In 2011, The Sunday Times reported that Skirth had been \\"...exposed for character assassination...\\" and that the Imperial War Museum, which had held Skirth's memoirs since 1999, \\"...has admitted they are mostly fictional\\". The report was based on research begun by Ruth Ward as part of a campaign to clear the name of her grandfather, Bernard Bromley, who had served with Skirth and whose character Skirth had besmirched. Ward's research, which was lodged with the Imperial War Museum when it was completed in 2014, identified significant discrepancies in Skirth's account.Ward pp. 133‚Äì134 It revealed differences in the biographical information of characters and in events described by Skirth when compared to official historical sources.Ward pp. 138‚Äì147 Ward concludes that \\"Skirth's war memoir was not a genuine account, or a semi-fictional one, but a satire\\" which \\"unfairly represented genuine figures\\" to \\"subtly and implicitly\\" ridicule the shortcomings of the British Army.Ward p. 151 Footnotes Notes References *Barrett, Duncan. \\"Great War Hero who Vowed Not to Kill, Even if it Meant Sabotage\\", Sunday Express, 11 April 2010. *Barrett, Michele.

Dining options include Mexican food, pizza, salads, rotisserie chicken, coffee, and ice cream sandwiches. University of Denver students can use a meal plan swipe to get a variety of meal options and variations are offered with meal plan cash. The food and service are through Sodexo, who provides food for the entire school's dining halls and other dining options. There is also an organic option for students, including teas, sushi, Greek yogurt, and fruit. Honoring Construction Workers Since the 1999 construction of the Daniel L. Ritchie Center, new buildings on the DU campus have been carving the names of construction workers into the buildings they worked on, including the Robert and Judi Newman Center for Performing Arts in 2003 and Nagel Hall in 2008. These names are in alphabetical order to pay homage to the workers and is located under in the covered area just outside Nagel Hall. The names were put into a computer program that turned names into a plastic ‚Äúresist‚Äù pattern and then sandblasted onto the wall. Ralph and Trish Nagel DU board of the trustee‚Äôs Ralph and Trish Nagel donated $4 million to the Nagel Hall project who‚Äôs total cost was $37.8 million. Ralph Nagel entered the workforce as an architect and has since invested in commercial real estate, student housing, and self-storage centers. Nagel and his wife Trish founded the Meridian Retirement Communities in 1984 to ING, before selling it in 2005 for $240 million. Nagel is also an accomplished artist and he contributed his own works of art to be on display in Nagel Hall. Also, at his request, there is a residential room with studio space for an artist-in-residence program that is being developed in cooperation with the School of Art and Art History. Nagel also supported the recent construction of the Art Annex, as well as investing in many different Denver projects.

It is of interest as a local food source and for the aquarium trade. Its common names include honey sucker, sucking loach, Chinese algae eater, and Siamese algae eater; the FAO-endorsed common name is Siamese algae eater. G. aymonieri is found in the Chao Phraya basin, northern Malay Peninsula, Mekong basin (in Cambodia, Yunnan province in China, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam), Mae Klong basin and the Xe Bang Fai River. It is most often seen in large rivers, occasionally entering flooded fields. The fish spends most of its time on flat surfaces, such as rocks, in flowing water, using its unusually formed inferior mouth to attach itself to rocks in stronger flows. The fish are sold in local markets as a food source and small fish are used in preparation of prahok.  Physical description  G. aymonieri has been recorded as reaching at least SL and is the only species in the genus to have 9 branched dorsal rays and 36‚Äì40 lateral line scales.Quoting Kottelat (1998): \\"Distinguished from the other species of the genus in having 9 branched dorsal rays, 36‚Äì40 lateral line scales and no dark spots on pelvic and anal fins. Size up to at least 280 mm SL\\" The mouth is inferior with a special \\"sucker\\" modification which allows the fish to attach itself to smooth surfaces. No barbels are present. Wild type colour varies from pale grey to olive, with darker markings along the lateral line which vary from a solid stripe with alternating higher and lower extensions to uneven dots. The belly is usually paler than the base colour. Some darker markings may also be observed along the back and on the caudal fin, but no dark markings occur on the pelvic and anal fins. Name The scientific name commemorates the French linguist and explorer √âtienne Aymonier.Order CYPRINIFORMES: Families PSILORHYNCHIDAE, GYRINOCHEILIDAE and CATOSTOMIDAE The ETYFish Project  In aquaria  Golden G. aymoneiri G. aymonieri is similar in colouration to a number of other species which are commonly available in the aquarium trade, such as Crossocheilus oblongus, Epalzeorhynchos kalopterus, and Garra cambodgiensis, and is sometimes misidentified as one of these species. It is available in a number of colour morphs, including wild type, gold, marble, albino, and leucistic forms. The species does not breed readily in home aquaria, although fry are occasionally reported as being found in overgrown aquaria. At this time, no definitive spawning triggers are known. Sexing is difficult, although mature males may develop breeding tubercles on their noses, while females become plumper. G. aymonieri fish are often bought as algae eaters because they will readily eat algae when young, but with age, their preference changes towards meatier foods, such as prepared aquarium foods, frozen crustaceans and small fish. This change is also reflected in behaviour, which becomes aggressive with age, especially so towards others of their own kind and fish with similar colors. They also feed off of the body slime on other fish, making them more prone to infection and stress. The other species in the genus, Gyrinocheilus pennocki and the Gyrinocheilus pustulosus, are rarely seen in the aquarium trade.

Located northeast of Laurelville in Hocking County, the mound sits on a ridgeline; it is tall and approximately in diameter.

Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 774. The mound's location and conical shape indicates that it is a work of the Adena culture, which was active between 1000 BC and AD 400. Occupation of the vicinity was not seemingly limited to the Adena period; approximately away from the Deffenbaugh Mound is a stone mound perhaps built by the Fort Ancient culture, perhaps more than one thousand years after the construction of the Deffenbaugh Mound. In 1974, the Deffenbaugh Mound was listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its potential to be a valuable archaeological site.

In 1662 he entered in the service of the French Navy and was wounded in 1663 in a battle with 3 Algerian corsairs. in 1667 he was promoted to captain and fought under Fran√ßois, Duke of Beaufort in the Siege of Candia in 1669. In the Franco-Dutch War he commanded the Vaillant in the Battle of Solebay in 1672, the Conqu√©rant in the Battle of Schooneveld in 1673 and again the Vaillant in the Battle of Texel. In 1674‚Äì1675 he commanded the Actif and defeated Engel de Ruyter near The Lizard.

In the lost Battle of La Hogue, he saved part of his division and passed with the remaining 2 ships Monarque and Aimable, through the Straits of Dover and led them north-about round Britain. The Marquis of Nesmond then gained a reputation as a formidable raider, capturing many ships and their valuable cargos. In the Battle of Lagos (1693) he captured two Dutch warships and several merchant ships from the Smyrna Convoy. In 1695 he captured the English warship Esp√©rance (72) and later that year, two merchant ships from the East India Company.

It is based on the fact that after a ceramic specimen is removed from the kiln at the time of production, it immediately begins to recombine chemically with moisture from the environment. This reaction reincorporates hydroxyl (OH) groups into the ceramic material, and is described as rehydroxylation (RHX). The RHX process produces an increase in specimen weight. This weight increase provides an accurate measure of the extent of rehydroxylation. The dating clock is provided by the experimental finding that the RHX reaction follows a precise kinetic law: the weight gain increases as the fourth root of the time which has elapsed since firing. This so-called power law and the RHX method which follows from it were discovered by scientists from the University of Manchester and the University of Edinburgh. The concept of RHX dating was first stated in 2003 by Wilson and collaborators who noted that \\"results ... suggest a new method for archaeological dating of ceramics\\". The RHX method was then described in detail in 2009 for brick and tile materials, and in relation to pottery in 2011. RHX dating is not yet routinely or commercially available. It is the subject of a number of research and validation studies in several countries. Power-law kinetics According to the RHX power-law, if the weight of a fired-clay ceramic increases as a result of RHX by 0.1% in 1 yr from firing, then the weight increase is 0.2% in 16 yr, 0.3% in 81 yr and 0.4% in 256 yr (and so on). The RHX method depends on the validity of this law for describing long-term RHX weight gain on archaeological timescales. There is now strong support for power-law behaviour from analyses of long-term moisture expansion data in brick ceramic, some of which now extends over more than 60 y. Moisture expansion and weight gain are known to be proportional to each other for a specified material at any specified firing temperature. Dating methodology A small piece of the ceramic is first removed, weighed, and heated to 500 ¬∞C, effectively dehydrating it completely. The amount of water lost in the dehydration process (and thus the amount of water gained since the ceramic was created) is measured with a microbalance. Once removed from the furnace, the sample is monitored to determine the precise rate at which it combines with atmospheric moisture. Once that RHX rate is determined, it is possible to calculate exactly how long ago it was removed from the kiln. If the date of firing of a certain ceramic were known from another source, the method could be used inversely to determine the average temperature of the object's environment since firing. Technical issues The RHX rate is largely insensitive to the ambient humidity because the RHX reaction occurs extremely slowly, and only minute amounts of water are required to feed it. Sufficient water is available in virtually all terrestrial environments. Neither systematic nor transient changes in humidity have an effect on long-term rehydroxylation kinetics, though they do affect instantaneous gravimetric measurements or introduce systematic error (i.e. through capillary condensation). The rate of rehydroxylation is affected by the ambient temperature. Thus, when calculating dates, scientists must be able to estimate the temperature history of the sample. The method of calculation is based on temperature data for the location, with adjustments for burial depth and long-term temperature variation from historical records. This information is used to estimate an effective lifetime temperature or ELT which is then used in the dating calculation. The ELT is generally close to (but not exactly the same as) the long-term annual mean surface air temperature. For southern England this is about 11 ¬∞C. Any event involving exposure to extreme heat may reset the \\"clock\\" by dehydroxylating the specimen, as though it were just out of the kiln. For example, a medieval brick examined by Wilson and collaborators produced a dating result of 66 years. In fact this brick had been dehydroxylated by the intense heat of incendiary bombing and fires during World War II. The main application of the RHX technique is to date archaeological ceramics. Yet most archaeological material contains components which causes either addition mass gain or additional mass loss during the RHX measurement process. These components can be an intrinsic part of the object, for example materials added as temper, or compounds which have become incorporated into the object during use, for example organic residues, or compounds which have entered into the object during burial or conservation. Research The RHX technique was the product of a three-year study by a collaboration of University of Manchester and University of Edinburgh researchers, led by Moira Wilson. Though it has only been established on bricks and tiles of up to 2,000 years of age, research is continuing to determine whether RHX can be accurately used on any fired-clay material, for example earthenware of up to 10,000 years of age. The original work of Wilson and co-workers was undertaken on construction materials, bricks and tiles. Transferring the method to ceramics has brought additional challenges but initial results have demonstrated that ceramics have the same ‚Äúinternal clock‚Äù as bricks. Several other studies have attempted to replicate the RHX technique, but using archaeological ceramics. These studies have encountered issues with components within the ceramics causing either addition mass gain or additional mass loss during the RHX measurement process. The quality of data generated by the Manchester and Edinburgh groups has been due to analysing fired-clay materials which do not contain these components. Efforts to successfully replicate the original work and overcome the challenges presented by archaeological ceramics are underway in several academic institutions worldwide.

Marsh was born in Bath, Somerset. He was educated at Sherborne School and New College, Oxford. Career Marsh's first group was at school; Jeremy Irons was the drummer. After Oxford, Marsh joined a group with, among others, John G. Perry, at first called Toast, which expanded to become Gringo. He was invited in 1973 by Phil Pickett to join a group called Kajanus Pickett, after Pickett and Georg Kajanus. The group became Sailor with the inclusion of Grant Serpell. Sailor's original line-up split up in 1978, although Pickett and Marsh released more material as Sailor with Gavin and Virginia David in 1980, with an album of Pickett compositions called Dressed for Drowning. After Sailor disbanded, he worked with Kajanus on DATA and \\"And The Mamluks\\", a short-lived electronic- music project. Marsh eventually teamed up with writer Barry Mason in 1986. They and David H. Bell, a Broadway director, wrote a musical called Malibu, first performed in 1991. He wrote another musical, Casper‚ÄîThe Musical, with Pickett in 1999. Marsh has written musical scores for theatre productions including Romeo and Juliet, The Grapes of Wrath and The Dark at the Top of the Stairs. He received the Joseph Jefferson Award for Best Original Music in Theater Production in 1998 for The Comedy of Errors, and in 1999 for Much Ado About Nothing. He also received a best composer nomination for As You Like It in 2002. In 2004 he was nominated for two Jefferson Awards for The Taming of the Shrew and A Midsummer Night's Dream. His musical theatre work in the USA includes One Last Summer, In Stitches and Female Problems for which he received a nomination for Best New Work.

His philosophical outlook on life is also embedded in his lifestyle. That lifestyle resonates in his lyrics and his melodies. Religion is the first tier of the foundation of Brunache's prose. Brunache says: \\"I always meditate through yoga before writing.\\" A devout vegetarian, he openly admits to his fascination with religion: Zen Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Voodoo as well as various branches of Christianity. It was these teachings that fed his knowledge of self- enlightenment. \\"Knowing myself enables me to better understand others,\\" he explains. Brunache so believed in his theory, that in the early 1980s he became a theology student. The need for artistic expression did not lag far behind. As a child Brunache had a natural inclination for the arts. In the mid-1980s, he enrolled in one of Haiti's most prestigious arts institutions, the National School for the Arts. In Dramatic arts, Brunache became a composer, producer and a self-taught guitarist. Poetry is an integral part of his music, Brunache does not sacrifice melodies in his message to the world. Like many Haitians, Brunache a native of Grand-Anse, Haiti's southwest region renowned for its strong political foresight and rebellion, is firmly grounded in his political ideals. Politics first put him in the spotlight of Haiti's social-political and cultural movement, long before big U.S record companies saw fit to invest in cross over racine/roots bands like Boukman Eksperyans. Some would argue that his devotion to preserve this African-based musical tradition came even before notable roots bands like Boukan Ginen, Koudjay, Ram, and Kampech decided to embrace and capitalize on it. Playing an active role in the Musical Freedom Movement, Brunache and his then newly founded five piece Band Tonm-Tonm (the name of a popular peasant delicacy of Jeremie) \\"sang for all of Haiti,\\" says Brunache, but wanted to help transform the country to benefit the masses, more specifically, the poor. For this, his popularity rose substantially. So much so that his roots band specializing in a style of music known as \\"pile\\", (a double entendre meaning to \\"step on\\" as well as \\"to grind\\") performed at the Sylvio Cator Stadium, one of Haiti's largest venues. They also performed for President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti's first democratically elected president, on the eve of his inauguration. During the tail-end of the Duvalier regime, one of Tonm Tonm's group members was sentenced and spent two months in Fort Dimanche, a prison notoriously known as Fort La Mort, or \\"Fort of Death\\". After his release, he later died. Despite this tragedy, Tonm-Tonm began putting together their first album. But once again political hardship changed their fate. The 1991 coup that ousted Aristide led to turbulent times, even for artists. As fear and violence spread across Haiti, many fled to save their lives. Shortly after, another of the group's members was killed, leaving Brunache and one other member as the sole survivors.

Pell Green is in the parish of Wadhurst in Wealden, one of six local government districts in the English county of East Sussex, and stands on the road between the market town of Wadhurst and the village of Lamberhurst in the county of Kent. Built in 1824 to replace an earlier meeting place for local Baptists, it continued in religious use until the late 20th century. The weatherboarded building‚Äînow a house‚Äîis of a similar design to another Baptist chapel at nearby Shover's Green. The building is Grade II listed. History Pell Green, one of several tiny settlements in Wadhurst's parish, is about northeast of the town. In common with many places in Sussex, a county known for its broad range of Christian denominations, a Strict Baptist community developed in the early 19th century. Their first meetings in Pell Green were held in 1818. Six years later, Thomas Kemp founded and built a new chapel immediately to the west of an existing cottage to serve the community. It was successful enough to require regular extensions in its early years; work was carried out in 1828, 1831 and 1841. The original three- bay east‚Äìwest layout gained a fourth bay to the west, and a lean-to was subsequently attached to this. Over the years, many memorials in various forms were installed in the chapel, and formed its most important feature. The earliest, dated 1836, commemorated a local woman and was added to as more family members died. In 1844, a memorial to a member of the Kemp family was placed on the south wall; again, more names were added later. Most memorials were in the form of painted wooden boards, although there were also some stone slabs and headstones. Immersion baptism took place in a stream nearby. The religious census of Sussex in 1851 recorded that the \\"Rehoboth Calvinistic Baptist Chapel\\" had 500 sittings, all of which were free; and attendances at morning and afternoon services were given as 235 and 300 respectively. Attendances declined in the 20th century, and in 1986 conversion to a house was suggested. This happened soon afterwards, and the building is still in residential use. Some changes have been made, such as the removal of original shutters on the south-facing windows. The chapel's registration for the solemnisation of marriages was formally cancelled by the General Register Office in March 1980. The Rehoboth Chapel was Grade II listed on 12 April 1978. Architecture The chapel is a weatherboarded single-storey building with timber-framed walls and a slate-tiled roof with eaves. The construction date of 1824 is visible on a stone on the exterior. The three original bays have, from east to west, a large round-arched window, a doorway with a straight hood mould, and another window in the same style. The westernmost bay has an identical window and a small door, again flat-hooded. The windows are sashes and originally had wooden shutters. The building was mostly of timber construction inside. A three-sided gallery was held up by wooden columns with decorative mouldings at the top and bottom, and three king posts supported the roof (two in the original part of the chapel and one in the western extension).

Due to his performance during training he joined HLeLv 24, flying the Fokker D.XXI in May 1939. In summer 1939 he was promoted to Sergeant. As the Winter War broke out, Sgt. Nissinen first claimed an air victory on 1 December 1939, claiming a SB-2 shot down and damaging two others over Viipuri. By the end of the Winter War he had claimed four victories in total and was a Sergeant Major. HLeLv 24 then equipped with the US- built Brewster Buffalo. As hostilities broke out again on 25 June 1941 Nissinen again flew operationally. On 7 July 1941 over K√§kisalmi two enemy fighters attacked head-on, Nissinen shooting down both. On 21 July 1941 he again shot down a I-153 in a head-on battle, although his aircraft was damaged and he returned to base. His ground crew found four hits in the engine, one in the prop and several more in the wings. On 1 August 1941 at Rautj√§rvi six Buffalos engaged eight Soviet I-16 fighters, Nissinen's target exploding and its debris damaged Nissinen's right wing. Three I-16s attacked from behind and his fighter took several hits, shattering the windscreen. At the end of 1941 Nissinen was the second highest scoring FAF ace with 15.5 kills. Early in 1942 Nissinen attended Officer Cadet School, from where he then graduated in June 1943 as a Lieutenant. Nissinen was awarded the Mannerheim Cross on 5 July 1942, his number being 69. He held the rank of v√§nrikki at the time. Returning to HLeLv 24 Nissinen was made a flight commander and resumed flying missions. His score increased to 26 by the end of 1943. The squadron gradually re-equipped with Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters in spring 1944. In May 1944 HLeLv 32, flying the Curtiss P-36, was temporarily strengthened with a Messerschmitt Bf 109G-2 flight commanded by Lt. Nissinen. On 16 May Nissinen scrambled against a single Lavochkin La-5 approaching Nurmoila. The La-5 circled at 1500 m and allowed Nissinen climb to the same altitude before turning to attack from above, shooting down the La-5 after a series of exhausting attacks. With the renewed Soviet offensive on 9 June 1944 Lt. Nissinen scored two more victories on 17 June 1944 as two flights intercepted Soviet Il-2 ground attack aircraft attacking Finnish positions at Kaukj√§rvi. Nissinen's wingman, Sgt. Heimo Lampi saw the crippled Messerschmitt of Lt. Sarjamo dive through the cloud and collide with Nissinen's plane. Both planes exploded on impact and the pilots were killed. Nissinen flew some 300 missions and scored 32 victories in total. His grave is in Valkeala.

He continued to be an influential politician in the Nigerian Fourth Republic and was one of the founders of the Action Congress of Nigeria (AC) party in September 2006. Some sources have attributed the following quote to him prior to the 2011 presidential election: \\"The North is determined if it happens, to make Nigeria 'ungovernable' for President Jonathan or any other Southerner who finds his way to the seat of power on the platform of the PDP against the principle of the party's zoning policy.\\" Early life and education Kaita was born on 4 October 1932 in Katsina, in the far north of Nigeria. He is a blood relative of President Umaru Musa Yar'Adua and a member of the royal family of Nagogo, traditional rulers of the Emirate of Katsina. He attended Barewa College, Zaria (1946-1950) and later studied at the London School of Economics (1971-1972). Career After returning to Nigeria, Kaita joined the Kaduna State civil service. He served as Secretary to the State Water Board (1973-1975), Commissioner for Economic Planning (1975-1976) and Deputy Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Works of Kaduna State (1976-1977). =Early political career= Kaita was appointed a Member of the Constituent Assembly of Nigeria (1977-1978) and became Special Assistant to President Shehu Shagari (1980-1982). In 1979, he was narrowly defeated by Abdulkadir Balarabe Musa in the election for Governor of Kaduna State. Kaita helped the NPN to impeach Governor Musa in June 1981. In 1982, after the death of the Emir, Kaita contested the emirship of Katsina.Usman Nagogo. He was elected Governor of Kaduna State in the 1983 election, holding office for a few months until the military coup in December of that year. In 1995, after General Shehu Musa Yar'Adua was jailed by the Sani Abacha government, Kaita was appointed leader of Yar'Adua's Peoples Democratic Movement (PDM) which comprised politicians such as Atiku Abubakar, Abdullahi Aliyu Sumaila, Magaji Abdullahi and Rabiu Kwankwaso. The PDM merged with The New Dimension, The National Transformation Congress, some prominent members of the Eastern Mandate Union and some State chapters of the Committee for National Consensus (CNC) to form Peoples Consensus Party under which they seek registration during the Sani Abacha transition but they were not registered. Kaita was a member of the Constitutional Conference (1994-1995). He was a founding member of the People's Democratic Party PDP in 1998. Fourth Republic The administration of President Olusegun Obasanjo, which came to power in May 1999, appointed Kaita chairman of one of the parastatals in the Ministry of Transport. In August 2001, he was engaged in a struggle for control of the PDM movement with the Minister of Works and Housing, Tony Anenih. In May 2002, he was president of the Nigerian Polo Association. In June 2003, he was chairman of the Maritime Authority, a member of the board of trustees of the PDP, and a director of the SGBN Bank. Kaita left the PDP to join others in forming the Action Congress (AC) party in September 2006; Vice President Atiku Abubakar, representing the Action Congress, launched his unsuccessful bid for the presidency in 2007. In the run-up to the elections, the 74-year-old Kaita was arrested by the State Security Services on charges that he had recruited and trained hooligans. In March 2010, there were rumors that Kaita might be returning to the PDP following a meeting with the Katsina State Governor Ibrahim Shema and other PDP leaders. In a newspaper interview in April 2010, Kaita said that as chairman of a conclave of Atiku Abubakar's associates, he expected Atiku to rejoin the PDP. On 19 August 2010, Kaita was received back to the PDP by Governor Shema, in an event attended by 50,000 decampees from the Action Congress in Ingawa, Kusada and Kankia local governments. He died on 2 January 2018, aged 85.

In 1877, many changes were made to both the Model 1873 rifle and the Model 1873 carbine (the carbine was just a shorter version of the rifle). Historically, the Model 1877 rifle has just been considered to be a variant of the Model 1873, while the Model 1877 carbine has been considered to be a separate model. The most visible change was made to the stock. The buttstock comb was extended further forward on the wrist to strengthen the wrist's weak spot. The wrist itself was also thickened. Prior to 1877, the breechblock had a high arch machined out of it, making it lighter. The Model 1877 no longer had the arch machined out of it, though the reason for this modification is not clear. Gas ports along the upper ridges of the receiver were also extended, which may explain why the arch on the breechblock was removed at the same time. After the Battle of Little Bighorn, Springfield Armory was assigned the task of providing a cleaning rod for the carbine version that could also be used to remove stuck cartridges. A three piece steel rod was designed that fit into the butt. This required a new butt plate specifically for the carbine, as the longer rifle already included a ramrod and did not need these modifications. The rear sight was also modified. The rifle version of the new sight was stamped with an R, and the carbine version was stamped with a C. The different sights were necessary because the carbine used a 55-grain cartridge instead of the rifle's 70-grain cartridge.

UM is a member of Interpublic Group, operating under the IPG Mediabrands branch. Some of its regional offices are known as Universal Media rather than Universal McCann but are still generally all known as UM.  History  UM was established in 1999 as part of McCann Worldgroup, but its roots go back to 1902 when Alfred Erickson founded Erickson Company. Harrison King McCann‚Äôs agency, founded in 1912, evolved independently from Erickson‚Äôs. In 1930, H.K. McCann Company and Erickson Company merged to form McCann Erickson, a $15 million agency with Erickson as its chair and McCann as its president. After winning the Ford Motor Company account in 1933, the agency continued to acquire agencies and accounts including Coca-Cola. By 1957, McCann Erickson was the first US agency to top $100 million annually in TV and radio billings. Marion Harper, who replaced McCann as President-CEO in 1948, went on to create Interpublic Group in 1960, as the first marketing services management holding company. In 1971, Interpublic Group went public as IPG, and by 1972 was the largest agency in non-US billings. Today, IPG operates in over 100 countries, employs 41,800 marketing professionals, and generates revenue of US $6.5 billion. By 1993, McCann Erickson was the number one agency in the world. As the advertising industry began to integrate its services, McCann Erickson underwent a reinvention to form a consolidated agency network and launched McCann Worldgroup in 1997. Today, McCann Worldgroup oversees FutureBrand, McCann, McCann Healthcare Worldwide, Momentum Worldwide, MRM//McCann, UM, Weber Shandwick, and Craft Worldwide UM was originally launched by McCann Worldgroup as worldwide media buying arm, operating as a separate yet interdependent unit. When IPG formed Mediabrands in 2008 to oversee its media agencies and enable performance across multiple media platforms, UM, today a global full- service media agency, was included under the Mediabrands umbrella along with its agency partners Initiative, BPN, Orion Holdings, and ID Media, in addition to Mediabrands' specialty services Magna Global, IPG Media Lab, Shopper Sciences, Ensemble Branded Content, Identity, and Mediabrands Audience Platform (MAP), which comprises Cadreon, Reprise Media, Ansible, Initiative Media and Spring Creek Group. UM employs over 4,800 employees in its more than 130 offices in over 100 countries worldwide. UM's global headquarters is in New York with six other locations in North America: Dallas, Detroit, Los Angeles, Miami, San Francisco and Toronto. UM has regional offices in Asia- Pacific, Latin America, Europe, Middle East and Africa. UM has created a cluster structure which assembles countries by business similarities rather than by geographical locations. In this structure, there are three main market segments (North America, G14, and World Markets). This approach supports a consistent product across markets, centralizes teams, and reduces operational costs.
