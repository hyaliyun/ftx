ISSN 1368-485X Design and development The original version of the T-Bird family was the Teratorn Tierra which was introduced in 1983. The aircraft achieved early success in the ultralight market, particularly in its side-by-side seating version, the Tierra II. The design passed from Teratorn to Golden Circle Air in 1989 and the aircraft was renamed the T-Bird. Golden Circle Air went out of business in the mid-2000s and the design was out of production until 2011, when Indy Aircraft resumed building them. Over 4000 of all models have been built. The T-Bird is constructed from 6061-T6 aluminium tubing, bolted together, with the wing and tail surfaces covered in pre-sewn Mylar-coated Dacron envelopes. The cockpit area has a Lexan windshield and optional zippered cloth doors. The basic versions have conventional landing gear, with some models offering tricycle gear as an option. The cockpit controls consist of conventional rudder pedals and yoke control wheels. Construction time for the T-Bird I was reported as 60 hours. The Tierra II introduced a 13-position trim system and also 13-position flaps. The T-Bird I can qualify for the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles category if equipped with a light enough engine, such as the Rotax 277, although reviewers have indicated that due to the high- drag design the aircraft is under-powered. PilotMix describes the T-Bird I as \\"the most respected kit in the industry, and for good reason. It is absolutely the strongest and the easiest ultralight to build.\\" Reviewer Andre Cliche calls it \\"robust...heavy and solid\\".

The lighthouse is located on the western side of the island. It was the third lighthouse erected in Queensland after its formation in 1859 and the first in Australia to be constructed of a timber frame clad with iron plates. The original lighthouse was deactivated in 1995 and the light was replaced by a modern skeletal tower standing close to the original lighthouse. History =Establishment= Aerial view of old and new lighthouses The Government of Queensland was formed in 1859. In 1862, the Queensland government appointed the first Portmaster, Commander George Poynter Heath. However, it was only in 1864 that two committees were appointed to deal with the issue of coastal lighthouses. Lady Elliot Island was one of the locations mentioned by the committees as a possible suitable site for the construction of a lighthouse. The first navigation light to actually be installed on Lady Elliot Island was installed two years later, in 1866, in connection with the guano mining company operating on the island which started in 1863. It was a temporary light installed on a tall mast, which survived until 1871. 1872 according to when it was destroyed by a gale and rebuilt. Lighthouse architectural plans, 1874 In 1872 plans were drawn for a new lighthouse, and tenders were called. The winning tender, for ¬£749, was by the brothers John and Jacob Rooney of Maryborough, which also constructed Sandy Cape Light, Cowan Cowan Point Light, Cape Capricorn Light, Cape Bowling Green Light and Booby Island Light. The lighthouse was established in 1873, the third to be erected in Queensland since its formation in 1859, following Bustard Head Light in 1869 and Sandy Cape Light in 1870. By then, the guano mining operation has almost completely cleared the vegetation on the island. This was made worse by a herd of goats which were imported for meat and milk, which ate all growing vegetation. As the island had little topographical features to offer protection, to begin with, the station was completely unprotected from the powers of nature. The lighthouse construction was the first of its kind in Australia. Unlike previous lighthouse using bolted segments of cast iron, the first of which were Troubridge Island Lighthouse constructed in 1856 in South Australia and the original Breaksea Island Light constructed in 1858 in Western Australia, as well as Sandy Cape Light and Bustard Head Light in Queensland, the tower used wrought iron. Note that and say cast iron. plates mounted on a timber frame which supplied the structural strength, where the iron plates act as cladding. This was a cheaper method of construction, and following lighthouses in Queensland used this method predominantly. The iron cladding was prefabricated in England and shipped to the island in pieces, together with the imported lens, lantern and operating apparatus. The timber framing was prefabricated in Brisbane and shipped to the site. The light was originally a flashing 4,000 cd light. The lighthouse was tended by a single lighthouse keeper, assisted by a member of the guano mining company when required, and only one cottage was constructed. =Development= left By 1874 the guano mining on the island has ceased, and a second cottage was built soon after. The residences were to be rebuilt twice more. The first time was sometime in the 1900s. The second time was in 1925 when three new cottages were built as well as the boat shed and two more sheds for maintenance and storage. In 1923 the light was upgraded from 4,000 cd to 23,000 cd. In 1928 it was upgraded again, to 85,000 cd, and the pedestal on which the lantern is positioned was modified. A weather station was established in 1939. In 1953 the lightstation was electrified and in 1982 it was automated. However, the station remained staffed due to the importance of the weather station. In 1988 the lighthouse was finally demanned. The mechanism was replaced by a solar powered light, and finally on 19 October 1988, the light keepers left. =Deactivation= The second half of the 20th century marked the re-vegetation of the island, which was to result in the final deactivation of the lighthouse. In 1966 lighthouse staff started the re- vegetation programme. The herd of goats was shot by the lighthouse staff in 1969. Casuarina trees which were planted by Don Adams in 1969 were allowed to grow over the years, and by 1995 the light was obscured. A new lighthouse was constructed by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), and the old lighthouse was shut down. Current structure and display The current active light is a square steel skeletal tower. It is topped by a white fiberglass hut with a gallery. The fully automated light consists of six beams and is solar powered, The light characteristic shown is a white flash every 7.5 seconds (Fl.W. 7.5s), visible for . A racon showing \\"B\\" is mounted at focal height of .List of Lights Structures =The lighthouse= The lighthouse is largely in its original form. It is round in form and conical in shape. The base of the tower is a massive concrete floor cast within a low stone wall, with a segmented cast iron ring bolted to it. The tower is made of a timber frame clad with galvanised wrought iron plates, about thick. The plates are riveted at the joints and screwed to the timber frame and the base ring. The tower is painted white. It is topped by a gallery and a lantern, both painted white, with the lantern dome painted red. One addition to the original plan was the addition of a skillion roofed entrance porch to the base of the tower. view of the stair from the first floor The inside of the lighthouse is divided into four storeys with timber floors. A central weight tube provides support to a winding timber stair that goes up to the third level. Access to the fourth level, the gallery and the lantern is via a fixed ladder. =Other structures= The station also includes three fibro clad cottages and some associated structures. The cottages, set in a row, are located about from the lighthouse, as was the practice at the time. Other structures located around the lighthouse include an old powerhouse, a workshop (which was formerly used as a radio room) a fuel store and a newer powerhouse. These were all used to be in a fenced compound, but the fence was removed sometime in the late 1990s. Other structures in the compound include a boat shed, as well as solar panels and weather recording equipment. Site operation and visiting The current lighthouse is operated by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. The site is managed by the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service as part of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. The island can be reached only by air.

He is a professor of Humanities and Culture at Southern Oregon University in Ashland, Oregon. Background Battistella studied Slavic languages and literatures at Rutgers College, completing a BA in 1976, and linguistics at the City University of New York Graduate School and University Center, receiving a Ph.D. in 1981. His dissertation, Topics in the Theory of Inflection, written under the direction of Robert Fiengo, developed the early theory of abstract case introduced in Noam Chomsky‚Äôs 1980 article \\"On Case Theory\\".Battistella, Edwin. 1981. Topics in the Theory of Inflection. Ph.D. dissertation, City Univ. of New York. DAI #AAC8203267. Also reproduced from Indiana University Linguistics Club (Bloomington, IN 1982). The dissertation proposed that many instances of grammatical agreement could be treated as the assignment of abstract case features from clauses to the categories they contained, making a distinction between inherent and assigned case features. Scholarly contributions Battistella is the author of two books on the theory of markedness. Markedness: The Evaluative Superstructure of Language, was a study of the Prague School principle of structural asymmetry as developed by Nikolai Trubetzkoy and Roman Jakobson.Battistella, Edwin. Markedness: The Evaluative Superstructure of Language. SUNY Press, 1990. In Markedness, Battistella identified the diagnostics of marked and unmarked opposites in Jakobson‚Äôs work from the 1920s through the 1980s, proposed a comprehensive set of markedness values for English grammar and connected markedness to the idea of intrinsic hierarchy. In The Logic of Markedness, Battistella more explicitly developed the connections between Jakobson‚Äôs ideas and those of Noam Chomsky and Morris Halle, attempting to reconcile structuralist and generative views of markedness.Battistella, Edwin. The Logic of Markedness. Oxford University Press, 1996. Two later books have focused on 19th and 20th century language attitudes. Bad Language: Are Some Words Better Than Others? published in 2005, develops the case for a linguistically informed view of usage rather one based on oversimplifications and folklore.Battistella, Edwin. Bad Language: Are Some words Better Than Others? Oxford University Press, 2005. Do You Make These Mistakes in English? The Story of Sherwin Cody‚Äôs Famous Language School, published in 2009, combined a biography of correspondence school entrepreneur Sherwin Cody with an exploration of language and cultural attitudes that made self-improvement and correspondence learning educational forces in the first half of the twentieth century.Battistella, Edwin. Do You Make These Mistakes in English? The Story of Sherwin Cody‚Äôs Famous Language School. Oxford University Press, 2008. A fifth book, his 2014 Sorry About That: The Language of Public Apology, analyzes the public apologies of politicians, entertainers, businessmen, and others, with the goal of showing how certain language creates sincere or insincere apologies.Battistella, Edwin Sorry About That: The Language of Public Apology. Oxford University Press, 2014. The work connects actual apologies with the broader social, ethical, and linguistic principles behind them. His 2020 book, Dangerous Crooked Scoundrels: Insulting the President, from Washington to Trump, analyzes and categorizes over 500 political insults aimed at the forty-five U.S. presidents and how they responded. https://www.amazon.com/Dangerous-Crooked-Scoundrels-Insulting- Washington/dp/019005090X/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=dangerous+crooked+scoundrels&qid;=1575983732&s;=digital- text&sr;=1-1-catcorrhttps://global.oup.com/academic/product/dangerous-crooked- scoundrels-9780190050900?cc=us‚ü®=en& The work puts political insults in historical context, emphasize the importance of the First Amendment, and shows contemporary American politics to be part of a broader narrative. In addition, Professor Battistella is the author of a number of articles and book chapters on pronoun reference, the syntax of the English verb system, traditional grammar and style. Professional activities Battistella has held teaching, administrative and research positions at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, the 1986 Linguistic Society of America Summer Institute, the IBM Thomas J.

He has been at Southern Oregon University since 2000, serving as Dean of Arts and Letters from 2000 to 2006 and as Interim Provost from 2007 to 2008. From 1995 to 2001, Battistella served as the first book review editor for Language, the journal of the Linguistic Society of America. In 2014, he began a three-year term on the Society's Executive Committee. In 2006 he became the editor of Wiley-Blackwell‚Äôs Linguistic Abstracts, succeeding D. Terence Langendoen, and he and Rochelle Lieber became the founding editors-in-chief of Wiley- Blackwell's peer-reviewed online journal Language and Linguistics Compass. In 1986, he served as an expert witness for the American Civil Liberties Union, in a Federal Court case in which a trucker challenged an Alabama state statute prohibiting the public display of \\"any bumper sticker, sign or writing which depicts obscene language descriptive of sexual or excretory activities\\".Baker v.

The episode centers on a chain of events created by Walter's crossing over into the parallel universe in 1985 that has had subtle but significant effects in the present. Christopher Lloyd guest-starred as retired rocker Roscoe Joyce. As the first episode in its new Friday time slot, \\"The Firefly\\" aired on January 21, 2011 in the United States to 4.88 million viewers, outperforming the previous episode \\"Marionette\\" Thursday night viewership by 18%. Time shifted viewership added 42% in its ratings. It received generally positive reviews, with many praising the storyline as \\"elegant\\" and \\"beautiful.\\" Plot The Fringe team is brought to a nursing home, where Roscoe Joyce (Christopher Lloyd), the former keyboardist of the band Violet Sedan Chair, was seen talking to his son Bobby (Nick Ouellette) who had died in 1985, as well as evidence of an Observer. Walter Bishop (John Noble), meeting his musical hero, requests to take Roscoe back to his lab to help Roscoe remember what his son said. Walter is able to help Roscoe remember much of his past since the loss of his son through therapy that includes helping Roscoe to recall his piano-playing skills. Roscoe shortly recalls the conversation with his son, which was actually a message from the Observer September to Walter. September (Michael Cerveris) soon appears at the lab and requests to speak to Walter. As they walk, September reminds Walter of the damage he did when he brought Peter from the parallel universe. September recounts the events of one such chain: in the prime universe, three months after Walter's crossing, Peter (Joshua Jackson) captured a firefly which set into motion a chain of events that eventually led to the death of a pedestrian in a car accident (Walter brought over Peter, Peter caught a firefly, a little girl nearby didn't catch that same firefly, she wandered away, her father drove around looking for her, he hit the pedestrian). September mysteriously departs when Walter answers a telephone call, but not before leaving him with a message: \\"give him the keys and save the girl.\\" Later, Walter returns Roscoe to the nursing home. Roscoe thanks him and explains that the recent events reminded him of the last phone call he had with his son, where Bobby said he had dreamed of meeting Roscoe in a nursing home in the future. Roscoe is remorseful that Bobby died shortly after that call when a car struck him while crossing the street, which led to the breakup of the band. Because of the date and place of the accident, Walter realizes that Roscoe's son was the pedestrian previously mentioned by September. Unbeknownst to the Fringe team, September has engineered several events in the last few days, including stopping an armed robbery to help the asthmatic female employee (Olivia Cheng) recover from an asthma attack, taking her inhaler. When Walter hears of this witness, he requests Peter and Agent Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) to bring her to his lab, believing her to be related to the Observer's warning. Minutes from the lab, September rams the car in which the woman is being transported, initiating another asthma attack. September races from the scene, prompting Peter to follow him in Walter's car, requesting Walter to \\"give me the keys and save the girl.\\" Walter realizes that September has been orchestrating the events leading up to this point and urges Peter not to go, believing that following the advice of the Observer might lead to Peter's death. Walter eventually relents and returns to help the woman, creating a makeshift inhaler before emergency help arrives. Meanwhile, Peter and Olivia follow the Observer to a rooftop. Peter corners September, who says \\"It must be very difficult, being a father\\", before he shoots Peter with an energy blast that knocks him off his feet. Olivia arrives in time to give chase to the Observer but September disappears from an adjacent rooftop. While Walter and Agent Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole) ensure that the witness is safe at the hospital, Olivia takes Peter back to the lab. Peter, suffering from a headache, takes an aspirin and drinks out of what he believes to be an ordinary bottle of milk from the fridge. In reality, the milk contains a serum developed by Walter in order to help him recover his full mental function. However, the serum was incorrectly prepared, which causes Peter to begin convulsing. Over the phone, Walter directs Olivia to inject Peter with the correct compounds in order to save his life. Walter realizes that the serum would have killed him if he had consumed it, and that this was another step in the Observer's plot. Later that evening, September meets with another Observer, and identifies the fact that Walter was able to let Peter go, despite believing that he may not survive, and that when the time comes, they can expect Walter to do it again. In a side plot, Olivia and Peter attempt to reorganize their relationship after Olivia receives a book (If You Meet The Buddha On The Road, Kill Him! by Sheldon Kopp) from Peter that he had originally ordered for Olivia's doppelg√§nger from the parallel universe. Production Christopher Lloyd was cast for one episode as a musical hero of Walter's in \\"The Firefly\\". \\"The Firefly\\" was co-written by co-showrunners J.H. Wyman and Jeff Pinkner, while being directed by Supernatural veteran Charles Beeson. On October 20, 2010, TV Guide announced that Back to the Future star Christopher Lloyd had been cast in an upcoming episode as \\"Walter's musical hero\\". Noble explained Lloyd's role: \\"We all know how much Walter loves music, right? Well this fellow was one of his icons. He adored this man. So Walter gets to be a bit of a fanboy\\". Lloyd began shooting the episode in late October. Soon before the episode aired, Lloyd told reporters \\"I was very excited for this role. My character is going through an experience he never expected to happen to him, and he's adjusting to that.\\" Lloyd also added he felt welcomed in as a part of the ensemble cast. In a conference call interview with journalists, John Noble explained that \\"probably the best fun that I've had [on Fringe] was doing the stuff with Chris Lloyd, because it was two crazy old guys just trying desperately to communicate with each other. We had a lot of laughs. There was a common thread of trying to find the music again, because Chris' character had forgotten how to play the piano, so we go through this journey of bringing the music back to him, and [it's a] thrill to Walter. This happens all the way through this very complicated episode\\". The band name of Lloyd's character Roscoe Joyce, \\"Violet Sedan Chair,\\" is a fictional band that Walter Bishop had mentioned the previous season, in the episode Grey Matters. J.J. Abrams had also named-dropped the fictional band two years earlier in an issue of Wired for which he had guest-edited, alluding to the band's album, Seven Suns, recorded in the 1970s. Several months prior to the broadcast of \\"The Firefly\\", a number of vinyl records of Seven Suns were shipped to a select number of independent record stores across the United States, which have been discovered by some people. The album does contain twelve songs in the style of psychedelic and folk. The album itself has been briefly shown in the series. As with other Fringe episodes, Fox released a science lesson plan in collaboration with Science Olympiad for grade school children, focusing on the science seen in \\"The Firefly\\", with the intention of having \\"students learn about pharmacology and the interactions that occur between a living organism and chemicals that affect normal or abnormal biochemical functions.\\" Cultural references Walter explains that the red and blue sunglasses he uses in order to see Roscoe Joyce's aura were sent to him by his friend, Doctor Jacoby from Washington State. This is a reference to the television series Twin Peaks, set in Washington State where Doctor Lawrence Jacoby is the local psychiatrist who also owns a pair of the same sunglasses. Reviewers also contrasted the casting of Christopher Lloyd, better known for his role of the scientist \\"Doc\\" Brown from the Back to the Future trilogy which took place in 1985, to that of a character involved with time travel involving the year 1985. Some journalists have speculated that the episode's title was in reference to Joss Whedon's Firefly series, which while critically acclaimed was cancelled mid-season after being scheduled in the Friday night death slot. However, though \\"The Firefly\\" was the first Fringe episode to be first aired in the new Friday night slot, the producer had already selected the title of the episode prior to the Fox Network rescheduling. Reception =Ratings= In November 2010, Fox announced that Fringe was being moved to Friday nights as a part of the network's midseason overhaul, to air after the fourth season of their reality series Kitchen Nightmares. The move meant that Fringe would be airing against Supernatural, a show with a similar science fiction genre, though this competition did not begin until Fringes third Friday episode \\"Concentrate and Ask Again\\". Fox's popular reality series American Idol took Fringes timeslot, as it was shifted a day later to Wednesdays and Thursdays. Executive producer J.H. Wyman stated in an interview that they were excited and believed Friday nights are \\"open territory that can be conquered... [We believe] we can actually deliver like The X-Files did. ... I think we both agree it's a good opportunity\\". Wyman elaborated that the show's high DVR numbers proved that though fans were watching the show, they did not want to do so on Thursdays. Co-executive producer Jeff Pinkner felt that if the show \\"can build a fan base on and carve out some territory on Friday night, we can be there for years\\". The episode was originally going to air on January 28 until it was moved to a week earlier, on January 21 behind the season premiere of Kitchen Nightmares. \\"The Firefly\\" was the first Fringe episode to broadcast in its Friday slot, and many journalists considered the pending viewership numbers critical for the future of the show. The episode was the most watched show of the night, earning a 1.9/6 share or about 4.88 million viewers in the 18‚Äì49 age group. This figure was slightly higher than the average viewership for Fringe in the first half of the 2010-2011 television season, and 18% higher than the previous episode, \\"Marionette\\". When time shifted viewership over the following three days is considered, the episode received a 42% ratings increase with a 2.7 rating share, and within 7 days after its airing, reported a total of 6.7 million viewers with 2.8 rating, representing a 37% increase from the live broadcast. Fringe and its lead-in show, Kitchen Nightmares, resulted in Fox's highest rated Friday night with entertainment programs since 2008. =Reviews= \\"The Firefly\\" was well received by critics who considered the episode to be backed by a strong script. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly considered \\"The Firefly\\" as one of the series' \\"finest episodes\\", calling on the show's many qualities: The A.V. Club's Zack Handlen rated the episode an \\"A\\" in considering the \\"elegance\\" of the complicated Rube Goldberg- like plot, and praised the \\"beautiful, beautiful writing\\" in the reveal of the connection between Walter's actions and Roscoe's loss. Times James Poniewozik also enjoyed the elegant plot, calling the episode \\"an impressive outing for the series to welcome back its fans with\\"; Poniewozik also appreciated John Noble's performance as he \\"made Walter's regret, and the toll it has taken, real‚Äîwhile also pulling off an amusing turn as an overawed, elderly rock fanboy\\". Andrew Hanson of the Los Angeles Times, though somewhat confused to the cause-and-effect of the Observer's plot, he still found the show enjoyable, and called it \\"the Fringe version of the butterfly effect\\", a trope often used in other shows to show the impact of small changes in the characters' lives. IGN's Ramsey Isler gave the episode a rating of 7.5/10, stating that was \\"an important part of the setup for the second half of the season\\" with strong character development, but felt the pacing was slow and needed more action. Television Without Pity graded the episode a \\"B+\\". The A.V. Club staff highlighted the episode in their review of the best television shows of 2011. =Awards and nomination= At the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards, John Noble submitted \\"The Firefly\\", along with \\"Entrada\\" and \\"The Day We Died\\", for consideration in the Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series category, but did not receive a nomination.

Early life Born in Trinidad in 1950, Butt spent his early life in Walton-on-Thames, England, and attended boarding school at Stonyhurst College before becoming a hippie and traveling to Pakistan. Conversion to Islam and life in Pakistan Arriving in Swat in 1969, he was impressed by the tribal way of life and (unlike most of his fellow hippies) settled in the area, learning Pashto and Dari (he speaks a total of seven languages). He converted to Islam in 1970. He studied for eight years at Darul Uloom Deoband in India, graduating in 1984, the only Westerner to do so since its foundation in 1866. In Deoband, he studied under the scholars like Saeed Ahmad Palanpuri.Although he continued to live mainly in Swat, he began spending part of each year as the Muslim chaplain at Cambridge University. He left Swat in 2010 when his house was washed away by floods. Broadcasting career In 1993 he worked with the BBC World Service to create a new Pashto and Dari radio soap opera. Loosely based upon the format of The Archers, BBC Radio 4's long-running series, New Home New Life became so popular that it has been credited with influencing the Taliban not to press ahead with plans to outlaw radio. When the Taliban began to gain influence in Afghanistan and Pakistan, he saw their radical interpretation of Islam to be in conflict with the traditional Islamic tolerance of tribal culture. In response, he established the Pak/Afghan Cross-border Radio Training and Production (Pact) project in 2004, producing the Across the Border programme to confront what he saw as Islamic extremism. He has continued to promote what he sees as 'mainstream' Islam, and has been among those pressing ahead with plans for a new Islamic university in Jalalabad, offering a moderate alternative to radical clerics: > It makes perfect sense.

Laurel and Williamstown, New Jersey that began in 2008. Since then, they had released two EPs, an acoustic EP, a split with Boston pop punk band Transit, a compilation and four full-length albums. Taking influence from such pop punk acts as Blink-182, Saves the Day, and Taking Back Sunday, Man Overboard played a brand of upbeat and poppy pop punk with the emotion of 90s emo acts such as The Promise Ring. The band was signed to Rise Records. They are well known for their motto within the pop punk scene to \\"Defend Pop Punk\\". On January 28, 2016 they announced a hiatus on their official website; the hiatus ended on August 2, 2018 when the band announced a 10-year anniversary tour.  History  =Formation and EPs (2008‚Äì09)= Man Overboard was formed by childhood friends, Nik Bruzzese and Wayne Wildrik, when they began writing songs together at Nik's Small Hill Studio. The band's name was inspired by the Blink-182 song of the same name. Wildrick then invited Zac Eisenstein, who at the time was vocalist of the band The Front Page which Wildrick was also a member of, to sing and play guitar. Justin Mondschein from the band Bangarang! was asked to play drums but after he and a revolving door of other drummers left, Justin Collier (another member of The Front Page) took over drums full- time. The core line-up of the band was then completed. They entered the studio in 2008 to record their debut EP, Hung Up on Nothing. The band then went on a nationwide tour to promote the EP. From mid-August to early October 2009, the band supported Fireworks on their headlining tour of the US. In November, they signed with Run for Cover Records where they released a three-song digital EP entitled, Dahlia, which was produced by Jesse Cannon. This was followed by a split with Transit, in December 2009. =Rise Records and self-titled album (2010‚Äì12)= Man Overboard in 2011 In 2010, the 10 track compilation entitled, Before We Met: A Collection of Old Songs, featuring songs from Hung Up on Nothing was released on Panic Records in February. The band then released an acoustic EP on Run for Cover, Noise from Upstairs in March. But perhaps their most acclaimed work to date was their debut album, Real Talk. Released on CD, vinyl and digital format on July 20 on Run for Cover Records. The album picked up a favorable review from Absolute Punk who called it \\"the pop punk album of the summer\\", AMP calling it \\"A 5 star, 10 out of 10 release. A must pick up listen in every respect\\" and Australian website Killyourstereo calling it \\"the best pop punk album of 2010\\" and rating it 98 out of 100. On the back of Real Talk, Man Overboard have toured the US with such bands as The Wonder Years, The Swellers, Fireworks and Transit and Europe with Senses Fail, The Ghost Inside, Transit, All Time Low and All or Nothing. Founding member and guitarist Wayne Wildrick left the band in August 2010 due to personal reasons. Then-drummer Justin Collier replaced Wildrick on guitar and Mike Hrycenko (who was also in The Front Page) joined on drums. In December 2010, Man Overboard signed with Rise Records and announced they will release their sophomore full- length with Rise as well as Run for Cover in 2011. Prior to releasing the album, the band will put out another compilation LP on Run for Cover entitled The Human Highlight Reel, that features Dahlia, Noise from Upstairs, Real Talk B-Sides, a \\"Promise Ring\\" cover and two brand new songs as well as a new 7 entitled The Absolute Worst on Rise on February 22, 2011. \\"The Absolute Worst\\" was made available for streaming via the band's Facebook page. \\"Driveway\\" made available for download on April 7. In April 2011, Wayne Wildrick rejoined the band and stated that his reason for his departure in 2010 was due to anxiety. He will play his first performance back at Bamboozle and Man Overboard will continue as a 5 piece. In August 2011, they announced that their new album would be self-titled and will be released on Rise Records on September 27. They also released the track listing and album artwork. It was confirmed in July 2011 that the band was added to the opening act of the Pop Punks Not Dead Tour this fall headlined by New Found Glory. Other opening acts include Set Your Goals, The Wonder Years, and This Time Next Year. In December 2011, Man Overboard acted as direct support for emo band The Early November on several of their reunion shows in the Eastern United States. For the first half of 2012, Man Overboard will be touring the United States and Europe, with many different bands, including Trapped Under Ice, Daytrader, The Story So Far, Save Your Breath, and Handguns. On January 4, 2012, it was confirmed that the band will be playing all of the 2012 Vans Warped Tour.

The band spent autumn of 2012 touring the east coast with pop-punk band Major League, touring the west coast with Taking Back Sunday and Bayside and touring the UK with New Found Glory for Warped UK. =Heart Attack (2012‚Äì14)= It was announced as a surprise in late February that, over winter, the band had recorded an entire new album. This announcement followed the notion that Man Overboard, commonly recognised as \\"particularly frequent\\" with releasing music for their fans, had been relatively quiet for the past year. Man Overboard announced the release date of their third studio album entitled Heart Attack, the album would set to be released on May 28, 2013. The band released its first song off the album, \\"White Lies,\\" on March 12 through Rise Records' YouTube channel.

The trio, made up of photographer/musician Barbara Ess, visual artist Virginia Piersol, and filmmaker Gail Vachon, developed a unique sound via their acoustic toy instrumentation of toy piano, ukulele and a paper-headed Mickey Mouse drum kit, augmented by electric bass guitar, Casio keyboards and various low-tech effects. Y Pants' feminist poetics and toy instrumentation made them a hit in Manhattans's art gallery scene, while their No Wave clout brought them to be regulars at punk rock venues like CBGB's. In 1980, Glenn Branca recorded their debut 4-song EP for 99 Records, followed by a LP two years later.

It is a concept developed by Professor Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his book, Antifragile, and in technical papers., As Taleb explains in his book, antifragility is fundamentally different from the concepts of resiliency (i.e. the ability to recover from failure) and robustness (that is, the ability to resist failure). The concept has been applied in risk analysis, physics,Naji, A., Ghodrat, M., Komaie-Moghaddam, H., & Podgornik, R. (2014).

In SICE Annual Conference (SICE), 2014 Proceedings of the (pp. 2031-2036). IEEE. Taleb defines it as follows in a letter to Nature responding to an earlier review of his book in that journal:  Antifragile versus robust/resilient  In his book, Taleb stresses the differences between antifragile and robust/resilient. \\"Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better.\\" The concept has now been applied to ecosystems in a rigorous way. In their work, the authors review the concept of ecosystem resilience in its relation to ecosystem integrity from an information theory approach. This work reformulates and builds upon the concept of resilience in a way that is mathematically conveyed and can be heuristically evaluated in real-world applications: for example, ecosystem antifragility. The authors also propose that for socio-ecosystem governance, planning or in general, any decision making perspective, antifragility might be a valuable and more desirable goal to achieve than a resilience aspiration. In the same way, Pineda and co- workers has proposed a simply calculable measure of antifragility, based on the change of ‚Äúsatisfaction‚Äù (i.e network complexity) before and after adding perturbations, and apply it to random Boolean networks (RBNs). They also show that several well known biological networks such as Arabidopsis thaliana cell- cycle are as expected antifragile.  Antifragile versus adaptive/cognitive  An adaptive system is one that changes its behavior based on information available at time of utilization (as opposed to having the behavior defined during system design). This characteristic is sometimes referred to as cognitive. While adaptive systems allow for robustness under a variety of scenarios (often unknown during system design), they are not necessarily antifragile. In other words, the difference between antifragile and adaptive is the difference between a system that is robust under volatile environments/conditions, and one that is robust in a previously unknown environment.  Mathematical heuristic  Taleb proposed a simple heuristic for detecting fragility. If f(a) is some model of a, then fragility exists when H<0, robustness exists when H=0, and antifragility exists when H>0, where H = \\\\frac{f(a-\\\\Delta)+f(a+\\\\Delta)}{2}-f(a). In short, the heuristic is to adjust a model input higher and lower. If the average outcome of the model after the adjustments is significantly worse than the model baseline, then the model is fragile with respect to that input.  Applications  The concept has been applied in physics, risk analysis, molecular biology, transportation planning, urban planning, engineering, aerospace (NASA), megaproject management, and computer science. In computer science, there is a structured proposal for an \\"Antifragile Software Manifesto\\", to react to traditional system designs. The major idea is to develop antifragility by design, building a system which improves from environment's input.

Early life  Stanley was born in Iota, Acadia Parish, Louisiana in the year 1903. He then moved as a child to California and spent his youth there in the city of Watsonville. Upon graduation from high school Stanley proceeded to study sculpture at Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles from 1923 to 1926. He also taught at this school from 1926 to 1942. Stanley also taught briefly at the Santa Barbara School of the Arts. During his life he completed many public arts works including work for schools such as the Long Beach Polytechnic High School, as well as works for private patrons.  Sculpting career  The Oscar statuette was fabricated based upon a sketch by MGM art director Cedric Gibbons in 1927. Since then, more than 2,300 statuettes have been presented to some of the world's best film and television actors, writers, directors, producers, and technicians. Stanley sculpted a statue of Sir Isaac Newton located at the Griffith Observatory, completed in 1934. This statue was part of a larger work known as the Astronomer's Monument. This work was a public project funded by the PWAP. Consequently, the work was signed \\"PWAP\\", with none of the six artists contributing to it receiving individual recognition. The design for the monument was submitted by Archibald Garner, and executed by him and five of the other sculptors who had submitted proposals. Stanley designed the Oscar award based on an original sketch by Cedric Gibbons. It was first awarded in 1929. Stanley sculpted the Muse of Music, Dance, Drama located at the Hollywood Bowl which serves as the gateway to Hollywood. Completed in 1940, this fountain sculpture in the Streamline Moderne style is carved from granite and stands twenty-two feet tall and two-hundred feet wide. It serves as a retaining wall for the amphitheater. In June 2006, the sculpture was refurbished and rededicated. It received new plumbing, landscaping and grout.

Biography Zasulich was a graduate of the Cadet Corps and the Konstantinovskoe Military Academy and was commissioned as a lieutenant in 1863, serving with the 93rd Infantry Regiment in Irkutsk. He transferred to the Grenadier Regiment of the Life Guards in 1864. He was with this regiment during the Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878), during which he was highly decorated several times for bravery in combat in the Balkans, especially during the Battle of Philippopolis (1878). He was also promoted to colonel in 1878. In 1887, Zasulich was assigned command of the 101st Infantry Regiment based at Perm. He was promoted to Major General in 1894 and made commander of the 1st Brigade of the 9th Infantry Division, followed by the 1st Brigade of the 2nd Grenadier Division. In 1899, he took command of Osowiec Fortress in what is now Poland. The following year, he became commander of the 6th Infantry Division, and was promoted to Lieutenant General in 1901. Immediately before the start of the Russo-Japanese War, Zasulich was given command of the 2nd Siberian Army Corps, with 16,000 infantry, 5,000 cavalry, and 62 artillery pieces, which formed the eastern wing of the Russian Manchurian Army. Assigned to prevent the Imperial Japanese Army from crossing the Yalu River into Manchuria, he made the tactical error of spreading his forces piecemeal over a 170-mile front and heavily fortifying the border of town of Antung, where he was convinced the main attack would come. Assuming that the Japanese army amassing near Wiju upstream from Antung was a feint, he refused requests to redeploy his forces. In the subsequent Battle of Yalu River, the Russian forces were routed by Japanese First Army under General Kuroki Tamemoto. Zasulich, who had a very low opinion of the Japanese, initially refused General Kuropatkin's orders to make a phased withdrawal, but as the Japanese army began to completely overwhelm his forces, he had no choice but to make a costly retreat to the north. Zasulich was replaced as field commander by Lieutenant General Fyodor Keller, but retained command of the Second Siberian Army Corps.Kowner, Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War, p. 434. Zasulich subsequently participated in other battles of the war, including the Battle of Tashihchiao, Battle of Hsimucheng, and Battle of Liaoyang as well as the Battle of Mukden; however, as his actions were marked by indecisiveness and passivity, causing his forces to suffer one defeat after another. His refusal to go on the offensive and continual retreats made him unpopular with his troops, at the Battle of Liaoyang, his refusal to obey Lieutenant General Nikolai Zarubaev‚Äôs orders to hold his position endangered the entire Russian position.Kowner, p. 438.

The Australian Police team played two games against Argentina. The first was a 40-4 win for the Australian Police, with a crowd of around 150 attending. The second game was a 60‚Äì6 win for the Australian Police with a crowd attendance of around 300. The sport then remained dormant in the country for over 10 years before being revived in 2016 amidst a number of other South and Central American nations taking up the sport. Argentina saw its first domestic activity for a decade in November 2016 when it hosted the Primer Torneo Sudamericano de Rugby League, a slightly modified 9-a-side tournament in Miramar involving the national teams of Argentina and Chile, as well as a number of select sides from around the region which were bolstered by the Latin Heat organization. The final of the event was between the Argentinian and Chilean national teams, with Argentina winning 16-0. In 2017, with great effort from the players and coaching staff, Argentina traveled to Chile by bus, to be in the inaugural Latinoamericano Championship. This was the first time that a Latin American championship was played with 13 players a side, three referees and full RLIF tournament rules. This event gave Argentina their first chance to earn World Ranking points and debut in the International Rankings. Argentina's first match of the tournament was a 36-6 win over Colombia. This win earned a spot in the Final against Chile with Argentina losing 32-12 to a team sporting a number of heritage players from Australia. The Argentinian team for the tournament was wholly made up of players from development and social leagues and no heritage players. 2018 saw Argentina playing in the Confedera√ß√£o Brasileira de Rugby League Festival in Sao Paulo, beating Colombia 28-16 before losing to Brazil in the final by 22-20 despite leading 14-20 at one point. Nowadays, the national team struggles to survive trying to add players, open some local competition and arrange some international friendlies with the typical economic issues of an amateur sport in the country.

He plays at scrum-half in the team and is the most-capped scrum-half to ever play for New Zealand. Smith played for the MƒÅori All Blacks in 2010, and was first selected for the All Blacks in 2012. He was a key member of the 2015 Rugby World Cup winning team. He also plays for the Highlanders in Super Rugby where he is the club's all time leader in caps, and for Manawatu in the ITM Cup. Playing career =Provincial rugby= Smith made his debut for Manawatu in the 2008 Air New Zealand Cup at the age of 19, making several substitute appearances for the Turbos. This included the historic 25‚Äì24 win over Canterbury in Round 1 and the 38‚Äì38 draw with Waikato in Round 3. For the 2009 Air New Zealand Cup, Smith established himself as the first-choice half-back for Manawatu, starting all 13 games over the course of the season and scoring his first representative try. He continued as the starter in the 2010 ITM Cup, and established himself as one of the top half-backs in the competition and earning a Super Rugby contract. In the 2011 ITM Cup, Smith continued to improve and had a successful season, scoring five tries helping the improved Manawatu squad which reached the Championship final. =Super Rugby= Aaron Smith playing for the Highlanders Smith was included in the Blues wider training group for the 2010 Super 14 season, but did not see any game action for the Auckland-based side. For the 2011 Super Rugby season, Smith signed for the Highlanders, coached by Jamie Joseph, who had previously coached Smith with the New Zealand MƒÅori. Smith had a successful debut season, beating out Sean Romans for the job as backup to starting half-back (and All Black) Jimmy Cowan, and made 12 appearances including 3 starts. =International career= On the back of his strong performances for Manawatu, Smith, of NgƒÅti Kahungunu descent, was selected to the New Zealand MƒÅori for their 2010 Centenary Series. He came on as a substitute against the New Zealand Barbarians after Chris Smylie suffered a fractured cheekbone, and started in the squad's historic victories over Ireland and England. On the back of a successful Highlanders season Smith made his All Blacks debut on 9 June 2012, against Ireland. By the time of the 2013 season Smith had become the first choice halfback for the national team. Smith has been selected for every New Zealand squad since 2013, including the 2015 Rugby World Cup squad where he started in all the knockout games. Smith became the leader of the All Blacks' haka in 2016, following the retirement of Keven Mealamu and Liam Messam's decision to swap to New Zealand's rugby 7s squad, first leading the Haka against Wales at Eden Park. Smith played his 50th international test match in the final test against Wales, during the 2016 tour, alongside lock Brodie Retallick, with whom he debuted. Although Smith lost his place as the All Blacks' Haka leader later in the season due to off-field controversy, as well as strong competition for a starting place, from TJ Perenara, Smith was retained as a regular starter into the 2017 season, when he started in all three tests against the touring British and Irish Lions. Smith became the most-capped scrum-half in New Zealand's history in the 2018 season, breaking Justin Marshall's long-standing record on 17 November 2018. Despite the ongoing competition for his starting place through TJ Perenara, Smith was chosen to start against Ireland. Smith, during his record-breaking performance, unfortunately failed to perform well, with the All Blacks losing 9-16.

It is one of the oldest university outing clubs in the United States. Founded in 1907, the Society of Les Voyageurs is the second oldest student organization on the University of Michigan campus. On Sunday evenings during the academic year, the Society hosts communal dinners known as \\"Sunday Feeds\\" along with educational programs and entertainment related to the outdoors. History The Society of Les Voyageurs was founded in 1907 by University of Michigan students Elmer \\"Lindy\\" Lehndorff, Lawrence \\"Larry\\" Lark, and Chester MacChesney. They named the Society after the pioneering French-Canadian voyageurs of the Great Lakes fur trade, whom they admired as early adventurers and outdoorsmen. Society membership was initially open only to male students at the University. The Society's Constitution was amended in 1972 to allow for the admission of women, and the Society has been co-ed since that time. The Society has published an annual yearbook since 1910 as well as several volumes of Society history. After nearly two decades of renting space on the University of Michigan campus, the Society drew up plans in 1924 to construct a cabin on several acres of property along the Huron River in Ann Arbor. \\"Pine Lodge\\", as it was originally named, was built almost entirely by Society members in the spring and summer of 1925, and has continually served since then as the home for the Society as well as a residence for student members. During the summer of 2012, the renamed Habe Mills Pine Lodge underwent an extensive renovation, including the installation of \\"Kay's Kitchen.\\" The new kitchen is named for Kay Lane, a University student in the late 1960s and early 1970s upon whom Society members bestowed the title \\"Queen of the Cabin,\\" and who ultimately paved the way for the admission of women as full members of the Society. After graduating from the University of Michigan, Kay remained active in the Society and was a well known friend and mentor to several generations of members. 2012 Cabin Renovation Beginning in the summer of 2012, the cabin underwent a major renovation costing over $100,000. Plans for the renovation had been tossed around for years, and the final plans were made official in early January of that year. Most of the work was contracted out to by the River Carpentry, but many of the actives and alumni were around and gave a helping hand. The renovation consisted of expanding the dining room, adding an upstairs bathroom, re-doing the kitchen, adding in a hallway between the dining room and kitchen and expanding the upstairs lodge. The work was completed in August 2012, and was ready to welcome back students for the 2012 Fall semester. Potlucks continue as normal, but now there is more space to accommodate even more lovely guests.

The Fortified Sector of Mulhouse (Secteur Fortifi√© de Mulhouse) was the French military organization that in 1940 controlled the section of the French frontier with Germany in the vicinity of Mulhouse. The sector's principal defense was the Rhine itself, which could be crossed only by boat or by seizing a bridge crossing. The sector's fortifications chiefly took the form of casemates and blockhouses. The sector did not see significant action during the Battle of France, since the German crossings of the Rhine took place further north, near Colmar. The fortifications in the sector were built as part of the overall plan for the Maginot Line, but did not include the major fortified positions that characterized the Maginot Line of northeastern France. The sector did not see significant fighting in World War II. It was bordered to the north by the Fortified Sector of Colmar and on the south by the Fortified Sector of Altkirch. Concept and organization Casemate de Bantzenheim The fortifications of the Mulhouse sector were laid out in two major lines, one right on the Rhine, and another to the rear on the eastern edge of the Hardt forest. No fortifications were established south of Hombourg, owing to the provisions of the 1815 Congress of Vienna treaty, which forbade permanent fortifications within of Basel. Two positions were placed between the front and rear lines, and were considered a second line. The fortifications consisted entirely of casemates and blockhouses, constructed by the Commission d'Organisation des R√©gions Fortifi√©es (CORF), CORF was responsible for the major fortifications of the Maginot Line, but in this area no major positions or ouvrages were built. The Hardt forest was regarded as a significant obstacle between the third line and Mulhouse.Mary, Tome 3, p. 149 The riverbank fortifications were of a basic nature, with protection only up to 155mm caliber, machine gun armament and no electrical system. The second and third lines were more robust in construction and equipment, with electric generators and anti-tank weapons.Kauffmann, p. 76 The heaviest concentration of fortifications were in the area of Neuf-Brisach, itself a preserved fortress from the Vauban era. Neuf-Brisach guarded a strategic bridge across the Rhine. Insignia of the 10th RIF. Command The Mulhouse sector was under the overall command of the French 8th Army, which was in turn under the French 3rd Army Group. The SF Mulhouse was commanded by General Didio, with a command post at Rixheim. The fortifications were manned by the 10th Fortress Infantry Regiment. The interval troops, the army formations that were to provide the mobile defense for the sector, to support and be supported by the fixed defenses, were under the command of the 13th Corps (13e Corps d'Armee), General Misserey, commander. Artillery support for the sector was provided by the 159th Position Artillery Regiment (R√©giment d'Artillerie de Position (RAP)). From 16 March 1940 the SF Mulhouse was designated the 105th Fortress Infantry Division, or \\"Mulhouse Division.\\" At the midpoint of the Battle of France on 1 June 1940, the fortress troops of the 105th DIF amounted to one fortress infantry regiment (10th RIF) in three battalions, comprising 135 officers and 4,500 men.Mary, Tome 3, p. 189 Description The sector includes, in order from north to south, the following significant casemates and infantry shelters (abris) in each sub-sector: =Sub-sector of Schliebach= 10th Fortress Infantry Regiment (10e R√©giment d'Infanterie de Forteresse (RIF)), Lt.

The offensive, launched on 15 June, was rendered unimportant when the German XIX Corps under General Heinz Guderian reached the Swiss border on 17 June, behind the main French line.Mary, Tome 3, p. 200 The riverside positions were evacuated on 16 June, with a general withdrawal of the 105th DIF into the Vosges on 18 June, regrouping in the Markstein area. An attempt was made to defend Kruth, but were dislodged with many captured by the Germans. Remnants fell back to the Col de Stiftkopf on the 22nd, then the Rouge-Gazon farm where they were finally captured on 26 June.Mary, Tome 1, p. 88 = Units = The 10th Fortress Infantry Regiment was the principal operational unit in the SF Mulhouse, and its operations in June mirrored those of its parent unit, the 105th DIF. Present situation Most of the Rhine defenses were simply abandoned after World War II. Most of the first line of blockhouses on the banks of the river were destroyed when the river was widened as part of navigational improvements in the 1970s.Romanych, Rupp, p. 93 References  Bibliography  *Allcorn, William.

The name is attributed to the location of a fishing weir in the stream. The river gives its name to a larger watershed and Weir River Farm, a park and nature reserve owned by The Trustees of Reservations. Description Weir River is formed at the confluence of Crooked Meadow River and Fulling Mill Brook in Hingham near the intersection of Free Street and Massachusetts Route 228 which are fed by Cushing Pond, Fulling Mill Pond, and the wetlands around Jacob's Meadow. The river flows north through Hingham and is joined by Tower Brook and Accord Brook in its first mile (1.6 km), then gradually turns northeast and travels another before being dammed to form Foundry Pond. The dam marks the southern boundary of the estuary, which is one of 30 areas designated by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as an Area of Critical Environmental Concern. The estuary is split in two segments and extends over both east and north, forming the border between Hingham and the town of Hull to the north. On the west side of Weir River estuary lies World's End, another Trustees of Reservations park. The estuary reaches Hingham Bay at the north side of the World's End peninsula. In 2005, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts designated the Weir River Watershed as \\"high stressed\\", meaning the rate of dewatering, from seasonal low precipitation and water supply withdrawals, exceeds the rate of recharge, from natural rainfall, for extended periods during the year. The Weir River Watershed Association is the non-profit organization charged with stewardship of the Weir River.

She previously served as Chairman of the Board of Lake County, Illinois from 2000 to 2010. Education and Early Life Schmidt grew up in the Chicago area and attended Lyons Township High School and later earned a bachelor's degree from Southern Illinois University in 1974. Schmidt worked as an art teacher in Fox Lake from 1974 to 1987 and served as the State Director for the Illinois Lakes Management Association from 1983 to 1985. She was elected to the Lake Villa Township Board in 1985.  County Board Chairman  Schmidt was elected to the Lake County Board (Illinois) in 1988, representing the communities of Lake Villa and Lindenhurst. In 1988 she also became the Commissioner of the Lake County Forest Preserve, a position she held from 1988 to 2010 where she became a staunch advocate for open lands, public space and the preservation of natural resources. She was elected as Chairman of the Lake County Board in 2000, replacing incumbent Jim LaBelle. Schmidt was the first female Chairman of Lake County, elected for an unprecedented 5 terms, and is noted for presiding over a decade during which the County Board consistently passed balanced budgets and maintained AAA bond rating. In her tenure on the County Board, Schmidt also served as Chairman of the Lake County Liquor Commission and supported the extension of Route 53. Schmidt as served as Metro County Board Chairman from 2004 to 2010 and worked with the collar counties on issues facing county government, securing the Regional Transportation Authority (RTA) sales tax funding that was imperative to the sustainability of the RTA, Lake County, and the Metro County Region. As Chairman, she cracked down on violations of ordinances and worked to amend the adult use ordinance in 1998 to make it stricter. Schmidt resigned from the County Board in January 2011 to assume her new position as an Illinois State Senator. Illinois Senate =Election= Schmidt was elected in 2010 after defeating Democratic incumbent Michael Bond with just over 53% of the popular vote. =Tenure= Shortly after taking office, Schmidt joined with other Senate Republicans in proposing a plan which would introduce more than $5 billion in reductions to government spending intended to \\"maintain core government services and also [prevent an] income tax increase\\". Schmidt sponsored an amendment to the Deposit of State Moneys Act which places restrictions on the Illinois Treasurer's power to invest state funds. The bill passed both Houses of the Illinois General Assembly and was sent to the office of the Governor. She also acted as the chief Senate sponsor of a bill which authorizes law enforcement agencies to collect pharmaceuticals for safe disposal. Schmidt also supported the safe and scheduled removal of spent fuel rods housed at a de-commissioned nuclear plant in Zion, Illinois, and for the lands to be returned to the public, \\"I want to see this area go back to what it was --- open to the public for recreation. There is a beautiful shoreline here everyone should be able to enjoy.\\" Schmidt was a co-sponsor to legislation which would have allowed the practice of concealed carry in Illinois. She also co-sponsored a bipartisan resolution introduced by Democratic Senator Kwame Raoul which would amended the Illinois Constitution to consolidate the positions of State Treasurer and State Comptroller. In 2011 Schmidt was appointed to the Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability, which provides the Legislature with research and information regarding state and national economies, revenue projections and operations of Illinois Government. She was also appointed to the Illinois Council on Aging during her first year in office. In September 2011, the Illinois Environmental Council, a state environmental advocacy group, awarded Schmidt the Environmental Leadership Award for her work with the Lake County Forest Preserve. =Committee Assignments= Schmidt was appointed Minority Spokesperson of the Local Government Committee during the 97th session of the Illinois General Assembly. She served on the following six committees: * Appropriations II Committee * Commerce Committee * Education Committee * Financial Institutions Committee * Local Government Committee (Minority Spokesperson) * Subcommittee on Annexation Personal life Schmidt and her husband Bob were married in 1980 and currently reside in Lake Villa, Illinois. On August 16, 2011, police were called to the Schmidt home by Bob Schmidt regarding a domestic dispute. Police did not release further details on the ongoing investigation of what they called a \\"verbal argument.\\" As of August 19, 2011, no further details had been released regarding the verbal argument., \\"'Verbal argument' brings deputies to state senator's home,\\" Chicago Tribune. 19 Aug 2011. The police were again called to the Schmidt home twice in September 2011. The last 911 call made on September 26 was recorded, and has led to implications that Schmidt may have intended to use her political position to influence Lake County authorities against intervening in the matter. Schmidt later issued a press release to deny that this was her intent and apologize for the inappropriateness of the comments., \\"Lake GOP leader says it‚Äôs premature to talk about replacing Schmidt in Senate\\" Daily Herald. 1 Oct 2011. Robert Schmidt consistently conveyed to the media that he considered the affair to be a private matter and did not wish to comment further., \\"Did state senator wield clout in marital tiff?\\" Chicago Tribune. 29 Sep 2011. Schmidt was arrested by Lake County Sheriff‚Äôs deputies in the early evening of June 12, 2012 on a misdemeanor warrant alleging that she damaged her neighbor‚Äôs property and trespassed, both stemming from a dispute with her neighbor.

Maple (1920‚Äì2001) was a private in the United States Army in World War II who helped two German prisoners of war escape in 1943. They were recaptured, and Maple was sentenced to death by hanging. He was the first American soldier ever convicted of a crime equivalent to treason. However, his sentence was first commuted to life imprisonment and later to ten years. Early life and education Maple was born in San Diego, California in 1920. His working class parents were of English and Irish extraction. Maple graduated first in his class of 585 from San Diego High School at the age of sixteen and won a scholarship to Harvard University. In 1941, he received a bachelor's degree in comparative philology magna cum laude, specializing in German, from Harvard and was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. An FBI agent later described him as \\"one of the most intelligent men I have ever had the opportunity to interview\\". However, he was pressured into resigning from the university German Club for singing the \\"Horst-Wessel-Lied\\" and other Nazi songs. When he told The Crimson student newspaper that \\"even a bad dictatorship is better than a good democracy\\", he was also dismissed from the campus Reserve Officers' Training Corps. Aiding the enemy As a result of his pro-German activities, when Maple enlisted in February 1942, both the Army and the FBI kept files on him. He was assigned, along with others under suspicion, to the 620th Engineer General Service Company, one of only a handful of units not allowed to bear arms. On December 5, 1943, a detachment of the company was assigned to guard prisoners of war at Camp Hale in Colorado. Fraternization between guards and prisoners was noticed (and resented) by ski troopers of the 10th Mountain Division who were training there; many of the division's ski instructors were Austrian emigres. Maple and three others in the 620th plotted an escape. Maple purchased a 1934 REO sedan and, on February 15, 1944, picked up Afrika Korps Sergeants Heinrich Kikillus and Erhard Schwichtenberg from a work detail without attracting attention. After 36 hours of driving, they were within of the Mexican border when they ran out of gas. The trio walked into Mexico, where they were arrested by a Mexican customs official and turned over to American authorities. Maple was jailed in Albuquerque, New Mexico and originally charged with treason. The Army convened a court martial and charged Maple instead under the 81st Article of War for \\"relieving, corresponding with or aiding the enemy\\", the \\"closest equivalent to the charge of treason\\". He pleaded innocent. His defense was that it was all a ruse intended only to bring attention to the existence of U.S. Army \\"Special Organizations\\" which had been established in World War II. These units held soldiers suspected of being disloyal to the United States. He was found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging. However, the Army Judge Advocate General recommended to President Franklin D. Roosevelt that his life be spared. Roosevelt commuted Maple's sentence to life imprisonment. After the war, in 1946, the sentence was further reduced to ten years. He was released in February 1951.

Joppa is part of the Morristown, Tennessee Metropolitan Statistical Area, and also a component of the Knoxville-Morristown-Sevierville Combined Statistical Area. History Joppa is situated along the Federal Road (U.S. Route 11W - Rutledge Pike), formerly known as the Old Lee Highway, which connected New Orleans and Washington, D.C. The road intersected the Old Kentucky Road (now U.S. Route 25E - Dixie Highway) at Bean Station, northeast of Joppa.Kevin Collins, Grainger County. The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2002. Retrieved: February 19, 2008. Jeremiah Jarnagin One of the first deeds registered in Grainger County was from Capt. Thomas Jarnagin to Major and Lavinia Jarnagin Lea, on August 6, 1796, for 375 acres. Jeremiah Jarnagin was the son of Capt. Thomas Jarnagin, friend of John Sevier, and fought in the Indian and Revolutionary Wars. Capt. Jarnagin purchased a land grant covering the area from present-day Joppa School to Blaine along Highway 11W, most of which he gave to his children. Capt. Jarnagin came and helped his son-in-law, Major Lea, build the Lea-Fox House in the early 1790s, and may have helped his son Noah build the Hickle House near Joppa School in 1794. Noah's wife, Mary Russell Jarnagin, was the niece of Lydia Russell Bean, wife of William Bean, the first white settler in Tennessee. Noah lived here until his death in 1849. The Hickle House was also used as a tavern at one time. Jeremiah Jarnagin established his household in Grainger County in 1802. He acquired adjoining land to the extent that his boundary contained more than 1,600 acres. Jeremiah operated the Red House Tavern. This tavern got its name simply because it was painted red, probably the only painted structure for many miles. Andrew Jackson, seventh president of the United States, spent time at this tavern. Jeremiah was a man of much strength. In the closing days of the Civil War, when a soldier seeking to enter his cellar and carry away his provisions, although bearing the weight of 80 years upon his shoulders, with his strong right arm he quickly felled the soldier to the floor. So impressed was the commanding officer that he ordered his soldiers to ride away. American Civil War Early during the American Civil War, Confederate cannons were mounted at the Powder Spring Gap on Clinch Mountain facing the Clinch Valley in order to prevent Union forces crossing from the northwest side of the ridge to the Federal Road and the Richland Valley to the southeast. As the war progressed, Confederate soldiers engaged in guerrilla warfare tactics from numerous vantage points along Clinch Mountain, including the rocks and caves around Joppa Mountain's summit at Buzzard Rock where they extracted saltpeter, one of the ingredients of gunpowder, from the droppings of buzzards. This guerrilla warfare largely paralyzed Grainger County during the war. Confederate General James Longstreet, who had earlier failed to wrest Knoxville from Union forces, on December 14, 1863, in what became known as the Battle of Bean's Station, attacked a Union detachment that had been pursuing him. The Confederates failed to exploit the element of surprise, and the Union forces were able to hold out until reinforcements arrived. While Longstreet was victorious, Union forces were able to retreat through Joppa en route to fortifications at Blaine, and Longstreet subsequently abandoned the assault and continued his retreat from Knoxville eastward to winter quarters at Russellville. He rejoined the Army of Northern Virginia the following spring.National Park Service, \\"Battle Summary: Bean's Station, Tennessee.\\" Retrieved: February 19, 2008. Sulphur Springs Academy Rev. William Kindsland deeded one acre of land to trustees J.N. Mitchell, J.H. Weaver and George Lyons to be used as a school site, May 30, 1874. School at that time was being taught in a small log church, known as Sulphur Springs Baptist Church. A one-room building was constructed, and it is believed that the late J.T. Justus was the first teacher. Later, a second room was added to the school. Academies were first heard of about 1806, but did not do much until 1816 when the State of Tennessee received a grant from the [Federal] government sufficient for one academy in each county. Those academies took the place of high schools. The state paid for land, building and boarding houses. The Grainger County Academy was in Rutledge, and was called Madison Academy (named after President James Madison). C.C. Justus was appointed to look after the school. Around 1868, after a second room was added at Sulphur Springs School, they added advanced subjects such as Latin and Algebra. This was about the time Sulphur Springs Academy at Joppa came into existence. The school was small, but enrollment was large. Mr. J.M. Justus built houses to be used as dormitories where the pupils went to study between classes. People who attended the Sulphur Springs Academy came for a purpose, to learn. Many teachers, doctors, lawyers, postal workers, bankers, judges and musicians were educated at the Sulphur Springs Academy in Spring House (now Joppa), Tennessee. The Old Joppa School (known today as Joppa Elementary School) was built circa 1878 and burned in approximately 1899. In 1900, a second building was constructed through personal donations to accommodate grades 1-8, which by this time the Peavine train was running and many people rode the train to school. The Old Joppa School was demolished in 1966 to make way for a third building that was built the following year. In 1881, Sunday school service was started in the Old Joppa School. On December 26, 1921, John and Mary Morgan deeded 1/4 acre of land, and in 1922 a church (known today as Joppa United Methodist Church) was organized. On May 4, 1924, the current church building was dedicated. Spring House, Tennessee Spring House Post Office was a small building over a spring in front of the Seymour home. In the same community, located behind where Joppa School is located today, was a church called Spring House Baptist Church. An African-American minister came and preached a series of sermons in the church and it is said by those who attended that each sermon was centered around the city of Joppa, and he made the statement that \\"Joppa was a sabbath day's journey from Jerusalem.\\" There was a young man, Marshall Lowe, noted for his humor, who heard these sermons and began to have a saying, \\"Let's all go over to Joppa.\\" In 1894, Professor P.E. Aston and C.C. Justus, both of whom taught at the former Sulphur Springs Academy, approached the Tennessee State Legislature and was subsequently successful in having the name of \\"Spring House Post Office\\" (1845‚Äì1893) changed to Joppa. The post office was then moved from a location near Ellis Farm on Blaines Chapel Road to the J.H. Hammer Store near the intersection of U.S. Route 11W and Joppa Mountain Road, where it was then changed to the name of \\"Joppa Post\\" (1933‚Äì1950) until its closure. In April 2012, the Grainger County Board of Education authorized negotiations to purchase the old Joppa Post store for possible future use as a drip field for the sewer system at Joppa Elementary School. On June 18, 2012, the Grainger County BOE completed the purchase of the old Joppa Post store for $28,500, and soon after the structure was razed. Cherokee Lake, created by the Tennessee Valley Authority in 1941 with the completion of Cherokee Dam, is located just southeast of Joppa. Hang Gliding Hang gliding from Joppa (Clinch) Mountain is the goal of many hang gliding enthusiasts around the world, according to the president of one of the largest hang gliding associations in the United States. Hang gliding on Joppa Mountain started in the mid-1970s and enjoyed considerable notoriety until the late 1980s. The 1979 USHPA regional competition was held on Joppa Mountain, which is also the site of the Tennessee Flex Wing Free Flight Record of by Ellis Newkirk. Area residents describe the weekends around the Joppa and Powder Springs communities as being full of activities, with spectators lined along U.S. Route 11W (Rutledge Pike) and TN State Route 131 as hang gliders would launch from Buzzard Rock, on the Joppa Mountain summit, and glide over the Poor, Richland, and Clinch Valleys, landing at various local landing zones or destinations as far away as Virginia, Kentucky, and Chattanooga, Tennessee. Geography Joppa is located in western Grainger County at (36.279991, -83.518008). The community is within the Richland Valley, and extends north into the parallel, smaller Poor Valley. Richland Valley stretches for some along the southern base of Clinch Mountain Ridge between Blaine and Rutledge. Originating in the hills behind Grainger County High School, Richland Creek traverses most of the valley en route to its confluence along the Holston River, approximately southwest of Joppa. The area considered to be Joppa runs roughly from the top of Clinch Mountain Ridge just southwest of where Joppa Mountain Road crosses at Powder Spring Gap, then about northeasterly along the ridge to just above where the intersection of Corbin Lake and Poor Valley Roads meet between the Poor Valley Knobs, then turns south and runs roughly across U.S. Route 11W to the top of the Richland Knobs near Owl Hole Gap Road. From there, it runs another southwesterly along the top of the Richland Knobs. Joppa is centered around Joppa Elementary School located at the junction of the Federal Road/U.S. Route 11W/Rutledge Pike, which connects the community to Kingsport to the east and Knoxville to the west, and Joppa Mountain Road, which crosses Clinch Mountain Ridge via the Powder Spring Gap to the community of Powder Springs to the northwest. Starting from the Clinch Mountain's southern terminus at Signal Point peak near Blaine, Joppa Mountain Road is the first of only twelve transportation crossings from southwest to northeast along its entire length. From the Joppa Mountain summit at Buzzard Rock, elevation , the U.S. states of Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, Virginia, and the entire breadth of eastern Tennessee can be seen, including the Great Smoky Mountains and Cumberland Gap.  Natural history  = Geology = Even by a geologist's standards, the Appalachians are very old mountains: The bedrock was formed 1 billion years ago and the mountains are 500 million years old, 10 times older and once taller than the Rockies, Sierras, Andes, and Himalayas. They have been created, worn down, and created again as a result of tectonic and weathering forces. Continental drift, a phenomenon that continues on earth's surface today, has played a major role. The legacy of tectonic events in East Tennessee created the mountainous physiographic province known as the Valley and Ridge (commonly known as the Great Valley of East Tennessee), within which Joppa, TN is situated. The Valley and Ridge takes its name from its long ridges and valleys oriented in a northeast-southwest direction. This topography was shaped by folding and faulting that occurred during the middle Ordovician period of the Paleozoic Era by the collision of plates. Great force from the east, possibly from northern Africa colliding into eastern North America, rippled the landscape like a rug pushed against a wall from one side. The collision which caused the uplift of the mountains began around 440 to 480 million years ago and ended around 230 million years ago. Then erosion set in, shaping more resistant rock into ridges and cutting valleys into weaker ones. The area is dominated by dolomite and highly erodible limestone, making caves numerous. The region has great habitat diversity and supports an especially diverse fish fauna, including the Upper Clinch River, which holds one of the most diverse fish faunas in North America.Vernon and Cathy Summerlin, Longstreet Highroad Guide to the Tennessee Mountains Published (print): 1999, Published (Web): January, 2003, .

It was built by Jacob Eisenmann in 1907 and is the only synagogue in Antwerp to have survived the Holocaust and the Nazi occupation of Belgium. Jacob Eisenmann Jacob (Jacques) Samuel Eisenmann was born in Frankfurt am Main. In 1884 he moved to Antwerp, where he established a company in the import of dried fruits and industrial fibers from the Belgian Congo. He was a very successful businessman and reputed to have been close with King Leopold II. His wife was the daughter of Eliezer Liepman Philip Prins and his brother-in-law was the noted painter Benjamin Prins. Eisenmann was extremely well versed in both Jewish and general topics. He was a student of Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsh, under whom Eisenmann had studied in Frankfurt. Founding of the Minyan The tradition of the Jewish community in his native Frankfurt was close to his heart, and he was annoyed at the way of life of Eastern European immigrants brought to Antwerp. Specifically the lack of decorum during the tefillot and conversation during prayers that perturbed him. As a result, he decided to start his own minyan, one which the traditions of the Jewish community in Frankfurt, would be kept. In 1905 he rented three rooms in the Breughelstraat. In the beginning there were only 20-odd members of his minyan, but soon, the number of worshipers burgeoned and it became quite clear that a new space was necessary. As a result, Eisenmann decided to purchase a piece of land on Oostenstraat across the street from the railroad embankment. The design In 1908 Eisenmann bought two adjoining buildings, and built the synagogue to stretch through the interior of both. The facades of the buildings were not to be recognizable as a Jewish place of worship or Shul. This stealth was a crucial factor in the survival of the synagogue during the Second World War. As an architect Eisenmann chose a Mr De Lange, who had just graduated from the Royal Academy of Fine Arts. The synagogue was completed in 1909. Book and Centennial In 2004 a niece of Jacob Eisenmann, Els Bendheim wrote a book about the history and significance of this unique synagogue. The book was the result of much effort and research and was published by KTAV Publishing House in 2004. In 2009 a group of descendants of Jacob Eisenmann gathered in Antwerp to celebrate and commemorate the 100th anniversary of the synagogue's founding in 1909. Over 200 people gathered at a festive ceremony among them the synagogue's primary benefactor Mr. Jack Lunzer.

Occasionally, a few scholars refer to him as Ji Danfu, referencing his surname Ji ().

His son Ju continued this before Duke Liu settled his people at a place called Bin. The rulers of Bin were listed as Qingjie, Huangpu (), Chaifu (), Huiyu (), Gongfei (), Gaoyu (), Yayu (), and Gongshu Zulei ().Bo Yang (). .

After finding his choice confirmed by their oracle bones, the other people who had lived in Bin left the caves and huts they had fled to and followed them, erecting a new city complete with a formal palace, ancestral temple, and altar. The rapid success of the new location then caused neighboring tribes of Yu and Rui to join Zhou, rather than attack. Danfu was later credited with much of the growth of the Zhou, receiving a hymn among the Great Odes of the Classic of Poetry and the \\"Mount Qi Song\\", a zither melody supposedly composed by the Duke of Zhou. In traditional Chinese records, he was considered to have himself created the state of Zhou, sometimes taken to be an indigenous place-name for his new settlement along the Wei. In fact, modern excavation of the Shang oracle bones have found references to a Zhou at least a century before this during the reign of Wu Ding. The earlier Zhou seems to be well away from the traditional locations for Bin, as well, leading scholars to posit a much longer migration west from Shanxi. Posterity By his wife, the Lady Jiang, Old Duke Danfu was said to be the father of Taibo, Zhongyong, and Jili. Zhongyong was claimed as the ancestor of the kings of Wu; Jili, by the kings of Zhou.

Operators and the companies that provide the systems used maintain that they operate in accordance with laws governing promotions and sweepstakes, but critics of sweepstakes parlors have argued that these establishments are designed to exploit technicalities to skirt gambling laws, and that their patrons are more interested in using the facilities for gambling than actually using the services that they had purchased. Multiple U.S. states have enacted laws designed to ban or restrict the operations of sweepstakes parlors. Business model A sweepstakes parlor sells a service or product, usually internet access or telephone cards. When a purchase is made, a number of chances to win prizes are given to the consumer. Proponents compare this practice to similar promotional giveaways by other businesses, such as McDonald's' Monopoly promotion, which are legal in most areas. In one example of a sweepstakes parlor that sells phone cards, the operator gives away 100 chances for every dollar spent on a phone card. Chances may also be given without a purchase just for coming into the establishment. Sweepstakes parlors are most often located in or adjacent to strip malls. Computer terminals are set up inside the parlors, where patrons can see if they have won a prize by playing a casino-style game, similar to a video slot machine. The decor of the cafes may also include casino-inspired elements and motifs. The software necessary to operate a sweepstakes parlor may be obtained from one of a number of companies; in return for providing the software, a percentage of the profits is typically paid. There are also installation companies that provide assistance in setting up cafes. Legal challenges Sweepstakes parlors have attracted scrutiny from law enforcement, and local and state legislators. In at least 20 states, the legality of the cafes has faced challenges in the form of criminal complaints, lawsuits, and bans. The industry formed lobbies to protect and promote their legal interests. The industry has maintained, at times successfully, that the business model and the systems used do not meet the legal definition of gambling in the US. The federal definition characterizes gambling as meeting three criteria: consideration, prize, and chance. Sweepstakes parlor operators have contended that the prizes are predetermined, and therefore the system does not meet the criterion of chance. They have also held that chances are given even without purchase, and therefore the criterion of consideration is not met. In 2013, sweepstakes parlors were banned in Florida, Ohio and several California municipalities. Cases pertaining to the parlors reached the state supreme courts of both Alabama and North Carolina. In Alabama, one operator's sweepstakes model was found to be in violation of state gambling laws; the court agreed with District Attorney Barber that the system used fit the description of a slot machine, that chance occurred at the point of sale, and that consideration was not negated even though it was possible to obtain free chances. In North Carolina, the industry argued that a statute prohibiting sweepstakes from using an \\"entertaining display\\" violated their First Amendment rights, but the North Carolina Supreme Court disagreed and upheld the ban. The sweepstakes industry however, attempted to work around these restrictions by restyling their games; in North Carolina, sweepstakes software providers implemented \\"pre-reveal\\" mechanisms, which attempted to comply with the prohibition of \\"entertaining displays\\" by revealing the player's prize in plain text before the game is played. In October 2013, two Florida sweepstakes parlors reopened as charity bingo parlors (which are legal under state law), but also offering electronic pull-tabs (\\"instant bingo\\"). In December 2013, following a report on them by the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, the two locations were issued subpoenas by police requesting access to their financial records. Rather than comply, the two locations voluntarily shuttered instead. In May 2015, federal prosecutors announced that they had agreed to a settlement with five sweepstakes software providers, under which they would stop doing business in North Carolina by July 1, 2015. =Other opposition= Advocates for legal gaming also object to the parlors on the grounds that they are unregulated. They argue, among other things, that the sweepstakes parlors encroach on the business of state-run lotteries and licensed gambling, thus reducing the alleged benefits to public programs that get a portion of funds from legal gambling. In addition, in states where a compact exists under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, if sweepstakes parlors are not made illegal they may continue to conflict with the compact. Florida's sweepstakes parlor ban also had a chilling effect on arcades; the law prohibits devices defined as \\"gambling machines\\" from awarding prizes more than $0.75 in value and accepting cards or bills as payment. Although the law does contain specific distinctions meant to exclude arcade redemption games from its scope, the law attracted concern from the arcade industry, who felt that it could be interpreted to ban their operation‚Äîespecially at facilities that use card- based systems for credits rather than tokens. In January 2015, as a cautionary measure, Disney Parks removed redemption and claw machines from the arcades of its Florida resorts: representatives of the company have supported attempts to clarify the wording of the sweepstakes parlor ban to reduce its potential effects on arcades.

The Raleigh and Augusta Air Line Railroad traces its history back to the early 1850s, when the line was chartered by the North Carolina General Assembly as the Chatham Railroad in February 1851. It changed its name to the Raleigh and Augusta Air Line Railroad in 1871, and was chartered by the South Carolina General Assembly in February 1878.Wikipedia, WikiProject Trains, ICC valuations, Seaboard Air Line Railway In 1871, the Chatham Railroad was reorganized as the Raleigh and Augusta Air Line Railroad.North Carolina Railroads, Raleigh and Augusta Air Line Railroad The carrier's goal was to build a line from Raleigh to Augusta, Georgia, through Columbia, South Carolina. However, it never progressed past the North Carolina-South Carolina state line, where it met the Palmetto Railroad. The Raleigh and Gaston Railroad controlled the Raleigh and Augusta Air-Line Railroad, owning most of its stock. By this time, the Raleigh and Augusta stretched from Raleigh, North Carolina, toward Hamlet, North Carolina. Later, the Raleigh and Gaston, and Raleigh and Augusta both fell on hard times during the Panic of 1873, and John M.

In the aftermath of the Battle of Chroberz, Polish insurgents under Marian Langiewicz were intercepted in a forest by a stronger Russian force. The battle took place in a very unfavorable circumstances, since the Polish forces were caught by the Russians while trying to withdraw through inhospitable forests and swamp land; neither side was prepared to fight in this terrain. Grochowiska . last accessed 24 January 2011 Langiewicz's force was composed of two infantry regiments with three battalions of 350 soldiers each (so, 2100 infantry), two units (pu≈Çk) of cavalry, 400-strong each, 100 military engineers, 150 in the command units (incl. its security detachment) and about 450 non-combatant support personnel. Battle The insurgents were attacked on the flank by a column of troops moving from Stopnica, as well as by the troops in their front. Despite the initially unfavorable situation for the Polish forces, which were trying to avoid contact with the opponent, a charge by the Zouaves of Death, under the command of Francois Rochebrune, captured the Russian artillery and eventually forced the Russians to withdraw. The kosynierzy (peasant troops armed with scythes), under the command of Col. DƒÖbrowski also contributed to the overall outcome of the engagement when they successfully attacked and routed two regiments of Smolensk infantry. Another Polish unit under Dionizy Czachowski covered the rear of the insurrectionist forces, and after heavy fighting moved towards Stopnica. During the battle, Langiewicz lost control over his troops who initially panicked.Bartek Rogalski, \\"\\"≈ªuawi ≈ömierci‚Äù w Powstaniu Styczniowym\\" (Zouaves of Death in the January Uprising), last accessed 14 January 2011 It was Rochebrune, who with the help of his Zouaves, managed to restore discipline and lead a successful attack on Russian positions. He did so by personally grabbing panicked soldiers, throwing them back into the line, pointing his gun at them and cursing in broken Polish (\\"Psiakehv! Ktoha godzina?\\" ‚Äì \\"Goddammit! Would you tell me the time?\\" ‚Äì which according to contemporary sources was the only Polish he knew). As a consequence after the battle, Rochebrune was promoted to the rank of general and considered for the role of the overall leader of the uprising (ultimately rejected for political reasons). Aftermath Despite the fact that Polish forces successfully escaped annihilation, they found themselves dispersed, were forced to retreat towards Pi≈Ñcz√≥w and had trouble reorganizing afterward. As a result, shortly after the battle, Langiewicz crossed into Austria with a portion of his troops, where he was interned a week later. This ended Langiewicz's short career as the dictator (leader) of the uprising (he was chosen around 10 March). Hence, while the Polish forces managed to repel the attack and avoid destruction or capture, their high losses and eventual retreat across the border led some commentators to describe the battle as a Pyrrhic victory for the Poles. Notable participants Albert Chmielowski, who was later to become known as \\"Saint Albert\\" of the Catholic Church after he had founded the Albertines, took part in the battle on the Polish side, as a 17-year-old recruit. Priest Agrypin Konarski also participated in the battle. The future painter Bronis≈Çaw Abramowicz served as adjutant to Langiewicz during the battle and was wounded.

Construction, acquisition, and commissioning At the suggestion of Assistant Secretary of the Navy (and future President of the United States) Franklin D. Roosevelt (1882‚Äì1945), R. E. Tod of New York City, seeking a way to contribute to the U.S. war effort during World War I, contracted with the Herreshoff Manufacturing Company at Bristol, Rhode Island, for one of a small group of 60-ton steel-hulled steam-powered boats built to a naval patrol boat design for private owners with the intention that they would be made available to the U.S. Navy in time of war. Tods boat, with the builders name Herreshoff No. 308, was completed in 1917. On 21 February 1918, the U.S. Navy acquired Herreshoff No. 308 from Tod for use as a section patrol boat during World War I. She was commissioned at Newport, Rhode Island, as USS Herreshoff No. 308 (SP-2232) on 23 February 1918. Operational history After spending a short time at New London, Connecticut, fitting out with listening gear, Herreshoff No. 308 departed New London on 5 May 1918 in company with the patrol boats and bound for the Panama Canal Zone, stopping at Charleston, South Carolina; Key West, Florida; and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, en route. She arrived at Crist√≥bal in the Canal Zone on 1 June 1918. For the next two years she served on patrol duty in the Canal Zone at Crist√≥bal and Balboa. Herreshoff No. 308 was loaned to the United States Department of War on 14 October 1920 for use by the Governor of the Panama Canal Zone. The Canal Zone government used her as a patrol craft.

He fought in the Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878), Russo-Japanese War of 1904‚Äì1905, and in World War I. Biography Kashtalinsky was a graduate of the 2nd St. Petersburg Military Gymnasium and Pavlovsk Military School and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1869, serving with the 1st Infantry Battalion of the Grenadier Regiment of the Life Guards. In 1874, he transferred to the 6th Turkestan Infantry Battalion, with which he participated in two expeditions under General Alexander Konstantinovich Abramov in the Russian conquest of the Zarafshan Valley, during which he was awarded the Order of St. Anne (3rd degree with swords and bow) for bravery in combat. At the start of the Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878), voluntarily enlisted in the Bulgarian Army and was wounded during the Battle of Shipka Pass. He was promoted to captain, and was decorated with the Order of St. Vladimir (4th class with swords and bow), Order of St. Anne (2nd class, with swords) and Order of St. Stanislaus 2nd degree with swords. Kashtalinsky subsequently was appointed provincial military commander in the Kuban region and Andean province (modern Dagestan), and commander of reserve brigades in the Caucasus from 1888. He was promoted to major general in 1900 upon his retirement due to illness. In 1902, Kashtalinsky reentered military service as commander of a brigade of the 33rd Infantry Division. In 1903, he became commander of the 3rd East Siberian Rifle Brigade, and from 1904 was commander of the 3rd East Siberian Infantry Division stationed in Manchuria. At the start of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904‚Äì1905, he was stationed on the Yalu River under the command of General Mikhail Zasulich's 2nd Siberian Corps with orders prevent the Imperial Japanese Army from crossing into Manchuria. In the subsequent Battle of Yalu River, his forces bore the brunt of the Japanese assault, and without adequate support from General Zasulich, were routed with heavy losses. Kashtalinsky was himself wounded in the battle. Kashtalinsky would subsequently participate in other battles of the war, including the Battle of Liaoyang, Battle of Shaho, as well as the Battle of Mukden. He was awarded the Order of St. George (4th class) on November 1, 1905 for courage and diligence in these campaigns. He was also awarded the Order of St. Stanislaus 1st class with swords and Order of St. Anne, 1st class with swords and promotion to the rank of lieutenant general. In 1907, Kashtalinsky briefly commanded the 11th East Siberian Rifle Regiment before being appointed commander of the 4th Army Corps. He retired a second time from active service in 1908, with a promotion to full general. With the start of World War I, Kashtalinsky again came out of retirement, and was appointed commander of the Russian 28th Army Corps on September 26, 1914. He received the Order of the White Eagle, with swords in 1915, and on October 6, 1915 went into the reserves at the Kiev Military District. However, on April 20, 1916 he became commander of the Russian 40th Army Corps which saw considerable combat on the Austrian front in May‚ÄìJune 1916. He received the Order of St. George, 3rd class on August 4, 1916. Kashtalinsky was appointed a member of the Alexander Committee of the wounded in November 1916.

Education Antoine entered the Society of Jesus in 1932, was sent to Calcutta in 1939, dedicated himself to the study of Sanskrit, and became the first Jesuit to obtain a master's degree from the University of Calcutta in Sanskrit philology.\\"Avant- propos,\\" R.

Besides this, he held a Licentiate in Philosophy, a Licentiate in Theology, a B.A. Classics. Work Antoine arrived in India in 1939 and became an Indian citizen in 1950. His untimely death from liver cancer occurred in 1981. During the 42 years he spent in India, mainly in Calcutta, he contributed much to the Bengali culture, the diffusion of Sanskrit and the life of the Church in Bengal. In the words of Felix Raj, \\"he was an eminent priest, a scholar, an accomplished teacher, a gifted musician and singer and a dear friend\\". From 1956, he was lecturer in the Department of Comparative Literature of the Jadavpur University. He also taught at St. Xavier's College, Calcutta. In 1950 he founded the dialogue center Shanti Bhavan with Pierre Fallon as a center of inter-faith, inter-cultural dialogue and their home amidst a population of middle-class intelligentsia. For many years, their periodical, Dar≈õan Cakra, attracted keen professors of philosophy and other intellectuals. But Shanti Bhavan was above all a centre of friendly conversations, music, songs, bhajans and Eucharistic liturgy. From there Antoine produced his ten books (Sanskrit manual, Bengali hymn book, translations, Indological essays, ecumenical dialogue, etc.) and as many articles.De Smet, \\"Foreword\\", Religious Hinduism, 4th rev. edition, ed.

Antoine contributed himself nine of the chapters of this book; a 'third' revised edition was produced in 1968, and a fourth in 1997. Most of his articles are archived by the Jadavpur Journal of Comparative Literature, published by the Department of Comparative Literature, Jadavpur University, annually. In Volume 6 (1966), edited by Naresh Guha, Father Antoine's article titled \\"The Vision of Dante\\" was published. Here he discussed critically the approaches to Dante's The Divine Comedy, analyzing the role of Virgil and allegories used by Dante. The Volume 8 ( 1968), edited by Amiya Dev, have his article titled \\"Greek Tragedy and Sanskrit Drama\\". Here he discussed how both Greek Tragedies and Sanskrit literary pieces were inspired by their respective epic traditions, yet when the Greek literary pieces were meant for competition, Sanskrit pieces were to satisfy the ‚Äò critical taste of refined audience'. The 9th Volume of JJCL , published his article titled \\"Classical Forms of the Simile\\". He studied two different techniques in the use of literary images. He took the examples of Greek literature and Dante, and explained that when in West, literary images were taken as an analogy, in East, poets like Kalidasa preferred using images as alamkaras, extolling virtues. In used padas, succession of images can be traced, each describing virtues of the characters like Sita or Shakuntala. Antoine, critically commented on the use of these images and similes. http://jjcl.jdvu.ac.in/jjcl/display_a.php The 11th Volume was edited by Amiya Dev. It has an essay named \\"Calliope and the Epic of Ravana\\". Here he discussed oral epic tradition of Ramayana and Homeric epics, and how those symbolically represented multiple strands of culture and practice of their roots. Substantiating how Calliope's language was a language of myth and 'quest of a society', while the multiple layers of narration in The Ramayana played with narrative motifs, Antoine unpacked how the narrative voice and position had significant role in the oral narratives. The 12th Volume published his article titled \\"Calliope and Rama‚Äôs Initiation\\". With reference to The Ramayana and The Iliad, he argued that to fathom the framework and richness of epic tradition, the emphasis should be on the materials and messages of the long oral tradition, abandoning the concept of 'original'. JJCL 13th Voulme published his article titled \\"From Aristotle to Roland Barthes\\", that was part of the annual lectures at the Amal Bhattacharjee Memorial Centre for European Studies in Calcutta. In this article he stated how Aristotle's ideas of plot structure and evaluation of plot can be interpreted with reference to Russian Formalism, Linguistic Analogies and Levels of Narratives. He stated that when Aristotle's propositions would be scrutinized in these critical approaches, the hidden dynamism of narratives would unfold the working of story-telling and synchronic character of its language. In the JJCL 16‚Äì17th Volume, his article titled \\" Bharata and Aristotle\\" explained how Greek Tragedy and Sanskrit comedy weren't merely two conceptions of dramatic action, but also be scrutinized if testified with the tenets by Bharata regarding 'five avasthas' and Aristotle's ideas on 'Complex Plot' as he discussed in his Poetics. The 20‚Äì21st Volume printed his essay \\" The Curse in Oedipus Rex and Abhijnanashakuntalam\\". Here he discussed how despite 'curse' being a motif of both the Greek Tragedy and Sanskrit drama, the world views shaped the plots in different tone. In the world of Kalidasa, curse could be mitigated. So, even when Dushyanta forgot due to Dushyanta's curse, the ring could bring back recognition of Shakuntala. Whereas in the Greek world, the curse wrecked Oedipus' s life, no matter how far he tried to escape from the oracle. Oedipus' strive to escape, rather brought him closer to the fulfillment of the oracle. From Volume 20 to 24 of JJCL, his article titled \\" The Technique of Oral Composition in the Ramayana\\", was published, part by part. While the first part elucidated the shift from one literary level to the other and the juxtaposed or intermingled levels of composition in The Ramayana, the second part was on how 'maha compounds' with metrical patterns, use of dhimat, tejas, cetas, ojas, adjectives ending in ‚Äìin, and compounds ending with atman were used. The profuse use of patronymics were discussed too, by him. As continuation of the article, in the 23rd Volume, with examples from the Sanskrit Ramayana, he discussed the metrical patterns and compounds used by the bards, whereas in 24th Volume, he concluded how despite the problems faced by traditional bards, with the traditional formulae consisting verbal expressions and roots, the adjectival or adverbial expression enhanced the narrative quality of the adikavya. http://jjcl.jdvu.ac.in/jjcl/display_a.php http://jjcl.jdvu.ac.in/jjcl/display_a.php Bibliography =Primary bibliography= *\\"Religious Symbolism in the Kausitaki Upanisad\\".

Education and early career Born in Denver, Colorado, to Harry McComb and Estelle Tredenick, McComb's family moved to Kingman, Arizona. Then, McComb's family moved to California, and he graduated high school in Los Angeles. Entry for Marshall F. McComb. In 1917, he earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from Stanford University. On November 24, 1917, during World War I, he was commissioned an ensign in the United States Navy. After his discharge, he resumed his studies and received a Bachelor of Laws degree from Yale Law School cum laude in 1919. In February 1920, he was admitted to the California Bar, then was a Professor of Political Science at the University of California, Los Angeles from 1920 to 1927. In 1927, California Governor C. C. Young appointed McComb a Judge of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, where he served until March 1937. Then, Governor Frank Merriam elevated McComb to the California Court of Appeal for the Second District as an Associate Justice in Division Two, where he served from March 13, 1937 to January 1956. On February 18, 1932, both McComb and fellow future justice B. Rey Schauer were commissioned as officers in the United States Naval Reserve. California Supreme Court McComb swearing in Ronald Reagan as Governor of California in 1967 In 1955, Governor Goodwin Knight appointed McComb to the Supreme Court of California as an Associate Justice, where he served from January 1956 to May 2, 1977. For much of his career there, McComb formed the core of its conservative wing and often dissented from the liberal majority's opinions. In 1967, McComb swore in Ronald Reagan to the latter's first term as Governor of California. In 1968, McComb joined the dissenting opinion of Justice Louis H. Burke in Dillon v. Legg, in which the Court's majority established the tort of negligent infliction of emotional distress; Burke and McComb argued that the majority ruling opened up defendants to \\"potentially infinite liability beyond any rational relationship to their culpability.\\" In the 1972 case California v. Anderson, in which the majority ruled 6‚Äì1 that the death penalty was unconstitutional, McComb was the lone dissenter, arguing that the death penalty deterred crime, noting numerous Supreme precedents upholding the death penalty's constitutionality (including 11 in the prior three and a half years), and stating that the legislative and initiative processes were the only appropriate avenues to determine whether the death penalty should be allowed. The majority's decision spared the lives of 105 death row inmates, including Sirhan Sirhan, assassin of Robert F. Kennedy, and serial killer Charles Manson. McComb was so upset about the Anderson decision that he walked out of the courtroom. Nine months later, the people of California would pass Proposition 17 by a 2‚Äì1 margin, reinstating the death penalty as an option for all prosecutions that took place after the adoption of Proposition 17. In 1976, McComb joined Justice William P. Clark, Jr.'s dissenting opinion in Tarasoff v. Regents of the University of California, as McComb and Clark argued that doctor-patient confidentiality was \\"essential to effectively treat the mentally ill, and that imposing a duty on doctors to disclose patient threats to potential victims would greatly impair treatment\\" while the majority held that mental health professionals have a duty to protect individuals who are being threatened with bodily harm by a patient. McComb did join the 1976 court majority in Marvin v. Marvin, in which the court ruled that although California does not recognize common-law marriage, people who cohabitate for long periods of time and commingle their assets are allowed to plead and prove marriage-like contracts for support and division of property. McComb's distinguished judicial career had a rather sad end. On May 2, 1977, a panel of Court of Appeal justices, sitting as an acting Supreme Court, forced McComb into retirement by affirming a state Commission on Judicial Performance decision that McComb had senile dementia and was no longer able to carry out his judicial duties.McComb v. Commission on Judicial Performance, 19 Cal. 3d (Spec. Trib. Supp.) 1, 138 Cal. Rptr. 459, 564 P.2d 1 (1977). In 1981, McComb died in Los Angeles and is buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Honors and awards In 1936, McComb was awarded a Doctor of Laws degree from Loyola Law School. In 2005, the McComb Foundation established the Justice Marshall F. McComb Professorship at Southwestern Law School. Personal life In August 22, 1921, McComb first married Agnes I. Taylor (Challinor), a widow. They had a daughter, Martha Estelle McComb (Mullin), who graduated from Stanford University in 1944. After McComb and his first wife divorced, on March 22, 1930, he remarried to Kendra K. Hamilton in Yuma, Arizona. He later married Margaret G. McComb, who lived for another 22 years after his death, dying on November 4, 2003. References Further reading  External links * Marshall F.

Armstead states that the movie \\"wasn‚Äôt all that bad all things considered. The car racing scenes, minus the CGI cutaways, were far better than I expected them to be.\\" Trevor Anderson of Movie MavericksMovie Mavericks gave the film a mixed review. The negative aspects cited include unnecessary cursing and nudity, and the CGI. The review however, was mostly positive praising director Cole McKay for good acting from the actors and well-framed shots. The actors are especially praised including Zedrick Restauro and Jared Kahn, having added \\"a much needed spark to the group dynamic, particularly in the scene where they steal a car from an impound lot.\\" The actor described as the one that \\"shines the brightest\\" is Tommy Nash, even though only being in the movie for the first fifteen minutes. The film gained a user rating of 2.1/10 on IMDB due to poor special effects, plot, quality of production and much more. =Inaccuracy= One of the biggest complaints about this film, being that it is a film aimed at car enthusiasts, is the extremely poor continuity. At one point in the film a car changes make and model with no given explanation and is treated as if it is the same car, all the while being called the name of a third car (The car changes from FC Chassis Mazda RX-7 to a Nissan 240sx during fast scenes). The car is also referred to as a MX-5, which is a Mazda Miata trim. The film also makes many general references to an estimated car capabilities, just like the Nissan 370Z in the beginning of the movie and the Nissan GT-R that it races against. Most of the cars' estimates are not true to actual car potential. (The FC RX-7 is capable of 160+ with boost mods alone.) The general negative response to this film can be seen by the statistics, which shown that 58.3% of people on IMDb rated the film 1/10 and is often called the worst film ever.

The film begins with the character of Mother Maiden (played by Dawn Mastin) writing a letter and reciting a monologue which explains that she controls lost souls to seek revenge on \\"those with a dark heart.\\" While Mother Maiden continues to speak, the film cuts between her and the \\"lost souls\\" which she controls. Firstly, we see the character of Sin√©ad dragging an unconscious man on top of a train, who awakens just before being killed by a low hanging rail road signal. We then cut to \\"The Triplets\\" (more of Mother Maiden's workers) crawling into a window, after which an unseen woman screams and the Triplets reappear with their mouths smeared with blood. Finally, we are shown a man shaving before an arm bursts from his bathroom mirror and strangles him. At this point, the \\"Faster\\" music video begins with the band playing the song in full. As it ends, we see Sin√©ad's corpse awakening in a morgue. The script was written by Steven O'Connell and Tim Smit.

Construction, acquisition, and commissioning At the suggestion of Assistant Secretary of the Navy (and future President of the United States) Franklin D. Roosevelt (1882‚Äì1945), businessman Payne Whitney (1876‚Äì1927) of New York City, seeking a way to contribute to the U.S. war effort during World War I, contracted with the Herreshoff Manufacturing Company at Bristol, Rhode Island, for one of a small group of 60-ton steel-hulled steam-powered boats built to a naval patrol boat design for private owners with the intention that they would be made available to the U.S. Navy in time of war. Whitneys boat, with the builders name Herreshoff No. 321, was completed in 1917. On 24 March 1918, the U.S. Navy acquired Herreshoff No. 321 from Whitney for use as a section patrol boat during World War I. She was commissioned at Newport, Rhode Island, as USS Herreshoff No. 321 (SP-2235) the same day. Operational history After spending a short time at New London, Connecticut, fitting out with listening gear, Herreshoff No. 321 departed New London on 5 May 1918 in company with the patrol boats and bound for the Panama Canal Zone, stopping at Charleston, South Carolina; Key West, Florida; and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, en route.

He was one of the most influential blues guitarists of the 1980s, described by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as \\"the second coming of the blues\\". Vaughan spent much of his last days performing with his band Double Trouble as the opening act for Eric Clapton at Alpine Valley Music Theatre. After the concert concluded, he and three members of Clapton's tour entourage boarded a helicopter that crashed into the side of a nearby ski hill shortly after takeoff. The Civil Air Patrol was notified of the crash at 4:30 a.m., and authorities were called to locate the scene of the accident. All five people were pronounced dead on arrival. The autopsy concluded that Vaughan suffered multiple internal injuries and died of exsanguination due to blunt trauma. At the inquest, the coroner found no evidence of drug or alcohol use and recorded death by misadventure. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) concluded that the pilot failed to gain sufficient altitude to avoid rising terrain. Vaughan was buried at Laurel Land Cemetery in Dallas, Texas, on August 31, 1990. In 1992, his family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Omniflight Helicopters, which was settled for an undisclosed amount in 1995. Crash The day before his death, Vaughan told his band and crew members about a nightmare that he had in which he was at his own funeral and saw thousands of mourners. He felt \\"terrified, yet almost peaceful\\". Backstage after the show that evening, the musicians talked about playing together again, particularly with Eric Clapton for a series of dates at London's Royal Albert Hall in February and March 1991 as a tribute to Jimi Hendrix.Dickerson, p. 154 Moments later, Clapton's tour manager Peter Jackson said that the weather was getting worse and they had to leave soon.Leigh, p. 3 Vaughan's last words to drummer Chris Layton were \\"I love ya.\\"Everitt, p. 132 Four helicopters were waiting to transport concert group members to Chicago. Vaughan was with his brother Jimmie Vaughan and Jimmie's wife Connie as they went to board their reserved Bell 206B Jet Ranger helicopter piloted by Jeff Brown. Eric Clapton's tour manager Peter Jackson had told Vaughan that seats were reserved for all three of them. However, they discovered that their seats had been taken by Clapton's agent Bobby Brooks, bodyguard Nigel Browne, and assistant tour manager Colin Smythe, with only one empty seat available.Gregory, p. 119 Vaughan asked Jimmie and Connie if he could take the last seat, saying \\"I really need to get back.\\" Jimmie and Connie obliged and caught the next flight in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, with manager Mark Proct. Vaughan and the other three passengers departed aboard the third helicopter in dense fog at 1 a.m.Kitts, p. 70 Jeff Brown piloted the helicopter off the golf course, at a higher speed and slightly lower altitude than the others.Everitt, p. 134 It banked sharply to the left and crashed into the side of a 300-foot ski slope,Dickerson, p. 155 about from takeoff. All on board were killed instantly. There was no fire or explosion, and the bodies and debris were scattered over .Everitt, p. 134 No one was aware of the crash until the helicopter failed to arrive at its destination the next morning. A Wisconsin Civil Air Patrol search airplane found the wreckage at 7 a.m., below the summit of the hill. Shortly after, Clapton and Jimmie Vaughan were called to the morgue to identify the bodies. According to an autopsy report, Vaughan had suffered many unsurvivable injuries, such as transection and dissection of the aorta and multiple depressed skull fractures, along with a ruptured spleen and liver and fractures of the right thigh bone and ribs. An investigation found that no drugs or alcohol were involved and that all victims had worn seatbelts. No mechanical failures or malfunctions were found with the helicopter. Pilot Jeff Brown was instrument-rated and had many hours of experience operating the Bell 206B at night. According to the National Transportation Safety Board, the cause of the accident was deemed controlled flight into terrain, as Brown could not see the hill due to low visibility. Aftermath Vaughan's death triggered an outpouring of grief around the world. The album Family Style, the only collaboration recorded with his brother Jimmie, was released in September 1990 and became Stevie Ray Vaughan's best-selling non-Double Trouble album. On August 30, 1990, Vaughan was buried at Laurel Land Memorial Park in Dallas. Funeral services were held, with over 1,500 people attending and 3,000 more outside the chapel. His fianc√©e, Janna Lapidus, Jimmie and Martha Vaughan were in attendance. Among the other mourners were Stevie Wonder, Buddy Guy, Dr. John, ZZ Top, Eric Clapton, Bonnie Raitt, Jackson Browne and Nile Rodgers.Crossfire, pp. 263‚Äì64 Omniflight, the company that owned and operated the helicopter, was sued for negligence by Martha and Jimmie Vaughan. They claimed that pilot Jeff Brown operated the helicopter recklessly under visual flight rules while in instrument meteorological conditions. The lawsuit ended in a settlement. The widows of Clapton's bodyguard, Nigel Browne, and assistant tour manager, Colin Smythe, received more than $2 million in settlements. Memorials and tributes Jimmie Vaughan later co-wrote and recorded a song in tribute to his brother and other deceased blues guitarists titled \\"Six Strings Down\\". Bonnie Raitt's 1991 album Luck of the Draw was dedicated to him. Many other artists recorded songs in remembrance of Vaughan, including Eric Johnson, Tommy Emmanuel, Buddy Guy, Steve Vai, Ezra Charles, White Lion and Wayne Perkins. Stevie Wonder, whose \\"Superstition\\" Vaughan covered, honored him with \\"Stevie Ray Blues\\" on his 1995 live album Natural Wonder. Musicians such as Joe Bonamassa,Chappell, p. 251 John Mayer, Robert Randolph, Kenny Wayne Shepherd,Gregory, p. 153 Mark Tremonti, Chris Duarte, Colin James,Kitts, p. 76 Los Lonely Boys, Mike McCready, Eric Johnson, Orianthi, John Petrucci, and Doyle Bramhall IIGregory, p. 150 have cited Vaughan as an influence.

Almost nothing remains of Sturgeon Bay. It was located on the south shore of Sturgeon Bay, an indentation of Lake Michigan, just west of where Sturgeon Bay Trail and Lakeshore Driveintersect. Intersection is Sturgeon Bay Trail and Lake Shore Drive. M-119 terminates approximately four miles to the south of this intersection at Cross Village. See Wikipedia entry for M-119 for correct information on the northern terminus of M-119. The first mill was founded by Albert B. Klise in 1895, and a small town grew up around it. It was a large- scale operation that deemed a logging railway necessary. A railroad, Sturgeon Bay Railway, was built from the shore of Lake Michigan east about to within of Levering.State of Michigan Department of Conservation, County Maps, 1950 The railroad was standard gauge and was known to operate at least two Shay locomotives: SN 1984, built by the Lima Locomotive Works in 1907, the same year the railroad was built, and SN 155, built by Lima Locomotive Works in 1886. The inventor of the Shay Locomotive, Ephraim Shay, was a local in the area, living in Harbor Springs about to the south. They were also known to have operated a Heisler logging locomotive. A visible remnant of the railroad grade is one quarter mile east of the Sturgeon Bay Trail and M-119 intersection. The grade was used for the power lines from this point out to Lake Michigan, and the grades can be seen at many places in the area. The grade was still included on state surveyor maps as late as 1957. A post office was established on March 28, 1908, with Edward Ringler as postmaster. The U.S. Geological Survey gives the location as . The office operated until December 15, 1912. The town once boasted a saw mill, blacksmith shop, small general store, and a boarding house in addition to the post office. The exact date the mill closed is unknown, but it occurred sometime in 1913. Whether it was intentionally dismantled or was simply swept away by time is not known. Only a handful of known photographs of the town survive. The date the railroad was pulled is also unknown, but it was likely before 1920. A few dock pilings are still visible from the air, but most of the town was reclaimed by the sand dunes on which it was built. Albert Klise was the mayor of the city of Petoskey, Michigan, when a fire destroyed much of the village of Cross Village, on September 27, 1918. Sturgeon Bay, now an abandoned logging village, and still under the ownership of the mayor, was offered to many of the 300 homeless people to use as shelter. The beach in which this town was located is now home to the endangered piping plover, with many sections of the shoreline roped off to protect its nesting sites.

Of the current bridges, the millrace bridge was built about 1800 as a single stone arch, using stone from a local quarry upstream. It spanned the head race for Hayes Mill. A four-arch stone bridge over the Brandywine replaced the 1789 wooden structure in 1826, also using local stone. From the 1980s to 2002, PennDOT put forth a series of plans for the replacement of both bridges by a single modern structure.

Opened in 1886, it is the southwestern terminus of the San Benedetto del Tronto‚ÄìAscoli Piceno railway, a branch of the Adriatic railway. The station is managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). The commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni. Train services are operated by Trenitalia. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company. Location Ascoli Piceno railway station is situated at Piazza della Stazione, to the east of the town centre. History The station was opened on 1 May 1886, together with the rest of the San Benedetto del Tronto‚ÄìAscoli Piceno railway. The original operator of the station was the Societ√† per le Strade Ferrate Meridionali (SFM) (), which operated the whole of the Ascoli Piceno branch as part of the Rete Adriatica (). The SFM continued to operate the branch until the nationalization of the Italian railways in 1905. Features =Passenger Building= Ascoli Piceno's passenger building is a two-storey structure, comprising three sections. It is made of brick and painted brown. The central section of the building has six mullioned windows topped by arches, and its first floor windows are decorated with cornices. The ground floor of that section houses services for passengers, but the first floor is not accessible to the public. Extending laterally from the central section are two symmetrical single-storey wings. =Station yard= The station yard consists of three tracks dedicated to passenger transport. In detail: *Track 1: is a siding track. *Track 2: lines up directly with the running track. *Track 3: is another siding track. The tracks are all passing tracks, because although the station is the terminal, each track ends about outside the station. All tracks have a platform, and are connected by a concrete walkway. Only one track is covered by a canopy, which is made of wrought iron. The station yard is also equipped with a group of sidings dedicated to the storage of vehicles not in service. These sidings are connected with the platforms by a bridge. There is a locomotive shed, and a goods shed of a design typical to Italian railway stations. The former goods yard has been dismantled, and the goods shed is disused. From the station yard, a number of spur lines extend to nearby industrial sidings. Some of these spur lines are made partially of tramway tracks, at points where the line previously intersected with asphalt covered roadway. Train movements Only regional trains stop at the station. Their main origins and destinations are San Benedetto del Tronto, Civitanova Marche and Ancona. Interchange In the square in front of the passenger building is a bus terminal for urban and suburban buses. The operator of the bus service is START.

They were conceived by screenwriter David Gerrold, and first appeared in a 1967 episode titled \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\". They are depicted as a small, furry, gentle, attractive, and slow-moving but rapidly reproducing lovable species. Though they appear infrequently on-screen, they have become a popular feature of the Star Trek universe, featuring in their own eponymous official card game, and even lending their name to a conserved family of proteins that was first identified in the fruit fly as a regulator of cell division.Tribbles entry on Interactive Fly database NM Museum of Space History) Representation Tribbles were first shown in an episode of the second season of the original series, \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\" (1967). They have appeared in several subsequent series, in brief appearances in four Star Trek films, and in video games such as Star Trek: Armada II. A fan-made tribble According to Star Trek canon, tribbles are native to the planet Iota Geminorum IV. While they appear as small bundles of fur with no other visible features, they do produce cooing and squeaking noises. Their coloring ranges from white and grey to black, as well as speckled brown, yellow, and orange. According to Dr. Leonard McCoy's dialogue, their only two purposes in life appear to be to eat and to reproduce, and they perform both of these functions exceptionally well. McCoy concludes that tribbles use over 50% of their metabolism for reproduction and that they are born pregnant. Due to their tendency to over- populate, Starfleet considers tribbles to be dangerous organisms and forbids their transportation. A creature genetically engineered to hunt tribbles was introduced in the animated episode \\"More Tribbles, More Troubles\\" (1973). The Klingons, in whose presence tribbles produce a convulsive, shrieking reaction, consider them \\"mortal enemies\\", as stated in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode \\"Trials and Tribble-ations\\" (1996). The Star Trek: Short Treks episode \\"The Trouble with Edward\\" reveals that tribbles were not originally \\"born pregnant\\", and in fact their reproductive rate was exceedingly slow. A Starfleet scientist, Edward Larkin, genetically engineered them into their current form, in an attempt to solve a planetary food shortage. The experiment went disastrously wrong, resulting in Larkin's death, the destruction of his ship (overrun by tribbles), and the subsequent evacuation of the planet they were trying to save. Also, some tribbles managed to reach Klingon space, also with disastrous results. Origin David Gerrold has written that his original idea for tribbles was based on the well-known parts associated with the overpopulation of rabbits in Australia. He wanted a creature prop that would be cheap to produce and took inspiration from a ball of pink fuzz attached to a key ring. The name for tribbles was originally \\"fuzzies,\\" but to avoid confusion with the 1962 H. Beam Piper novel Little Fuzzy, Gerrold brainstormed some nonsense words, arriving at \\"tribble\\". Shortly before the episode was produced Kellam de Forest Research pointed out the similarities between Gerrold's creatures and the martian flat cats from Robert A. Heinlein's novel The Rolling Stones (1952),:p.271 and recommended purchasing the rights to the novel. Instead, Star Trek producer Gene L. Coon contacted Heinlein by telephone and asked that he waive the similarity. Heinlein did, but later regretted the decision when the Star Trek franchise continued to use tribbles in their productions. Gerrold discusses the matter of potential inadvertent plagiarism in his 1973 book, The Trouble with Tribbles, but he does not admit to it. He claims that instead of money or credit, Heinlein asked only for a signed copy of the script, and that afterwards Heinlein wrote to him dismissing the similarity, ‚Äúwe both owe something to Ellis Parker Butler...and possibly to Noah.‚Äù:p.274 However, Gerrold's account does not agree entirely with Heinlein's own recollection of the matter as related in private correspondence cited in his authorized autobiography. Reception In 2007, WIRED magazine noted the Tribbles, as one of the top ten classic, cheesy creatures of Star Trek.

Other semi regular customers include L.M. Windpower (Windmill blades) and Rail GD, in New Richmond, a company who specializes in heavy diesel engine repair and rail equipment refurbishment. Ciment McInnis, located in Port Daniel, is now also a regular customer although shipments have to be trucked to New Richmond and transloaded into railcars due to pending track and infrastructure repair. Origins The railway which runs along the Gasp√© Peninsula was originally constructed under two holding companies, the Quebec Oriental Railway, which owned the line between Matap√©dia and New Carlisle, and the Quebec, Atlantic and Western Railroad which owned the line from New Carlisle to Gasp√©. In 1918, ownership of the line was transferred to the newly formed Canadian Government Railways. The 98 miles of track between Matap√©dia and New Carlisle became known as the Cascapedia Subdivision whereas the 104.2 miles of track between New Carlisle and Gasp√© became known as the Chandler Subdivision. Ownership of the line was transferred to Canadian National Railways on 6 June 1919. New Carlisle remains the division point between the two subdivisions and historically housed the majority of the crew base for the entire line. As such a seven track yard was constructed there, as well as a wye for turning trains and once contained a small locomotive and car shop. A large station was also built there in 1948 with an upstairs level built to house offices for train dispatchers. The eastern terminus at Gasp√© also contained a yard, small engine and car shop, a wye, bunkhouse and a large station. All the remains in Gasp√© today is the station and wye. Pulp and paper mills constructed at New Richmond and Chandler provided the bulk of the traffic for the line with numerous other smaller businesses receiving rail service along the entire route. The copper mine and smelter at Murdochville also provided constant rail traffic for many years, with copper ore and mining supplies being hauled by rail to Sandy Beach (Gasp√©) before being trucked the rest of the journey to Murdochville. Declining traffic - 1996 to present Due to declining traffic, as well as CN's divestment in rural branchlines following privatization in 1996, the entire line was sold to the Quebec Railway Corporation (reporting mark; QRC) on 1 December 1996. The QRC established the Chemin de fer Baie des Chaleurs (Chaleur Bay Railway, reporting mark; CBC) as a holding company for the line. Operating rights were shared by the New Brunswick East Coast Railway and sister company Chemin de fer de la Matap√©dia et du Golfe. 1998 brought the closure of the Noranda Copper Mine in Murdochville. The company continued to operate the smelter at a loss until 2002, hauling in ore concentrate by rail to Sandy Beach and exporting refined copper ingots. In 2002 the Gasp√©sia Paper Mill in Chandler closed, effectively ending any regular freight service east of New Richmond. In 2006, the Smurfit-Stone boxboard plant in New Richmond shut down, putting an end to any regular freight service east of Nouvelle. Today, regular freight service on the line serves the Temrex sawmill in Nouvelle-Ouest and has been extended again to New Richmond as Ciment Mcinnis is now transloading cement from there. 1997 sale of 50 miles of the Chandler Subdivision Major declines in traffic on the eastern end of the Chandler Subdivision (milepost 44.1 to 104.2) caused the CBC to divest itself of the 50 mile section of line east of Chandler. This section of line was purchased by the local MRC's to preserve the rail corridor on 16 June 1997. A holding company named the Soci√©t√© de chemin de fer de la Gasp√©sie was formed to own this section of track, with operating rights subcontracted onto the NBEC and CFMG railways. 2007 purchase of CBC In 2007, QRC sold the remainder of its subsidiary Chemin de fer Baie des Chaleurs and the associated rail line from Matap√©dia to Chandler to the Soci√©t√© de chemin de fer de la Gasp√©sie. The only exception to SFG owning the entire line to the junction at Matap√©dia was that the wye in Matap√©dia and of the Cascapedia Subdivision east of the wye were retained by Quebec Railway Corporation. These tracks were transferred to the Chemin de fer de la Matap√©dia et du Golfe. 2008 sale of the Quebec Railway Corporation On 3 November 2008 CN announced that it was purchasing the QRC, including the New Brunswick East Coast Railway and Chemin de fer de la Matap√©dia et du Golfe, for $49.8 million (CAD). As a result of this purchase, CN became the SFG's direct interchange partner at Matap√©dia. SFG sub-contracts track and signal maintenance as well as rail dispatch service to RailTerm. 2009 Infrastructure Program In 2009 the SFG and its owners, the four MRCs, reached an agreement with the Government of Canada and Government of Quebec for several million dollars in funding for infrastructure improvements on the railway line between Matap√©dia and Gasp√©. This funding was targeted at improving track and bridge infrastructure to allow SFG to carry heavier freight railway cars and to improve track speed for passenger trains. In winter 2012 the rail line was closed after inspections revealed that several bridges required additional work and SCFG and the municipalities requested an additional $95 million over five years from the provincial and federal governments to complete the upgrades necessary to maintain track speed and freight car loading weight.Save the rails!Le r√©seau ferroviaire de la Gasp√©sie doit √™tre sauvegard√© On May 14, 2012 SCFG reopened the Cascapedia Subdivision of the Gasp√© line, which runs from Matap√©dia to New Carlisle, after 5 months of work. The section between New Carlisle and New Richmond was later taken out of service again due to needed bridge repairs. As of April 2018, the Chandler Subdivision, which composes the eastern half of the line from New Carlisle to Gasp√©, was still closed for repairs as well. Passenger service on the Gaspe Railway Passenger service had been provided by CN using a mix of conventional passenger train as well as rail diesel cars, locally known as \\"Sputnik\\" cars as CN 118/119, known as \\"The Chaleur\\", which ran daily Monday to Saturday until the creation of VIA Rail Canada in 1978. Initially, VIA Rail Canada was running a mix of ex-CN coaches hauled by leased CN-RS-18's as VIA 118/119. In 1980 VIA cancelled 118/119 and replaced it with VIA Rail Canada 621/622, consisting of two rail diesel cars running Monday to Saturday. On 29 May 1983 VIA Rail Canada replaced 621/622 with a full trainset, now operating under VIA Rail Canada 16/17 running Monday to Saturday. On 15 January 1990 VIA Rail Canada cut the passenger rail service from six day a week to three. The train was known as the passenger service or \\"The Chaleur\\". Suspension of VIA Rail service In 2011 an inspection of several of the bridges on the line revealed serious structural problems with the bridge over the Grande Pabos River near Chandler on 14 December 2011. As a result, the last passenger service went to Gasp√© on 10 December 2011. On 22 December 2011 the twin bridges over the Grande Cascapedia River were embargoed until repairs were completed. The passenger service was temporarily replaced by buses. A full train set would return in 2012 as far as New Carlisle after repairs to the Grand Cascapedia bridges were completed. Due to further issues on the Chandler Subdivision, including a washout just east of the tunnel at Port Daniel, as well as structural flaws in the Haldimand Bridge near Douglastown, VIA again returned to a bus service on 13 August 2013. On 17 September 2013, the last bus traveled to Gasp√© when VIA cancelled its services on the Gasp√© Peninsula until further notice. The future of passenger service on the Gasp√© coast remains uncertain. 2015 sale of the SFG During the winter of 2015, SFG encountered financial difficulties due to declining revenues and went into receivership. The entire line and all of SFG's assets were put up for sale by April. In May, the provincial government of Quebec purchased the railway line and oversees all maintenance on the line under MTQ (Quebec ministry of transport). All other assets were retained by SFG after Quebec purchased the rail line and still take care of railway operations and light maintenance work under contract for the Province of Quebec. For the short term, the section of the Cascapedia Subdivision between Matap√©dia and New Richmond is maintained and upgraded to ensure regular freight service. The section of the Chandler Subdivision between Perc√© and Gasp√©, will be maintained and upgraded for use by L'Amiral Tourist Train. This work was not completed as of 2017. The central section between New Richmond and Perc√© requires major bridge repairs. A washout near mile 25 just east of the tunnel at Port Daniel during the summer of 2015 renders passage east of mile 25 impossible until repairs can be made. Equipment roster SFG owns six 1800 hp RS-18u locomotives, numbered 1819, 1821, 1849, 1856, 1865 and 1868. They were originally built by the Montreal Locomotive Works in 1957-1958 and transferred to the Quebec Railway Corporation in 1998. 1819, 1849 and 1856 were purchased from the New Brunswick East Coast Railway and 1865 was purchased from the Ottawa Central Railway. 1821 and 1868 were purchased from the Charlevoix Railway who in turn had purchased them from the New Brunswick East Coast Railway. SFG also owns several pieces of maintenance equipment, including several flat cars, Difco side dump cars, Hart ballast hoppers, two snow plows, and three Pyle regulator type snow plows. All of their maintenance equipment was originally owned by CN and came from the New Brunswick East Coast Railway, Chemin de fer de la Matap√©dia et du Golfe and the Chemin de fer Baie des Chaleurs. The railway also owns a small number of ex-AMT, nee-GO single level coaches as well as two ex-AMT, nee-CN steam generator cars converted for use as HEP generators. L'Amiral tourist train In July 2013, the SCFG inaugurated a tourist train called L'Amiral along portions of the line. During the 2014 tourist season, the train ran between Perc√© (L'Anse-√†-Beaufils) and Gasp√©. Service was suspended in 2015 for track repairs and has not yet been reinstated. The tourist train consists of two ex-AMT, nee-CN steam generator cars converted for use as HEP generator cars, three ex-AMT, nee-GO single level coaches, all painted for the tourist train. RS-18u 1849 was also retrofitted and painted for use with the tourist train.

Work He founded Shanti Bhavan with Robert Antoine in 1950, and contributed much to make it a living centre of intercultural and interfaith dialogue. Ten years later he founded a similar Shanti Sadan in a much poorer and crowded area of North Calcutta, and later, after the sudden death of Louis Winckelmans took charge of Shanti Nir (1978), in the southern suburbs of the city. He was an educationist of renown, but also took charge of charitable work for the famine-stricken and refugees. For 25 years he was a much appreciated and highly respected professor of French literature at the University of Calcutta, where he also became a member of the senate and the academic council. He also taught at St. Xavier's College, Calcutta. He was much in demand as a public orator in Bengali, French and English. But his heart was in translations from the Bible and other texts for Christian worship in Bengali. His \\"Glossary of Bengali Religious Terms\\" (1945) had prepared him for the task of translating biblical and liturgical texts.\\"Avant-propos\\" 10.

Alongside the larger Coves dels Drach (\\"Cavern of the Dragon\\"), the Coves Dels Hams contribute to the cavernous tourist attractions in the eastern region of the island.  Description  The caves were discovered on 2 March 1905 by Pedro Caldentey. The caves lie along the route between the regional capital of Manacor and the coastal town of Porto Cristo. Like Coves dels Drach, the Coves Dels Hams hold an underground lake, which is known as \\"The Sea of Venice\\". The caves get their name from the unique formations of the stalactites and stalagmites. Hams is the Mallorqu√≠ (local dialect of Catalan) word for fishhooks or harpoons. Scientists have yet to explain the cause of these unique formations. Lorenzo Caldentey, a son of the discoverer, is a certified diver and has outfitted the caves with an electric lighting system for performances and tours. Multilingual tour guides lead visitors on a roughly 500 meter walk through 12 different areas of the caves. Currently the visitors also enjoy the \\"Magical Mozart\\" concert accompanied by a light show. The musicians navigate the \\"Sea of Venice\\" in a small rowboat with candle-lit railings.

The term was coined in the 1990s, although similar brewpubs existed during the 1980s. Etymology The term \\"gastropub\\" (derived from gastronomy) was coined in 1991, when David Eyre and Mike Belben took over The Eagle pub in Clerkenwell, London. Traditionally, British pubs were drinking establishments and little emphasis was placed on the serving of food. If pubs served meals they were usually basic cold dishes such as a ploughman's lunch. The concept of gastropubs largely redefined both pub culture and British dining, and has occasionally attracted criticism for potentially removing the character of traditional pubs. \\"Pub grub\\" expanded to include British food items such as steak and ale pie, shepherd's pie, fish and chips, bangers and mash, Sunday roast, ploughman's lunch, and pasties. In addition, dishes such as hamburgers, chips, lasagne and chili con carne are now often served.Better Pub GrubMirror.co.uk In August 2012, \\"gastropub\\" was added to Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary. History The Fox in Dalston, London In 1984 Spinnakers Brew Pub opened in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. The first ever custom-built brewpub in Canada, it heralded a new wave of brewpubs and craft breweries in British Columbia that followed a major deregulation of the brewing industry in that province.http://blogs.theprovince.com/2014/05/15/spinnakers-at-30-how-canadas- first-brewpub-diversified-to-thrive-part-1/ Spinnakers served inventive cuisine, and Joseph Blake of Eat magazine claims it as the world's oldest gastropub.Blake, Joseph, \\"Victoria's Pub Revolution\\", Eat (Vol 18, No 5, October 2014), pp 14-15 (http://issuu.com/garyhynes/docs/eat_magazine_september___october_20). The gastropub phenomenon took off in the United States in the early 1990s at gastropubs such as Dhillons by Chef Matt Dhillon in Las Vegas. Later, there were such places as Dev Dugal's The Redwood Bar in downtown Los Angeles; Red Table in Huntington Beach, California; and restaurateur and chef Sang Yoon's Father's Office,LA WeeklyTime Out which had what Esquire magazine called one of the best burgers in the world.

It is a popular venue for events and various activities in the summer time. History Barth√©lemy de La Rocque: View of Blaagaard, c. 1745 The square takes its name from a country estate, Bl√•g√•rd (English: Blue House), which was established at the site by Christoffer Gabel in the middle of the 17th century on the grounds of a former brickyard. Later owners included Ulrik Frederik Gyldenl√∏ve, Prince Charles and Peter von Scholten. Anker Heegaard's iron foundry In 1827 the owner obtained a license from King Frederick VI to convert the property into an iron foundry. From 1852 to 1889, Copenhagen's old fortification ring was gradually decommissioned and the area began to undergo rapid urbanization, becoming one of the densest and poorest parts of the city. Kai Nielsen photographed at the square in 1916 The foundry's highly polluting activities posed a severe health hazard and the neighbourhood became known as the Black Square (Danish: Den Sorte Firkant). In 1898 the City acquired the property to turn it into a public space. The first square was laid out in 1902, enclosed by two rows of large-leaved Linden trees. In the 1980s, the old buildings on two sides of the square were demolished and replaced by new houses. Buildings Bl√•g√•rd Church The building to the left of the church (No. 8-10), built 1900-1902 Bl√•g√•rd Church is located on the north side of the square. It was built in 1926 to a design by Andreas Clemmensen and Johan Nielsen, replacing a temporary church by Martin Nyrop from 1905. The church is flanked by two buildings from circa 1900. The buildings on the two other sides are from the early 1980s. Kai Nielsen sculptures The space is dominated by 22 granite figures integrated in a low granite wall enclosing a depressed, rectangular section in the centre of the square. Designed by sculptor Kai Nielsen in collaboration with the architect Ivar Bentsen, they depict people plying a trade--a tailor, a cooper, a barber and a baker etc.--all in the company of a toddler. In the corners stand larger figure groups depicting playing children. Bl√•g√•rds Plads today With a community centre, a library and several popular caf√©s, Bl√•g√•rds Plads is a focal point for the life of the surrounding neighbourhood which is still known as the Black Square. The depressed central section serves as a football field in summer and features an ice-skating rink in winter.

It was designated by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission on October 13, 2009, and includes twelve mid-19th century rowhouses on the north side of West 29th Street from number 333 on the east end to number 355 on the west end. \\"Lamartine Place\\" was a name given to the street by the developers, William Torrey and Cyrus Mason, in order to give their project an identity distinct from the Manhattan street grid. The name honored the French writer, poet and politician Alphonse de Lamartine, who was instrumental in the foundation of the French Second Republic. As part of their efforts, Torrey and Mason constructed a park on the east end of the block, between 28th Street - which they were also developing as \\"Fitzroy Place\\" - and 29th Street. The park, which was called Lamartine Park, enhanced the desirability of the townhouses as homes, and this name and Lamartine Place appeared on maps until 1902. Wanting the same kind of continuity of design they have achieved at their earlier development at London Terrace on 24th Street between Ninth and Tenth Avenues, Torrey and Mason included covenants which limited the types of buildings that could be built on Lamartine Place. The units they built and sold were all Greek Revival rowhouses with consistent heights and setbacks; most of these were completed by 1849, while seven buildings at the western end were not finished until around 1852. Most of the buildings that remain today have been altered since, often with Renaissance revival elements.

He had no intention of creating a new schedule from scratch, but he wanted a more topical and a more varied flavour - to make Radio 4, in his words, like a \\"well-labelled library that has a few surprises in it\\". So, in 1970, along came the unashamedly serious Analysis and the magisterial World Tonight, the bright and breezy 'commuter magazine' PM Reports and a phone-in called It's Your Line, the satirical sketch-show Week Ending, and the consumer magazine You and Yours.A year of anniversaries on Radio 4, David Hendy, 6 October 2010 In 1972, Whitby commissioned the first series of I‚Äôm Sorry I Haven‚Äôt a ClueI‚Äôm Sorry I Haven‚Äôt A Clue, and in 1973 Kaleidoscope. In 2010, David Hendy, lecturer in broadcasting history at the University of Westminster, said: > \\"Looking back, what's most striking about Whitby's revolution of 1970 is how > genuinely eclectic it made Radio 4, with programmes stretching across a > suddenly wider spectrum, from the intellectually demanding or disturbing at > one end to the faintly scurrilous or comforting at the other. The changes 40 > years ago set Radio 4 on its long-term trajectory: away from the dusty tones > of the somewhat middlebrow old Home Service, to the tougher, livelier, more > authoritative, network we have today\\". Whitby also wrote several plays under the pseudonym Tony Lesser. His wife was Joy Whitby, known for her work in children's television.Samira Ahmed \\"Joy Whitby: a life spent telling children's stories on TV\\", The Daily Telegraph 1 February 2013 He died at age 45, after a long illness.

Polycystic ovary syndrome causes more than 75% of cases of anovulatory infertility. Pathophysiology Not all women with PCOS have difficulty becoming pregnant. For those who do, anovulation is a common cause. The mechanism of this anovulation is uncertain, but there is evidence of arrested antral follicle development, which, in turn, may be caused by abnormal interaction of insulin and luteinizing hormone (LH) on granulosa cells. Endocrine disruption may also directly decrease fertility, such as changed levels of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, gonadotropins (especially an increase in luteinizing hormone), hyperandrogenemia, and hyperinsulinemia. Gonadotropins are released by gonadotroph cells in pituitary gland, and these cells appear to harbor insulin receptors, which are affected by elevated insulin levels. A reason that insulin sensitizers work in increasing fertility is that they lower total insulin levels in body as metabolic tissues regain sensitivity to the hormone. This reduces the overstimulation of gonadotroph cells in pituitary. Diagnosis PCOS usually causes infertility associated with anovulation, and therefore, the presence of ovulation indicates absence of infertility, though it does not rule out infertility by other causes. =Ovulation prediction= Ovulation may be predicted by the use of urine tests that detect the preovulatory LH surge, called ovulation predictor kits (OPKs). However, OPKs are not always accurate when testing on women with PCOS. Charting of cervical mucus may also be used to predict ovulation, or certain fertility monitors (those that track urinary hormones or changes in saliva) may be used. Methods that predict ovulation may be used to time intercourse or insemination appropriately. Women with PCOS often ovulate at any time during their cycle, to best increase chances of conceiving it is best to have intercourse at least every other day during the 2nd and 3rd week after their period ends. Ovulation may also be confirmed by testing for serum progesterone in mid-luteal phase, approximately seven days after ovulation (if ovulation occurred on the average cycle day of fourteen, seven days later would be cycle day 21). A mid-luteal phase progesterone test may also be used to diagnose luteal phase defect. Methods that confirm ovulation may be used to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments to stimulate ovulation. Basal body temperatures are not reliable for predicting ovulation. Management Management of infertility in polycystic ovary syndrome includes lifestyle modification as well as assisted reproductive technology such as ovulation induction, oocyte release triggering and surgery. =Lifestyle modification= For overweight women with PCOS who are anovulatory, diet adjustments and weight loss are associated with resumption of spontaneous ovulation. Preliminary evidence suggests that exercise may improve menstrual regularity, pregnancy and ovulation rates, but more research is needed. =Ovulation induction= For those who after weight loss still are anovulatory or for anovulatory lean women, ovulation induction to reverse the anovulation is the principal treatment used to help infertility in PCOS. Letrozole and Clomiphene citrate are the first-line treatment in subfertile anovulatory patients with PCOS. A Cochrane review showed that letrozole (an aromatase inhibitor) appears to improve live birth and pregnancy rates as compared to clomiphene citrate. There appeared to be no difference between letrozole and laparoscopic ovarian drilling. Gonadotrophins such as follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) are, in addition to surgery, second-line treatments. =In vitro fertilization= For patients who do not respond to diet, lifestyle modification and ovulation induction, in vitro fertilisation can be performed. This usually includes controlled ovarian hyperstimulation with FSH injections, and oocyte release triggering with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or a GnRH agonist. =Surgery= Surgery can be attempted in case of inefficient result with medications for ovulation induction. Though surgery is not commonly performed, the polycystic ovaries can be treated with a laparoscopic procedure called \\"ovarian drilling\\" (puncture of 4-10 small follicles with electrocautery), which often results in either resumption of spontaneous ovulations or ovulations after adjuvant treatment with clomiphene or FSH. =Inefficacy of metformin= Previously, metformin was recommended treatment for anovulation. A systematic review and meta-analysis in 2012 concluded that there is insufficient evidence to establish a difference between metformin and clomiphene citrate in terms of ovulation, pregnancy, live birth, miscarriage, and multiple pregnancy rates in women with PCOS and a BMI less than 32 kg/m2. It emphasized that a lack of superiority of one treatment is not evidence for equivalence. Another review in 2012 concluded that metformin improves pregnancy rates in women with PCOS when compared with placebo, and in addition to clomiphene compared with clomiphene alone, but not when compared directly with clomiphene. Also, however, it concluded that metformin does not improve live birth rates, whether used alone or in combination with clomiphene. It therefore concluded that the benefit of metformin in the improvement of reproductive outcomes in women with PCOS is limited. The ESHRE/ASRM-sponsored Consensus workshop does not recommend metformin for ovulation stimulation. Subsequent randomized studies have confirmed the lack of evidence for adding metformin to clomiphene. When taken prior to or during IVF, there is no evidence that metformin treatment improves live birth rate in women with PCOS. However, metformin was found to increase clinical pregnancy rates and reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) in women with PCOS and undergoing IVF cycles. Prognosis PCOS increases the time to pregnancy but does not necessarily reduce eventual family size. It does not appear to increase miscarriage frequency.

The park covers an area of , and borders on the Hofburg, the Kongresshaus, and the Tyrolean State Theatre. The Hofgarten was originally laid out on the site of a river meadow under the direction of Archduke Ferdinand II in the sixteenth century. At the time, it was one of the most elaborate gardens laid out north of the Alps. During its 600-year history, it was turned into a Renaissance garden, a French formal garden and, since 1858, an English landscape garden.Parsons 2000, p. 371. Its last conversion was conceived by Friedrich Ludwig von Sckell, but carried out four decades later by an unknown landscape designer who deviated significantly from Sckell's original proposal. The Hofgarten is managed by the Austrian Federal Gardens (√ñsterreichischen Bundesg√§rten), a subordinate department of the Ministry of the Environment (Bundesministerium f√ºr Land- und Forstwirtschaft, Umwelt und Wasserwirtschaft). Tiroler Kunstpavillon in the Hofgarten The Hofgarten is a recreation area within the Old Town with an interesting and varied stock of mature trees, a set of ponds, a modern children's playpark, a palm house, and a popular garden restaurant. The Hofgarten management is responsible for taking care of the park. It is notable that there are still plants in the park that were planted personally by the Austrian Empress, Maria Theresa. The Tiroler Kunstpavillon (Tyrolean Art Pavilion) in the middle of the park dates back to 1733. Today, the pavilion supports numerous events‚Äîmainly concerts. Chess tournaments are fought on the outsize chess boards next to the pavilion. There is a lawn for sunbathing in the Hofgarten with a children's playpark. Otherwise walking on the ornate lawns is not permitted because they are susceptible to excessive use. The palm house contains a comprehensive collection of about 1,700 species of plant, which may be viewed mostly on working days. During the temporary art and sculpture exhibitions in the summer season the palm house may also be visited at weekends. References ;Citations ;Bibliography  Frenzel, Monika (1998).

The school was established in 1903 1905 Year Book of the Seventh-day Adventist Denomination, p. 98 in Lorne Park (a community to the west of Toronto, now part of Mississauga) by Eugene Leland and his wife, and was then known as Lornedale Academy, and had eight students from Grades 1‚Äì9. By 1907, the enrollment had grown to 40 students.Statistical Report of Seventh-day Adventist Conferences, Missions, and Institutions For the Year Ending December 31, 1907, p. 12 In 1911, Lornedale had become a high school, serving grades 7-12, which led to a need for more space and equipment. The school began looking for a new site, and the present site in Oshawa (east of Toronto) was acquired. The school was renamed Buena Vista Academy, and opened in 1912. The school quickly grew. In 1914, it became a Union Conference school. In 1916, it became a junior college with fourteen grades, and its name was changed to Eastern Canadian Missionary Seminary. In 1920, the school was incorporated, leading to another name change, this time to Oshawa Missionary College. During the Depression years, enrollment decreased and some programs were discontinued, following which an improvement program was implemented in 1933. Enrollment decreased again during World War II, but following the war, the college enjoyed a period of expansion. In 1963, the school name was changed once more, to Kingsway College, reflecting a curriculum that included a complete academic program while decreasing the implication that the school was only a Bible college. In 1975, the Branson school of nursing was closed due to a change in nursing education policy by the Ontario government. This led to the decision to close the remainder of the college program and merge it with Canadian Union College in Alberta, leaving Kingsway strictly a high school. Since then Kingsway College has followed the ups and downs that have come with the Ontario education system, including the phasing out of OAC in 2002. Lornedale Academy 1903 - 1912 An Overview Kingsway College \\"had its birth not at Oshawa, but in a beautiful fruit farming section, about fifteen miles west of Toronto. In 1903, the officers of the Ontario Conference opened the first academy in this part of Canada in a farm house at Lorne Park. As the academy grew, a large addition was made to the house, making it into quite a convenient dormitory, with the necessary class rooms, and chapel. For nine years Lornedale Academy at Lorne Park was the Adventist educational centre for Ontario, and also well patronized by our members in Quebec.\\" Historical Sketch by M.V. Campbell, Canadian Union Messenger, June 27, 1933, pp. 16, 17 =1904= Lornedale Academy Publishes the Canadian Union Messenger The executive committee of the Canadian Union Conference of Seventh-day Adventists voted to turn over to the management of the Lornedale Academy the printing, editing and mailing of The Canadian Union Messenger.The Canadian Union Messenger, September 15, 1904, p.4 Thus began a unique and practical educational venture. In September, the academy installed a printing plant on campus and the school's work of publishing the Messenger began under the supervision of principal Leland.The Canadian Union Messenger, October 1, 1904, p.4 For the December 8 issue of the Messenger, Eugene Leland reported that the type-setting, the press-work, and the editorial work was done almost entirely by students who, three weeks ago, had never been in a printing office before. All the students helped with preparing the Messenger for mailing. The principal then took the papers to the post office. Mr. Leland observed, Christ's Object Lessons as a Fund-raiser for the School An Informal Minority Meeting of the General Concerence Committee of Seventh-day Adventists met at Takoma Park, Maryland on July 19, 1904. A.G. Daniells, W.C. White, and W.W. Prescott, and, by invitation, I. H. Evans, discussed the need of establishing a training-school in the Ontario Conference. Evans had recently attended the annual camp-meeting for Ontario. They took this action: The 5th annual session of the Ontario Conference held June 16‚Äì26, 1904, dedicated the last of their seven meetings to the work of selling Christ's Object Lessons,Read Christ Object Lessons online at this link. a book by Ellen G. White. At this last meeting, 55 people pledged to sell 1,251 books. The conference appointed T. H. Robinson to oversee the sales of the books. The months of October, November, and December, of 1904, were \\"set apart among all our people to especially prosecute this work.\\" Review and Herald, July 28, 1904, p. 17 Ellen White relates how her book Christ's Object Lessons came to be linked to the financial support of Adventist schools, The School Farm Sunday Laws and the School Farm On, August 15, 1904, Charles Sweeten and Fred Boettger, both employees on the Lorne Dale Academy farm, were summoned to appear before the Magistrate in answer to a complaint made against them for working on the Lord's day. At the time of the trial, the defense attorney failed to show. Charles Sweeten did not want to proceed without his attorney. However, the Crown attorney demanded his pay for the day plus the pay for the attendance of the large number of witnesses he had called. This was unacceptable to Mr. Sweeten, so the trial began. Principal Eugene Leland helped present a defence of \\"not guilty\\" for the two accused men. As the trial proceeded, the witnesses were unclear in their testimony as to what they had seen. The only witness put on the stand who could bear positive testimony was a member of the Adventist church, a young girl who had been employed at the farm picking berries. She reluctantly testified that Sweeten was in the patch on the day specified and was carrying berries. Elder Leland's defense was that the 1845 law did not include 'farmers'. Both Bro. Boettger and Bro. Sweeten were put on the stand and testified that they were farmers. Elder Leland concluded his defence by stating some principles involved in Sunday laws in general and showing that there was no Bible authority for Sunday observance. The Magistrate made some remarks which convinced the Academy men that they would be convicted. He expressed sympathy for \\"this people\\" because he believed they were sincere, but he \\"did not believe that anybody had a right to set a day apart different from the majority of people, on which to worship, but should conform to the day on which the majority worshipped.\\" The trial was adjourned until the August 25th for a decision.Canadian Union Messenger, September 1, 1904, p. 4 The September 8, 1904 edition of the Review and Herald reported: =1905= The second term of the school year 1904-05 opened on January 11 with eighteen in attendance. All the old students returned bringing others with them.The Canadian Union Messenger, January 19, p. 3 A. O. Burrill observed, \\"If all the people in our conference could look in and hear some of the recitations, they would soon feel that this is the place for their youth.The Canadian Union Messenger, January 26, 1905, p. 3 The churches supported their school. The church in St. Thomas presented the school with \\"a beautiful parlor wood stove\\".Canadian Union Messenger, February 9, 1905, p. 3 The winter term closed with a special program held in the parlor. President Burrill attended. The principal made a few remarks then nearly all the students took part with recitations and musical selections. Some were upon the coming of the Lord, while others were upon the Sabbath, conversion, the love of God, and other subjects. Burrill considered the papers good enough for use in giving Bible studies in people's homes. \\"Only think, these are the children of the Ontario churches. These young people have been getting this knowledge by studying in our own school. My heart rejoiced as I listened. Of Jesus it is said that he shall see of the travail of his soul and be satisfied. I can say that when I had heard and seen, my heart was well paid for all that I have tried to do to help the school. It has been the money donated by the brethren and sisters, and that received from the sale of Christ's Object Lessons that has made it possible for this school to exist. Those who have toiled to get means to place this school where it is, will rejoice to know that their labors have not been in vain. Principal Eugene Leland applied his creative mind to the work of education. The school organized a regular class in \\"Object Lessons\\" in the Spring term, presumably the course included the teaching of sales skills, a marketing class. As a result, they \\"hoped to see a lively interest awakened among the young people in the sale of this book.\\" Canadian Union Messenger, April 27, 1905, p. 3 He asked of his readers, \\"What would the friends and patrons of the school think of organizing a class in giving treatments, and employing a trained nurse as teacher? The way seems to be opening up very providentially for this kind of instruction to be given.\\" Brother Herbert Knister took charge of the school farm. \\"He is up with the lark and at it all day.\\" Hospitality The Academy became a stopping point for travelling Adventists. The living quarters and cafeteria did not turn them away, but the expenses needed to be covered. After presenting the problem, A.O. Burrill writes: =1906= The Academy provided strong out of the classroom life experiences for the young people attending. The January 4, 1906 edition of the Canadian Union Messenger reports that the printers gave up their vacation to help with the religious liberty work. This was the time of considerable political interest in Sunday legislation. These students gave up their Christmas vacation to help. In the same edition the Messenger reports on a wedding that took place in the Academy parlor: Buena Vista Academy 1912 - 1916 =Overview= \\"Toward the end of that period (Lorne Park years) it became quite evident that still more commodious quarters would have to be provided. It was also felt that there should be more land to provide the young men with farm work to assist them in earning their way through the academy. As it did not seem practical to purchase more real estate in Lorne Park, nor to add further to the buildings it was decided to survey the field for some central point, with good railway service, where a modern academy building could be erected, which would have a good-sized farm connected with it. In 1911, Lornedale had become a high school, serving grades 7-12, which led to a need for more space and equipment. The school began looking for a new site, and the present site in Oshawa (east of Toronto) was acquired. The school was renamed Buena Vista Academy, and opened in 1912. The school quickly grew. In 1914, it became a Union Conference school. =1912= \\"When the time arrived to open the academy for the year 1912-13, the first year at Oshawa, quite a large number of students arrived, but there were no arrangements to house them properly. The academy building was just nicely started. The little, square building behind it was used as the dining room, kitchen, chapel, classrooms, and in the basement was the laundry and cannery. The young ladies were taken care of fairly well in the stone house, but there was no near-by place to house the boys. Most of them roomed in the farm house, (now, 1933, Brother Brown's home), but several lived in tents on the campus. One or two of the boys continued to camp long after the ground was covered by a deep blanket of snow. Each student privileged to attend during that first year still treasures the memories of the joys as well as the hardships which were the common lot of the pioneer students of \\"Buena Vista Academy.\\" The school was located on 235 acres with six buildings. They offered grades 5-12. Enrollment: 4 in elementary school, 25 in high school.Seventh-day Adventist Conferences, Missions, and Institutions.

In the year 1914 it was called upon to serve a still wider area. The Maritime Conference had a ten-grade academy at Williamsdale, and it was decided to make Oshawa a continuation school for the Maritime graduates. The Eastern Canadian Union Conference at this point took over the management of the academy from the Ontario Conference, and Buena Vista Academy became a union institution. The following year the General Conference honored the academy by making it the official training centre for French workers.\\" M.N.

FIFTY- SECOND Annual STATISTICAL REPORT, Year Ending December 31, 1914 1915 In 1915, four students graduated from Beuna Vista Academy; three from the academic program and one from the Elementary Normal Course. The March 16 academy board meeting voted to establish a French department in anticipation of the relocation of the church's education for French workers from South Laucaster to Oshawa. Also, in order to facilitate the training of school teachers, the board voted to establish a \\"model\\" elementary school in connection with Beuna Vista Academy. Eastern Canadian Missionary Seminary 1916 - 1920 In 1912, the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists encouraged the Eastern Canadian leadership to plan for an educational system that would train workers for Canada. They gave a significant appropriation for the building of a training school at Oshawa and authorised for the school to develop up to the fourteenth grade if required. The General Conference leaders had noticed that if Canadian young people went to the United States for their education, they seldom returned to work in Canada. This deprived the Canadian church of its most talented young people. In many cases the rest of the family followed the young people to the States. Thus the Canadian field was constantly being weakened.Campbell, M. N. Biennial Address of the President of the Eastern Canadian Union Conference Eastern Canadian Messenger, January 18, 1916, p. 2 A resolution passed in January, 1916, at the biennial session of the Eastern Canadian Union Conference addressed the need for a new name for the school. The name Buena Vista Academy didn't represent the work being done the school. The session voted that the name Buena Vista Academy be changed to Eastern Canadian Missionary Seminary.Eastern Canadian Union Messenger, February 1, 1916, p. 1 Each year the enrollment increased. Shortly after the war closed it was decided to build a new administration building. The old academy building became a dormitory with a cafeteria on the ground level. A large building was put up with a spacious chapel, classrooms, library, and offices. This building resolved any space problem caused by the growing enrollment. Next, a woodworking plant began operations. By 1933, six to ten boys earned their way through college each working there. \\"Perhaps the greatest asset of all to the college was the location of another denominational institution beside it. At about the time the administration building was erected, the Canadian Watchman Press put up its factory a few hundred yards away. Throughout its history, the press has given students desirous of earning their way through college, the preference in its employment. Scores of students during the past few years have been enabled to get a Christian education, and enter denominational work as a result of employment during their college years at the press.\\" Oshawa Missionary College 1920 - 1963 =1920 - 1934= 1920 In 1920 the college was incorporated in Ontario under the name 'Oshawa Missionary College,' OMC. Church leaders chose this name for its brevity, dignity, and practicality. It communicated the location and the purpose of the school. Lawrence Huntley, 1920 What kind of student attended Oshawa Missionary College? The Eastern Canadian Messenger, June 22, 1920,Eastern Canadian Messenger, June 22, 1920, p.1 reported on the death of Lawrence Huntley. The account of this young man's life provides a window into school life and the kind of students who attended OMC. Lawrence Huntley (1900-1920) grew up on a farm in Scotts Bay, Nova Scotia located next to Cape Split on the Bay of Fundy. He attended Williamsdale Academy, near Truro, Nova Scotia,Williamsdale Academy was one of the early Canadian Adventist schools (1904-1920). It was moved to Memramcook, New Brunswick and renamed Maritime Academy (1921-1932). After graduating from Williamsdale, he came to Oshawa and attended what was then known as the Eastern Canadian Missionary Seminary. He graduated from the Seminary's academic course in 1918 and would have completed Oshawa Missionary College's Pre-Medical course a week after he died. He drowned trying to rescue some other students, May 20, 1920, in Lake Ontario, near Oshawa at the school's annual picnic. His plan was to attend the College of Medical Evangelists at Loma Linda, California. 1933 The Seventh-day Adventist Church in Canada's official periodical, the Canadian Union Messenger, published a special edition focusing on the denomination's two Canadian post-secondary institutions, Canadian Junior College in Alberta, and Oshawa Missionary College in Ontario.Canadian Union Messenger, June 27, 1933 M.V. Campbell, in his Historical Sketch article in that 1933 edition summarized the contribution of the school: \\"Oshawa Missionary College, under its several previous names, has been training workers for this cause for the past thirty years. An army of ministers, missionaries, Bible workers, church school, academy, and college teachers, are now in active service who received their instruction under its auspices. It is still living up to its motto: \\"Service‚Äînot Fame,\\" and is anxious to serve a still greater number of students as the years go by, until its work on earth is accomplished and our Saviour returns.\\" During the Depression years, enrollment decreased and some programs were discontinued, following which an improvement program was implemented in 1933. =1934 - 1963= Enrollment decreased again during World War II, but following the war, the college enjoyed a period of expansion. Kingsway College 1963 - Present In 1963, the school name was changed once more, to Kingsway College, reflecting a curriculum that included a complete academic program while decreasing the implication that the school was only a Bible college. 1964, Terrance S. Carter reports the finding of the 1964 Ontario court case 'Oshawa Missionary College v City of Oshawa' with regard to qualifying for tax-exempt status under s.3 of the Assessment Act In 1975, the Branson school of nursing was closed due to a change in nursing education policy by the Ontario government. This led to the decision to close the remainder of the college program and merge it with Canadian Union College in Alberta, leaving Kingsway strictly a high school. Since then Kingsway College has followed the ups and downs that have come with the Ontario education system, including the phasing out of OAC in 2002.

She won her World Championships in both sculling and sweep-oared boat classes. Club and state rowing Bradley was educated at Penrhos College, Perth where she took up rowing. She won the national Schoolgirl Scull title at the Australian Rowing Championships in 1997. She was first selected to represent Western Australian, age fifteen, in the 1996 youth eight competing for the Bicentennial Cup at the Interstate Regatta within the 1996 Australian Rowing Championships. From 1997 she was competing for Australia in crewed sculls but was still eligible for state youth eight selection as late as 2000 and she raced again in Western Australian youth eights at Australian Championships in 1999 and 2000. Bradley's senior rowing was done from the Edith Cowan University Perth Rowing Club. She was selected in representative Western Australian senior women's eights competing for the Queen's Cup in the Interstate Regatta at the Australian Championships on seven consecutive occasions between 2000 and 2007. She stroked those eights in 2004, 2006 and 2007. From 2001 to 2006 she was also Western Australia's senior sculling representative contesting the Nell Slatter Trophy at those same Australian championships. She won the single sculls championship in 2001, 2003 and 2004. In ECU Perth Rowing Club colours she contested national titles at the Australian Championships on a number of occasions. She won the U19 single sculls title in 1996 and the U23 single sculls titles in 1999 (racing for the AIS). From 2002 to 2004 she was the Open Australian singles sculls champion and she also raced in that event in 2005, 2007 and 2008. International representative rowing Aged 16 Amber was selected as the Australian junior single sculls contestant for the 1997 World Rowing Junior Championships in Hazewinkel.Bradley at World Rowing She fought through the preliminary rounds with a second in the heat and a third place in the semi. However she raced a perfect final, leading at every mark and by 4 seconds at the 1500 m. She saw off a strong finish from the French sculler to take the gold and win her first World Championship. In 1998 she was selected in a development quad who competed at the Rowing World Cup III at Lucerne. At the U23 World Rowing Championships in Ioannina, Greece she raced in a double scull with Jess Morrison and finished eighth. In 1999 she figured in Australian senior squads and was picked in the quad scull who represented at the 1999 World Rowing Championships in St Catharines' who struggled to an eleventh place finish. In 2001 she was selected in the quad scull to race at the U23 World Rowing Championships in Linz, Austria where she won another under age World Championship title. She also raced in quads at two World Rowing Cups in Europe that year. In 2002 Bradley secured a seat at stroke in the Australian women's quad scull with Donna Martin, Sally Robbins and Dana Faletic. They raced at the 2002 World Rowing Cup III in Munich and then went to Seville 2002. They were slow in their heat but won the repechage to make the final and finished fourth overall. The 2003 World Rowing Championships were the main Olympic qualification regatta and the Australian women scullers trained in Canberra under Lyall McCarthy. Faletic and Bradley held their seats in the quad with the experienced Jane Robinson and the young Tasmanian Kerry Hore added to the crew. The quad performed well in the lead up winning at the World Rowing Cup III in Lucerne. At the 2003 World Championships in Milan they won their heat in an impressive time. They sculled the final to perfection leading at every mark. At the 1500m they had an unbeatable 3.45 second margin and finished more than 2 seconds ahead of Bulgaria. The quad won the gold and Bradley at stroke claimed her first senior World Championship title. The World Champion quad with Jane Robinson replaced by Rebecca Sattin were still together for the 2004 Athen Olympics. They were fourth across the line in the final. After the medals had been presented it was discovered that a member of the third-placed Ukrainian crew failed the drugs test and Australia was elevated to the bronze medal position and Amber won her only Olympic medal. In 2005 Bradley rowed consistently in the Australian double scull with Queenslander Sally Kehoe who was at the beginning of her own stellar career. They placed at two World Rowing Cups that year and then won the bronze at the 2005 World Rowing Championships in Gifu, Japan. 2006 saw Bradley switch from sculls to sweep- oared boats at the national representative level. She raced in a coxless pair and in the Australian women's senior eight at the World Rowing Cups I and II in Munich and Poznan. She was in the three seat of both the eight and the four for the 2006 World Rowing Championships at Eton, Dorney. The eight took the bronze and in the four with Jo Lutz, Robyn Selby Smith and Kate Hornsey, Bradley won the gold and her second senior World Championship title. In 2007 Bradley was sculling again and raced in the Australian quad at a World Rowing Cup and then in a double-scull with Kerry Hore who placed ninth at Munich 2007. Her final Australian appearances were in the Olympic year 2008 when she raced in the quad at two World Rowing Cups ahead of final role in the two seat of that boat who finished sixth in the final at Beijing 2008.

Selby honed his hunting skills early in life while working for the Safariland safari company and under the tutelage of legendary hunter Philip Percival. During his time with Ker & Downey Safaris, he also met and befriended Robert Ruark, whose subsequent writings about safaris he did with Selby made Selby famous around the world.  Early life  Born in Frankfort, South Africa, Selby was very young when his family moved to Kenya. His parents had acquired 40,000 acres of prime ranch land ‚Äì with a view of Mount Kenya - where they grazed cattle. The land was also home to big game, and as a child he was surrounded by herds of zebra, eland and impala. From time to time groups of buffalo and elephant passed through the property, and occasionally lions or leopard. The presence of the big cats would spark a hunt in order to protect the livestock, and at the age of just eight years old he was entrusted with his own single-shot .22 rifle. Selby's early pursuits kept the family's larder stocked with guinea fowl, francolin and gazelle and it was during these times that he perfected his gun handling skills. He became familiar with dangerous game while hunting smaller game on the slopes of Mount Kenya. He hunted with experienced local trackers; expert hunters in their own right who would pursue even the largest game with bow and arrow.  Hunting career  Selby's career as a hunter emerged from a job as a field mechanic for Philip Percival, a veteran East African white hunter. However, it was not long before Percival realized that Selby's personable nature and considerable big game experience would be invaluable on safari. Percival took Selby on as his apprentice, and by the time Selby turned 22 he was already well on his way to becoming one of Africa's most respected professional hunters. = Robert Ruark = In 1949, when Harry was just 24, he joined Ker & Downey Safaris Ltd. Two years later he was teamed with a guest who was to change his life. Robert Ruark was an American newspaper columnist who flew to Africa to fulfil a lifelong dream to go on safari. He was so enthralled that he wrote a book called Horn of the Hunter which Field and Stream magazine called \\"very arguably, the best book on African hunting ever written\\". It also put Harry's name in the history books, and created a demand to hunt with Selby so great that he became fully booked years in advance. In 1955 Ruark wrote a subsequent book called Something of Value, a fictional novel influenced by Harry's colonial Kenyan childhood and his Professional Hunter exploits. The attention placed great pressure on Harry, who later commented that creating his reputation was easy ‚Äì maintaining it for 40 years was the hard part. = Moving to Botswana = By 1962 the future of hunting in Kenya was looking uncertain. Selby had been offered a directorship in what became Ker, Downey & Selby Safaris, and he agreed to open a new venture in Bechuanaland. He recognised the area's tremendous potential and in 1963 he, his wife and two children moved to Maun to begin a new chapter in their lives. The company leased a vast 12,000 km¬≤ concession on the northwest edge of Botswana, near Chobe National Park. The principal landmark of the area is the Khwai River, and he could not resist building a bridge over it just a couple of years later. In 1970, fuelled by the burgeoning interest in East African photo safaris, Selby built Belmond Khwai River Lodge, the first photographic lodge in Botswana to cater to overseas photo safari tourism. In 1997, after completing his 53rd safari season, Selby throttled back from the demands of full-season hunting, and finally retired from professional hunting in 2000 at the age of 75. Harry Selby died in Maun, Botswana on January 20, 2018 at the age of 92.

New Science Projects is known for their bizarre make-up, which depicts all of the band members as severely injured and bleeding. The reasoning behind this has never been answered with clarity. Dale Jones speaks on behalf of the rest of the band, and is notorious for his on-stage persona, including his thick, ambiguous, Eastern European accent, though Jones states that his stage persona is no specific character with any particular origin. Jones' mannerisms seem distant and apart from the present; while he is very charismatic, much of his banter is juxtaposed, with multiple conflicting topics being spoken about at any given time, while other speeches very frequently trail off before their conclusion.

Early Life Tarek Naga was born in 1953 in Cairo, Egypt. He is the elder brother of Egyptian actor and film maker Khaled Abol Naga. He obtained a Bachelor of Architecture from Ain Shams University in 1975 and a Masters from the University of Minnesota in 1982. He is based in America, where he has lived since 1979. He has published works on architecture and has taught in America and been a guest academic at the American University in Cairo. He regularly enters design competitions. He has created installations for exhibitions and has been involved in a variety of ongoing design projects in Egypt and Dubai. Architecture Initially trained in traditional architectural styles, Naga found these unsatisfactory and wanted to \\"get out of this box, look for other possibilities -- something much more substantial than just a continuation of the same kind of style, variations and abstractions of certain variations, Eastern or Western, Islamic or not, Mies van der Rohe or whoever was trendiest‚Ä¶\\" In Egypt in the mid 1970s, Naga found himself in an environment in a state of flux and his design philosophy was challenged by market forces driven by the need for housing. When the opportunity arose, he applied to go to America with two other academics and after an interview he was accepted. After touring the US and meeting leading architects, visiting universities and architectural firms he was offered a teaching position at the University of Minnesota. He attained his master's degree and moved to the University of Pennsylvania where he remained for three years working on a dissertation for a doctorate. He did not complete the doctorate but valued the process of research and reflection in addition to the opportunity to teach. He took up a position at the Architects' Collaborative in Boston but found that it resembled the traditionalism he had rejected in Egypt where \\"tradition was so heavy you could not liberate yourself from it.\\" Naga formed his own firm in 1991, which is based in Los Angeles. He has exhibited designs internationally in events in France, Japan, and America. He described Architecture as \\"a discipline engages a much wider range of topics that concern society in a certain evolutionary process, like philosophy, the arts, the sciences‚Ä¶\\" His design philosophy incorporates a desire to create \\"an architecture that would transcend the traditional historical evolution of architectural 'style,' which is becoming, really, increasingly irrelevant.\\" =Projects in Egypt= Panoramica Dahshur In 2010 Naga worked on a joint initiative of a variety of International and Egyptian agencies including \\"the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the World Tourism Organization (WTO), the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), the International Labor Organization (ILO), and the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).\\" at Dahshur, Egypt. The project aimed to protect and develop the historical Dahshur site while creating a sustainable management plan for the area and employment for the local community. Naga and his team documented historical evidence at the site, and created a database of each monument at the location. Naga participated in the first TEDxCairo, delivering a presentation entitled: \\"Of Phantom limbs: Sycamores, Towers, and the Return of the Prodigal Son\\" at the American University in Cairo. In 2010 he designed a \\"Muramid\\" for the Art Miles Project to commemorate the International Day of Peace. The \\"Muramid\\" consisted of a floating pyramid structure.

Cambridge University scholar Geoffrey Hawthorn wrote: \\"Alfredo Toro Hardy has a rare and distinctive voice. No-one can come away from his essays without seeing the world in new ways\\".

Schematic initial progression of Lewy body deposits in the first stages of Parkinson's Disease, as proposed by Braak and colleagues. B. Localization of the area of significant brain volume reduction in initial PD compared with a group of participants without the disease in a neuroimaging study which concluded that brain stem damage may be the first identifiable stage of PD neuropathology. Positive Alpha-Synuclein staining of a Lewy body in a patient with Parkinson's disease. Braak staging refers to two methods used to classify the degree of pathology in Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. These methods are used both in research and for the clinical diagnosis of these diseases and are obtained by performing an autopsy of the brain. Parkinson's disease The main pathological characteristic of Parkinson's disease is cell death in the substantia nigra. In particular, this death occurs in the ventral part of the pars compacta, with up to 70% of the cells affected by the time the patient dies. The mechanisms by which the brain cells are lost are varied. One mechanism consists of an abnormal accumulation of the protein alpha-synuclein bound to ubiquitin in the damaged cells. This protein accumulation forms inclusions called Lewy bodies. = Braak's theory = The staging in Parkinson's disease was described by Heiko Braak in 2003. Braak and colleagues state that Parkinson's disease begins when a foreign agent enters the body via the nose or gastrointestinal system and travels into the central nervous system (CNS). The presence of Lewy bodies in the enteric and peripheral nervous systems supports their claim. This Lewy body pathology selectively travels through the CNS, targeting thin and largely unmyelinated neurons. Braak et al., therefore, developed a staging system that characterizes disease progression. This system is divided into six different stages, with each stage being attributed to abnormal pathology in particular neurological structures. In terms of symptomatology, the type and severity of symptoms is correlated to progression through the Braak stages. Early stages are characterized by non-motor symptoms, such as a lessened sense of smell or constipation. Motor symptoms are often displayed around the mid-stage state, and cognitive symptoms arise as later Braak stages are reached. Braak and colleagues further state that the disease begins in the enteric nervous system and gains entry to the CNS through the vagus nerve.  Stage 1  Braak Staging: Yellow represents the origin of Parkinson's pathology. Pink/purple represent Stages 1 and 2. Blue represents Stages 3 and 4. Orange represents Stage 5. Yellow represents full neocortex engagement and Stage 6. The disease begins in structures of the lower brainstem and the olfactory system. In particular, the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve in the medulla oblongata and anterior olfactory nucleus are affected. Lewy neurites, thread- like alpha-synuclein aggregates, are more prevalent than globular Lewy bodies in this stage.  Stage 2  In addition to the pathology observed in Stage 1, Stage 2 is characterized by additional lesions in the raphe nuclei and gigantocellular reticular nucleus of the medulla oblongata. The disease then moves up the brainstem, traveling from the medullary structures to the locus ceruleus in the pontine tegmentum. Similar to Stage 1, Lewy neurites outnumber Lewy bodies.  Stage 3  At the beginning of Stage 3, the disease has entered the substantia nigra and Lewy body lesions begin to form in the pars compacta. The latter half of this stage involves disease progression into the basal nucleus of Meynert, a cluster of acetylcholine-rich neurons in the basal forebrain. Further, structures affected in Stages 1 and 2 begin to develop more Lewy bodies.  Stage 4  Stage 4 is characterized by severe dopaminergic cell destruction in the pars compacta. There is also mesocortex and allocortex involvement; the neocortex remains unaffected. In particular, pathology can be observed in the amygdala and in the subnuclei of the thalamus. There is significant damage done to the anterior olfactory nucleus.  Stage 5  The disease has started to invade the neocortex and spreads into the structures of the temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes. Cell death can be observed in the substantia nigra, the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve, the gigantocellular reticular nucleus, and the locus ceruleus.  Stage 6  The disease has fully invaded the neocortex, affecting the motor and sensory areas in the brain. The disease is at its most severe. Alzheimer's disease Abnormal accumulation of tau protein, which constitutes neurofibrillary tangles, in neuronal cell bodies (arrow) and neuronal extensions (arrowhead) in the neocortex of a patient who had died with Alzheimer's disease at Braak stage VI. The bar = 25 microns (0.025 millimeters). Staging in Alzheimer's disease was described by Braak in 1991. Braak stages I and II are used when neurofibrillary tangle involvement is confined mainly to the transentorhinal region of the brain, stages III and IV when there is also involvement of limbic regions such as the hippocampus, and V and VI when there is extensive neocortical involvement. This should not be confused with the degree of senile plaque involvement, which progresses differently.

The Testament of Ba (Tibetan ‡Ωë‡Ωñ‡Ω†‡ºã‡Ωñ‡Ωû‡Ω∫‡Ωë or ‡Ω¶‡æ¶‡ºã‡Ωñ‡Ωû‡Ω∫‡Ωë; Wylie transliteration: dba' bzhed or sba bzhed) is an account written in Old Tibetan of the establishment of Buddhism in Tibet and the foundation of the Samye Monastery during the reign of King Trisong Detsen (r. 755‚Äì797/804), reputedly as recorded by Ba Salnang (Tibetan ‡Ωë‡Ωñ‡Ω†‡ºã‡ΩÇ‡Ω¶‡Ω£‡ºã‡Ω¶‡æ£‡ΩÑ or ‡Ω¶‡æ¶‡ºã‡ΩÇ‡Ω¶‡Ω£‡ºã‡Ω¶‡æ£‡ΩÑ; Wylie transliteration: dba' gsal snang or sba gsal snang), a member of the king's court. The earliest known versions of the text are two manuscript fragments dating to the 9th or 10th centuries that are held at the British Library.  Versions of the text  The Testament of Ba was transmitted in manuscript form over many centuries, and so there are many different recensions of the text, but not one single, canonical printed version. Two early versions of the text have been identified by scholars: * A manuscript in 31 folios discovered in Lhasa in 1997, titled Dba' bzhed (with a 'd' prefix to the Ba clan name), that is thought to be a revised copy of an 11th-century manuscript, and which was published in facsimile with an English translation in 2000; * Three manuscripts titled Sba bzhed (with an 's' prefix to the Ba clan name), one of which dates to the 12th century, that were used as the basis of an edition published in Beijing in 1980. The Testament of Ba is also widely quoted in later Tibetan historigraphical works, for example the Scholar's Feast (mkhas pa'i dga' ston). The author of the Scholar's Feast calls the Testament the Rba bzhed (with an 'r' prefix to the Ba clan name), and refers to 'genuine', 'impure', 'large' and 'medium' versions of the text. A later, expanded version of the Testament of Ba, titled Sba bzhed zhabs brtags pa (Supplemented Testament of Ba), was produced during the mid 14th century. A manuscript copy of this text was published with a summary in French by Rolf Stein in 1961. Up until 2009 it was thought that the Testament of Ba dated back to no earlier than the 11th or 12th century, and therefore its composition may not have been contemporaneous with the late 8th century events that it recorded. However, in 2009 Sam van Schaik of the British Library realised that two Tibetan manuscript fragments catalogued amongst the Chinese manuscripts of the Stein collection (and consequently previously overlooked by Tibetan scholars) preserved a section of the Testament of Ba relating to the arrival of the Indian monk ≈öƒÅntarak·π£ita, abbot of Nalanda University, to Lhasa: * (6 lines) * (1 line) These two fragments came from the 'Library Cave' at Dunhuang, which was sealed in the early 11th century, and so pre-date all of the other known versions of the Testament of Ba. Van Schaik dates the fragments to the 9th or 10th centuries. The text of the British Library fragments is very close to that of the Dba' bzhed manuscript discovered in Lhasa in 1997, but has some differences that suggest that it represents an earlier recension of the Testament of Ba. Most notably, in the British Library fragments the king is concerned that the foreign monk may have brought evil spirits with him, and so ≈öƒÅntarak·π£ita is confined in the Jokhang and interrogated for three months through an interpreter called Ananta. However, the Lhasa manuscript softens the language, politely asking ≈öƒÅntarak·π£ita to stay at the Jokhang rather than having him forcibly confined there.  Bibliography  * Stein, R. A. 1961.

It is Oxford's only surviving independent cinema, showing a mixture of independent, mainstream, foreign language, and classic films. The cinema has been a Grade II listed building since 1994. History Frank Stuart opened Oxford's first cinema, the Electric Theatre, in Castle Street, in 1910. He was the licensee of the Elm Tree pub on the corner of Cowley Road and Jeune Street. Also in 1910 work started to build Stuart's second cinema on land in Jeune Street behind the Elm Tree. It opened on 24 February 1911 as the Oxford Picture Palace. In 1917 the manager was conscripted to serve in the First World War. The cinema was closed and stood unused for many years before being turned into a furniture warehouse. In 1976 Bill Heine and Pablo Butcher reopened the cinema as the Penultimate Picture Palace. They added a sculpture of Al Jolson's hands by John Buckley to the fa√ßade. The first film to be shown was Winstanley. Under the new management the cinema gained a reputation for showing an eclectic and provocative range of films that set it apart from the mainstream cinemas of the time. In 1994 Heine closed the Penultimate Picture Palace. For a month that summer it was squatted by the Oxford Freedom Network, which reopened it as Studio 6 Cinema. Then brothers Saied and Zaid Marham bought it and spent ¬£40,000 restoring the neoclassical fa√ßade. They reopened it as the Ultimate Picture Palace in June 1996. The auditorium before the 2014 refurbishment In the 2000s the cinema got into debt. In July 2009 Saied Marham sold it to Philippa Farrow and Jane Derricott, who installed a small refreshment bar in the northwest corner of the auditorium. In 2011 Farrow and Derricott sold the cinema to Becky Hallsmith. In 2014, as a result of a successful Kickstarter Campaign, Hallsmith had the auditorium refurbished with new seats. Becky Hallsmith died in September 2018. A committee has since been investigating the potential for turning The Ultimate Picture Palace into a community-owned cinema.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The church stands to the south of the town of Basildon, just north of the A13 road. History The earliest parts of the church date from the 12th century, and additions have been made since that time. The last major change was in 1837 when the west wall was rebuilt and a gallery was added. In 1890 the box pews were replaced by benches. The church was declared redundant in 1996 and vested in the Churches Conservation Trust in January 2003. Repairs were necessary because the structure of the church had deteriorated over the years, and in more recent years it had been vandalised. These were undertaken in two phases. In the first phase, starting in April 2004, the building was stabilised and made weatherproof. The second phase has included repairs to the interior of the church, replacing doors and windows, dealing with cracks in the walls, rebuilding the stairway leading to the rood loft, conserving the wall paintings, repairing the nave ceiling and removing the chancel ceiling, and restoring the bellcote. Architecture The church is constructed in ragstone and flint, with a tiled roof. Its plan is simple, consisting only of a nave and chancel, with a bellcote at the west end. The bellcote is constructed in timber, with weatherboarding and a shingled pyramidal roof. In the south wall of the nave are the remains of a Norman window, and a 15th-century door.

She was designed to be lighter than traditional Spanish vessels which had had difficulty matching the speed of ships of the Royal Navy. Though nominally a 74-gun ship San Ildefonso actually carried 80 cannons and howitzers. She saw service against French and British vessels in the late 18th century, sailed twice to the Americas and was trapped in Cadiz by the British blockade. San Ildefonso was captured by the British third-rate at the Battle of Trafalgar and successfully weathered the storm afterwards to be taken into Royal Navy service as HMS Ildefonso.  Design  San Ildefonso has been described as a technical milestone in 18th-century Spanish shipbuilding. Having fought the Royal Navy in various wars the Spanish admirals were concerned that their ships could not match equivalent British vessels for speed. San Ildefonso incorporated many amendments from traditional Spanish designs in order to improve her speed. Instead of traditional iron bolts holding the hull together the vessel utilised much lighter wooden treenails, the upper parts of the ship were made from pine and cedar instead of oak to reduce weight and lower the centre of gravity and the vessel was constructed shorter in length than a traditional Spanish seventy-four would be. Though considered a seventy-four (or third-rate) ship, in common with other vessels of the time, San Ildefonso actually carried more guns. She was equipped with 80 in total comprising 16 eight-pounder cannons on the fore-deck and 6 eight-pounder cannons, 10 thirty- pounder howitzers and six twenty-four pound howitzers on the aft deck. However, unlike most other Spanish ships of the line (including all those present at the Battle of Trafalgar), San Ildefonso did not carry any four- pounder anti-personnel \\"pedrero\\" cannons.  Spanish service  San Ildefonso was designed by Romero Landa and built by J. Fdz. Romero de Landa at a yard in Cartagena. She was ordered on 23 February 1784 with her keel being laid down a little over a month later. She took ten months to build, being launched on 22 January 1785. She began a forty-day sea trial period on 19 August 1785 but shortly afterwards was disarmed at Cartagena and placed in reserve for two years and nine months. San Ildefonso was refitted in 1788 and underwent more trials before being placed into reserve once more in October of that year. She was reactivated again in April 1789 and made a cruise to Cadiz in August, becoming damaged on the way. San Ildefonso underwent a third period of reserve later that year before being reactivated and having her interior layout rearranged. San Ildefonso then sailed on campaign against the French and British navies for four years beginning in 1793. She returned to port at Cadiz on 3 March 1797 and was subsequently blockaded in that port by the Royal Navy. San Ildefonso sailed to America twice from 1798 to 1802 as an escort to convoys of galleons. During these voyages artillery officer Luis Daoiz de Torres, who would later lead the Spanish forces against French troops in the Dos de Mayo Uprising, served aboard the ship due to a shortage of trained naval officers. San Ildefonso was placed in reserve at Ferrol in 1802 for the last time in her career. After another period of refit in July and August 1805 she joined the main Spanish fleet prior to the Battle of Trafalgar. In her career to this point San Ildefonso had been in Spanish service for 21 years but had spent 9 of those years disarmed in reserve and had not fought any engagements. Capture and British service French and Spanish ships laid up at Gibraltar shortly after the battle of Trafalgar; Bahama, French Swiftsure, San Juan Nepomuceno and San Ildefonso At Trafalgar San Ildefonso and her commander, Commodore Don Jose de Varga, were captured by the British third- rate HMS Defence. Defence was at the rear of the British line and so joined the battle later than most other ships but had already dismasted the French 74-gun ship before engaging San Ildefonso. The Spanish vessel had already been damaged in the action and after a fierce fight lasting less than an hour surrendered to the British. Defence suffered only 34 casualties in return. San Ildefonso was successfully sailed to Gibraltar by the British, surviving the storm that followed the battle. She was taken into British service as HMS Ildefonso. Ildefonso was laid up at Portsmouth until 3 April 1806 when she was placed under the command of newly promoted Captain John Quilliam, a veteran of Trafalgar. The ship was paid off in Portsmouth on 19 June but recommissioned on 22 July 1808 under Captain Edward Harvey. She was decommissioned later that year and reduced to a victualling storeship in Portsmouth and, later, Spithead. Being obsolete and of no further use after the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars she was broken up in July 1816. =San Ildefonsos ensign= The naval ensign that San Ildefonso flew at the Battle of Trafalgar was hung in St Paul's Cathedral at Admiral Nelson's funeral on 9 January 1806.

Photo appeared in Nouvelle Iconographie de la Salp√®tri√®re, vol. 5. The Lee Silverman Voice Treatment ‚Äì LOUD (LSVT LOUD) is a treatment for speech disorders associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). It focuses on increasing vocal loudness and is delivered by a speech therapist in sixteen one-hour sessions spread over four weeks. A derivative of this treatment, known as LSVT BIG, is used in treating movement aspects of Parkinson's disease. Background Dr. Lorraine Ramig started Parkinson's Disease rehabilitation research in 1983 while serving as Assistant Professor on tenure track in the Department of Speech, Language and Hearing Science at the University of Colorado-Boulder. Dr. Ramig was approached by colleague Dr. Wilbur Gould who requested her assistance in treating a friend, Mrs. Lee Silverman. The Voice Treatment consisted of four weeks of rigorous therapy, entailing four one-hour sessions per week, with the goal of increasing patient's voice and speech abilities. Dr. Ramig officially founded the Lee Silverman Voice Treatment program LSVT Global in 1985 in honor of the first patient who died before research was officially published and recognized as a medical discovery. The foundation defines the processes of LSVT LOUD treatment with specific clinical exercises in speech therapy.LVST Global. \\"What Is LSVT LOUD?\\" LSVT Global. LSVT Global, n.d. Web. 25 Sept. 2015. The initial design of the project included \\"medical care, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, family support, nutrition and recreation,\\" according to Dr. Ramig,\\"LSVT History.\\" The National Center for Voice and Speech. The National Center for Voice and Speech, n.d. Web. 25 Sept. 2015. but Silverman's family challenged Ramig to create a design based only on speech so they could communicate with her better. Process of treatment The treatment is delivered during hour-long sessions with a speech-language pathologist, given four times a week for four weeks. These sessions stress the idea of \\"thinking loud in order to speak loud\\" and uses exaggerated motions and behaviors. Through video documentation, the patient's loudness is measured through a series of voice exercises using a decibel sound meter. In the two videos cited, both patients were asked to take a breath and say \\"Ahh\\" as long as they can. Targeting the vocal chords is a way of expanding the patient's capability of speaking more fluently despite the conditions of Parkinson's. In one video, the patient says \\"Ahh\\" in many scales (ascending and descaling), then goes on to functional phrases, and finally phrases that answer questions such as \\"I'm fine\\".\\"LSVT Speech Program.\\" Interview by Jenna Ann Lynn.

LSVT ‚Äì BIG A derivative of this treatment, known as LSVT BIG, is used by speech-language pathologist, physiotherapists, and occupational therapists to promote high-amplitude movements in people with Parkinson's disease. The quick, explosive movements characteristic of LSVT BIG are aimed at reversing one of four cardinal movement symptoms in PD, bradykinesia. The Berlin Big Study compared the effectiveness of three distinct exercise programs in people with mild to moderate Parkinson's disease. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either one-on-one LSVT BIG training, group Nordic walking training, or domestic unsupervised exercises. At the conclusion of the training period, the LSVT BIG group demonstrated a significant improvement in unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) motor score and 10-m timed up and go test timing compared with the Nordic walking and home exercise group.

Life William Wallace was personally tutored by his father, an Evangelical minister. He attended Dublin University in 1882, received a degree in divinity, and sought ordination in the Anglican tradition at the age of 24. He took up parish work in the Midlands in England, but, after an illness, returned to Ireland to recuperate. Two years later, he decided to become a missionary with the Church Missionary Society, and was appointed to Krishnagar, West Bengal, in 1889. Disillusioned with the Christianity practiced by his fellow Anglicans, he left the Mission quarters and took up residence in a little hut in Krishnagar where he devoted himself to the study of Bengali and Gaudiya Vaisnavism. His life of simplicity and seeking endeared him to his Indian neighbours. His contact with Bengali Hindus led him to the opinion that Protestant spiritualty was inadequate to meet the needs of his deeply spiritual Vaisnava friends. After serving seven years in Bengal, he returned to Ireland on home leave. There he made a study of Catholic doctrine and spirituality, and became convinced that only Roman Catholicism could provide him with the means of dialoguing with his Hindu associates, and that only Catholic spirituality was worth preaching to the Bengalis. Having been rejected by the Mill Hill Fathers, he requested admission to the Jesuit Order whose members were active in Bengal. He was accepted by the Belgian provincial and entered the novitiate on the 15 February 1898. Upon finishing the two years spiritual training in England, he arrived in Calcutta on 13 December 1901. He engaged in further studies in philosophy and theology at Shembaganur and St Mary‚Äôs, Kurseong before being appointed as a lecturer in English literature at St Xavier‚Äôs College, Calcutta. He was later sent to Darjeeling as lecturer and parish priest among the Anglo-Indians. It was at this time that he composed his autobiography, From Evangelical to Catholic by Way of the East, and also several works on Hindu philosophy and yoga. He wanted to make use of Indian philosophy to make an acceptable presentation of Christianity to the Hindus. With his health beginning to fail, he was transferred back to St Mary‚Äôs, Kurseong, in 1921. He died on 13 June 1922.For this whole section, see Sean Doyle, Synthesizing the Veda: The Theology of Pierre Johanns, S.J. (Bern: Peter Lang, 2006) 123-124. Significance Wallace‚Äôs significance rests on the influence he exerted upon his contemporaries and on younger Jesuits about the way mission was done in Bengal. He helped shift the mentality toward Indian spirituality among the Jesuits and influence the spiritual formation of the novices who were preparing for service in India. He entreated his superiors in Belgium to send their most talented scholastics to engage in the deep study of Hindu texts. Pierre Johanns and Georges Dandoy were fruits of this vision of Wallace. These St Xavier‚Äôs Jesuits ‚Äúproduced a durable synthesis of Catholicism and Hinduism.... The ‚ÄòBengal School,‚Äô which these came to be clubbed under, was the lasting contribution to India of Father William Wallace.‚ÄùUdayan Namboodiry, St Xavier‚Äôs: The Making of a Calcutta Institution (New Delhi: Viking/Penguin Books India, 1995) 116. The 'Bengal School' is also known as the 'Calcutta School of Indology'. Wallace was inspired by the efforts of Brahmabandhab Upadhyay and Animananda. With them he felt that Christianity had to be Indianized if it had to gain a successful hearing in Bengal. He had read Upadhyay‚Äôs articles in Sophia and had been impressed by his basic motivations. In his own writings, he reiterated Upadhyay‚Äôs approach regarding the suitability of Indian philosophy as a natural foundation for supernatural religion.For this section, see Sean Doyle, Synthesizing the Veda: The Theology of Pierre Johanns, S.J.

Background  Sultan ƒ∞brahim (reigned 1640‚Äì1648) of the Ottoman Empire was dethroned on 12 August 1648. Several days later he was killed. His 6-year-old son Mehmet IV (reigned 1648‚Äì1687) ascended the throne. It was a custom in the Ottoman Empire that the new sultan tip the soldiers () when he ascended the throne. However, due to the costly Cretan War ongoing, the regents of the sultan were unable to pay the required tip. The sipahi corps, the main cavalry units of the Ottoman Army, were especially complainant, for they were not paid soldiers.  The incident  Two months later, the Ottoman Porte, the government, decided to send sipahi units to Crete. The angry sipahis returned to ƒ∞stanbul to demand their tips along with some other rights. Some ƒ∞stanbul residents also joined them. They gathered in the square named Atmeydanƒ±, the Hippodrome from the Byzantine times, situated in front of the Topkapƒ± Palace.

Life Cole was born on 8 December 1753 at Mersham in Kent, and received in early life great assistance from a friend of his mother, John Chapman, archdeacon of Sudbury (1704‚Äì1784). Chapman sent him first to Ashford Grammar School (now The Norton Knatchbull School), and afterwards to a private seminary at Bierton, near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. In 1766 he was admitted at Eton College on the foundation, and in 1773 was made scholar of King's College, Cambridge, and fellow in 1776, proceeding B.A. in 1778, and M.A. in 1781. In 1777 he returned to Eton as a master, but, having ruptured a blood- vessel while an undergraduate, found himself not strong enough for the post, and resigned it in 1780 on being appointed tutor to George, Marquess of Blandford, and Lord Henry Spencer, the sons of the Duke of Marlborough, to whom he became chaplain. In 1781 he was inducted to the first portion of the rectory of Waddesdon, Buckinghamshire, on the presentation of the Duke of Marlborough, but resigned it in 1788, on being collated to the rectory of Mersham, Kent, by the Archbishop of Canterbury. In 1792 he was installed prebendary of Westminster, and in 1795 received the degree of D.D. by the archbishop's diploma at the archiepiscopal visitation at Canterbury. In 1796 he was presented to the vicarage of Shoreham, Kent, by the dean and chapter of Westminster. In 1795 he married Mary, the second daughter of Sir William Blackstone, but left no issue. He died on 24 September 1806, and was buried in the north aisle of Westminster Abbey.

Here, bus passengers transferred to the Nepal Government Railway (NGR) for their onward journey. Urban transportation In September 1959, Nepal Transport Service started a local bus service between Kathmandu and Patan (Lalitpur), one of the three cities in the Kathmandu Valley, marking the beginning of urban transportation in Nepal. The bus stop in Kathmandu was located at the northwestern corner of Rani Pokhari. In Patan, the bus made stops at Mangal Bazaar, Lagankhel and Jawalakhel before returning to Kathmandu. The route was later shortened to Patan Dhoka, or Patan Gate, on the edge of the city.Shrestha, Bijaya Lal (11 August 1989). \\"All Those Years Ago: A trip through the early days of bus transport\\", The Rising Nepal.

Dissolution Nepal Transport Service went out of business in 1966, no longer able to sustain the losses resulting from frequent downtime. Breakdowns were common due to bad road conditions. Major maintenance had to be done in India, and unavailability of spare parts locally for its diverse fleet meant its buses were out of commission for extended periods. During the company's final years, it fought an unsuccessful court battle over increasing income tax despite falling revenues as more and more of its aging buses went out of service.

In 1926 he changed his surname from Jensen to Dahl-Jensen. The son of a cabinet maker, he was initially apprenticed to a joiner in Aalborg and won a silver medal for his exemplary work. During this period he learnt to carve in wood and became interested in sculpture. From 1894 to 1897, Dahl-Jensen studied at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen. On his vacations he travelled to Berlin and Dresden. After his final academy examination, he did additional studies in Switzerland and Italy. In 1900 he married his wife Martha. From 1897 to 1917, he was a model master of the porcelain company Bing & Gr√∏ndahl in Copenhagen and from 1917 to 1925 he was the artistic director of the porcelain factory Norden, also Copenhagen. Between 1901 and 1925 Dahl-Jensen modelled numerous small sculptures of beasts of prey in bronze that were exhibited at Charlottenborg, Malm√∂, Berlin, Munich and San Francisco, but he became increasingly famous for his work in porcelain, especially animal figurines for Bing & Gr√∏ndahl. He was the busiest animal sculptor of his company, some of his Art nouveau figurines are still produced by Royal Copenhagen. In 1925 he started his own business, the Dahl- Jensen Porcelainfabrik, in Husum, a suburb of Copenhagen. It exported a lot, mainly to the United States and Italy. In addition to animal figures, he modeled some unusual oriental figurines with deep and strong lower glazes, from 1930 to 1958. His wife Martha Dahl-Jensen worked in the family and his son Georg Dahl-Jensen continued the production until 1981, the company closed after the sale of the stock in 1984.

Location  Brandy Bay is located about southeast of the ghost village Tyneham, south of Wareham and about west of Swanage. Admission to the beach of Brandy Bay is prohibited. Access is solely possible by foot from the South West Coast Path via Hobarrow Bay or by boat. The area around Brandy Bay is owned by the Ministry of Defence (MoD). Lulworth Ranges are part of the Armoured Fighting Vehicles Gunnery School at Lulworth Camp. The Range, which is more than lies within an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and stretches along the coastline between Lulworth Cove to just west of Kimmeridge. Because tanks and Armoured vehicles are used in this area, safety warnings about explosives and unexploded shells are posted around the area by the MoD, visitors are advised to keep to official footpaths and abide to local site notices.  History  Brandy Bay once had a Roman settlement, but the name derives from the frequent smuggling activities that were taking place here during the 17th and 18th centuries.  Geology  Geology of the coastline by Brandy Bay The geology of the Isle of Purbeck is very complex and this is shown very clearly along this stretch of coast. The extreme angular layers of rock seen in the cliffs visibly demonstrate the complex sedimentary folding that affected this area some 30 million years ago. The foldings were caused by the tectonic pressures as the African and European continents collided. During this period, the sediments were twisted horizontally, this is why the younger Cretaceous formations are found further back at the rear of Worbarrow Bay. Brandy Bay lies entirely within the Kimmeridge Clay Formation. Between Brandy Bay and Hobarrow Bay is a wide ledge of the dolomite (Flats Dolomite Bed) which is called Long Ebb.

Just before 1 pm, as the aircraft attempted to land at Marden Airfield, the pilot cut power to the engines at an altitude of . The aircraft then rose to an altitude of about and then stalled and crashed. A few seconds later, fire broke out in the wreckage of the airliner. One of the passengers managed to escape on his own. The pilot was pulled from the wreckage by one of the two mechanics. Villagers rushed to the aid of the victims, but the survivors had all escaped from the wreckage by the time the first of them arrived. Two of the passengers, who were returning from honeymoon in Paris, were killed. The injured were taken to the West Kent Hospital, Maidstone. An inquest was opened by the Cranbrook Coroner on 12 February at Pagehurst Farm, Staplehurst into the deaths of the victims. Witnesses gave evidence of the failure of the starboard elevator. The inquest was adjourned initially to 13 March in the expectation that the crew of the aircraft would be fit enough to attend. The inquest resumed on 28 March at Staplehurst. Evidence was produced to show that the aircraft was airworthy when it departed Paris, and that the actions of the crew were correct. The 1921-built aircraft had been completely overhauled and had returned to service in 1929, following the ditching in 1925. The cause of death in each case was shock and smoke inhalation. A verdict of \\"Accidental Death\\" was returned in both cases.

After having attended a visitation of the bishop of Tyre in the United States in 1920, he remained in the United States till 1934, serving the Maronite communities particularly in Indiana, Connecticut and California. He was elected Maronite bishop of Tyre on April 29, 1934 and consecrated on December 8, 1934 at Bkerk√© by Maronite Patriarch of Antioch, Anthony Peter Arida. His co-consecrators were Augustin Bostani, Eparch of Sidon, and Pierre Feghali, Titular bishop of Epiphania in Syria. He chose as episcopal motto Gloria Libani data est ei. Moran Mor Paul Peter Meouchi was elected patriarch of Antioch of the Maronites on May 25, 1955. He attended the I, II and III sessions of the Second Vatican Council, 1962‚Äì1965, where he took a stand to defend the rights of Patriarchs to discourage the emigration of Christians from the Middle East.

Background In the summer of 1955, Davis performed a noted set at the Newport Jazz Festival, and had been approached by Columbia Records executive George Avakian, offering a contract with the label if he could form a regular band.Richard Cook. It's About That Time: Miles Davis On and Off Record. New York: Oxford University Press, 2005. , pp. 44-45. Davis assembled his first regular quintet to meet a commitment at the Caf√© Bohemia in July with Sonny Rollins on tenor saxophone, Red Garland on piano, Paul Chambers on bass, and Philly Joe Jones on drums.Cook, p. 45. By the autumn Rollins had left, and at the recommendation of Jones, Davis replaced Rollins with John Coltrane.Cook, p. 46. In January 1951, Prestige Records owner and producer Bob Weinstock signed Davis to a one-year contract;Cook, p. 25. Davis would continue to record for the label into 1956. Weinstock gave Davis an advance of $750, but the company's artists' contracts were often manipulative with low royalties, paying nothing for rehearsal time.Farah Jasmine Griffin and Salim Washington. Clawing at the Limits of Cool: Miles Davis, John Coltrane, and the Greatest Jazz Collaboration Ever. New York: Thomas Dunne Books, 2008. , pp. 85-86, 160.

The school, which was established in 1976, is a middle-deemed-secondary school, meaning that it takes pupils of secondary school age while providing both Key Stage 2 and Key Stage 3 education. Fairlands is part of the Cheddar Valley Community Learning Partnership, a three-tier education system which comprises nine first schools, two middle schools and one secondary school. Pupils enter Fairlands from first schools in Cheddar and the nearby villages of Draycott, Shipham and Axbridge. In year 9 pupils move to The Kings of Wessex Academy, also in Cheddar. History The 1976 Education Act abolished the tripartite education system of grammar and secondary modern schools in England and Wales. Up to this point, the area was served by The Kings of Wessex School secondary modern and Sexey's Grammar School in Blackford near Wedmore. In 1976, the three-tier Cheddar Valley Community Learning Partnership was established, creating a system of first, middle and comprehensive upper schools in the area. The Kings of Wessex School became a comprehensive, Sexey's Grammar School became Hugh Sexey Church of England Middle School serving half of the Cheddar Valley, and Fairlands Middle School was established to serve the other half. In September 2010, Fairlands was one of the first two middle schools in England to be awarded specialist Technology College status. In 2011, Fairlands was twinned with School 108 in the central Russian city of Yekaterinburg, as part of the BBC Olympic Dreams project. Both schools will use the partnership for cultural exchange, and followed the progress of high jumper and former School 108 pupil Ivan Ukhov in the 2012 Summer Olympics. Academic performance In 2010, 68% of pupils achieved Level 4 in mathematics and English in the National Curriculum assessment for Key Stage 2. This was below the national average of 73% and the Somerset County Council average of 75%, and a drop on the school's achievement for the previous four years. In 2009, an inspection by Ofsted rated the school as good on a four-point scale of outstanding, good, satisfactory, and poor. The report praised the school's standard of education, leadership, teaching and expectations by both staff and pupils, all of which had improved since the previous inspection in 2006.

Background Walsh grew up in a Roman Catholic family in the Glenorchy district of Hobart, Tasmania, Australia, the youngest of three children. He attended Dominic College, and the University of Tasmania, where he briefly studied mathematics and computer science in 1979. Walsh made his fortune by developing a gambling system used to bet on horse racing and other sports. Walsh describes himself as a \\"rabid atheist\\". He has been married twice, the second time in March 2014, to artist Kirsha Kaechele. He has three children from different relationships. In 2001, he founded the Moorilla Museum of Antiquities on the Berriedale peninsula in Hobart, which closed in 2007 to undergo $75 million renovations. It was re-opened in January 2011 as the Museum of Old and New Art or MONA. MONA won the 2012 Australian Tourism Award for best new development and is a major Tasmanian tourist attraction. In July 2012, Walsh was involved in a dispute with the Australian Tax Office, which demanded he pay $37 million from the profits of his gambling system. The dispute was \\"entirely resolved\\" in October 2012.\\"Walsh settles tax debt\\", ABC News. Retrieved 4 December 2012. In December 2013 Walsh gave a revealing interview on his personal philosophies, his quantitative approach to gambling, and the role of chance in his life to The Australian Financial Review's contributing editor Christopher Joye. He has stated that he subsequently developed a new chapter in his 2014 memoir based on the ideas that were formulated during this dialogue. In October 2014 Walsh's book A Bone of Fact was published. The publisher described it as Walsh's \\"utterly unconventional and absorbing memoir\\". On 20 July 2015 Walsh's partner Kirsha Kaechele gave birth to their child Sunday Walsh.

History The line was opened on 23 December 1911 from Clarens (a point above the railway underbridge carrying the main line between Geneva and Montreux) to Blonay. The line to the boat landing stage was not originally built due financial problems and it was 3 1/2 years before it was completed, opening on 4 July 1915. Its life was short, the last stage to open being the first to close, on 31 October 1943; the remainder closed on 31 December 1955. Route description The line was long, of which was on the road and on its own right of way. Leaving the boat landing stage at Clarens the line joined with that of the Vevey‚ÄìMontreux‚ÄìChillon‚ÄìVilleneuve tramway for a distance of until reaching the Place Gambetta where it left the tramway and headed north towards the railway station where the main line railway was negotiated by means of an underbridge. Following the road to the suburb of Tavel the line made its first crossing of the Clarens river and headed for Chailly, distant. At Chailly the line, at the station, was joined by another, latterly only a siding but originally a branch to reach the village. After leaving Chailly the Clarens river was crossed again as the line climbed to the Rapes aux Roz where it crossed the Montreux - Brent road near Planchamp. Shortly after this the main line of the Montreux- Oberland Bernois railway (MOB) was crossed by an underbridge before the line passed through its only tunnel, just long. The line followed the MOB to reach Fontanivent station, the CCB having to cross the MOB into a headshunt where the trains reversed in order to continue their journey. From Fontanivent the line followed the road betwixt Montreux and Blonay through the village of Brent and made its third crossing of the Clarens valley over the Pont de Brent viaduct. Following the road to just south of the village of Tercier when it left for a run on its own reservation until it reached the railway station at Blonay. Talks to build a \\"joint\\" station with the CEV came to nought and the tramway built its own facilities to the rear of the main platform. Technical information The line has a height difference of between its termini and a maximum gradient of 8.7%. The line had four passing places and only two significant engineering structures, the tunnel at Fontanivent and the Brent viaduct. Overhead equipment, provided by Oerlikon (MFO), had a supply of 750 V DC, the same as the MOB at the time and the loading gauge had the same height and roof arc, but was slightly narrower. This was done with the intention of the line taking some goods traffic from the MOB. The line had no workshops or sheds, maintenance was carried out by the MOB at the Chernex depot. Power was supplied from the MOB power station, again at Chernex. The cost of the line was CHF 655,980.43 to the end of 1912 and it was increased to CHF 718,484.04 by the end of 1913 with the construction of the extension to the quayside at Clarens. Rolling stock At opening the line had three Ce 2/2 4-wheel railcars, numbered 1, 2 and 3, each with 14 seats and electrical equipment provided by MFO. All three lasted the full life of the line being scrapped in 1955. In 1913 Ateliers de Constructions M√©caniques de Vevey delivered 2 small baggage trailers, M 1 and M 2\\\\. One of these was, in the late 1920s, at least temporarily, fitted out to carry passengers. M1 was scrapped in 1955, M 2 was converted to a service vehicle for use on the MOB. The line gained three trailer cars from the Compagnie Genevoise des Tramways √âlectriques (CGTE), C 11 and C 12 arrived on the line in 1930, C 14 in 1932. Like the railcars they could seat 14 but also had places for 10 standees.

Career Vujin started his professional career in his hometown club RK Sintelon, where he played with national teammate ≈Ωarko ≈†e≈°um and Bosnian goalkeeper Danijel ≈†ariƒá, who later won the EHF Champions League with FC Barcelona Handbol. In July 2003, he was signed by the Hungarian Championship outfit Dunaferr SE, who were strengthening their squad for the forthcoming EHF Cup campaign. Vujin spent three years with the Danube-side and collected a championship bronze medal in each season. Although during his spell in Dunaferr the club did not manage to break the dominance of the SC Pick Szeged‚ÄìMKB Veszpr√©m KC duo, he showed his unique scoring skills and was crowned as the top scorer of the Hungarian Championship in the 2005‚Äì06 season. With his brilliant performances he drew the attention of MKB Veszpr√©m, and the record champions secured the services of the right back in the summer of 2006. In his new club Vujin has grown into a player of the highest calibre and became the key of Veszpr√©m's success. He helped the team to the EHF Cup Winners' Cup title in 2008 with scoring nine goals in the first leg of the finals, that was eventually won by the Hungarian club with a five-goal margin. On 30 October 2009, while playing against Hungary in an international friendly tournament, Vujin suffered a serious knee injury that had to be operated. He underwent surgery on 4 December 2009 and the recovery process took four months. He returned into action on 3 April 2010 against HCM Constan»õa in an EHF Champions League match. He entered the field first in the 45th minute to take a penalty shot, which he missed, however, his teammate Carlos P√©rez scored from the rebound. Few minutes later he got another chance from the line and this time he did not miss. In the autumn of 2010, he reached his best form again and in the winter break he topped the EHF Champions League top scorers' list with 65 goals, sixteen goals ahead of second placed Uwe Gensheimer. His continuous superb play attracted the attention of THW Kiel, the Champions League winners of the past season, and the German club offered a contract for Vujin that Veszprem could not match. As a result, the Serbian international will now join Kiel in 2012, once his current contract expires. He played for the Serbia national handball team at the 2012 European Men's Handball Championship and won a silver medal.

Near the end of the American Revolutionary War, he was captured by a British naval frigate, , commanded by Horatio Nelson, whom he later assisted in escaping a superior French force. Biography Carver was born on 24 September 1740 in Plymouth in the then-British Province of Massachusetts Bay. He played an active part in town affairs and served on many juries and committees. =Encounter with Horatio Nelson= Nelson was patrolling the bay now known as Massachusetts Bay, when on 14 July 1782, he stumbled upon and captured the Plymouth schooner Harmony. Lacking knowledge of the dangerous shoals in the area, Nelson 'invited' the schooner's master, Carver, to act as pilot. Carver agreed to help the British, even though he was a prominent citizen of Plymouth and had previously signed the Plymouth Petition, drawn up in 1773 in opposition to British tyranny. Carver had been aboard the Albemarle for a month when she encountered a squadron of four French ships of the line and a frigate. Carver's knowledge allowed Nelson to run his ship among the shoals of St George's bank. The four larger ships abandoned the pursuit but the frigate continued to follow. With the odds evened, Albemarle backed sail. The French frigate declined the challenge and returned to her squadron. Nelson decided to reward Carver's invaluable assistance. \\"You have rendered us, sir, a very essential service and it is not the custom of English seamen to be ungrateful\\", Nelson explained as he presented Carver with his ship and a letter intended to protect him from further harassment. It stated, \\"These are to certify that I took the schooner Harmony, Nathaniel Carver, master, belonging to Plymouth, but on acc't of his good services have given him up his vessel again. Dated on b'd His Majesty's ship Albemarle, 7 Aug., 1782, in Boston Bay. Horatio Nelson\\". Carver took his vessel and returned home to Plymouth but realising that having helped the enemy, he would be viewed as a traitor, he concocted a story to explain his good fortune. Carver claimed that he had borrowed another boat and sailed out to Albemarle with sheep and fresh vegetables which he then exchanged for his schooner. Nelson, Carver went on, was so overwhelmed with his kindness that he not only returned the vessel, he presented him with the letter noting his 'good services'. This story apparently convinced his fellow countrymen, and indeed, when Nelson died in 1805, a letter from Boston arrived in England, which repeated Carver's version of events. Nathaniel Carver died on 1 May 1815 at the age of 74. He is buried on the southeasterly side of Old Burial Hill in Plymouth, Massachusetts.

The club is one of the six founding members of the American Football Bundesliga, alongside the D√ºsseldorf Panther, Frankfurter L√∂wen, Ansbach Grizzlies, Munich Cowboys and Berlin Bears, but has not played at this level since 1986.Football History Historic American football tables from Germany, accessed: 24 January 2011  History  The club was formed in February 1979 and is, behind the D√ºsseldorf Panther, the second-oldest still existing American football club in Germany.About us Bremerhaven Seahawks website, accessed: 24 January 2011 In 1979, the American Football Bundesliga, later to be renamed the German Football League,GFL German Football League AFVD website, accessed: 24 January 2011 was formed, consisting of six clubs, among them the Bremerhaven Seahawks.Geschichte AFVD website, accessed: 24 January 2011 The team did not take part in the second season of the league, instead taking part in the formation of a rival league with a number of other clubs. The Seahawks won the regular season of this league, the Nordwestdeutsche Football-Liga (NFL), but lost the final to the D√ºsseldorf Panther. The club's success in this era is mostly attributed to the high content of US American players. For the 1981 season, the team returned to the Bundesliga, where it finished third but outside of the play-offs. Finishing in the same position the following year, the club qualified for the post season in a now extended format, but lost in the quarter finals to the Hanau Hawks. The era of the Seahawks at elite level now quickly drew to an end. In 1983, the team finished seventh but was excluded from league football after that because its large foreign player contingent violated new regulations that limited the number of non-German players per team. It returned to the league once more for the 1986 season, having spent 1985 at the tier below, but was now outclassed, only drawing one game and losing all of the remaining nine. For the next five seasons, the club played at the second tier of American football in Germany, the 2nd Bundesliga. In its first season there, it won the northern division without defeat, but missed out on promotion to the Ratingen Raiders. In 1987, the team joined local club OSC Bremerhaven to be able to use their Nordsee-Stadion for home games and remains a part of this club. After this, the Seahawks slipped to the lower half of the table and, in 1992, the club, despite having qualified, did not field in the league and thereby ended its era as a second tier outfit, too. The Seahawks history became somewhat erratic in the following years, competing in the fourth division in 1993, not competing at all in 1994 and 1995 and making a return in 1996 in the lowest possible league, the tier-seven Aufbauliga. The club worked its way back up as far as the tier-three Regionalliga Nord, which it played in from 2004 to 2006, but has since dropped a level, playing in the Oberliga Nord in 2010. When this league was split the club became part of the Oberliga Niedersachsen/Bremen West.

It is the first ever Samoan feature film, \\"entirely shot in Samoa, in the Samoan language, with a Samoan cast and story\\".\\"Samoan Feature Film First\\", New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage, 11 October 2010 The film was selected as the New Zealand entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 84th Academy Awards, but it did not make the final shortlist. It is the first time New Zealand has submitted a film in this category. Plot Manu Asafo has described the film as an attempt \\"to portray Samoan culture\\". It shows Samoans \\"surrounded by family and support\\", in accordance with fa'aSamoa (the \\"Samoan way\\"). The New Zealand Film Commission describes it as showcasing not only \\"Samoan tradition and values\\", but also \\"universal\\" themes: \\"love, courage, personal adversity and honour\\". Samoan Deputy Prime Minister Misa Telefoni has described it as \\"a beautiful and poignant love story\\" which brings \\"the finest aspects of traditions of our Samoan culture into the international spotlight\\".\\"NZ Film commission is supporting NZ/Samoan film \\"The Orator\\"\\", NZ Film and TV, 12 October 2010 The main character, Saili, a \\"simple villager\\", a taro farmer and a dwarf, must \\"find the strength\\" to \\"defend his land and family, which are threatened by powerful adversaries\\". \\"He ultimately attempts to reclaim his father's chiefly status, even if the current ageing village chief does not believe he has the physique or the oratory skill required.\\" Tamasese described his film as \\"my image of what I see of growing up in Samoa\\", and \\"a bit like a tour.

Maiava Nathaniel Lees and Michael Eldred are associate producers, and Samoan chief Manu Asafo served as cultural advisor. Filming was completed in January 2011, with the film scheduled to be screened in cinemas later in the year. The Orator \\"will be distributed in New Zealand, Australia and the Pacific by Transmission Films\\", while NZ Film will handle distribution beyond Oceania. Misa Telefoni, who is also Samoan Minister for Tourism, has expressed hope that the film will attract international attention to Samoa, and promote the country as a tourist destination. The film had its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival, in Italy on 3 September 2011. This was the first time that Samoa were represented at the festival and saw a return for New Zealand after a 4-year absence (the last film shown at the festival was Cargo).Cargo, New Zealand Film The Orator premiered in Samoa's only cinema -Magik Cinema in Apia- on 1 October 2011. It was screened in cinemas in New Zealand on 6 October. Reception The New Zealand Herald noted: :\\"Thanks in large part to the almost edibly gorgeous cinematography of Leon Narbey, the film is a sumptuously moody visual experience: the opening shot, of rain on a mountain, might have been painted by McCahon; water runs mercury-silver off taro leaves; tiny details like a snail on a gravestone are lingered over lovingly. The sound design is equally precise and evocative. :Importantly, it's a film of great patience and watchfulness. Shots of 10 seconds are the rule, not the exception; you can feel your heartbeat slow as you watch it.\\" Variety described it as \\"a compelling drama\\", an \\"exploration of love, death and bitter family conflict that unfolds in sync with the relaxed rhythms of Pacific island life\\", and an \\"ausipicious debut\\" for Tamasese. Sagote, in the lead role, was \\"tremendously soulful-eyed\\", while Pushparaj was \\"excellent\\", \\"exuding the dignity of a queen\\": :\\"Tamasese gradually weaves the separate story strands together (fittingly, given the centrality of straw mats that various characters weave and give as gifts in the story), culminating in a scene in which Saili must make a ceremonial oration after a tragedy - a touchingly crafted and performed sequence that grips as drama and as an insightful look at the Samoan way of life. :Script offers an insider's view of a society that just about keeps a lid on simmering violence through complex, ritualized forms of group interaction and humor, a portrait that goes some way toward exploding the myth of Samoans as peace-loving, noble-savage proto- hippies. Balance of cultural insights and storytelling makes for a universally appealing yarn that renders the exotic comprehensible, although the film's stately pace may prove challenging to viewers with shorter attention spans.\\"\\"Review: The Orator\\", Variety, 19 September 2011 The Hollywood Reporter praised the film as \\"a beautifully nuanced debut\\" with a \\"deeply moving climax\\", which both \\"succeeds on one level as an insider‚Äôs intricate cultural study\\" and \\"is powered by a slow-burning underdog drama that canvasses weighty themes of family honor, courage and redemption\\". It also praised Sagote as \\"already a master of non-verbal communication. Quiet and watchful, he speaks volumes with his eyes\\". The Camden Advertiser encouraged readers to see the film, saying its most interesting aspect was \\"the observation of the intricacies of the Samoan culture - which hitherto had not been committed to cinema\\" and which are conveyed \\"very subtly within a very universal tale\\".\\"Samoan underdog tale is triumphant\\", Camden Advertiser, 16 November 2011 Writing for the New Zealand Herald, Samoan New Zealander Cherelle Jackson said the film was culturally accurate, touching and \\"beautifully done\\", and that it \\"makes no pretence, it doesn't make the Samoan culture look beautiful and admirable, it draws out the violence, the hatred, the slanted hierarchy and ultimately the discriminating nature of our people in a story line that happens in real life\\". The West Australian wrote: \\"The Orator is a fascinating journey into Samoan life, but the slow pace of this way of life does make for a slow-paced film. There are lots of scenes where Saili is shown deep in thought, or his wife Vaaiga is sitting weaving the mats that are a major cultural occupation. The Orator does have its dramatic highpoints and the verbal-jousting conclusion is well staged by the cast of Samoans, who were drawn from the villages on Upolu\\".\\"Movie review: The Orator\\", The West Australian, 25 January 2012 Awards Special Mention from the jury of the Orizzonti section of the Venice International Film Festival; Art Cinema Award from the CICAE jury of the Festival; CinemAvvenire Best Film Award from the jury of the Associazione Centro Internazionale CinemAvvenire; shortlisted for the Best Feature Film Script Award of the Script Writers Awards of New Zealand; Audience Award at the Brisbane International Film Festival.\\"The Orator (O Le Tulafale) in Sundance‚Äôs Spotlight\\", New Zealand Film Commission press release, 2 December 2011 The film was also \\"selected to screen in the Spotlight section of the 2012 Sundance International Film Festival\\".

It is named after Huayra-tata, a Quechua wind god.. See especially \\"Press Release\\". The Huayra was named \\"The Hypercar of the Year 2012\\" by Top Gear magazine. On 11 February 2015 it was reported that the Pagani Huayra has been sold out. The Huayra was limited to just 100 units as part of Pagani's agreement with engine supplier Mercedes-AMG. The Pagani Huayra was officially debuted online with several pictures in a press release on 25 January 2011. The official world debut was at the headquarters of Pirelli in Milan in February 2011. Specifications A Pagani Huayra on display with all user accessible compartments open The Huayra has a top speed of about and it has a 0- acceleration time of 2.8 seconds. Using Pirelli tyres, the Pagani Huayra is capable of withstanding 1.66 g of lateral acceleration The Pagani Huayra uses a seven-speed sequential gearbox and a single disc clutch. The choice not to use a dual-clutch was due to the increase in weight of over , thus negating any advantage of the faster gear changes in a double-clutch transmission. As a result, the transmission weighs . The car is equipped with Brembo brake calipers, rotors and pads. The calipers have four pistons in front and four in the rear. The rotors are drilled carbon ceramic, in diameter and thick. The Huayra uses a twin-turbocharged M158 60¬∞ V12 engine developed by Mercedes-AMG specially for the Huayra, which has a power output of at 5,800 rpm and of torque at 2,250-4,500 rpm. The engine has been designed at the request of Pagani to reduce turbo lag and improve response, achieved with smaller turbochargers, a different intercooler configuration and re-programmed ECU settings. Like many high-performance cars, the Huayra uses dry sump lubrication. This has several key benefits including guaranteeing oil flow even when the car is subjected to extreme lateral acceleration, preventing \\"oil surge\\" which allows the engine to operate more efficiently while the lack of an oil pan allows mounting the engine lower, lowering the car's center of gravity and improving handling. The fuel consumption of the Huayra is in city and in highway (EPA testing). A water / oil heat exchanger reduces engine warm-up times on cold days and helps maintain a stable temperature for refrigerants and lubricants. To minimise the use of pipes and fittings (and the overall weight of the vehicle), the expansion tank is mounted directly on the engine. Intercooler fins act as an expansion tank circuit at low temperatures. The titanium exhaust system was designed and built by MHG- Fahrzeugtechnik. Hydroformed joints were developed to reduce back pressure and ensure a free flow exhaust. Titanium reduces the weight of the exhaust system while the Inconel silencers improve reliability in the most exposed parts of the exhaust at high temperatures. The entire system weighs less than .  Aerodynamics  A Huayra's aerodynamic flaps in action The Pagani Huayra is different from its predecessor in that it incorporates active aerodynamics. It is capable of changing the height of the front from the ground and independently operating four flaps placed at the rear and front of the car. The behavior of the flaps is managed by a dedicated control unit that is fed information from systems such as the ABS and ECU, which pass on information about the car's speed, yaw rate, lateral acceleration, steering angle and throttle position. This is intended to achieve minimal drag coefficient or maximum downforce depending on the situation. The Huayra's designer Horacio Pagani states that it has a variable drag coefficient of between .31 and .37. The system also prevents excess body roll in the corners by raising the \\"inside\\" flaps (i.e. the left ones in a left-handed corner and vice versa), increasing the downforce on that side of the car. The rear flaps also act as an airbrake. Under hard braking, both the front suspension and the two rear flaps are raised to counter-act weight transfer to the front wheels and keep the whole car stable, for instance when entering a corner. Air from the radiator is extracted through an arch in the bonnet at an angle that is designed not to affect the streamline around the body. The side air intakes behind the front wheels create a low pressure zone, resulting in downforce. Variants = Huayra Roadster = After 2 years of development, the Huayra Roadster was officially unveiled at the 2017 Geneva Motor Show. The over-all appearance of the car has changed, with the most obvious being the removable top (hence the Roadster name). This part of the vehicle is also its key element. The design of the rear is also different, with new eyelid-like fixed flaps that continue with the design and eventually end on the rear lights. The rear engine cover also has a new shape to adapt to the roadster form and now has vents for efficient cooling. The wheels are unique and specifically constructed for the car. The car has conventional doors instead of the Gull- wing doors of the coup√© as they are impossible to fit on an open top car without maintaining the low weight The vehicle utilises the same twin- turbocharged M158 V12 engine as the coup√©, but it now has a total power output of at 6,200 rpm and of torque at 2,400 rpm. All of this power is delivered to the rear wheels via an all-new 7-speed automated manual transmission by Xtrac. The car now uses a hydraulic and electronic activation system with carbon synchronizers. Bosch has also contributed in the construction of the car and the car uses their ECU system. The weight is now lighter, for a total of , making it the first roadster lighter than the coupe version. Only 100 will be made, all of which have already been sold. The tyre supplier is Pirelli, with P-Zero tyres. The tyre have a white narrow outline, resembling those of an F1 race car. Pagani has also used a new material for the Roadster called carbon triax, which is a tri-axis fiberglass meshed with carbon-fibre power bands. Pagani states that the car produces of downforce or 1.8 lateral G-force. However, this figure is unproven, but if true, Pagani will have set a new record. =Huayra BC and BC roadster= Huayra BC The Huayra BC is a track focused version of the Huayra which was unveiled at the 2016 Geneva Motor Show. The Huayra BC is named after the late Benny Caiola, a friend of Horacio Pagani, and the first Pagani customer. The Huayra BC has an improved version of the standard Huayra's 6.0 L twin-turbocharged V12 engine having a power output of as well as of torque. The dry weight is reduced by to just , thanks to the use of a new material called 'carbon triax' which Pagani claims is 50% lighter and 20% stronger than regular carbon fibre, giving the car a power-to- weight ratio of per horsepower. The Huayra BC comes with a lighter titanium exhaust system, new aluminum alloy wheels, and a stripped out interior. The tires are Pirelli P-Zero Corsas that feature 12 different rubber compounds, and the suspension and wishbones are made of aeronautical grade aluminum, known as Avional. The Huayra BC also has a new front bumper with a front splitter and winglets, deeper side skirts, and an air diffuser that stretches the entire width of the rear bumper with a large rear wing. All of the exterior components in the car are used to optimize downforce and drag. The Huayra BC uses an all-new Xtrac 7-speed sequential manual transmission. Pagani has stuck with a single-clutch gearbox because it weighs 40% less than double- clutch gearboxes. All 20 units of the Huayra BC coup√© have been sold out. Introduced in June 2019 on the CSR Racing 2 app, the Huayra BC Roadster is an open top variant of the Huarya BC. It shares the same aerodynamic parts as present on the BC but has a more powerful 6.0-litre twin-turbocharged V12 engine rated at and of torque. The 7-speed Xtrac sequential gearbox with single clutch used on the roadster is 35% lighter than a contemporary dual- clutch gearbox. The Huayra BC roadster is slightly heavier than the coupe and has a dry weight of but is lighter than the Huayra roadster. The monocoque of the roadster is constructed of carbon-titanium HP62 material to keep weight low and make the construction rigid. The BC roadster is claimed to generate of downforce at due to its large fixed rear wing and aerodynamic elements. In addition to movable active Aero elements, the titanium exhaust incorporates flaps in the catalytic converters to divert exhaust gases over the underfloor elements like a Formula 1 car's blown diffuser. Production of the roadster will be limited to 40 units only. Special editions Pagani has developed several special editions of the Huayra upon customer request. = Carbon Edition = Huayra Carbon Edition on display The first special edition was the Pagani Huayra Carbon Edition, unveiled in 2012, along with the White Edition. It features a full carbon fibre body, wheels and interior trim, hence the \\"carbon\\" part of the name. The interior features red leather upholstery and carbon fibre inserts. The specifications are the same as the standard Huayra. = White Edition = Huayra White Edition. The White Edition was unveiled in 2012, along with the Carbon Edition. The car features a white and black carbon fibre exterior, a white and black interior, and aluminum wheels. = La Monza Lisa = This special edition Huayra, called \\"La Monza Lisa\\" was built for well known car collector Kris Singh. It features tricolore racing stripes and side stripes inspired by the Zonda Revolucion, and a bright red interior with white stitching inspired by a Zonda F Roadster. At the customer's request, Pagani also reengineered the firewall behind the occupants to be finished in a mixture of matte and gloss fully exposed carbon fibre for visual effect as well as to pass more engine vibration through to the carbon fibre seats, per the customer's request. La Monza Lisa also features a one-off exhaust system and bespoke turbochargers built by Michael K√ºbler and Mercedes-AMG. = 730S \\"Da Vinci\\" = Huayra 730S (now known as Da Vinci) on the road The 730S special edition was unveiled at the AutoGallery of Beverly Hills in February 2015. Most of the car's specifications are heavily inspired from the Zonda Tricolore. The car was specially built for Alejandro Salomon (a.k.a. Salomondrin), a Mexican-American entrepreneur, former film producer and YouTube personality. The car was later sold to David Lee, a jewelry and watch tycoon and a well known Ferrari collector, due to Salomondrin's complaints after driving it for a year. The car was later renamed \\"Da Vinci\\" by Lee after his purchase and was upgraded with the Tempesta package. = Huayra BC Kingtasma = A Pagani Huayra BC, finished in red carbon fibre, was delivered to the United States and is dubbed \\"Kingtasma\\" by the owner. The Kingtasma is one of only four Pagani Huayra BC models equipped with a roof scoop, it is also the only Huayra BC fitted with a cup holder from the factory. It also features gold carbon fibre crowns on the underside of both of the rear flaps. The Huayra BC Kingtasma is owned by an American real estate tycoon from the east coast of the United States. The owner, same father-son duo, also own the Pagani Huayra called \\"The King\\". = Huayra BC Macchina Volante = Huayra BC Macchina Volante Collector Kris Singh had commissioned a special BC called \\"Macchina Volante\\" (the Flying Machine) built in 2017, with extra amounts of blue carbon fiber and a few Italian flags adorning it. It also has additional rear air intakes and blue brake calipers. = Pearl = Huayra Pearl The Huayra Pearl, unveiled in May 2016, is a special edition of the Huayra. It features the split rear wing inspired by the Zonda C12, and the roof air scoop inspired by the Zonda Cinque. Like the Carbon Edition and Da Vinci, the car has an exposed carbon fibre body finished in a dark blue colour. It was involved in an accident in Paris in July 2016 but was rebuilt again by the factory in 2017 with an upgraded engine now having a power output of , making it the most powerful Huayra ever made. It can accelerate from 0‚Äì in 2.2 seconds and has a claimed top speed in excess of . It shares many components with the Huayra BC and the Zonda R including the suspension, gearbox, top mounted air intake and the motorsport derived carbo-titanium monocoque which reduces weight by less than before. The rebuild took 24 months to complete. = Dinastia = The Huayra Dinastia was a special edition of three Huayra coup√©s revealed to the public in 2016. Horacio Pagani's inspiration for this car came from the Nine-Dragon Wall in China. Three cars were initially planned to be built and sold, but after October 2016, based on the request of customers and after the research proving that the purple and red are in the same colour family (shades of magenta), the Red has been replaced with the Purple. Each unit also has a certain livery. The design of the car reflects Horacio's visit with each unit's livery design resembling one of the dragons on the wall, and it also has an aerodynamic fin on the rear, mostly likely to resemble a dragon's tail. The liveries of the cars are: * Blue carbon livery (Baxia, the water dragon) * Purple carbon livery (Yazi, the warrior dragon) * Gold carbon livery (Chiwen, the protective dragon of fire and rain) Mechanically, the Dinastia is identical to the normal Pagani Huayra however, Pagani has installed a lighter titanium exhaust system, new 21-inch forged aluminium alloy wheels, a new front splitter and winglets, deeper side skirts, and an additional rear fin to help the air stream to minimize drag. = Hermes Edition = The Huayra Herm√®s Edition, unveiled in 2016, is a special edition Huayra owned by Iranian-American millionaire Manny Khoshbin. It features the Tempesta package as well as coffee brown colored exposed carbon fiber bodywork and a matching custom caramel leather interior designed by Herm√®s, and handmade and stitched at their factory in Paris. Other changes include a custom Herm√®s shift knob, intake grates with laser cut \\"H\\" pattern reminiscent of their logo, and a set of matching Huayra luggage bags. = L'Ultimo = The L'Ultimo is the final Huayra coup√© built for a US based customer. It features the same mechanical components as a normal Huayra coup√© but features many bespoke parts unique to the car, such as the Pacchetto Tempesta aerodynamics package, a roof scoop inspired by the Zonda R and a bespoke rear wing. The paint work is also unique and takes inspiration from Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton's F1 car. The interior is also in contrast with the exterior colour and features white leather seats with turquoise floor mats and centre console. = Imola = Named after the famous Italian racing track, the Imola is a special variant of the Huayra featuring aggressive aerodynamic parts. The Imola was unveiled in September 2019 at a private ceremony held in Switzerland and will be limited to only 5 examples. The first customer of the Imola is Oleg Egorov, founder and owner of TopCar Design. The Imola is the most powerful variant of the Huayra to date, using the same Mercedes-AMG V12 tuned to and . Weight saving measures such as new a new carbon fibre blend and lightweight paint application have reduced the Imola's dry weight to . Exterior changes from the standard Huayra include a large seven-section diffuser with orange accents, a large roof scoop, a shark fin, more pronounced side skirts and a wide fixed rear wing with an integrated stoplight.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. It stands in an isolated position in fields about west of the centre of Ipswich. History The oldest fabric in the church dates from the 12th century, but most is from the 14th century. In 1866 the church was restored by Edmund Buckton Lamb, and a north baptistry was added. Architecture =Exterior= St Mary's is constructed in flint rubble and some brick, with stone dressings. The roof is tiled, with alternating bands of red and black fishscale tiles. Its plan consists of a nave and a chancel, with a south porch, a north vestry and baptistry, and a west tower. The flint tower is in three stages with a brick battlemented parapet. There are angled buttresses on the west corners and a stair turret at the southeast corner. The turret contains vertical slit openings. The tower stands on a plinth, above which is a band of stone and flint flushwork in a chequerboard pattern. On the west side of the tower is a three-light window dating from the 19th century. There are single bell openings on the north, west and south sides. The south porch dates from the 19th century and is in timber on a brick and flint base. Its roof is in banded tiles. The porch leads to a 19th-century doorway in the style of the 14th century. The nave and chancel also stand on a plinth, which is rendered, above which is a band of alternate stone and flushwork panels, which continues round the church, including the buttresses. To the left of the porch is a two-light window with late Decorated or early Perpendicular tracery and, to its right is a small lancet window, probably dating from the 12th century. To the west of this are two 19th-century three-light windows between which is a buttress and, to the west of these, a chancel door. At the east end are diagonal buttresses. The 19th-century east window has three lights. The windows in the north wall are similar to those on the south side. =Interior= The 14th-century stone carving in the chancel is \\"exquisite\\".

On July 29 every year, the Great Military Parade of Peru celebrating the anniversary of Peru's declaration of independence from Spain in 1821 is held in Lima, the national capital, by members of the Peruvian Armed Forces and the National Police of Peru and is presided over by the President of Peru and his First Family, members of the Council of Ministers of Peru and the Congress of the Republic of Peru, other civil officials, ecclesiastical leaders, the Diplomatic Corps of Peru, and other invited guests, among them commanders and other officers and personnel of the Armed Forces and the National Police. The celebrations since 1939 have always been held a day after Peruvian Independence Day on July 28, where the Te Deum held in the Cathedral of Lima is the focal point of the celebrations. The parade formally marks the end of Independence Day festivities nationwide. Introduction and history Marina de Guerra del Per√∫. Parada Militar 2012. Fuerza A√©rea del Per√∫. Parada Militar 2012. Escuela Militar de Chorrillos. Parada Militar 2012. Polic√≠a Nacional del Per√∫. Parada Militar 2012. Every July 28 until 1937, military parades led by the Peruvian Armed Forces were held in Lima's Plaza de Armas, adjacent to the Government Palace, right after the Te Deum at the City Cathedral. But in July 28, 1921, after the Te Deum the military parade was held in Plaza Bolivar to celebrate the nation's centennial year. In 1938, the parades were moved to the Campo de Marte, at the site of the old Sta. Beatriz Hippodrome. It stayed there until 1960. The next year, emulating the Chilean style holiday system, the parade moved to its new date of July 29, where it stays to this day. The parade moved to Lima's Avenida Brasil on July 29, 1961, and would stay there until 1974. The next year, months after the February 5 coup d'√©tat against the military government, it was suspended by President General Francisco Bermundez, and stayed that way for 3 more years. The parades returned to Avenida Brazil in 1979, in time for the 100th year of the War of the Pacific, and remained so until 1984. In 1985, the parade moved to Admiral Grau Plaza to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of the Gentleman of the Seas, Grand Admiral of Peru Miguel Grau, the Peruvian naval hero of the War of the Pacific. But starting the next year, President of Peru Alan Garc√≠a decided to hold the parade in the Plaza Mayor for the first time in years, due to security reasons. The parades held there lasted until 1989, and in 1990 returned to the Campo del Marte, where it stayed until 1992. In 1993, the parades, now presided by President Alberto Fujimori, returned to Avenida Brasil, but for the first time, the parade happened on July 27, the eve of Independence Day. The parades stayed on that location until 1996, and then returned to the Campo de Marte from 1997 to 1999. In 2000, the parades were held at the Peruvian Army Headquarters Parade Ground for the first time, due to anti-government protests against the disputed election results. For the first time in 2001, the parade, due to President Alejandro Toledo's visit to Cusco on July 29, was held in the Avenida Brasil on July 30. The next year, it returned to the Campo de Marte until 2004, then came back to the Avenida Brasil location from 2005 to 2007, and came back to the Campo de Marte in 2008. The 2009 parade, originally scheduled for July 29, was held off (due to the AH1N1 epidemic) until December 8, the feast of the Immaculate Concepcion and on the eve of Peruvian Army Day and the anniversary of the Battle of Ayacucho, still in the Campo de Marte. It was the first time that the motorized parade started off first and after the historical troops and the UN peacekeepers contingent, the foot parade was divided into three segments: military schools, military NCO schools, and active units. In 2010, the parades came back in the Avenida Brasil venue, and for the first time civil contingents representing veterans of the Peruvian Army and recipients of Army programs for the poor and indigenous peoples marched past the tribune, plus alumni of Armed Forces educational institutions. The 2011 parade, the first under President Ollanta Humala, marked the nation's 190th year of nationhood and for the first time, the Peruvian Army Reserve, civil militias of the Armed Forces as well as contingents from all over South America joined the parade march past. 2012 saw the first school participation in the parade for the first time, and the order in the historical segment reflected the order of appearance of the Armed Forces and the National Police, and for the first time in that segment, the Chavin de Huantar Commando Company placed last. 2013's parade was the first to include appearances from the National Penetencial Institution and ground formations of the Peruvian Firefighters Corps plus a delegation of the BECA 18 program and veterans of the nation's peacekeeping service, and the historical segment as a whole was disbanded, thus the services on parade had their historical formations joining them. For the first time the Peruvian Naval School and the Naval Technological and Training Center fielded historical companies and color guards wearing Peruvian Navy uniforms worn during the War of the Pacific, while the Peruvian Army increased their historical units to eight. The RPP Noticias coverage of the parade was the first to include an online and mobile voting scheme to select the best contingents of this year's parade. 2014 saw the first parade by the Naval School and the Naval Technological and Training Center having their contingents marching in the historic dress uniforms worn the year before by the leading companies. The Dragoon Guards Regimental Band mounted a mini-concert before the mounted column segment. =Summary of the parade= * Arrivals * Arrival of the President of Peru * Review of the guard of honor * Flag Raising and moment of silence (Last Post) * Exit of the guard of honor * Authorization from the parade commander * Entrance of the bands * Post march of the bands * Marchpast proper * Mobile and mounted columns * Departures The parade in full detail In each of the venues mentioned earlier, a long grandstand with red and white banners and cockades (the colors of the Flag of Peru) is built. The stage includes the tribune in which the principal reviewing officers will watch the parade proceedings. As the President arrives escorted by troopers and the mounted band of the Presidential Life Guard Dragoons Regiment (Presidential Life-Guard Escort of the Republic of Peru), the parade commander and Commanding General, Lima Garrison gives the order to begin the review of the guard of honor composed of the members of the Armed Forces and the National Police. After this is done, he then gives the order to commence the flag ceremony. The flag raising (to the tune of the March of the Flags), the playing of the National Anthem of Peru and a tribute to all deceased active and retired military and police personnel then follow, and then the guard of honor battalion is ordered by the PC to march off. But there are times that the battalion is ordered to stand at ease until the massed bands arrive when it marches off. Before the bands would arrive the Commanding General, Lima Garrison informs the President of his permission to commence the parade, which is then approved. Afterwards, he drives off the stage in order for the Massed Bands to march in. The Massed Bands, composed of the Composite Band of National Defense formed in 1904 and composed of the central bands of the Army, Navy, Air Force and National Police then march on to the grounds. When the bands form up the parade starts marching, led by the Commanding General, Lima Garrison (who also serves as the parade commander) and his staff. Then the historical segment begins, led by color guards of the 6 units on parade: * Commando Company \\"Chav√≠n de Huantar\\" * Peruvian Legion of the Guard Infantry Battalion and Light Artillery Battery * Marine Historical Company \\"CPT Juan Fanning Garc√≠a\\" * Airborne Platoon 72nd Squadron * Police Historical Company \\"Guards Inspector (CG) Mariano Santos Mateos\\" * Peacekeeping Battalion of the Peruvian Armed Forces \\"Peru\\" The historical segment leads the marchpast in quick time of the Peruvian Armed Forces (in several occasions several units marched in double time on the parade). In recent years however foreign contingents have led the parade together with reserve and indigenous military units and alumni from the Leoncio Prado Military Academy. = Composition of the parade =  Historical and present day segments  * National Penitentcial Service * National Civil Defense Institution * Peruvian General Volunteer Firefighters Corps * Lima City Council Security Service * Alumni Association of the Leoncio Prado Military Academy * Peruvian Army Reserve * Peruvian Air Force Reserve * Peruvian Navy Reserve * Peacekeeping Battalion of the Peruvian Armed Forces \\"Peru\\" * Self-Defense Committees of the ethnic minorities of Peru  Marchpast in quick time and flypast  * Peruvian Navy ** Central Grand Band of the Peruvian Navy ** Marine Historical Company \\"CPT Juan Fanning Garc√≠a\\" ** Peruvian Naval School ** Naval Technical Instruction and Training Center ** Naval Surgeons' School ** Peruvian Merchant Marine Academy \\"Grand Admiral of Peru Miguel Grau\\" ** Peruvian Naval Infantry ** Naval Special Operations Force ** Peruvian Coast Guard ** Peruvian Naval Police ** Peruvian Navy Reserve ** Flypast of Peruvian Naval Aviation *Peruvian Air Force ** Peruvian Air Force 2nd Air Region Band ** Airborne Platoon of the 72nd Squadron ** Peruvian Air Force Academy ** Peruvian Air Force Aeronautic Education Superior Institute ** Lima Air Garrison ** Air Defense Command ** Air Force Reserve ** Air Force Police ** Air Force Special Forces ** Air Force Reserve ** Flypast of jet aircraft, trainer aircraft and combat and support helicopters of the Peruvian Air Force *Peruvian Army ** Peruvian Army Regional Band ** Peruvian Legion of the Guard Infantry Battalion, Platoon from the Junin Hussars and Light Artillery Battery ** Commando Company \\"Chav√≠n de Huantar\\" ** Chorrillos Military School ** Army Technical School ** Army Medical School ** Army Education Command ** Army Operations Command *** Army Infantry Units *** Army Engineering Units *** Army Artillery *** Army Logistics *** Army Military Police Command *** Army Special Forces *** Army Services Command ** Flypast of helicopters and fixed wing aircraft of Peruvian Army Aviation * National Police of Peru ** Massed Bands of the NPP ** Police Historical Company \\"Ensign (CG) Mariano Santos Mateos\\" ** Mariano Santos Mateos Police Academy ** National Police Higher Technical Schools ** National Police NCO Academies ** National Police Medical Academy ** Traffic Police ** Investigations Police ** Rescue Police ** NPP Special Forces ** National Police Aviation Directorate flypast  Mounted column  * Mounted Band of the Presidential Life Guard Dragoon Guards Regiment \\"FMAR Domingo Nieto\\" * Mounted Ceremonial Squadron, Presidential Life Guard Dragoon Guards Regiment \\"FMAR Domingo Nieto\\" * Mounted Ceremonial Squadron, 1st Light Cavalry Regiment \\"Junin Hussars (Liberators of Peru)\\" * Mounted Ceremonial Squadron, Chorillos Military School * Fanfare Band of the National Police Mounted Unit * National Police Equestianism School * National Police Academy Mounted Unit * National Police Mounted Police Command See also *National Police of Peru *Peruvian Armed Forces Category:Military parades Category:Parades in Peru Category:Military of Peru ","title":"Great Military Parade of Peru"},{"id":"30594744","text":"Tecumseh Sherman Fitch Tecumseh Sherman Fitch (21 March 1908 ‚Äì 7 October 1969)\\"Industrialist, Former Mayor T.

Well known authors on existential counselling are Irvin Yalom in the USA through his book Existential Psychotherapy (1981), and Emmy van Deurzen, who created the British School and published Existential Counselling and Psychotherapy in 1988.M. Adams, A Concise Introduction to Existential Counselling (2013) p. 25 Dimensions of living Existential counselling considers human living to take place in confrontation with three different dimensions ‚Äì external world; other people; inner world.E. Berne, A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis (1976) p. 287 Others would nominate four dimensions: physical, social, psychological and spiritual.M. Adams, A Concise Introduction to Existential Counselling (2013) p. 25 Each of these dimensions can be seen as constituted like a force field, within which predictable paradoxes, tensions and dilemmas play out. Human beings can learn to deal with these tensions and conflicts more effectively by facing up to the negatives as well as the positives of their lives, including the tensions of life and death, love and hate, strength and weakness and meaning and absurdity. Personal element Existential counsellors stress the importance of the examined life, and of preparatory work on oneself, in paving the way for effective counselling.H. Johns, Personal Development in Counsellor Training (1996) p. 5-6 and p. 36 Thus in counselling adolescents the counsellor can optimally model an autonomous life based on the making of realistic decisions, but one which also acknowledges the role of failure as well as success in everyday life, and the ongoing and inescapable presence of anxiety.K. and D. Geldard, Counselling Adolescents (2009) p. 76 Research basis In the debate on evidence-based research in counselling, existential counsellors tend to stress the dangers of over-simplification, and the importance of qualitative as well as quantitative measurements of outcome.R. Woolfe et al, eds., Handbook of Counselling Psychology (2009) p. 145-6 While not necessarily expecting an easy resolution of the specific/non-specific factors in therapy debate, an existential counsellor will nonetheless favor evidence-based practice.M.

It laid down that if there was a previous history of insanity, the burden of proof lies in proving the sanity of the testator when making the will. The case was decided at Doctor's Commons under civil law, but continues to be quoted in the UK, Australia and in the US as recently as 2010. Facts of the case The gravestone of Elizabethh Manning in Chadwell St Mary churchyard Elizabeth Manning died at the house of Edward Driver in Chadwell St Mary on 26 January 1805, the day after making a will. She left her estate to her nephew, her niece, and to their mother Margaret, who was Driver's wife but had previously been married to Elizabeth's brother, William. Her will excluded her two sisters.See Elizabeth Manning's will She had been advised to make a will by Eliezer Williams who was the curate of Chadwell. She had suffered from periods of insanity during the previous decade. The will was challenged by Manning's sisters on the grounds of her insanity. \\\\- see Phillimore on Google Books The case is usually cited as White v Driver. Hannah White (formerly Manning) was the sister of Elizabeth Manning. Edward and Margaret Driver were the executor and executrix named in the will. Evidence The court heard evidence for the plaintiffs that Manning had been earlier confined to the workhouse because of her insanity and had been forced to wear a straitjacket. There had also been complaints that her behaviour created a fire hazard for her neighbours. The evidence for the defendants was that she had appeared lucid to a bank clerk when withdrawing money a few days before her death. There was also evidence from the curate that she appeared to be lucid when making her will. Other witnesses attested to her lucidity around the time the will was made. Verdict The judge (Sir John Nicholl) ruled that where there was a previous history of insanity, the burden of proof rested with defendants to prove that the testator was sane when making the will. In this case, the will itself was reasonable even though it excluded her sisters. There was evidence from a number of witnesses of her lucidity in the days up to her making the will. He therefore ruled that the will was valid.

About 500 kg of gold jewellery is manufactured every year in state, the majority of which is done in Thrissur, making the city a hub of gold business and gold jewellery manufacturing in Kerala and South India. All major jewellery groups in Kerala have manufacturing facility and showrooms in Thrissur. History Muziris, as shown in the Tabula Peutingeriana, with a \\"Templum Augusti\\". Thrissur's destiny with gold started a long way back with Roman and Arab traders in the lost port city of Muziris in Kodungallur. The bad days of goldsmiths started when Economic liberalisation in India began in 1990's. The repeal of the Gold Control Act, introduction of provisions relating to gold in the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973, and the grant of permission to Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) to bring in up to 5 kg, subsequently raised to 10 kg of gold on payment of a small duty in foreign exchange. This was the last nail in the coffin of the goldsmiths. The de- regulated gold sector offered a huge opportunity for businesspersons from Thrissur and India. Some of the goldsmiths turned into businessman and later into wholesale dealers of gold jewellery. But the sector was lacking from employment problem. Most of the traditional goldsmith families next generation opted out from this old profession. Thus it attracted unskilled workers which in turn ran most of the jewellery business in Kerala now. But that change was short-lived. Craftsmen from West Bengal and Orissa were the main attraction in 2000 because of their skills. Employment A showroom of Kalyan Jewellers in Thrissur city. The city is the hub of gold jewellery manufacturing in Kerala There are around 3,000 gold ornaments manufacturing units in Thrissur city and 40,000-odd artisans and others work in these units. The industry provides direct and indirect employment to 200,000 people in Thrissur. The artisans based in these units, craft nearly 85 percent of one tonne gold which is used per day in Kerala. About 90 tonnes of gold was being used annually in Kerala for manufacturing of ornaments daily. According to Chief patron of the Jewellery Manufacturers' Association P V Jose there are over 6,000 jewellery shops in Kerala, most of which are in Thrissur. At least 20,000 workers from West Bengal and Orissa are employed in gold manufacturing units, according to him. Areas Majority of the gold ornaments manufacturing units are artisan type located within a radius of 25 km mainly centered at Thrissur, Cherpu, Perinchery, Chevvur, Ammadam, Avinissery, Nallankara, Velur, Amballur, Vallachira, Kizhakkumpattukara and Ollur.

Bayart, \\"In Memoriam Georges Dandoy s.j.,\\" CMS 6 (1962‚Äì63) 104‚Äì115, cited in Bob Robinson, Christians Meeting Hindus: An Analysis and Theological Critique of the Hindu-Christian Encounter in India (Regnum Books, 2004) 19. He is included in the so-called ‚ÄòCalcutta School of Indology‚Äô (sometimes also known as the 'Bengal School'Udayan Namboodiry, St Xavier‚Äôs: The Making of a Calcutta Institution (New Delhi: Viking/Penguin Books India, 1995) 116). Education After a year of philosophical studies at Namur (1904‚Äì1905), he was sent to Stonyhurst, England to complete his philosophy (1905‚Äì1907), and to begin studying Sanskrit at Oxford University (1907‚Äì1909). Sent to Kolkata, he began teaching at St Xavier‚Äôs College (1909‚Äì1912) before beginning his theological studies at St Mary‚Äôs, Kurseong, near Darjeeling (1912‚Äì1916). He was ordained priest in November 1914. Work His theological thinking was influenced by William Wallace SJ, a former Anglican priest who had become a Roman Catholic following his study of Hinduism. Dandoy was, above all, very close to the missiology of Pierre Charles, who encouraged an approach that was both respectful of the religions and open to the cultures of the East. After some years of teaching theology at Kurseong (1917‚Äì1922), Dandoy returned to Kolkata where he passed the rest of his life. While in Kurseong, in 1919, he published An Essay in the Doctrine of the Unreality of the World in the Advaita. In 1932 he published L'ontologie du Vedanta: Essai sur l'acosmisme de l'Advaita; Jacques Maritain and Olivier Lacombe both contributed commentaries at the end of the work. While being rector of a house of formation, he devoted himself totally to research and wrote articles and books in the field of the encounter between Catholic theology and Hinduism. With Pierre Johanns he founded and edited the monthly The Light of the East. Bibliography =Primary= *\\"The Philosophy of RƒÅmƒÅnuja as compared with that of ≈öa·πÖkara\\".

He was employed by English club Brighton & Hove Albion for nearly forty years as player and manager. Early life and career Webb was born into a Scottish military family at the Curragh Camp, a military camp in County Kildare, Ireland, where his father, Sergeant William Webb of the Black Watch, was stationed. The family moved around following Sgt Webb's postings so the young Webb spent some of his childhood in Edinburgh Castle before settling in the Worthing, Sussex, area.Carder & Harris, Albion A‚ÄìZ, pp. 254‚Äì55. As a 16-year-old, Webb played first-team played football for the town club, Worthing F.C., and in his second season, he contributed to Worthing winning a treble of the Sussex Senior Cup, the West Sussex Senior League, and a local charity cup.Vinicombe, p. 16. In 1904, Webb followed in the family tradition by enlisting in the 2nd Battalion of the Essex Regiment. His trade in the Army was a clerk, and while serving in Ireland, he furthered his football career playing for his regimental team in the Leinster Senior League, and later, in the Irish Football League for Bohemians. He scored freely for his regiment ‚Äì in November 1907 he scored all seven in a 7‚Äì4 defeat of Dublin University ‚Äì and early the following year was the only player from outside the Irish League to be selected for the Leinster representative team to play Ulster. He had a trial with Scottish club Rangers in 1908, and later that year was chosen to represent the Irish League in a match against the English League. In November, he was capped by the Ireland amateur national team, in a match against the England amateurs in Dublin. Described by The Times' reporter as \\"distinctly the best of an indifferent forward line\\", he scored Ireland's late consolation goal in a 5‚Äì1 defeat. In January 1909, while on Christmas leave from his regiment, Webb played and scored for Brighton & Hove Albion in a Southern League match against West Ham United.Carder & Harris, Seagulls!, p. 50. On his return, the Army discovered he had appeared alongside professionals and banned him from military football for 12 months. The Football Association fined the Brighton club ¬£5 \\"for having approached and played Webb in violation of the Rules of the Association.\\"Minutes of the Football Association Emergency Committee, quoted in Rumours that the military authorities would prevent him playing for Bohemians in the semifinal of the Irish Cup proved unfounded, but when Webb finished on the winning side, the Irish Times reported that Glentoran, the losing club, intended to protest his inclusion, on the grounds that playing in the Southern League made him ineligible to appear in the Irish Cup competition. The result stood, though by the time the final was played, Webb had left the club. Forced to choose between his military and his football career, he bought himself out of the Army and signed for Albion as an amateur. Brighton & Hove Albion A few days later, Webb became the first Brighton player to be capped at full international level when he made his debut for Ireland against Scotland at Ibrox Park on 15 March 1909. Ireland lost 5‚Äì0. In his second international match, a week later against Wales in Belfast, Ireland lost 3‚Äì2, and Webb had to play the second half out of position at left half because of an injury sustained by English McConnell. Called up after Aberdeen's Charlie O'Hagan withdrew from the party selected to play England in 1910, Webb was unable to accept the invitation. His third and last cap came the following year, as replacement for James Macauley; given \\"one rare chance to open the scoring ... with no one to beat but the goalkeeper\\", he shot wide as Scotland went on to win 2‚Äì0. At the end of the 1909‚Äì10 season, the Times reported that \\"Brighton and Hove Albion have not had much difficulty in finishing at the head of the Southern League\\". Webb played in every game as Albion won their first and, as of 2018, only major title. This achievement earned them a place in the FA Charity Shield in which they faced reigning Football League champions Aston Villa at Stamford Bridge in London. The only goal of the game was scored in the second half, following a corner kick taken by Albion's Bert Longstaff. Aston Villa's goalkeeper parried the ball into a knot of players, from where Bill Hastings touched it to Webb, \\"who cleverly evaded a couple of Villa defenders and found the net with a rising cross- shot.\\" Crowds packed the area around Brighton railway station to welcome the victors home at 11:30 pm, and the Sussex Daily News suggested that the team could \\"now be dubbed as Champions of England\\".Sussex Daily News match report, 6 September 1910, cited in Carder & Harris, Seagulls!, p. 55. A testimonial fund raised more than ¬£120 which was distributed among the professional players. As an amateur, Webb could receive no prize money, so the club presented him with a gold tie-pin instead.Carder & Harris, Seagulls!, p. 55. He turned professional soon afterwards. He finished as the club's leading scorer in 1912‚Äì13, with 13 goals in all competitions,Carder & Harris, Albion A‚ÄìZ, p. 338. and went on to set a club record for goals scored in the Southern League of 64. Though his Ireland career was at an end, Webb continued to be selected in representative teams. In September 1912, he scored for the Southern League as the Football League XI beat them 2‚Äì1 at Old Trafford, Manchester,Carder & Harris, Seagulls!, p. 322. and the following season, he was selected for a Southern Alliance eleven to play that league's champions, Croydon Common; among his teammates was Patsy Hendren, the England Test cricketer.Carder & Harris, Seagulls!, p. 63. A serious leg injury sustained in a match against Millwall in November 1914 effectively put an end to his playing career. First World War On the outbreak of war, Brighton & Hove Albion supported the war effort by having a rifle range built at the Goldstone Ground. Webb led rifle drill on the pitch, using wooden replicas where there were insufficient actual weapons to go round.Carder & Harris, Seagulls!, p. 66. He re-enlisted as a second lieutenant in the King's Royal Rifle Corps, and served on the Western Front from July 1917. Promoted to acting captain (the rank was confirmed after the war), he was leading a patrol near Nesle in March 1918 when they were challenged in French. Unfortunately for Webb and his men, the French speakers were German troops. Preferring to avoid unnecessary injury or death, Webb surrendered. He saw out the duration as a prisoner of war in Mainz, Germany. While awaiting repatriation, he received a letter from the chairman of Brighton & Hove Albion offering him the post of team manager, an appointment he took up on his demobilisation in 1919. Managerial career The club had closed down during the war, so Webb's first task was not only rebuilding the team but also involving himself with rebuilding the ground. Competition resumed in 1919‚Äì20, and the following season, Webb led the team into the Football League as a Third Division was formed largely comprising the Southern League First Division teams of the year before. Awarded a testimonial in recognition of his service to the club, Webb chose the League game against Watford in April 1921 as his benefit match; it attracted more than 10,000 spectators and raised nearly ¬£500. In the 1923‚Äì24 FA Cup, Webb led Albion to the fifth round (last 16), defeating First Division Everton on the way in what he later described as \\"the best Cup exhibition of any Albion team under my management\\".Carder & Harris, Seagulls!, p. 80. He earned a reputation as a sound judge of a player. Immediately after the war, the signing of former England international forward George Holley for a club record ¬£200 fee was viewed as quite a coup. Holley suffered a career-ending injury, so hardly played, but Webb replaced him with Jack Doran who finished as the club's top scorer despite joining halfway through the season.Carder & Harris, Seagulls!, pp. 68‚Äì70. He brought Tommy Cook through from the juniors into the first team; Cook was top scorer in three seasons, but when he left the club to concentrate on his cricket career, Webb brought in the Queens Park Rangers reserve Hugh Vallance, who turned out to be a \\"goalscoring phenomenon\\" alongside Dan Kirkwood.Carder & Harris, Seagulls!, p. 91. Again, when twice top scorer Arthur Attwood succumbed to appendicitis in 1933, Webb signed former Norwich City centre-forward Oliver \\"Buster\\" Brown who had failed to break into the first team at West Ham United; with regular football at Albion, Brown produced 41 goals in his first two seasons.Carder & Harris, Seagulls!, p. 102. Between the wars, Webb's teams finished in the top five of the Third Division South on ten occasions, but challenged seriously for promotion only in the latter half of the 1930s. He led the team to third place in 1936‚Äì37, despite an uneasy relationship with the club's board, the supporters, and the press. The board came under criticism for alleged interference in team affairs, having undue influence over the manager in pressing the claims for selection of one player over another. Letters to the local press suggested that Webb should \\"be allowed greater freedom\\",Carder & Harris, Seagulls!, p. 110. while in the Evening Argus, the pseudonymous \\"Crusader\\"'s \\"vitriolic attacks on the directors and management of Brighton and Hove Albion for their alleged lack of ambition and inept team selections ... generated a massive readership response\\" and led to \\"near physical confrontations with Charlie Webb, the beleaguered manager and former Albion player, despite the team usually finishing in a respectable position in the League table.\\"Hounsome, p. 58. The club's relationship with the local newspaper worsened during the 1937‚Äì38 season, to the extent that \\"Crusader\\" was \\"either banned by the directors or was voluntarily taken off by [the editor]\\".Hounsome, p. 65. Webb himself told the Daily Express: \\"Here you have a town full of people with money, yet hardly one of them will give us a hand. Without attractive new players and a winning team you can't get gates and without gates you can't have money.\\" Nevertheless, the national press recognised his achievements. A Daily Mirror feature in 1939 compared him to George Allison of Arsenal and Frank Buckley of Wolverhampton Wanderers, A Guardian retrospective on the club, written in 1973, described how \\"Brighton had a skilful team usually playing to the top six\\" under Webb, \\"whose transfer acquisitions were as often as not costed on the price of his train ticket and buffet sandwiches\\". Second World War and after No longer of an age for active service, Webb joined the Home Guard during the war. Albion continued to compete in the various wartime leagues, and Webb skilfully exploited the regulations allowing players to make guest appearances for the club nearest to their base. He was particularly fortunate that the King's Liverpool Regiment's posting to Newhaven in 1941 gave him the pick of Liverpool F.C.'s pre-war team.Carder & Harris, Seagulls!, pp. 117‚Äì119. In their absence, he was reduced to selecting youngsters or soliciting members of the crowd to make up the numbers, as at Norwich City at Christmas 1940, when his travelling party of one senior player and three amateurs was supplemented by Jimmy Ithell of Bolton Wanderers, Norwich City juniors and local servicemen; Albion lost 18‚Äì0.Camillin & Weir, p. 39. At the end of the 1946‚Äì47 season, at the age of 60, Webb handed over responsibility for team affairs to former player Tommy Cook, remaining with the club on the administrative side, as secretary and general manager. A few days after a 4‚Äì0 home defeat to Walsall left Albion at the bottom of the table, provoking a demonstration after the match, the directors appointed Don Welsh as secretary- manager. Webb stayed on until the end of the 1947‚Äì48 season to assist his successor, then left the club and retired from football.Carder & Harris, Seagulls!, p. 134. Such was Webb's standing in the game that he was awarded a second testimonial. In September 1949, Portsmouth, reigning Football League title-holders, though unable to field a full first team because \\"[their] dressing-room [was] like a hospital\\", beat Arsenal, their predecessors as champions, by two goals to one in \\"an exhibition of memorable football\\" at the Goldstone Ground.Carder & Harris, Seagulls!, p. 139. After his retirement, he wrote a regular column in the Sussex Daily News. Webb continued living in the Frith Road house until shortly before his death in a Hove nursing home in 1973, at the age of 86.Vinicombe, p. 55. Personal life, character and legacy Webb was married to Minnie for more than 60 years. Their son, Ken, was married with a child and employed by the local newspaper, the Evening Argus, when he was killed while training as a pilot in the Second World War.Hounsome, p. 72. Their daughter, Joyce ‚Äì born on the same day as the 1910 Charity ShieldVinicombe, p. 20. ‚Äì survived her parents. She spoke on screen at the football club's centenary evening, at which her father was one of 24 former players and managers nominated as \\"legends\\" and profiled in the commemorative volume, and, in 2003, unveiled a memorial plaque on the former family home in Frith Road. According to Jess Willard, one of Webb's post- Second World War signings, \\"everybody called him Mr Webb because he was a perfect gentleman\\". A 1929 feature on the club in the Sussex County Magazine spoke of him as \\"one of the most dominating personalities associated with the club\\", discharging his managerial duties \\"with such conspicuous success\\" while remaining \\"genial and popular with directors, players and public alike\\".

The building is located on the Koorstraat (choir street). It is mostly closed in the winter and open for tourists in the summer months or by appointment. History Organ The Grote Kerk (1470‚Äì1498), dedicated to St Lawrence, is a handsome building and contains the tomb of Floris V, Count of Holland (d. 1296), a brass of 1546, and some paintings (1507). Anna Visscher is buried in this church. The church was designed by Anthonius Keldermans (c. 1440‚Äì1512), from a church building family from Mechelen.website \\"Stichting Behoud Monumentale Kerken Alkmaar\\" - Historie  Organs  Koororgel, Grote Kerk, Alkmaar The two organs are world-famous. The smaller one, called the \\"Koororgel\\" (choir organ), was built in 1511 by Jan van Covelens, and is built against the North wall of the church. It is the oldest playable organ in the Netherlands. The larger organ at the west end of the church is one of the most famous, significant and beautiful organs in the world. It was built by Jacobus Caltus van Hagerbeer, finished in 1645. The magnificent casework, which unusually stretches from floor to vault and makes the organ part of the architecture of the church, was designed by Jacob van Campen, a leading architect of the time. The enormous canvas shutters were painted by Caesar van Everdingen. The organ was rebuilt in 1723 by Frans Caspar Schnitger. He left the casework much as it was, but created an organ in the North German style within the old case. He reused much of the old fluework, but all the mixtures and reeds were new. The organ has not been changed much since then, and is rare in that 90 percent of the original material, pipework, action, soundboards, case, survives. As such it is one of the most important organs in the world. It is the subject of a documentary made in 2013 and released on DVD by Fugue State Films as \\"Alkmaar: The Organs of the Laurenskerk\\".

She saw her previous life as shallow and unfulfilling. According to her family, she stopped going to nightclubs, began reading literature and watching classic films. In 1998, she went to India with her sister, Kumari, to find herself. While in Goa, she met 22-year-old Yaniv Malka, a near-penniless former Israeli soldier and she became infatuated with him. They moved in together a day after meeting. When Kumari returned to London, Malka and Simmons moved to Berlin where they worked on a fruit juice stall. However, the reality of life in the German capital, so different from the idyllic time on Goa, soon lost its lustre. In June 1998, Simmons returned to London alone. Malka rang her and threatened to kill himself unless she agreed to see him. On the night before they met, she told her father, John, \\"He's a loser. I don't want to end up with a loser. He cannot look after himself - how can he look after me?\\" On 13 June 1998, Malka arrived in London and Simmons spent the day with him. They went to a flat in Islington, north London, borrowed from a friend. The next day, Simmons's naked body was discovered hanging in the shower. She had been strangled and then hanged by a leather strap in the bathroom. The rest of the flat was awash with blood. Later that day, police spent 90 minutes persuading Malka not to jump from the fifth floor ledge of a student hall of residence at University College, London. Taken into custody, he claimed her death was part of a joint suicide pact. He said that they had sex and then she begged him to strangle her. On 29 March 1999, Malka was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of Kadamba Simmons.Model murderer jailed for life BBC News March 29, 1999, retrieved January 23, 2011 He remained impassive as the judge passed sentence.

Playing career During his playing days Hill played for Nuneaton Borough, Christchurch United in New Zealand, Northampton Town, Watford and Oxford United. In his time at Northampton, Hill scored 33 league and cup goals in one season, winning the golden boot for finishing as the club's top goal scorer. Hill was transferred from Northampton Town to Watford for a Fourth Division record fee of ¬£258,000. He was the last signing made by Graham Taylor before his departure from Watford to manage Aston Villa at the end of the 1986‚Äì87 season. He did not feature in the plans of incoming manager Dave Bassett and consequently, his stay at Vicarage Road was brief only appearing 4 times: he was transferred to Oxford United for ¬£260,000. Hill had to finish his playing career early due to a serious knee injury, but having amassed 69 goals from just 171 Football League games. Managerial career Since retiring from playing Hill has been assistant manager to John Gregory at both Wycombe Wanderers and Queens Park Rangers, Brian Little at Aston Villa, Martin Wilkinson at Northampton Town, Andy Hessenthaler at Gillingham, Tranmere Rovers and was first-team coach at Reading.

In his first season, he led Eastleigh to the Conference South Play Off Semi Finals. At the start of the 2013‚Äì14 season Eastleigh were big favourites to win the league. Under HIll's guidance he led Eastleigh to the Conference South title and promotion in the 2013‚Äì14 season. The 2014‚Äì15 season saw Eastleigh in the Conference Premier, the highest level of football the club had ever competed at, with Hill taking Eastleigh to the Play Off Semi Finals at the end of that season. During his initial spell as manager of Eastleigh, Hill achieved a win ratio of 62%. Hill resigned at Eastleigh on 23 September 2015 after just over 3 years in the job, following a run of five games without a win, culminating in a 5‚Äì2 defeat to Dover Athletic. Leaving the club, Hill said it felt like a break-up, and it was time for a change for both himself and the club. On 9 September 2016, Hill returned to management, replacing Pablo Asensio as boss of National League South club Whitehawk. On 29 November 2016 Hill left Whitehawk and joined Aston Villa to be part of Steve Bruce's recruitment staff.

History  The team was made up of former members and players of the club SG Union Obersch√∂neweide, predecessor of current-day club 1. FC Union Berlin, who left the Soviet- occupied eastern half of the city when clubs located there were denied the opportunity to take part in citywide and national championships and were instead made part of the separate football competition that was emerging in East Germany. Originally based in the Poststadion in Moabit, the club soon took up residence at Wrangelstra√üe to better accommodate club members living in Kreuzberg and K√∂penick. The team first advanced to the Amateurliga Berlin (II) in 1954 for a three season turn. They were absent from upper level play through the 1960s until returning to now third tier Amateurliga play in 1969. They delivered their best performances in the early 1970s when the side included a number of former players from one time Bundesliga (I) club Tasmania Berlin, who were nearing the end of their careers. The team captured the Amateurliga title in 1973 and won promotion to the Regionalliga Berlin (II). That title also earned BBC a place in the opening round of the national amateur championship where they were put out (1‚Äì4, 1‚Äì1) by B√ºdelsdorfer TSV. The team's Regionalliga season ended with a 9th-place finish and relegation. After two poor Amateurliga campaigns, S√ºdost slipped out of sight into lower level play before being disbanded in 1990.

La Borde patented the site of 145 acres on March 1, 1848. The site was expanded after the sale of initial lots. A land survey was made on July 17, 1849. The lots were uniform in measurement, 66 feet wide by 132 feet deep. The main street of Broadway measured 82 1/2 feet wide. All other streets were 66 feet wide. Water, Union, Washington, Liberty, Grand, Ann, Broad, Harrison, Howard, Pearl, Main, and Menominee streets are listed in a Winnebago County platbook dated 1889.Digicoll Library Wisc Edu - 1889 Plat of Delhi The site was used by regional Indians as a burial ground. The settlers of Delhi often found the Indian burials while spring plowing. Their findings included pottery, beads, guns, copper, and other objects. Oshkosh Public Museum owns many of the relics. Delhi was a preferred trading post for the local Indians and residents of Eureka and Omro. La Borde built a float bridge for the use of Poygan, Winneconne, and Rushford settlers on their way to the gristmills at Waukau. In addition to being a trading post, Delhi had 3 stores, 2 grain mills, 3 hop mills and hop press, and a saw mill. Boats and furniture were crafted in Delhi. It had a livery, a schoolhouse, a 22 room hotel, and a bar. The hops were grown and pressed in Delhi then shipped to Oshkosh and Milwaukee. Years later, a dock was built. Steamboats made regular stops in Delhi. A small stagecoach from Oshkosh to Omro, Eureka, and other locations stopped daily in Delhi delivering passengers and mail. Delhi was slowly abandoned and then deteriorated. It had considered itself to be a strong contender for county seat over Omro and Eureka. Trade shifted to Omro and Eureka when those villages built better bridges than Delhi could afford. The railroad came to Omro causing further diversion of trade. Delhi's residents moved to the neighboring villages and beyond. Today, only one deteriorated house stands from that era. Luke La Borde and his wife, Louisa, are buried on the property.

He was best known as a cinema architect, having designed many picture houses in the 1930s for the Shipman and King cinema circuit. He was a committed Christian, abstainer and vegetarian. Architectural work Rex Cinema in Berkhamsted (1937) Nye's only theatre project, the 1937 Embassy Theatre in Peterborough In 1930 he was awarded the first scholarship by the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, through which he learned about the restoration of ancient buildings. Nye set up his own practice in 1931, initially working as honorary architect to the Essex Rural Community Council in Maldon, Essex. He was responsible for the 1932 restoration work on Thomas Plume's Library. It was in Maldon that he secured his first cinema project, designing the Embassy Cinema for the Shipman & King cinema circuit, which was erected on Maldon High Street in 1936. The Embassy was demolished in 1987 to make way for a sheltered housing complex, Embassy Court. Nye continued his association with Shipman & King for another 9 years, designing over 40 cinemas. His most renowned cinema design was possibly the Rex, Berkhamsted, an Art Deco picture house designed in 1937 with a nautical theme, featuring decorations of waves, shells and portholes. The Rex was eventually turned into a bingo hall and then closed in 1988, but the building was listed Grade II by English Heritage, preserving it from demolition by property developers. A local campaign to restore the Rex succeeded and in 2004 it was re-opened as an independent cinema. During World War II Nye served in the Royal Navy. After the war, he began his work as an architect again, specialising in church building and restoration. He designed the church of St Faith's Church, Dulwich in the mid-1950s. He was appointed Architect to the Diocese of Southwark and Architect and Surveyor to Guildford Cathedral. His practice also carried out restoration work for the National Trust and was responsible for the reconstruction of All Hallows, London Wall after wartime bombing and the new Pewterers' Hall in Oat Lane in the City in 1960. Nye was chairman of SPAB‚Äôs Technical panel for several years. The Architects' Practice of Nye, Saunders and Partners, based in Godalming, Surrey, was formed in 1971 following the merger of David Evelyn Nye & Partners with A.E.F. Saunders and Associates, and today the Nye Saunders practice continues to specialise in church and historic building conservation.

As there is no permanent transportation road to the field, production is carried out only during the winter time, which allows usage of ice roads. The permanent road to the field will be built in 2011. Commercial production is expected to start in late 2015 or early 2016.

Here he employed himself in educating students for the ministry, probably with the concurrence of the \\"provincial meeting\\" of Cumberland and Westmorland. In 1700 he was chosen as colleague to John Chorlton at Cross Street Chapel, Manchester. He shared with Chorlton the tutorial work of the Manchester academy, and on Chorlton's death (1705) carried it on for seven years without assistance. His most distinguished pupils were Samuel Bourn the younger and John Turner of Preston, famous for his exertions against the rebel army in the 1715 Jacobite uprising. During the reign of Queen Anne, Coningham was several times prosecuted for keeping an academy; and though a man who combined orthodoxy with a broad spirit, he was not strong enough to cope with the divergences of theological opinion in his flock. He left Manchester for London in 1712, being called to succeed Richard Stretton, M.A. (died 3 July 1712, aged 80), at Haberdashers' Hall. His health was broken, and he died on 1 September 1716.

Volunteer Artillery 1859-1908 The enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many Volunteer units composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular British Army in time of need.Beckett.Spiers, pp. 163‚Äì168. In November that year the Earl of Ducie, Lord Lieutenant of Gloucestershire, organised a unit of Gloucestershire Artillery Volunteers in Bristol under the command of Major Henry Bourchier Osborne Savile, a former Royal Artillery officer. The Society of Merchant Venturers in Bristol provided land in Whiteladies Road, Clifton, to build its headquarters (HQ), known as 'the Artillery Grounds'. Four smoothbore 18-pounder guns were obtained from Woolwich and arrived in Bristol in April 1860. Further Artillery Volunteer Corps (AVCs) were quickly organised in the county of Gloucestershire and in 1863 they were brigaded together with those from neighbouring Somerset (dates are those of the first officers' commissions):Beckett, Appendix VIII.Frederick, pp. 658‚Äì659.

A Cadet Corps with HQ at Bristol also existed from 1880 to 1884. The 1st Gloucester AVC was assigned to the Welsh Division of the Royal Artillery (RA) on 1 April 1882, changing to the Western Division on 1 July 1889. By 1893 the War Office Mobilisation Scheme had allocated the 1st Gloucestershire Artillery Volunteers to the Plymouth fixed defences.Mobilization Tables for Home Defence, List of Militia, Yeomanry and Volunteer Units, HMSO, London, 1893 Frederick Cusac Ord, a former captain in the Royal Artillery, was appointed Major on 25 April 1885, became Lt-Col commanding on 7 December 1889 and Lt-Col Commandant on 1 April 1891.

It then joined the concentration of the South Midland Division around Chelmsford, where it formed part of Central Force. On the outbreak of war, units of the TF were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service. On 15 August 1914, the War Office issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form these into reserve units. On 31 August, the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix. In this way duplicate battalions, brigades and divisions were created, mirroring those TF formations being sent overseas.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6. =1/I South Midland Brigade= 18-pounder gun preserved at the Imperial War Museum. The South Midland Division was ordered to France on 13 March 1915, and the artillery embarked at Southampton for Le Havre on 29 March, disembarkation being complete by 1 April. By 4 April the division had taken over a section of the front line near Neuve Eglise in Belgium. It was redesignated 48th (South Midland) Division on 12 May 1915. The batteries were re-equipped with modern 18-pounder guns on 21 July.Farndale, Western Front, p. 94. The brigade was redesignated CCXL Brigade, RFA, (240 Bde) on 18 May 1916. At the same time the batteries were redesignated A, B and C, a new D Bty having already been formed on 3 April. D Battery with its 18-pounders was then swapped for D (Howitzer) Bty of CCXLIII (IV South Midland) Bde. This battery had previously been 4th Warwickshire Bty, and was equipped with 4.5-inch howitzers. Brigade Ammunition Columns were also abolished at this time. On 18 October 1916 the 18-pounder batteries were brought up to six-gun strength when the brigade's former D Bty (now A/CCXLIII) returned and half of C/CCXLIII Bty joined. Similarly, D (H) Bty was brought up to a strength of six howitzers when half of C (H)/CCXLII (III South Midland) Bty joined on 16 January 1917.Frederick, p. 692. CCXL Bde supported 48th Division in the following actions: 4.5-inch howitzer at the Royal Artillery Museum. 1916 * Battle of the Somme ** Battle of Albert (1 July) ** Battle of Bazentin Ridge (15‚Äì17 July) ** Capture of Ovillers (17 July) ** Battle of Pozieres Ridge (23‚Äì27 July, 13‚Äì28 August) ** Battle of the Ancre Heights (3‚Äì11 November) ** Battle of the Ancre (13‚Äì18 November) 1917 * German retreat to the Hindenburg Line (Operation Alberich) (14 March‚Äì5 April) ** Occupation of Peronne (18 March) * Third Ypres Offensive ** Battle of Langemarck (16 August) Although this battle was disastrous overall, the artillery support for 48th Division was good and it captured some ground before being held up by a group of fortified farms. On 20 August 48th Division took advantage of a spell of dry weather to attack the troublesome strongpoints that had held them up: Hillock Farm, Maison du Hibou, Triangle Farm and the Cockcroft. Seven tanks moved up the firm St Julien‚ÄìPoelcapelle road covered by a smoke and shrapnel barrage, with a High Explosive (HE) barrage ahead, and subdued the strongpoints that were then captured by infantry platoons. A repeat of this attack two days later was less successful.Edmonds, 1917, Vol II, pp. 199‚Äì202.Farndale, p. 204, Map 27.John Lee, 'The British Divisions at Ypres', in Liddle (ed), pp. 217‚Äì219. ** Battle of Polygon Wood (28 September‚Äì3 October) ** Battle of Broodseinde (4 October) ** Battle of Poelcappelle (9 October) This was the division's last attack on the Western Front. Its role was to advance up a ridge to the outskirts of the village of Passchendaele. Ground conditions were bad, and many batteries were bogged down, so the preparatory barrage was feeble, many of the HE shellbursts being deadened by the mud. Casualties among the gunners were also severe because they were exposed to German observers on the ridge.Wolff, pp. 223‚Äì235.John Lee, 'The British Divisions at Third Ypres' in Liddle (ed), p. 221.Ashley Eakins, 'The Australians at Passchendaele', in Liddle (ed), pp. 239‚Äì240.

Entrainment began on 21 November and by 1 December the division concentrated round Legnago in the Adige Sector. On 1 March 1918 the division relieved 7th Division in the front line of the Montello sector on the Piave Front, and held the line until 16 March. On 1 April it moved westward into reserve for the middle sector of the Asiago Plateau Front. It remained in Italy for the remainder of the war, taking part in the following operations:Farndale, Western Front, p. 213.Wolff, p. 253. 1918 * Battle of the Piave River: ** Fighting on the Asiago Plateau, 15‚Äì16 June 1918 * Battle of Vittorio Veneto: ** Fighting in the Val d'Assa, 1‚Äì4 November 1918 On 3 November 1918, at Osteria del Termine, the division surrounded and captured a large force of Austrian troops including the corps commander and three divisional commanders. By 15.00 on 4 November, when the Armistice with Austria came into force, the division had pushed forward into the Trentino. After the conclusion of hostilities the division was withdrawn to Italy for the winter. Demobilisation began in 1919 and was complete by 31 March. =2/I South Midland Brigade= De Bange 90 mm French field gun issued to 2nd Line batteries. The 2nd Line brigade was formed in the autumn of 1914, and in January 1915 it joined the 2nd South Midland Division (later 61st (2nd South Midland) Division) at Northampton. Equipment was scarce, and until the end of 1915 the only guns available for training were obsolete French De Bange 90 mm guns. In January 1916 the brigade received four of the obsolescent 15-pounders that had equipped 1st Line TF units. Finally, as the division prepared to go overseas, modern 18-pounders were issued.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 33‚Äì39.61 (SM) Division at Long, Long Trail. While stationed at Northampton, the division formed part of First Army of Central Force, but once the 48th Division had gone to France, the 61st replaced it around Chelmsford as part of Third Army, Central Force, responsible for coastal defence. In February 1916 the division moved to Salisbury Plain for final battle training. In May it concentrated in the Tidworth‚ÄìBulford area, and on 16/17 May 1916 2/I (SM) brigade was redesignated CCCV Brigade RFA (305 Bde). Entrainment for the embarkation ports began on 21 May and by 28 May the division was in France, concentrated in IX Corps' area behind the front line. The division's first major action was the Attack at Fromelles on 19 July 1916. The artillery preparation had begun the previous day, but the infantry attack was a disaster, the assaulting battalions taking very heavy casualties. 61st Division was only used for trench-holding for the rest of the year. On 16/17 September CCCV (2/I SM) Brigade was broken up among the other artillery brigades of 61st Division to bring them up to 6-gun batteries.Farndale, Western Front, p. 133. Inter War Years When the TF was reconstituted on 7 February 1920 the 1st South Midland Bde reformed with 1st‚Äì3rd Gloucestershire Batteries, joined by the former Berkshire Royal Horse Artillery at Reading as a fourth battery (the Berkshire Bty). The TF was reorganised as the Territorial Army (TA) in 1921 and the unit was redesignated as 66th (South Midland) Brigade, RFA. The brigade continued to form part of 48th (South Midland) Division. The title changed to 66th (South Midland) Field Brigade, RA, in January 1924 when the RFA was subsumed into the RA.Frederick, p. 518.Titles and Designations, 1927. * HQ: Artillery Grounds, Clifton * 261st (Bristol) Field Battery, Clifton * 262nd (Bristol) Field Battery, Clifton * 263rd (Bristol) Field Battery, Clifton * 264th (Berkshire) Field Battery (Howitzers), Yeomanry House, Reading The Clifton College contingent of the Officers' Training Corps (Junior Division) was attached to the unit in the 1930s. =Anti-Aircraft conversion= During the 1930s the increasing need for anti-aircraft (AA) defence for Britain's cities was addressed by converting a number of existing TA units. The 66th (South Midland) Field Brigade was one of the units converted to the AA artillery role on 1 November 1938, becoming 76th (Gloucestershire) Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA. 264 Battery at Reading was separated and expanded to form a new 80th (Berkshire) AA Rgt. The HQ and three remaining batteries (renumbered as 236, 237 and 238 (Bristol) AA Btys) were all based at the Artillery Grounds at Clifton. It formed part of 46th Anti- Aircraft Brigade in 5 AA Division, which provided the AA defence for Bristol, including Bristol Docks and the Bristol Aeroplane Company factory at Filton Aerodrome, a key target.Frederick, pp. 755‚Äì759, 774‚Äì775.5 AA Division 1939 at British Military History.Routledge, Table LX, p. 378.AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files. World War II =Mobilisation= The TA's AA units were mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis, with units manning their emergency positions within 24 hours, even though many did not yet have their full complement of men or equipment. The emergency lasted three weeks, and they were stood down on 13 October.Routledge, pp. 62‚Äì63. In February 1939 the existing AA defences came under the control of a new Anti- Aircraft Command. In June a partial mobilisation of TA units was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA and searchlight positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations, with the eight 3-inch guns of 76th AA Rgt deployed as planned in and around the Bristol Gun Defence Area (GDA) ‚Äì four of them out of action.Routledge, pp. 65‚Äì66, 371, Table LIX, p. 377.46 AA Bde War Diary 1939‚Äì40, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 166/2287. On 11 September 1939 all the available heavy AA (HAA) guns in 46 AA Bde (76th AA Rgt's eight guns) were concentrated to cover Avonmouth Docks. These guns were relocated to Filton Aerodrome in October. In the near-total absence of light AA (LAA) guns, detachments from other units armed with Light machine guns were deployed during October to cover Vulnerable Points (VPs) such as airfields and aircraft factories. 76th AA Regiment manned 16 Lewis guns at Parnall Aircraft, Yate, until they were relieved by 68th (Monmouthshire Regiment) Searchlight Rgt in November. From 1 June 1940 those AA units armed with 3-inch or the more modern 3.7-inch guns were termed 'Heavy AA' (HAA) to distinguish them for the Light AA units then being formed. =Battle of Britain and Blitz= 8 AA Division formation sign. By 11 July 1940, at the start of the Battle of Britain, 5 AA Division had 36 HAA guns deployed at Bristol.Farndale, Years of Defeat, p. 106. Some of the greatest air battles of the Battle of Britain were fought on 15 August, from South Wales to the Yorkshire Coast, when 5 AA Division was hotly engaged, being credited with several 'kills'. Another peak day came on 24 August, when the Bristol gunners were in action again. From 6 September the Luftwaffe switched from bombing airfields to bombing cities, and there was a daylight raid on Bristol on 25 September 1940.Farndale, Years of Defeat, p. 108.Routledge, Table LXII, pp. 379‚Äì80. As AA Command expanded, the regiment formed a new 349 HAA Bty formed on 17 September, and 46 AA Bde transferred to a new 8 AA Division in November.Farndale, Years of Defeat, Annex D.Routledge, Table LXV, p. 96.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/79. Now the night attacks were stepped up against London and other cities, with Bristol receiving frequent raids, particularly heavy in March 1941 (the Bristol Blitz).Routledge, p. 394.Pile's despatch.Collier, Chapter 17.Collier, Appendix XXX. The regiment sent a cadre to 207th Training Regiment at Devizes to provide the basis for a new 425 HAA Bty; this was formed on 24 April 1941 and later joined 126th HAA Rgt. The regiment sent another cadre to 207th HAA Training Regiment to provide the basis for a new 480 (Mixed) HAA Bty, in which women of the Auxiliary Territorial Service were integrated. This battery was formed on 18 September 1941 but was converted to men-only on 15 October before being regimented with 76th HAA Rgt on 9 December. It replaced 238 HAA Bty, which left in October‚ÄìNovember to join the field force under War Office control and later transferred to 83rd (Blythswood) AA Rgt.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-Divisional units), 22 October 1941, TNA files WO 212/6 and WO 33/1883. In the autumn of 1941 the regiment (with 236, 237 and 349 HAA Btys) joined a new 69 AA Bde in 8 AA Division.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/80. =Mobilising for overseas service= The regiment was now prepared for overseas service. This required a war establishment of three batteries, and 480 HAA Bty was reduced back to a cadre on 9 April 1942 to return to Devizes and form a new 480 (Mixed) Bty; this battery eventually joined 162nd HAA Rgt The rest of the regiment had left AA Command by May 1942.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 14 May 1942, TNA file WO 212/81. By September 1942 it had come under War Office Control, with its own Royal Corps of Signals Section and Royal Army Ordnance Corps Workshop Section.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-Divisional units), 2 April 1942, with amendments, TNA files WO 212/515. It was joined by a Royal Army Service Corps transport platoon in the autumn of 1942 and was now ready for overseas service as a mobile unit.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-Divisional Units), 22 November 1942, TNA file WO 212/8. =Tunisia= In October 1942 the advance parties of the regiment sailed for North Africa as part of Operation Torch, and began unloading their equipment in Algiers harbour soon after it was secured on 9 November. However, the HAA units had not been 'combat loaded' and it took some time to assemble the 3.7-inch guns, vehicles and equipment and deploy to engage the Luftwaffe air attacks that quickly developed against the port and nearby airfields. It was not until the end of the year that the regiment was at full strength, but by mid-January 1943 it had a battery in action at Algiers port, and troops at Maison Blanche and Blida airfields, all under 62 AA Bde. These were regularly attacked by German bombers flying from Sicily and Sardinia. On one occasion, 13 Allied aircraft were destroyed and many damaged during a night raid on Maison Blanche. As the campaign developed and First Army advanced eastwards, the regiment had full batteries deployed in 'Inner Artillery Zones' (IAZs) at Algiers, Bougie and Djidjelli by mid-March. In these positions the gunners found that the performance of their gun-laying (GL) radar sets was degraded by nearby hills and it was difficult to engage 'unseen' targets.Joslen, p. 465.Routledge, pp. 178‚Äì185; Table XXX, p. 188; Table XXXI, p. 189.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, pp. 146, 174, 252‚Äì253. By late April, 62 AA Bde had been relieved round Algiers by US Army units, and was able to move up behind First Army. 76th HAA Regiment now joined 52 AA Bde, which consisted of a mobile AA force for the final push in Tunisia (Operation Vulcan). These units were ready to move into Tunis and Bizerta immediately behind the leading battle groups. Despite German counter-attacks, 'Vulcan' was launched on 6 May and in the afternoon of 7 May Allied troops entered the two cities and 52 AA Bde was called forward. In fact, enemy combat troops were still holding out, and at Bizerta the AA advance parties came under shellfire from outside the town. Once the last resistance had been flushed out, 76 HAA Rgt deployed in the Bizerta IAZ. Because of the port's vital importance for the assembly and despatch of forces for the Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky) this became the largest British AA commitment in the theatre.Routledge, pp. 185‚Äì186; Table XXXII, p. 190.Playfair & Molony, Vol IV, p. 453. =Sicily= The assault landings on Sicily began on 10 July 1943, Syracuse was entered that night, and 62 AA Bde HQ landed there on 17 July, bringing with it batteries from 76th HAA and other regiments, which were dispersed and deployed where required. The vital harbours at Syracuse and Augusta received constant raids from Luftwaffe bombers and fighters by day and night, with the AA gunners scoring several 'kills'. By D+28 (7 August), 76th HAA Rgt was deployed round Syracuse with 236 HAA Bty detached to Augusta.Joslen, p. 466.Molony, Vol V, pp. 59‚Äì64, 81.Routledge, pp. 261‚Äì3; Table XLII, p. 267. =Italy= 3.7-inch AA gun in action in the field artillery role in Italy. Messina fell on 17 August, completing the capture of Sicily, and the Allies moved quickly to the invasion of the Italian mainland, beginning with Eighth Army crossing the Straits of Messina on 3 September (Operation Baytown). 62 AA Brigade HQ followed on 29 September, taking 76 HAA Rgt with it. Travelling by road, it crossed Italy and reached Bari on 2 October, it relieved the AA units there to follow the advance and took over defence of Bari harbour, Barletta and Manfredonia on the coast, and a complex of inland airfields. The ports were important for Eighth Army's supplies, and were targeted by the Luftwaffe. On the night of 2/3 December there was an Air raid on Bari covered by clouds of 'Window' (known as D√ºppel to the Luftwaffe). Not only were the Royal Air Force and Royal Artillery radar stations blinded, but communications broke down between the two services and defensive fire only began as the first bombs fell. The guns claimed three bombers shot down. The bombers had been aided by the port working under full lighting, and the damage to shipping and stores was increased by the explosion of an ammunition vessel.Joslen, p. 467.Molony, Vol V, pp. 182, 413‚Äì414.Routledge, pp. 265, 269, 274‚Äì275, 281. Shortly after the Bari raid, 62 AA Bde HQ and 76 HAA Rgt were relieved and moved on up the eastern side of the Italian peninsula behind Eighth Army, crossing to join US Fifth Army in April 1944. Initially it was involved in airfield defence, but after Fifth Army's capture of Rome in June 1944 it deployed to defend the bridges over the Tiber and the port of Piombino. Then when relieved it was able to follow close behind Fifth Army. Although the Luftwaffe's losses meant the air threat was lowered, HAA batteries of 62 AA Bde also employed their versatile long-range 3.7-inch guns in a medium artillery role against ground targets. This included counter-battery (CB), defensive fire (DF) and harassing fire (HF) shoots, but also air-burst shoots against entrenched positions, and destruction of hard targets such as buildings.Routledge, pp. 275, 279‚Äì81, 284‚Äì5; Table XLIV, p. 293. Once Fifth Army had crossed the Arno, it faced the Serchio and the defences of the Gothic Line. On 26 December the German forces put in a major counterattack, Unternehmen Wintergewitter (Operation Winter Storm), between Lucca and Pistoia aimed at retaking the port of Livorno (Leghorn). 62 AA Brigade was well to the front in the resulting Battle of Garfagnana, with LAA regiments acting as infantry and anti-tank gunners, while the HAA regiments acted as divisional medium artillery. 76th HAA Regiment answered 181 calls for fire with 4995 rounds fired. Having beaten off the attack, IV US Corps advanced into the mountains. There was little activity by the Luftwaffe, so the ample stocks of 3.7-inch AA ammunition were used for all kinds of engagements. By the end of February 1945, 62 AA had been reduced to just two regiments ‚Äì of which 76th was one ‚Äì with only one battery on AA tasks.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt III, pp. 126‚Äì129.Routledge, Table XLVI, p. 295.Routledge, p. 285; Table XLVII, pp. 296‚Äì297. Fifteenth Army Group (British Eighth and US Fifth Armies) launched its final offensive (Operation Grapeshot) on 6 April 1945 and the Italian Campaign ended shortly afterwards. 76th (Gloucester) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment and its three batteries were placed in suspended animation on 24 November 1945.Jackson, Vol VI, Pt III, pp. 253‚Äì333. Post-war When the TA was reconstituted on 1 January 1947 the regiment was reformed as 266 (Gloucestershire Volunteer Artillery) HAA Rgt, RA in 72 AA Bde (the former 46 AA Bde at Bristol).Frederick, p. 999. (On 1 April 1947 the Regular Army's 1st HAA Rgt took the GVA's old number and became 76 HAA Rgt.Frederick, p. 957.) When AA Command was disbanded in 1955 there were wholesale mergers among its units. 266 HAA Regiment was amalgamated with 312 (Gloucestershire) and 601 (City of Bristol) HAA Rgts to form 'P' (Gloucestershire Volunteer Artillery) Battery in the new 311 (City of Bristol) HAA Rgt. In 1961 that regiment was merged into 883 (Bristol) Locating Battery to form 883 (Gloucestershire Volunteer Artillery) Locating Battery.Frederick, pp. 1004, 1032.289‚Äì322 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on592‚Äì638 Regiments at British Army 1945 on871‚Äì895 Batteries at British Army 1945 on A further reorganisation in 1967 saw the battery converted to infantry as 'A' (Gloucestershire Volunteer Artillery) Squadron in the Royal Gloucestershire Hussars. This regiment was reduced to a cadre at Bristol in 1969, but two years later 266 (Gloucestershire Volunteer Artillery) OP Battery was reformed from the cadre as an independent Observation Post unit as a reinforcement unit for BAOR supplying observation post teams. In 1999 this re-roled as a field battery in 100th (Yeomanry) Regiment Royal Artillery as the TA battery supporting 7 Para RHA and 29 Commando Regiment. The Romford based 289th Parachute Troop, Royal Artillery formed part of the battery from 1999 to 2007. Under Army 2020 plans, 266th Battery re-roled to Mini Unmanned Air Systems was assigned to 104th Regiment Royal Artillery. Uniforms and insignia The original officers' uniform of the 1st Gloucestershire AVC was a long-skirted blue tunic with scarlet cuffs, collar and edging, five rows of black braid across the front and black Austrian knots on the sleeves. Other ranks wore a blue tunic with black Austrian knots. A peaked forage cap was worn with a silver grenade on the front, with white waist and cross belts. A busby became the full dress headgear in the 1860s and was worn until 1908. During the period 1908‚Äì19, the Gloucester TF batteries wore a brass shoulder title, 'T/RFA/GLOSTER', while the brigade ammunition column wore 'T/RFA/S.MIDLAND'. However at some point the batteries wore a non-regulation embroidered shoulder title 'GLOS/RFA/T', in red on a dark blue backing. From 1961 to 1967, 883 Locating Battery wore an embroidered title 'GLOUCESTERSHIRE/VOLUNTEER ARTILLERY' in red on dark blue. This remained in wear for A (GVA) Squadron, Royal Gloucestershire Hussars from 1967 to 1971. In 1971 the reformed 266 OP Battery introduced a black embroidered slip-on title 'G.V.A.' worn on the shoulder straps of the barrack jersey; other ranks wore the title in white metal.

Life Slanning was the eldest son of Sir Nicholas Slanning and his wife Gertrude (n√™e Bagge), daughter of Sir James Bagge. History of Parliament Online - Slanning, Sir Nicholas, 1st Bt. His father was killed in 1643 fighting for the Royalist cause in the Civil War. His mother remarried Richard Arundell, 1st Baron Arundell of Trerice. After the Restoration of Charles II Slanning was knighted in 1661 and made a baronet in 1663. His first marriage into the influential Cartaret family brought him for a time into the inner Court circle. He was appointed Cupbearer to Queen Catherine of Braganza (1663) and Commissioner for Assessment for Cornwall (1661‚Äì1678), Devon (1661‚Äì1662, 1665‚Äì1680). He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1664. Like his father he had some interest in chemistry. In 1669, Slanning was elected Member of Parliament for Plympton Erle in the Cavalier Parliament. He was a diligent MP, sitting on some 70 committees. He was elected MP for Penrhyn in 1679 and in 1681 and 1685. He was expelled from the Royal Society in 1682. He was appointed Standard-bearer to the Band of Gentleman-pensioners (1676‚Äì1684), Commissioner for Rebels' Estates, Devon (1686), Vice-Warden of the Stanneries (1686-death) and Deputy-Governor of Plymouth (1688). He was Commissioner for Assessment for Cornwall and Devon from 1689 to 1690. He supported the Glorious Revolution, but retired from politics the following year. Slanning died in Tamerton Foliot, Devon in 1691. Family Slanning married four times: firstly in 1662 Anne (died 1668), daughter of Sir George Carteret, Bt, of St Owen's, Jersey, Treasurer of the Navy and his wife Elizabeth. Anne was remembered as a \\"pious and sweet-tempered lady\\": Samuel Pepys refers to her affectionately in his celebrated Diary. He married secondly in 1670 Mary, daughter of James Jenkin of Treseny, St Columb Major, Cornwall, thirdly in 1673 Mary, and daughter of Sir Andrew Henley, 1st Baronet, of Henley, Somerset, and his first wife Mary Gayer. Mary Henley was the mother of his only son, Andrew. He married fourthly in 1679 Amy, widow of Sir John Davie, 2nd Baronet, and also of Walter Hele of Newton Ferrers, and daughter of Edmond Parker of Boringdon Hall, Plympton, Devon. His only son, Sir Andrew Slanning, inherited his title. Andrew was murdered by John Cowland in 1700, following a drunken brawl in the Rose Tavern, Convent Garden, and the title died with him. The Slanning estates passed to the heirs of Sir Nicholas's sister Elizabeth, Lady Modyford.

Life Condell was baptised at the end of 1757 at St Martin-in-the-Fields, London, the son of John Condell and his partner Ann Wilson. He first performed in public in 1771, on the harpsichord. Around 1800 Condell was a prominent member of the orchestras of the King's Theatre, Drury Lane, and Covent Garden. He died at Cave House, Battersea, after a long illness, on 24 June 1824. Works In 1803 Condell wrote an overture to William Dimond's historical play The Hero of the North (produced at Drury Lane 19 February 1803), and in 1804 for John Fawcett's ballet The Enchanted Island, played at the Haymarket Theatre. In 1803 he set the musical farce Who wins, or the Widow's Choice (Covent Garden, 25 February). In 1810 he wrote music for Frederic Reynolds's Bridal Ring (Covent Garden, 16 October) In the same year Transformation, ascribed to John Till Allingham, with music by Condell, was produced by the Drury Lane company at the Lyceum Theatre (30 November). Condell also wrote overtures to The House to be sold (probably Michael Kelly's opera played at Drury Lane in 1802), and to Love laughs at Locksmiths; and incidental music in Aladdin, performed at Covent Garden, a set of six songs dedicated to Lady Lake, and some harpsichord duets.

It was the first edition of the Vulgate authorised by a pope. Its official recognition was short-lived; the edition was replaced in 1592 by the Sixto-Clementine Vulgate. In 1546, the Council of Trent had decreed that the Vulgate was authoritative and authentic, and ordered that the Vugate be printed as correctly as possible. No edition of the Vulgate officially approved by the Catholic Church existed at the time. Twenty years later, work to produce an official edition of the Vulgate began: Pius V appointed a commission to produce an official edition of the Vulgate. However, his successor, Gregory XIII, did not continue the work. In 1586, Sixtus V appointed a commission to produce an official edition of the Vulgate. However, he was dissatisfied with the work of the commission. Considering himself a very competent editor, he edited the Vulgate with the help of a few people he trusted. In 1590, this edition was published and was preceded by a bull of Sixtus V saying this edition was the authentic edition recommended by the Council of Trent, that it should be taken as the standard of all future reprints, and that all copies should be corrected by it. Three months later, in August, Sixtus V died. Nine days after the death of Sixtus V, the College of Cardinals suspended the sale of the Sixtine Vulgate and later ordered the destruction of the copies. In 1592, Clement VIII, arguing printing errors in the Sixtine Vulgate, recalled all copies of the Sixtine Vulgate still in circulation; some suspect his decision was in fact due to the influence of the Jesuits. In November of the same year, a revised version of the Sixtine, known as the Sixto-Clementine Vulgate or Clementine Vulgate, was issued by Clement VIII to replace the Sixtine Vulgate.  History  = Council of Trent = The Council of Trent decreed the Vulgate authoritative and \\"authentic\\" on 8 April 1546, and ordered it to be printed \\"quam emendatissime\\" (\\"with the fewest possible faults\\"). There was no authoritative edition of the Vulgate in the Catholic Church at that time; that would come in May (or April) 1590. = Elaboration of the text =  Three pontifical commissions  Three pontifical commissions were successively charged to elaborate the text of the edition of the Vulgate for which the Council of Trent had requested publication. Up until the commissions of Pius V and Sixtus V, the work was done without any coordination. After Sixtus V's death in 1590, two other commissions were organised, one after the other, under Gregory XIV in 1591. = Pius IV's commission = In 1561, Pius IV created a commission at Rome composed of four cardinals: Amulio, Morone, Scotti and Vitelli. This committee had only a very general role: to correct and print the ecclesiastical books which the Holy See had decided to reform or publish. = Pius V's commission = In 1566 or 1569, another commission was appointed by Pope Pius V (Congregatio pro emendatione Bibliorum) to produce an official edition of the Vulgate. This commission was composed of five cardinals (M. A. Colonna, G. Sirleto, C. Madruzzo, J. Souchier, and Antonio Carafa) and twelve advisors. Gregory XIII did not appoint a commission for the Vulgate, and soon Gugliemo Sirleto \\"was the only one remaining to take care of the revision\\" of the Vulgate in Rome. Gregory XIII issued a commission for the emendation of the LXX after being convinced to do so by Cardinal Montalto (the future Sixtus V). Thomson states that the commission working on the Vulgate had to stop its work to instead work on the edition of the Septuagint. The work on this edition was finished in 1586 and the edition, known as the Roman Septuagint, was published the next year. This edition of the Septuagint was done to assist the revisers of the Latin Vulgate. = Sixtus V's commission = At the time Sixtus V became pope, in 1585, work on the edition of the Vulgate had barely begun.Page of the Codex Carafianus In 1586, Sixtus V appointed a commission. The commission was under the presidency of Cardinal Carafa, and was composed of Flaminius Nobilius, Antonius Agellius, Lelio Landi, Bartholomew Valverde, and Petrus Morinus. They were helped by Fulvio Orsini. The commission worked on the basis of the 1583 edition by Franciscus Lucas Brugensis of the Leuven Vulgate and \\"[g]ood manuscripts were used as authorities, including notably the Codex Amiatinus.\\" The commission wrote annotations and corrected directly on an exemplar of the 1583 edition of the Leuven Vulgate; this Bible corrected by the commission is known as the Codex Carafianus.  Sixtus V's own editing work  At one point, Sixtus began to lose patience due to the slow progress of the commission. Nevertheless, \\"in view of the work which had already been carried out\\" the work of the commission was finished in 1588. However, Sixtus was dissatisfied with the work produced by the commission, and on 17 November 1588 told Carafa that the latter had to either give him a completed revised edition of the Vulgate or give him the Bible he was working on (the Codex Carafianus); Sixtus said it was because he wanted to revise everything himself. The same day, Carafa handed Sixtus the Bible annoted with corrections (the Codex Carafianus). According to Quentin, the corrections of the Codex Carafianus were \\"excellent\\", but they were \\"not presented in a convincing way. It is merely a list of readings without anything to indicate their value. Those readings, when put against the mainstream readings found in the Leuven Bible [Vulgate], seem[ed] to Sixtus V like some alternatives which should only be used instead of the mainstream text if they contain a real progress concerning the meaning or the literary quality of the passage.\\" Sixtus V worked by himself on the edition of the Vulgate. From 17 November 1588 until June 1589, he revised the text; until the end of November 1589, he corrected the proofs. Sixtus made the corrections using simple conjectures and working quickly. He used the Codex Carafianus.Carlo Vercellone, Variae lectiones Vulgatae Latinae Bibliorum editionis, Romae 1860, p. XXX. Sixtus was helped in his editing work by a few people he trusted, including Toledo and Rocca but excluding the members of the commission and Carafa. Sixtus V took pride in being a very competent text editor. When he was only a minor friar, he had started editing the complete work of St. Ambrose, the sixth and last volume of which was published after he became pope. This edition of the complete work of St. Ambrose produced by Sixtus is regarded as the worst ever published; it \\"replaced the readings of the manuscripts by the least justified conjectures\\". By the end of November, the text of the Vulgate was finished. Sixtus' editing work on the Vulgate was sent on 25 November 1589 to the Congregation of the Index. The aim of his work was less for the text to be satisfactory from the point of view of textual criticism, and way more to strengthen the faithfuls. The publication of the text was delayed for five months at the Congregation of the Index since most of its members, three out of five, were opposed to the publication of the text; those were Ascanio Colonna, William Allen and Girolamo Della Rovere. The members of the commission of Carafa were also opposed to the publication. = Publication = 256x256px In May (or April) 1590 the completed work was issued in one volume, in a folio edition, containing three distinct parts, with the page numbering continuous throughout the entire volume. The Sixtine Vulgate was mostly free of typographical errors. Regardless, even after the printed edition was issued, Sixtus continued to tinker with the text, revising it either by hand or by pasting strips of paper on the text.Le Bachalet, Xavier-Marie, Bellarmin et la Bible Sixto-Cl√©mentine : √âtude et documents in√©dits, Paris: Gabriel Beauchesne & Cie, 1911 (in French). The majority of this work is reproduced at the bottom of this article (\\"Annexe 1 ‚Äì Etude du R√©v√©rend P√®re Le Bachelet (1911)\\"). This edition is known as the Vulgata Sixtina, Sixtine Vulgate, or Sistine Vulgate. The full title of the Sixtine Vulgate is: Biblia sacra Vulgatae Editionis ad Concilii Tridentini praescriptum emendata et a Sixto V P. M. recognita et approbata. The edition was preceded by the bull Aeternus Ille, in which the Pope declared the authenticity of the new Bible. The bull stipulated \\"that it was to be considered as the authentic edition recommended by the Council of Trent, that it should be taken as the standard of all future reprints, and that all copies should be corrected by it.\\" The bull also stated that \\"[t]his edition was not to be reprinted for 10 years except at the Vatican, and after that any edition must be compared with the Vatican edition, so that 'not even the smallest particle should be altered, added or removed' under pain of the 'greater excommunication'.\\" Furthermore, the bull demanded that all missals and breviaries be revised to use the text of the Sixtine Vulgate, and that the Sixtine Vulgate replace all other Bibles within four months in Italy and within eight months elsewhere. This was the first time the Vulgate was recognized as the official authoritative text. Based on his study of testimonies by those who surrounded the pope during the making of the Sixtine Vulgate, and the fact that the bull Aeternus Ille is not present in the bullarium, Jesuit Xavier-Marie Le Bachalet claims the publication of this Bible does not have papal infallibility because the bull establishing this edition as the standard was never promulgated by Sixtus V. Le Bachalet says that the bull was only printed within the edition of the Bible at the order of Sixtus V so as not to delay the printing and that the published edition of the Bible was not the final one; that Sixtus was still revising the text of this edition of the Bible, and his death prevented him from completing a final edition and promulgating an official bull.  Textual characteristics  Page of the original Sixtine Vulgate, Numbers ch. 30‚Äì31. Note the unusual verse numbering. The end of 30:11 and the whole verses 30:12 & 13, which should be within the verse number 5, are missing. Two whole verses and the end of one were dropped from the Book of Numbers: the end of Numbers 30:11, and the whole verses 12 and 13 (\\"has bound herself by a vow or an oath, if her husband heard it and remained silent, and he did not contradict the promise, she shall repay what she had promised. But if he promptly contradicts it, she shall not be held liable to the promise. For her husband has contradicted it. And the Lord will be favorable to her.\\" Catholic Public Domain Version). However, it is unclear whether this was a printing error or an editorial choice, \\"as the passage was cited by moral theologians to substantiate the view that husbands may annul vows of chastity taken by their wives without their consent.\\" According to Eberhard Nestle, the Sixtine Vulgate edition had a text more nearly akin to that of Robertus Stephanus than of John Hentenius, an analysis also shared by Scrivener and Hastings; Hastings claims that the text of the Sixtine Vulgate resembled the 1540 edition of Stephanus. Kenyon also thinks the Sixtine Vulgate resembles the text of Stephanus and argues that it was \\"evidently based\\" on that text. The Sixtine Vulgate used a new system of verse enumeration, different to that of the Stephanus edition. According to Antonio Gerace, the Sixtine Vulgate \\"was even closer to the Leuven Vulgate\\". Thomson states that in many cases Sixtus V merely restored the reading of the 1583 Leuven Vulgate compared to the Codex Carafianus. He adds that the reason Sixtus V did so was because his goal was \\"to oppose heresy, not to arouse suspicions that the hitherto generally accepted text was corrupt\\". = Death of Sixtus V = On 27 August 1590 Sixtus V died. After his death, many alleged that the text of the Sixtine Vulgate was \\"too error-ridden for general use\\". On 5 September of the same year, the College of Cardinals stopped all further sales of the Sixtine Vulgate and bought and destroyed as many copies as possible by burning them; the reason invoked for this action was printing inaccuracies in Sixtus V's edition of the Vulgate. Metzger believes that the inaccuracies may have been a pretext and that the attack against this edition had been instigated by the Jesuits, \\"whom Sixtus had offended by putting one of Bellarmine's books on the 'Index', and took this method of revenging themselves.\\" Quentin suggests that this decision was due to the fact that the heretics could have used against the Catholic Church the passages of the Bible which Sixtus V had either removed or modified. Bellarmine did not take part in the ban on the Sixtine Vulgate as he was in Paris when Sixtus published the Sixtine Vulgate, and only came back in Rome in November 1590. After Sixtus V's death, Robert Bellarmine wrote a letter in 1602 to Clement VIII trying to dissuade him from resolving the question of the auxiliis divinae gratiae by himself. In his letter Bellarmine wrote concerning the Sixtine Vulgate: \\"Your Holiness also knows in what danger Sixtus V put himself and put the whole Church, by trying to correct the Bible according to his own judgment: and for me I really do not know if there has ever been greater danger.\\"Le Bachalet, Xavier-Marie, Bellarmin et la Bible Sixto- Cl√©mentine : √âtude et documents in√©dits, Paris: Gabriel Beauchesne & Cie, 1911 (in French). The majority of this work is reproduced at the bottom of this article (\\"ANNEXE 1 ‚Äì Etude du R√©v√©rend P√®re Le Bachelet (1911)\\"). \\"Votre Saintet√© sait encore dans quel danger Sixte-Quint, de sainte m√©moire, se mit lui-m√™me et mit toute l'Eglise, en voulant corriger la Bible d'apr√®s son propre jugement, et pour moi je ne sais vraiment pas s'il y eut jamais plus grand danger.\\" = Recall of the Sixtine Vulgate = In January 1592, almost immediately after his election, Clement VIII recalled all copies of the Sixtine Vulgate as one of his first acts. The reason invoked for recalling Sixtus V's edition was printing errors, although the Sixtine Vulgate was mostly free of them. According to James Hastings, Clement VIII's \\"personal hostitlity\\" toward Sixtus and his belief that the Sixtine Vulgate was not \\"a worthy representative of the Vulgate text\\" were the reasons behind the recall. Eberhard Nestle suggests that the revocation was really due to the influence of the Jesuits, whom Sixtus had offended by putting one of Bellarmine's books on the Index Librorum prohibitorum. Kenyon writes that the Sixtine Vulgate was \\"full of errors\\", but that Clement VIII was also motivated in his decision to recall the edition by the Jesuits, \\"whom Sixtus had offended.\\" Sixtus regarded the Jesuits with disfavour and suspicion. He considered making radical changes to their constitution, but his death prevented this from being carried out. Sixtus V objected to some of the Jesuits' rules and especially to the title \\"Society of Jesus\\". He was at the point of changing these when he died. Sixtus V \\"had some conflict with the Society of Jesus more generally, especially regarding the Society's concept of blind obedience to the General, which for Sixtus and other important figures of the Roman Curia jeopardized the preeminence of the role of the pope within the Church.\\" Jaroslav Pelikan, without giving any more details, says that the Sixtine Vulgate \\"proved to be so defective that it was withdrawn\\". Few copies of the Sixtine Vulgate were saved from destruction.  Some differences from the Leuven edition  The text of the Sixtine Vulgate has some differences with the text of the Leuven Vulgate. For example, in the Sixtine Vulgate, in the Book of Genesis chapters 40‚Äì50, there were 43 changes made compared to the editions of the Leuven Vulgate. Of these 43 corrections, 31 are of purely orthographic significance; and of those 31, six concern proper nouns.  In critical editions of the Bible text  The Sixtine Vulgate is cited in the Novum Testamentum Graece, or \\"Nestle-Aland\\", only when it differs from the Sixto-Clementine Vulgate, and is designated in said Nestle-Aland by the siglum vgs. It is also cited in the Oxford Vulgate New Testament, where it is designated by the siglum . It is not cited in the Stuttgart Vulgate.  Sixto-Clementine Vulgate  After Clement VIII had recalled all the copies of the Sixtine Vulgate in 1592, in November of that year he published a new official version of the Vulgate known as the Clementine Vulgate, also called the Sixto-Clementine Vulgate. Faced with about six thousand corrections on matters of detail, and a hundred that were important, and wishing to save the honour of Sixtus V, Bellarmine undertook the writing of the preface of this edition. He ascribed all the imperfections of Sixtus' Vulgate to press errors. According to Quentin, \\"a slight possibility remains that Sixtus V, who we know worked until the last day of his life to purge his Bible of the printing mistakes it contained, had let slip a few words which were heard by his familiars, one of whom was Angelo Rocca, giving the impression that he was planning a new edition.\\" Scrivener notes that to avoid the appearance of a conflict between the two popes, the Clementine Bible was published under the name of Sixtus, with a preface by Bellarmine. This preface asserted that Sixtus had intended to publish a new edition due to errors that had occurred in the printing of the first, but had been prevented from doing this by his death, and that now, in accordance with his desire, the work was completed by his successor. The full name of the Clementine Vulgate was: Biblia sacra Vulgatae Editionis, Sixti Quinti Pont. Max. iussu recognita atque edita (translation: \\"The Holy Bible of the Common/Vulgate Edition identified and published by the order of Pope Sixtus V.\\") The fact that the Clementine edition retained the name of Sixtus on its title page is the reason the Clementine Vulgate is sometimes known as the Sixto-Clementine Vulgate. Nestle notes: \\"It may be added that the first edition to contain the names of both the Popes [Sixtus V and Clement VIII] upon the title page is that of 1604. The title runs: 'Sixti V. Pont. Max. iussu recognita et Clementis VIII. auctoritate edita'.\\" Scrivener and Hastings share the same analysis. Hastings points out that \\"[t]he regular form of title in a modern Vulgate Bible ‚Äî 'Biblia Sacra Vulgatae Editionis Sixti V. Pont. Max. jussu recognita et Clementis VIII. auctoritate edita' ‚Äî cannot be traced at present earlier than 1604.\\" Up to that time, Sixtus seems to have appeared alone on the title page; after this date, Clement occasionally figures by himself.

He is a dual Olympian and an Olympic silver medalist. Club and state rowing Porzig learned to row at St Stithians College in Johannesburg, under Paul Jackson who later coached national South African crews. In 1989, Porzig's family emigrated to Perth, Australia, where he continued to row at Hale School. Porzig's senior rowing was from the Curtin University Rowing club where he was coached by Tony Lovrich who ran a successful high performance sweep men's squad. Porizg first made state selection for Western Australia in the 1991 youth eight which contested the Noel Wilkinson Trophy at the Australian Rowing Championships. In 1992 he was selected in the West Australian senior eight contesting the King's Cup at the Interstate Regatta. That eight placed second behind a stellar Victorian crew which included all four members of Australia's prominent crew of the time - the Oarsome Foursome. Porzig rowed in further West Australian King's Cup eights crew in 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996. For the last four of those years he was seated in WA King's Cup eights with his younger brother David Porzig. In 1993, Porzig applied for and won a scholarship to the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra. During his senior Australian representative years, Porzig was selected in Australian Capital Territory eights to contest the King's Cup at the Interstate Regatta. He raced in the victorious ACT King's Cup eight of 1997 and in further ACT eights in 1998 and 1999. International representative rowing At the Australian Institute of Sport in 1993 Porzig was initially paired with Robert Jahrling and they won their early 5 km time trials beating other combinations of their cohort. Nevertheless coach Reinhold Batschi changed out the combination and paired Porzig with Jaime Fernandez. Porzig made his Australian representative debut in the seven seat of the men's eight who competed at the 1993 World Rowing Championships on Racize, Croatia and placed fourth.Porzig at World Rowing In 1994 Batschi selected and coached Porzing and Fernandez in the Australian coxed four with David Weightman, Shane McLaughlin and with Brett Hayman on the rudder. They placed fifth at the World Championships in Indianapolis. That four also contested and won gold at the 1994 Commonwealth Regatta in Ontario, Canada held alongside the 1994 Commonwealth Games.1994 Commonwealth Regattahttp://www.rowingaustralia.com.au/athletes.asp?cmd=Details&ID;=23 In 1995 Porzig was back in the Australian eight where he would stay for the rest of national representative career. At the 1995 World Rowing Championships in Tampere Finland and stroked by Rob Scott they finish overall eleventh. Porzig, Fernandez, Jahrling, Hayman and Ben Dodwell remained in the Australian eight into the 1996 Olympic year and were joined in the crew by the Stewart twins and the New South Wales pair of Walker and Wearne taking over in the stern end. At the 1996 Atlanta Olympics the Australian eight rowed to a sixth place. Following a post-Olympic break Porzig stepped back into the eight for the 1998 World Rowing Championships in Cologne where they rowed to a sixth placing. In 1999 the crew raced at the World Rowing Cup III before contesting the 1999 World Rowing Championships in St Catharine's Canada where they missed the A final and finished in seventh place. His brother David had gained a seat in the Australian eight in 1997 and they raced together in that boat in 1998 and 1999. In 2000 the Australian eight qualified for the Olympics and raced at two Rowing World Cups in the lead up campaign as well as at the Henley Royal Regatta where they raced as an Australian Institute of Sport eight and won that year's Grand Challenge Cup. Porzig was in the two seat of the eight with his old AIS training mates Jahrling and Fernandez. They were joined by Christian Ryan, Alastair Gordon, Stuart Welch, Daniel Burke, the champion Mike McKay with Hayman on the rudder. At Sydney 2000 the Australian eight won their heat in a pace that blew away the eventual gold medallists Great Britain. However in the final they started slowly and their late sprint home left them 0.8 seconds behind the Brits at the line and taking the silver Olympic medal in a thrilling finish. It was the final representative appearance for Nick Porzig.

Ra≈°ilov was an actor, comedian, clown and cabaret, grandfather of actor Sa≈°a Ra≈°ilov Jr. and his brother Vaclav Ra≈°ilov, and a longtime member of the drama of the National Theatre in Prague. He came from impoverished aristocratic family. His father, who was the administrator of the noble casinos in Celetn√° Street, died suddenly in 1901, when Ra≈°ilov was ten years old. Only three of twelve siblings of children had survived. The oldest of the sons was a cellist in the orchestra of the German Theatre in Brno, and so Ra≈°ilov and her mother moved to Brno. Soon they returned to Prague and lived in Prague's suburb of Zizkov. His mother died in 1909. In 1909 Ra≈°ilov trained as a typist and from 1909 to 1914 he worked in Prague. After his return to Prague, he started performing in various Prague cabarets (Variety Karlin, Rococo, Longen≈Øv Boom Cabaret and Stage and Revolutionary Red Seven). In 1920 he was in the title role of Moli√®re play, adapted by Edward Bass and directed by George Dr√©manem, called The Lord of Pras√°tkova KHHilar.

History  =Origins and Foundation= Sculptor Vasyl Krychevsky came to Lviv to become the rector of the Lviv Academy of Arts in 1944, one of the institutions which preceded the current school which opened 2 years later in 1946. The idea of an Art Academy in Lviv began over 100 years ago. The institution is considered a legal successor of the best traditions of art education initiated in Lviv which began when the city was the capital of the province of Galicia and Lodomeria under the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the mid 19th century. It has its origin in the school of design and drawing attached to the Museum of Artistic Craft (1876), Free Academy of Art (1905), O. Novakivskyi's Art School (1923), and the Academy of Arts (which Vasyl Krychevskyi was a rector of in 1944). Prominent artists as Ivan Trush, O. Kulchytska, O. Kurylas, A. Manastyrskyi, H. Smolskyi, S. Hordynskyi, and many others studied and then taught at these art institutions. The foundation of the higher artistic educational institution in Lviv in 1946 was caused by an acute need of highly qualified specialists of fine art, applied and decorative art in Lviv. Hence at first the chairs of art textile, art ceramics, woodware, sculpture, and painting played the leading role. They were closely connected with the local traditions, folk art creation, and at the same time they traditionally kept on accumulating the achievements of European art education and art. During the next ten years, the Lviv Academy essentially extended its educational propositions, it was enriched with a lot of new forms and trends of artists training admittedly meets the European standards. A large competition among entrants that come from different regions of Ukraine as well as from many foreign countries is a convincing confirmation of its high level. Among the educational innovations introduced by the Lviv Academy, there are numerous specializations that correspond to the modern requirements of entrants. The matter concerns the exclusive trends of graphic design, artistic means of advertisement, monumental painting, art metal, interior design, furniture design, and new kinds of ceramics, art glass, art textile, and other media. =Transition to the Lviv Academy of Arts= The College of Design at the Lviv National Academy of Arts In 1994 the Lviv State Institute of Applied and Decorative Art was converted into the Lviv Academy of Arts and in 2004 it received the status of a national educational institution for its significant contribution to the development of the national education and science, state and international activity by the resolution of the Ministry of Ukraine. In the structure of the Academy there are five departments (one of them is in Sevastopol), the Kosiv Institute of Applied and Decorative Arts (Ivano- Frankivsk region), the extension courses, the access course for entrants, the scientific and research section, the postgraduate and doctoral studies, the Specialized Academic Council dealing with the defense of Ph.D. and doctoral theses (art criticism), the scientific library, the museum, the modern art gallery, the publishing section, artistic and production workshops. Such well- known Ukrainian pedagogues, artists and art critics as I. Bokshai, I. Severa, V. Manastyrskyi, R. Smolskyi, K. Zvirynskyi, M. Fediuk, M. Vendzylovych, P. Zholtovskyi, E. Mysko, E. Lysyk, Ia. Zapasko, V. Ovsiychuk played a dominant role in the Academy formation. They formed the author's school of painting, sculpture, applied and decorative arts, scenography, history, and theory of arts. The educational and creative studios (art classes) of the leading professors are a form of art education. Among them, there are studios of the Academician, the rector of the Lviv National Academy of Arts, the T. Shevchenko prize-winner Bokotey (blown glass), People's artist L. Medvid (monumental painting), the professor, Honoured artist of Ukraine Oleg Minko (art textile), the Academician, the Franko prize-winner Ya. Zapasko and Corresponding member, the T. Shevchenko prize-winner V. Ovsiychuk (art criticism), the professor, People's Artist of Ukraine I. Samotos (monumental sculpture), the professor, Honoured works of art R. Vasylyk (sacral art), the doctor of Art Criticism O. Bodnar (theory of design), Honoured Artist of Ukraine O. Bonkovsky (art metal) and others. 21 graduates of the Academy became T. Shevchenko prize-winners. Modern development of the Academy is impossible without active collaboration with home and foreign higher educational institutions. First of all, it concerns long and productive collaboration with Kyiv National Academy of Fine Arts and Architecture and the Kharkiv Academy of Design and Art. Among foreign educational institutions, there are a good few of famous European art academies and institutes in Poland, France, Hungary, Austria, Bulgaria, Russia, Baltic countries. It is especially actual in terms of European educational integration. In 1993 the Educational ‚Äì Scientific and Creative Complex was founded on the basis of the Academy. Its activity became the effective methods of realization of state programs. Twenty-two educational institutions of Ukraine of the 1st ‚Äì 4th accreditation form parts of it.

It passed through Harts Log (later Hartslog and then Alexandria) along the Juniata River. The place was first named after a hollow log at the site, which the trader John Hart used between 1744 and 1755 as a feeding trough for his pack horses. The early Scotch Irish settlers subscribed to raise the money to build a church at the settlement in 1786-87 for the Presbyterian congregation. The result was a log worship house, the Old Hartslog Church, erected upon the hill one mile north of the present site of the town of Alexandria, Pennsylvania. The surrounding church yard was used for a burial ground. The Rev. John Johnston was installed as pastor in November, 1787, and continued in that role until 1823. Memorial marking the site of the Old Hartslog Meetinghouse The first building was a primitive structure, without floor, with split log benches for the worshipers, and without heating facilities. In 1787 a floor was laid, six large windows set in, a large door constructed, and a pulpit and a communion table made. In 1794 it was laid off into four sections, and fitted with pews; which were rented. Each section was 120 square feet, from which we judge that the building was not more than 40 feet square. In 1826, the old Hartslog congregation moved to a brick building, referred to by Senator John Scott in his memoirs as the \\"Brick Church\\", which seems to have been located near to the site of the present Reformed Church. The old Log Worship House was taken down the same year, and some of its logs were used in one or two of the dwellings of Alexandria. In 1937, the Hartslog Presbyterian Church, now the Alexandria Presbyterian Church, celebrated the Sesqui- Centennial of the original log church, and dedicated a stone marker at the original site to commemorate the event. The marker remains, as do the early gravestones, now largely illegible, still marking the final resting place of those early settlers. Each year on the second Saturday in October, the early history of the community is celebrated with \\"Hartslog Day Heritage Festival\\", where thousands descend upon the small town to sample food, and buy homemade crafts and wares, from stained glass to children's toys, wood works, quilts and more.

Originally developed by Loral (now part of BAE Systems), and later dual-source procured from Loral Infrared & Imaging Systems and Honeywell Electro-Optics Div., both in Lexington, MA,Long Range Acquisition Estimates (FY 91 Base Year Projections), U.S. Government Printing Office, 1990, p. 41. it has been a product of Alliant Techsystems (ATK) since 2002.Janes: ATK AN/AAR-47(V) missile warning set 100 to 300 sets have been manufactured per annum. Operation The AN/AAR-47 passively detects missiles by their Ultraviolet signature, and uses algorithms to differentiate between incoming missiles and false alarms. Newer versions also have laser warning sensors and are capable of detecting a wider range of threats. After processing the nature of the threat, the system gives the pilot an audio and visual warning, and indicates the direction of the incoming threat. It also sends a signal to the aircraft's infrared countermeasures system, which can then for example deploy flares.globalsecurity.org AN/AAR-47 The system's algorithms include looking for temporal variations in a signal's strength, such as the brightening of an incoming missile. It also evaluates the spectral bandpass of the threat to reduce false alarms and has software for detecting events, such as the launch of a surface-to-air missile. History The AN/AAR-47 is a line of missile warning systems by Loral and ATK Alliant Techsystems. The development of the original AN/AAR-47(V)1 began in 1983 by Loral. ATK became a second production source in the mid 90s and eventually became the prime contractor. In 1998 ATK began production of the improved AN/AAR-47(V)2 version, which added laser warning functionality. As of 2005, over 5000 of these sets have been manufactured.deagel.com AN/AAR-47 In 2006, production of the AN/AAR-47A(V)2 began, also developed by ATK. It has further improved missile and laser warning capabilities.www.defenseindustrydaily.com aar47-missile-approach-warning-system-to-be-changed-retrofitted A further developed model, AAR-47B(V)2, reached initial operating capability in 2008. It adds Hostile Fire Indication (HFI), which is the ability to detect incoming rocket propelled grenades and tracer ammunition in addition to an overall improvement in missile detection. The U.S. Navy placed orders for over 1600 in 2009. Components AAR-47 Sensors mounted on a USMC V-22 Osprey aircraftThe AAR-47 missile warning system consists of 4 Optical Sensor Converters (OSC), a Computer Processor and a Control Indicator. The system is relatively light at a total weight of approximately 32 pounds. There is one optical sensor converter for each side of the aircraft. They have an infrared camera for detecting incoming missiles. The Optical modules since version AAR-47(V)2 include a laser warning sensor, and versions since AAR-47A(V)2 further incorporate an ultraviolet sensor for improved dynamic blanking laser warning detection. The computer processor evaluates the data from the OSC:s and analyzes whether a detected event is an incoming missile. If a threat is detected, it sends a signal to the control indicator which informs the crew, and the aircraft's infrared countermeasures system. Versions ;AN/AAR-47(V)1: Original version providing missile warning with IR detectors. ;AN/AAR-47(V)2: Adds laser warning sensors to the optical sensor modules and extends temperature operation range and operational life.

He's one of only two Australian oarsmen to have twice won the Grand Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta. Club and state rowing Burke was raised in Shoal Bay on the central coast of New South Wales. He was educated at St. Joseph's College, Hunters Hill where he took up rowing. He rowed in that school's First VIII in both of his senior years 1991 and 1992. His senior club rowing was done from the Sydney Rowing Club and the Sydney University Boat Club. Burke first made state selection for New South Wales in the 1996 senior men's eight to contest the King's Cup at the Interstate Regatta within the Australian Rowing Championships. He stroked that crew to a second place. He raced in four further King's Cup eights for New South Wales in 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000. His King's Cup career was during a period of Victorian dominance. International representative rowing Burke's Australian representative debut came in 1995 when he was selected to row a coxed pair with Shane McLaughlin at the 1995 World Rowing Championships in Tampere. With Teesan Koo in the bow, they placed fourth. At the 1996 World Rowing U23 Championships he competed in the Australian coxless pair and rowed to a silver medal with Alastair Gordon. In 1997 he secured a seat in the Australian men's senior eight. He raced in the eight at two World Rowing Cups in Europe that year and then at the Henley Royal Regatta as an Australian Institute of Sport crew they contested and won the 1997 Grand Challenge Cup. At the 1997 World Rowing Championships in Aiguebelette, France he rowed in the six seat for their third placing in the final and to a bronze medal.Burke at World Rowing He held his seat in the Australian eight in 1998 and raced at the 1998 World Rowing Championships in Cologne to a sixth-place finish. In the 2000 Olympic year Burke was back in contention for the Australian eight. He rowed in both World Rowing Cup races in Europe in their lead up campaign as well as at the Henley Royal Regatta where they raced as an Australian Institute of Sport eight and won that year's Grand Challenge Cup. At Sydney 2000 the Australian eight won their heat in a pace that blew away the eventual gold medallists Great Britain. However in the final they started slowly and their late sprint home left them 0.8 seconds behind the Brits at the line and taking the silver Olympic medal in a thrilling finish. Burke's record in winning two Grand Challenge Cups at the Henley Royal Regatta is a rare feat for British rowers, but never before achieved by an Australian oarsman. Yachting After the 2000 Olympic Games Burke turned his hand to Yacht racing. In 2003 he competed in the Rolex IMS maxi world championships in Capri Italy. He was a crew member aboard 'Bumblebee 5' finishing 5th. Personal and family He attended the University of Sydney where he obtained a Bachelor of Education and a Masters of Commerce in International Business and Marketing. In 2002 Burke received a Sydney University Blue for the sport of rowing. His brother Michael - a state and national amateur heavy weight boxing representative - also received a Blue in the same year for the sport of boxing. His brother in-law Matthew Gray is a three time Olympic archer for Australia. His sister Kathleen is also an Australian rower.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The church stands less than from the adjacent church of St Christopher, and shares its churchyard. History The nave dates from the 12th century, and the chancel from the 15th century. During the 19th century the church was restored, and a porch and a vestry were added. Architecture =Exterior= The church is constructed in flint rubble, and contains some freestone and puddingstone. The dressings are in clunch and re- used Roman bricks. The roofs are tiled. The plan consists of a nave and chancel, with a south porch and a north vestry. At the west end is a wooden belfry and spire, both of which are weatherboarded. The east window dates from the 19th century and has three lights containing Decorated-style tracery. In the north wall of the chancel are two two-light windows from the 15th century, and between them is a blocked doorway. There are similar windows in the south wall, and a 15th-century doorway. In the north wall of the nave are two 12th- century windows with semicircular heads, and a doorway from the same period. The doorway contains a door with 12th-century scrolled ironwork. In the south wall are three windows in different styles; a 13th-century lancet window, a 14th-century two-light window, and a small window dating from the 12th century. The south porch is weatherboarded and it leads to a 12th-century doorway with a semicircular head and jambs in stone and Roman brick. The west window has a semicircular brick head, which probably dates from the 17th century. =Interior= The octagonal font dates from the late 14th century. It is decorated with quatrefoils in circles, and with panels containing carved roses and heads. In the chancel are 15th-century piscinae and an oolite altar slab with carved crosses. Also in the church are memorials dated 1614 in memory of the children of the rector. The organ was made in 1905 by Thomas S. Jones and Son, but had been removed by 1997. There are two bells in the tower, one of which has a 15th-century inscription.

Early life Born in the Rollingergrund district of Luxembourg City on 6 June 1851, Engels studied art at the Ath√©n√©e where he was one of the last students instructed by Jean-Baptiste Fresez, considered to be Luxembourg's greatest 19th-century artist. Benefitting from a State grant, he then went on to study at the Munich Academy of Fine Arts. Career On his return to Luxembourg, Engels became an art teacher at the Ath√©n√©e, gaining the status of professor in 1895. He was popular among his students who he would often take down to the Rollingergrund to practice sketching. In 1889, he published a set of 20 drawings of scenes in Luxembourg City, encouraging his students to use them as a guide. He also stimulated their interest in art by giving lectures and publishing papers, opening up a new approach to art teaching in the Grand Duchy.Georgette Bisdorff, \\"Michel Engels\\", Collections du Mus√©e d'Histoire et d'Art, Ons stad, No 63, 2000. Retrieved 22 January 2011. Side by side with his academic career he became a highly appreciated creative artist, sketching in pencil or pen and ink, sometimes adding colour. He was less interested in painting although he has left a large picture of the Holy Family in the Rollingergrund Church. A stickler for detail, he was nicknamed \\"The Meticulous Engels\\". Specialising in religious and historical scenes, he published a number of albums including \\"Bilder aus der ehemaligen Bundesfestung\\" (Scenes of the Former Fortifications), \\"Le Luxembourg pittoresque\\" (Picturesque Luxembourg) and \\"Stadt und Festung Luxemburg ehemals und heute\\" (The City and Fortress of Luxembourg Yesterday and Today\\" as well as 31 sheets illustrating the closing procession during the city's national Octave festival. His scenes are depicted with fine lines but, in the absence of any figures, have a rather cold appearance. They do however faithfully represent the city's past, based as they are on lithographs by Jean-Baptiste Fresez or Nicolas Liez or early photographs by pioneers such as Pierre Brandebourg. In addition to his own historical drawings, he illustrated books and magazines and wrote accounts of his travels to Budapest, Munich and Vienna or to Italy and Switzerland. His account of his stays in Paris tells how he met the famous Hungarian painter Mih√°ly Munk√°csy who subsequently invited him to the Ch√¢teau de Colbach and gave him an album of his sketches. He also published several illustrated works on art and contributed articles to the German press. Finally, he also painted a few watercolours including those of the castles of Bourscheid and Clervaux.

He represented Australia ten times at World Rowing Championships between 1990 and 2002. He won world and national championships in both sculls and in sweep-oared boat classes during an eighteen year elite level career. Club and state rowing An accomplished sculler and sweep oarsman, Burgess' senior rowing was with the Franklin Rowing Club in the small southern Tasmanian town of Geeveston. Burgess began contesting national lightweight championship sculling titles at Australian Rowing Championships in 1987 representing the Franklin Rowing Club. He won his first national championship being the Australian lightweight single sculls title in 1990 .1990 Austn C'ships He rowed in the Tasmania representative men's lightweight four who contested the Penrith Cup at the Interstate Regatta on ten occasions between 1993 and 2005. He stroked that crew on seven occasions in those years and was a crew member in the seven consecutive Tasmanian wins from 1999 to 2005.1993 Austn Cships He contested the heavyweight singles sculls championship - the President's Cup - representing Tasmania in 1995. International representative rowing =World Championships= Burgess was first selected to represent Australia in his \\"home\\" world championships at Lake Barrington 1990. The Australian quad scull contained two Tasmanian locals in Burgess and Stephen Hawkins and was coached by Tim McLaren and John Driessen, also Tasmanians. Hawkins stroked the crew (with Burgess at bow) to a bronze medal.1990 World c'ships The following year at Vienna 1991 that same crew (with Gary Lynagh and Bruce Hick at two & three) won gold and a World Championship title. They rowed through the field and won by 0.23 seconds.1991 World C'ships In 1992 Stephen Hawkins was selected in the Olympic heavyweight double scull and so the champion lightweight quad was broken up. At the 1992 lightweight World Championships Lynagh and Hick had success as a double while Burgess raced the lightweight single scull championship for a fifth place.1992 L'weight C'ships For Roudnice 1993 and Indianapolis 1994 Burgess was back in the Australian lightweight quad scull and he stroked both those crews to a seventh place in 1993 and fifth place in 1994.1994 World C'ships Burgess did not make Australian representative sculling crews in 1995 or 1996 but by 1997 he was performing and selected at the elite level in lightweight sweep oared boats. For Aiguebelette 1997 he was picked in the six seat of the Australian lightweight eight who won gold, earning Burgess his second World Championship title. For Cologne 1998 and then at St Catharine's 1999 Burgess rowed in the Australian coxless four. The same four took bronze in 1998 and silver, with Burgess at stroke in 1999.Burgess at World Rowing Burgess' final World Championship appearances were in the build up to the 2004 Summer Olympics. He was again selected in the coxless four who competed at Seville 2002 (4th place) and Milan 2003 (7th place). =Olympics= Atlanta 1996 saw lightweight events introduced to the Olympic regatta for the first time. Burgess was selected with his longstanding sculling partner Gary Lynagh in the lightweight coxless four along with Haimish Karrasch and David Belcher. They made the Olympic final and placed sixth. For Sydney 2000 Burgess was again selected in the lightweight coxless four. The event showcased two match races between the Australians and the French crew. They met in a semi-final where the Australians (with Burgess in the bow seat) pipped the French by 3/100ths of a second. In the final the Australians led for much of the race. The French tried once to break through and failed, then a second time and failed and finally with a matter of metres to go broke through to win by less than half a second. Both races were superb and a highlight of the regatta.Sydney Olympics at Guerin Foster At Athens 2004 Burgess made his third and final Olympic appearance in the Australian lightweight coxless four, this time as stroke. Anthony Edwards in the two seat was also at his third Olympics and both were still looking for their first Olympic gold medal.

Depiction Brunetti is described by Leon in her first novel, Death at La Fenice as \\"a surprisingly neat man, tie carefully knotted, hair shorter than was the fashion; even his ears lay close to his head, as if reluctant to call attention to themselves. His clothing marked him as Italian. The cadence of his speech announce he was Venetian. His eyes were all policeman\\".Death at La Fenice p7 He is portrayed as honest, intelligent and diligent in his work. He is happily married to Paola, a university lecturer, and has two children, Raffaele (16) and Chiara (13). He is well- educated (with the title dottore) having read classics at university,Death at La Fenice p34 and speaks English well, from working in the USA for a period.Death in a Strange Country p54 He is by turns philosophical, intelligent and compassionate, but also pragmatic, with \\"native skills of subterfuge, trickery and deceit\\".Dead Merchant of Venice, Marilyn Stasio; 22 May 2005 New York Times; retrieved 5 July 2018 Arminta Wallace of the Irish Times has suggested that Brunetti is the antithesis of a crime-fiction stereotype; unlike the typical ‚Äúshambolic, hard-drinking, over-worked policeman‚Äù, he is ‚Äúpresentable and well-read. He gets home for dinner‚Äù and he ‚Äúseems to enjoy the company of his wife Paola and their kids‚Äù.

Even Brunetti is shocked by the number of enemies Wellauer has made on his way to the top- but how many have motive enough for murder? # Death in a Strange Country (1993) \\\\- Early one morning Brunetti is confronted with the body of a young man fished out of a fetid canal. All clues point to a mugging, but robbery seems too convenient a motive. Then something incriminating is found in the dead man's flat, which points to the existence of a high level cabal, and Brunetti becomes convinced that somebody is taking great pains to provide an easy solution to the crime # The Anonymous Venetian (1994) aka Dressed for Death \\\\- Brunetti's hopes of a family holiday are dashed when a gruesome discovery is made; a body so badly beaten to be unrecognizable. Brunetti searches Venice for someone who is able to identify the body but is met with a wall of silence. Then a call from a contact promises some tantalizing information, but before the night is out he is confronted with yet another appalling and apparently senseless death # A Venetian Reckoning (1995) aka Death and Judgment \\\\- A truck crashes on one of the treacherous mountain roads in the Italian Dolomites, spilling a terrible cargo. Meanwhile, a prominent international lawyer is found dead in the carriage of an intercity train at Santa Lucia. Can the two tragedies possibly be connected? Commissario Guido Brunetti digs deep into the secret lives of Italy's elite classes to find the answer. # Acqua Alta (1996) aka Death in High Water \\\\- As Venice braces for a winter tempest and the onslaught of acqua alta ‚Äì the rising waters from torrential rain ‚Äì Commissario Guido Brunetti finds out that an old friend has been savagely beaten at the palazzo home she owns and shares with her frequent guest and life-partner, the reigning diva Flavia Petrelli. # The Death of Faith (1997) aka Quietly in Their Sleep \\\\- Brunetti comes to the aid of a young nursing sister who is leaving her convent following the unexpected death of five patients. At first, Brunetti's inquiries reveal nothing amiss, and he wonders whether the nun is simply creating a smoke screen to justify abandoning her vocation. But perhaps, she has stumbled onto something very real and very sinister ‚Äì something that puts her life in imminent danger. # A Noble Radiance (1997) \\\\- The new owner of a farmhouse at the foot of the Italian Dolomites is summoned to the house when his workmen disturb a macabre grave. Once on the job, Brunetti uncovers a clue that reignites an infamous cold case of kidnapping and disappearance involving one of Venice's oldest, most aristocratic families. # Fatal Remedies (1999) \\\\- For Commissario Brunetti, it began with an early morning phone call. In the chill of the Venetian dawn, a sudden act of vandalism shatters the quiet of the deserted city. But Brunetti is soon shocked to find that the culprit waiting to be apprehended at the scene is someone from his own family. Meanwhile, he is under pressure from his superiors at work to solve a daring robbery with a link to a suspicious accidental death. Does it all lead back to the Mafia? And how are his family's actions connected to these crimes? # Friends in High Places (2000) \\\\- Commissario Brunetti is visited by a young bureaucrat investigating the lack of official approval for the construction of Brunetti's apartment years before. What began as a red tape headache ends in murder, when the bureaucrat is later found dead after a mysterious fall from a scaffold. # A Sea of Troubles (2001) \\\\- The murder of two clam fishermen off the island of Pellestrina, south of the Lido on the Venetian Lagoon, draws Commissario Brunetti into the island's close-knit community, bound together by a code of loyalty and a suspicion of outsiders. When Signorina Elettra volunteers to visit the island, where she has relatives, Brunetti finds himself torn between his duty to solve the murders, concerns for Elettra's safety, and his not entirely straightforward feelings for her. # Willful Behaviour (2002) \\\\- When one of his wife Paola's students comes to visit him with an interest in investigating the possibility of a pardon for a crime committed by her grandfather many years ago, Commissario Brunetti thinks little of it, beyond being intrigued and attracted by the girl's intelligence and moral seriousness. But when she is found stabbed to death, Claudia Leonardo is suddenly no longer simply Paola's student, but Brunetti's case. # Uniform Justice (2003) \\\\- Brunetti faces an unsettling case when a young cadet has been found hanged, a presumed suicide, in Venice's elite military academy. As he pursues his inquiry, he is faced with a wall of silence and finds himself caught up in the strange and stormy politics of his country's powerful elite. # Doctored Evidence (2004) \\\\- A wealthy elderly woman is murdered. Soon afterward, her Romanian maid is hit by a train while trying to leave Italy with a large amount of money and forged papers. The case appears to be solved. Then, a neighbour provides evidence that the maid was not guilty of the murder. Brunetti digs further into the case, though officially it is closed, and finds that greed was not the motive behind the killing. # Blood from a Stone (2005) (e.g., in Chapters 26 and 27)\\\\- Shortly before Christmas, a man is killed in Venice's Campo Santo Stefano. An illegal immigrant, presumably from Senegal, he is one of the vu' cumpr√† who sell fake fashion accessories while trying to stay ahead of the law. At first, the crime seems like a simple clash between rival vendors, but as Commissario Guido Brunetti probes more deeply, he begins to suspect that this murder was the work of a professional and there was more to the victim's story than met the eye. And why does his boss want him off the case? # Through a Glass, Darkly (2006) \\\\- When the body of a night watchman is found in front of a blazing furnace at De Cal's glass factory along with an annotated copy of Dante's Inferno, Brunetti must investigate. Does the book contain the clues Brunetti needs to solve the murder and uncover who is ruining the waters of Venice's lagoon? # Suffer the Little Children (2007) \\\\- One night, a group of men break into the apartment of a pediatrician and his wife, violently assaulting the doctor and terrifying his wife and baby. They claim to be carabinieri. Brunetti investigates and is drawn into a murky world of unethical medical practice, corruption, and babies for sale to those with the money. # The Girl of His Dreams (2008) \\\\- One rainy morning Commissario Brunetti and Ispettore Vianello respond to an emergency call reporting a body floating near some steps on the Grand Canal. Reaching down to pull it out, Brunetti‚Äôs wrist is caught by the silkiness of golden hair, and he sees a small foot. Together, he and Vianello lift a dead girl from the water. # About Face (2009) \\\\- At a party, Brunetti meets a charming, well-read young woman with a garish facelift. At work, Brunetti is assigned to cooperate with a carabiniere investigating the murder of a man involved in illegal trucking of hazardous waste for the Camorra. Then, the two stories converge. # A Question of Belief (2010) \\\\- Brunetti learns of a curious pattern at the courthouse: cases involving a certain judge and usher are repeatedly postponed in a way that benefits a certain lawyer. What's more, the usher is leasing an apartment from the lawyer at an extremely low rent ‚Äî until he is murdered. # Drawing Conclusions (2011) \\\\- An elderly woman dies of an apparent heart attack in her apartment. But could it be because someone shook her? If so, who and why? Brunetti explores the labyrinth of her recent activities, and arrives at a secret society for protecting battered women and a massive case of fraud committed many years before. # Beastly Things (2012) \\\\- A man whose body is found floating in a canal turns out to be a veterinarian who has been moonlighting as inspector for a slaughterhouse. Could something he learned there have led to his murder? Brunetti investigates, in one of Donna Leon's best-constructed and most atmospheric stories. # The Golden Egg (2013) \\\\- A young man, said to be deaf-mute and developmentally disabled, dies of an apparently accidental dose of sleeping pills. It isn't reported as a crime, but Brunetti and his wife Paola have known him in the neighborhood, and Brunetti can't help enlisting his police force friends to pull on the thread, until the whole gruesome past is unravelled. # By Its Cover (2014) \\\\- Someone is cutting pages out of precious rare library books, and Brunetti investigates. The obvious culprit has disappeared. Then an ex-priest who was in the library at the same time is murdered. # Falling in Love (2015) \\\\- Diva Flavia Petrelli is back, performing as Tosca. Someone has been sending her extravagant flowers and a valuable necklace. Then a singer whom Flavia complimented is pushed down some stairs, and her landlord, an ex-boyfriend, is stabbed. Can Brunetti protect Flavia from this violent stalker? # The Waters of Eternal Youth (2016) # Earthly Remains (2017) # The Temptation of Forgiveness (2018) # Unto Us a Son Is Given (2019) # Trace Elements (2020) # No Going Back (2021) Television series Trebitsch Productions has adapted the first 26 Commissario Brunetti novels for German television for ARD's Degeto Film division, although the characters and plot details in the adaptions differ from those in the source material.

The club was formed on 15 June 1935 as Sportclub S√ºdring Berlin out of the membership of Spielvereinigung Fichte Berlin,Gr√ºne, Hardy (2001). Enzyklop√§die des deutschen Ligafu√üballs 7. Vereinslexikon. Kassel: Agon-Sportverlag. . a worker's club that was banned in 1933 under the politically motivated policies of the Third Reich, which saw the dissolution of left-leaning worker's clubs like Fichte as well as clubs with religious affiliations.  History  S√ºdring spent the earliest decades of its existence in local city competition. At the end of World War II in 1945, occupying Allied authorities banned organizations throughout the country, including sports and football clubs. Later in 1945, the club was reorganized as Sportgruppe S√ºdring Berlin and they were part of the short-lived postwar Stadtliga Berlin where they earned a third-place finish in the league's Staffel B. That result was good enough for the club to remain part of first division play in the re-constituted Oberliga Berlin (I). In 1947, they were able to re-adopt their historical identity as SC S√ºdring. S√ºdring broke up into two separate clubs in 1950 with the formation of Berliner Fu√üball-Club Eintracht which was later known as Berliner Sportclub Eintracht/S√ºdring. Following the split, parent club Sportclub S√ºdring took on the name Fu√üball-Club S√ºdring. Through the 1950s, the team bounced back and forth between the Oberliga Berlin (I) and the Amateurliga Berlin (II). After taking the Amateurliga title in 1956, S√ºdring took part in national amateur championship play, defeating SV Niederlahnstein 2‚Äì1 in the opening round before going out 0‚Äì5 to eventual champions SpVgg 03 Neu-Isenburg in their semifinal match up. Following the formation of Germany's new first division Bundesliga in 1963, BFC S√ºdring became part of the Regionalliga Berlin (II) after beating SC Gatow (1‚Äì1, 2‚Äì0) in qualifying play. They remained part of the Regionalliga as a middling side until being relegated to Amateurliga (III) play in 1969 following a 13th-place result, where they would remain until slipping into lower level competition in 1975.

He served as a senior minister at the court of his brother-in-law, the Qianlong Emperor from the 1750s to his death in 1770. He is best known for leading the Qing troops in the fourth and last invasion of Burma in the Sino-Burmese War (1765‚Äì1769). Prior to his appointment as the commander-in-chief of the Burma campaign, Fuheng was chief grand councilor to the emperor, and one of the emperor's most trusted advisers. Fuheng was one of the few senior officials that fully backed the Qianlong Emperor's decision to eliminate the Dzungars in the 1750s when most at the court thought war was too risky. His nephew Mingrui was a son-in-law of the emperor, and led the Burma campaign of 1767‚Äì1768. His son Fuk'anggan was a senior general in the Qing military. Fuheng was unsuccessful in the Burma campaign. In December 1769, he signed a truce with the Burmese, which the emperor did not accept. He died of malaria, which he contracted during his three-month invasion of Burma, when he got back to Beijing.  In fiction and popular culture  * Portrayed by Joseph Lee in Take Care, Your Highness!

He was an eight-time national champion, a world champion and a three-time Olympian. He won his world championship in the men's lightweight fours, and an Olympic silver medal in that boat class in Athens 2004. He competed at two further Olympics in this discipline. For a twelve year period from 2001 ‚Äì excepting 2009 and 2010 ‚Äì Cureton held his seat in all the Australian lightweight coxless fours selected to race at the premier world regattas. Club and state rowing Cureton attended Trinity College, Perth where he took up rowing. His senior club rowing was from the Swan River Rowing Club in Perth. From 1999 to 2004; 2006 to 2008 and 2011 to 2012 Cureton was selected to represent Western Australia in the men's lightweight four contesting the Penrith Cup at the Interstate Regatta within the Australian Rowing Championships. He was in the victorious West Australian fours of 2002, 2007, 2008 and stroked that crew in 2007. Wearing Swan River Rowing Club colours he contested national lightweight titles at the Australian Rowing Championships from 1999. He competed in the lightweight coxless pair championship in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008; the lightweight four in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 ; and the lightweight men's eight in 2005 & 2008\\\\. He won national titles in 2005 in the pair and the four; in 2006 in the pair; in 2007 in the four; and in 2008 in the pair. International representative rowing Cureton was first selected to Australian representative rowing in a junior quad scull to compete at the World Junior Rowing Championships in Plovdiv, Bulgaria in 1999. They placed fourth.Cureton at World Rowing In 2000 aged just nineteen he was elevated to the Australian senior lightweight squad and into the men's eight. They competed at the lightweight-only 2000 World Rowing Championships in Zagreb and won a bronze medal. The following year Cureton was vying for places in the men's lightweight eight and the coxless four. He competed in the four at World Rowing Cup IV that year in Munich, and for the 2001 World Championships in Lucerne he raced in the Australian coxless four to a ninth placing and in the eight who finished sixth overall. In 2002 in a crew with the veteran Tasmanian lightweight Simon Burgess, Cureton raced in the coxless four at a World Rowing Cup in Munich and at the 2002 World Rowing Championships in Seville to a fourth placing. For the Athens Olympics 2004 Cureton was selected in the Australian lightweight coxless four, along with Simon Burgess and Anthony Edwards who were both making their third Olympic appearances. They qualified through to the final where Danish favourites got away in the 1st 500m. Burgess at stroke and Cureton in the three seat brought the Australian four back into contention in the second and third 500 metres. However the Danes still had something in reserve in the rush home extending their lead to 1.4 seconds at the finish. The Australians won the Olympic silver. Following his 2004 Olympic campaign Cureton was back in representative contention in 2006 and selected in the lightweight coxless four for two World Rowing Cups in Europe before the 2006 World Rowing Championships at Eton Dorney where the Australian four finished sixth. He was teamed in that crew with fellow West Australian Todd Skipworth with whom he would have a long representative partnership and success. Cureton with Edwards, Skipworth and the addition of Rod Chisholm from New South Wales, stayed together in the Australian lightweight coxless four throughout 2007 & 2008. They raced at a 2007 World Rowing Cup and then at the 2007 World Rowing Championships in Munich to a seventh placing. Their lead-up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics included a third place at the World Rowing Cup III in Poznan and a seventh place at the WRC I. In Beijing the experienced lightweight foursome didn't figure in the medals in the tough Olympic conditions, they made the B final and finished in ninth place overall. Cureton again took time off immediately after the 2008 Olympics and was back competing at the top level in 2010. He was a reserve for the Australian lightweight eight at the 2010 World Rowing Championships and competed in one event in that crew. He didn't gain a seat in either the eight or the four when they both won silver medal at those championships in Lake Karapiro. He did regain his seat in the four in 2011 and was a key part of their world championship success. They raced at the World Rowing Cup III in Lucerne to a fourth placing and then at the 2011 World Rowing Championships in Bled they staged a brilliant campaign. Second in their heat, they had to qualify for the final through a repechage and semi-final. In the final they rowed through the field from a fifth position at the 500m mark, to be 2nd at both the 1000 and 1500 and overtook the Italians in final run to take the gold medal with a 1.2 second margin. Cureton thus won his first senior world championship title, twelve years after first racing in Australian representative colours. Their world champion status qualified the lightweight foursome for the 2012 London Olympics for which they prepared by racing at two World Rowing Cups in Europe. At the 2012 Olympic regatta they placed second in the heat, third in the semi-final and made the Olympic final, finishing in fourth place. Less than one and a quarter seconds separated the 1st to 4th crews. It was Cureton's & Skipworth's last Australian representative appearance and they both retired at point. Cureton and Skipworth had won six Australian national titles together in Swan River colours; raced for Western Australia together five times for two national championship wins and represented Australia in the same boat at two Olympics and three World Championships.

Currently, the genus is considered as monotypic, consisting of a single species Pseudospongosorites suberitoides. It is found in the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and on the Atlantic coast of the United States as far north as North Carolina. This species is known by the common name Florida hermit crab sponge, so named because hermit crabs often use it as shelter.  Taxonomy  Pseudospongosorites suberitoides was originally thought to represent a species in the genus Suberites, due to its superficial resemblance and similar ecology. Suberites contains nearly all other sponges known as the 'hermit crab sponges,' most notably Suberites domuncula. However the Suberites hermit crab sponges are only found in deep water greater than 20m, while Pseudospongosorites suberitoides is usually found in shallow water near shore. In 1993 the species was named as a species in the genus Spongosorites, under the family Halichondriidae and order Halichondrida, with its similarities to Suberites attributed to convergent evolution. Genetic work in 2002 led to its current classification as the sole member of a new genus under family Suberitidae and order Hadromerida.  Description  P. suberitoides has a smooth, waxy texture and is slightly compressible. It can grow over 10 centimeters long. It is polymorphic, typically appearing as green, brown, or tan, but approximately 10% of specimens are bright orange. Dead, desiccated specimens that may wash up on a beach are often turquoise-blue. All P. suberitoides specimens contain gemmules, which are not usually produced by marine sponges.  Distribution  P. suberitoides is mostly found in the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, though a few specimens have been collected from the North Carolina coast. They may occur in greatest abundance on the shores of the Apalachee Bay, along the Gulf Coast in northwestern Florida.  Ecology  P. suberitoides colonizes gastropod shells, especially those of the genus Cantharus. These shells are typically empty (dead), but P. suberitoides has been known to colonize living gastropods as well. The sponge begins as a thin crust and continues to grow around the shell until the shell is engulfed entirely. Often these shells are inhabited by hermit crabs. A hermit crab using the gastropod shell as shelter continues to live in the shell as it is covered by the sponge. As the shell becomes engulfed, the hermit crab inside relocates to a chamber within the sponge itself. This chamber conforms to fit the spiral-shape of the hermit crab's abdomen and grows with the crab as needed, and the hermit crab shapes and maintains an opening to continue to move about and function normally. Only certain hermit crab species use sponge shelters. Pagurus impressus and Paguristes hummi are the most frequently occurring occupants. This arrangement is believed to be mutually beneficial. The sponge gains access to sand and mud bottomed habitats where other sponges could not survive. The sponge gains increased feeding opportunities and better-oxygenated water due to the feeding activities of the crustacean, and there is also a decreased chance of the sponge being buried in sediment. The hermit crab gets a home which grows in size, so the hermit crab does not need to hunt to find larger empty gastropod shells. The hermit crab may also benefit from the unpalatibility of the sponge and camouflage the sponge provides.

[Bing & Bing] built hotels and apartments at a time when luxurious in New York was still synonymous with spacious.\\" The firm hoped to take advantage of some of the amenities which would make the western part of Greenwich Village a more desirable place to live, including the coming Eighth Avenue Subway, the recent completion of the West Side Elevated Highway, and easy access to the Holland Tunnel.\\"Bing & Bing start building campaign\\" The New York Times (November 30, 1930) Leo Bing said in the firm's announcement that the goal of the project was to \\"recreate the entire district as a modern counterpart of the high-class residential section it once was\\", saying that it would \\"rival Central Park West and the fashionable east side within a few years.\\" He cited the goal of neighborhood reinvention as the reason for the simultaneous building, saying his hope was that \\"complete transformation of the section may be achieved as quickly as possible.\\" Seven months after the announcement that the land had been bought and that clearing and construction would commence, the Wall Street Crash of 1929 occurred on October 29. Architect For 2 Horatio Street, Bing & Bing chose architect Robert T. Lyons, who they had just worked with on the Gramercy Park Hotel, which had opened in 1925. The Bing brothers and Lyons also partnered on what was then a major technological breakthrough - creating the world's tallest apartment building - 17 stories - at 903 Park Avenue, which was completed in 1916.\\"903 Park Avenue, at 79th Street; 1914 Apartment House Once Called World's Tallest\\" The New York Times (May 12, 2002)Emporis listing of Robert T.

Morgan of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, seeking a way to contribute to the U.S. war effort during World War I, contracted with the Herreshoff Manufacturing Company at Bristol, Rhode Island, for a steel-hulled motorboat built to a naval patrol boat design with the understanding that the U.S. Navy would purchase her after her completion. Morgans boat, with the builders name Herreshoff No. 322, was completed in 1917. On 22 March 1918, the U.S. Navy acquired Herreshoff No. 322 from Morgan for use as a section patrol boat during World War I. She was commissioned on 2 April 1918 as USS Herreshoff No. 322 (SP-2373) with Ensign F. A. Judson, USNRF, in command. Operational history After a period of fitting out and training, Herreshoff No. 322 was assigned to the 3rd Naval District. For the rest of World War I and into the summer of 1919, she patrolled Ambrose Channel, the East River, and Long Island Sound. On 28 August 1919, Herreshoff No. 322 was withdrawn from service and laid up in the Marine Basin in New York City. The Navy loaned her to the Dock Department of New York City on 9 March 1920, but the Dock Department found her too large for economical operation and returned her to the Navy on 19 November 1920 in exchange for USS YP-3 (ex-). Disposal The Navy sold Herreshoff No. 322 to W. Lindberg of Birmingham, Alabama, on 18 July 1921.

It was the second edition of the Vulgate to be authorised by the Catholic Church, the first being the Sixtine Vulgate. The Sixto-Clementine Vulgate was used officially in the Catholic Church until 1979, when the Nova Vulgata was promulgated by Pope John Paul II. The Sixto-Clementine Vulgate is a revision of the Sixtine Vulgate; the latter had been published two years earlier under Sixtus V. Nine days after the death of Sixtus V, who had issued the Sixtine Vulgate, the College of Cardinals suspended the sale of the Sixtine Vulgate and later ordered the destruction of the copies. Thereafter, two commissions under Gregory XVI were in charge of the revision of the Sixtine Vulgate. In 1592, Clement VIII, arguing printing errors in the Sixtine Vulgate, recalled all copies of the Sixtine Vulgate still in circulation; some suspect his decision was in fact due to the influence of the Jesuits. In the same year, a revised edition of the Sixtine Vulgate was published and promulgated by Clement VIII; this edition is known as the Sixto-Clementine Vulgate, or Clementine Vulgate.  History  = Sixtine Vulgate = The Sixtine Vulgate prepared under Pope Sixtus V was published in 1590; it was \\"accompanied by a Bull [Aeternus Ille], in which [...] Sixtus V declared it was to be considered the authentic edition recommended by the Council of Trent, that it should be taken as the standard of all future reprints, and that all copies should be corrected by it\\". The College of Cardinals was dissatisfied with the Sixtine Vulgate; on 5 September 1590, nine days after Pope Sixtus V's death, they ordered the suspension of its sales, withdrew as many copies as possible, and shortly afterwards ordered the destruction of the printed copies. = Gregory XIV's two pontifical commissions = An official version of the Vulgate was still needed. Therefore, Pope Gregory XIV in 1591 created a fourth commission to revise the Sixtine Vulgate, which was subsequently reorganised as the fifth and final commission later the same year. The fourth commission was created by Gregory XIV on 7 February 1591. It was presided over by M. A. Colonna and comprised six other cardinals working on the revision. Ten other people were part of the commission as advisors, including Robert Bellarmine. These last commissions decided to make only the changes which were really necessary: to do so, the commission would consult ancient manuscripts in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. It was also decided to restore the passages unduly removed by Sixtus V, remove the additions, examine the other passages and correct them if needed, and revise the punctuation. The fourth commission worked slightly more than one month; during this time the revision of the Book of Genesis was completed and on 18 March the revision of Exodus began. However, the commission was progressing slowly, and the revision was expected to take a year. Due to this slowness, the size of the commission was reduced, its mode of operation changed, and its workplace moved to the villa of M. A. Colonna in Zagarolo. Two people were members of this commission: M. A. Colonna, its president, and William Allen. This commission also comprised eight other people as advisors: Bartholomew Miranda, Andrea Salvener, Antonius Agellius, Robert Bellarmine, Bartholomew Valverde, Lelio Landi, Petrus Morinus, and Angelo Rocca. Page of the Codex Carafianus Supposedly, the work of revision was finished in nineteen days thanks to the guidance of the Codex Carafianus‚Äîthe codex which contained the propositions made to Sixtus V by the commission presided over by Cardinal Carafa, which is a 1583 edition of the Leuven Vulgate that had been emended by the third commission under Carafa‚Äîand the experience of four members of the commission who had previously taken part in the work to produce the Sixtine edition (Landi, Valverde, Agellius, and Rocca). The work was completed either after 19 days on 23 June, or on 5 July or before, or in early October, 1591. Brooke Foss Westcott notes that \\"even if it can be shown that the work extended over six months, it is obvious that there was no time for the examination of new authorities, but only for making a rapid revision with the help of the materials already collected\\". The basis of the commission's work was the Codex Carafianus. Francis J. Thomson considers that the work of revision was rather entrusted to the Congregations for the Index under the leadership of M. A. Colonna. Thomson adds that the Congregation included among others the cardinals , Ascanio Colonna, William Allen, Frederico Borromeo as well as Robert Bellarmine and Francisco de Toledo. Thomson states that the \\"old idea that a special commission was entrusted with the work of revision [of the Sixtine Vulgate] is incorrect\\". Gregory XIV died on 15 October 1591; his direct successor, Innocent IX, died on 30 December the same year, less than two months after his election. In January 1592, Clement VIII became pope. Clement VIII resumed work on the revision to produce a final edition; he appointed Francisco de Toledo, Agostino Valier and Federico Borromeo as editors, with Robert Bellarmine, Antonius Agellius, Petrus Morinus and two others to assist them. \\"Under Clement VIII's leadership, the commission's work was continued and drastically revised, with Bellarmine (1542‚Äì1624) bringing his research on the Vulgate to the task.\\" = Clement VIII's recall of the Sixtine Vulgate = In January 1592, Clement VIII became pope and immediately recalled all copies of the Sixtine Vulgate as one of his first acts. The reason stated for the recall was printing errors, although the Sixtine Vulgate was mostly free of those. According to James Hastings, \\"[t]he real reasons for the recall of the editions must have been partly personal hostility to Sixtus, and partly a conviction that the book was not quite a worthy representative of the Vulgate text\\". Eberhard Nestle suggests that the revocation was really due to the influence of the Jesuits, whom Sixtus had offended by putting one of Bellarmine's books on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum (list of banned books). Frederic G. Kenyon writes that the Sixtine Vulgate was \\"full of errors\\" but that Clement VIII was also motivated in his decision to recall the edition by the Jesuits, \\"whom Sixtus had offended\\". Sixtus regarded the Jesuits with disfavour and suspicion. He considered making radical changes to their constitution, but his death prevented this from being carried out. Sixtus V objected to some of the Jesuits' rules and especially to the title \\"Society of Jesus\\", and was on the point of changing them when he died. Sixtus V \\"had some conflict with the Society of Jesus more generally, especially regarding the Society‚Äôs concept of blind obedience to the General, which for Sixtus and other important figures of the Roman Curia jeopardized the preeminence of the role of the pope within the Church.\\" According to Jaroslav Pelikan, the Sixtine Vulgate \\"proved to be so defective that it was withdrawn\\". = Publication = alt= Title page of the 1593 edition Title page of the 1598 edition The Clementine Vulgate was printed on 9 November 1592, in folio format, with an anonymous preface written by Cardinal Robert Bellarmine. It was issued containing the Papal bull Cum Sacrorum of 9 November 1592, which asserted that every subsequent edition must be assimilated to this one, that no word of the text may be changed and that variant readings may not be printed in the margin. Most of the misprints of this edition were removed in a second (1593) and a third (1598) edition. The 1593 and 1598 editions were in quarto. The 1592 edition contained a list of quotations, an interpretation of names, and a Biblical concordance; those were not present in the 1593 and 1598 editions. The 1593 and 1598 editions contained references in the margin, and \\"various prefaces\\"; the 1592 edition did not. This new official version of the Vulgate, known as the Clementine Vulgate, or Sixto-Clementine Vulgate, became the official Bible of the Catholic Church.  Textual characteristics  The Appendix to the Clementine Vulgate contained additional apocryphal books: Prayer of Manasseh, 3 Esdras, and 4 Esdras. Its version of the Book of Psalms was the Psalterium Gallicanum and not the versio juxta Hebraicum. The 1592 edition did not contain Jerome's prologues, but those prologues were present at the beginning of the volume of the 1593 and 1598 editions. The Clementine Vulgate contains texts of Acts 15:34, the Johannine Comma, and 1 John 5:7. The new system of verse enumeration introduced by the Sixtine Vulgate was replaced by the system of division of verses enumeration of the 1551 edition of the Bible of Robertus Stephanus. The text of the Clementine Vulgate was close to the Hentenian edition of the Bible, which is the Leuven Vulgate; this is a difference from the Sixtine edition, which had \\"a text more nearly resembling that of Robertus Stephanus than that of John Hentenius\\". The Clementine Vulgate used the verse enumeration system of Stephanus and the Leuven Vulgate. The text of the Sixtine Vulgate left an \\"eternal mark\\" in the details of the Sixto-Clementine Vulgate: in the latter's \\"spelling, especially that of the proper nouns, and in its corrections of details, even the less justified ones\\". The situation concerning the deeper modification Sixtus had made to the Leuven Vulgate text is totally different. The editors tried to make the Clementine Vulgate as similar as possible to the Sixtine Vulgate: titles and frontispieces were similar, and the page numbering of the Sixtine and Clementine editions was identical.  Title  Scrivener notes that to avoid the appearance of a conflict between the two popes, the Clementine Bible was published under the name of Sixtus, with a preface by Bellarmine. This preface asserted that Sixtus had intended to publish a new edition due to errors that had occurred in the printing of the first, but had been prevented from doing this by his death, and that now, in accordance with his desire, the work was completed by his successor. The full name of the Clementine Vulgate was Biblia sacra Vulgatae Editionis, Sixti Quinti Pont. Max. iussu recognita atque edita (translation: The Holy Bible of the Common/Vulgate Edition identified and published by the order of Pope Sixtus V). Because the Clementine edition retained the name of Sixtus on its title page, the Clementine Vulgate is sometimes known as the Sixto-Clementine Vulgate. alt= E. Nestle notes that \\"the first edition to contain the names of both the Popes [Sixtus V and Clement VIII] upon the title page is that of 1604. The title runs: 'Sixti V. Pont. Max. iussu recognita et Clementis VIII. auctoritate edita. An analysis also shared by Scrivener and Hastings. Hastings adds that \\"[t]he regular form of title in a modern Vulgate Bible‚Äî'Biblia Sacra Vulgatae Editionis Sixti V. Pont. Max. jussu recognita et Clementis VIII. auctoritate edita cannot be traced earlier than 1604. Up until that time Sixtus seems to have been alone on the title-page; after this date, \\"Clement occasionally figures by himself\\". This addition of Clement VIII on the title page in 1604 is due to the printing press of Guillaume Rouill√©.  Differences from the Sixtine Vulgate  The Clementine edition of the Vulgate differs from the Sixtine edition in about 3,000 places according to Carlo Vercellone, James Hastings, Eberhard Nestle, F. G. Kenyon, and Bruce M. Metzger; 4,900 according to Michael Hetzenauer, and Bruce M. Metzger & Bart D. Ehrman in their co- written book; and \\"roughly five thousand\\" according to Kurt and Barbara Aland. Some examples of text changes include, for example in Exodus 2, where the text of the Sixtine Vulgate \\"constituit te\\" (2:14), \\"venerant\\" (2:16), \\"et eripuit\\" (2:22), and \\"liberavit\\" (2:25) is replaced in the Clementine Vulgate respectively by \\"te constituit\\", \\"venerunt\\", \\"eripuit\\", and \\"cognovit\\".  Criticism  = Contemporary critiques = The differences between the Sixtine and Clementine editions of the Vulgate have been criticised by Protestants; Thomas James in his Bellum Papale sive Concordia discors (London, 1600) \\"upbraids the two Popes on their high pretensions and the palpable failure of at least one, possibly both of them\\". He gave a long list of about 2,000 differences between these two editions. In the preface to the first edition of the King James Version (1611), translators accused the pope of perversion of the Holy Scripture. = Scholarly critiques = James Hastings said he \\"willingly admit[s]\\" that \\"on the whole [...] the Clementine text is critically an improvement upon the Sixtine\\". According to Frederic G. Kenyon, \\"[i]t cannot be pretended that the Clementine text is satisfactory from the point of view of history or scholarship\\"; he also said the changes that differentiate the Clementine edition from the Sixtine edition \\"except where they simply remove an obvious blunder, are, for the most part, no improvement\\". Henri Quentin wrote: \\"Overall, the Clementine edition is a little better than the Sixtine, but it does not mark considerable progress\\". Kurt and Barbara Aland wrote that \\"neither the edition of 1590 nor that of 1592 [...] succeeded in representing either Jerome's original text [...] or its Greek base with any accuracy.\\" Monsignor Roger Gryson, a patristics scholar at the Catholic University of Louvain, asserts in the preface to the 4th edition of the Stuttgart Vulgate (1994) that the Clementine edition \\"frequently deviates from the manuscript tradition for literary or doctrinal reasons, and offers only a faint reflection of the original Vulgate, as read in the pandecta of the first millennium.\\" By the same token however, the great extent to which the Clementine edition preserves contaminated readings from the medieval period can itself be considered to have critical value; Frans Van Liere states: \\"for the medieval student interested in the text as it was read, for instance, in thirteenth century Paris, the Sixto-Clementine Vulgate might actually be a better representative of the scholastic biblical text than the modern critical editions of the text in its pre-Carolingian form.\\" Houghton states that \\"[t]he Clementine Vulgate is often a better guide to the text of the mediaeval Vulgate than critical editions of the earliest attainable text.\\"  Later printings  Prologue to the Gospel of John, Sixto-Clementine Vulgate, 1922 edition by HetzenauerIn the early 20th century, more people became aware of the inadequacies of the Clementine Vulgate, and in 1906 a new edition of the Clementine Vulgate edited by Michael Hetzenauer was published (Biblia sacra vulgatae editionis: ex ipsis exemplaribus vaticanis inter se atque cum indice errorum corrigendorum collatis critice); his edition was based on the 1592, 1593, and 1598 printings of the Clementine Vulgate, and includes authorised corrections. The 1946 edition by Alberto Colunga Cueto and is the current standard reference edition of the Clementine Vulgate, and a version of it is available online.  In critical editions of the Bible text  The 1592 edition of the Clementine Vulgate is cited in the Nestle-Aland, where it is designated by the siglum vgcl, and in the Oxford Vulgate New Testament (also known as the Oxford Vulgate), where it is designated by the siglum .

The trail is located in the towns of Voluntown and Griswold and is almost entirely within the Pachaug State Forest. Trail description The Nehantic Trail is a Blue-Blazed hiking trail and extends from Green Falls Pond in Voluntown to the Hopeville Pond State Park in Griswold. Most of the Nehantic Trail is on state land within the Pachaug State Forest and connects three public recreation areas maintained by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection: Hopeville Pond State Park, the Chapman Recreation Area and the Green Falls Pond Recreation Area. Each of these recreation areas provide seasonal camping, and public swimming areas are available at the Green Falls and Hopeville Ponds. Much of the Nehantic Trail is flat or has gradual ascents and descents and is suitable for casual walking or hiking, running - or snowshoeing in the winter. The steepest section is where the trail traverses Mt Misery. All trails in this area cross streams and wetland areas that are subject to flooding in periods of significant rain and snow melt. The trail overlaps with or connects to other Blue-Blazed trails in the Pachaug Forest: the Pachaug Trail in the Mt Misery section, and the Narragansett Trail at Green Falls Pond. The Nehantic-Pachaug Crossover trail is a secondary trail in the Green Falls Pond section connecting these two trails and is marked with blue and red blazes (a blue blaze with a red bar in the lower half of the blaze). The Laurel Loop is another secondary trail in this area and is marked with blue and yellow blazes. This side-trail features extensive growths of Mountain Laurel and is well worth hiking in early Summer when these shrubs are in bloom. =Trail route= Nehantic & Pachaug shared trail portion's eastern junction. The southern end of the Nehantic Trail starts in the Green Falls Pond Recreation Area, near the swimming and camping areas and the start of the Pachaug trail. The trail leads generally north, connecting with the Nehantic- Pachaug Crossover trail and then crossing Rts 138/165 to the west of the Voluntown center. The trail continues through woods and then joins Rt 49 for a section before entering the Chapman Recreation Area. The trail continues through woods and then joins with the Pachaug Trail where they pass over the top of Mt Misery (). The two trails diverge west of the Mt Misery \\"summit\\", with the Nehantic continuing north through woods before crossing Rt 201 to the Hopeville Pond State Park. The Nehantic-Pachaug Crossover runs East-West and joins the Nehantic Trail just south of where it crosses the access road to the Green Falls Pond area and connects to the Pachaug and Laurel Loop Trails at the Eastern Terminus. The Laurel Loop runs to the north from there and loops back to the section of the State Forest where access roads from Rt 49 and Rts 138/165 join together. The connecting main and side trails provide numerous opportunities for loop hikes. Since parking is available at each of the recreation areas (subject to State DEP fees in peak season), extended through- hikes are also popular on this trail. =Trail communities= The Nehantic Trail passes through land located within the following municipalities, from south to north: Voluntown, Connecticut and Griswold, Connecticut Landscape, geology, and natural environment Landscape in the area is generally low- lying and flat with some rolling hills. The most prominent ascent is Mt Misery in the Chapman / Mt Misery Recreation Area, with an ascent of 100 feet or so to an elevation of 440 feet. This is one of the higher elevations in the area so the peak offers good views of the forest to the south. The Pachaug Forest features large extents of undeveloped land, consisting of mature growths of hardwood and evergreens, along with swampy areas having extensive coverage by Mountain Laurel and other shrubs and smaller trees. History and folklore Stone fence near Nehantic Trail & Nehantic-Pachaug Crossover Trail intersection. The Blue-Blazed Nehantic Trail was created by the Connecticut Forest and Park Association as part of the Blue-Blazed Hiking Trail system. =Origin and name= The original Blue-Blazed Hiking Trails were named after Native American people and place names, in recognition that many of the trails followed historic footpaths. Trails added since often follow this convention, so many of the BBHT's have Native American names. The Niantic people or Nehantic is one of several Algonquian speaking people occupying the shoreline of Southern New England in the early colonial period of the region. The name is also used for the Nehantic State Forest as well as the borough of Niantic in East Lyme. =Historic sites= No historical sites have been identified along the route. Stone walls indicate that much of the landscape was used for settlements and farms. Stone foundations and extensive stone walls can be found in a section of the Nehantic-Pachaug Crossover. =Folklore= The town name of Voluntown is attributed to the fact that it was settled by Volunteers of the Narragansett War in 1700 who received land grants to settle there. The land was remote and difficult to farm and many of the original settlements were subsequently abandoned, so stone walls and foundations can be found throughout the forest today. The in-hospitality of the land has been cited as the origin for the names \\"Mount Misery\\" or \\"Misery Hill\\" and \\"Hell Hollow\\". Hiking the trail Rhododendron Sanctuary side trail begins off of the Nehantic Trail. The mainline trail is blazed with blue rectangles. Trail descriptions are available from a number of commercial and non-commercial sources, and a complete guidebook is published by the Connecticut Forest and Park Association. More information can be found on the CFPA website (http://ctwoodlands.org/blue-blazed-hiking-trails) including updates on trail conditions and closure or restrictions. Contact information is also available on the site for trail users to report adverse trail conditions or submit other feedback or questions. Weather along the route is typical of Connecticut. Conditions on exposed ridge tops and summits may be harsher during cold or stormy weather.NOAA Lightning is a hazard on exposed summits and ledges during thunderstorms. Snow is common in the winter and may necessitate the use of snowshoes. Ice can form on exposed ledges and summits, making hiking dangerous without special equipment. Landscape is low-lying and trails cross wetland areas. Extensive rain and snow melt will lead to wet and muddy conditions, and in this case fairly high waterproof boots are recommended. Biting insects can be bothersome during warm weather. Parasitic deer ticks (which are known to carry Lyme disease) are a potential hazard. Encounter with small wildlife is always possible and hikers should be alert to signs of erratic behavior or other disease symptoms and take evasive action if warranted. Seasonal hunting is permitted on state forest land, so wearing bright orange clothing during the hunting season (Fall through December) is advised. State regulations govern use of state forest land. The land, plants and animals should generally be left undisturbed, especially endangered and protected species.

Opened in 1875, it forms part of the Jonica railway (Taranto‚ÄìReggio Calabria), and is also a terminus of a secondary line, the Lamezia Terme‚ÄìCatanzaro Lido railway. The station is currently managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). However, the commercial area of the passenger building is managed by Centostazioni. The station's main line train services are operated by or on behalf of Trenitalia. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company. The nearby Catanzaro Lido railway station (FC), operated by the Ferrovie della Calabria (FC),:it:Ferrovie della Calabria is a terminus of a metre gauge line from Cosenza, and there is convenient interchange between the two stations. Location Catanzaro Lido railway station is situated at Piazzale Stazione, in the Lido district of Catanzaro. History The station was opened on 20 May 1875, together with the rest of the Catanzano Lido‚ÄìMonasterace section of the Jonica railway. At that time, the station was known as Marina di Catanzaro. On 15 November 1875, it became a through station, upon the inauguration of the final section of the Jonica railway, between Crotone (then known as Cotrone) and Catanzaro Lido. The station's first operator was the Societ√† per le Strade Ferrate Meridionali (, SFM). Initially, the Jonica railway was very important. Until the completion of the Southern Tyrrhenian railway in the late nineteenth century, it was the only link from the far south of mainland Italy (and Sicily) to the centre and north of the peninsula. Prior to 1890, when the Metaponto‚ÄìPotenza‚ÄìBattipaglia railway came into operation, it was the essential connection to Naples and Rome. The line's importance waned as the Southern Tyrrhenian railway diverted most of its traffic via Salerno and Naples. However, as a strategic link between the Tyrrhenian and Ionian seas, it was a target of Allied bombing during World War II. Track 1 at the station now has a plaque in memory of the railwaymen who fell in World War II, and also in memory of the bombing of the station itself. After the war, the station appeared to have a brighter future, so it was rebuilt in its present form, and the entire goods yard and locomotive shed were rearranged. In 2007, substantial restyling renewed the station's appearance, and made it more secure and comfortable. Train services The station is served by the following service(s):Calabria region train timetables *Intercity services Taranto - Sibari - Crotone - Catanzaro Lido - Roccella Jonica - Reggio Calabria *Regional services (Treno regionale) Sibari - Crotone - Cantanzaro Lido *Regional services (Treno regionale) Catanzaro Lido - Roccella Jonica - Reggio di Calabria *Regional services (Treno regionale) Catanzaro Lido - Catanzaro - Lamezia Terme Features =Passenger building= The new facade from the piazza side. Prior to its major facelift in 2007, the passenger building at the station was virtually derelict. Today, it presents as a mix between its old design (facing the station yard) and a breath of modernity (facing the street). On the station yard side, the original structure has even been preserved and restored in its original colors, and the canopy facing track 1 has been repainted. From the street side of the passenger building, a generous shelter in blue plexiglass, supported by an iron structure, protects its main entrances. Inside is a large hall, which is well lit, thanks to the numerous windows and the positioning of the benches. There are also a small kiosk, the three branches of the ticket office and the entrance to the bar. Two exits lead from the passenger building to the tracks. Between those exits are the steps down to the spacious pedestrian underpass, which is equipped with monitors giving train information, and a sound system. The underpass is useful, not only to rail passengers, but also to those walking between the city centre and Marina district side to the Fortuna area. Anyone wishing to make such a connection was previously bound to use an old and historic iron bridge. All platforms at the station are equipped with shelters, and information boards giving details of arrivals and departures. There is also a vending machine on the platform between tracks 2 and 3. =Track plan= Diagram of the Catanzaro Lido track layout Catanzaro Lido has five tracks used for passenger services, plus a sixth, on which service vehicles or passenger cars needing maintenance are often stored. The opening in 2008 of a diversion of the Lamezia Terme line between Settingiano and Catanzaro Lido (via the new Catanzaro station) eliminated a significant constraint in the station's track layout. Previously, trains arriving from or departing to Lamezia could do so only from track 1 or track 2. The diversion has radically changed the entire track layout, which is still being finalised at the Crotone end of the station yard. The main path into the station from that end now corresponds to track 1, but the completion of that end will in all likelihood divert the main path to track 3, as it is perfectly aligned with the two outgoing lines at that end. Also at the Crotone end of the station yard, there is a junction for ONMO (Officina Nazionale Mezzi d'Opera) next to the old line to Lamezia, near which can also be found RFI line maintenance equipment, operated by the Ventura di Paola enterprise. Locomotive depot and workshops A glimpse of the locomotive depot. Another facility at the Crotone end of the yard is the locomotive depot, which also functions as the Locomotive Maintenance Workshop () of the local Regional Transport Division (). This facility carries out regular checks on the whole fleet of rolling stock allocated to Catanzaro Lido, as well as ensuring that they are sheltered when they are not in service. The depot is divided into two immediately adjacent sheds. The north side shed is usually reserved solely for multiple unit trains and/or shunting locomotives (currently in service in Catanzaro Lido is one D.214:it:Locomotiva 214). The shed closer to the active line often houses locomotives. Several different units of D.345 class diesel locomotives and Aln 668 1000 Series diesel railcars are assigned to Catanzaro Lido. They are used continuously for regional services on the Jonica railway. The depot is also equipped with a turntable, wash stalls for both the interiors and exteriors of multiple unit trains, and, in the immediate vicinity of the station, wash stalls for passenger cars, with the addition of a new automated cleaning mechanism. Not far from the depot is the Dopolavoro Ferroviario, with a building used as a meeting place beside a football field. Also notable is the preserved steam engine of gruppo 625 monumentata. Passenger and train movements The station has about 180,000 passenger movements each year. Most regional trains calling at the station from Sibari/Croton terminate there. Trains operating between Reggio Calabria Centrale and Lamezia Terme Centrale are now required to reverse at Catanzaro Lido. Regional trains to and from Lamezia operate approximately hourly. The station also has direct express train connections with Roma Termini and Torino Porta Nuova. A short walk from the station is the Catanzaro Lido (FC) station, from where the Catanzaro Citt√† railway station can be reached, on the metre gauge Cosenza‚ÄìCatanzaro Lido railway. From the latter station, there are connections to Gimigliano, Decollatura and Soveria Mannelli. Interchange The station has a bus terminus for both urban and suburban buses. =Urban buses= * Line 30 Lido D circuit (Casciolino, Porto, Bivio Giovino, Via Crotone, Stazione FS, Aranceto, Bivio S.Maria, Via Conti Loritello, Rione Sala, Via Schipani, B.Ges√π, Via Crispi, Via Indipendenza, Rione De Filippis, Lucrezia Della Valle, S.Maria Centro, Corvo, Stazione FS, Via Crotone, Bivio Giovino, Porto, Casciolino) * Line 31 Lido S circuit (Porto, Bivio Giovino, Via Crotone, Stazione FS, Corvo, S.Maria, Lucrezia Della Valle, Rione De Filippis, Via Schipani, B.Ges√π, Via Buccarelli, Via Indipendenza, Piazza Matteotti, Rione Sala, S.Maria, Aranceto, Stazione FS, Via Crotone, Bivio Giovino, Porto) =Interurban buses= *Autolinee Federico Comuni of Monasterace, Locri, Guardavalle, Santa Caterina dello Ionio, Soverato, Bova Marina, Isca, Squillace, Roccelletta di Borgia. *Autolinee Ferrovie della Calabria Comuni of Soverato, Chiaravalle Centrale, Curinga, Girifalco, San Pietro a Maida, Borgia, Squillace, Cortale, Maida, Copanello, Stalett√¨, Montauro, Montepaone, Petrizzi, Gagliato, Petron√†, Sersale. *Autolinee Romano Comuni of Crotone, Isola di Capo Rizzuto, Botricello, Sellia Marina.

The system requires a relational database system such as MySQL, PostgreSQL or SQLite. Due to the abstraction of the database provided by Kajonas database-layer, nearly all relational database systems can be connected. Kajona uses UTF-8 to store its content, resulting in a system suitable for international websites. Since the system is written as a framework, external developers are able to enrich the system with new functionalities using one of the many hooks / plugin concepts Kajona provides. There are HotSpots for nearly every aspect such as for widgets, search plugins, elements or modules. Features Kajona ships with a set of modules and page-elements by default, including a comprehensive page- management (including a WYSIWYG editor for in-site-editing), navigation management, a search-module and image-elements including the support of on- the-fly image manipulations such as resizing or cropping images. Due to the extensibility, additional modules and elements may be added or removed from existing installations. A complete list of modules may be obtained from the projects website.http://www.kajona.de/features.xml_utf8_cms...en.html Besides English and German, the backend is also available in Russian, Portuguese, Swedish and Bulgarian. A review of the functions and the system was also published on the (German) content manager portal contentmanager.de.http://www.contentmanager.de/magazin/artikel_2243_kajona_systemvorstellung.html Usability The system itself is separated into two main areas: The administration backend and the portal. While the backend is used to maintain the website, the portal is used to show the contents to the websites' visitors. Compared to other CMS, Kajona is based on a page-centric approach. This means that content is placed on a page directly instead of using a complex article management linking the articles to a single page. Editing content is possible either via the backend or via the portal-editor. Portal- Editor The portal-editor is shown to users with edit-permissions when browsing the website (the portal). The editor is integrated into two separate ways: In-page-editing: Accessible via a link when hovering an editable element: The portal-editor is shown as an overlay, on top of the portal-page. The editor allows to change, edit and delete the element using the functionality of the backend while still being shown in the portal. In-site- editing: Accessible directly on the page. The user is able to click into the element (e.g. a paragraph) and start to change the content right in the final layout. Markup-toolbars appear as soon as the edit-process starts. The changes are saved on the fly, so the user may focus on changing the contents completely. Architecture Kajona is separated in several layers, providing a separation of concerns. The database-layer can be used with nearly every relational database-system. By default, the system ships with drivers for MySQL, MariaDB (mysql, mysqli), PostgreSQL, Oracle and SQLite (as on 01/13). The business-logic layer consists of a number of business objects, each representing a single entity within the system, e.g. a page or an image. The layer provides the logic to handle those objects including CRUD-operations (create, read, update, delete). The system handles the lifecycle of each object including the logic to update or insert new object and synchronizing the objects with the database-layer. Since the presentation-layer only makes use of the business objects, there is absolutely no database-knowledge required when working with the presentation. In addition, the presentation- layer contains the controller, triggering all further actions within the framework. Kajona uses a template engine in order to render the layout. The engine provides a way to separate layout from content and differentiates between page- and template-elements. This results in a flexible way to create layouts and provides a way to reuse templates. The templates are enriched with placeholders, later being filled with the contents provided by the business objects. Since all generated content is cached, the system delivers the pages out of the cache after the initial generation. Templates can be used for the frontend and the (administrative) backend. Permissions are granted using a hierarchical structure, providing the possibility to inherit the settings from a parent-node. Since Version 4, all modules and templates are distributed as packages. The code-files of different modules are no longer merged into common folders, instead a new filesystem-layout separates each package and provides a virtual filesystem in order to overwrite or redefine files shipped with the packages without having to modify the original files. Therefore, updates can be enrolled without the danger of breaking former modification. Starting with version 4.3, the framework-aspect is now way more present. Many modules are now fully decoupled. This results in independent backend- and portal-parts, making the backend usable for rapid web application development.http://www.kajona.de/en/News/newsdetails.Kajona-as-an-application- framework.newsDetail.0ea31a1526a21f07479d.html History In 2004 Kajona was built in its initial version reflecting a shared list of scripts often used by a few web developers. Those scripts were combined by introducing interfaces in order to provide easier interaction. Resulting in a first script library the idea of a framework was born and released as version 1.0. Version 2 was released in 2005, followed by the version 2.1 in 2006. Since the project was still a rather unstructured list of independent scripts, a complete rewrite was done for version 3, released in January 2007.http://www.kajona.de/newsdetails.Kajona-V3-released.newsDetail.d31d98045a039b9a232c.de.html The codebase was reorganized to be fully object-oriented, providing a strict separation of concerns and a full division of logic and layout. As of now (Jan 2011), Kajona has grown to a comprehensive, flexible and robust framework providing a large number of predefined modules and elements for a wide range of capabilities.http://www.cmsmatrix.org/matrix/cms-matrix/kajona-content- management-frameworkhttp://www.kajona.de/features.xml_utf8_cms...en.html The framework is used by public institutes such as the University of Kassel, the ETH Z√ºrich and a lot of small and middle-sized companies around Europe and all over the world as in South- Africa.http://www.kajona.de/referenzen.projects...en.html The release 3.3 was also featured on Heise Open https://web.archive.org/web/20131208034944/http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Version-3-3-of- the-Kajona-CMS-released-983923.html and other websites.http://www.developer.com/daily_news/article.php/398864/Open-Source- Content-Management-System-Kajona-Version-33-Is-Available.htm Development on Kajona stopped on 7 October 2019.

In display at the National Museum of the Union, Alba Iulia The Bronze Age is a period in the Prehistoric Romanian timeline and is sub-divided into Early Bronze Age (c. 3500‚Äì2200 BC), Middle Bronze Age (c.2200‚Äì1600/1500 BC), and Late Bronze Age (c. 1600/1500‚Äì1100 BC).Cristian »òtefan-Epoca Bronzului, page 1  Periodization  Several Bronze Age chronologies have been applied to the Romanian area. An example would be the Periodization of Paul Reinecke for the Central European space, which split the Bronze Age into four phases (A, B, C and D) based upon the associations among the found bronze objects.  Features  Co≈£ofeni culture pottery at the Aiud History Museum, AiudThe Neolithic society is characterized by a predominantly agrarian economy with stable settlements and funerary practices specific to a religion based on a fertility cult. This type of society is near the peer polity described by Colin Renfrew. One of the most important Neolithic archaeological cultures in the Romanian territory is the Cucuteni culture, one of the oldest in Europe (see Old Europe). This culture is probably the last that created painted pottery in Europe. During the Bronze Age, there were some important developments from Chalcolithic, with significant improvements in the economy. The local bronze-aged economy was based on rearing livestock (sheep, goats and pigs). The Wietenberg culture reared large cattle and horses for both transportation and food. At this time, the artistic output also significantly increased, for example the G√¢rla Mare culture who created intricate clay statuettes. In the Early Bronze Age (c. 3500‚Äì2200 BC), we see the archaeological evidence of various cultures developing, including the Baden-Co≈£ofeni culture, the CernavodƒÉ III-Belleraz culture, the Glina culture and the Verbicioara culture. Common occupations were agriculture, mining, and animal husbandry. Houses were rectangular and medium-sized. The last period of the Early Bronze Age produced a broad range of ornaments (loop rings, bracelets, necklaces, pendants comprising copper, gold, and silver and particularly bronze). Verbicioara culture was identified in 1949 by the eponymous resort excavations. Regarding burial customs, it was considered the beginning of the burial of the dead. In the Middle Bronze Age (c.2200‚Äì1600/1500 BC), the population of Romania and neighboring countries was demarcated by the appearance of several major cultures. Some that stand out include the Otomani culture (seen also in Slovakia), Wietenberg culture (seen in Transylvania), Mure≈ü culture, and G√¢rla Mare culture (from which impressive clay figurines and statuettes have been found).  Religion  Wietenberg culture artifacts. In display at the National Museum of Transylvanian History, Cluj-Napoca The Bronze Age introduced solar, or Uranian, cults. Some ornaments, considered to be solar symbols, were frequently pictured on ceramic or metal parts: concentric circles, circles accompanied by rays, and the swastika. Cremation is considered to be connected to these cults. In the Romanian territory, there are three known bronze-aged sanctuaries: SƒÉlacea, Bihor County (Ottom√°ny culture, phase II), . The only cultures of this area well represented in this regard are the G√¢rla Mare Zuto Brdo culture and the Bijelo Szeremle Brdo-Dalj culture (also present in Hungary and Croatia). About 340 pieces were found in the area of the two cultures, of which 244 are in the G√¢rla Mare area. Clay miniature axes (axes, hammers or double axes) belonging to this period have been found. Labrys double-axes are frequently found in the Cretan and Mycenaean worlds, where they occur most often in complex rituals and tombs (for example the Tomb of double ax of Knossos). In the Mycenaean context, the labrys has a wide range of sizes, from miniature forms to giant forms that measure 1.20 meters. However, the labrys site is frequently associated with the moon and can be a symbol of a goddess of vegetation, the forerunner of Demeter, who, on Mycenaean seals, is found under a tree. The goddess has an ax in her hand and receives as gifts poppies and fruits.

Most of the Bhuiya are agriculturalists and many believe that they are descended from Bh≈´mi, the Hindu goddess who represents Mother Earth. They are patrilineal exogamous groups with strong family ties. There are significant economic variations in the Bhuiya community, with some in areas such as Ghatwar and Tikait being landowners but many others being reliant on working the land either independently or as paid labourers. Basket-making, livestock rearing, fishing, hunting and the sale of forest produce such as firewood, honey and resin also contribute to their livelihood, although the practise of food collection has probably mostly died out.

Among his students at the Royal Academy of Music was Rebecca Clarke, and among Miles' associates was Lionel Tertis. thumb Early life Miles was born in Crayford, Kent, to parents George Miles (a building contractor) and Fanny Hood, of Bexleyheath, Kent. Percy's earliest compositions date from when he was 8 years-old and at the age of 13, he performed the Beethoven Violin Concerto at St. James' Hall, Piccadilly, with the Principal of the Royal Academy of Music, Alexander MacKenzie, conducting. Percy became a student at the Royal Academy of Music from June 1893. His teachers there included F W Davenport, Walter Battison Haynes (for composition) and violinist Hans Wessely., 8 April 1899 Issue, page 371. Studies and Awards In 1895 Miles suggested to Lionel Tertis (then also a violin pupil of Wessely at the RAM) the idea of switching to the viola, in order for them to form a string quartet. His name appeared several times in The Musical Times in the late 1890s connected with performances of his own compositions and for those of other contemporaries. According to a brief biography in one of these articles in 1899, he won the Hine Exhibition composition prize in 1893, the Walter MacFarren Scholarship in 1896 (awarded 8 January 1896) the first Sauret prize in 1897, plus the Charles Lucas Medal in mid summer 1898, as well as the Mendelssohn Scholarship in 1899, which was presented to him by Sir John Stainer.

Biography Federico Savelli Born into a noble family of Rome, he was the son of Bernardino Savelli, lord of Palombara, and Lucrezia degli Anguillara. After fighting in Hungary for emperor Rudolph II, he was made commander-in-chief of Bologna, Ferrara and the Romagna by Pope Paul V. Pope Gregory XV made him lieutenant general of the Papal States. After another period as commander of Ferrara, Savelli moved to Germany, at the service of emperor Ferdinand II, who named him as chamberlain. Subsequently Savelli gained the favour of the Albrecht von Wallenstein, the imperial generalissimo during the early stages of the Thirty Years' War, and obtained the command of Mecklenburg. The surrender of Demmin to Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden and his poor commanding performances caused a momentary obfuscation of Savelli's star, although Ferdinand kept his at his service and appointed him as ambassador to the Pope in 1631. On 19 January 1635 he was named imperial field-marshal. After the accession of Ferdinand III of Habsburg as emperor, Savelli was one of the commanders of imperial army alongside Johann von Werth. He was defeated and made prisoner at the Second Battle of Rheinfelden (1638), but was able to escape and was sent back as ambassador at the Papal court. During the War of Castro, he was commander of Perugia. In 1646, he defended the Habsburg stronghold of Orbetello against a French naval attack. Federico Savelli died in December 1649.

He sat in the House of Commons from 1906 to 1918. Schooling Richardson was born in East Bridgford, Nottinghamshire, the son of William Richardson. He was educated at East Bridgford National School and then at Magnus Grammar School in Newark-on-Trent. He later became a tea merchant in the firm of Arthur Richardson and Sons. Politics Richardson was elected at the 1906 general election as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Nottingham South, defeating the sitting Unionist MP Lord Henry Cavendish-Bentinck. Although described as Liberal‚ÄìLabour, he was not a trade union-sponsored MP, and as such not required to join the Labour Party in 1910. Richardson held the seat until the January 1910 election, when he was defeated by Cavendish-Bentinck. He was unsuccessful when he stood again in December 1910. He returned to Parliament of the United Kingdom seven years later, when he was elected unopposed as MP for Rotherham at a by-election in February 1917 after the Liberal MP Jack Pease was elevated to the peerage. He held that seat until the 1918 general election, when he stood unsuccessfully as a Liberal Party candidate in Nottingham West. He then contested the next three general elections in the Melton division of Leicestershire. After a clear defeat by the sitting Conservative Party MP Sir Charles Yate in 1922, he lost to Yate by only 44 votes in 1923, but by over 5,000 votes in 1924.Craig, British parliamentary election results 1918‚Äì1949, p. 413.

In the U.S. state of Maine, with a negligible African-American population but a burgeoning number of French-Canadian and Irish immigrants, the Klan revival of the 1920s was mainly a Protestant nativist movement directed against the Catholic minority. For a period in the mid-1920s, the Klan captured elements of the Maine Republican Party, even helping to elect a governor, Owen Brewster. The Klan tapped into a long history of fraught relations between Maine's Protestant 'Yankee' population (those descended from the original English colonials) and Irish- Catholic newcomers, who had begun immigrating in large numbers in the 1830s. The rise of the Know-Nothing Party in the 1850s had resulted in the burning of a Catholic church in Bath, Maine, and the tarring and feathering of a Catholic priest, Father John Bapst, in Ellsworth. Catholic complaints about Protestant- oriented public schools had helped motivate the mob that attacked Bapst. The main front in the war on immigrants before the American Civil War, however, was temperance legislation. The Maine law of 1851 was the first statewide prohibition ordinance in the country, and was perceived by Maine's Irish- Catholic population as an attack on their culture. With the growing influence of Democratic Irish-Catholic and French-Canadian municipal politicians in cities like Bangor, Lewiston, and Portland, ethnicity and religion increasingly helped to draw party lines.Anbinder, Tyler. Nativism and Slavery: The Northern Know Nothings and the politics of the 1850s (1992). Blaine Republicanism and Catholics James G. Blaine, a leader of the Maine and national Republican parties following the Civil War, and the party's candidate for U.S. president in 1884, helped deepen the rift between his party and Irish-American voters by sponsoring, while still Speaker of the House of Representatives, a proposed amendment to the United States Constitution which would have outlawed the use of tax money to pay for parochial schools. While defeated in the Senate, \\"Blaine Amendments\\" were inserted into the constitutions of all but eleven states, one of which was, ironically, Maine. The absence of a Maine Blaine Amendment would be exploited by the Klan in the 1920s, as they made the spectre of state support for Catholic schools one of their wedge issues. Blaine's 1884 presidential run is generally credited with having been defeated, in part, by Irish Catholic voters angered when a prominent Blaine supporter referred to the Democratic Party as \\"the party of rum, Romanism, and rebellion\\". Ironically, Blaine's mother was Catholic and his sister was a nun. Maine and the Klan revival of the 1920s The sudden growth of the Klan in the 1920s in Maine followed national trends, but was particularly strong in comparison to Klan activity elsewhere in the Northeast. Partly it revived much older Protestant/Irish-Catholic divisions, but it was mainly fueled by a newer wave of Catholic French-Canadian immigrants who worked mainly in Maine's textile mill cities, such as Lewiston, Saco, Biddeford, Brunswick, etc., and Italian, Polish, Lithuanians, and other mostly Catholic immigrants who went to work in paper mills in northern Maine cities like Millinocket and Rumford. Irish Catholics had also made gains in municipal politics, along with a small urban Jewish community, while rural areas had declined at the expense of a few cities such as Portland, Bangor, and Lewiston. Maine's small African-American communities in Portland and Bangor had formed NAACP chapters in 1920, and the one in Bangor had protested against the third local showing of the Klan-themed film The Birth of a Nation, successfully negotiating with a local theatre-owner to edit out the most provocative scene.Joseph Conforti, Creating Portland (University Press of New England, 2007), p. 263. The King Kleagle (chief recruiter) of the Maine Klan was the charismatic F. Eugene Farnsworth, a former barber, stage magician (or hypnotist, accounts differ), and failed motion picture studio owner.\\"Farnsworth, Former Head of Klan, Dead\\", Lewiston Evening Journal, March 15, 1926, p. 9. Farnsworth was born in the eastern Maine town of Columbia Falls, but traveled widely outside the state, and likely returned to Maine as an employee of the national Klan organization. Beginning in 1922‚Äì23 Farnsworth began a statewide speaking tour that drew huge crowds‚Äîfrom 1,000 to even 5,000 at a time‚Äîmany of whom were afterward inducted into the secret society after paying a $10 membership fee.Lewiston Evening Journal, February 17, 1923, p. 11. Farnsworth would usually share the stage with a Protestant minister, and they would rail against what they perceived as growing Catholic political power in Maine. Besides existential targets like the Pope, the Jesuits, and the Knights of Columbus, they specifically attacked the growth of Maine's Catholic school system, as well as the presence of Catholics (and Jews) on public school boards. They credited this last development with \\"taking the Bible out of schools\\", as the Catholic population increasingly objected to the reading of the King James Bible in state-supported classrooms.\\"Lewiston Rector Addresses Ku Klux Klan\\", Lewiston Evening Journal, March 24, p. 1; Lewiston Daily Sun, March 17, 1923, p. 1; \\"Maine City Hears KKK Leader\\", Christian Science Monitor, April 28, 1923. The Klan and the Portland referendum of 1923 The Maine Klan scored its first political victory in 1923 when it threw its support behind a Portland referendum to abolish the mayor-and-alderman form of municipal government, which allowed Irish-Catholic and Jewish neighborhoods some influence in city politics, and substituted a city manager and councilors elected at large, which diluted the power of minorities. Portland's NAACP tried to create a united front among Irish, Jewish, African- Americans, and labor unions in opposition to the change, but it was unsuccessful.\\"Maine Voices: Why Portland Doesn't Have an Elected Mayor\\", Portland Press Herald, September 27, 2010. Although the measure had lost by only 200 votes in a previous try (before the Klan was formed) the overwhelming margin of victory after the Klan became involved (it won by 4,000 votes) convinced local and national politicians alike that the Maine Klan was a force to be reckoned with.Lewistion Daily Sun, September 11, 1923. Maine may also have been targeted by the national Klan organization precisely because it was considered a bellwether state in national elections (\\"as Maine goes, so goes the nation\\" was the phrase at the time). Even before the victory in Portland, Farnsworth had declared that the Klan would elect the next governor of Maine.Lewiston Daily Sun, April 1923, p. 6. The Klan on parade, and cross burnings Although a secret society, the Klan maintained a very public image in Maine from the time recruitment started in earnest in 1923. Farnsworth's speeches were made in large open halls and sometimes reprinted in full in local papers. In September, 1923, the Mayor of Portland refused a Klan request for a public parade on Columbus Day, but daylight parades by hooded Klansman did take place in Portland, Sanford, Gardiner, Brewer, Milo, Dexter, East Hodgdon, and Kittery.\\"Klan Parade in Kittery\\" Portsmouth (NH) Herald, August 17, 1925, p. 10 400 participated, ending their parade at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and Brownville Junction among other places.Lewiston Daily Sun, September 10, 1923, p. 8; Maine Memory Network, \\"Ku Klux Klan Parade in Brownville Junction\\", 1924 In the Piscataquis County town of Milo, Farnsworth claimed \\"everybody\\" belonged to the Klan: 600 citizens, town officials, and the sheriff.Lewiston Evening Journal, September 28, 1923. The Klan parade in Milo in 1923 was the first in New England, and the first in the U.S. to take place in broad daylight.Richard K. Shaw, Brewer, Maine (Arcadia Publishing, 2000), p. 125 The first State Convention of the Klan was held in the forest outside Waterville later in 1923, and attracted 15,000. Burning crosses were in abundance.Lewiston Daily Sun, August 27, 1923. That same year the Klan purchased a large estate in Portland (the Rollins Estate on Forest Avenue) for its headquarters, and 3,000 Klansmen from around the state gathered for the opening ceremony in February, 1924, initiating 200 new members under a burning cross.Providence News, August 23, 1923, p. 36; \\"New Klan Home at Portland Dedicated\\", Lewiston Evening Journal, February 16, 1924. The Portland 'klavern' (chapter) was named after Dr. W. H. Witham, the Grand Klud (religious leader) of the Realm of Maine.Boston Daily Globe, September 8, 1923. The Klan also claimed to have opened a 'tabernacle' in Bangor.Lewiston Daily Sun, April 19, 1923, pp. 1 & 6. In some cities and towns, groups of Catholics (mostly French-Canadians) opposed Klan marches forcefully. In 1924, French-Canadians turned back a Klan march in Greenville, fought the Klan with rocks and clubs in Fairfield (before tearing down a burning cross), and defended a bridge in Biddeford.C. Stewart Doty, \\"The KKK in Maine was not OK\\", Bangor Daily News, June 10, 1994, p. A14. Klan ministers Many of Maine's Protestant ministers spoke at Klan rallies and at least one, Methodist pastor Arthur F. Leigh of Randolph, Maine, openly declared himself a Klansman. While testifying at a public hearing of the Maine Senate in 1925 on the Barwise Bill, a measure which the Klan supported, Leigh shouted \\"I am a Klansman, get it!?\\" at which the public gallery, also packed with Klansmen, erupted.\\"Avowed Klansman Creates Sensation at Hearing on Barwise Bill in Augusta\\", Lewiston Daily Sun, February 20, 1925. Other ministers associated with the Maine Klan included the Rev. George S. Robinson of Trinity Episcopal Church in Lewiston, Maine,\\"Lewiston Rector Addresses KKK\\", Lewiston Evening Journal, March 24, 1923, p. 1. the Rev. Nathaniel French of Auburn, Maine,\\"Names of Local Klan Agents Disclosed in Meeting in Auburn\\", Lewiston Daily Sun, April 19, 1923, pp. 1 & 6. the Rev. E.V. Allen, who was described as \\"The Grand Klaliff (Vice Dragon) of Maine\\",Lewiston Daily Sun, November 7, 1925, p. 11. and the Rev. Judson P. Marvin of Portland.Lewiston Daily Sun, March 17, 1923, p. 1; (Marvin's obituary in the Portsmouth (NH) Herald, March 20, 1933, p. 7, states that he \\"held one of the high offices within that organization\\" (i.e. the Klan). Marvin was from Portsmouth, and the son of a former mayor.) In 1926 the Rev. Milton Charles Bennett of Bangor sued Klansmen F. Herbert Hathorn of Brewer and D.D. Terrill of Bangor because he was discharged as pastor of the \\"Klan Church\\" of Bangor and Brewer. Bennett was awarded compensation.Lewiston Evening Journal, September 28, 1923, p. 1; Biddeford Weekly Journal, February 12, 1926, p. 7. Klan ministers were most often Methodists, and sometimes Baptists, while the Congregational and Unitarian churches openly opposed the organization.William R. Pattangall quoted in New York Times, September 3, 1924, p. 1. The Klan and the Maine Republican Party The arrival of the Klan on the local political scene split the Maine Republican Party. An old- guard element loyal to Gov. Percival Baxter and U.S. Senator Frederick Hale staunchly opposed the Klan. As early as 1922, Baxter had called it \\"an insult and an affront to American citizens\\" and said \\"I believe Maine people prefer the light of day to deeds of darkness\\".\\"Warns Klan in Maine\\", New York Times, November 2, 1922, p. 10. The Klan found champions, however, in state senators Mark Alton Barwise and Owen Brewster, who sponsored legislation seeking to outlaw state aid to parochial schools. Brewster refused to denounce Klan support in his own run for the governorship in 1924. The Democrats picked, as their candidate to oppose Brewster, William Robinson Pattangall, a descendant of Mayflower Yankees, who had attempted (unsuccessfully) to insert an anti- Klan plank into the platform of the Democratic National Convention that same year. Pattangall campaigned almost entirely on anti-Klan sentiment, while Brewster said nothing about the society. Brewster won by a large margin, seeming to fulfill Kleagle Farnsworth's promise that the Klan would select the next governor. The following year the Maine Klan elevated DeForest H. Perkins, the former Portland School Superintendent, as the state's own Grand Dragon. King Kleagle Farnsworth, who by this time had broken with the Klan over its refusal to accept Canadian immigrants (who were prominent in the Maine ranks), died suddenly of an illness in 1926. He was replaced as King Kleagle of Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont by Dr. Edward W. Gayer, an Indiana-born physician and graduate of Purdue University.Obit, Lewiston Daily Sun, August 17, 1934, p. 1. On the county, municipal, and town levels, Klansmen captured several offices and influenced many other elections. Avowed Klansmen became mayors of Saco (John G. Smith), Westbrook (Charles S. Tuttle Jr) and Rockland.Boston Daily Globe, December 11, 1923, p. 17. The Klan \\"figured prominently\\" in the election of mayor Allen M. Irish of Bath.Lewiston Daily Sun, March 19, 1924, p. 12. In 1923, the Klan were beginning \\"to take an active part in the politics\\" of Brewer,Lewiston Evening Journal, September 10, 1923 p. 3. and the following year Kleagle Farnsworth declared that \\"all Klan candidates\\" on the ballot had won in the town of Dexter, Maine (Gov. Brewster's home town). In 1928 the New York Times referred to Newport and Kennebunkport as \\"old Ku Klux capitals\\"New York Times, September 12, 1928. p. 18. Other political figures whose elections were reportedly endorsed by the Klan included Androscoggin County sheriff E.E. , Auburn mayor Fred E. Walton,Lewiston Daily Sun, November 26, 1925, p. 2. Lisbon Falls state representative Louis A. Jack, and president of the Maine State Senate Hodgdon Buzzell. The 1926 special senatorial election A 1926 special election for U.S. Senator from Maine following the death of Sen. Bert M. Fernald saw the Klan issue played out again. This time the Republican candidate, Arthur R. Gould, ran on an explicitly anti-Klan platform, winning with the help of large numbers of Democrats who crossed over to send a message to the Klan faction of Republicans.Lewiston Daily Sun, June 16, 1928. Governor Brewster took the unprecedented step of denouncing the senatorial candidate of his own party, which only helped Gould's cause. For the first time in a Maine senatorial election, Gould won every county and city in the state.\\"Klan Animus Aided Victor\\", New York Times, November 30, 1926, p. 1. The Chairman of the Republican State Committee declared that with Gould's victory, \\"the sinister influence of an oath-bound organization no longer threatens the welfare of Maine\\".Lewiston Daily Sun, November 29, 1926, p. 13. Other Maine Republicans who took uncompromising stances against Klan influence in their party during the 1920s included state representatives Clyde Smith (husband of future Senator Margaret Chase Smith); Robert Hale (cousin of U.S. Sen. Frederick Hale and a future U.S. Congressman); and former Penobscot County sheriff Maj. Arthur L. Thayer, who mounted a primary challenge against Brewster in 1926. Decline of the Maine Klan Even before the Gould election revealed the limits of Klan influence, the organization began to weaken in other ways. In May 1926, Mayor Ernest L. McLean of Augusta (a Democrat) caused the cancellation of a large Klan rally and parade in the state capital by prohibiting marchers from wearing hoods or otherwise covering their faces.Lewiston Evening Journal, May 26, 1926, p. 6. The national Klan itself would prohibit the wearing of face-covering hoods by its members in 1928, a measure which accelerated the decline in membership. Also in February 1926 the sprawling headquarters of the Maine Klan in Portland was seized by the city for unpaid taxes, with the organization's affairs being described by one newspaper as \\"muddled\\".Biddeford Weekly Journal, February 5, 1926, p. 4. By 1928 the New York Times reported that Klan strength in Portland had fallen from 900 to 200‚Äì300. This mirrored the decline of the Klan nationally.New York Times, February 5, 1928. p. 31. An area Farnsworth tried but ultimately failed to develop was the recruitment of women. His desire was for a branch of the Klan to stem the growth of Catholics in public education and strengthen moralistic teachings in the home. For him women were the answer. Mrs. Gertrude Witham was promoted to Major Kleagle of the Maine Women of the KKK. However Farnsworth and Witham failed in effectively recruiting new women members. It also became apparent as timed passed that some of the female Klan members were foreign-born (i.e. Canadian). This resulted in the dismissal of these women and their suing of the Klan to recover their initiation fees and dues. On top of this Farnsworth continued to charge $10 as an initiation fee, instead of the agreed-upon fee by the national women's organization of $5. These efforts outside of the guidelines of the national Klan, along with other perceived misconduct, would eventually lead to Farnsworth's resignation as King Kleagle of Maine. A 1928 Republican senatorial primary fight was the last time the Klan campaigned openly for a candidate, in this case for Owen Brewster against incumbent Frederick Hale. Ex-governor Baxter, also a Republican, openly accused Brewster of Klan membership, claiming he had joined the organization and sworn an oath in front of the Imperial Wizard in Washington, D.C.New York Times, July 14, 1928, p. 10. Baxter further testified that Brewster had offered him 25,000 Klan votes, which \\"he absolutely controlled\\" if he (Baxter) would enter the gubernatorial campaign that same year. Baxter made these and other charges in a long newspaper interview, in which he also accused Brewster of \\"political treachery and double-dealing\\" and being \\"unworthy of the confidence of the Republican Party\\".\\"Says Brewster Is Klansman\\". Biddeford Weekly Journal, June 15, 1928, p. 1. In the Republican primary for governor that same year, the mayor of Saco, Maine, avowed Klansman John C. Smith, lost to old-guard Republican William Tudor Gardiner.Biddeford Weekly Journal, December 2, 1928, p. 4. The victories of Hale and Gardiner, this time without the help of Democrats, proved that the Maine Klan was a spent political force, and led to the resignation of Grand Dragon Perkins.Lewiston Daily Sun, June 29, 1928, p. 16. Brewster was eventually elected to the House of Representatives, and then the Senate, where he became a close ally of Wisconsin's Joseph McCarthy, a Roman Catholic (they were united largely by anti-communism). In 1928 the Catholic Diocese of Maine struck a triumphalist note by naming its newly opened high school in Bangor after father John Bapst, the priest who had been tarred and feathered in Ellsworth during a previous period of anti-Catholicism. Klan Klaverns (local chapters) lingered on in some Maine towns years after the national and state organizations had dissolved, partly kept alive by their women's auxiliaries. In Kittery, the \\"ladies of the Klan\\" held a baked bean and salad supper at the local Grange Hall in 1931, and Kittery's Klavern (no. 5) sponsored a booth at a Depression-era \\"Unemployment Bazaar\\" in 1933, alongside the Lion's Club, garden clubs, and even the local Catholic Church. At this last event, the names of all six booth-tenders were published in the newspaper, suggesting that the \\"Invisible Empire\\" was trying to adapt to the role of local fraternal organization.Portsmouth (NH) Herald, June 2, 1931, p. 7; Portsmouth Herald, January 30, 1933, p. 7. By the mid-1930s, however, references to the KKK in the Maine press had all but disappeared. 1987 Rumford rally As part of a recruitment campaign, on September 26, 1987, about two dozen Klan members burned a cross on a farm about 15 miles from Rumford, Maine. A Klan spokesman, James W. Farrands, said that Rumford was chosen just for its central location. Anti-klan rallies were held in Portland, Bangor, Augusta, Lewiston, and Kennebunkport, and there were 150‚Äì200 anti-Klan demonstrators in Rumford, including representatives of the governor and Maine's two senators. To show their displeasure, neighbors surrounded the farm with chicken manure.

The campaign is administered by Li Guoqiao, one of the researchers who developed a Chinese herb used as treatment for malaria into artemisinin, probably the most effective antimalarial drug. The campaign is centered at the Tropical Medicine Institute, and the program relies on Artemisia annua of hybrid ancestry, which was used for a drug regimen by which all residents of the island, whether or not visibly ill, took two doses at a 40-day interval. This eliminated the human reservoir of the disease and reduced hospital admissions to 1% or less of January 2008 levels. Visitors to Moheli are now required to take antimalarial drugs, a mix of artemisinin, primaquine and pyrimethamine that China provides for free. When asked about Artemisia exports, Li was quoted as saying, \\"We want to grow them in China and whatever we export depends on bilateral relationships.\\" Comoros has requested a similar program for Grande Comore and Anjouan, total population 760,000, and Li said that Beijing has agreed in principle.Africa: Ending Malaria in Sight?

Its name is a reference to the crimson clover, a species of clover native to Europe. Originally released for Windows on January 11, 2011 in Japan, a NESiCAxLive arcade version was released on April 25, 2013. An updated Windows version, entitled Crimzon Clover: World Ignition was released worldwide on June 6, 2014 via Steam, on December 3, 2014 via GOG.com. Gameplay The player controls one of three types of ship - Type I, II or Z. All ships share the same control scheme, though movement speed, option arrangement, and break gauge refill differ between the three. ;Controls * Arrow keys move the craft. * Button 1 (default Z) releases rapid fire straight ahead from both the craft and its options. * Button 2 (default X), when held, creates a circular field around the player, denoted by a green border. When enemies move inside the border, the craft locks on to them (denoted by a blue line connecting the craft and enemies). ** One enemy can be locked onto multiple times, but the number of times they can be locked on to depends on the amount of health remaining. For example, enemies with only 1 hit point can only be locked onto once. ** When the ship reaches the maximum number of allotted lock-ons (16 to start, but more after being powered up/entering Break or Double Break mode), a chime plays and the blue lines connecting the craft to its targets turns red. ** Releasing Button 2 when any number of lock-ons are active deploys a number of homing lasers equal to the number of active lock-ons. ** Releasing a large number of lasers in one lock-on grants the player a score multiplier for a short amount of time - during the multiplier, the value of every enemy kill and item acquisition is multiplied by the current multiplier (similar to ESP Ra.De.s secondary shot multiplier). The maximum possible multiplier is √ó6.4, which is accessible only through use of Double Break Mode. * The function of Button 3 (default C) varies depending on the current status of the Break Gauge. ;The Break Gauge In Original and Unlimited modes, using a bomb when the 'Break Mode' gauge is full activates Break Mode. This gives a small window of invincibility, increases firepower, and doubles the speed at which the \\"Break Rate\\" counter rises and falls. You can also stack one full Break Mode gauge on top of another - which activates Double-Break Mode, featuring the most intense amount of firepower and score capability. Attacking multiple enemies in a short time increases the \\"Break Rate\\" counter, which multiplies the score given for collecting the golden stars dropped by defeated enemies. ;Difficulty levels The game has 3 difficulty levels - Simple, Original, and Unlimited. * Simple mode lacks the ability to enter Break Mode, but the Break Gauge has a special utility in this mode - as it passes 50% and 100%, the speed of bullets increases. In this way, gauge level acts similar to rank in Battle Garegga. When the Break Gauge is full, shooting enemies at point-blank range will create a shower of point items, and the score will increase automatically, similar to the Maximum bonus in the DoDonPachi series. * Original mode allows (Double) Break Mode, and features a \\"Break Rate\\" in addition to the lock-on multiplier. Break Rate increases by shooting enemies or locking on to large groups. When in Break Mode, the Break Rate temporarily doubles, and when Double Break Mode is accessed the Rate temporarily doubles yet again. Deaths and bombs deplete the Break Gauge. * Unlimited mode has the same play system as Original mode, but features higher bullet count. Players also have the ability to clear all bullets on the screen by hitting and killing at least one enemy with a full lock-on. ;Plot Little plot information is given, however pieces of plot information are revealed in the World Ignition edition via Steam. The player takes the role of a pilot of mysterious identity sent on a mission to assault a military base of a hostile army, and destroy a mechanical entity known as Gorgoneion which is in the process of constructing a doomsday weapon known as the Crimson Heart. Development and release Yotsubane, the developer of Crimzon Clover, released two trial versions over the development period, and one paid trial at Comiket 78. The game was originally scheduled to come out during Comiket 78, but schoolwork forced Yotsubane to push back the release date. * Version 0.10 has only one stage and relatively crude graphical and audio quality. * Version 0.20 has three stages (though the Stage 3 boss is unfinished), as well as a second difficulty level, Unlimited. Only one stage of Unlimited is available. * Version 0.30, released during Comiket 78, adds the \\"Double Break\\" mechanic (see below) and includes 3 completed stages on Original mode, as well as 2 stages on Unlimited and two stages on a new difficulty, Simple. It also adds more items to the game shop, including the ability to skip various scenes and restart the game more quickly, and a second ship type. * Version 1.00, released during Comiket 79 and available through Toranoana online shopping and various independent retailers, contains 5 stages and two sequential true last bosses for all 3 difficulties. It also adds level practice and unlockable music pieces that can be accessed through the \\"Sound Test\\" option in the main menu. * Version 1.01 adds replay support and western- style score display (referred to as \\"World\\") while fixing various bugs, including a scrolling bug that allowed for the duplication of the fifth boss and spawning of the second boss during the final boss fight. A screenshot on Yotsubane's blog also shows a version labeled 0.40 however differences between this and 0.30 are unknown. Reception Hardcore Gamer praised Crimzon Clover: World Ignition, giving it a 4 out of 5 and stating: \\"we didn‚Äôt have much to say about Crimzon Clover: World Ignition that was negative. That was by design, though, as we can‚Äôt fault a game for flaws it doesn‚Äôt possess. If anything, the only flaws it may have are the ones intrinsic to the genre, not the game.\\" Destructoid described the game as being similar to CAVE shooters.

Hayleys accounts for 2.73% of Sri Lanka's export income. The Company operates through seven broad segments: Global Markets and Manufacturing, Agriculture, Power and Energy, domestic and industrial lighting, Transportation and Logistics, Leisure and Aviation, Consumer, and Investments and Services. Hayleys comprises over 130 business units and subsidiaries, 9 of which are publicly listed in the Colombo Stock Exchange. The company has 36,000 employees.  History  The beginnings of the Hayleys Group can be traced back to 1878 when Charles P Hayley disembarked from the Percy Douglas, a 781-tonne clipper ship on to the shores of Galle, Sri Lanka. Chas Hayley founded the forerunner of Hayleys, Chas P. Hayley, in 1878.., to trade in coconut fibres. In 1909, he entered into partnership with W. W. Kenny to purchase Thurburn Stores, at Deans Road. Hayley and Kenny and Chas P. Hayley were made Private Limited Companies in 1935 and 1943, respectively. In 1954 under one corporate umbrella, the entity went public. Hayleys Ltd continued to diversify into a portfolio that currently includes activated carbon, rubber gloves, textiles, fibre based products, tea and rubber plantations, transportation and logistics services, consumer products, and other investments and services to name just a few. Hayleys and its associates have forged successful partnerships with global giants such as Mercedes-Benz, TATA International, Dystar, Symrise, Bayer Cropscience, Philips Lighting, Polymer Latex, Volvo, Fujifilm, P&G;, Shimadzu, Fedex and Gillette, to name just a few. Its adherence to the tenets of good corporate governance and ethical practices has made it one of the most respected companies in Sri Lanka and a corporate inspiration to many others. Despite such unfavorable conditions such as an ethnic conflict that had claimed 65,000 lives since 1983, rampant inflation, and devastation and 30,000 deaths caused by the tsunami of 2004, Hayleys has survived and evolved into a US$300 million firm. The company has now transformed from its roots as a trading company into an industrial and services conglomerate. In addition to Sri Lanka, Hayleys today has manufacturing facilities in Indonesia and Thailand and marketing operations in Australia, India, Bangladesh, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, UK and USA and its products are sold in 80 countries.

Dressed in a hockey uniform and cape, and accompanied by a performing monkey named Squeeks, he fights crime to avenge his parents' deaths. He is described by Joe Brancetelli in The World Encyclopedia of Comics as \\"a hero, yes, but first a boy... arguably the best- handled boy's adventure feature ever to appear in comics.\\"Brancatelli, Joe, \\"Biro, Charles (1911-1972)\\" in Maurice Horn (ed.), The World Encyclopedia of Comics (Chelsea House Publishers, 2nd ed., 1999) , pp. 134-135 Some sources credit the character solely to Charles Biro; others co-credit Bob Wood, co- credited on the first cover of the new Boy Comics title. Publication history Crimebuster was introduced in Boy Comics #3 (April 1942, the first issue of the periodical following a revamp, after two issues as Captain Battle). In that issue the character's father, a heroic war correspondent, is killed by a Nazi criminal called Iron Jaw (due to his metallic prosthetic lower face). Iron Jaw has also abducted Chuck's mother, so the boy travels to France to rescue her, but during their escape she is killed by Germans. Chuck adds his military school's cape to the contemporary hockey uniform he is wearing at the time this adventure begins (which conveniently features the school's initial \\"C\\" on the chest), and takes on the name \\"Crimebuster\\". He pursues Iron Jaw until issue #15, in which the character is killed, but continues his crusade. (Iron Jaw returns later in the series.) Chuck also tangles with a hermaphroditic serial killer named the He-She in issue #12. Although his initial adventures focused on his \\"crimebusting\\" agenda, as the superhero genre became less popular, stories focused more on the character's school life. With the war over, the school changed from Custer Military Academy to Curtis High School. He stopped wearing the costume, explained in- story by a girl suggesting that it looked silly. He dropped the \\"Crimebuster\\" name altogether after issue #111 (May 1955) (his friends continued to call him \\"C.B.\\") when the Comics Code Authority ‚Äì with its restrictions on the use of the word \\"crime\\" ‚Äì was established. He continued as \\"Chuck Chandler\\" until Boy Comics ceased publication, with issue #119 (March 1956). The character was revived briefly in 1990 by AC Comics, a publisher focusing on Golden Age superheroes, in their series Femforce.  In popular culture  The cover of Rage Against the Machine's album Evil Empire features a painting by Mel Ramos of a boy costumed as Crimebuster, with the letter on his chest change to a lowercase \\"e\\".

Origins He was a younger son of William Cope (c.1440‚Äì1513), Esquire, Cofferer of the Household to King Henry VII, by his second wife Jane (or Joan) Spencer. According to most sources, William Cope had two wives: *Agnes Harcourt, identified variously as the widow of Thomas Stonor, and daughter and heir of Sir Robert Harcourt, and as one of the five daughters and coheirs of Sir Robert Harcourt, standard- bearer of Henry VII at Bosworth, and mother of William Cope's eldest son and heir, Stephen Cope, esquire, who was Serjeant of the Poultry to Henry VIII, and married Anne Saunders, daughter and coheir of William Saunders of Oxfordshire, 'from whom the family at Bedhampton in Hampshire descended, that extinguished in daughters'. *He married secondly, by 1496, Jane Spencer (d. 12 February 1526), sister of Thomas Spencer of Hodnell, Warwickshire, and daughter of John Spencer (died c.1496) of Hodnell by Anne Empson, sister of Sir Richard Empson. She was heir to her mother, Anne Empson. In 1506 William Cope sold his manors of Wormleighton and Fenny Compton to his wife's cousin, Sir John Spencer (d.1522), son of William Spencer of Snitterfield.'Parishes: Wormleighton', A History of the County of Warwick: Volume 5: Kington hundred (1949), pp. 218-224 Retrieved 1 December 2013.'Parishes: Fenny Compton', A History of the County of Warwick: Volume 5: Kington hundred (1949), pp. 47-50 Retrieved 1 December 2013. At the time of her marriage to William Cope, Jane Spencer was the widow of William Saunders (died c.1493), by whom she had four daughters, Anne, Isabel, Joyce and Alice.Summary of will of William Saunders of Banbury Retrieved 1 December 2103. Alice Saunders married John Cooke, esquire, of Gidea Hall, and was the mother of Sir Anthony Cooke (d. 11 June 1576) and Beatrix Cooke, who married Richard Ogle, esquire. In her will dated 20 January 1526 Jane (n√©e Spencer) left bequests to Sir Anthony Cooke and his sister Beatrix. By his second wife, Jane Spencer, William Cope had three sons: *Anthony Cope, the subject of this biography. *William Cope, who died unmarried. *Sir John Cope (before 1513 ‚Äì 22 January 1558) of Canons Ashby, Northamptonshire, who married firstly Bridget Raleigh, daughter of Edward Raleigh, esquire, of Farnborough, Warwickshire, by whom he had three sons, Erasmus, George and Anthony, and two daughters, Elizabeth and Joan; secondly Mary Mallory, widow of Clement Cave and daughter and coheiress of Nicholas Mallory, by whom he had no issue; and thirdly, before June 1542, Margaret Tame, widow of Sir Humphrey Stafford, and daughter and coheir of Sir Edmund Tame of Fairford, Gloucestershire, by his first wife Agnes Greville, daughter of John Greville, esquire, by whom he had no issue. The monument to William Cope in Banbury church records the death of his widow, Jane, on 12 February 1525. According to other sources, however, William Cope had three wives. Chambers says he married 'twice if not three times', and that his monument names his second and third wives Agnes and Jane, while a 'troublesome pedigree' from the Visitation of Hampshire shows a first wife, Barbara Quarles, daughter of George Quarles of Ufford, Northamptonshire, as the mother of his son, Stephen Cope. The online Dictionary of National Biography does not name William Cope's first two wives, but states that Anthony Cope was his 'second recorded son... by an unknown second wife', and that Anthony had 'at least one elder half-brother, Stephen, one brother, and four younger stepsisters (one of whom became Stephen's wife) who were the daughters of William Cope's third wife, Johane Spencer'. Career Anthony Cope attended Oxford, perhaps Oriel Oxford as Anthony Wood states, but does not appear to have taken a degree. He subsequently travelled to France, Germany and Italy. During his time on the continent he visited several universities, and is said to have written a number of books at that time, which may have included translations from Galen and Hippocrates mentioned by Erasmus in 1516. Wood states that his writing were the subject of an epigram by Johannes Baptista Mantuanus, seen at the one time by John Bale, but now lost. He was twenty-six years of age when his father died on 7 April 1513. He was heir to 'the manor of Hanwell, near Banbury, and other property near by'.According to Hunt he inherited 'an old manor house near Banbury called Hardwick'. He completed the building of Hanwell Hall, begun by his father. The Hall was later described by John Leland as 'a very pleasant and gallant house'. In 1536 he was granted the lands of the dissolved Brooke Priory'House of Austin Canons: Priory of Brooke', A History of the County of Rutland: Volume 1 (1908), pp. 159-161 Retrieved 1 December 2013. in Rutland, which he afterwards sold, and bought more property in Oxfordshire. He was engaged in a dispute with the vicar of Banbury in 1540, and received the commendation of the council for his conduct. He was first vice-chamberlain, and then principal chamberlain to Catherine Parr, and was knighted by Edward VI on 24 November 1547, being appointed in the same year one of the royal visitors of Canterbury and other dioceses. In 1548 he served as sheriff of Oxfordshire and Berkshire. Marriage and issue He married Jane Crewes, a daughter of Matthew Crewes of Pynne in the parish of Stockleigh English, Devon, by whom he had a son and daughter: *Edward Cope (d.1557), who married Elizabeth Mohun (d.1587), daughter and heir of Walter Mohun of Wollaston, Northamptonshire, by whom he had four sons and three daughters, including his eldest son and heir Sir Anthony Cope, 1st Baronet, and Sir Walter Cope, second cousin of Lady Burghley and longtime servant of both William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, and his son, Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury. *Anne Cope, who married Sir Kenelm Digby of Drystoke, Rutland. Death and burial He died on 5 January 1551, probably at Hanwell Hall, and was buried in the chancel of the parish church. His wife, to whom he bequeathed ¬£100 and an annuity of 100 marks, survived him. Works Cope was the author of: *The Historie of the two moste noble Capitaines in the Worlde, Anniball and Scipio ‚Ä¶ gathered and translated into Englishe out of T.

This episode marks the final appearance of Sprague Grayden (Donna Winston).https://www.eonline.com/fr/photos/13645/ranking- the-21-most-important-deaths-on-sons-of-anarchy/415108 Plot Abel is finally healthy enough to return home. Wendy walks in on a tender moment between Jax and Tara and realizes that Gemma is using her to get to Tara. Wendy confronts Gemma, then notifies Tara that she intends to mend her relationship with Jax and that Gemma is determined to sabotage Jax and Tara's relationship. Having sold all of their arms from Ireland and strapped for cash to pay for Bobby's legal defense, Clay plans to sell the club's own guns to the Mayans. In Oakland, Clay and Jax are to pick up the guns, while Tig and Opie drop off the money. However, Clay has given Tig orders to kill Opie. Eager to play both sides of the war between the Mayans and One-Niners, Clay also makes arrangements with Laroy Wayne - leader of the One-Niners - to ambush the sale. Clay and Jax escape the ambush unscathed, and when given the chance to kill Opie, Tig balks. Tig tells Clay that he didn't get a chance to kill Opie during the chaos of the ambush, so Clay orders Tig to finish the job after Abel's homecoming party and to make it look like a drive-by perpetrated by the One-Niners. Feeling guilty that Stahl's actions have framed an innocent man, Hale tells Unser about the bugs the ATF planted on Opie. He then angrily confronts Stahl, who is being pulled from the cold case. At Abel's homecoming, Tara kisses Jax in front of Wendy, and slaps Jax when he privately asks her not to rub their relationship in Wendy's face. Tara leaves, as does Opie and his family. Opie takes the kids home in Donna's car, and Donna takes Opie's truck to run some errands for Gemma, who is busy hosting the party. Unser shows up at the party and tells Clay that Opie is innocent. Clay attempts to call off the hit, but Tig misses the call and shoots at Opie's truck with an UZI, accidentally killing Donna. SAMCRO is quick to arrive at the crime scene, and as everyone consoles a devastated Opie, Jax shoots a furious glare at Clay, and Hale blames a shocked Stahl for Donna's death. Back at their home, Wendy consoles Jax and the two have sex. Reception IGN gave \\"The Sleep of Babies\\" a 7.2/10.0 rating, stating, \\"A lot of things are going to change after this. Opie will be a different person, Agent Stahl will be gone and it looks like Deputy Chief Hale is starting to switch into becoming Unser (which was one of the easier transitions). But this episode was the show's chance to show what it was made of, and while some of the execution was good, it was mostly a letdown.

Tipple was born at Camden, Oneida County, New York on December 1, 1868, the son of Martin Tipple (7 March 1819 - 16 May 1901) and Sara Elizabeth Squier (June 1841 - 3 June 1916). His brother was Ezra Squier Tipple (1861‚Äì1936). He was educated at Cazenovia Seminary, graduating in 1890, then on to Syracuse University where he would receive his A.B. in 1894, and ten years later a D.D. (1904). While at Syracuse, he was a member of the Delta Upsilon fraternity, serving as recording secretary and president. He lived in the D.U. house and had as a fellow brother, also living in the house, Stephen Crane. During his college years he served as an editor for the monthly University Herald, played baseball, studied classical history, and was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa Society. He also served as a correspondent for the New York Tribune and the Mail and Express, and for the Post-Standard of Syracuse.Who Was Who in America, v. 5, 1969-1973, p. 724. Chicago: A. N.

Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press. Following college, Tipple pursued a career as a clergyman. He studied at Drew Theological Seminary, graduating in 1897 with his B.D. degree and was ordained in the Methodist Episcopal Church. While at Drew, he served as assistant pastor of Grace M.E. Church, New York City. He married Jane Baldwin Downs on 2 June 1897. She was also a graduate of Syracuse (1895) and a member of Alpha Phi.Smalley, F., ed. (1904). Alumni Record and General Catalogue of Syracuse University 1899-1904, vol. 2, p. 140. Syracuse: Alumni Association. He served as pastor of Epworth M.E.

Church, in Stamford until 1909.New York Charities Directory, p. 535. New York: Charity Organization Society, 1903.\\"Tipple is from Brooklyn: Head of Methodist Church in Rome formerly preached there.\\" The New York Times, 6 April 1910. In 1909 Tipple accepted a call to be pastor of the American Methodist Episcopal Church in Rome, Italy. The new position was to afford him the opportunity to pursue missionary work, for at the time there were only about ten members.The Alpha Phi Quarterly 21 (1908): 261. He was very busy during his stay in Rome and accepted many new responsibilities. From 1910 until 1923 he was president of Reeder Theological Seminary, which prepared boys for the Methodist ministry in Italy. Perhaps most prominently, he was the founder and president of Methodist International College (Collegio Internazionale di Monte Mario) from 1911 until 1923. The Methodists were in continual conflict with the Vatican during Tipple's fourteen years in Rome. The most famous incident occurred in early April 1910, when ex-President Theodore Roosevelt, during his six-week tour through Europe, failed to meet with the Pope. The Pontiff did not want the ex- president to also call on the Methodist mission while in Rome. Roosevelt, who had had no intention of such a visit, was incensed by the restriction that Pius X seemed to be making on him and declined to call on him. The episode, which was mostly the result of misunderstandings, caused quite a stir.Abbott, L. (1910). \\"The Facts of the Vatican Incident.\\" The Outlook 94:776-78.

In 1914, Tipple secured six acres at the southern end of Monte Mario, one of the most beautiful locations near the city. He planned on a large-scale building program to expand the college; however, his plans were met with strong opposition from the Holy See.\\"Methodists Buy Rome Site.\\" The New York Times, 26 January 1914.\\"The Methodists on the Hills of Rome.\\" The Literary Digest, vol. 70, no. 7 (13 August 1921): 28-29.

During 1910 to 1924 Tipple embarked on numerous lecture trips throughout the United States, Great Britain, France, and Germany. He was a delegate to the world convention of the YMCA at Robert College in Constantinople in 1911 and a delegate to the Ecumenical Conference in Edinburgh, 1913. From 1912 to 1924 he was correspondent-at-large in Europe and North Africa for The Christian Science Monitor. During World War I, he maintained social service rooms in the Methodist building in Rome for British and American soldiers and sailors. He was received at the Italian Court in 1910. In July, 1915, he was conferred Knight of the Order of the Crown of Italy (Cavaliere dell' Ordine della Corona d'Italia) by King Victor Emanuel III and in 1920 he was made Commander of the Order of the Crown of Italy for making Americans aware of Italy's sacrifice during the Great war.Phi Kappa Phi Journal 1 (1915): 368. Tipple was also a Mason (33rd degree of Italy). In his later years he focused on traveling, lecturing and writing.

The Municipal Conservatory of Barcelona (, ) is a teaching institution, which is devoted to music education. The present ownership belongs to the Barcelona City Hall. History The beginnings took place in 1886; it was founded by the Municipal Band of Barcelona as a school of music, so that the new musicians of the band could be trained there. Other cities that had a band had made the same thing, since they had the same necessity. The first director was :ca:Josep Rodoreda, until in 1896 Antoni Nicolau replaced him. In 1911 the position of assistant director was created. The first assistant director was Enric Morera until 1935. In 1930, when a new director was needed for the band, Llu√≠s Millet was elected. He was more conservative and he was preferred by the Barcelona City Hall. His election for this position created some polemics. In the meantime, in 1928 the conservatory building was placed in the corner between Bruc and Val√®ncia streets. Millet left the position in the year that the Spanish Civil War ended (1939). The next year, :ca:Joan Baptista Lambert replaced him until 1945. During this time, the institution was transformed from a music school into a conservatory. In 1945 a new studies plan was introduced, which was based on the 1942 decree that unified the studies in all the conservatories of Spain. When Lambert died Joaquim Zamacois was the new director until 1965. During this period, contacts with other European conservatories were made, important musicians from all Europe were invited, and a new department for ancient music was created. It was also created the Barcelona Music Museum. In 1952 Joan Pich i Santasusana was appointed assistant director, first provisionally until 1968 and officially appointed until 1977. According to the arrival of democracy to Spain, important efforts were made in order to update this institution, and also to decentralize it, since it was during that time the only public educational music institution of the city. Moreover, during Pich's term of office a new studies plan was introduced, according to a 1966 decree. This studies plan ruled the professional music education for four decades. So that the students could perform concerts during their formation, the construction of an auditorium was envisaged, but Xavier Turull (who was appointed director in 1977) inaugurated it. During this period, the students orchestra (conducted by Edmon Colomer) had a certain stability, the Music Museum was moved to the Quadras house, and the first steps in order to create the Library of the Conservatory were made. He resigned in 1982 due to disagreements with the City Hall, and first Maria Cateura and afterwards :ca:Mar√ßal Gols succeeded him. He made important reforms, decentralizing the institution, limiting the registration in certain instruments, reducing the teachers in certain specialities, and promoting the registration in string instruments. But not everyone in the institution understood these reforms, and he resigned. He was replaced by Pilar Figueras and then Francesca Ruiz (1988‚Äì1997) and Carme Vil√†. In 2001, when the Education Department of the Generalitat de Catalunya opened the Superior School of Music of Catalonia (ESMuC), the Municipal Superior Conservatory of Music of Barcelona did not teach superior music studies any more, and thus it changed its name. At the same time, many teachers began to teach in the new institution. Since then, the Conservatory has adapted its task to the new situation, inside the Municipal Institute of Education of Barcelona. In this context, many municipal schools of music have been created as well.

History  Kensal Rise Library was opened by Mark Twain, who had been staying nearby at Dollis Hill House, whose guests have included Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone and which was later used by Winston Churchill's War Cabinet. At the ceremony, Mark Twain gave the Library Committee chairman five of his books and a signed photograph. In autumn 1964 the Children's Library was moved into the 1928 extension.

Brent Council put forward proposals to close the library in November 2010. The proposals were met with widespread condemnation and significant media coverage, and protests at council meetings. Philip Pullman described the proposed closure as \\"barbarism\\". The campaign to save the library was supported by Alan Bennett, Zadie Smith, Nick Cave and the Pet Shop Boys. All Souls College sold the building in April 2015, to Uplift Properties Ltd, stipulating to the buyer that Friends of Kensal Rise Library have a rent free space for a community library on the ground floor of the library building. An open day was held inside the library building on 6 June 2015, and after an estimated ¬£200,00 of refurbishment costs, the new library opened in 2016. In 1994, the interior was refurbished in a Neo-Edwardian style. After the closure of the library, volunteers from the local community set up a pop-up library outside. By late 2018, Friends of Kensal Rise Library had signed a long lease for part of the ground floor, following refurbishment. The library part of the building has been open for various community and fundraising events in 2018 and 2019. Book shelving is in place and KRCL was open for book donations from 7 to 13 April 2019.

Subsequently, Cotton studied successively at Henry Hickman's academy at Stourbridge, in Westmoreland at Richard Frankland's Natland Academy, and at the University of Edinburgh, where he was awarded an M.A. in 1677.Joshua Toulmin; An historical view of the state of the Protestant Dissenters in England; Bath and London, 1814. On leaving college, he accepted a position as chaplain to Lady Sarah Houghton, daughter of the Earl of Chesterfield, for about a year, after which ill-health forced him to leave. He then conducted a small chapel at his father's house, until persecution forced him to stop. He then accepted a position as tutor and governor to a young gentleman, and spent three years touring Europe, during which he witnessed the ejection of Protestant ministers at Loudun, Poitou and Saumur, which he later described in the unpublished memoirs of his travels.quoted in Joshua Toulmin; op. cit.

His father, John de Leigh, who was lord of the manor of Over Knutsford and seated at Norbury Booths, descended in the male line from the Venable family. Robert de Leigh, lieutenant to Sir Thomas de Ferrers ‚ÄúLieutenant of the Prince‚Äôs Bachelor‚Äù, was a Riding-Forester of the Forest of Macclesfield, Bailiff of the Hundred of Macclesfield and a Justice in Eyre for Cheshire. Robert de Legh, the second in succession, was one of the Black Prince's Esquires. Sir Robert Legh the third in succession was knighted during the reign of Richard II. He was twice Sheriff of Cheshire. He fought at the Battle of Shrewsbury in 1403 against Henry IV. Robert Legh the fourth in succession was preparing to take part in the Battle of Agincourt but died of pestilence ten days before the battle. Some years after the dissolution of the monasteries, Thomas Legh the tenth in succession acquired the rights to the manor of Prestbury, together with the advowson of the parish church and tithes. Leghs became patrons of the Living and Lay Rectors of Prestbury as they still are. Thomas Legh served as High Sheriff of Cheshire for 1588/89. Sir Urian Legh was knighted for military services by taking C√°diz in 1596. He was appointed High Sheriff in 1613. Thomas Legh (1593‚Äì1644), the twelfth in succession, was twice High Sheriff of Cheshire (1629 and 1642) and a Colonel in the Royalist Army during the Civil War. He lost Adlington Hall in December 1642 but regained it later. In February 1644 the house was again besieged. This time it had to be surrendered to the Parliamentarians in order to prevent severe damage. It was not returned to the family until 1656 after heavy fines had been paid. Thomas Legh (1614‚Äì1687), the thirteenth in succession, was gazetted Colonel of Militia and appointed High Sheriff in 1662 in recognition of his services to the Stuarts. The next three in succession were also Colonels of Militia and High Sheriffs, John (the fifteenth) also serving as MP for Bodmin from 1715 to 1722.

Sir Charles Cornwallis. Life He was the second son of Sir Thomas Cornwallis, controller of Queen Mary's household, who had been imprisoned by Elizabeth in 1570. He was probably born at his father's house of Brome Hall, Suffolk. Nothing is known of Cornwallis till 11 July 1603, when he was knighted. In 1604 he was Member of Parliament for Norfolk. Early in 1605 he was sent as resident ambassador to Spain. He was active in attempting to protect English merchants from the Spanish Inquisition, and lobbied the home government for English commercial interests. He was recalled in September 1609, and his secretary, Francis Cottington, took his place at Madrid. In 1610 he became treasurer of the household of Henry, Prince of Wales, resisted the proposal to marry the prince to a daughter of the Duke of Savoy, and attended his master through his fatal illness of 1612. He was a candidate for the post of master of the wards in the same year; was one of four commissioners sent to Ireland on 11 September 1613 to investigate Irish grievances, and reported that Ireland had no very substantial ground for complaint. In 1614 Cornwallis was suspected of fanning the parliamentary opposition to the king. John Hoskins, who had made himself conspicuous in the House of Commons of England by his denunciation of Scots and Scottish institutions, declared when arrested that he was Cornwallis's agent. Cornwallis disclaimed all knowledge of Hoskins, but admitted that he had procured the election of another member of parliament, and had supplied him with notes for a speech against recusants and Scotchmen. The privy council placed Cornwallis under arrest in June 1614, and he was imprisoned in the Tower of London for a year, with Hoskins and Leonel Sharp. Cornwallis, who at one time lived at Beeston St Andrew, Norfolk, as well as in Suffolk, retired late in life to Harborne, Staffordshire, where he died on 21 December 1629. He was buried in London at St. Giles in the Fields.

After being convicted of land fraud, he lived as a fugitive for several months before capture, wrote a book after conviction, received a Presidential pardon, and later was convicted of mail fraud. Early life Puter was born on January 6, 1857 in Trinity County, California, and moved with his family to Humboldt County, California two years later. As a young man, he worked as a surveyor and a logger. He left California in 1888 and moved to Portland, Oregon. Oregon land fraud scandal Early in the 20th century, Puter was instrumental in carrying out the Oregon land fraud scandal, which transferred tens of thousands of acres of federal lands given to the Oregon and California Railroad to private hands, ultimately benefiting large timber companies and some Oregon politicians, including U.S. Senators John H. Mitchell and Binger Hermann, who was later exonerated. Puter was considered the kingpin of the scandal. In 1902, he took his family to Berkeley, California. He was indicted early in 1905; allegations besides the land schemes included bribing then-Senator Mitchell $2,000. Puter fled Oregon before being sentenced as had two of the other defendants. Oregon authorities declared their intention to apprehend him and McKinley anywhere in the world, and sent photographs through U. S. diplomatic channels.https://cdnc.ucr.edu/?a=d&d;=LAH19060125&dliv;=userclipping&cliparea;=1.1%2C3577%2C3348%2C707%2C1004&factor;=2&e;=------190-en --20--1-byDA-txt-txIN-S.+A.+D.+Puter----1906---1 McKinley fled to China on a steamship; Puter escaped capture by U.S. Secret Service officers in an armed confrontation in Boston, Massachusetts in March and was subsequently a fugitive for several months before being captured in late May 1906 by the Alameda, California police who also discovered weapons in his rented room.

In 1906, while incarcerated, Puter co-wrote the book Looters of the Public Domain with Horace Stevens, a former land office clerk. In the detailed tell-all, Puter both confessed to and accused others of their role in the scandal, and in it were portraits of his co-conspirators and copies of documents confirming their criminal acts. In his book he wrote a clear statement of the scope of the scandal: > Thousands upon thousands of acres, which included the very cream of timber > claims in Oregon and Washington, were secured by Eastern lumberman and > capitalists,‚Ä¶and nearly all of the claims, to my certain knowledge, were > fraudulently obtained. The timber land scandals were not limited to Oregon. The California Redwood Company in Humboldt County had also been running a claim scheme to secure title to thousands of acres of redwood timberlands. President Theodore Roosevelt pardoned Puter after he had served 18 months of his sentence so that he could turn state's evidence. His testimony led to the indictment of Mitchell, Hermann and John N. Williamson, who made up three-fourths of Oregon's congressional delegation, as well as a number of other prominent Oregonians and federal officials. In 1907 he testified to having bribed a grand jury during the land schemes in Oregon. Later life and death Puter's son, R. C. Puter, was charged with criminal negligence in 1915, after he allegedly hit and killed Mary Logan with his car in the San Francisco Bay Area. He was expected to be tried on a charge of manslaughter. In July 1916, Stephen A. Douglas Puter was indicted, along with seven others (including his two sons and a son-in-law), for \\"Illegal Use of the Mails and Fraud\\" during the perpetration of the land fraud scandal. S. A. D. Puter, who was in New York at the time, declared himself the leader of those indicted, and insisted that they were innocent of any charges of fraud. He traveled by train to San Francisco, where he turned himself in. He and his sons were listed as residents of Berkeley, California; the son-in-law was from San Francisco. Several years later, in what was described in an International News Service item as \\"the final echo of the Oregon land fraud cases,\\" four of the eight co- defendants entered guilty pleas. They were fined; the highest amount, $1500, was assessed to S. A. D. Puter. Puter died May 10, 1931 in Burlingame, California.

Life Andrew Coventry, born in February 1762, was eldest son of Rev George Coventry, minister of Stitchell in Roxburghshire. Through his mother, Elizabeth Horn, he inherited the estate of Shanwell, near Kinross, and some other landed property in Perthshire. He was educated at the university of Edinburgh, and on 15 December 1782 elected a member of the Medical Society of Edinburgh.List of Members of the Medical Society of Edinburgh, 1820 In September 1783 he graduated M.D. for a thesis De Scarlatina Cynanchica.List of Graduates in Medicine in University of Edinburgh, 1867. It is not clear whether he ever practised as a physician; but he appears to have specialised in the sciences bearing upon agriculture. On 7 July 1790 Sir William Pulteney took the first steps towards endowing a chair of agriculture at Edinburgh, and nominated Coventry as the first professor. Occasional lectures on the subject had earlier been delivered by other professors, e.g. by the professor of chemistry, Dr. William Cullen, at the instigation of Lord Kames. A much fuller course had also been given by John Walker, then professor of natural history, in 1788. Coventry's large Edinburgh townhouse at 29 Moray Place The new chair's foundation seems to have been regarded with a good deal of jealousy: the professor of natural history protested that he was not to be hindered thereby from teaching 'any branch of natural science,' to which the professor of botany objected as infringing his rights; Coventry, for his part, insisted that none but himself had the right to give 'a separate course of georgical lectures.' Moreover, the endowment and patronage of a university chair by a private individual was unprecedented at the time, and seems to have aroused opposition. In spite of these obstacles Coventry became, on 17 November 1790, the first professor of agriculture in the university, and continued to hold the post until 1831. The endowment of the chair amounted to only ¬£50 per annum; but Coventry supplemented his work as a teacher by many other duties. 'He was constantly called on to arbitrate in land questions, and to give evidence before the court of session and before committees of the House of Commons; the drainage of Loch Leven and the reclamation of the surrounding lands were carried out under his directions'.Alex. Grant, Story of the University of Edinburgh, 1884, i. 345-7 Coventry gave evidence before the royal commission appointed in 1826 to investigate the condition of the universities and colleges of Scotland, when he said that he had delivered thirty-two courses, some of them, consisting of more than 140 lectures each. Although the subject he taught was not available for a degree granting graduation, he had attracted classes varying in number from thirty to seventy- eight. It is often overlooked that one of his star pupils was none other than John Claudius Loudon, a person that can be safely described as the father of professional horticulture. In fact his, An Encyclopedia of Gardening has been praised by Sir Jeffrey Jellicoe, as \\"The first book to treat the subject comprehensively from this historical, technical, aesthetic, and horticultural points of view.\\" Jellico, Sir Jeffrey et al Oxford U. Press 1991 Towards the end of his tenure of office, however, he appears to have lectured only in alternate years, 'persuading persons who wished to attend him during any session when he was to be absent to put off doing so, and to attend the classes of chemistry and botany in the meantime.' The royal commission, which concluded its labours in 1830, recommended among other reforms that the chair of agriculture should be abolished 'unless a class could be provided for it, and taught regularly.' In 1792 Coventry was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Daniel Rutherford, James Gregory, and Sir James Hall.https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf His address was then given as 29 Moray Place, an impressive townhouse on the Moray Estate in western Edinburgh.

By his second marriage he had a son, also Andrew Coventry (1801‚Äì1877) who was an advocate and also a Director of the Commercial Bank of Scotland. He followed in his father's footsteps in also being a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Works In addition to the thesis referred to above, Coventry wrote:The treatises attributed to him by Grant, on Dairy Produce and The Succession of Crops and the Valuation of Soils, are not to be found either in the British Museum or in the library of the Faculty of Advocates. They are perhaps identical with the first and third work listed below. The Andrew Coventry who in 1829 edited, and presented to the Bannatyne Club, Petruccio Ubaldini's 'Descrittione del regno di Scotia' was a different person, in spite of the direct statement made against his name in the British Museum Catalogue; he was an advocate, and would appear, from the list of members of the Bannatyne Club published in 1846, to have been still living in that year. A third Andrew Coventry, also declared in the British Museum Catalogue to be the professor of agriculture, delivered the Ulbster Hall lecture 'On some of the most curious inventions and discoveries in recent times,' which was printed for private circulation in 1856. *Remarks on Live Stock and relative Subjects, 1806 (not in British Museum, but in library of Faculty of Advocates) *Discourses explanatory of the Object and Plan of the Course of Lectures on Agriculture and Rural Economy, 1808. *Notes on the Culture and Cropping of Arable Land, 1811.

Sin Pelos en la Lengua is funded \\"by Pichileminian businessmen, some merchants, and citizens.\\" In May 2010, Moraga was sued for libel and slander by Dante Cornejo, municipal administrator during Mayor Roberto C√≥rdova's government, after Moraga reportedly \\"gave an information that involved Cornejo [...] that wasn't veracious,\\" in his program Sin Pelos en la Lengua. Dante Cornejo appeared with his attorney Fabricio Jim√©nez -- who also works as Legal Counsel of the Municipality of Pichilemu, and was Governor of Cardenal Caro Province between 2004 and 2006 -- during the trial against Moraga in the Court of Pichilemu. Mario Moraga eventually apologized, retracting his 'defamatory statements', on November 9, 2010.
