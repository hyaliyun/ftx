Preparation began in 1900, when the old school was sold and the revenue used to purchase a lot. After additional funds were raised through donations, construction work began in 1908 and was completed in 1911, at which point it went into use. The present institution was established in 1923, following the union of Transylvania with Romania, when it became the first Romanian-language high school in Bistri»õa.

Responses to the site include the American Association of University Professors and The New York Times raising fears that it threatens academic freedoms by harassing and intimidating staff, conservative magazine National Review describing it as an \\"irritable gesture\\" of victimhood by conservatives, and concerns about the safety and welfare of staff following a trend of threatening behaviour and communication, including rape and death threats, being sent to listed faculty. Concerns have also been raised about the process in which academic staff are listed. Professors have reported being listed for any discussion of race or politics, including in academic publications. Julio Cesar Pino, a professor of Latin American history, was added to the list on the basis of rumours that the FBI may have investigated him for having connections to ISIS. Lamb, a director of constitutional enforcement and transparency at Turning Point, has described the site as \\"simply aggregating\\" professors who have been the subject of news reports. In December 2016, 1500 professors and faculty from across the globe petitioned have their name added to the list in solidarity with academics who had been targeted and intimidated following their listing, with the message that the listed are ‚Äúthe sort of company we wish to keep.‚Äù Turning Point UK also maintains a similar site, Education Watch, which has been described as \\"McCarthyism in the UK\\", despite gaining support from Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg and Home Secretary Priti Patel. The Council for the Defence of British Education has also called Education Watch \\"populist rightwing propaganda\\". Sources Campus Reform, a part of the Leadership Institute, and Discover the Networks, a website run by the David Horowitz Freedom Center, were the sources for most of the professors on the Professor Watchlist. Response Slate columnist Rebecca Schuman described the website as \\"abjectly terrifying\\" and said that she feared for the safety of the listed professors. Some have criticized the website as a threat to academic freedom; Hans-Joerg Tiede, the associate secretary for the American Association of University Professors' department of academic freedom, tenure and governance, told The New York Times: \\"There is a continuing cycle of these sorts of things. They serve the same purpose: to intimidate individuals from speaking plainly in their classrooms or in their publications.\\" One professor included in the site, George Yancy, wrote that it is \\"essentially a new species of McCarthyism, especially in terms of its overtones of 'disloyalty' to the American republic\\". According to Inside Higher Ed, some critics consider the website \\"more annoying than dangerous\\". Critics including Peter Dreier of Occidental College‚Äîwho is listed on the site for having criticized the National Rifle Association and using Howard Zinn's A People's History of the United States as a required text‚Äîhave pointed out errors of fact that may make Professor Watchlist less than reliable as a source of information. Dreier's entry formerly listed him as a former employee of the Industrial Areas Foundation and as the man who inspired college student Barack Obama to become a community organizer. Dreier identifies these claims about him as \\"complete fantasy\\". He also noted elements of his biography that the website completely omitted, such as his work with labor unions, his activism in favor of a minimum wage, and the books he wrote. Kent State professor Julio Pino said to The New York Times the site is \\"a kind of normalizing of prosecuting professors, shaming professors, defaming professors.\\" The website's organizers say that it simply provides conservative students with a guide to their professors, akin to Ratemyprofessors.com, enabling them to avoid left-wing classes. Over one hundred University of Notre Dame faculty members signed an open letter asking to be included in the site, saying in part: In response to the Notre Dame letter, University of Chicago psychology professor Leslie Kay started the website \\"Free Academics\\". This website lists the names of professors across the United States who have signed it to ask for their names to be added to the list. As of December 2016, it had over 1,500 signatories.

History Old logo of the Tagaytay Highlands Construction of condominiums in the Tagaytay Highlands, 2008. Willy Ocier of Belle Corporation was behind the concept of Tagaytay Highlands and patterned it after the life he wished for himself and his family, which he deemed acceptable to the growing population of young professionals of his time. He conceptualized the development as a place for people in the city, particularly in Metro Manila to escape the busy city life. Henry Sy of the SM Group influenced Ocier to enter the property development industry. Ocier, who was looking for a business partner for Tagaytay Highlands approached Sy, who declined. Sy was skeptical due to Tagaytay's rugged terrain. However Sy's prediction of Tagaytay becoming the next recreation center for Metro Manila residents in the 1980s led Ocier to invest in Tagaytay. Ocier decided to push through with his father, Benito Tan Guat's support. Roberto Ongpin was a partner of Ocier in the project. Tagaytay Highlands would later be established in April 1994. Tagaytay Highlands, including its golf course, are among the establishments affected by ash fall caused by 2020 Taal Volcano eruption. Residential developments Residential areas are being developed within the mountain resort and are divided into three parts namely Highlands, Midlands, and Greenlands. Among the developments inside the Highlands area of the Tagaytay Highlands is the Woodridge Place, a condominium complex composed of 9 buildings. The architectural design of the buildings were inspired from the designs of mountain resort and ski lodge buildings in Colorado, United States. A residential area patterned after the mountain resort town of Aspen, Colorado named Aspenhills is situated also within the Highlands. In the Midlands, are residential developments patterned from architecture from different countries. Among these is Katsura which was derived from the Katsura Palace in Kyoto, Japan. Sport Tagaytay Highlands hosts sporting facilities at its Sports Center which has a swimming pool, a basketball court, billiard hall, a bowling alley, tennis, badminton, and squash courts, as well as a children's playground.

In the 1960s, South Korea began to transform from an agricultural economy to an industrial, service and high-tech economy. The country's per capita GDP increased from US $100 in 1963 to US $35,300 in 2014, making South Korea the world's 20th largest economy. In the process, work hours increased. According to OECD figures, work hours in South Korea were 2,005 per worker in 2018. Korea ranks 3rd worldwide, compared to 1,786 hours in the US, 1,538 hours in the UK, and 1,363 hours in Germany (the shortest). Koreans work such long hours because of the Korean industrial system and nighttime culture. South Korea's corporate culture resembles that of Japan‚Äìhierarchical and with significant subcontracting. Even though Korea has a statutory working week of 40 hours and allows 12 hours of paid overtime on weekdays and 16 hours on weekends, manufacturing industries such as the automobile industry operate non-stop. In addition, cafes, transportation, pubs, restaurants, private study rooms, shopping malls, and fast food restaurants also operate continuously. Although the Labor Standard Act sets statutory limits, enforcement is weak and employers routinely violate the Act.  Different working hours in terms of jobs and productivity  As of 2014, 80.7% of the Labor Standard Act had been implemented. The 40 hour working week met with 93% success in the manufacturing industry as compared with 73.1% elsewhere. Implementation in the public sector (99%) is higher than in the private sector (80.5%). Male workers in manufacturing industry are allowed 24.10 overtime work hours while non-manufacturing workers get 10.90 hours. Public sector can work 11.06 hours overtime, while private sector workers are allowed 16.06 hours. Even though Korea has implemented the 40 hour work week, workers in South Korea appear satisfied with their job and lives. A higher salary has a positive and significant impact on worker' job and life satisfaction. They tend to be satisfied with longer hours. However, longer work hours do not necessarily mean greater productivity. Employers use overtime because the costs are much less (9,045 won/hr or $8) than e.g., in France, where businesses are heavily taxed.

Following demilitarization, arsenal machinery was used for manufacture of civilian goods by the state owned conglomerate Deutsche Werke AG.

Cannabis is known locally as diamba. History Cannabis is believed to have become commonly cultivated in Sierra Leone well before it became widespread in West Africa. Midwives used it as anaesthesia for childbirth, and fishermen used it to deal with their difficult labors. An 1851 journal article reported that cannabis had been \\"long in use\\" in the interior of Sierra Leone, and claimed that cannabis seeds were brought to the colony by \\"Congoes captured by one of our cruisers.\\" Sierra Leonean sailors and stevedores played a role in disseminating cannabis regionally, spreading the use of the drug to Ghana and Gambia. Cannabis was first banned in Sierra Leone in 1920, during the country's British colonial period; cannabis was included in that year as an addendum to the nation's 1913 Opium Act. Cultivation The 2011 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report noted that cannabis is widely cultivated in Sierra Leone, to the degree that the national government was concerned that cannabis may be crowding out subsistence farming and threatening food security. Popularity A doctor stated to Sierra Leone's Truth and Reconciliation Committee in 2003: \\"Cannabis sativa is so commonly used or abused in Sierra Leone... that I don't think people consider it a crime any more to use it...

The council was established on 5 January 1888 following the passage of the District Councils Act 1887. It comprised the cadastral hundreds of Brownlow, Cadell, Eba, Hay, Krichauff (later renamed Beatty), Lindley, Schomburgk (later renamed Maude) and Stuart. It had nine councillors at its inception, appointed by the Governor, and held its first meeting at the Terminus Hotel at Morgan. The first elections were held in June and July 1888. It was subdivided into four wards of two councillors each on 11 August 1892: No. 1 (Morgan township and suburban areas), No. 2 (Eba, Krichauff and Cadell), No. 3 (Stuart, Lindley and Schomburgk) and No. 4 (Hay and Brownlow). A permanent council chamber was built in Fourth Street, Morgan in 1894. On 30 July 1902, the Hundred of Brownlow was severed from Morgan and added to the District Council of Neales as its Brownlow Ward, while the remainder of No. 4 Ward continued as-is. The original council chamber burnt down in 1917, resulting in the destruction of all early council records. A new council chamber was built in 1918. In 1923, the total area under its control was 553,440 acres, with a ratable capital value of ¬£175,600. It included 241 areas of parklands, an oval and a square, with the total length of roading being 30 miles. A fifth ward was gazetted in 1925 to cover the influx of soldier settlers to the Cadell Irrigation Area. In the 1960s, there was a boundary dispute between the Morgan council and the District Council of Waikerie over the previously unincorporated Hundreds of Markaranka and Pooginook: they were added to Waikerie as the new Taylorville Ward on 4 July 1960, severed and attached to Morgan on 18 April 1963, but returned to Waikerie on 1 July 1965 following further controversy. In 1986, the district primarily served as a service centre for the surrounding pastoral and irrigation areas and as a tourist attraction, both for Morgan's heritage and for the Murray River itself. It covered an area of 2,151 square kilometres, and had a population of approximately 1,300 as of the 1981 census, chiefly of British or European background. Alongside the main township of Morgan, it also included the smaller townships of Cadell and Mount Mary. The primary industries of the district were wool production and fruitgrowing, with tourism, the Highways Dockyard for ferry maintenance, the Morgan‚ÄìWhyalla pipeline pumping station and the Cadell Training Centre being sources of secondary industry. The council was involved in the provision of camping and caravan facilities, and at that time, in the absence of any regular public transport also provided a community bus to connect to the nearest Adelaide service at Blanchetown. It ceased to exist on 1 July 1997, when it amalgamated with the District Council of Mannum, the District Council of Ridley-Truro and part of the District Council of Mount Pleasant to form the Mid Murray Council.

Iceland was seen as a lagging country compared to other European countries in terms of family policy. Family policy in Iceland had been long ignored by its policy makers. Not until 1994 when the United Nations celebrated the Year of Family. After the recognition of the importance of family by the United Nations, Iceland's parliament sought to establish a resolution to the concept of family policy that was gaining greater political attention in Iceland.  History  = Past policies = During the 1990s, before the United Nations' Year of Family Iceland was spending roughly 18% GDP on welfare and health care. This percentage was quite low compared to other European countries. This percentage spent on both healthcare and welfare seemed looked even thinner because Iceland has more children per family than other European countries with more progressive health care and social policies. After Iceland made the decision to implement more progressive family policies the Minister of Social Affairs appointed The Family Council in 1998. This council helped implement policies like those for paternity leave in 1998 which allowed men to take one third of the paid parental leave. During the 1990s there was also policies enacted that gave both men and women equal legal care for children. Children's care hours and after school activities were more highly funded during this time to establish more child friendly policies for working-class families. These policies were quite essential to Iceland's work force because on average more married men and women took part in the public and private workforce of Iceland. Numerous progressive policies have been established for Iceland since the 1900s so that the position of the Icelandic family would be strengthened. = Modern changes = The Icelandic family policy framework has shifted greatly from a model that was established as a single \\"breadwinner\\" family into a dual working and equal rights parent structure. In the years between 1970 and 1980 single parent households had proportionate rights. The modern model does strictly offer progressive benefits to families on the means test of income. Housing benefits have been a modern adaptation into the Icelandic family welfare system. Although there have been additional hours added to preschools in Iceland there are still no legal rights to preschool. There is financial assistance available to single and dual parent households. A single parent household receives about twice as much financial assistance than a dual parent household. This highlights the less progressive policies for wealth distribution. Iceland's family policy was re-structured for the equality of men and women in order to distribute balanced family welfare policies and its responsibilities. The framework of family is important to the people of Iceland because they believe social emotional connections develop from the home to the society around them. Although preschools are not mandatory for children to attend, Iceland sets up a structure that makes it most beneficial for both children and their working parents. Icelandic family policy makes child development a fundamental basis for much of their social policy in order to allow them to better develop their intellectual and emotional qualities at a younger age than most other countries. Work settings also help implement gender and family policies by private corporations implementing social policies to help support their government's mission for equality and progress. = Future goals = Since appointing a special Family Council in 1998 and the present Social Security system, Iceland has implemented substantial progressive family policies from extended preschool to counseling and education on sexual matters. Iceland's Social Security works hand in hand with municipalities and examines different provisions that could be introduced to not only better municipalities but the country as a whole. Although Iceland has made substantial progress in its parental leave policy, it still is shorter than other Nordic countries. Iceland passed and then repealed a policy that extended parental leave to twelve months which could have been compared to Sweden's 480 days of paid parental leave in 2016. In 2012, Eydal and Fri√∞riksd√≥ttir was passed and stated that parents who did not live with their children did not receive any benefits from the family welfare policies. Fertility rates have always remained constant or have never been an issue to agrees until recent years. In 2014, 4,326 births were reported which was a decline from 4,533 in 2012. This compared to fertility rates in 1950 when women were having more than four children per household. The age of first time mothers was up from 27 in 2013 to 30 in 2013. These trend are due to a highly developed work force and equal rights for men and women. Women are choosing careers that used to be synonymous to men and are taking advantage of the career opportunities earned. Costs of living have gone up as well as costs of normal and cheap goods which alarms prospective first time parents to be more financially secure. The decrease in fertility is also in part due to the education and counseling that both men and women receive in Iceland at a young age in sexual reproduction. Those who choose to have children are incentivized with progressive policies aiming at enhancing both emotional and physical stability and progress. Children have universal benefits in Iceland if they age 7 years of age or less. The Social Security System in Iceland re-affirms how critical these early years are for children especially in terms of instilling social and intellectual frameworks in the minds of children who will become the leaders of that same country as well as political activists.

He first served as a soldier but decided to instead become a priest and so entered the Franciscans and made his profession prior to ordination. He also became known for his simplistic preaching and for his generous outreach to the poor through the distribution of clothing and food. His beatification was celebrated on 9 June 1991 in the capital of Warsaw on the occasion of Pope John Paul II visiting the nation. Life Melchor Chyli≈Ñski was born on 8 January 1694 in the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland to Jan Chyli≈Ñski and Marianna Ma≈Çgorzata; his relations often nicknamed him as \\"the little monk\\" due to his pious nature. He later graduated from the Jesuit- run college in Pozna≈Ñ and decided to enter the armed forces in its cavalry section where he was made an officer three years later. On 4 April 1715 - despite the objections of his comrades - he joined the Order of Friars Minor Conventual in Krak√≥w and changed his name during the course of his novitiate to \\"Rafal\\". He was ordained to the priesthood in December 1717 after having made his perpetual profession on 26 April 1716. He was assigned to parishes in nine separate cities before being sent to the place that he would spend the remainder of his life in and he distributed food and clothing to the poor and sick people there; he also played the harp and the lute as well as the mandolin for liturgical hymns and spent 20 months in Warsaw ministering to epidemic victims. He was also known for his simple and candid sermons and for being an apt confessor. He died on 2 December 1741. Beatification Tomb. The beatification process started under Pope Clement XIV on 29 August 1772 and he became titled as a Servant of God; the confirmation of his life of heroic virtue allowed for Pope Pius XII to name him as Venerable. The miracle needed for beatification was investigated on a diocesan level and later received validation before receiving the approval of medical experts on 7 March 1990; theologians did so as well on 5 July 1990 as did the C.C.S. on 23 October 1990. Pope John Paul II approved this on 22 January 1991 and beatified the late Franciscan on 9 June 1991 in Warsaw during his apostolic visit there. The current postulator for this cause is Fra Angelo Paleri.

The group's 1998 debut album combined elements of the hardcore punk movement in D.C., as well as sentiments reminiscent of the first wave of punk music. In 2002, after a brief hiatus, the band released a second full-length, Rock Creek.  History  Originally known as the Dusters, the band formed in Washington, D.C. featuring the trio of Alec Bourgeios (lead guitar, vocals), Bill Colgrove (bass guitar, vocals), Ben Azzara (drums). All three band members possessed previous experience in earlier punk bands, including Bourgeios' group Severin which released four singles in the early 1990s, Azzara's Delta 72, and Colgrove with his New York- based act, Foundation. The trio made its live debut at the Black Cat nightclub in June 1996, sharing the bill with Regulator Watts and the Most Secret Method. In October 1996, the Dusters released the vinyl-only single, \\"Forest Fire\\" paired with \\"Seventeen\\", on Superbad Records, a subsidiary of Dischord Records. Three songs by the band were featured on a split EP in early 1997 with fellow D.C. group the Most Secret Method. Shortly after the EP was distributed, Colgrove departed the Dusters to establish his web design business called Threespot Media. Mark Lacrasse joined the band briefly as the Dusters' guest bassist in order to record their debut studio album, Simplicity. It was released in October 1998 under the name the Capitol City Dusters to avoid confusion between groups with a similar alias. After recruiting Jesse Quitsland, the band embarked on a US tour in late 1998 and early 1999 followed by a European tour accompanied with Spanish band Aina. The two acts concluded the tour with a split single, and the Capitol City Dusters took a year-long hiatus to rest from their hectic scheduling. By 2001, the band returned from their break to record their second album Rock Creek, released in April 2002. Recognized as a concept album, Allison Fields of Pitchfork noted Rock Creek possesses influences from Fugazi on several tracks, most notably the opening song \\"Superimposed\\". The styles of the band, as music critic Jimmy Askew wrote for Snap Pop magazine, perfected the blend \\"between Quitslund‚Äôs quirky arrangements and guitarist Alec Bourgeois‚Äô straightforward pop\\". Reception of the album was generally positive, as several reviews pointed to Rock Creek's stylistic similarities to early 1990s D.C. hardcore. To support the release of the album, the Capitol City Dusters conducted extensive tours throughout the US and Europe, often with Aina, throughout the year. Although the album and tour were the group's most successful to date, they decided to disband in 2003.

Initially the school American football team used borrowed property from the temporary school facilities. This is because the athletic field at Port Sulphur High, the temporary South Plaquemines High location, had no scoreboard, no working bleachers, and no working lights. \\\\- Print: p. D1, New York edition, \\"From a Hurricane To the Eye Of a Storm.\\" This meant that initially the football team had to make a roundtrip journey of in order to practice. \\\\- Print: page D3, New York edition, \\"Finding Their Way in the Dark.\\" In late August 2006 the field at Port Sulphur had been re-sodded, but it took weeks for the grass to grow. Further preparations came as new goal posts and scoreboards were installed. Cyril Crutchfield, who formerly coached the American football team of Port Sulphur High School, served as the football team coach of South Plaquemines after the school first opened; he remained as coach by 2009. In 2006 there was no gymnasium at the school and no band equipment, so unlike most teams, South Plaquemines did not have a band nor a pep rally. The team did not have a weight room nor a locker room. For its first season in 2006 it only had one home game. The players, many of whom had not played for years, came from schools that were previously rival teams and had used different playing styles. In 2007, at the beginning of the season, about one third of the players of the football team were still living in trailers provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Longman added that \\"It is in many ways remarkable that South Plaquemines qualified for the state playoffs in Class 2A\\" in 2006. The National Football League later gave a $35,000 grant, and Longman stated that it could be used for a weight room. Jer√© Longman of The New York Times wrote that the sport became \\"a refuge\\" for the post-Katrina South Plaquemines community. In its first season (2006), South Plaquemines lost to Clinton High School 48-16. In 2007 and 2008 South Plaquemines won Class 1A titles in the State of Louisiana, and in 2009 it was the 1A runner up. Steven Weins served as the coach until 2016. 34-year old Ferrante Dominique, previously of White Castle High School, became the coach of the football team of South Plaquemines High in 2016.

Cannabis is the most popular illegal drug in Suriname. Prohibition Cannabis was banned in Suriname (then a Dutch colony) in the early years of the 20th century. The drug had been popularized by the arrival of Asian immigrants in the colony. In 1921 the Surinamese Immigrants' Association requested that the ban on ganja be lifted and an import and sales concession be granted to them. Cultivation A 1982 report noted that cannabis was becoming more popular in Suriname, and was grown in abandoned plantations near the coastal plains, primarily for local consumption. A 1998 report noted anecdotal data that cannabis was cultivated in Suriname, but that the amounts were unknown. During the 2005 Caribbean Week of Agriculture, the Surinamese Minister of Agriculture stated: We know that we have problems with fertile soil. We know that our food import bill is too high. So when we talk about marijuana, personally, for Suriname, I [do] not agree at this moment to [say] let our farmers start producing marijuana. What we are stimulating is produce food for our people. Smuggling Suriname is noted as a key transshipment point for the smuggling of cannabis and cocaine to Europe. The Brazilian town of Bel√©m was noted as a particular contact point in the trade, given its proximity to Suriname and large Surinamese population.

Labor legislation is wide-ranging, with laws, regulations and statutes that bear on labor relations. The Constitution of Italy (articles 35-47) contains declarations of principle relating to fair payment, maximum working hours, vacation, protection of women and minors, social insurance, illness, disability, industrial diseases and accidents, Freedom of Association and the right to strike. The Workers' Statute of 1970 was modified, and plays an important role.  Law 350  Act of Law 350 enacted on 17 July 1898, created the National Social Protection Fund for Worker Disability and Old Age which later became the Instituto Nazionale della Previdenza Sociale (INPS) in 1933. The Act established the social protection system in Italy, In 2011, Italy's pension system changed from a wage-based system to a contribution-based system that is monitored by the INPS. These reforms were a result of the Monti cabinet's attempt to implement legislation regarding market liberalization at the request of the European Central Bank (ECB).  Employment terms  =Employment rights= Constitutional rights of employment are laid out in Italy's constitution. That document gives all citizens a right to work, to receive fair pay, dictates maximum hours, and guarantees paid vacations. Since 1987, the Italian Department of Labor limits the maximum hours to 48 hours a week. Workers must take one day off for every six days of work (weekly). Workers are entitled to national holidays and regular holidays. Workers who provide domestic services are eligible for a minimum of eight days of paid leave, and all other workers receive a minimum of three weeks. =Wages= Italy has no set minimum wage, but an employee's salary must be reflective of the quantity and quality of the work that they present. The salary must provide the employee and family with a living wage. The wage must relate to the average wage of those in the same industry.PLC - Employment and employee benefits in Italy: Overview. (n.d.). Retrieved December 3, 2016, from Italy has a wage guarantee fund. This fund, known as the Redundancy Fund (Cassa integrazione guadagni, CIG), managed by the INPS, is meant to help those whose hours who have been shortened or those on temporary suspension. =Employment protections= The Constitution protects women, minors, the elderly, the ill, the disabled and those hurt on the job. It protects those who strike and those who assemble. The minimum working age in statutory law is fifteen, but civil law varies. Paid sick leave is determined by employee-specific contracts, but sick leave can be extended with unpaid leave. All terminated employees receive severance pay. Severance is a part of the annual salary and is accrued. Severance pay is calculated by multiplying 7.5% of annual salary by the number of years worked. Additionally, the terminated employee receives 75% of the consumer price index increase. = Family policies = In Italy, women's unemployment is twice as high as men's. Women are protected when pregnant and receive maternity leave. From the start of pregnancy, to the year following childbirth, women's jobs are protected absent a significant reason. Women must take maternity leave two months prior to childbirth and return three months following childbirth. During this time the women are paid 80% of their daily salary. Italy gives family benefits in the form of money. Family benefits are increased for any family member who is handicapped. History The 2015 Jobs Act introduced controversial changes to labor law. Its aim is to reduce barriers to employment by making it easier to dismiss workers. Article 18 of the Workers Statute 1970 gives workers significant leverage because it requires employers with 15 or more workers to rehire permanent employees who were wrongfully dismissed. Because the article does not apply to companies with fewer than 15 workers or fixed-term employment, the theory is that it results in a labor market where employers are reluctant to hire employees when they approach the 15-employee threshold.

The council seat was located at Mount Pleasant. It was established on 1 May 1935 following the amalgamation of the District Council of Springton and District Council of Tungkillo with a section of the Hundred of Finniss from the District Council of Mannum and a section of the Hundred of Mobilong from the District Council of Mobilong. It had an area of approximately , comprising mainly \\"agricultural, grazing and vineyard lands\\", and included the whole of the cadastral Hundreds of Jutland and Tungkillo and parts of the Hundreds of Moorooroo, Talunga, Finniss and Mobilong. It was divided into five wards (Eden Valley, Springton, Mount Pleasant, Tungkillo and Palmer), each represented by one councillor. The council office was located in Main Street, Mount Pleasant; initially a converted residence, it was replaced with a purpose-built council chambers on the same site in 1954. The council's responsibilities over time included road construction, the opening of the Mount Pleasant Kindergarten in 1980 and the provision of the Talunga Village units for the elderly in conjunction with the Lions Club; it also redeveloped and owned Talunga Park as the Mount Pleasant Oval and Showgrounds. In 1986, the council district had an area of 633.4 square kilometres extending \\"from the Adelaide Hills to the Murray flats\\", with an estimated population of 1,800, a quarter residing in Mount Pleasant itself. The primary industries of the district were wool, oats and barley, dairying and viticulture, while secondary industry was largely limited to its role as service centre for the district. The council ceased to exist on 1 July 1997, when it was divided between the Barossa Council, which had been established in 1996, and the new Mid Murray Council. The north west portion spanning the Barossa Range and Mount Gould Range, including the townships of Mount Pleasant, Springton and Eden Valley portion went to the Barossa Council, while the larger remainder became the Palmer-Tungkillo Ward of the Mid Murray Council.

He is the principal in Fabrizio, Lee & Associates, and was the pollster for Donald Trump's fall 2016 Presidential campaign, former Senator Bob Dole's 1996 Presidential campaign, U.S. Senator Rand Paul's U.S. Senate and 2016 Presidential campaign, and former Governor Rick Perry's 2012 Presidential campaign, among others. He also served as a pollster for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in the 2014 midterm elections. Fabrizio is a silent owner of Multi Media Services Corporation (MMSC). MMSC was the biggest vendor to the top pro-Trump Rebuilding America Now super PAC. In February 2018, he was questioned by Robert Mueller's Special Counsel team about polling data shared with pro-Kremlin pro-Putin individuals. Career In 1996, Fabrizio served as chief pollster and strategist to Bob Dole's Presidential campaign, which was unsuccessful. He has also worked for several dozen U.S. Senators and Governors, including Tim Pawlenty, Rand Paul, Bill Cassidy, David Perdue, among others. During 2012 and 2013, he received $250,000 for his efforts to assist Paul Manafort's pro-Russia, pro-Kremlin, pro-Putin efforts in Ukraine. He was also pollster for the Republican Governor Association's campaign to reelect Governor Scott Walker in 2014. He also served as the pollster for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's independent campaign effort that helped elect six new Republican Senators and re-elect three Republican incumbents in 2014. In 2015, he served as pollster for successful gubernatorial candidate Matt Bevin in Kentucky, and that year also aided Rand Paul's Presidential campaign. Following Paul's exit from the race, Fabrizio was hired by the campaign of Donald Trump as Chief Pollster, joining fellow pollsters Kellyanne Conway and John McLaughlin (Fabrizio's former business partner). Fabrizio's hiring as Trump's pollster came as a surprise to political analysts, pointing to Trump's past opposition to pollsters, with Trump stating in an interview with Chuck Todd on Meet the Press, \\"I don't have pollsters. I don't want to waste money on pollsters. I don't want to be unreal. I want to be me. I have to be me.\\" He and Conway were among those representing the Trump campaign at Harvard University's post-election roundtable.\\"Roundtable Discussion: The General Election,\\" accessed thru http://iop.harvard.edu/get-inspired/campaign- managers-conference/campaign-president-managers-look-2016 Fabrizio is also longtime friends with former Trump advisers Paul Manafort and Roger Stone. In October 2016, it was reported in multiple media outlets that Trump was refusing to pay for Fabrizio's polling services, with the Federal Election Commission report showing that Trump's campaign was disputing nearly $767,000 that Fabrizio's firm said it was still owed for polling. Fabrizio has additionally worked with clients including Visa, Hewlett-Packard, Bank of America, AOL/Time-Warner, FedEx, Pfizer, and Harrah's, among others. Mueller's Special Counsel investigations In February 2018, Fabrizio was questioned by Robert Meuller's team to determine if voter information and polling data was shared with the Kremlin during the 2016 United States elections. On January 8, 2019, Paul Manafort's attorneys failed to redact and inadvertently revealed that Mueller's prosecutors knew that 2016 voter information and polling data had been shared with pro-Kremlin Ukrainians through Konstantin Kilimnik to Serhiy Lyovochkin and Rinat Akhmetov.

It is a genre of poetry in Old Gujarati language popular during early period of Gujarati literature. Sometimes the term is used interchangeably with Prabandha of medieval literature. History Rasa developed during the period of Gurjar Apbhramsa. It is a period between Hemachandra and Narsinh Mehta. They are mostly written by Jain monks and were performed in Jain temples on certain occasions. Early examples are Updeshrasayan Rasa (1143) by Jinadattasuri, Bharateshwar-Bahubali Raso (1184) by Shilabhadrasuri, Jeevdaya Raso (1200) by Asigu. Sandesa Rasak (15th century) by Abdul Rahman is one example of non-Jain composition. The literary tradition till 19th century. Gajsinh-Raja-no-Rasa (1851) is one late example. Form During its earliest form, it was a musical Roopaka (theatrical performance). Vagbhatta describes Rasaka as a soft and vigorous musical Roopaka with a variety of Tala (beat or measure) and Laya (rhythm). Rasaka was played by female dancers. The number of pairs participating can increase up to 64. There were two types of Rasas; Tala Rasa and Lakuta Rasa. In Tala Rasa the beats of time were matched by claps of hands while in Lakuta Rasa it was matched by clashing of wooden sticks in the hands of performers. So the Rasa was a type of literature intended to performed by pairs of females dancing and singing in a circle. Tala Rasas were mostly played by females while Lakuta Rasas were mostly played by males. The form is somewhat similar to Rasa dance played in Rasa lila. As the early Rasas were intended to be performed, they were not lengthy. But over the years, they became lengthy and narrative with elements of story. So the performance aspect may have been diminished. It is doubtful that the Rasas written in 17th and 18th centuries were actually performed. It is most likely that they were only recited. The Rasas were written in a variety of metres like Doha, Chaupai or Deshi. Rasas were divided into Khanda and different parts were called Bhasha, Thavani, Kadavaka. They had historical as well as mythological themes. Due to their basic composition meant to be didactic, the early Rasa like the Buddhi Rasa includes only words of advice. In late compositions of 16th to 18th century, they reads heavy and artificial due to incorporation of elements of narration, description, moral instructions and sectarian principles.

He was maestre de campo and interim governor of the Governorate of Paraguay from 1706 to 1707 and governor of the Governorate of the R√≠o de la Plata from 1715 to 1717. During his career, he campaigned against the indigenous Charrua, Yaro, and Boh√°n people; the Portuguese; and the comunero rebels of Paraguay. Biography Baltazar Garcia Ros was born around 1670 in Valtierra in Navarre.Mally, Pedro. p. 54 He enlisted in the army and participated in the Italian Wars.Alemparte 1966. He later left for the Viceroyalty of Peru in the Spanish Empire and arrived in Buenos Aires in 1701, where he was conferred the position of sargento mayor. Ros was a brave soldier who fought successful campaigns against the Aboriginal Charrua, Yaro, and Bohanes during this time. In 1705, with Juan de Lacoizqueta, Ros participated in the Siege of Colonia del Sacramento to take the town from the Portuguese, as part of the War of the Spanish Succession. The Portuguese eventually abandoned Colonia, giving victory to the Spanish. The victory was short-lived; the Treaty of Utrecht specified Colonia was to be handed back to the Portuguese, which happened in 1715. Still, the success earned Ros the title of maestre de campo. He was additionally granted interim governorship of Paraguay until a long-term replacement could arrive from Europe. After Manuel de Robles Lorenzana arrived to lead Paraguay, he returned to Buenos Aires where he served in the government there. Ros served as governor of the R√≠o de la Plata from 1715 to 1717. He continued on as Lieutenant Governor when Bruno Mauricio de Zabala arrived to take up the position.MCN Biograf√≠as. Baltazar Garc√≠a Ros In 1724, he was sent to end the governorship of Jos√© de Antequera y Castro of Paraguay with military force; Antequera was an official of the Real Audiencia of Charcas who had deposed the former governor and replaced him, an act which the Viceroy considered illegal. Ros's force, composed largely of mission Indians, was soundly defeated by a surprise attack from Antequera's Paraguayan militia. Ros was forced back in defeat. Antequera's victory was short-lived, though; Governor Zabala personally organized a larger force the next year, and Antequera fled Zabala's oncoming troops in 1725, ending the first phrase of what would later be known as the Revolt of the Comuneros of Paraguay.Lopez, p. 97-100 Ros died in Buenos Aires on September 18, 1740.

Any apprenticeship that is terminated less than 42 days after the start of the apprenticeship will not qualify for any payment. Initially, Levy-paying firms could only share 10% of their levy with other businesses.

Presently there is a Hindu temple and a Christian shrine at the two extreme hills.  Topography  Distant hills as seen from Panchalimedu view point Predominantly it is a high altitude region situated at a height of above the mean sea level. The place is surrounded by deep valleys and hills, accompanied by meadows, grasslands and cool refreshing climate. From there, the Koruthodu valley near Mundakkayam with widespread rubber plantations can be seen. Parunthumpara hills and Periyar tiger reserve lies to the east of Panchalimedu. Many tourists arrives there during the summer season for trekking and to get refreshed. When monsoon arrives, the place will be covered by charming mist and thick fog. Although, a pleasant climate is experienced here throughout the year. Apart from Pullumedu, Panchalimedu is another spot in the district where many pilgrims gather to witness the Makaravilakku, a holy flame that is believed to a supernatural phenomenon by the devotees, which appears annually on 14 January in the Ponnambalamedu summit.

Myths  Shivalinga with the shrine of Bhuvaneswari Devi at Panchalimedu According to the myths, Pandavas along with their spouse Panchali had a sojourn there at time of one-year exile. Hence the place got its name Panchalimedu which derived from the words \\"Panchali\\" (Draupadi) and \\"medu\\" (hill). The local tribes there offered selfless helps to the Kuru princes. Pandavas left the region before the beginning of one year incognito. They rewarded an idol of Goddess Durga to the tribal chief for their helps and instructed them to worship Devi. But, unexpected incidents occurred when the tribes worshipped Devi by following their own uncivilized puja methods. Hence the place became uninhabitable for them. Later, Devi herself moved to the present Valliyamkavu region and presided there. In light of this myth, people still believe that Panchalimedu is the moola sthana or sanctum sanctorum of Devi. Panchalikulam (the pond of Panchali), believed to be constructed by the Pandavas At present, there is a small temple dedicated to Goddess Bhuvaneswari, which can be approached by a walkway from the main road. The temple which hadn't daily poojas in the past is currently under the administration of Travancore Devaswom Board. The granite edicts found there depicts the linkage of the place to ancient history. Several Shiva lingas, Trishulas (trident) and NƒÅga idols are also placed near the shrine. A small circular pond known as Panchalikulam is situated there, in which Pandavas and Panchali took their daily bath. It is about in diameter. Even during hot summers, it will be filled by plenty of water. One cave also exist there named Pandavaguha (cave of Pandavas), in which the footprints of Bhima can be witnessed. Local folks still believe that it is the footprints of the mighty Bhima himself. 2019 controversy In 2019, the Church authorities installed two crosses on the hill. Meanwhile, a Hindu group installed a Trishula near the cross as a way of protesting the Church's alleged attempt to encroach upon revenue land. This caused controversy.The District Collector send a notice to church authorities to remove the crosses and soon it was removed.

At the end of the Edo period, Takashima Castle was home to the Suwa clan, daimy≈ç of Takashima Domain. The castle is also known as or  Situation  Plan of Takashima Castle Takashima Castle is originally built on a peninsula extending into Lake Suwa, with the lake itself forming part of its moats. This meant that only the side facing the shore had to have strong ramparts. The Main Bailey (Honmaru) [1] was connected to the Second Bailey (Ni-no-maru) [2] and Third Bailey (San-no-Maru) [3] by bridges, with the Main Bastion (Koromo-no- nami kuruwa ( Ë°£‰πãÊ≥¢Êõ≤Ëº™ )) [K] containing the Main Gate (≈åtemon) [A] facing the shore. During the Edo period, increasing sedimentation of Lake Suwa left the castle surrounded by land, and the site is now located the middle of the modern city of Suwa. Today, the area is a public park. Only the north and east side of the moat has been preserved. In 1970, some of the castle structures were reconstructed, but are not historically accurate. The castle was listed as one of the Continued Top 100 Japanese Castles in 2017.  History  The area around Lake Suwa had been under the control of the Suwa clan since at least the early Heian period; however, the Suwa were conquered in the Sengoku period by Takeda Shingen, who annexed the area to his territories. Takashima Castle was ruled by a succession of Takeda generals (beginning with Itagaki Nobukata) until the defeat and annihilation of the Takeda clan at the Battle of Nagashino in 1575. The area then came under the control of Oda Nobunaga, who assigned it to one of his generals, Kawajiri Hidetaka. After Nobunaga was assassinated in the Honn≈ç-ji incident,the territory came under the control of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who assigned Hineno Takayoshi as daimy≈ç of Suwa Domain. Hideno Takayoshi began a complete reconstruction of the castle, which was completed by his son, Hideno Yoshiakira. The Hineno were reassigned in 1601, and the domain was returned to the hands of the Suwa clan by Tokugawa Ieyasu. The Suwa remained in control of the castle until the Meiji restoration. Following the establishment of the Meiji government and the abolition of the han system, the remaining structures of the castle were dismantled in 1875, leaving only the stone foundations. A Shinto Shrine dedicated to the war dead was established within the grounds in 1900 and the area of the Second and Third Baileys was built over as a residential district. The present donjon, yagura and gates are all reconstructions, which were completed in 1970.  Literature  *Takada, T≈çru: Takashima-jo in: Miura, Masayuki (ed.): Shiro to Jinya. Tokoku-hen.

It was founded following the 1994 military coup d'√©tat by the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council (APRFC), which was led by Yahya Jammeh. Its current head is Ousman Sowe.  History  The National Intelligence Agency (NIA) was founded in 1995 by Decree no. 45 issued by the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council (AFPRC). The AFPRC had come to power under the leadership of Yahya Jammeh in a 1994 military coup. It was set up to replace the National Security Service of Dawda Jawara's government. Initially, its purpose was to combat threats from dissidents within the armed forces itself. However, its role was quickly expanded to meet both real and perceived challenges from civilian critics and opponents. Despite the transition to a civilian government in 1996, the original military decree was retained, allowing the NIA to operate outside the correct legal framework. The NIA also gained a \\"feared reputation for harassment of the political opposition and news media critics of the government\\". NIA operatives were accused of being involved in the alleged 21 March 2006 coup d'√©tat attempt against Jammeh's regime. On 31 January 2017, the newly elected President Adama Barrow announced that the name of the NIA would be changed to the State Intelligence Services (SIS). It was announced the next day that former NIA Deputy Director, Musa Dibba, was appointed as the new Director of the SIS.  Reports of torture  Many reports that NIA operatives used torture have been made. A former NIA operative, who spoke to Human Rights Watch on the condition of anonymity, said that \\"I‚Äôd seen bad things before, but suddenly I was seeing real torture. One woman was beaten so badly she wet herself in fear. I can still remember her screams.\\" He said that during his time at the NIA, he witnessed arbitrary arrests, torture, and enforced disappearances. In 2016, NIA operatives detained Solo Sandeng, a Gambian political activist, and beat him to death in custody. Nine members of the agency, including its former head, were put on trial the following year for Sandeng's death after his remains, among others, were discovered. The NIA reportedly maintained a small jail inside its headquarters, known as the bambadinka (crocodile hole), where dissidents were tortured.

It was commissioned by the knight Christoph von Zellking and is estimated as finished in 1497. The richly decorated wooden altarpiece depicts the saints Peter, Wolfgang and Christopher in its central section. The side panels depict scenes from the life of Mary, and the altarpiece also has an intricate superstructure and two side figures showing saints George and Florian. The identity of its maker is unknown, but at least two skilled sculptors appear to have created the main statuary of the altarpiece. Throughout the centuries, the altarpiece has been altered and lost its original paint and gilding. A major restoration was made in the 19th century under the leadership of writer Adalbert Stifter. The altarpiece has been described as \\"one of the greatest achievements in late-medieval sculpture in the German-speaking area.\\" History , in the outskirts of Kefermarkt, was the residence of Christoph von Zellking who commissioned the altarpiece. =Commission and creation= Christoph von Zellking, lord of nearby and adviser to Emperor Frederick III, commissioned the building of a new church for Kefermarkt between 1470 and 1476. In his last will and testament from 1490 he provided the money to pay, in installments, for an altarpiece dedicated to Saint Wolfgang also after his death. When the will was written, the altarpiece must already have been commissioned, and work on it may already have been started. In the following year, Christoph von Zellking died, and was buried in the choir of the church. While the altarpiece in Kefermarkt does not carry any inscriptions or other hints as to its origins, several circumstances indicate that it remains the altarpiece commissioned by Christoph von Zellking. A receipt from 1497 (later lost) documented the final payment for the altarpiece, indicating that the altarpiece may have been installed in the church that year. A rood cross from the church in Kefermarkt also bears the date 1497, indicating that the church would have been finished by then and the furnishings installed. The church in Kefermarkt, where the altarpiece is located. The altarpiece was made by a main sculptor, who is often referred to by a notname as the Master of the Kefermarkt Altarpiece. It has been assumed that he was the head of a workshop, which together with its main sculptor made two of the figures in the central section (Saint Wolfgang and Saint Peter), the reliefs on the wings, and most of the smaller statuary. The architectural elements and the superstructure may have been made by a cabinet maker's workshop. The identity of the main sculptor and the location of the workshop has been discussed for a long time. Because of its unusual quality, it has unconvincingly been proposed that the altarpiece was made by Tilman Riemenschneider, Veit Stoss, Michael Pacher and Albrecht D√ºrer. Most scholars have concluded that the workshop which produced the altarpiece was active in Passau, but since few comparable works of art from Passau have been preserved, no definitive conclusions have been drawn. Similarly, it has been proposed that one Martin Kriechbaum would be the Master of the Kefermarkt Altarpiece. He is mentioned in archival records as \\"painter\\", but this doesn't necessarily mean that he was not also skilled in woodcarving, and it is known that he had commissions in both Upper and Lower Austria. =Changes= Following the Reformation, the Zellking family became Protestant in 1558, and the Catholic church was subsequently neglected. In 1629, the church was closed altogether, and re-opened only in 1667 after being taken over by Jesuits during the Counter-Reformation. The church was restored in 1670 and at this time it appears that the altarpiece was altered, with changes made to make it more in line with the prevalent Baroque taste. The wings could originally be closed, but were now fixed to the central section. The superstructure was enlarged and enriched with other Gothic sculptures, taken from side altars. The two large statues not standing on wall consoles next to the altarpiece were placed on top of the wings. The altarpiece was originally partially gilded and painted, but today only fragments remain of the polychromy. In the late 18th century, the entire altarpiece was covered with whitewash to better suit the taste and ideals of the day. Similarly whitewashed Gothic altarpieces are known also from Niederrotweil and Moosburg. =Restoration= In the first half of the 19th century, the altarpiece was suffering damage from common furniture beetles. In 1852 the pastor approached the governor of Upper Austria and asked for help with restoring it. The question engaged the local government, who viewed the altarpiece as a \\"national monument\\" and its restoration as a matter of honour. The work was led by the writer Adalbert Stifter, who was also an art conservator. Restoration works were carried out between 1852 and 1855. Apart from Stifter, the team of restorers included sculptors and as well as several hired workers. The restoration is well-documented and it is clear that strove to preserve and restore the altarpiece to their best abilities. However, the far-reaching renovation has been criticised, not least because the complete removal of the remaining medieval polychromy. Probably, Stifter assumed that the fragments of medieval paint under the Baroque whitewash had also been applied during the Baroque period. During the renovation, large parts of the superstructure had to bee replaced as it had been too heavily infected by beetles. Adalbert Stifter also provided a description of the altarpiece in his novel Der Nachsommer. In 1929, a new attempt was made to get rid of furniture beetles damaging the altarpiece. Description The Kefermarkt altarpiece has been called \\"one of the greatest achievements in late-medieval sculpture in the German-speaking area.\\" The altarpiece is high from the floor to the top of the superstructure and wide. It is made of linden wood (with a few details made of larch added in the 19th century) and consists of four distinct parts: a predella at the base, a rectangular central section in the form of a shallow cabinet, two wings, and an intricate superstructure. Not integrated into the structure itself but part of the altarpiece ensemble are also two figures depicting Saint George and Saint Florian, today placed on consoles on either side of the altarpiece. =Central section= The central section of the altarpiece The central section is divided into three shallow niches each holding a slightly larger than life statue of the saints Peter, Wolfgang and Christopher. They are supported by richly carved corbels and crowned by baldachins. Saint Wolfgang, the patron saint of the church, occupies the middle niche and is also slightly larger than the other saints. Peter stands on Saint Wolfgang's right hand side and Saint Christopher on his left. Saint Christopher was the personal patron saint of Christoph von Zellking, hence the prominent location of the saint in the altarpiece. The statue of Saint Christopher appears to have been made by one artist, while the statues of Saint Peter and Wolfgang, as well as the side panels, by another. Especially the statue of Saint Christopher has been praised for its gaunt, expressive yet sensitive face, while the other sculptures have been described as more rigid in their expressions, and the drapery of their clothing executed with less skill and finesse. Unusually, Saint Christopher is not depicted as a strong giant, which was the medieval tradition, but as a young man. His head \\"betrays a sensitivity found only in the greatest works of Late Gothic sculpture\\". The sculpture of Saint Wolfgang is the largest of the three, tall. The saint is depicted in a full bishop's attire, dressed in a cope and holding a crozier. At his feet is a model church with an axe attached to its roof, one of the attributes of the saint. His facial features \\"show him to be a man of considerable energy and drive\\", according to art historian Rainer Kahsnitz. Saint Peter, tall, is even more richly dressed than Saint Wolfgang. His decorated brocade cope almost completely envelop the saint. His gloved hands hold the key to heaven, his attribute, and a book. Between the folds of his dress, a papal ferula is lodged against his left shoulder. Saint Christopher, lastly, is depicted as a young man carrying Christ on his shoulders. The statue measures . He is bare-headed and barefoot. He supports himself with a rough branch as he carries Christ across a river, and the wind ruffles his clothing. At the side of the central section, two smaller statues depicting Saint Stephen and Saint Lawrence are placed facing inwards. Both are tall and depict the saints rather traditionally in liturgical dress. =Wings= Apart from Saint Wolfgang, the main saint of the altarpiece is Mary. A statue of her is prominently placed in the middle of the superstructure, above the central panel. Furthermore, two wings each display a pair of wooden reliefs with scenes from the life of Mary. The wings could originally be closed by are now fixed. Originally, the outsides may have been painted with scenes from the life of Saint Wolfgang. The wing on the right side of the saints shows in its upper panel the Annunciation, and in its lower panel the Adoration of the Magi. The other wing shows the birth of Christ above, and the death of Mary in the lower panel. The figure of Mary is portrayed in a similar way in all the panels. In the annunciation scene, Mary is portrayed kneeling in a praying stool inside a half-open structure, supported by unusually carved pillars, crowned above their capitals with figures which are probably intended to be prophets from the Old Testament. The archangel Gabriel is entering the structure, and holds a speech scroll where parts of his greeting, the Ave Maria, is visible. In the upper left corner, a depiction of God the Father among clouds and flanked by two angels, can be seen. Originally the panel also contained a dove, symbol of the Holy Spirit, but it has been lost. On the opposite side, in the top section of the wing on the saints' left side, the birth of Christ is depicted. Mary is portrayed kneeling in devotion in front of Christ, who is placed before her on a fold of her dress. On the other side, Joseph is also kneeling in front of the child. Above Mary, on the roof of the building behind them, are two angels playing a mandolin and a lute. In the background, the annunciation to the shepherds can be seen. Chronologically following this scene is the panel below the annunciation scene. Here the subject of the adoration of the Magi is depicted. Mary gazes on the infant Christ while one of the Magi is kneeling in front of him; the child plays with the gold in the box he is bringing. Both he and the second Magi, behind him, have taken off their hats as signs of respect. The last panel depicts the death of Mary. She is peacefully lying in her deathbed, while a diminutive angel holds the curtain apart so that the viewer can see Mary better. The twelve apostles are all present, each one depicted with individual traits. Above the head of Saint Peter, Christ appears in a cloud, receiving the soul of his mother in the form of a small figure.

The carefully made sculptures are individually designed, with great variation in clothing and attributes. The superstructure itself consists of eleven pinnacles, with three main pinnacles towering over each of the saints in the central panel. It has been altered on several occasions and incorporates elements from other altarpieces. Originally, it was purely architectural in its composition, with no botanical elements. It is also questionable whether the figures were originally part of the superstructures, or if they were arranged in a different way.

When the evacuations did not go as planned, her mother mentioned Turkish Foreign Minister Mevl√ºt √áavu≈üoƒülu for making the ceasefire work, and the Foreign Minister said that they were doing all they could to get her and others out. On 19 December 2016, it was reported that Bana Alabed was among the 350 people who were evacuated from the former rebel-held districts of Aleppo on that day after its capture by government forces. After evacuating Aleppo, Bana was interviewed by Hadi Al Abdullah, where she clarifies that her father was injured in the Sukari district when their house was bombed. On 21 December, Bana and her family were officially allowed to live in Turkey, and met President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan in front of international press. On 7 April 2017, the twitter account tweeted in support of the Shayrat missile strike ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump as a reaction to the chemical weapons attack three days before. On 12 May 2017, Bana and her family were granted Turkish citizenship by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan. In October 2017, Bana visited New York. At the Headquarters of the United Nations she appeared in a recorded a Twitter message. Simon and Schuster has published her memoir, entitled Dear World. In 2018, Bana was honoured with the Rising Star Award at The Asian Awards. Criticism Her account has been subject to criticism from vocal opponents, including the setting up of accounts to publicly criticize the account in question. The Twitter account drew a great number of trolls and voices sympathetic to the Syrian government and its Russian backers, who assailed Bana as a fraud. Some called Bana and her mother fictions created by the United States as a propaganda tool to malign the Syrian and Russian governments. A journalist for The New Yorker noted that her \\"video statements often have a scripted quality, as if she is being coached by her mother to communicate her thoughts in a language that she is only beginning to learn.\\"https://streamable.com/s/clwcl/lrxqgb In a now deleted tweet, the account tweeted it is \\"better to start 3rd world war instead of letting Russia & assad commit #HolocaustAleppo\\".

In his first three seasons he was trained by John Gosden and showed useful form, winning three minor races but appearing to be some way short of top class. After being sold and transferred to the stable of Robert Cowell he showed improved form, winning the sprint race at the 2010 Shergar Cup and winning a strongly contested edition of the Scarbrough Stakes. He reached his peak as a six-year-old in 2011 when he won a handicap race in Dubai, the Group One King's Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot and the Prix du Petit Couvert in France as well as running prominently in several other major sprints including the Prix de Saint-Georges, Temple Stakes, Prix du Gros Ch√™ne and Nunthorpe Stakes. He remained in training for three more seasons but never won again and was retired in 2014 with a record of nine wins from fifty-nine starts. Background Prohibit is a bay horse with a white star and muzzle bred in England by his owner Khalid Abdullah's Juddmonte Farms. He was initially sent into training with John Gosden at Newmarket, Suffolk. He was from the first crop of foals sired by Oasis Dream, a sprinter who won the July Cup and the Nunthorpe Stakes in 2003 before becoming a very successful breeding stallion. His other progeny have included Midday, Muhaarar Jwala and Power. Prohibit's dam Well Warned won one minor race at Haydock Park in 1996 from nine starts. She was a great-granddaughter of the influential British broodmare Mofida, the female-line ancestor of Zafonic, Reams of Verse and Elmaamul. Racing career =2007-2009: early career= The racing colours of Khalid Abdullah, who bred Prohibit and owned him until October 2009 Prohibit began his racing career in September 2007 when he finished second over seven furlongs at Kempton Park Racecourse and sixth in a maiden race over the same distance at Lingfield Park. At Nottingham Racecourse on 3 October he started at odds of 7/2 in a fourteen-runner field and won by one and a quarter lengths from the Clive Brittain-trained Mansii. Prohibit began his second season by carrying 125 pounds to victory in a handicap race over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse in April and then finished third in the Listed Pavilion Stakes at Ascot Racecourse two weeks later. In May he finished third when favourite for a handicap at Newmarket before running fifth in the Sandy Lane Stakes at Haydock and then finished unplaced in a handicap at York Racecourse in June. After a four-month break he returned for a race over six furlongs on the synthetic Polytrack surface at Chelmsford City Racecourse and won by three quarters of a length at odds of 12/1. He ended his season by finishing seventh in the Listed Golden Rose Stakes at Lingfield in November. In 2009, Prohibit was entered in more prestigious sprint contests but failed to win a race. He finished sixth in the Abernant Stakes on his debut and then finished unplaced under 136 pouds in a valuable handicap at Newmarket. In the summer he finished fifth in the Wokingham Stakes at Royal Ascot and ran unplaced in the Stewards' Cup at Glorious Goodwood. On his final run of the year he was beaten a short head by Hitchens in a handicap at Haydock in September. In October 2009 Prohibit was offered for sale at Tattersalls and was bought for 85,000 guineas by the racehorse trainer Robert Cowell. The gelding entered the ownership of a partnership including Khalifa Dasmal, Allen Rix, Frank Barr, Thomas Morley and Janet Penney and was trained for the rest of his racing career by Cowell at Six Mile Bottom near Newmarket. =2010: five-year-old season= In early 2009 Prohibit was campaigned in Dubai where he finished unplaced in three starts at Meydan Racecourse. On his return to Europe he won a minor race over six furlongs at Kempton on 27 March, beating Elnawin by half a length at odds of 6/1. In May he ran unplaced in a handicap at Newmarket and was then sent to Sweden where he finished fourth in a Listed sprint race at J√§gersro. On returning to England he reverted to handicap company and finished unplaced in the Wokingham Stakes, second at Windsor, third and fourth in races at Ascot and third in the Stewards' Cup. On 7 August was selected to run in the Shergar Cup, an International jockeys' competition in which he represented the Europe team as the mount of Christophe Soumillon in the \\"Dash\\". Carrying top weight of 138 pounds he took the lead inside the final furlong and won \\"comfortably\\" by a length from Golden Destiny. Three weeks later he started favourite for the Listed Beverley Bullet but was beaten a short head by the Mick Channon-trained Master Hughie. On 8 September Prohibit started at odds of 9/2 in the Listed Scarbrough Stakes over five furlonga at Doncaster Racecourse in which he was ridden by Jamie Spencer. The best of his eight opponents appeared to be Group Therapy (runner-up to Borderlescott in the King George Stakes), Rose Blossom (winner of the Summer Stakes), Look Busy (Temple Stakes) and Captain Dunne (Epsom Dash). After tracking the leaders he accelerated inside the final furlong and won by three quarters of a length from the front-running Rose Blossom with Group Therapy in third. Ten days later he was moved up to Group Three class for the World Trophy at Newbury Racecourse and finished third to Astrophysical Jet and Golden Destiny. On 3 October he was sent to France and stepped up to Group One level for the Prix de l'Abbaye over 1000 metres in which he was ridden by Frankie Dettori and finished sixth of the twenty-one runners behind the upset winner Gilt Edge Girl. =2011: six-year-old season= Spring As in 2011, Prohibit began his season in Dubai where he ran four times at Meydan in early spring. After finishing eighth in Group Three race on 3 February he contested a valuable handicap race a week later over five furlongs and won by a short head from the Irish-trained Invincible Ash. He ran fourth when favourite for a conditions races on 3 March and then finished fifth behind the South African sprinter J J the Jet Plane in the Al Quoz Sprint on Dubai World Cup Night. On his return to Europe Prohibit was campaigned exclusively in Group races. He finished ninth to Tangerine Trees in a blanket finish to the Palace House Stakes on 30 April and then ran fourth to Inxile in a five-way photo-finish for the Prix de Saint-Georges at Longchamp on 15 May. Six days later he finished third to Sole Power and Kingsgate Native in the Temple Stakes at Haydock with Borderlescott, Group Therapy, Rose Blossom, Overdose, Tangerine Trees and Markab among the other beaten runners. At Chantilly Racecourse on 5 June he was again narrowly defeated in a strong field when he was beaten a head by the three-year-old filly Wizz Kid in the Prix du Gros Ch√™ne with Inxile in third and the Prix de l'Abbaye winners Total Gallery and Marchand d'Or in sixth and seventh. Summer Ascot Racecourse: the site of Prohibit's win in the King's Stand Stakes In the King's Stand Stakes at Royal Ascot on 14 June Prohibit was ridden by Jim Crowley and started the 7/1 fourth choice in the betting behind Kingsgate Native, the Australian challenger Star Witness (Blue Diamond Stakes) and Sole Power. The other fifteen runners included Bridgetown (Summer Stakes) and Holiday for Kitten from the United States, Sweet Sanette from Hong Kong, War Artist (Goldene Peitsche) from Germany, Mar Ardentro from France, Arctic (Round Tower Stakes) from Ireland and Overdose from Hungary as well as Tangerine Trees, Rose Blossom, Astrophysical Jet, Iver Bridge Lad (Dragon Stakes) and Monsieur Chevalier (Molecomb Stakes) from the United Kingdom. Prohibit was restrained behind the leaders as Rose Blossom set the pace but began to make progress two furlongs out, at which point Sweet Sanette went to the front. Prohibit maintained his run, overtook the Hong Kong mare in the closing stages and held off the late run of Star Witness to win by half a length. Sweet Sanette took third ahead of Overdose, with a gap of two and a half lengths back to War Artist in fifth. After the race Cowell said \\"I'm overwhelmed. I've got sunglasses on, so you won't notice I'm crying. I've had a bit of flak for running him too much, but he thrives on his racing. He's a game horse and I'm chuffed to bits. It's the best day of my racing life ‚Äì it's awesome. Over five furlongs he's obviously a very talented horse, but he doesn't get a yard further.\\" Jim Crowley, who was riding his first Royal Ascot winner commented \\"He travelled well and I hardly had to use my stick ‚Äì he picked up by himself. He's run four times in a few weeks and loves his racing. He's thriving, improving on it. He broke really well and was a different horse today. I was a little concerned when the rain came as he prefers faster ground, but it's perfect the way it is\\". In August Prohibit started at odds of 12/1 in the Nunthorpe Stakes on softer ground at York Racecourse. The fifteen runners split into groups on either side of course and although Prohibit finished first among the horses on the far-side (the left-hand side from the jockey's viewpoint) he was beaten into third by the outsiders Margot Did and Hamish McGonagall who raced up the opposite side of the course. Autumn The Prix du Petit Couvert over 1000 metres at Longchamp on 11 September saw a rematch between Prohibit (carrying a seven-pound weight penalty as a Group One winner) and Hamish McGonagall with Mar Ardentro and War Artist also in the field along with the improving handicapper Spectacle du Mars. Starting at odds of 4.5/1 he tracked the leaders as Hamish McGonagall set the pace before giving way to Mar Ardentro at half distance. Prohibit stayed on strongly, survived a bump with Mar Ardentro in the closing stages and prevailed in the final strides to win by a head. Soumillon on the runner-up lodged an objection, but after an inquiry by the racecourse stewards the result remained unaltered. Jim Crowley said \\"I was surprised there was an inquiry, because when you look at the head-on, it's Soumillon's horse that comes off the rail. It was a good performance carrying that weight... he's obviously getting quicker.\\" On 2 October was made the 4/1 second favourite in his second attempt to win the Prix de l'Abbaye, but after being hampered and losing his position at half way he finished seventh of the fifteen runner behind Tangerine Trees. =2012-2014: later career= Prohibit was back at Meydan in early 2012 but failed to win or place in three starts. He returned to Europe but made only three further appearances that year starting with a seventh-place finish behind Wizz Kid in the Prix du Gros Ch√™ne at Chantilly on 3 June. Later that month he attempted to repeat his 2011 success in the King's Stand Stakes but started a 25/1 outsider and ran accordingly, finishing fifteenth of the twenty-two runners behind the Hong Kong challenger Little Bridge. In July he finished fourth behind his old rival Hamish McGonagall in the Listed City Walls Stakes at York. After an eleven-month absence, Prohibit returned to the track in 2013 to finish fifth in a Listed race at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse but made no in seven subsequent races that year. He finished fifteenth in his third King's Stand Stakes, last in a handicap at Ascot and third in a minor race at Nottingham Racecourse in August. He finished last in handicaps at Haydock and Yarmouth in September, fourth in a small race at Kempton in November and last of ten on the Polytrack at Lingfield in December. In January 2014 he ran twice on the synthetic track at Southwell Racecourse, finishing sixth and ninth in minor events before sustaining a knee injury. Cowell announced in February that the gelding would not race again and had been retired to the trainer's Bottisham Heath Stud. In 2016 Cowell reported on his website that Prohibit had made a good recovery from his injury and would be used as a hack by members of the Cowell family. Assessment and awards In his best year, 2011, Prohibit was given a rating of 116 in the World Thoroughbred Rankings, making him the 190th best horse in the world and the sixth-best horse in Europe over sprint distances.

Chaforce was an ad hoc Australian infantry force formed during the Kokoda Track Campaign of the Pacific War, World War II. It was nominally of battalion size but consisting of only three rifle companies and a headquarters element, it was therefore proportionally smaller, with an initial strength of 407 all ranks. After withdrawal of the 21st Brigade from fighting along the Kokoda Track, Brigadier Arnold Potts proposed that a special force be raised to conduct a long range penetration and harassment of the Japanese line of communication between Wairopi and Buna‚ÄìGona. The force was raised with each battalion of the 21st Brigade (2/14th Infantry Battalion, 2/16th Infantry Battalion and 2/27th Infantry Battalion) contributing a rifle company drawn from the fittest of those recently withdrawn from the fighting, having been relieved by the 25th Brigade as the Australian forces withdrew to Imita Ridge following the Battle of Ioribaiwa. The force was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Hugh Challen and named for this officer. Challen had been brigade major of the 21st Brigade and had been appointed to command the 2/14th Battalion after Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Key had been killed in action. The plan called for the force to move forward to Myola, where it would cross into the head-waters of the Kumusi River, whence it would traverse the valley toward Wairopi. The plan was approved by New Guinea Force on 7 October 1942 but approval was subsequently rescinded due to a lack of aerial reconnaissance and concerns about the fitness of the force, even though the force had arrived at Myola on 18 October and an advance patrol from there had already deployed. Major General Arthur Allen proposed employing the force to conduct a less ambitious close flanking mission but this too was vetoed on 24 October. When the proposed independent mission had been definitely cancelled, Challen was recalled to command the 2/14th Battalion. The Chaforce companies were mainly employed as work parties in support of the 16th Brigade as it advanced on Kokoda. Author, Raymond Paull, notes significant disaffection in the ranks as a result that they were considered fit for these duties but not for the fighting for which they had volunteered. Major General George Vasey, had replaced Allen in command of the 7th Division. He decided that Chaforce should reinforce the depleted battalions of the 25th Brigade for the advance on Gona. Each of the force's rifle companies was attached to a battalion of the brigade. The force was to never engage the Japanese as a unit. The 21st Brigade reinforced the 25th Brigade in front of Gona. The Chaforce companies rejoined their parent units when the 25th Brigade was withdrawn from the fighting.

It is located near in the market municipality of H√∂sbach in the district of Aschaffenburg in the south German state of Bavaria.  History  The castle was probably built in the mid-13th century on and next to a fort of the La T√®ne period, probably later than the castle on nearby . By 1261 the castle had been destroyed during a conflict between the Rieneck counts and Electoral Mainz. In the 18th century the castle was used as a quarry and demolished apart from a few wall remains.  Description  The castle had a sturdy enceinte, which enclosed the entire site and guaranteed protection for its occupants. The roughly 2-metre-thick and probably over ten-metre-high shield wall with its wooden wall walk and tiled roof was integrated into the early mediaeval enceinte. The buildings in the castle courtyard were made of stone and wood. From the then treeless summit, the Aschaff valley could be overlooked. In 1904, the Aschaffenburg chemist, Deinlein, carried out the first excavations on the Gr√§fenberg. Today there are the wall foundations of a rectangular building, a five-metre-long and 1.8-metre-side longitudinal wall, a four-metre-long and 0.4-metre-wide transverse wall which abuts on another wall that has yet to be uncovered. Also recognisable are elements of a vaulted ceiling and a circular wall that could be a cistern or a dungeon.Der Gr√§fenberg ‚Äì Forschungsgeschichte bei spessartprojekt.de  Literature  * Bj√∂rn-Uwe Abels: Die vor- und fr√ºhgeschichtlichen Gel√§ndedenkm√§ler Unterfrankens.

During Bosnian War, the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) attacked Bosniak cities and villages in eastern Bosnia, as part of its \\"six strategic goals\\" of \\"eliminating the Drina river as a border\\" between Serbia and Bosnian Serbs. Although the Serb forces took control of Zvornik, Bratunac, and Vlasenica municipalities during the first half of 1992, pockets in the surrounding area remained outside of their reach, with Bosniaks offering resistance.Prosecutor v. Karad≈æiƒá ‚Äì Judgement, 24 March 2016, p. 2031 The Serb forces started the siege of Srebrenica. Between April 1992 and March 1993, the Srebrenica areas were constantly subjected to Serb military assaults, including artillery attacks, sniper fire, as well as occasional bombing from aircraft.Prosecutor v. Oriƒá ‚Äì Judgement, 30 June 2006, pp. 38-39. The Bosnian Serb forces controlled the access roads and forbade international humanitarian aid to reach the Srebrenica enclave, not even allowing food and medicine as relief. As a consequence, there was a constant shortage of food. This starvation peaked in the winter of 1992/93. In order to overcome this shortage, the Bosniaks occasionally stormed nearby Serb villages in search for food, often risking dying or being wounded from land mines or Serb fire.Prosecutor v. Oriƒá ‚Äì Judgement, 30 June 2006, p. 42 On 16 January 1993 soldiers of the Bosnian army, led allegedly by Naser Oriƒá, attacked the village of Skelani. Dozens of Serbs were killed in the attack. According to Serb sources, around a hundred Serbs were wounded, while 30 people were taken prisoners and beaten. The Bosniak forces almost reached the border with Serbia, but were stopped a kilometer within Skelani due to an intervention by the Yugoslav Army and Territorial Defense units from the U≈æice Corps. The Bosniak forces came so close that some were even machine-gunning Serb civilians fleeing across the border to Bajina Ba≈°ta, Serbia.  Memorial  In the village of Skelani in 2005 erected a monument for 305 Serbian civilians who were killed during the war (1992‚Äì1995).

Matthi Forrer, R. G. Sawers Publishers, 1982, p. 8 Hillier became interested in Japanese ukiyo-e art in the 1940s, when it was at a low ebb in terms of interest from the West. He collected Japanese prints, books, and paintings. He taught himself to draw and make prints, and in 1951 had Old Surrey Watermills published, with his own illustrations. Hillier went on to become a leading European ukiyo-e scholar. He assisted in the formation of several collections, and catalogued collections by those such as Henri Vever. He was cataloguer for Japanese prints at Sotheby's for 25 years. Hillier had his first book on ukiyo-e, Japanese Masters of the Colour Print, published by Phaidon Press in 1954. He followed with the monographs Hokusai in 1955, Utamaro in 1961, and Hokusai Drawings in 1966. Later books include The Uninhibited Brush (1974), about the Shij≈ç school of painting; The Art of Hokusai in Book Illustration (1980); and The Art of the Japanese Book (1987).

In the years immediately preceding the start of World War I, several new models of khaki-grey uniform jackets were adopted in Russia for service wear by Imperial Army officers. In most cases these were related to (and influenced by) the latest creations in the armies of France and the United Kingdom. These loose-fitting and practical garments received the collective designation french in tribute to the supreme commander of the British Expeditionary Force to France, field marshal John French. The main features of the french were as follows: * soft collar ‚Äì turndown version or standing version with button fastening, * variable half-belt and changeable sleeves * four big pockets (appliqu√©d, with buttons) with flaps (two upper chest, two below). In the Red Army of the Soviet Union it was usually worn by commanding officers, chiefs and political officers and from 1924 to 1943. In the air force there was a limited number of frenches regularly worn by British officers. It was characterised by an open collar, to be worn with tie or scarf.

The students, all in their twenties, were Mohammad Chong from Beijing, Osman Chau from Anhwei, Idris Wong and Ibrahim Ma, both from Shandong. While Chong previously studied at an Islamic school in the capital, the rest were students of Nanjing University. In the year 1990, Osman Chau translated the Quran in Mandarin Chinese. By 2011, there were approximately 60 Ahmadi Muslim refugees living on the outskirts of Beijing. In particular, 34 Ahmadi Muslim refugees were residing in Yanjiao, east of Beijing; whilst in Langfang, south of the capital, there were about 20 Ahmadi Muslim refugees. The Ahmadis constituted the largest share of all refugees in North China. In April 2012, the head of the Ahmadiyya movement of Israel, Muhammad Sharif Odeh visited Yinchuan, the provincial capital of Ningxia. Odeh held a meeting with Li Rui, the vice chairman of the autonomous province, taking the opportunity to introduce the peaceful and humanitarian activities of the Ahmadiyya movement around the world.

Founder president of Indian Language Society in the early 1980s at IIT/K, he served several organizations in various honorary capacities: Mahendralal Sircar Research Professor in History of Science at the Asiatic Society, Kolkata (1995‚Äì2001); the AICTE Emeritus Fellow at the Jadavpur University (2001‚Äì2004); and INSA Research Fellow in Kolkata. He was a member of the INSA National Commission for History of Science and, the editorial board member of the Indian Journal of the History of Science.Obituary  Early years and education  After his initial studies at Saint Xaviers College (1948‚Äì52), he went on to Science College (1952‚Äì59) (both in Calcutta) to complete his Master and Doctorate degrees in Applied Chemistry. He submitted his doctoral thesis (1959) on surface-active agents from glycerides and their fascinating micellar world in aqueous solutions. Inspired by the advice of his mentor, Dr. K.K. Majumdar (who later became the founding President of the Indian Institute of Mineral Engineers (IIME)), Biswas took up mineral engineering as one of the goals of his professional career and the study of the challenging subject of froth flotation which involved the investigations related to surface science, one of his passions. In his own words,Mineral Engineering in India ‚Äì Reflections, Indian Institute of Mineral Engineers, 2012 ‚Äò... (he) contacted Professor AM Gaudin of MIT and was warmly invited ... and then opened before him the glamorous world of MIT education in several fields: mineralogy and crystallography (William Dennen and Martin Burger), optical mineralogy (GE Agar), mineral engineering (AM Gaudin), physical chemistry of surfaces (PL de Bruyn and Alan Michaels)MIT President Report 1962 and even archaeometallurgy (the famous CS Smith) and history of science and civilization (guess who, Aldous Huxley who was a Visiting Professor during the Centenary year of 1961)!‚Äô He went to MIT as a Fulbright Fellow. At MIT (1960‚Äì63), he worked on hysteresis of contact angle under the guidance of Professor Antoine Marc Gaudin.Gaudin, A.M., Witt, A.F., and Biswas, A.K.: Hysteresis of Contact Angles in the System Organic Liquid-Water-Rutile, Trans., SME (March 1964) 1‚Äì5 Learning at MIT was not confined to science of mineral processing; he continued with his interest in music, which he developed in early fifties, and simultaneously attended a course in Music Department on 'Music Appreciation'.'Science and Music with a Special Note on Helmholtz, James Jeans to Pandit Ravi Shankar' in Science and Culture, vol 7‚Äì8, 2013, p. 299  IIT Kanpur era (1963‚Äì95)  Professor Biswas returned to India in 1963 and joined Department of Metallurgical Engineering (now Materials and Metallurgical Engineering) at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. He was the founding members of the Department where he served as a faculty member during (1963‚Äì95). = Contributions to mineral processing = The essence of his early years at IIT Kanpur can be gauged from his personal recollection, 'During the period 1964‚Äì1970, Biswas was extremely busy in organising the mineral engineering programme at IIT Kanpur in collaboration with his esteemed colleagues: TC Rao who had worked with Professor AJ Lynch in Australia, A Ghosh who had worked with Professor TB King at MIT, and the two geologist colleagues: KVGK Gokhale who wrote a book on mineral resources in India, co-authored by TC Rao, and BC Ray Mahasay the renowned geochemist from the Harvard University. Professor Gerhard Derge had gone back to USA, but he kept on sending valuable advice to Biswas on the subject of mineral engineering ... 1968 ..., A K Biswas planned a Short Course on 'Mineral Engineering Practice' to be held at IIT Kanpur on 27 and 28 February 1969, to be followed by a Seminar on \\"Mineral Engineering Education\\" scheduled on 1 March ... An invitation was sent to Professor AM Gaudin through the KIAP (unfortunately the visit did not take place) .... Professor Gaudin's love for antiquity was very deep and infectious, imbibed by many of his students, including AK Biswas'. In 1969, he published his first book, Science in India (Firma KLM, Kolkata). Along with Dr. KK Majumdar, head of ore dressing section at BARC and several other stalwarts working in the area of mineral processing, he played a very active role in the setting up of Indian Institute of Mineral Engineers (IIME) which was registered as a Society on 12 November 1969. On his association with IIME, in 2012, he observed, 'I was proud (and still am) to become the first Life Member of the proposed institute'. During his distinguished career of 32 years (1963‚Äì94) at IIT/K, Biswas developed and taught several courses related to mineral processing. He established the Materials Separation and Surface Chemistry laboratories. Biswas enjoyed the reputation of a dedicated teacher and was popular among students. Industrial perspective was a hallmark of his teaching. Starting from his early career, he used to visit mineral based industry/institutes almost every summer. Besides teaching, he guided many students in their research at Doctoral, Masters and Bachelors levels. Many of them are well-established professionals now in India and abroad. Biswas believed that both basic and applied research are critical for the industry. He advocated the importance of characterisation in mineral research and collaborated with several of his colleagues in the Institute, notably Professors TR Ramachandran and Ranjit K Ray. The motivation of many of the research projects pursued under his guidance was to find innovative means of beneficiating several complex and/or low-grade Indian mineral deposits, such as monazite beach sand, zircon, molybdenite, diamond, phos¬¨phorites, zinc ferrite, zinc tailings and residues, alumina-rich iron ore, pyrite, separation amongst calcium mineral systems, Kudremukh-iron ore tailing, deep sea manganese nodules, ferrotungsten deposits etc. Simultaneous studies were also carried out in his laboratory on several key unit operations in mineral processing, such as comminution, froth flotation, selective flocculation, leaching and bacterial leaching . In basic research, some studies by Biswas and his coworkers received international attention; for example:select research publications in different areas (including those before MIT era): Surface Chemistry (general) J Phy Chem 64(1) (1960) 1‚Äì4, Journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society 37(4) (1960) 171‚Äì175 doi:10.1007/BF02631220, Nature 200(4912) (1963) 1203 doi:10.1038/2001203a0; Surface Chemistry (mineral processing) Trans SME (March 1964) 1‚Äì5, Nature 217(5135) (1968) 1255 doi:10.1038/2171255a0, J Colloid Interf Sci 64(2) (1978) 214‚Äì227 doi:10.1016/0021-9797(78)90357-0, Kolloid Zeitschrift & Zeitschrift F√ºr Polymere 254(5) (1978) 522‚Äì529 doi:10.1007/BF01410920, Intl J Miner Process 11(4) (1983) 285‚Äì302 doi:10.1016/0301-7516(83)90050-9, Colloids and Surfaces 8(4), 321‚Äì336. doi:10.1016/0166-6622(84)80127-4 and 9(3) (1984) 219‚Äì235 doi:10.1016/0166-6622(84)80165-1; Characterisation Trans Indian Inst Metals 37(3) (1984) 234‚Äì241, Physica Status Solidi A 87(1) (1985) 267‚Äì271 doi:10.1002/pssa.2210870126, Trans Indian Inst Metals 44(2) 119‚Äì130, 45(5) 287‚Äì301, 47(5) 273‚Äì285; Leaching/bio-leaching Hydrometallurgy 2(2) (1976) 171‚Äì184 doi:10.1016/0304-386X(76)90026-8, Hydrometallurgy 15(3) (1986) 267‚Äì280 doi:10.1016/0304-386X(86)90060-5, Hydrometallurgy 25(1) (1990) 61‚Äì83 doi:10.1016/0304-386X(90)90065-A, J.

Biswas was the founder-president of the Indian Languages Society, which organized a national seminar on Profiles in Indian languages during 10‚Äì12 December 1982. The proceedings of the seminar were published as a multi-authored book Profiles in Indian languages and literatures, which received international acclaim. The period around 1980 was also the beginning of his increasing interest in archaeometallurgy. Characterisation studies on ancient slag and retorts from Zawar mines later culminated in a number of papers on the primacy of India in brass and zinc metallurgy. During 1987‚Äì90, History of Science Division of Indian National Science Academy (INSA) sponsored a project on 'Minerals and Metals in Ancient India up to 1200 AD from Sanskrit Literature and other Sources'. In this project, he was ably assisted by his wife, Sulekha, a Sanskrit scholar. The project completion report submitted in 1991 later (in 1996) resulted in the publication of the monumental monograph called 'Minerals and Metals in Ancient India'. This two volume monograph (volume 1 ‚Äì Archaeological Evidence, Volume ‚Äì 2 Literary Evidence) tells the fascinating, coherently woven story of the Mineral and Metals from across the entire sub-continental sprawl of the old-world India (including Pakistan and Bangladesh). In following years (1991‚Äì94), INSA sponsored another project on Minerals and Metals in Pre-Modern period (1200‚Äì1900 AD) which led to the publication of several interesting papers in Indian J History of Science; Gem minerals in pre-Modern India, Non-Gem Minerals in Pre-modern India and Iron and Steel in Pre-modern India. Biswas delved deep into the ancient Indian texts and established the etymology of beryllium-containing minerals in the Indian and world literature ‚Äì particularly of Beryl (Vaidurya) and emerald (Marakata). Similarly, other topics related to history of science included : History of science in India : In search of a new paradigm, Rasa-Ratna Samuccaya and Mineral Processing State of Art in the 13th Century A.D. India, Revered father Eugene Lafont and science activity of St Xavier's College,Revered father Eugene Lafont and science activity of St Xavier‚Äôs College During the period 1985‚Äì94, he also wrote and edited several books * Swami Vivekananda and the Indian Quest for Socialism (Firma KLM Pvt Ltd, Calcutta, 1986); * A Pilgrimage to Khetri and the Sarasvati Valley (Sujan Publications, Calcutta, 1987); * Buddha and Bodhisattva ‚Äì A Hindu View (Cosmo Publications, New Delhi, 1987); * Frontiers in Applied Chemistry (edited volume, Springer Verlag, Berlin and Narosa Publishing House, New Delhi, 1989); and * Swami Vijnanananda and his Paramahamsa Carita (Sujan Publication, 1994). The superannuation of Professor Biswas from IIT/K on 31 July 1994, marked the beginning of a new chapter in his life. He moved to Kolkata where he spent a lot more time with Ramakrishna Mission. He served several organizations in various honorary capacities for example, Mahendralal Sircar Research Professor in History of Science at the Asiatic Society, Kolkata (1995‚Äì2001); the AICTE Emeritus Fellow at the Jadavpur University (2001‚Äì2004); and INSA Research Fellow in Kolkata. He joined as a member of the INSA National Commission for History of Science and the editorial board member of the Indian Journal of the History of Science.  Post IIT Kanpur era  = Research papers and book reviews = Biswas's academic interest and firm conviction that both social sciences and humanities and science and technology are essential for human progress, propelled him to publish a large number of research papers and reviews on a wide spectrum of topics.References to papers in Indian Journal of History of Science can be found on the link (see also cited reference to his papers in these publications) The topics covered included: Epic of Saltpetre to Gunpowder; Why did Scientific Renaissance take place in Europe and not in India;Why did Scientific Renaissance take place in Europe and not in India] Brass and zinc metallurgy in the ancient and medieval world : India's primacy and the technology transfer to the west, Raman, Krishnan and the IACS Episodes of the 1930s; The Era of Science Enthusiasts in Bengal (1841‚Äì1891): Akshayakumar's; Vidyasagar and Rajendralala; Calcuttan Science 1784‚Äì1930 and the Awakening in India; Rammohun Roy, his Intellectual Compatriots and their Scientific Contributions; Science in the Path of Syncretism, Syncretism in the Future of Humankind ‚Äì Some Golden thoughts of Swami Vivekananda;in Vivekanda as the Turning Point, 150th Birth Anniversary Volume, Advaita Ashrama, Mayavati, January 2013, pp. 257‚Äì286 Social Factors in the Development of Technology in Ancient India;in History of Technology in Ancient India, Volume I edited by A.K Bag, Indian National Science Academy, New Delhi, 1997, pp.677 ‚Äì 703 Science, Spirituality and Socialism: A Tribute to Joseph Needham;in The Life and Works of Joseph Needham, edited by Sushil Kumar Mukherjee and Amitabha Ghosh, The Asiatic Society, Calcutta, 1997, pp. 93‚Äì110 Science and Music with a Special Note on Helmholtz, James Jeans to Pandit Ravishankar.

It was opened in 1970 as a state-owned enterprise during the Soviet period. After the collapse of the USSR, Ani Hotel was privatized in 1998, and after a major renovation it was reopened as Ani Plaza Hotel in 1999. It is named after the medieval Armenian city of Ani, one of the historical capitals of the Armenian nation. The hotel is located on 19 Sayat-Nova Avenue, at the intersection with Abovyan Street.

The state-governed Intourist agency was the regulating body of the hotels and tourism within the Soviet Union. A permission was granted from the central government in Moscow to build 4 new hotels in Yerevan through the efforts of Iliya Gevorgov, who was the director of the Intourist agency branch in the Armenian SSR. The first of the 4 hotels to be constructed was the Ani Hotel. The newly opened Sayat- Nova Avenue was chosen as the site of the hotel. The design was composed by an architectural group included Eduard Safaryan, Phoenix Darbinyan and Felix Hakobyan. The trio had previously designed many of the residential buildings at the nearby Abovyan Street. The construction of the hotel was launched in 1964 and completed by the end of 1969. The project was directed by Albert Sargsyan 1964-65), Victor Virabyan (1965-67) and Karlen Gharibyan (1967‚Äì69). In 1970, the hotel was officially opened at the 50th anniversary of the Sovietization of Armenia. Following the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide in 1965, Armenian nationalism had a widespread revival among the young Armenians within the Soviet-ruled Armenia. Thus, the hotel was named after the ancient city of Ani‘±’∂’´ ’∞’µ’∏÷Ç÷Ä’°’∂’∏÷Å ’•÷Ç ¬´’à÷Ç÷Ä’°÷Ä’ø’∏÷Ç¬ª ’º’•’Ω’ø’∏÷Ä’°’∂\` ’Ø’•’∂’§’°’∂’´ ’∫’°’ø’¥’∏÷Ç’©’µ’∏÷Ç’∂ (currently in Turkey), which served as the capital of the Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia between 961 and 1045. The royal emblem of the Bagratuni dynasty was placed at the entrance to the hotel. At the time of its inauguration, Ani Hotel became the tallest building of the city, and the largest hotel in Yerevan. The total cost of the hotel summed 5 million Soviet rubles. Upon its opening, Ani Hotel was awarded a diploma by the Architects Union of the USSR as the best structure of 1970. Ani Plaza Hotel Ani Hotel hosted the FC Bayern Munich players during March 1975. In 1979, BB King stayed in the hotel along with his band, during his tour in the Soviet Union. The Russian jazz singer Larisa Dolina has performed several times in the hotel.

History  By 1145 the free knights of Reifenberg had moved from Ettling near Ingolstadt. They also went under the name of Speinshart and were founders of Speinshart Abbey. In 1160 Emperor Frederick I confirmed the estate of Reifenberg Castle to Bishop Eberhard II of Bamberg and in 1185 Pope Lucius III confirmed the estate to the Bishopric of Bamberg. In 1430, during the Hussite Wars, the castle was damaged, but rebuilt in stages up to 1446. In 1460 the castle chapel of St. Nicholas was mentioned for the first time.

Background Despite the approval of economical measures proposed by the Italian government (with Legge 30 luglio 2010, n. 122 and with Legge 15 luglio 2011 n. 111), on 4 August 2011 the spread of decennial btp-bund reached 389 points. La Repubblica - Da Berlusconi a Monti, la drammatica estate 2011 tra spread e rischi di bancarotta (From Berlusconi to Monti, the dramatic summer 2011 between spread and risks of bankrupt) Historical context On 5 August 2011, during dramatic crisis of European banks, the former governor of ECB, Jean Claude Trichet, together with Mario Draghi, wrote a \\"secret\\" letter to Italian government, at the time led by Silvio Berlusconi, in which they pushed for a series of economic measures \\"to be implemented as soon as possible\\". The Letter of ECB to Italy that inflamed political debate By complying of these measures, the support of ECB was implicitly conditioned by massive purchase of Italian bonds on the secondary market. This initiative represented an absolute novelty Il Sole 24 Ore - The letter from Frankfurt that changed Italy and, for several commentators, a strong interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign country. Requested measures The letter specified the measures considered urgent in order to avoid the collapse of the country and of Euro. Listed points were: Corriere della Sera - ¬´C'√® l'esigenza di misure significative per accrescere il potenziale di crescita¬ª (¬´There is the necessity of significant measures in order to increase the growth potential¬ª) *1. Significant measures in order to increase the growth potential; *2. Immediate and decided measures to ensure the sustainability of public finances; **2.a Further measures of balance revision; **2.b Clause of automatic deficit reduction; **2.c Strict control about debt assumption, even commercial, and about expenses of regional and local authorities. Publication of the letter On 5 August 2011, the same day of the letter, with closed markets, Berlusconi and Tremonti summoned press conference to explain an extraordinary maneuver for Italy. La Repubblica - Crisi, Berlusconi anticipa la manovra (Crisis, Berlusconi anticipates the maneuver) After this conference, press began to talk about a \\"secret letter\\" of ECB sent to Italian government. Andrea D'Ambra, president of Generazione attiva association, asked to ECB to see that letter, but on 7 September 2011 ECB answered that \\"the letter must remain secret\\": Contropiano - Bce: \\"La lettera all‚ÄôItalia deve rimanere segreta\\" (ECB: \\"The letter to Italy must remain secret\\") On 29 September 2011, a scoop of Corriere della Sera reveals this letter to public opinion. Corriere della Sera - Il documento segreto della Bce (The secret document of ECB) Consequences The Italian government during August proposed further economical measures that Parliament approved in almost one month with Legge 14 settembre 2011 n. 148 (Conversione in legge, con modificazioni, del decreto-legge 13 agosto 2011, n. 138, recante ulteriori misure urgenti per la stabilizzazione finanziaria). Nevertheless, in a political confrontation between Berlusconi, Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy on 22 October 2011, these measures were considered insufficient, in a meeting that was \\"defined in the following days as tense and extremely hard towards the government of Rome by Valentino Valentini, the personal adviser in international relationship of Italian Prime Minister. Merkel and Sarkozy, which evidently did not tolerate excuses about current difficult situation of Italy, pushed on Prime Minister, so that he announced strong and concrete measures, and to apply in order to demonstrate that his government is serious about debt problem\\".

Il Giornale - La verit√† su Re Giorgio e il 2011 (The truth about \\"King George\\" and 2011) According to this theory, the famous press conference of the following day (in which the leaders of Germany and France, before to answer to the question about their trust in Berlusconi and in the solidity of Italy, Giornalettismo - La Merkel e Sarkozy ridono di Berlusconi (Merkel and Sarkozy laugh at Berlusconi) exchanged a wry smile, and then said to have trust in the sense of responsibility of Italian political, economical and financial institutions), La Repubblica - Berlusconi spiato da NSA (Berlusconi spied by NSA) had activated the President of Italian Republic Giorgio Napolitano Il Giornale - L'ultimo tassello che dimostra il complotto di Napolitano & C.

He is professor emeritus at La Trobe University Melbourne. Career Blake was born in the northern Melbourne suburb of Ascot Vale. His father was an accomplished speaker of rhyming slang, and Blake was raised listening to talk in which a priest would be called 'cream and yeast', nuns 'currant buns' and being drunk ('pissed') 'Brahms and Liszt'. After graduating from Melbourne University with an honours degree in Latin and English, he worked as a secondary school teacher before joining the Australian Department of Defence where he worked as a language instructor. In 1966, he became a research fellow at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies at Monash University and began to undertake field research and analysis of three moribund three indigenous languages, Kalkatungu, once spoken around Mount Isa in central Queensland and which was the basis for his M.A.thesis (1968), Pitta Pitta and Yalarnnga. He obtained his PhD at Monash in 1975. He was elected fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities in 1987, and in the following year was appointed to the Foundation Chair in linguistics at La Trobe University. He has recently reconstructed aspects of the extinct dialects of the Kulin languages from fragmentary evidence retrieved from various ethnographic reports made in the 19th century. Theoretical work Blake's theoretical work has made a decisive contribution to the long-standing debate over whether the observed distinction between the Pama-Nyungan languages and non-Pama-Nyungan languages of Australia was genetic or typological. Robert M. W. Dixon had reconstructed the elements of the proto-Australian pronoun system, and Blake did similar work for the non-Pama-Nyungan languages, showing that their verb pronominal prefix forms may well have descended from a single proto-language, with a distinct set of proto-pronouns, the implication being that there were two distinct proto-languages in the Australian continent. His linguistic interests have extended beyond Australia, in work on south East Asian languages where he has shown the phenomenon of ergativity is much more widespread than had previously been thought. He has done pioneering studies in the field of linguistic typology and case-marking systems. For example, he developed the hierarchy of cases.

She was probably born in what is now Estonia. She was the first female test pilot, testing airplanes for Anthony Fokker, the French aircraft firm Morane-Saulnier, and the Russian airplane manufacturer Fedor Tereshchenko. During World War I, she flew missions for the Red Cross and during the civil war, may have flown observation missions for the Red Army. In 1923, she moved to the United States and made several attempts to be the first woman to make a transatlantic fight, though none ever came to fruition. After 1930, she quit flying and worked in various positions, including as a taxi driver. Name and birthplace variants There is some confusion about Golanchikova's place of birth and the spelling of her name. While her parents appear to have been ethnic Russians, there are suggestions she was born in Viljandi, now in Estonia, but at the time of her birth in the Russian Empire. Writing on the Early Birds of Aviation website in 2006, the Estonian author and aeronautical historian Toivo Kitvel of Tallinn has said, that he has a copy of the Viljandi Greek-Orthodox birth register with a record of her birth and baptism. Although she may have been brought up in St. Petersburg, Russian articles stating she was born in St. Petersburg, are probably mistaken. As a result of the difficulty of transliterating Russian names into English and of Golanchikova's own variations in the use of her name, there are a number of variants. These include Ljuba Galantchikova (from Russian), Lioubov Golantchikova (French), Ljuba Galantschikoff (German), and Ljuba Golant≈°ikova (Estonian). An example of her own signature in northern European cursive longhand (see photo in box) is probably L. Galantchikoff. The 'T' has sometimes been interpreted as an 'S', giving L. Galanschikoff. Even in recent times, transliterations of her name are numerous. After her move to the United States, she used Luba Phillips for the American press, but may have used Luba Philipoff or Philippoff officially. When American press reported her maiden name, it was either as Luba Galanchikoff or as Luba Galanschikoff. Early life Lyubov Alexandrovna Golanchikova was born in 1889 in Viljandi, then in Russian Empire, to Olga and Aleksander Golantschikoff as the sixth child. The family was Russian Orthodox, and thus carried a Russian name. Her family was of modest means. Her father worked as a postal official in Viljandi, but died before Golanchikova reached her first year of age. The church books say, that the widowed Olga remarried on 26 August 1890 to Karl Gr√ºnwald, who was born in the Pskov Governorate, and maintained a workshop on Tartu Street 21. Through her mother's remarriage, Golanchikova now had a stepfather. In 1910, Golanchikova went to study in Saint Petersburg. Her stepfather encouraged her to study accounting. Though she enrolled in accounting courses, she found the work uninspiring and became a child actress, working in vaudeville as a singer and dancer. She was discovered by one Arnold Oskarovtich (Arnold the son of Oskar, thought to be an Estonian), the impresario of \\"Folie Bergere\\", who invited her to perform in Villa Rode, a restaurant next to the Kolomyazhskiy hippodrome. There, she took the stage name of \\"Molly Moret\\" (). Interest in flying On 27 April 1910, on the grounds of the hippodrome, and also right next to Villa Rode, the first Russian air show took place, and lasted eighteen days. In addition to lesser- known Russian airmen, the show was visited by then the most popular airmen of the day: Charles Edmonds, Hubert Latham, Leon Morane, and also the first airwoman -- baroness Raymonde de la Roche. Golantchikova aka \\"Molly More\\" attended with her friends as a spectator. The airshow was very successful. Towards the end of Summer, a second airshow took place. It was called the All- Russia Aeronautics Festival, and it opened on then the new Commandant's airfield (–ö–æ–º–µ–Ω–¥–∞–Ω—Ç—Å–∫–∏–π –∞—ç—Ä–æ–¥—Ä–æ–º). The air tricks that were performed by Lebedev, Utotchkin, and Mikhail Efimov, military pilots Gorshkov, Rudnev, and others took the city by storm. After attending that festival, \\"Molly\\" began reading everything she could find about flying, and met up with the many pilots who were all young and the same age as her. In Fall 1910, Golanchikova finally got acquainted with , a former electrician from Odessa, who took her on a flight as a passenger, and from then on, she decided she would learn to fly. For that, she began to collect money through the winter to attend school the next Spring. Education and flight school When Golanchikova took up flying in 1911, she went to school and to flight lessons during the day and worked nights, graduating from high school at the same time as she received her pilot's license. She joined the Shchetinin Flying School at Gatchina airfield, passed her examination, and on 9 October 1911, became the third Russian woman with a pilot's license. Air shows After earning her license, Golanchikova tried to find work as a pilot or in delivery, but was unable to do so, as potential employers suggested piloting was not women's business. She realised, that if she wanted to fly, the only avenue open to her was as a performer in airshows. By then, the stage name \\"Molly More\\" was shed. In April 1912, Golanchikova was invited by the local air club to an exhibition in Riga, where she was involved in a serious crash landing, but she escaped with minor injuries and returned to St. Petersburg. A St. Petersburg gazette recounted, that a foolish spectator had thrown a thick wooden stick at the airplane, which had caused the accident. In late Summer 1912, the \\"Second Military Air Contest\\" was held in St. Petersburg, and though injured, Golanchikova tried out several new aircraft, performing aerobatic maneuvers with skill. She had the ability to precisely pinpoint each airplane's deficiencies, and engineers began taking notes. That also included Anthony Fokker, whom she met at the show: he asked 'Fr√§ulein Galantchikova' her opinion about his new plane, and she told him she liked the way his planes \\"handled\\". Subsequently, Fokker invited Golanchikova to Berlin to participate in an international airshow to be held in Fall 1912. For the next several months, she flew in barnstorming events throughout rural Russia and Poland. At the international airshow held on 22 November 1912, Golanchikova took to the air setting a new world altitude record for women of 2,200 meters, crushing the previous record of 825 meters held by German pilot Melli Beese. Career In early 1913, Golanchikova was offered a job by Fokker to work as his chief pilot, flying to European cities to promote his aircraft. Fokker was reported to be in love with Golanchikova, considering her to be the perfect woman. When she started flying his planes, he thought that having a pretty woman involved would be \\"great publicity\\". Though she was homesick, she was determined to stay in Germany, because she would not be able to find professional work as a pilot in Russia. But, in July 1913, the French aircraft firm Morane-Saulnier produced a two-seater plane and hired L√©on Letort to test it. He flew the leg from Paris to Berlin, and then offered Golanchikova the opportunity to fly with him on the return trip as navigator. After she obtained Fokker's agreement to make the flight with Letort, they took off for Paris. Bad weather conditions plagued the flight and after much difficulty, four days later they crashed in a field near the town of Bray-sur-Seine, about 100 km southeast of Paris. The plane was not damaged and the following day the duo was feted with a large reception. When she returned to her room at H√¥tel du Brabant, Golanchikova's room was full of floral bouquets, one of which had the business card of , a wealthy Ukrainian sugar producer. Tereshchenko owned an aircraft construction business and wanted to hire someone to test his designs. When her contract with Fokker expired, four months later, Golanchikova returned to Russia to work for Tereshchenko. On 1 December 1913, she signed a contract to become the first female test pilot, agreeing to test \\"Farman-22\\" aircraft manufactured in the Chervonskaya airplane workshop, in Chervone. When her contract was up at the end of a year, Golanchikova returned to Moscow and married Boris Philipoff, who was known as the \\"Bread King of Russia\\". During World War I, Golanchikova carried Red Cross supplies and in 1917, she flew as an observer for the Imperial Air Force, serving with the 26th Corps Reconnaissance Squadron. During the Russian Revolution, Golanchikova switched sides and flew for the Red Air Fleet, as well as training their pilots. She may have flown several missions for the revolutionary forces during the civil war. In October 1923, \\"Boris and Lubow Philipoff\\" (per the manifest) emigrated to the United States aboard the White Star Line's S.S. Baltic. After arriving in the U.S. she became known as Luba Phillips in the United States and Ljuba or Luba Galanchikoff abroad. In June, 1927, Phillips tried for an altitude record flying with W. L. Stultz at the controls. Though there were observers from the press and the altimeter rose to eleven thousand feet, the flight was unofficial, as no representatives of the National Aeronautic Association were in attendance. Phillips planned to make a transatlantic flight from New York to Rome on 10 July 1927 but the plan did not materialize. Three days after the failed attempt, she was still hoping to become the first woman to cross the Atlantic. Phillips signed a one-year contract for picture rights with the theatrical producer Oliver Morosco for the attempt. Though she made several plans, New York to France, New York to London, New York to Leningrad she did not complete any of the trips and appears to have stopped flying by 1930, when she was working in a beauty parlor at the Hotel Ansonia in New York City. Her husband died in Manhattan in 1936 and in the 1940s Phillips drove a taxi in New York City. Phillips died on 28 March 1959, in New York City.

It was probably first performed in 1602.Introduction to text in Delphi Complete Works of John Webster, Delphi Classics eBook, 2015  Plot  The play opens with the death of King Edward VI. Under the will of King Henry VIII, his daughter Mary was due to succeed, but, under an Act of Parliament later in the reign of Edward VI, Lady Jane Grey was entitled to take the throne. Her father-in-law, John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, proclaims Jane Grey Queen and forces her to accept, though she is reluctant. Thomas Wyatt the Younger goes to Mary, who rejoices at the death of her half-brother Edward VI, and encourages her to move fast to assert her claim. Support for Jane Grey vanishes away and the Duke of Northumberland is arrested and charged with treason. Jane Grey and her husband Guildford Dudley are also arrested. Mary, now acknowledged Queen, accepts a marriage proposal from the future Philip II of Spain. Wyatt protests vehemently and leaves the court to mount a rebellion based in Kent. When London does not let his forces in, they scatter, leaving Wyatt to be captured. In the last part of the play, Jane Grey, Guildford Dudley and Thomas Wyatt are executed.  Characteristics of the Play  The play consists of a series of short episodes with relatively little emphasis on detailed characterisation. It is not divided into Acts or Scenes. The style is plain, with little use of metaphor. Much of the play is in blank verse. Jane Grey and her husband are presented as a loving couple caught up in the machinations of others. Despite the title of the play, Jane Grey's role is as central as that of Sir Thomas Wyatt. Wyatt himself is shown as someone loyal to the wishes of Henry VIII and opposed to foreign influence in English affairs. Stephen Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester, makes several appearances and is portrayed as a harsh supporter of Mary who is uncompromising in his treatment of those who oppose her or her policies. In the second half of the play there is some anti-Spanish sentiment, reflecting the state of hostility between England and Spain when the play was written and in the preceding decades. As in many plays of the period, there are passages featuring a clown. These give light relief but contribute little to the main plot.  Sources  The play may have drawn heavily on a previous play called Lady Jane, thought to have been written by Henry Chettle, Thomas Heywood and Wentworth Smith. This earlier work has not survived.Introduction to text in Delphi Complete Works of John Webster, Delphi Classics eBook, 2015  Publishing History  The play was first published in 1607, and there is a copy of this edition in the British Library.British Library BLL01000896055 It was not published again until its inclusion in an 1830 edition of the works of John Webster which was put together by Alexander Dyce.British Library BLL01014831826 Most recently, it can be found in Delphi Complete Works of John Webster, an eBook issued by Delphi Classics in 2015, which reproduces the Dyce introduction and text.

At the time, the warehouse in the Fruitvale neighborhood of Oakland, California, was hosting a concert featuring artists from the house music record label 100% Silk. The warehouse was only permitted for industrial purposes while residential and entertainment uses were illegal. Of the 80 to 100 people attending the concert, 36 were killed, the deadliest in the history of Oakland. It was also the deadliest building fire in the United States since The Station nightclub fire in 2003, the deadliest in California since the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and the deadliest mass- casualty event in Oakland since the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. The Alameda County District Attorney's office launched an investigation into the fire's causes. In March 2017, emails from 2014 were reported to have described serious electrical problems in the building. On June 5, 2017, Ghost Ship's master tenant Derick Almena and his assistant Max Harris were arrested and charged with felony involuntary manslaughter. On July 3, 2018, both pleaded no contest to thirty-six counts of involuntary manslaughter in a plea bargain with prosecutors. On August 10, 2018, the judge overseeing the case discarded the plea deals and the pair were put on trial. If convicted, their punishment could have ranged from probation up to 36 years in prison. On September 4, 2019, the deliberations ended when the jury deadlocked 10-2 for conviction on the 36 counts manslaughter charges pending against Almena, resulting in a mistrial. Harris was acquitted on all 36 counts. In July 2020, the City of Oakland settled a civil lawsuit for the victims and agreed to pay a total of $33 million; $9 million to one person who survived with lifelong injuries, and $24 million to the families of the 36 who perished in the fire. In August 2020, PG&E; settled a civil lawsuit for 32 of the victims for an undisclosed amount.  Background  = Building = The 160-by-48 foot cement-block warehouse was constructed in 1930. The property was purchased in 1988 by Chor Ng, who is linked to 17 other properties in the San Francisco Bay Area. Ng also owned a body shop, cell phone store, and other businesses nearby. The auto body shop and the cell phone store shared the same electrical supply as the Ghost Ship. One resident who rented a space in the building during 2014 reported that the entire building's electrical system was dependent on extension cords. She was so uncomfortable with the safety issues that she slept in her car. = Ownership and management = Chor Ng leased the property to Derick Almena and Nicholas Bouchard in 2013. They stated in the lease agreement that the property would be used as an art collective \\"to build and create theatrical sets and offer workshops for community outreach.\\" Almena named the building the Ghost Ship. He lived on the second floor with his wife and two daughters and a son. He illegally sublet space on the first floor, charging about 25 resident artists between $300 and $600 a month rent. A one- bedroom apartment in Oakland at the time typically cost more than $2,000. Almena told members of the artist collective who worked and lived there to tell people the warehouse was a 24-hour art studio, not that they lived there. In 2014 or 2015, Almena told Police Officer Hector Chavez that no one lived in the building, and he repeated the same statement several months before the fire to Police Officer Brian Kline. The collective was informally known by the tenants as Satya Yuga. A former tenant from 2016, Danielle Boudreaux, said Almena used the tenants' rent to cover the warehouse rent, and used proceeds from the parties to pay his living expenses. = Makeshift spaces= Use of the warehouse building for housing and entertainment was illegal. Landlord Chor Ng stated that no one lived in the building, according to a statement translated by her daughter Eva. However, neighbors reported that they saw people living in the building. Living spaces on the first floor were connected by makeshift hallways constructed of \\"aggregates of salvaged and scavenged materials, such as pianos, organs, windows, wood benches, lumber, and innumerable other items stacked next to and on top of each other.\\" The live- work spaces were separated by a variety of things, including \\"wooden studs, steel beams, doors, window frames, bed frames, railings, pianos, benches, chairs, intact motorhomes and trailers, portions of trailers, corrugated metal sheeting, tapestries, plywood, sculptures, tree stumps and tree limbs.\\" Almena said that he, his wife, and his three children slept in the warehouse. Residents and others verified that he lived with his wife and children on the second floor and rented space to as many as 18 others who lived in recreational vehicles and makeshift rooms on the first floor. A person who had lived in the warehouse for a time and he described the building as \\"a whole maze to get through,\\" filled with wooden objects. He said he left because it was \\"too sketchy to continue to stay there.\\" One victim of the fire was a building resident. = Known problems= Ghost Ship warehouse 20 days after the fire The city had received ten complaints about the property since 1998, including formal complaints about hazardous garbage and construction debris around the building. The Oakland Planning and Building Department opened an investigation into the building on November 13 based on a complaint about \\"blight\\" and \\"illegal interior construction\\". City building inspectors visited the warehouse on November 17, confirming the report of blight, but when no one answered the door, were unable to enter and investigate the report of illegal construction. Inspectors are required to obtain permission from owners to gain entry, and when that fails, must seek a court order. A spokesperson for the Planning and Building Department stated that promoters of events like the concert on December 2 are required to obtain a special permit, but none had been issued. The City of Oakland's planning director revealed that the building had not been inspected for three decades. Although police and fire officials warned that the warehouse was a fire hazard, the Ghost Ship's founder, Derick Ion Almena, was reported to have ignored these concerns. The vice president of the local firefighters union said that the fire marshal's office had been understaffed for years and that a fire inspector upon seeing the conditions of the Ghost Ship \\"would have shut the place down\\". On December 13, the Oakland Fire Chief said \\"there were no indications this was an active business\\", that there are no city records showing her department had received complaints about the building and that the department \\"inspects businesses, not buildings\\". = Electrical problems = Max Ohr, creative director of the artist collective, said the collective had reported electrical problems to the owner of the building. The East Bay Times reported on March 24, 2017, that the son of the building owner wrote an email about electrical problems to Derick Almena on February 15, 2015. The Times stated that Almena illegally sublet living space to other artists within the warehouse. They found emails showing that Almena had complained to the owner's son that electricity in the building used \\"ancient and violated lines of distribution\\" that were \\"in dire need of a total and immediate upgrade.\\" The paper reported that an electrician who was currently unlicensed had performed repairs in 2014. He found ungrounded subpanels and \\"deferred maintenance dating back decades requiring immediate intervention.\\" He reported to the owners that a single transformer meant for lighting was being used for three businesses in spaces owned by Chor Ng, exceeding its capacity. An attorney representing victims' families stated, \\"They were on notice that there was problems with the electricity.\\" In October, 2018, the Ngs responded to civil lawsuit blaming the electrical issues on Benjamin Cannon, who subleased space from the auto body shop. It was revealed that Cannon had installed a new transformer, distribution panels, and breakers. After a transformer burned, Cannon wrote in a January 2015 email to Kai Ng, that he would install a \\"cheaper\\" transformer that \\"we are going to use it a little bit differently than standard.\\" Cannon's electrical contractor's license expired in September 2010.  Fire  On the night of December 2, Harris hosted an electronic music concert featuring performers from house music record label 100% Silk and other independent musicians. From 80 to 100 people attended the event. Almena's wife and daughters went to a hotel so the girls could sleep. Max Ohr, a jewelry-maker and resident, was doorman that night. When he saw the fire, he raced to his space, grabbing the biggest fire extinguisher he had. Anthony Perrault, who lived next to Ohr, grabbed his own fire extinguisher. With a third resident, they tried to put the fire out. But waves of fire exploded across the ceiling, igniting everything it touched. The three men dropped their extinguishers and ran toward the front, yelling \\"Fire!\\" Carmen Brito was sleeping in her space in the back when the smell of smoke woke her. She had just enough time to put on a coat and shoes and run to the front door. Within another minute the lights failed. Nikki Kelber had a space near the front. She barely had time to grab her cat and fled with fireballs right behind her. Ryan O‚ÄôKeefe later testified that within five seconds of seeing fire, the building \\"exploded into an inferno.\\" He said the smoke was so intense that he and three others could only yell \\"Fire!\\" before escaping. The fire spread extremely quickly and generated heavy, deadly smoke. Several factors prevented visitors of the second floor learning of the fire and impeded their escape from it. Most importantly, there were no fire alarms, fire sprinklers, or smoke alarms in the building. Once the fire was detected, the stairwells and their position relative to exits, the makeshift construction, and the huge fuel load created by the furnishings made it difficult to survive long enough to escape. There were two stairways, one in the back and an improvised one near the front. The rear stairway was concealed behind the stage and furnishings. The front stairway was made from a pile of stacked wooden pallets. A few people on the second floor were able to use the pile of pallets to escape. They had to crawl along the floor to avoid the dense smoke filling the building, and once on the first floor, struggled to find the front door because of the complicated layout and the many obstacles blocking the passages. The building was cluttered with wooden furniture, pianos, art, and mannequins. Wooden doors and pallets were used to separate the many small living spaces. Oakland Fire Department Chief Teresa Deloach Reed told reporters, \\"It was like a maze almost.\\" Firefighters extinguishing fire on December 3, 2016 The first firefighters, from Engine 13 whose station was one-and-a-half blocks away, reached the warehouse at 11:27 p.m., within three minutes of the first 911 call. Their only access was a man- door that had been cut through a commercial steel roll-up door. One company pushed inside on their hands and knees, trying to stay under the smoke, with about 50 feet of hose. The \\"terrible\\" smoke conditions offered almost zero visibility, and they kept bumping into obstacles they couldn't see. They could only advance in a zig zag pattern about 20 feet (7 m) into the building. Another company pushed a second line in, but they too could only advance about 25 feet (8 m). Chief James Bowron learned that up to 60 people might still be inside, but given the intensity of the fire and smoke, he believed any survivors would be found within their initial attack into the building. Concerned about losing nearby buildings, Bowron called a second alarm at 11:31 and a third alarm seven minutes after that. The pallet stairway was initially reported as the building's only stairs. Authorities said once the pallet stairs caught fire, it was instantly incinerated. Any party goers on the second floor who may have still been alive could not get down. No firefighter ever located the pallet staircase. In any case, neither stairway led directly to one of the two exits. About 22 minutes after the firefighter's arrival, the fire suddenly lit up the night sky. Four truck companies of firefighters were inside. They told Bowron that the second floor was already almost completely involved. Bowran feared for the safety of the firefighters. Due to the intensity of the fire and the danger of the second floor collapsing, Bowron ordered the firefighters to withdraw. They fought a \\"surround and drown\\" exterior defensive operation from that point forward. Seven minutes later the fire began \\"blowtorching\\" out the roof. Most of the second floor collapsed soon afterward, and later on the wood-clad steel beam roof collapsed as well. It took 52 firefighters, using 14 pieces of apparatus, until 4:36 a.m. to declare the fire under control. The firefighters who had been on scene all night knew that dozens of people were missing. They were shaken up knowing they had not rescued a single person. = Recovery = The next day the fire department search and rescue personnel began to stabilize the structure before they could search for victims. They deployed drone aircraft using thermal imaging that unsuccessfully searched for survivors. Due to the nature of the incident, investigators removed debris slowly and carefully, and it was three days before the last bodies were recovered. All but one of those killed were visitors to the warehouse. Seven victims were found on the remaining portion of the second floor, trapped by smoke and the missing stairway of wooden pallets that had burned. The other 29 victims were found on the first floor, one within feet of the side exit. Some of the victims were found huddled together, some unburned, under the collapsed second floor. = Fire origins = An early report blamed the fire on a faulty refrigerator, but this cause was rejected by agents from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, although agents initially left open the possibility that it was started by another electrical appliance or component. Investigators found \\"something screwed, welded, tacked, hammered or nailed to every square inch\\" of the building. According to Chief Bowron, \\"the fuel load inside was nothing short of incredible.\\" The debris included wooden pallets, statues, piles of furniture, mobile homes, and mannequins. Fire Department Operations Chief Mark Hoffman described the first floor as a \\"labyrinth.\\" On June 19, 2017, the Oakland fire department, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and the Alameda County Arson Task Force issued a 50-page report providing new details on the fire and subsequent recovery efforts. The report confirmed that all victims had died of smoke inhalation, the most common cause of fire fatalities, as previously reported. Investigators concluded that the fire began in the northwest area of the ground floor, and documented extensive damage to the electrical system, but were unable to pinpoint the precise cause due to the extent of the fire. The report also documents why it took days to remove the bodies after the blaze was out, as investigators were forced to slowly sift through the cluttered debris of the collapsed interior.  Legal aftermath = Criminal investigation = A criminal investigation was launched by the Alameda County District Attorney's Office on December 4. An arson investigation was also launched. Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf said charges against anyone found responsible could range from involuntary manslaughter to murder. In public remarks on January 23, 2017, lawyers for Almena claimed that the fire originated in a building adjacent to the warehouse, and that Almena should not be held responsible. A report of the investigation published on February 8, 2017, stated that investigators were unable to find an origin, noting that the investigation was ongoing and that the electrical system was part of the analysis. On March 14, 2017, Oakland Fire Department Chief Teresa Deloach Reed retired amidst questions about inspection procedures and management. The Alameda County lead prosecutor in charge of the investigation had been requesting the city fire department's report for several weeks when he finally received a copy on March 17. Its contents were not released to the public. On March 21, 2017, a judge ruled that debris from the fire must be preserved as potential evidence in pending lawsuits. = Prosecution = Derick Almena Max Harris On July 3, 2018, Almena and Harris each pled no contest to 36 counts of involuntary manslaughter. According to their agreement, Almena was to be sentenced to nine years in prison, and Harris to six. Some family members of those who died testified and protested the plea deal. Sentencing was set for August 9. But on August 10, 2018, the judge in the case threw out the plea deals, stating that Derick Almena failed to accept \\"full responsibility and remorse\\". The judge said that he would have accepted the plea deal for Harris because Harris showed remorse but the plea deal was made with both Almena and Harris. During the preliminary hearings, building owner Chor Ng was questioned, but invoked her Fifth Amendment right to avoid testifying and the possibility of incriminating herself. Ng is among a number of parties that are being sued by victims' relatives. Witnesses described the Ghost Ship warehouse as a \\"death trap.\\" Almena and Harris individually faced the possibility of penalties ranging from probation to 36 years in prison if the prosecutor could prove criminal negligence and a unanimous jury found them guilty. Pending trial, Almena and Harris both remained in jail, unable to pay $750,000 in bail. Almena's attorney Tony Serra and Harris' attorney Curtis Briggs both said that much of their defense would involve diverting blame to others. The trial began on April 2, 2019. Prosecution witnesses testified about the history of violations found over the years. Almena contradicted their statements, saying all of the city, police and fire officials were lying. During his testimony, he said a building inspector, a Child Protective Services agent, six members of the fire department, and three police officers had been to the building several times on social occasions and never mentioned any violations. Almena blamed the landlord for tricking him into renting a building that lacked adequate plumbing or electricity. Almena and Harris' attorneys claimed that the fire was arson. They called a witness who said she overheard a group of unidentified men at a taco truck claiming credit for starting the fire. Former Oakland Fire Marshal Maria Sabatini was called by the prosecution. She had been one of the principal fire investigators. She testified that although investigators believed the cause was probably an electrical failure, they could not determine the source because the fire destroyed possible indicators, and that there was no evidence of arson. Katleen Bouchard, the mother of Nicholas Bouchard who co-signed the lease with Almena, testified that she helped her son with research and plans to develop the artist collective. She met with her son, Almena and his wife in 2013. She provided information on how they could obtain permits to upgrade the building and grants to help pay the cost. She said that Almena \\"laughed at me\\" and said he would do things his own way. Nicholas Bouchard became concerned about the modifications to the building that Almena made, including a 20 x 20 foot hole in the second floor, and distanced himself from the project. Police officer Moises Palanco visited the building in 2015. On body cam footage played during the trial, he was heard saying, \\"It's a huge fireplace in here.\\" Prosecutors attempted to show that Almena failed to place smoke alarms, emergency exit signs, and fire suppression systems in the building while filling the space with art projects, furniture, sculptures, windows, doors, and salvaged and scavenged used items that made it difficult for the victims to find a way out. The prosecution showed that all of the victims died of smoke inhalation, not burns. Almena was asked during his testimony if he had obtained legal permits for the kitchen he installed, for a side door, for the plumbing or electrical work, or the stairs in the front of the building. Almena said he had \\"no permits for anything.\\" He also said he didn't obtain operational permits for events because he didn't think they were required. Harris testified that the title of Executive Director he sometimes used was inflated and an attempt to \\"add authority to his emails to landlords and event planners.\\" But during his testimony, the prosecutor was able to show that Harris had a role in communicating about rent with the landlords, negotiated terms and evictions with other tenants, and was the primary contact for the group who presented the concert and party on the night of the blaze. The jury convened on Wednesday July 31, 2019. On August 20, after 10 days of weighing the evidence, the judge replaced three of the jurors. The jury was required to restart deliberations. Two of the dismissed jurors could be charged with contempt for allegedly violating the judges' rules about reading or talking to the media about the case. On the same day, the judge also dismissed two motions by the defense for a mistrial. On September 4, 2019, the deliberations ended when the jury deadlocked 10-2 for conviction on the 36 counts manslaughter charges pending against Almena, resulting in a mistrial. Harris was acquitted on all 36 counts. Harris was released from jail while Almena remained behind bars. At a hearing on October 4, 2019, the judge set a new trial date for Almena in March 2020. A defense motion that his $750,000 bail be reduced was denied. Almena remained in jail. On January 31, 2020, the trial was scheduled to begin in May, and jury selection will begin in early April. The defense lawyers said the statute of limitations meant the warehouse owners could no longer be prosecuted, they planned to call the Ng family as witnesses in Almena's next trial. In April 2020, Almena's lawyer was successful in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic in getting his bail reduced to $150,000. Almena is required to wear an ankle monitor. = Civil lawsuits = Numerous lawsuits related to the fire have been filed by 80 plaintiffs, naming 100% Silk, Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Ben Cannon, Derick Ion Almena, Max Harris, Chor Nar Siu Ng, the City of Oakland, Alameda County, and the State of California, and were subsequently consolidated. Plaintiff attorneys include Girardi & Keese, the firm which gained fame for taking on PG&E; in the Hinkley, California, case that inspired the movie Erin Brockovich. While a cause was never determined for the fire, on Dec 17, 2019, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali allowed the plaintiffs case claiming that the fire was caused by an electrical malfunction to continue against PG&E;, which, if successful, would receive money from PG&E;'s $900 million insurance money, but is not eligible to be part of the $13.5 billion allotted for the claims arising from the wildfires Butte Fire, Tubbs Fire, Camp Fire, and 2017 North Bay Fires. When questioned during the preliminary hearing, the warehouse owner Chor Ng and her daughter and son all pleaded the Fifth Amendment to every question. Civil attorneys are waiting until after the criminal statute of limitations ends on December 2, 2019, three years since the fire, when they expect to get depositions from the Ngs. In July 2020, the City of Oakland settled a civil lawsuit for the victims and agreed to pay a total of $33 million; $9 million to one person who survived with lifelong injuries, and $24 million to the families of the 36 who perished in the fire. In August 2020, PG&E; settled a civil lawsuit for 32 of the victims, out of the 36 who perished in the fire. The amount of the settlement was undisclosed, but it was limited to the amount available under PG&E;‚Äôs insurance coverage for the year 2016. Reactions Ghost Ship warehouse interior, post fire In an interview, Oakland City Council member Noel Gallo said that city officials \\"need to enforce the codes that we have\\" and that \\"we should have been more assertive in the past.\\" The Oakland Athletics baseball team offered to match donations for those affected, up to $30,000; the Oakland Raiders football team soon joined them. The Oakland-based Golden State Warriors basketball team announced a donation of $50,000 to the Fruitvale-based Unity Council. The Warriors announced an additional $75,000 donation to relief efforts on December 7, 2016. Warriors player Stephen Curry auctioned off two pairs of his shoes for $45,201 to benefit the Oakland Fire Relief fund. By December 9, 2016 the Gray Area Foundation for the Arts had raised over $550,000 and scheduled a benefit concert for December 14, 2016, featuring Bay Area musicians such as Primus, Tune-yards, and Boots Riley. A Facebook Safety Check was deployed in early December 2016 to help people find the whereabouts of friends and family who might have been in attendance. On December 3, 2016, the record label 100% Silk posted on their Facebook page: \\"What happened in Oakland is an unbelievable tragedy, a nightmare scenario. Britt and I are beside ourselves, utterly devastated. We are a very tight community of artists and we are all praying, sending love and condolences to everyone involved and their families.\\" Almena, who had not attended the party, posted a message on Facebook at around 1:30 a.m. that he was soon criticized for because he failed to mention the victims: Almena later said he was unaware that people had been killed. In a brief interview on December 5, he spoke of the families of the victims, saying, \\"They're my children. They're my friends, they're my family, they're my loves, they're my future.\\" In another interview on December 6, Almena said he was \\"incredibly sorry\\" and defended himself against charges of profit-seeking, saying, \\"This is not profit, this is loss. This is a mass grave.\\" On the night of December 5, 2016, hundreds of people attended vigils in Oakland and San Francisco in honor of the victims. Local residents, including artists and tenants' rights activists, have cited the fire as a symptom of the San Francisco Bay Area's underlying housing crisis. City inspectors have voiced suspicions that dozens of live-work warehouses similar to Ghost Ship exist in Oakland. On December 6, 2016, Mayor Libby Schaaf announced $1.7 million in grant funding to create affordable spaces for artists and arts organizations. She announced a planned revival and expansion of a task force on Artist Housing and Work Spaces, and the creation of a fire safety task force. Comparisons were drawn between this fire and the 1990 Happy Land fire, a nightclub fire in New York City that claimed 87 lives. The Happy Land fire also involved controversial operations of the structure, and suffered from similar conditions including lack of emergency exits and poor maintenance. In June 2017, local artist Chris Edwards built a boat sculpture in memory of Ghost Ship and installed it in the nearby Emeryville harbor. People have used it as a place to visit and leave flowers.

Downloaded on 6 November 2016.  History  The decision to build a children's railway in Novosibirsk, was announced in August 2003 by the West Siberian Railway together with the city council of Novosibirsk, when the foundation stone was laid in Zayeltsovsky Park, although the planning had not yet been fully completed. The design of the track was contracted to the institutions Sibgiprotrans and Zheldorproekt. On 4 June 2005 the first phase of the children's railway with a length of was inaugurated. It was formally taken in use on 30 June 2005 by the Director of the West Siberian Railway as the 23rd children's railway of Russia. The first phase contained a more than long steel pier, the stations Zoopark and Sportivnaya, a training centre at the Sportivnaya station as well as the halt Razyezd Eltsovskiy. In summer 2005 only one train operated. The train had one locomotive at each end, and could change direction without de-coupling the locomotives. On 14 November 2005 the President of the Russian Railways Vladimir Yakunin visited the railway. Starting from 6 August 2006 the second phase with a length of was constructed by the Russian Railways and the city council. The second phase contains a more than long steel pier, two bridges, the station Zayeltsovskiy Park and the halt Razyezd Lokomotiv. In 2015 the railway announced at its 10th anniversary that it had transported already more than 480,000 passengers.  Rolling stock = Locomotives = The children's railway operates three TU7A diesel locomotives with a power of 294 kW (400 hp) each and a weight of 24 t as well as a newer TU10 diesel locomotive with a power of 170 kW (230 hp).

It has two major tasks, as an imager from 0.6 to 5 micron wavelength, and as a wavefront sensor to keep the 18-section mirrors functioning as one. In other words, it is a camera and is also used to provide information to align the 18 segments of the primary mirror. It is an infrared camera with ten mercury-cadmium- telluride (HgCdTe) detector arrays, and each array has an array of 2048x2048 pixels. The camera has a field of view of 2.2x2.2 arc minutes with an angular resolution of 0.07 arcsec at 2 microns. NIRCam is also equipped with coronagraphs, which helps to collect data on exoplanets near stars. It helps with imaging anything next to a much brighter object, because the coronagraph blocks that light. NIRCam is housed in the Integrated Science Instrument Module, to which it is attached physically by struts. It is designed to operate at 37 Kelvin (roughly minus 400 degrees Fahrenheit), so it can detect infrared radiation at this wavelength.NIRCam Instrument Overview It is connected to the ISIM by struts and thermal straps connect to heat radiators, which helps maintain its temperature. The Focal Plane Electronics operated at 290 kelvin. NIRCam should be able to observe as faint as magnitude +29 with a 10000-second exposure (about 2.8 hours). It makes these observations in light from 0.6 (600 nm) to 5 microns (5000 nm) wavelength. It can observe in two fields of view, and either side can do imaging, or from the capabilities of the wave-front sensing equipment, spectroscopy. The wavefront sensing is much finer than the thickness of an average human hair. It must perform at an accuracy of at least 93 nanometers and in testing it has even achieved between 32 and 52 nm. A human hair is thousands of nanometers across. Main =Components= NIRCam Engineering Test Unit, showing some of the internal optics of NIRCam such as the collimating lenses and the mirrors Wavefront sensor components include: *Dispersed Hartmann sensors *Grisms *Weak lenses Parts of NIRCam: *Pick-off mirror *Coronograph *First-fold mirror *Collimator lenses *Dichroic beam splitter *Longwave filter wheel *Longwave camera lens group *Longwave focal plane *Shortwave filter wheel assembly *Shortwave camera lens group *Shortwave fold mirror *Pupil imaging lens *Shortwave focal plane =Overview= Infographic of JWST instruments and their observation ranges of light by wavelength NIRCam has two complete optical systems for redundancy. The two sides can operate at the same time, and view two separate patches of sky; the two sides are called side A and side B. The lenses used in the internal optics are triplet refractors. The lens materials are lithium fluoride (LiF), a barium fluoride (BaF2) and zinc selenide (ZnSe). The triplet lenses are collimating optics. The biggest lens has 90 mm of clear aperture. The observed wavelength range is broken up into a short wavelength and a long wavelength band. The short wavelength band goes from 0.6 to 2.3 microns and the long wavelength band goes from 2.4 to 5 microns; both have the same field of view and access to a coronagraph. Each side of the NIRCam views a 2.2 arcminute by 2.2 arcminute patch of sky in both the short and long wavelengths; however, the short wavelength arm has twice the resolution. The long wavelength arm has one array per side (two overall), and the short wavelength arm has four arrays per side, or 8 overall. Side A and Side B have a unique field of view, but they are adjacent to each other. In other words, the camera looks at two 2.2 arcminute wide fields of view that are next to each other, and each of these views is observed at short and long wavelengths simultaneously with the short wavelength arm having twice the resolution of the longer wavelength arm. The builders of NIRCam are the University of Arizona and company Lockheed Martin, in cooperation with the U.S. Space agency, NASA. NIRCam was completed in July 2013 and it was shipped to Goddard Spaceflight Center, which is the NASA center managing the JWST project. NIRCam's four major science goals include: Electronics NIRCam Focal Plane Assembly (FPA) undergoing inspection, 2013 Data from the image sensors (Focal Plane Arrays) is collected by the Focal Plane Electronics and sent to the ISIM computer. The data between the FPE and the ISIM computer is transferred by SpaceWire connection. There are also Instrument Control Electronics (ICE). The Focal Plane Arrays contain 40 million pixels. The FPE provides or monitors the following for the FPA: *Regulated power *Output data synchronization *Temperature control *Operational mode controls *Image data conditioning *Image data amplification *Image data digitization Filters NIRcam includes filter wheels that allow the light coming in from the optics to be sent through a filter before it is recorded by the sensors. The filters have a certain range in which they allow light to pass, blocking the other frequencies; this allows operators of NIRCam some control over what frequencies are observed when making an observation with the telescope. By using multiple filters the redshift of distant galaxies can be estimated by photometry.

Founded in the 15th century, the Shemokmedi monastery functioned as a seat of a bishopric and burial ground of the Gurieli princely dynasty. It was a safe-house of church treasures and, over the centuries, had accumulated an extensive collection of various objects from other Georgian monasteries. Parts of the collection, which survived the 19th-century robbers, are now on display in Georgia's museums.  Architecture  The Shemokmedi monastery consists of two architecturally simple churches‚Äîthose of the Redeemer and the Transfiguration otherwise known as Zarzma. The third structure, a bell tower, is built upon the fence of the monastery. This complex is located on a small hill on the left bank of the Bzhuzhi river, overlooking the village of Shemokmedi. The church of the Redeemer is a three-nave basilica with the dimensions of 10 √ó 13 m. It is an ashlar structure, lined with bluestone, and with a white marble floor. An ornate curving follows the contour of a window on the western fa√ßade. The interior was once entirely frescoed. The surviving fragments depict Mamia II Gurieli (died 1627), Prince of Guria, and his wife Tinatin, with respective identifying inscriptions in Georgian. The church of the Transfiguration was constructed at the behest of Prince Vakhtang I Gurieli in the late 1570s to house the venerated 9th-century Icon of the Transfiguration of Jesus rescued from the Zarzma Monastery in the Ottoman-occupied Principality of Samtskhe; hence comes the other name of the church, \\"Zarzma\\". This church is smaller than that of the Redeemer, with the dimensions of 9 √ó 7 m. It is a single-nave design crowned with an octagonal dome. The edifice is lined with brick and ashlar. Fragments of Georgian and Greek inscriptions as well as fresco depiction of the first bishop of Shemokmedi, Besarion Machutadze, survive on walls. A bell-tower built upon the church fence was originally constructed in the 16th century and renovated in 1831. All structures of the complex bare traces of multiple reconstructions. Northeast of the Shemokmedi monastery, at a distance of some 1.5 km, on the right bank of the Bzhuzhi, is the recently restored Gorisperdi church. Ornate fragments from the earlier, ruined medieval structure are found in the churchyard.  History  The Shemokmedi monastery in an illustration from Marie-Fr√©d√©ric Dubois de Montp√©reux's travelogue in the 1830s. The Shemokmedi Monastery was founded in the 15th century as a seat of one of the three bishoprics of the Principality of Guria, the other two being Jumati and Khino. Local prelates bore the rank of archbishop or metropolitan bishop and the epithet of Shemokmedeli. At the same time, the monastery served as a burial ground to the Gurieli princely dynasty. The surviving tombs belong to Rostom Gurieli (died 1564) and Mamia III Gurieli (died 1714). After the death of Metropolitan Bishop Ioseb Takaishvili in 1794, the Shemokmedi sea became dormant; the bishop of Jumati became a titular Shemokmedeli, while the monastery and its possessions passed to Kaikhosro Gurieli, an influential member of the ruling dynasty of Guria, who eventually lost his estates for leading an insurrection against the Russian Empire in 1820. During the conflict, Shemokmedi was stormed by the Russian troops, its fortifications were demolished and environs devastated. The Shemokmedi monastery was reinstated as a bishopric see, uniting the parishes of Batumi and Shemokmedi, in 1920. The Shemokmedi Diocese was as a separate eparchy was reestablished in 1995. Currently, its jurisdiction extends to all Orthodox churches in all three municipalities of Guria‚ÄîOzurgeti, Lanchkhuti, and Chokhatauri. The incumbent Catholicos Patriarch of Georgia Ilia II served as Bishop of Shemokmedi from 1963 to 1967.  Collections  Antiquities at the Shemokmedi monastery from Kondakov's catalogue of Georgian church collections (1890). Over centuries, the Shemokmedi cathedral became a safe-house of ecclesiastic treasures and accumulated a large collection of various religious objects and manuscripts from other churches and monasteries of Georgia. In 1873, the church was visited and the first scholarly description of its collection was compiled by Dimitri Bakradze. Subsequently, the monastery was subjected to a series of robberies. The surviving treasures were catalogued by Nikodim Kondakov on his visit to the monastery in 1889. Since 1924, most of the extant items have been in the collections of the Georgian National Museum.

It protects an area of annually flooded cerrado in the transition to Amazon rainforest, and is rich in biodiversity. Location The Araguaia State Park is in the municipality of Novo Santo Ant√¥nio, Mato Grosso. It has an area of . It borders the municipalities of S√£o F√©lix do Araguaia and Ribeir√£o Cascalheira, and the state of Tocantins. It is the southernmost part of the continuum of protected areas that extend along the right bank of the Araguaia River in Mato Grosso. It is in the Araguaia basin between the Araguaia and its tributary the Rio das Mortes. History From the 1970s, driven by tax incentives, the state of Mato Grosso has converted huge areas of Amazon and cerrado forest into large-scale agro-pastoral systems. Most of the unoccupied land was in remote, inaccessible and protected areas. The types of protected land depend on land use. Thus 83.77% of permanently flooded land is protected, while only 3.87% of open treed savanna is protected. The Araguaia State Park was created by law 7.517 of 28 September 2001 with an area of about . The objectives were to protect water resources, allow movement of native fauna, preserve a representative sample of ecosystems in the area and support controlled public use, education and scientific research. It was to be administered by the State Environment Foundation (FEMA). The park was classed as IUCN protected area category II (national park). At time of creation five years maximum were allowed for FEMA to prepare a management plan. The park was modified by law 8.458 of 17 January 2006. The management plan was published in 2007. It was approved in December 2008. On 27 June 2011 the state government published a law authorizing an \\"exchange\\" with the Funda√ß√£o Nacional do √çndio (Funai) that would bring the Xavante people of the Maraiwatsede Indigenous Territory (TI) into the park, and regularize ownership by squatters in the TI. Funai responded that it had no interest in the exchange, which was unconstitutional since indigenous territory is inalienable. Environment The vegetation is in the transition between Amazon rainforest and the cerrado, which results in a high level of biodiversity. The park is flooded annually. Typical Amazon forest fauna include the robust capuchin monkey and howler monkey. Fauna of the cerrado include maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus) and pampas deer (Ozotoceros bezoarticus). Wetland fauna include marsh deer (Blastocerus dichotomus) and capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris). The park is also home to aquatic animals such as Amazon river dolphin (Inia geoffrensis), giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis) and turtles.

It is a part of the Evangeline Parish School Board. History The school first began in 1908. Jer√© Longman of The New York Times wrote that the facilities began to deteriorate after racial integration occurred in 1969. By 2008 the school received upgrades to its computer laboratory and library and a new metal roof, along with other items within $2.4 million with of repairs and improvements. In 2008 the school had about 400 students. That year Longman stated that the classrooms were \\"no longer considered safe\\". \\\\- Print: page B12, New York edition, title: \\"The Last Hurrah?\\" The State of Louisiana had given the school failing marks, and under No Child Left Behind it was considered failing. On November 4, 2008 Evangeline Parish voters opted not to accept a property tax increase that would construct a new facility for the school. The United States Justice Department accused the parish's remodeling efforts of being inadequate and sought the school's closure. Toni Hamlin, the superintendent of the parish school system, argued that the district had completed the renovations mandated by the 2004 federal school reorganization plan.

Description and history The town of Barnet was settled in the 1770s by a group of Scottish immigrants from Perth and Stirling. The first Presbyterian church was built near the town's geographic center on a rise above the Stevens River, and became the focal point for the town's civic life. That first building, started in 1787 and completed in 1800, was replaced by a brick church which burned in 1849. The present Greek Revival church was built on its site the same year. The cemetery was formally established in 1791, the same year that the Cape style house of Reverend David Goodwillie was completed. This house is the second-oldest surviving building in the town. About 1830, Rev. Thomas Goodwillie built the church parsonage, and in 1898 the church vestry was added. At the southern end of the cemetery, a small wood-frame building was added about 1915 to house tools and equipment. with The district is bounded on the south by the Stevens River and West Barnet Road, and on the west by Barnet Center Road.

Biography Davies was born in Washington, Connecticut. His father was a County Sheriff or County Judge. During Davies' early years, the family moved to St Lawrence County, New York, where he was educated in local schools. He entered the US Military Academy at West Point in December 1813, through the influence of General Joseph Swift, who had met Davies' father during the War of 1812. Davies had earned praise for the services rendered to General James Wilkinson's army in the Descent of the St. Lawerence during the fall of 1813. Having been brought up on the frontier, Davies had had little formal education, but he had no difficulty in pursuing the courses at the academy. He graduated from the academy in December 1815. He joined the Light Artillery as a Bvt. Second Lieut. on December 11, 1815. He served a year in garrison at New England posts till August 31, 1816, when he was transferred to the Corps of Engineers. He resigned from the Army on December 1, 1816 and took a post as Assistant Professor of Mathematics at West Point. He became a Professor in May 1823. Davies resigned from West Point in May 1837. From 1839 till 1841, he was a professor at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, wherein he established a connection with Alfred Smith Barnes for publication of his books. He resigned from this position due to illness. He was reappointed in the army as a paymaster in November 1841, and was the Treasurer at West Point from December 11, 1841, to December 19, 1846. In 1848, he joined the New York University as a Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy. Upon his retirement a year later, he was conferred the degree of Doctor of Law from Geneva College, New York. Davies had chosen to retire to devote more time in writing textbooks. After a brief teaching stint at the Normal School in Albany, New York, he accepted a position at Columbia College, New York City in 1857 and was appointed as emeritus professor in 1865. He died on September 17, 1878. He was engaged with authoring textbooks till his death. He was buried in the family cemetery at Oswegatchie, New York. Works Charles Davies' books were published by A.S. Barnes & Co. His earliest works were translations of French authors. But according to author John H. Lienhard, those books were based only very loosely upon the original French works. Elements of Geometry and Trigonometry (1828), his most popular work, appeared in 33 editions/printings and sold more than 300,000 copies. By 1875, his publisher had sold over 7,000,000 copies of his books and was selling 350,000 copies every year. Mathematical historian Florian Cajori wrote of his books as being \\"perspicuous, clear, and logically arranged.\\" The following works by Davies were used as textbooks at West Point: *Elements of Descriptive Geometry, with Their Application to Spherical Trigonometry, Spherical Projections, and Warped Surfaces (1826) *Elements of Geometry and Trigonometry (1828), translated from the French of A. M. Legendre, by David Brewster.

He became famous for defeating multiple members of the Kodokan in challenge matches, and came to be considered one of the greatest modern jujutsuka. Biography =Early years= Tanabe was born in Okayama to Torajiro Tanabe, head of the Fusen-ry≈´ founded by Motsugai Takeda. He started training in jujutsu at 9 years old, and at 14 he started accompanying his father to competitions and challenges, often fighting grown-up men and much heavier opponents. At 17 he received his menkyo kaiden, and he and his father became teachers of their art around the country. Over the years, he devised a personal strategy of enduring his enemies' holds long enough to get them tired, and then coming back and making them submit with chokes and joint locks. He defined his style as devised by \\"practicing catching eels in his bare hands and watching snakes swallow frogs.\\" His main field of strength was ne-waza, being nicknamed and for his mastery of ground techniques. However, contrary to popular belief, he was also equally skilled in tachi-waza,Takeshi Kuroda, Mei Senshu Monogatari #8: Tanabe Mataemon, Modern Judo magazine, 20 June 1980 to the extent he was described as \\"at the level of a judo 4th dan\\" later in his life. =First challenges= In 1890, Tanabe travelled to Tokyo, where he was appointed hand-to-hand instructor of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department under the recommendation of Senjuro Kanaya of the Takenouchi-ry≈´ school. Here he trained with him and other Takenouchi-ry≈´ masters like Kotaro Imai and Hikosaburo Oshima. It would be in January 1891, however, when he became famous due to a challenge fight against a fellow police instructor, 3rd dan Kodokan Judoka and former Tenjin Shin'y≈ç-ry≈´ exponent Takisaburo Tobari. The fight happened at the Hisamatsu police station and was refereed by Kanaya. During the match, Tanabe reversed an osoto makikomi attempt by Tobari, and after pinning him with kami-shiho-gatame he choked him unconscious by juji-jime choke.Â§ñÁ∑®Ôºí‚àíÂè§ÊµÅ„Å®Ë¨õÈÅìÈ§®ÊµÅ Kainan Shimomura, Henri Pl√©e's Revue Judo Kodokan, September 1952 The match was the hardest defeat suffered by the Kodokan school against a jujutsu challenger, and it was soon made public that Tanabe had found the Kodokan style's weak point thanks to his dexterity at groundfighting. In spring 1892, Tanabe was challenged to a rematch by Tobari in an event hosted by the Tokyo police department, again with Kanaya as the referee. Although the judoka came with improved skills and managed to block Tanabe's first tomoe nage attempt, he made the mistake to try to engage him voluntarily on the ground. Thanks to Tanabe's defense and patience, Tobari exhausted himself trying to submit him, allowing Mataemon to place him lying flat on the mat and choke him again by juji-jime. After those bouts, Tanabe appeared in the Osaka branch of the Kodokan at the kagami-biraki annual event and challenged Jigoro Kano personally, without receiving an answer. He would face more judokas after this bout, among them Yoshitsugu Yamashita, Kunisaburo Iizuka, Norimasu Iwasaki, Yuji Hirooka and Shichigoro Baba, defeating them all.Christian Quidet, La fabuleuse histoire des Arts Martiaux His victory over Yamashita was particularly sound, as he also challenged the rest of the K≈çd≈çkan Shitenn≈ç, but both Sakujiro Yokoyama and Tsunejiro Tomita rejected the offer. Only Shiro Saigo accepted, but the match never happened due to undisclosed reasons. The rivalry with Tobari didn't end without a third match, celebrated in December at Kanda Izumi-cho police station. Before the fight, Tobari would have a physical altercation with another fighter, Senjuro Kanaya himself, as Tobari had challenged both him and Tanabe the same day. This offended Kanaya, who fought Tobari, both men ending up worn and battered. The match started the same way as the previous one, but this time Tanabe countered a throw attempt and scored fully his tomoe nage, following up by pinning Tobari and applying ebi-jime for the victory.Cesare Barioli, L‚ÄôAvventure del Judo, Corpo Mente Cuore =At the Butoku Kai= Tanabe (standing, sixth from left to right) among the jujutsu masters at the Butoku Kai After those fights, Tanabe's renown was such that he was one of the twenty representing masters chosen in 1895 to open up the jujutsu division at the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai, an idea promoted by Kodokan founder Jigoro Kano. Tanabe taught at the Butokukai for a long time, and also competed against martial artists from other styles. His favourite place, however, was the dojo of Yataro Handa in Dojima, Osaka, which he visited for the first time in 1898, a year after it was opened. Handa was a master of Daito-ry≈´ (actually a filial of Sekiguchi-ry≈´; not to be confused with the late style Dait≈ç-ry≈´ Aiki- j≈´jutsu),Sekiguchi-ry≈´Relation between Daito and Sekiguchi as well as Tenjin Shinyo-ry≈´.Yukimitsu Kano, Judo Daijiten, 1984 Knowing Tanabe's reputation, Handa introduced him to Soji Kimotsuki, a former student of his who had joined Kodokan, and the two fought a match. It would to be the first time Tanabe lost a bout against a judoka, as Kimotsuki threw him on his head with deashi barai and knocked him out. The Fusen-ry≈´ master got his retribution the next day by sitting on the mat and goading Kimotsuki to meet him on the ground, where he choked him out (according to another version, Tanabe reversed an uchi mata with a kuchiki taoshi to pull Kimotsuki to the mat). After those matches, Tanabe and Kimotsuki became friends and training partners, and Mataemon became also a usual teacher in Handa's dojo. Also in 1898, Tanabe was involved in an exhibition fight in front of Emperor Taish≈ç in Kyoto, going against Kasumi Shin-ry≈´ jujutsuka and 3rd dan judoka Yuji Hirooka in a rematch of a past challenge fight. After half an hour of fighting both on their feet and on the tatami, Tanabe scored a morote gari and applied an ashi garami (Ë∂≥Êå´, an ancient name for the ashi hishigi). Although Hirooka surrendered, it was too late, and his leg was broken. At the next reunion at the Butoku Kai, in 1899, Kano proposed to forbid leglocks from regular jujutsu/judo competitions due to the possibility of lasting damage. Tanabe objected, noting that the entire martial art could be considered dangerous as well; however, out of all the masters of traditional jujutsu gathered, only Kaisuke Masuda from Shinnuki-ry≈´ agreed with Tanabe, and thus the ban was decided by majority. Still, Tanabe pressed to have one of his favourite leglock variations (Ë∂≥Á∑ò, the current canonical ashi garami) included in the Kodokan katame-no-kata. This ban would cost Tanabe a victory over 3rd dan judoka Hajime Isogai, whom he fought in Kyoto in 1899 under referee Masaaki Samura from Takeuchi Santo-ry≈´.Raisuke Kudo, Isogai Hajime no Maki: Mataemon no Gajo ni Kirikon da Isogai, Tokyo Sports, 25 May 1973 Tanabe attempted his signature tomoe nage, but Isogai blocked it. At that moment Mataemon would have followed with ashi garami, but under the new rules he couldn't do it legally, so he was forced to allow Isogai to crouch down. Isogai defended until the end of the time, ending the bout as a draw. Shortly after, he would fight another Kodokan judoka, the regarded Shuichi Nagaoka, fighting to another draw; Tanabe almost locked a juji-gatame at one point, but his body got out of the tatami bounds and the match was restarted, which helped Nagaoka to defend until the end. Mataemon then rematched Isogai in Fukuoka, but this time Tanabe was unable to take the fight to the ground and was repeatedly threatened by Isogai's mastery with the hane goshi. The match was ultimately declared a draw again. =Last matches= In May 1900, Tanabe had his third and last match against Hajime Isogai, challenging him to an event that was going to take place in Okayama, Mataemon's land. The bout would be refereed by Kotaro Imai, Takenouchi-ry≈´ exponent and Isogai's personal enemy. However, this time Isogai had trained with Kaichiro Samura, a ground expert judoka originally from Takenouchi Santo-ry≈´ (as well as the elder son of the aforementioned Masaaki Samura), and had greatly improved his ne-waza skills. After a lengthy ground battle in which Isogai gradually started to dominate, Mataemon reportedly tried to drag them both out of the tatami zone in order to force a restart, but Isogai dragged them back while the crowd cried for a tie. At the end, Imai stopped the fight and declared a draw. Tanabe claimed to be suffering from hemorrhoids to explain his performance, though he also commended Isogai's effort. According to Tsunetane Oda, Mataemon had his last great fight in his career when he finally faced Sakujiro Yokoyama. Tanabe went originally to his dojo to perform a challenge, and he fought and defeated several of his students, making them submit with juji- gatame. When it came to Yokoyama to fight him, Tanabe tried to perform his usual ground techniques, but his much bigger opponent managed to block them. They returned to standing, and at that moment Yokoyama executed a yoko-sutemi- waza technique with the help of his superior weight. The move was hard enough to leave Tanabe unable to continue the match, and Yokoyama was declared winner.Tsunetane Oda, Judo Manabu Hito no Tame ni, 1950 Tanabe always declined to officially join the Kodokan school, but it's known that he was friends and usual training partners with judokas Yuji Hirooka and Soji Kimotsuki. It is also possible, but not proven, that he was directly hired by Jigoro Kano to teach his ne-waza style in the Kodokan.Judo History 8 He was appointed judo kyoshi in 1906, teaching at the Butoku Kai until his retirement in 1922, and was promoted to hanshi in 1927. Tanabe died in 1942 in Osaka. Years after his death, his career was praised by judo historian Takeshi Kuroda, who called him \\"the last great jujutsuka\\" and a figure of utmost importance for the history of Kodokan. He was the inspiration for the character Gennosuke Higaki in Tsuneo Tomita's popular novel series Sanshiro Sugata. His son Teruo later joined the Kodokan, placing second at the 1931 All Japan Judo Championships after Shuzan Takahashi and eventually reaching the 8¬∫ dan.

The Hippodrome was located in downtown Toronto, at the northwest corner of Queen and Bay streets (now Nathan Phillips Square). At its opening in 1914, it was the largest movie palace in Canada, and one of the largest vaudeville theatres in the world. The Hippodrome included 12 opera boxes, a Wurlitzer organ, as well as a full-size orchestra pit. It debuted some of Canada's first non-silent films. It was built by brothers Jerry and Michael Shea and situated directly across from Toronto's (now former) City Hall. The Hippodrome was operated by Famous Players and managed for decades by Ken Bishop. It was demolished in 1957 to make way for Toronto's new City Hall.lostToronto Venue Prior to building Shea's Hippodrome, the Shea brothers first took over and operated the former Robinson's Musee Theatre (also known as the \\"Bijou\\") as \\"Shea's Yonge Street\\" (also known as the \\"Strand\\") in 1899. The brothers then built \\"Shea's Victoria\\" nearby.urbantoronto.ca Shea's Hippodrome was constructed in the Renaissance style, with arched (and 'electrified') ceilings. The theatre featured an allegorical painting by George Brant, and uniquely included a coin-operated candy dispenser. Historically, a hippodrome is a large, circular ancient Greek theatre. Though Shea's Hippodrome was not round, the word was sometimes adopted for large theatres at the time. Before installing a Wurlitzer organ in 1926,Memories of Toronto‚Äôs Shea‚Äôs Hippodrome Theatre Shea's included an Orchestron machine, a punch-tape programmed precursor to a modern synthesizer. House organists included Kathleen Stokes, Colin Corbett, Quentin Maclean and Al Bollington. Vaudeville 'The Hipp' was on the Family Time, and later the Super Time, vaudeville circuits. It hosted many of the world's greatest vaudeville acts, including:theatreorgans.com * Bob Hope * Edgar Bergen * George Burns * Gracie Allen * Red Skelton * Bennie Fields * Blossom Seeley * Jimmy Durante * Ben Blue * Helen Kane * Jack Benny * Maurice Chevalier * Fanny Brice * Burns & Allen * George Jessel * Guy Lombardo * Cab Calloway Talkies In 1924, Shea's debuted its first 'talkie' ‚Äì a non-silent film, called a 'phonofilm'. The first talkie was called The Studio Murder Mystery. Originally thought to be a novelty, talkies later became the main source of income for supporting the declining vaudeville revenue. Over the years, Shea's screened films such as The Ten Commandments and many of Elvis Presley's movies. In 1941, the Abbott and Costello film Buck Privates played for a record 14 weeks. Closing Shea's Hippodrome was one of the last remaining vaudeville theatres in North America to remain open after World War II. The theatre closed just after Christmas in 1957. The last film to play at Shea's was Elvis Presley's Loving You. The Wurlitzer organ was sold to Maple Leaf Gardens (and later sold to Casa Loma). Though closed, the building was not demolished for some time, and Toronto's replacement 'civic center' was not completed until 1965.

It was launched in response to the government's defeat in the judicial review case against the Central and Wan Chai Reclamation projects.  Background and history  Victoria Harbour, one of the most precious natural assets of Hong Kong, has long been playing an important role to Hong Kong, in terms of strategies, economy, infrastructure, and culture. The population of Hong Kong expanded rapidly in different periods. Therefore, the shortage of the land has always been an issue of the city, and harbour reclamation has been a preferred solution of it. By 1990, 2,500 hectares, more than one-third of the harbour (the original area was about 7,000 hectares), had been reclaimed. Moreover, the Metroplan published by the colonial government planned to reclaim another 1,297 hectares, which would lead to the loss of about half of the harbour in total. 661 hectares of the planned reclamation were completed, before the Protection of the Harbour Ordinance came into stage in 1997. In the 1980s, harbour reclamation was accelerated in a high speed. Both economic development and improving the infrastructure of the city demanded a large amount of land. Other than the fact that there was a shortage of land coupled with a huge population, the sea reclamation policy had been used as a tool to boost ‚Äúeconomic development and the commoditization of land‚Äù. These harbour-reclaimed land are usually located at the core areas of the city, which made it worth a higher price. Besides, upon reclamation, it could avoid confronting with local residents. In comparison to harbour reclamation, redevelopment of built-up areas was not the first choice of solving the shortage of land for the government. Some critics pointed out that, harbour reclamation was not a sustainable way for the development of Hong Kong‚Äîthe waterway transportation would be impeded, and the quality of water would be damaged. However, before the 1990s, few people paid their attention to negative effects of harbour reclamation, and the economic interest was always the first priority for the colonial government. In the 1990s, a massive reclamation plan was introduced. Winston Chu, a member of the Town Planning Board, set up the Society for Protection of the Harbour (‚ÄúSPH‚Äù) in 1995. He was dissatisfied with ‚Äúthe massive reclamation but also by the entire process of executive-led planning‚Äù. In the last two years of the British rule, SPH successfully drew public attention to the government‚Äôs harbour reclamation proposals. Hence, more and more people were willing to speak out for going against the harbour reclamation. As to the Central and Wan Chai Reclamation projects, property developers, as well as professional bodies opposed the project. The first time in 1998, a large exhibition was held, collecting opinions from the public, for opposing the reclamation projects. All these were reflected in the legislature‚Äîthe chairlady declared to amend the Protection of the Harbour Ordinance, the restriction on reclamation was expended. In February 2003, SPH initiated judicial review (\\"JR\\") proceedings against the Town Planning Board‚Äôs (‚ÄúTPB‚Äù) decision in respect of the draft Wan Chai North Outline Zoning Plan (‚ÄúOZP‚Äù) No. S/H25/1. The High Court delivered its judgment on the JR case, laying down the \\"three tests\\" to be applied to rebut the presumption against reclamation under section 3 of the Protection of the Harbour Ordinance in July. In the next month, TPB applied to Court of Final Appeal (‚ÄúCFA‚Äù) for leave for the appeal case. Finally, in January 2004, the CFA handed down its judgment dismissing TPB's appeal against the High Court ruling on the draft Wan Chai North OZP, but substituting the High Court's \\"three test\\" by a \\"single overriding public need test\\". SPH was the first organization set up for preserve the harbour in 1995. After that, different groups, and organizations put their effort on harbour protecting, such as Central-Wan Chai Reclamation Study Group (1998), Save Our Shorelines (1999), Action Group on Protection of the Harbour (2003), Friends of the Harbour (2003), Designing Hong Kong Harbour District (2003), Citizen Envisioning@Harbour (CE@H) (2003), and Harbour Business Forum. They have successfully launched a social movement.  Civic engagement process  = The Harbourfront Enhancement Committee = In the aftermath of the judicial review against the Wan Chai development project, the government was urged by the community to establish a committee composed of representatives from different sectors to explore the future development of the Victoria Harbour. As a result, the government decided to engage the public to reformulate the reclamation plans whilst ensuring full compliance with the Court of Final Appeal‚Äôs requirement of ‚Äúoverriding public need‚Äù. The Harbourfront Enhancement Committee (‚ÄúHEC‚Äù) was established in May 2004, which aims at safeguarding public enjoyment of the harbour through public participation guided by principles of sustainable development. The HEC was considered an innovative institution for a number of reasons. Firstly, it was no longer led by a government official, with Professor Chack-fan Lee, a senior engineering scholar from the University of Hong Kong being the chairperson. In addition, the composition of HEC entails government officials, the private sector, and civil society organisations, with organisations being invited to directly nominate their representatives to the Committee. Both the SPH and CE@H had appointed their representatives, while other corporate members are major professional groups and environmental groups. In essence, most of the important stakeholders of harbour protection have been included. Further, all meetings would proceed in an open manner with the minutes available to the public on the internet. Indeed, the government has accepted social demand to preserve the harbour as a collective asset of Hong Kong. As reflected by the terms of reference, the role of the HEC includes protecting the harbour, improving the utilisation of harbourfront areas and safeguarding public enjoyment by means of public participation. Principles of sustainable development would be adopted when planning future land uses and development projects. A number of subcommittees were further established under the HEC. In particular, the Subcommittee on Harbour Plan Review formulated the Harbour Planning Principles, which designated the vision of harbour planning as enhancing the harbourfront areas to become ‚Äúan attractive, vibrant, accessible and sustainable world-class asset‚Äù. Some of the principles are of particular relevance to civic engagement and public enjoyment. For example, the principle for ‚Äòpreserving Victoria Harbour‚Äô suggests that the harbour must be protected as special public asset, natural and cultural heritage asset so as to stimulate economic and social values. More importantly, the principle of ‚Äòstakeholder engagement‚Äô stipulates that in the course of planning and development of the harbour, all sectors must be engaged both at an initial stage and on an ongoing basis to achieve consensus. The aforesaid principles upheld by the HEC, in fact, demonstrates the core values for harbour protection and development - namely to preserve and enhance the public asset nature as well as the cultural and leisure value of the Victoria Harbour. As for the economic aspect, it is more focused on strengthening the international attractiveness of Hong Kong by means of harbour development. In this connection, it seems that the traditional and longstanding policy of creating new land for urban development through reclamation no longer prevails in this century. = Public engagement mechanisms = The HEC developed a participatory planning model for creating an effective partnership between the Government and the civil society. The said strategy underlines the importance of achieving broad consensus, especially when reaching landmark decisions concerning the development for the harbourfront. More importantly, the Harbour-front Enhancement Review includes three stages: the Envisioning Stage, the Realization Stage and the Detailed Planning Stage. In the envisioning stage, the collaborators were offered the opportunity to formulate the central principles and to give their visions for the harbourfront developments, with an aim to provide a solid basis for the future endorsements of the Concept Plan and the Master Plan. To accomplish the aforementioned objectives, the concerned stakeholders and the general public were encouraged to express their concerns in the public forums and the community charrettes in 2005. Concerns in a number of issues such as transportation and urban design principles were expressed. Opinion surveys, telephone surveys, and written submissions were also employed in order to give the envisioning stage extensive coverage. Further, a consolidation forum and parallel discussions were also held with the members of the District Council, the Legislative Council and the Town Planning Board. In the realization stage, the public was involved in an array of consultation activities for the purpose of eliciting opinions on the proposed Concept Plan. For instance, two sessions of Community Workshops and Harbour Walks were organised in 2006 respectively.Panel on Planning, Lands and Works, Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.

It is worth mentioning that a public briefing was taken place in 2007 for the public to air their opinions on the RODP and the OZPs. In conclusion, the HEC had made sustained effort in encouraging more public participation in the harbourfront scheme, and stimulated an open and transparent process for engaging all relevant parties. = Institutionalisation of harbourfront development = In December 2007, a Task Group on Management Model for the Harbourfront was established to bring forward the proposal concerning the institutional framework. In response to the recommendations of the Task Group, the Harbourfront Commission was established as a standing advisory body.  Strengths and weaknesses  = Positive achievements =  Representativeness of HEC membership  The HEC is chaired by a senior engineering professor and Pro-Vice Chancellor from HKU. The chair of the HEC succeeded in getting cooperation and support from the government, contributing to the success of planning review of Central and Wanchai harbour front. It shows the public that the government allows expertise input rather than controlling the agenda. Unofficial members include citizens from various background, such as geography professor and property consultants. Besides, HEC provides for corporate representation. That means it invites organisations to appoint their own representatives to the HEC. For instance, Citizen Envisioning@Harbour, Business Environment Council and Friends of the Earth. Corporate representation can have more bargaining power against government policies because the representatives represent the body as a whole. Moreover, both SPH and CE@H have representations in the Committee, though they are usually confronted on government harbour reclamation plan.  Government- civil society synergy  The government allowed the HEC to conduct civic engagement activities. This can build trust and confidence among participants and raise the legitimacy of the final Outline Zoning Plan of the Wanchai North Reclamation. High degree of transparency allows wide public monitoring. All meetings are open to the public and all the minutes and related documents can be accessed by the public. Besides, civic engagement promotes public participation and social learning on the parts of government officials because different activities, such as interview, workshops and exhibitions, are organized to engage the public. This promotes state-society synergy and exchange of ideas between the government and the public.  Other factors contributing to the success  First, there is a strong civil society. The civil society was led by professional and expertise who provided solid and knowledge based discourse to counter government proposed policy. They offered an alternative policy that could have less reclamation. The civic engagement was indeed a direct result of societal mobilization and civil society activism played a strong role in shaping engagement process. For instance, the illegitimate government policies due to the judicial review forced the government to engage the public. Also, SPH organised the ‚ÄúBlue Ribbon Movement‚Äù in 2004 which attracted more than 10,000 citizens to participate. This showed the government that citizens were determined to protect the harbour. The use of cultural symbols and collective identity impressed the public to participate in the harbour protection movement and convert the issue into majoritarian politics. The concept of civic engagement was introduced by the CE@H to the government. Later on, the model of civic engagement CE@H adopted became the blueprint for the government future civic engagement process. Second, the government agenda was opened to the public. The public can freely raise their opinions to the government. The chairman being an academic person also showed the public that the government would not like to dominate the policy-making process. This empowers citizens to consider they were able to influence the policy-making process, which enhances the efficiency of the civic engagement. Third, it was a breakthrough by the government in the planning of the usage of public space. The civic engagement process transcended the old one-way approach of consultation to a more interactive civic engagement process. This can minimize future government- civil society confrontation and smoothen the policy implementation. Public felt their opinions were taken into account, this can hold the government responsive and accountable. = Limitations =  HEC faced difficulties in agenda-setting  Even though the HEC aims at covering large areas concerning the harbour development, the government agenda was only keen on the reclamation of the Central and Wan Chai harbourfront. Also, the officials still retain the final power to exclude an item from discussion. Besides, HEC is only a non-statutory advisory committee, its suggestions are not legally binding, so the government may not implement the recommendations ultimately.  Perceived utilitarian attitude of the government  The government consulted the public mainly because it wanted the future reclamation plan get passed. From the very beginning, there was no mutual trust between the government and stakeholders. The participants complained that they need to put more effort in advocating government officials because officials usually would not follow their suggestions. For instance, some business and professional interviewees did to feel the government has taken into account their suggestions genuinely.  Dominance of the government  Even though the government re-opened the planning of Wanchai Reclamation Phase II, Central Reclamation Phase III was closed to public input. It may be because Central reclamation has high commercial value, therefore the government wants to retain control on the area. Also, since the Central reclamation plan was not quashed in the judicial review, the government would consider it unnecessary to engage the public.

A student and prot√©g√© of Metastasio, he was primarily active in the court theaters of Dresden and Vienna. His most successful work was the libretto for the opera Solimano, first set by Johann Adolph Hasse in 1753 and subsequently set by 18 other composers in the course of the next 50 years. Life and career Migliavacca was born in Milan around 1718, but the exact date of his birth as well as his parentage and early life are unknown. Much of the information about his life has come from Metastasio's letters.Hansell, Sven (2001). \\"Migliavacca, Giovanni Ambrogio\\". Grove Music Online. Retrieved 3 December 2016 (Subscription required for full access). Migliavacca's first appearance as a literary figure was in Milan in 1736, when at the age 18 he edited a collection of poetic tributes dedicated to the Duke of Noailles. Soon after, he became a member of the Accademia dei Filodossi and was active in the Milanese intellectual milieu of the Enlightenment. He initially opted for a career as a diplomat, working as the imperial secretary of the Italian legation to the court of Charles VII where he became a favourite of the emperor. After the death of Charles VII in 1745, Migliavacca saw little future in a diplomatic career and instead focused on his literary pursuits. He moved to Vienna and between 1748 and 1752 worked for Metastasio as a secretary, copyist, and later a collaborator on some of his texts. At the time, Metastasio was the court poet to Holy Roman Empress Maria Theresa. One of his duties was to supervise opera rehearsals and give directions to the singers. When Jommelli's Merope was to be performed in 1749, Metastasio delegated his directorial duties to Migliavacca. Tensions arising from a feud between two of the opera's star singers, Migliavacca's close friend Vittoria Tesi, and the castrato Caffarelli, and from Caffarelli's refusal to attend rehearsals reached a climax when he and Migliavacca fought a duel at Vittoria Tesi's house. However, her entreaties to the combatants ended the incipient sword fight before anyone was hurt.Guccini, Gerardo (2002). \\"Directing Opera\\" in L. Bianconi; G. Pestelli; K. Singleton (eds). Opera on Stage, p. 141. University of Chicago Press. Pietro Metastasio, Migliavacca's mentor Migliavacca made his debut as a librettist in his own right (albeit closely supervised by Metastasio) in 1750 with Armida placata, composed by and performed in Madrid to celebrate the marriage of Maria Antonia Ferdinanda of Spain and Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia. It was performed again in Vienna later that year in a pastiche version with music by several composers including Luca Antonio Predieri and Johann Adolph Hasse.Casaglia, Gherardo (2005). \\"Migliavacca\\". Almanacco Amadeus. Retrieved 4 December 2016 . Through Metastasio, Migliavacca had also become acquainted with Duchess Maria Antonia of Bavaria. She was the wife of Frederick Christian, heir to the thrones of Saxony and Poland, and was a patron of the arts as well as gifted composer, singer, and harpsichordist. Two of her operas, Il trionfo della fedelt√† and Talestri, have survived, but according to Bruno Brunelli, she had earlier composed a short opera (now lost) to a libretto by Migliavacca entitled Giove fulminatore dei giganti.Brunelli, Bruno (1951). Pietro Metastasio, Tutte le opere, Vol. 3 Lettere, p. 1225 (note). Mondadori In 1752, through the intervention of Metastasio, Migliavacca was appointed court poet and diplomatic counselor to Frederick Christian's father Frederick Augustus II. The following year, he produced what was to prove his most enduring work, the libretto for Hasse's opera Solimano.Caprioli, Leonella Grasso (2010). \\"Migliavacca, Giovanni Ambrogio\\". Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani, Vol. 74. Treccani. Online version retrieved 3 December 2016 . It premiered at the court theatre in Dresden in a spectacular production that included live elephants and camels and hundreds of extras in addition to the seven main singers. His libretto was subsequently set by 18 other composers and saw 36 separate productions over the next 50 years. In 1754 he produced the libretto for Hasse's next opera Artemisia and in 1755 adapted Metastasio's libretto for Hasse's Ezio. Like Solimano, Ezio was a lavish operatic spectacle which included a procession of 400 soldiers and over 100 horses from the royal stable.Yorke-Long, Alan (1954). Music at Court: Four Eighteenth Century Studies, p. 84. Weidenfeld and Nicolson When the 1756 Prussian invasion of Dresden severely curtailed the musical life of the court, Migliavacca worked in Vienna and then returned to Milan in 1765. During his sojourn in Milan he was instrumental in negotiating the Biblioteca Ambrosiana's acquisition of two valuable book collections belonging to the Clerici and Lambertenghi families. In 1780 Migliavacca was re-engaged as the poet of the court theatre in Dresden and was paid there regularly through 1795. The cessation of payments after that time without their conversion to a pension suggests that he died shortly after the end of that year. There are no records of the exact date or place of his death. His last known libretto from that period was La reggia d'Imeneo, a festa teatrale performed in Dresden in 1787 to celebrate the marriage of Anton of Saxony. The libretto printed for that performance still listed him as a diplomatic counselor to the Saxony court. Migliavacca's libretti were long ignored by later literary critics who dismissed them as the work of a semi-dilettante and mediocre imitator of Metastasio. However, in the late 20th century, he came to be appreciated as one of a group of reforming Italian librettists which also included Ranieri de' Calzabigi, Mattia Verazi, Giovanni de Gamerra, and Gaetano Martinelli. They moved away from the traditional Metasasian plot structures, increased the number of ensembles relative to solo arias, and organized the ballets, arias, and ensembles into integrated dramatic scenes rather than the series of showy arias which had previously characterised opera seria.Feldman, Martha (2010).

Its name is a pun of \\"mimic you\\", while also referencing Pikachu.  Design and characteristics  Mimikyu is a small Pok√©mon, standing only 8 inches tall, and is hidden almost entirely underneath a disguise. Its size makes it the smallest ghost type Pok√©mon as of Generation 8. It has beady black eyes which can be seen through its disguise, and a vague semblance of a foot or lower body can be seen at the hem of its disguise. It will occasionally extend a black appendage from beneath the disguise; the disguise has black eyes, red cheeks, a squiggly black mouth, a lightning bolt-shaped stick that resembles a tail, and ears that are colored black on the top. According to the official Pok√©mon website, Mimikyu is \\"dreadfully lonely\\", and in an effort to emulate the popularity of Pikachu, wears the Pikachu-like costume in order to make friends. Mimikyu is drawn to dark or dimly lit areas, and its health will decline if exposed to sunlight.

In Pok√©mon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon, Mimikyu was given an exclusive Z-move called Let's Snuggle Forever, a Fairy-type move that requires Mimikyu to know the move Play Rough and hold a Mimikium Z. This move can only be learned by Mimikyu. Mimikyu can be found on Ula‚Äôula Island in the Abandoned Thrifty Megamart. It is one of the Pok√© Ball Pok√©mon in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, which captures a fighter when summoned. Mimikyu also appears as a Spirit. If its Spirit is equipped, the fighter will start the match with Death's Scythe. Most recently, it appeared in Pok√©mon Sword and Shield, in Giant's Mirror, in heavy fog, but it has an exceptionally rare spawn rate of 3%. = In the anime = Mimikyu appears in the anime Pok√©mon: Sun & Moon, and is encountered by Jessie, James, and Meowth of Team Rocket.

The Pok√©mon Center has also released Mimikyu attire and a Gallery Figure of Mimikyu, featuring the Pok√©mon using Shadow Sneak.  Reception  Kotaku called Mimikyu \\"Game Freak‚Äôs most brilliant and heartbreaking Pok√©mon that they‚Äôve ever come up with\\", and noted Mimikyu's large Internet fan following. Catrina Dennis of Inverse also observed this following, writing that \\"a new, immediate obsession has begun to spread throughout the [Pok√©mon] fandom surrounding one addition [Mimikyu] that has pulled at players‚Äô heartstrings already\\". Janine Hawkins of Paste explained the online attention as being a result of the character's design, writing that \\"fans have embraced the creature expressly because of [its] overt vulnerability ... Mimikyu was designed to emotionally compel us, and they‚Äôve already been a huge success\\". Destructoid listed Mimikyu as one of its staff's favorite Alolan Pok√©mon, stating that it is \\"probably going to be the star of Gen VII for a lot of people\\".

He was a specialist stayer who recorded all of his major wins over distances of 3000 m or longer. He showed promise as a two-year-old when he won one minor race and was placed in both the Prix de Cond√© and the Crit√©rium de Saint-Cloud. In the following year, he developed into a high-class stayer, recording Group Three wins in the Prix de l'Esperance and Prix Berteux, as well as being placed in the Prix Greffulhe, Prix Hocquart, and Prix Royal-Oak. He reached his peak as a four-year-old in 1973, when he completed a rare double by winning both the Prix du Cadran and the Ascot Gold Cup before ending his season with a win in the Prix Gladiateur. He retained most of his ability as a five-year-old, when he was narrowly beaten in the Prix du Cadran and ran third in the Ascot Gold Cup. After his retirement from racing, he was exported to stand at stud in Japan, but had little success as a breeding stallion. Background Lassalle was a \\"strong, powerful\\" bay horse with a narrow white stripe bred in France by Louis Champion. As a yearling, he was sent to the sales at Deauville and was bought for ¬£23,000 by representatives of Zenya Yoshida, the Japanese founder of Shadai Farm. The colt was sent into training in France with Richard Carver Jr. Lassalle was from the first crop of foals sired by Bon Mot, the winner of the 1966 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. His dam Windy Cliff showed high-class form on the track, finishing second in the Prix Cl√©op√¢tre and became a successful broodmare whose other offspring included the steeplechaser Ravageur (Prix La Haye Jousselin). She was a granddaughter of Feola, a British broodmare foaled in 1926, who has been the female-line ancestor of numerous major winners including Pebbles, Deep Impact, Aureole, Nashwan, Jet Ski Lady, and Johannesburg. Racing career =1971: Two-year- old season= After winning a race over 1200 m on his racecourse debut, Lassalle was moved up in class and distance for the Prix de Cond√© at Longchamp Racecourse in October and finished third behind Relpin and Gay Saint. On his final run of the year, he contested the Crit√©rium de Saint-Cloud and came home third behind Gay Saint and Pardner. =1972: Three-year-old season= Lassalle began his second campaign by contesting some of the major trial races for the French Classic Races. In April, he finished third to Sancy in the Prix Greffulhe over 2100 m at Longchamp and fifth behind the same colt in the Prix Noailles over 2300 m at the same course. On 7 May, he started a 14/1 outsider for the 2400 metre Prix Hocquart and finished third behind Talleyrand and Exalte with Gay Saint in fourth. Rather than being aimed at the Prix du Jockey Club, Lassalle was stepped up in distance for the Prix de l'Esperance (the race now known as the Prix Chaudenay) over 3000 m at Longchamp and recorded his first major success as Jean-Claude Desaint rode him to victory in the Group Three event from Apollo Eight and Aristophane. At Chantilly Racecourse in June, he added another Group Three success over the same distance as he defeated Nubayr and Folkestone in the Prix Berteux. His form in staying races had him start second favourite for the Group One Grand Prix de Paris over 3100 m on 25 June, but he ran poorly and finished unplaced behind Pleben. After a lengthy break, Lassalle returned to the track in September for the Prix Royal- Oak over the Grand Prix de Paris course and distance. Ridden by Lester Piggott, he again found Pleben too good, but produced a much better effort, as he finished third, beaten three lengths by the winner. On his final appearance of the year, the colt was brought back in distance and matched against older horses in the Prix du Conseil Municipal over 2400 m at Longchamp in October, but made no impact and finished unplaced behind the six-year-old Monsieur D. =1973: Four-year-old season= On his first run as a four-year-old, Lassalle ran in the Prix de Barbeville over 3100 m and Longchamp and finished sixth behind Filandre. In the Prix Jean Prat over the same course and distance later that month, he started second favourite and looked the likely winner early in the straight before being overtaken in the closing and beaten easily by the British-trained five-year-old Parnell with Filandre and Pleben in third and fourth. After finishing fifth in his next start over 2400 m, the colt was moved up in distance for France's most prestigious long-distance race, the 4000-m Prix du Cadran at Longchamp on 20 May. Ridden by the British jockey Jimmy Lindley, he started the 2.7/1 second favourite in a six-runner field. In a slowly run race, Pleben was forced to make the running and refused to co- operate with his jockey, attempting to pull himself up and then bolting as the horses approached the final turn. Having been settled in second place by Lindley, Lassalle moved up to overtake the favourite early in the straight and drew away to win \\"comfortably\\" by three lengths. Lindley was again in the saddle when Lassalle was sent to England in June to contest the Gold Cup over two and a half miles on soft ground at Royal Ascot and started the 2/1 favourite. His six opponents included the dual Irish classic winner Pidget, Celtic Cone (Yorkshire Cup) and The Admiral (Henry II Stakes). The pacemaker Atout (ridden by Piggott) led the field into the straight before giving way to Celtic Cone. Lassalle, however, moved up to join Celtic Cove before drawing away to win by five lengths, with a gap of four lengths back to The Admiral in third. He became only the fourth horse to win the Prix du Cadran and the Gold Cup after Boiard (1874), Arbar (1948), and Levmoss (1969). Although Timeform acknowledged that the French colt had won in \\"grand style\\", they described the field as one of the poorest ever assembled for Britain's premier staying event. After an absence of well over 3 months, Lassalle ran in the 1973 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp on 7 October. Racing over an inadequate distance of 2400 m, he started a 99/1 outsider, but ran well to finish ninth of the 27 runners behind Rheingold. Three weeks after his run in the Arc, Lassalle returned to Longchamp for Europe's longest major flat race, the 4800-m (3-mi) Prix Gladiateur. He was made the 1.7/1 favourite ahead of Parnell, with the best of the other five runners appearing to be the six-year- old gelding Forceful. After moving up to challenge for the lead early in the straight, he finished second, beaten a \\"short neck\\" by Parnell with a gap of four lengths back to Forceful in third place. Parnell, however, had hung to the left in the straight, hampering both of his main rivals and the racecourse stewards relegated the British challenger to third, awarding the race to Lassalle. Timeform commented that the reports of the race expressed little surprise at the stewards' decision. =1974: Five-year-old season= Lassalle remained in training as five-year-old, and showed good form despite failing to win in four races. He looked less than fully fit on his seasonal debut in April and finished fourth behind the four-year-old Recupere, Parnell, and Filandre in the Prix Barbeville. In his attempt to repeat his 1973 success in the Prix du Cadran on 26 May, he started second favourite behind Recupere in a field which also included Parnell, Filandre, and Proverb (Goodwood Cup, Doncaster Cup). Ridden by Piggott, he took the lead 400 m from the finish and looked certain to win, but was overtaken in the final strides and beaten by a head by Recupere. The 1974 Ascot Gold Cup was run on much firmer ground than the previous year's edition, and the very slow pace did not suit Lassalle. He nevertheless looked to have a very good chance when taking a clear lead in the straight, but was soon joined by the British-trained Ragstone. In a close contest over the final furlong, he finished third behind Ragstone and the late-running Proverb. In the Prix Kergorlay at Deauville Racecourse in August, he appeared to be outpaced in the straight and finished fifth behind Ribecourt. Assessment and awards No International Classification of European two-year-olds was held in 1971; the official handicappers of Britain, Ireland and France compiled separate rankings for horses which competed in those countries. In the official French Handicap, Lassalle was rated 12 lb inferior to the best juvenile of the season. In the following year, the independent Timeform organisation gave him a rating of 120, making him 14 lb inferior to their top-rated three-year-olds Deep Diver and Sallust. In the following year, Timeform gave him a rating of 125, 5 lb behind Parnell, who was named the best stayer of the season. Lassalle was again rated 125 by Timeform in 1974, 2 lb below Recupere and 3 lb below Ragstone, who was their best stayer. In their annual Racehorses of 1974, they described him as a \\"good-class, genuine and consistent stayer\\", but \\"lacking in finishing pace\\". In their book A Century of Champions, based on a modified version of the Timeform system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Lassalle as an \\"inferior\\" winner of the Gold Cup. Stud record At the end of his racing career, Lassalle was exported to stand at his owner's stud in Japan. He appears to have had problems with low fertility, with only 81 registered foals from 204 coverings in six seasons at stud. He sired the winners of 132 races, but none of these was at Graded level. In 1981, his last season at stud, Lassalle covered only two mares, neither of which produced a foal.

The loss of life made this disaster, in terms of loss of life from the sinking of a single vessel, the fifth-worst tragedy in the history of the Great Lakes. Construction and Career Atlantic was built in 1848 or 1849 in Newport, Michigan, now called Marine City, by J. L. Wolverton. Atlantic was relatively large for the time, long with a tonnage of 1,155 tons, a beam of , and a depth of . She had 85 staterooms and a capacity of over 300 passengers. Atlantic was owned by E. B. Ward of Detroit, or E. B. and S. Ward of St. Clair, Michigan and operated by the Michigan Central Railroad. She was put into service making trips between Buffalo, New York and Detroit, Michigan; she set a speed record of 16 and a half hours for a trip between the two cities. Final voyage On the afternoon of 19 August 1852, Atlantic left Buffalo, heading for Detroit, under the command of Captain J. Byron Pettey. Every cabin was full, and over 250 passengers were on the deck, many Norwegian, Irish, or other European immigrants. Atlantic stopped at Erie, Pennsylvania to pick up even more Norwegian immigrants waiting for ships to take them west to Detroit. Around half of the immigrants waiting were taken aboard; roughly seventy had to be left behind due to lack of space. Atlantic was now dangerously overcrowded, with 500-600 people aboard; the ship's clerk did not keep an exact count. Baggage was piled on the deck, and passengers stayed wherever they could, including on the uppermost hurricane deck and the roof of Atlantic cabin. At 11 pm on 19 August 1852, Atlantic left Erie. The lake was calm; the sources are unclear about the level of visibility, with reports indicating everything from a light mist to a heavy fog. Meanwhile, the new propeller steamer Ogdensburg was heading the other way, from Cleveland, Ohio, to Ogdensburg, New York, carrying a load of wheat. At 2 am on 20 August 1852, the paths of the two ships crossed near Long Point. On board Ogdensburg, the first mate, Degrass McNeil, was on duty. He spotted lights from Atlantic but was sure that Ogdensburg would pass at least a half mile ahead of the other ship. But then Atlantic changed course, turning north as though trying to pass in front of Ogdensburg. McNeil ordered Ogdensburg engines reversed and the ship turned to port, and since Ogdensburg steam whistle was broken, McNeil ran out onto the ship's deck and yelled to try and get the other ship to turn to starboard. Gleason's Pictorial McNeil's actions came too late. Ogdensburg rammed Atlantic on the port side, forward of the paddlewheel, cutting into Atlantic side down to the waterline. Ogdensburg reversed and backed away from Atlantic, while Atlantic continued away under full steam. Perhaps reassured by Atlantic steaming away, McNeil steered Ogdensburg back onto its regular course. Many passengers on Atlantic were awakened by the collision, but the crew of Atlantic made no effort to alert all the passengers. Water flowing in through the hole in Atlantic soon flooded the boilers, bringing the ship to a halt. The passengers and crew began to panic, many throwing anything that would float over the side of the ship before jumping over the side themselves, where many drowned. An attempt was made to launch Atlantic three boats; one capsized, and Captain Petty suffered a concussion while lowering another, leaving him unable to provide any more assistance. The two other boats were lowered, carrying mostly crew members. The bow of Atlantic began to sink, but the stern was kept above water by air trapped inside the ship. Meanwhile, the crew of Ogdensburg realized that Atlantic was in trouble, either because Ogdensburg Captain Richardson reached that conclusion after examining the damage to his ship, or because the crew of Ogdensburg, after stopping their ship to check for damage, heard screams coming from the sinking Atlantic. Ogdensburg turned around and found the half-sunk Atlantic ten minutes later; her crew took survivors off Atlantic stern and rescued others from the water. Shortly after Ogdensburg took the last survivors off of the deck of Atlantic, Atlantic sank completely. The ship did not carry detailed passenger lists, but estimates range from at least 130 lives lost up to 300 lives lost, with an estimated death toll of 250 being common. Aftermath Ogdensburg steamed to the nearest port, which was Erie, Pennsylvania. While there, a group of passengers met and issued a resolution. In it, they condemned the incompetence of the officers of Atlantic with the exception of the clerk, Mr. Givon. They also spoke out against the poor quality of the life preservers on Atlantic and commended the captain of Ogdensburg for returning to the scene. Among the survivors of the disaster was Henry T. Titus, future founder of Titusville, Florida. The wreck Atlantic rests mostly intact under of water near Long Point. That fall, diver John Green was hired by American Express to dive the wreck and retrieve Atlantic safe and money known to be in a cabin, but his attempts failed. In 1855, Green returned with the schooner Yorktown, located the safe, and moved it out to the deck of Atlantic. But Green contracted a near-fatal case of the bends and was taken to a hospital; he was in recovery until the summer of 1856. When he returned to the wreck on 1 July 1856, he found the safe and money were gone. Another diver, Eliot Harrington, had found them both and hauled them to the surface. $36,700 was taken from Atlantic safe, at a time when a decent wage was a dollar a day. American Express went to court for the money; the ending settlement gave Harrington and the four others who worked with him a bit under $2,000 each, with American Express taking the rest. The legal battle over the cause of the wreck went to the United States Supreme Court, who ruled that both ships were at fault. In 1867, the Western Wrecking Company was formed to try and raise Atlantic, but this plan was abandoned two years later. The wreck was rediscovered in 1984 by Port Dover, Ontario diver Michael Lynn Fletcher; the aquatic plants formerly covering the wreck were largely eaten away by zebra mussels. In 1991, a California-based diving company, Mar-Dive, announced that they had found Atlantic, and paid the state of Ohio $14,000 to reform the Western Wrecking Company. But since Atlantic rests inside Canadian waters, the government of Ontario moved to prevent the removal of artifacts from Atlantic, taking the issue to Ontario divisional court. The judge ruled that Atlantic belonged to Ontario. To protect the wreck, an electronic monitoring system was installed that will alert the Ontario Provincial Police if a vessel stays for too long above the wreck.

On 3 December 2016, Freiburg police arrested Hussein Khavari, who had been identified by a hair found at the crime scene, and a CCTV recording from inside a tram. DNA evidence linked him to the crime scene and he was ultimately convicted. Khavari had entered Germany as a refugee in November 2015. It was later discovered that he had served a prison term for attempting to rob and murder a girl in Greece before entering Germany. This prompted a discussion about possible failures in European systems of information exchange about refugees and migrants, and any criminal records they may have. Crime Maria Ladenburger was a 19-year-old medical student at the University of Freiburg. On the night of 15-16 October 2016, Ladenburger attended a party hosted by the university medical faculty. She left the party at 2:37 a.m. and was returning home by bicycle. She was raped by Khavari on her way near the Schwarzwald- Stadion and died of drowning in the river Dreisam shortly after 3:00 a.m. Khavari later claimed to have choked her with a scarf. A jogger found her body later that morning. Investigation Freiburg police formed a special commission consisting of 68 officers, questioned more than 1,400 people, and checked more than 1,600 clues. Khavari was identified by a long strand of hair from a bleached undercut found in the bushes close to the crime scene. A black scarf was also found on the river bed, close to the scene, with traces of Khavari's DNA on it. Based on these findings, he was identified on a CCTV recording taped inside a tram in the vicinity on 17 October. Based on a still from this recording, he was later discovered by a street patrol and arrested. Police announced the arrest during a press conference on 3 December. The chief of Freiburg's criminal investigation said: \\"It would be a relief for the parents of the dead\\" if Khavari would talk about the case. As of the end of December 2016, the accused had refused to speak. On 5 January 2017, the police requested the public's help in identifying a potentially critical witness.

Psychiatrist Hartmut Pleines said in his report to the court that Khavari was neither schizophrenic nor showed any evidence of brain damage or retarded development, but had a low threshold to violence and a tendency towards manipulative influence, and that his bad character traits were the cause of his criminal behavior, \\"not a drug-addiction, nor his place of origin or being a Shia Muslim\\".R√ºdiger Soldt: Das L√ºgen des Hussein K., Faz.net, 21 March 2018 Greek policemen, who had been involved in investigating the earlier crime of Khavari in Corfu, testified at the court in Freiburg that the suspect was \\"indifferent\\" during the interrogation and once had stated, \\"that's just a woman.\\"Christine Kensche: ‚ÄûDas ist doch nur eine Frau‚Äú, sagte Hussein K., Welt online, 26 January 2018 On 22 March 2018, the Landgericht Freiburg convicted Hussein Khavari of aggravated rape and murder and noted a particular severity of guilt.

Politicians also demanded improved forensic equipment for the Freiburg police for some time. Guido Wolf, Minister of Justice of Baden-W√ºrttemberg, called for a change in the code of criminal procedure to allow the police to determine the colour of hair, eyes and skin from a DNA sample. Wolf's desire to change the law triggered a critical response by a group of scholars in an Offener Brief. The scholars argued that the use of forensic DNA phenotyping technology, although not being really precise enough, may have adverse consequences for the individual, the society and the state of law, and that the ethical, legal and social implications should be discussed before using it. They have also formulated a statement on the three current legislative initiatives to expand the use of DNA analyses in criminal investigations. The mayor of Freiburg, Dieter Salomon (Green Party), stated that the origin of the perpetrator should not be used for sweeping judgments. Sigmar Gabriel (SPD chairman) expressed his condolences, and also warned of incitement to hatred and said that \\"refugees can commit the same horrifying crimes as people born in Germany\\". CDU vice-chairwoman, Julia Kl√∂ckner, stated that \\"such cruelties are committed by natives and foreigners, this is no new phenomenon. It's not understandable how a human being can be able to do this.\\" Rainer Wendt, head of the Deutsche Polizeigewerkschaft (German Police Union) said, \\"this and many more victims would not be, if our country would have been prepared for the dangers that are connected to mass immigration.\\" Wendt subsequently faced criticism from Oliver Malchow, the chief of the competitor union, Gewerkschaft der Polizei. In addition, AfD chief J√∂rg Meuthen said, \\"We are shocked about this crime, and realize at the same time, that our warnings of the uncontrolled immigration of hundreds of thousands of young men from patriarchal Islamic cultures were depreciated as populism.\\" ARD news magazine, Tagesschau, did not report the case in its main edition on 3 December, claiming it was of only \\"regional significance\\" and that \\"the special protection for juveniles\\" would apply in this case. Public broadcaster ZDF had carried the story. The reasons for not reporting it were subjected to criticism. Stern magazine wrote that they had given an \\"absurd\\" explanation for their \\"ignorance\\". Two days later, ARD magazine Tagesthemen started to report about the case after public pressure. When chancellor Angela Merkel was questioned about the case during the programme, she stated: \\"If the fact should prove true that an Afghan refugee is responsible, then we should absolutely condemn this, exactly as in the case of any other murderer, and we should clearly name this.\\" ARD announced their intent to engage a \\"quality manager\\" henceforth to deal with the growing public criticism of their decisions. On 15 December 2016, the German Minister for the Interior, Thomas de Maizi√®re blamed Greece for not releasing an international arrest warrant in the case. Die Zeit reported in 2016 that Greece had announced \\"that the fingerprints and personal details of the man had been stored in the European Eurodac system since his arrival in Greece in 2013.\\" The report was confirmed by Welt. Furthermore, Deutsche Welle reported that \\"this data was available to all European security authorities.\\" Several German politicians, among them Boris Palmer (The Greens) and Thomas Strobl (CDU), Minister of the Interior of Baden-W√ºrttemberg, demanded better checks on the age of unaccompanied minors in reaction to reports that the perpetrator was probably not underage.De Maizi√®re greift griechische Beh√∂rden an, n-tv.de, 15 December 2016, in German Strobl demanded an examination of the bone age (x-ray of the wrist) to clarify the age of alleged minors.

They have previously played in the Cork Athletic Union League. The club also fields teams in various junior and youth leagues. Their schoolboy section regularly fields up to ten teams in the Cork Schoolboy's League. History =Early years= Rockmount A.F.C. was formed in 1924 in the Commons Road area of Cork city.

Other members of this league included Cork Bohemians, Fordsons, Cobh Ramblers and Mallow United plus two clubs who shared their name with future League of Ireland clubs, Cork Celtic and Cork City. League success initially eluded Rockmount but they did win the Munster Junior Cup in both 1929‚Äì30 and 1932‚Äì33. In 1935 club activities were suspended. However Rockmount A.F.C. was revived in 1951‚Äì52, initially as a schoolboy team. In 1955‚Äì56, a junior team was also entered in the Cork Athletic Union League. Rockmount finished as runners up in the Cork AUL in 1959‚Äì60, 1965‚Äì66 and 1967‚Äì68 before they won the title in 1975‚Äì76.

He was the youngest of the four P√¢ris brothers, who were financiers under Louis XIV and Louis XV. At the height of his fortunes he had 370,000 livres invested in the powerful Soci√©t√© d'Angola, set up to deal in the Atlantic slave trade, managed by Antoine Walsh, the richest and most famous of the Irish of Nantes. He held a number of titles: marquis of Brunoy, count of Sampigny, baron Dagouville, count of Ch√¢teaumeillant, d'Argenton et Veuil d'Argenson, viscount de la Motte Feuilly, baron Saint-Jeanvrin, Saligny et Marigny, seigneur of Villers-sur-Mer, Chateauneuf, La Ch√©tardie, Varenne, Lamotte-Glauville, Bourgeauville, Drubec, des Humi√®res, Le Donjon, La Forest les Dureaux, Lamirande, Lachetardie, and other places. Early life The suffix \\"Monmartel\\" comes from an estate at Moirans, spelled \\"Montmartel\\", acquired by his father, which included the inn the family ran. The inn stood on the route taken by supply trains for the French army in Italy; in 1693 the P√¢ris boys acted as guides for the army suppliers, in whose Paris offices they eventually went to work. Jean spent his early years at Moirans in the family business, and was a soldier for a time before joining his older brothers Antoine and Claude in Paris. There he benefited from the valuable network of contacts they had built up, which enabled him in his turn to begin ascending the ladder of society: as early as 1704 he had been made Intendant General of the Army of Flanders. The grain trade was particularly profitable at this time, when transport was primitive, and where the slightest shortage sent prices soaring, benefitting whoever had the means of managing large volumes of stock. He was made War Commissar in 1709, under Louis XIV, and he bought the post of Treasurer of the Ponts et Chauss√©es in 1715. He was involved in the op√©ration du visa in 1716 - the systematic management of payments to government bondholders, his first venture into the world of finance. Exiled in 1720 along with his brothers, he remained away from Paris until the end of December. The large amounts of money he had made, along with his brothers, trading in military supplies and in wholesale commerce, allowed him to purchase the lordship of Brunoy, with its ch√¢teau, in 1722. Shortly before this, in 1721, one of his friends, Fran√ßois Poisson, asked him to act as godfather for his newborn daughter. He chose her names, Jeanne-Antoinette, and she was later to become Madame de Pompadour. Lord of Brunoy Considered to be the richest man in the kingdom after Louis XV, he was responsible for the masterpiece of 18th century landscape architecture - the \\"Great Waters of Brunoy\\" ‚Äì which he wished to be as grandiose as those of Versailles - issuing from the forest of Yerres thanks to a system of pumps, and flowing down the slopes of the plateau of the Forest of S√©nart. The park consisted of a series of basins, with great banks of flowers, statues, a long canal and a waterfall, powered by a machine created by . The result was widely praised, and Brunoy became the favourite place for Madame de Pompadour, Voltaire, and Foreign Minister Choiseul to visit. Fall and return The bankruptcy of John Law meant that the Paris brothers were recalled from exile, and the Regent Orleans entrusted them with the operation du visa, aiming to restore confidence in France's shattered finances. Their position was strengthened in 1723 after the death of the Regent. In 1724 Jean Paris de Monmartel acquired the post of Guard of the Royal Treasury. This capture of the finances of the realm, and a self-enrichment considered by some to be much too rapid, reinforced the rancour of many of France's nobles towards them, as well as of many commoners. In a palace revolution on 11 June 1726, they were ejected from power and exiled once again. Paris de Monmartel spent some time at Saumur, before moving on to Sampigny and eventually returning to Brunoy. The disastrous state of the country‚Äôs finances impelled the new First Minister, Cardinal Fleury, to recall Jean Paris to Versailles in 1730. Jean and his brother Joseph also took advantage of another favourable circumstance to move closer to the centre of power ‚Äì the death of Fleury and the arrival at court of Madame de Pompadour. Court banker and powerbroker Jeanne Antoinette Poisson, Marquise de Pompadour was the goddaughter of Jean Paris de Monmartel. Her father had worked as a clerk to the Paris brothers, and this special relationship allowed him to gradually take control over the key areas of the country's policy. The Ministries of Finance, War and Foreign Affairs were indirectly controlled by Paris de Monmartel and his brother Paris Duverney. Saint Simon wrote in his M√©moires: \\"They (the Paris brothers) have once again become the masters of finance and the whole Court is at their feet.\\" As banker to the Court from 1740 and then State Counsellor from 1755, his influence was significant. The Mar√©chal de Saxe wrote of Monmartel and his brother Duverney: \\"These are two people who do not wish to appear and who, fundamentally, are very strong in this country because they keep the entire machine running. They are always my intimate friends, and they are the most honest of people and the most upstanding citizens.\\" The Foreign Minister Abb√© de Bernis wrote in 1758: \\"We are dependent on Monmartel‚Ä¶. If you ignore this man, bankruptcy follows.\\" Paris de Monmartel remained the Court banker until 1759, when he handed the role over to Jean-Joseph de Laborde. Family Paris Marmontel married three times: first, in 1720, to Marguerite Fran√ßoise M√©gret (1704-1720), daughter of Fran√ßois-Nicolas M√©gret d‚Äô√âtigny, who had also made his fortune in the wheat trade; then in 1724 to his niece Antoinette Justine Paris (d.1739). His third marriage (1746) was to Marie Armande de B√©thune (1709 ‚Äì 1772), sister of the Marquis of B√©thune. His son Armand-Louis Joseph Paris de Monmartel (1748-81), State Counsellor, Grand Master of the Hotel of the King, Marquis de Brunoy, ceded his chateau to the Comte de Provence after running up debts. In 1767 Armand-Louis married Jeanne de P√©russe d'Escars (1745-1823) from whom he quickly separated, without issue.

The group's name takes after their hometown in Yangjiang, Guangdong Province. The Yangjiang Group's works have been exhibited in Europe and Asia. Their works have been commented to show a strong attachment to a sense of place in their hometown.  History  The collective method of work follows other Chinese art groups such as the Big Tail Elephants. The Yangjiang Group's works are noted for their apolitical content, non-representational method of expression, and unabashed refutation and criticism of political analysis of Chinese contemporary art. Xiao Fengxia attributed the aniconism of their works to a degree of political autonomy from Beijing in Guangdong Province: \\"Far away from the hierarchal chronotope of Beijing, southern China drifts away from the center‚Ä¶the local people's innovative spirit, lifestyles, and political feelings are unique, and do not completely follow Beijing‚Ä¶Southern China's economic boom. especially in Hong Kong, Shenzhen, and Guangzhou in the Pearl River Delta Region...led to unprecedented growth in prosperity that overturned orthodox Socialist thought.\\" The Yangjiang Group work primarily with calligraphy, but also other mediums such as video and wax sculpture. The group frequently combines various mediums that engages many different senses, and with special attention to the relationship among the work of art, the audience, and the gallery space. Their works are often done impromptu to erase the distance between a work of art and the lived experience, where \\"life itself becomes an integral part of their art.\\" The Yangjiang Group draws from classical Chinese practice of experiencing works of art where audience participation is essential, as noted by Lisa Catt. The group also addresses the issue of commoditization of art that enables a work of art to take on a new meaning, and lose its ability to dictate culture as a result. The group continue to work in their hometown in Yangjiang, where they promote the local art scenes in southern China to counterbalance the financial potential of contemporary art from Beijing and Shanghai.  Works  = Wax Series =  Waterfall (2002), Pond (2003) and Garden of Pine ‚Äì Also Fiercer than Tiger II (2010)  Made almost entirely from wax, Zheng Guogu explained that the dripping movement of wax shows the infinite dimension of physical objects. In addition, the work calls into question the comparative meaning of wax in Chinese and Western culture. The work combines calligraphy written by ordinary people to show the kinetic nature of the art of calligraphy. = Debuted in Yangjiang Group: Actions for Tomorrow = Yangjiang Group: Actions for Tomorrow was a show in 4A Centre for Contemporary Asian Art in Chinatown, Sydney over the period of the 2015 Chinese New Year.

It shut down at the end of 2016.  History  The first version of Bored@ was created for Columbia students and was called \\"bored@butler\\". The name was taken from Columbia's Butler Library, and only people with an e-mail address with the columbia.edu domain name could sign up. While technically available to faculty, bored@ was almost exclusively used by students. The board remained completely anonymous. Users could post anything they wanted and could interact with other posts with \\"agree,\\" \\"disagree,\\" and \\"newsworthy\\" voting options, or by replying to the posts themselves. By 2007, Bored@ had individual communities at most of the Ivy League schools, all named after their respective libraries.b@devblog Bored@ went completely offline for much of 2009 until being relaunched in October of that year to great success. Users were able to create \\"personalities\\" to tie to their posts. These handles were intended to remain anonymous while allowing users to keep track of each other's posts. Anonymous posting was still allowed and common. Moderators assigned by Pappas could also vote to remove posts deemed in violation of the site's rules. Eventually, Pappas allowed any school to create their own board. Any student who created an account on boredat.com with a new email address could create a board for their school. These communities were named after the schools themselves rather than their libraries. Carleton College is the only school to have a consistently growing board that was not directly created by Pappas. Carleton's board was created in 2013, and Pappas saw potential in it. Carleton's student population is roughly 2,000, and Pappas thought small communities allowed for healthier boards.Huffington Post: \\"Why The Founder Of The Notorious Bored@Baker Finally Shut The Site Down\\"About Carleton Carleton's users began to host parties for users of the website, and a small subculture began to develop. Different schools' users could interact with one another on the \\"Global Board.\\" By 2014, the three most active boards belonged to Dartmouth College, Columbia, and Carleton. Grinnell College and Harvard University also had small active communities.  Controversy  Dartmouth's community, Bored at Baker, saw an influx of hostile posts, including rape and death threats towards certain students in April 2013.The Dartmouth: \\"Bored at Baker shut down by founder In 2014, a \\"guide\\" on how to rape a specific member of the Dartmouth class of 2017 was posted, the target of which stating later that she had been raped as a result. Threats were also made towards a Dartmouth alumna. Students speculated that the website allowed for brazen comments that students would not make were they not anonymous. = Decline = In 2014, Pappas acknowledged that bored@ was not self-sustaining and introduced ads to the website. An option to directly donate to server costs was also available. These saw use for a short time, but in 2015, ads were removed from the website. Dartmouth's board was shut down with little warning in October 2015, but the Global Board remained available to them. Pappas began to see Bored@ as a side project and said the Dartmouth board was too time- consuming.The Dartmouth: \\"Bored at Baker returns to campus\\" Users began to think the website was too loosely moderated and controversial to remain popular, particularly with the rising popularity of Yik Yak as a similar social media outlet. On December 1, 2016, Pappas announced that bored@ would be shutting down indefinitely at the end of the year due to expenses becoming too much for him to handle on his own. Despite receiving a number of donations via Patreon, the site shut down on December 31.  Website  = Mechanics = Bored@ featured personalities and a point system. Users had a point total associated with their personality, and a separate total associated with their account. Personalities with the most points were ranked on the \\"Zeitgeist,\\" and the personality with the single highest total gained the title of \\"Network Leader.\\" This title can be held by any personality. Users received 5 points for getting an agree, disagree, or newsworthy vote, 5 points when somebody visited their profile, 2 points when they received direct messages, 1 point for other users clicking on a link they shared, and 15 points for receiving a reply to a post. Users could receive badges for achieving certain milestones as well. Making a certain number of posts, receiving large numbers of agrees or disagrees, having high point totals, or logging in on certain holidays all warranted badges. Users could choose to post identifying information with their personalities or to keep them completely secret. Moderators generally removed specific mentions of names or well-known events. If a user so chose, they could also go into \\"rehab,\\" which locked them out of their account for a set amount of time. 2 hour and 24 hour rehab programs were the only options until early 2016, when options for 5 day, 15 day, 30 day, 3 month, and 1 year rehabs were added. Going into rehab also awarded the user points. Posts receiving a high number of agrees or disagrees mae it onto the \\"Week's Best\\" and \\"Week's Worst\\" sections on the website. \\"Today's Top Headlines\\" contained posts receiving the most newsworthy votes every 24 hours. Users could check into different locations on campus to designate that they were posting from that location. The check-in options included real places (academic and residential buildings) and fake places (such as \\"the void\\") and were unique to each school's board. Personalities became the \\"mayor\\" of a location once they made more posts than anybody else from that place. = Rules = Pappas aimed to preserve anonymity, but acknowledged the issues that came with it. Abusive or identifying posts towards other users were prohibited, and users were encouraged to report such posts so moderators could remove them. Pappas reserved the power to restore wrongfully removed posts if need be. Posts threatening acts of violence were also prohibited. Sexually explicit links were allowed as long as they came with a warning.

It has been featured in The Washington Post about Russian propaganda and the spread of fake news. PropOrNot's methods and anonymity have received criticism. Operations and organization The website is written anonymously, and purports to be the arbiter of which opinions are not acceptable and which are acceptable, by either labelling or not labelling certain expressed opinions as \\"propaganda\\"; a spokesperson for the website who spoke by phone to The New Yorker was described as an American male who was \\"well versed in Internet culture and swore enthusiastically.\\" The same spokesperson said that the group comprised around 40 unnamed individuals. Writing in Rolling Stone, Matt Taibbi opined that based on \\"its Twitter responses to criticism of its report, PropOrNot sounded not like a group of sophisticated military analysts, but like one teenager\\". =Compiled list= On November 30 2016, PropOrNot published a list of some 200 websites they classify as Russian propaganda based on \\"a combination of manual and automated analysis, including analysis of content, timing, technical indicators, and other reporting\\". The group's list includes Zero Hedge, Naked Capitalism, the Ron Paul Institute, Black Agenda Report, Truthout, Truthdig, antiwar.com, and many others, which the group suggests are \\"consistently, uncritically, and one-sidedly echoing, repeating, being used by, and redirecting their audiences to Russian official and semi-official state media\\". CounterPunch in response called PropOrNot a \\"shady little group,\\" its findings \\"bogus,\\" and their inclusion on the list a \\"baseless allegation.\\" After email communications, PropOrNot agreed to remove CounterPunch from the list. PropOrNot has said there was a Russian propaganda effort involved in propagating fake news during the 2016 presidential election. PropOrNot has said it analyzed data from Twitter and Facebook and tracked propaganda from a disinformation campaign by Russia that had a national reach of 15 million people within the United States. PropOrNot concluded that accounts belonging to both Russia Today and Sputnik News promoted \\"false and misleading stories in their reports,\\" and additionally magnified other false articles found on the Internet to support their propaganda effort. Criticism PropOrNot's methods and anonymity have received criticism from publications such as The New Yorker, The Intercept, and Rolling Stone, as well as Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting. Andrew Cockburn, Washington editor for Harper's, was sharply critical of The Washington Posts decision to put the story on its front page, calling the article a \\"sorry piece of trash.\\" Writers in The Intercept, Fortune, and Rolling Stone challenged The Washington Post for including a report by an organization with no reputation for fact-checking (such as PropOrNot itself) in an article on \\"fake news.\\" The Intercept journalists Glenn Greenwald and Ben Norton were particularly critical of the inclusion of Naked Capitalism on the list of \\"useful idiots\\" for Russian propagandists. Writing in the The New Yorker, Adrian Chen said that he had been previously contacted by the organization, but had chosen not to follow up with them. Looking more carefully into their methodology, he argued that PropOrNot's criteria for establishing propaganda - which included critical commentary of the United States, the European Union and NATO - were so broad that they could have included \\"not only Russian state-controlled media organizations, such as Russia Today, but nearly every news outlet in the world, including the Post itself\\" on their list. Eliot Higgins, of the Bellingcat website, referred to the methodology report as \\" pretty amateur\\" and told Chen: \\"I think it should have never been an article on any news site of any note.\\" Writing for Rolling Stone magazine, Matt Taibbi questioned the methodology used by PropOrNot and the lack of information about who was behind the organization. In December 2016, after receiving criticism, The Washington Post appended an \\"Editor's Note\\" to its article in response to the criticism of PropOrNot's list of websites. The note read, \\"The Post, which did not name any of the sites, does not itself vouch for the validity of PropOrNot's findings regarding any individual media outlet, nor did the article purport to do so.\\"  See also  * 2016 United States election interference by Russia * Hamilton 68 References External links * American political websites 2016 establishments in the United States Organizations based in the United States Organizations established in 2016 Propaganda in Russia ","title":"PropOrNot"},{"id":"52464512","text":"The Ford Mustang II is a small, front-engined (V8), open \\"two-plus-two\\" concept car built by the Ford Motor Company in 1963.

Ford executives also worried that the mid-engined sports car \\"... was too complex for regular production.\\" =Ford Mustang= Ford's marketing studies revealed that if a unique-looking \\"sporty car\\" could be offered at an affordable price, it would find many buyers. Iacocca had already introduced sporty versions of the Ford Falcon compact car with limited success, The Fairlane Group began to work on a front-engine, four-seater design, one of approximately 13 designs, variously known as the T-5 in company parlance, and later, the Mustang. To speed development, Ford Falcon and Fairlane components were used. Nearly the only design element that remained from the original Mustang I were the fake louvers that recreated the radiator scoops of the two-seater, and its name, emblazoned on its side panels as the \\"galloping Mustang\\" logo.Davis 2014, p. 40. The J. Walter Thompson Advertising agency created a marketing campaign that incorporated \\"sneak views\\" and specialized audience surveys that revealed the future Mustang to the general public.Leffingwell 2003, pp. 66‚Äì67. The initial publicity created a groundswell of enquiries that filtered all the way back to Ford headquarters. =Ford Mustang II= Iacocca knew that the public interest in the Mustang was strong, but he wanted to pique further enthusiasm by creating a concept car that would hint at future Ford products. The result was the Mustang II, redesigned by stylist John Najjar using elements of the Mustang I. The car, initially still known as the \\"Cougar\\" was based on a pre- production prototype, and fabricated by the Dearborn Steel Tubing (DST) company.Leffingwell 1995, p. 33. The prototype bore the designation: \\"X 8902-SB-208\\". Visually, the Mustang II resembled the first generation Mustang, with the same triple-bar taillights, faux side louvers and the 108-inch wheelbase, but some modifications made it a unique variant. The steel body, reinforced by fibreglass sections was five inches longer and three inches shorter in height. The body did not incorporate bumpers and featured a cut- back, swept low-profile windscreen and buried, sculpted headlight treatment. Starting with the original car's roof cut off to create a convertible, a detachable fibreglass hardtop was made, but the Mustang II often appeared as a roadster.Fria 2010, pp. 106‚Äì107.

The other special abilities that Knack can use are unlocked through the use of upgrading Knack with Knack parts, Relics, and Crystal Parts.  Synopsis  =Setting= Two centuries prior to the events of Knack II, known as the time of The Crystal Wars, the advanced civilization of the Goblins, known then as the High-Goblins, feuded with humans and sought after energy-potent crystals, which were found only on human territory. Yurick, a High Goblin leader and master engineer, created the Ancient Weapons, an army of powerful robots, to eradicate the humans. The High Goblin empire expanded as they continued their onslaught, until the human leader and warrior Marius and his troops began to defeat the Ancient Weapons in a single with the use of rock, vines, traps, and cunning, propelling their continuous victories over the course of the war. Once defeated, Yurick returned to his laboratory to create a control center to command his robot forces as well as more powerful weapons, most notably the Titans, for their final battle against Marius and the humans. While Marius and Yurick fought with their armies, Marius had sent a strike team while they were preoccupied, disabling the Ancient Weapon's control center and defeating the High Goblins. Marius and his men's lament destroying the High-Goblins, becoming the very thing they wished to stop. He then found the order of the monks and led people to a new era of peace and wisdom. =Plot= After an unspecified number of years since the events of Knack, Newhaven is under attack by four Titans. Lucas indicates that this was his undoing and Knack fights to help correct their unknown wrong-doings. Six months earlier, Lucas is flying with his uncle Ryder and Knack to an island, through a Goblin infested forest, and uncover a monument dedicated to Marius during the Crystal Wars. As they continue, they find a battlefield from the Crystal War, desecrated with the bodies of the vanguards of the Goblin Army. As they linger around, the army rises from the dead and attack the group. Knack protects them and they escape back the plane, making their way back to Doctor Vargas and Charlotte at a monastery in Norcliff to recount their experience. They all gather at the monastery and meet with two monks, Xander, their overseer, and Ava, their youth leader, and decide to seek a mountain pass in the morning to uncover Ancient Weapons in the area. Morning arrives when the group part ways at the mountain pass and find a burned downed ruins of a village, unable to uncover the mystery. The group then returns to Doctor Vargas, Charlotte, and Xander while they attempt to reach a conclusion, Lucas and Ava decide to ask Uncle Ryder to help them reach Targun, the High Goblin City, where Yurick originally created these robots. They arrive at Targun Ruins and traverse within the walls of the city to find Yurick's laboratory. Once broken in, they discover part of a map to the High Goblin empire, a remote for controlling the robots, and decide to travel to a museum in Atheneum to better understand Targun's control center for their Ancient Weapons. The group reach Antheum's museum, finding that the city has been invaded by robots and Goblins. Knack brings an artifact to the group, taken from a commander. They suspect that the control center may be on a map that Uncle Ryder acquired and manage to pinpoint where it may be. Xander and Doctor Vargas urge Lucas about the importance of the artifact and debate about what should be done with it. The group reaches the area on the map and uncover the control center's whereabouts, finding a High-Goblin city. Knack then faces the commander, but Gundahar speaks through a communicator to Knack about his anger towards him and to find the control room for their confrontation. They all return to the monastery to discuss their next course of action. Lucas deduces that the control center is across the ocean based on their encounters with the High-Goblins. They manage to find a lone island and encounter the control center, disabling the power supply. They battle their way to Gundahar and he is tossed off a cliff. Xander then makes his way to meet with Lucas and reveals his plan of using the artifact in the control center, using the Ancient Weapons for his own purposes. Lucas and Knack remain marooned on the island for five months and two weeks after losing to Xander, devising a plan to get off the island by recovering robots parts to create an aircraft. They arrive at the Doctor's Mansion and rescue Doctor Vargas, Uncle Ryder, and Charlotte. Doctor Vargas informs Lucas and Knack that Xander has been attacking the city and Ava has been leading these attacks. They invaded to Katrina's Fortress, Uncle Ryder's ex-girlfriend, who owns a security firm and a private army, to recruit her assistance in combating Xander's forces. Knack convinces Katrina to use her robot army to battle Xander's army. Lucas and Knack sneak Beneath Norcliff to begin their infiltration against Xander with Katrina's army outside the gates. Ava then assists Knack in gaining further entrance in Xander's facility when she finds out that Xander has been using the Ancient Weapons. Knack and gang follow Xander to the Nexus, an ancient High-Goblin island. Xander uses the artifact to energize the machine on the island to make the robots and Titans stronger. Lucas and Knack then follow Xander to Newhaven to fight his army. Knack destroys the Titans that Xander commandeered, only for Xander to use the artifact, rendering Knack weak and captured. Three months later, Knack is in Xander's Prison below the monastery, and is rescued by Lucas; who recounts that Ava and Lucas had split up to find Knack and that everyone had slowly started disappearing. Xander has created The Armageddon Machine to revert humanity to a more primitive time through destruction with the use of the artifact. Lucas and Knack enter the Armageddon Machine with the help of Ava and other monks, then she goes to evacuate Newhaven. Lucas upgraded his plane to withstand the Armageddon Machine's ray and to fire back stronger. Knack then takes the artifact and Xander before the Machine collapses. Xander then activates the artifact to create a massive Knack-like monster before he perishes. They fight and Knack destroys the artifact, restoring peace. The chairwomen of Newhaven signs a treaty with the monks and throw a celebration in everyone's victory. Ava and Lucas reconcile, Uncle Ryder takes Lucas aside to help in rekindling his relationship with Katrina, and Knack and Lucas then leave to venture towards new adventures.

It protects the edge of a plateau on the border with Bolivia in the region of transition from cerrado to Amazon rainforest. The park has been poorly protected and is badly degraded in areas by deforestation and conversion to pasturage. It is threatened by illegal squatters, hunting and burning. Location The Serra Ricardo Franco State Park is the municipality of Vila Bela da Sant√≠ssima Trindade, Mato Grosso. It has an area of . It borders the Noel Kempff Mercado National Park in Bolivia, to the west. The Serra de Ricardo Franco is a plateau connected to the Serra de Santa B√°rbara and Serra de S√£o Vicente, which form the most visible relief feature of the Brazilian midwest. The park contains several left bank tributaries of the upper Guapor√© River. The park holds the Jatob√° waterfall, the highest in the state with a vertical drop of . History The Serra Ricardo Franco State Park was created by decree 1.796 of 4 November 1997, covering lands in the municipality of Vila Bela da Sant√≠ssima Trindade with an area of . The objective was to protect water resources and the viability of movement of native fauna, preserve samples of existing ecosystems and allow controlled use by the public. There were already squatters in the park when it was created. An effort was made to reduce the size of the park in 2003 to exclude land used for productive activities. That year the state government allowed the deadline for expropriations to expire. In November 2004 the State Environment Foundation (FEMA) presented a proposal approved by the state governor Blairo Maggi to reduce the size of the park by . The reason was that the government no longer had money for expropriations. The areas would be those that had been occupied before the park was created, reaching to the foot of the mountains. In compensation, FEMA proposed to define an environmental protection area of in part of the area removed from the park. The mayor of the municipality said the proposal was very interesting. He was in favor of the park as long as it was not in the productive areas. He was not concerned about loss of ecological funding, which was small in comparison to the revenue from the new areas that could be planted with soybeans. On 17 October 2014 landowners and squatters were called upon to submit documents relevant to properties in the park pending land ownership regularization. The consultative council was created by ordinance 585 of 5 December 2014. On 10 December 2015 land in the park was donated to the State of Mato Grosso in compensation for the environmental impact of the 230 kv Jauru-Porto Velho transmission line. SEMA identified 35 legally owned properties in the park by March 2016. The owners could sell the land directly to the state, or to other landowners in Mato Grosso who needed legal conservation areas to compensate for degraded areas. A management plan is required before the park can be officially open to the public, and in March 2016 SEMA had plans to hire a company to prepare the plan. As of 2016 the park was supported by the Amazon Region Protected Areas Program. Environment Jatob√° waterfall The park is in the Guapor√© Depression. It is in the ecotone region between the Brazilian cerrado and the Amazon rainforest, with unique landscapes. Although some areas have been degraded by human activities, there are still extensive areas of seasonal semi-deciduous forest, with many Amazonian species. There are large areas of rocky fields at the margin of the park that have not been studied in any detail. The park is home to flora and fauna typical of both biomes, including endemic and endangered animals such as the giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), neotropical otter (Lontra longicaudis) and giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis). The otters are found in small groups or isolated pairs along the Guapor√© River. Other mammals include monkeys, jaguars and tapirs. There are at least 174 species of fish. There are also large numbers of amphibians, reptiles, mammals and birds. Human activities The main conflicting uses are deforestation, burning, predatory hunting and invasion by squatters. A large part of the park has been heavily degraded by logging, mining, deforestation and burning to create pasturage. In November 2015 staff from SEMA and the military police were searching the park for about 40 illegal gold miners who had moved there after being expelled from the Serra da Borda. However, the park has significant ecotourism potential with walks, trails and environmental education. This would stimulate the local economy with demand for accommodations, restaurants, guides and so on. As of 2016 only the Namorados waterfall circuit of trails was open, an area widely used by local residents.

Early life Souper was born in Middlesex, England.1841 England Census He was baptised in 1802 in London and presented to the church in 1803 in Saint Helier, Jersey,Jersey, Church of England Baptisms, Marriages, and Burials, 1540-1812 the son of William Henry Souper and Amelia Ann; his mother was the daughter of Philip Reinagle.ODNB His father was a British Army officer, in the 1st Regiment of Foot. He exchanged in 1797 into a regiment raised to serve in the West Indies. It was led by William Myers, had incorporated the St Vincent Rangers, and was known as \\"Myers' Regiment of Foot\\". He was paymaster of the Chasseurs Britanniques at the time the family was in Jersey. In 1813, Souper's father was transferred to become a paymaster at Lymington, Dorset. In a noted case, he was convicted of a murder in Lymington in 1814, after a duel in which he killed another officer. The judge, Sir Henry Dampier, recommended mercy. It was then reported that Henry William and Amelia Ann Souper had a family of six sons and a daughter. In 1817, Souper became a lieutenant in the York Chasseurs, which he had joined as an ensign in May 1815. This formation took part in the Invasion of Guadeloupe. He was placed on half pay in 1817, and became paymaster of the recruiting district at Harwich, for foreign troops. Trinidad Philip Dottin Souper became Colonial Secretary of Trinidad under Ralph James Woodford, Governor from 1813. Woodford used very young officials for administrative work, and kept them on a short leash. It was noted that an attempt to bribe Souper was rejected. An 1834, report on the drive to reduce sinecures shows Souper taking on the dual roles of Secretary and Clerk of the Council. There were in fact three defined official roles, Secretary, Clerk and Register (or court intendant, often called escribando, a term inherited from the Spanish colonial time in Trinidad). In 1810, James Chapman, who held officially the three posts, had been listed as a sinecure holder using deputies for the functions. Therefore Souper, who held each of these posts at some times, was for most of his career doing so as a deputy. He was absent from his post as Governor's Secretary in 1824 for reasons of bad health. The \\"acting escribando\\" in July of that year was George F. Souper. George Frederick Souper of Trinidad became a barrister of the Inner Temple, being called to the bar in 1833. An anonymous pamphlet by \\"A Free Mulatto\\" of 1824 accused Souper of acting in a bigoted way towards a man of colour who had served in the militia, around 1820. It records alleged slurs (including the denial of the title Mr. on a passport, and on the competence of the previous Secretary Peter Gellineau). The author was Jean-Baptiste Philip, of French- speaking \\"free coloured\\" background and a doctor, and the pamphlet An Address to the Right Hon. Earl Bathurst, published in London, dealt with grievances specific to the \\"coloured population of Trinidad\\", understood free. In particular it dismissed an argument against setting a precedent for the recognition of people of colour, in relation to a \\"Dr. Philip\\" requesting a position from Woodward as military surgeon. He stated that Gellineau was moved to make room for Souper, but held posts including that of escribando. He argued that the precedent had thereby already been set. A related complaint about the Council, in which Souper as Clerk was named, was that of George Pilkington, civil engineer on Trinidad and future abolitionist campaigner, from 1830. In autobiographical work he alleged that the Council had acted wrongly against him on a financial matter, after he had promoted a person of colour to officer rank in the militia cavalry. In 1829, Souper acted as executor for his uncle, Philip Reinagle (the younger), who was on Trinidad. He took part in the 1830 public meeting hosted by Robert Neilson that appointed Joseph Marryat to represent West Indian planter interests. Under the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, Souper received compensation, for one enslaved person in Trinidad. In 1836, he was still acting as Clerk to the Council of Trinidad, but was seeking a post in New South Wales. Company Secretary In July 1836, Souper was corresponding from John Street, The Adelphi in London, as Secretary to the South Western Railway Company. In 1837 the company reportedly reached an informal agreement with the London, Falmouth and Exeter Railway Company, a rival in the south-west of England, not to obstruct parliamentary bills. It followed a deputation from the London, Falmouth and Exeter meeting Souper. In 1839, Souper was serving as Secretary to the Eastern Coast of Central America Commercial and Agricultural Company. He had been brought in from South Western Railway Company, resigning his post there, at the same time as Peter Harriss Abbott who had been on the board of the South Western Railway Company, and Peter Pollock QC who had been the company's counsel, both of whom went onto the board. He was replaced as Company Secretary, however, in 1840, by James A. Winsor. Souper was Secretary to the Irish North Midland Railway in 1845. This was a proposed railway, which went out of business in August 1847, repaying investors 12 shillings in the pound. According to Alumni Cantabrigienses, Souper also worked as a surgeon. The entry has transcription errors \\"Dotter\\" for \\"Dottin\\" and \\"Diana\\" for \\"Oriana\\". Last years In 1848, Souper was appointed Registrar of the Court of First Instance on Mauritius. He was Registrar of the Supreme Court there, from 1852. In 1857 he was appointed collector of internal revenue on Mauritius. This position gave a seat on the Mauritius Council, ex officio, as well as position as vendue master.

As written on their certificate of incorporation, their mission statement was to ‚Äúpromote social intercourse among its members,‚Äù and two, for ‚Äúthe mutual benefit and pleasure and the advancement in the various branches of musical art of its members.‚Äù The thirty founders listed on the document, forming the first board of directors, included cellist Hans Kronold, organist-composers Clarence Eddy, C. B. Hawley, and Frank Edwin Ward, and first presidents Tali Esen Morgan and David Bispham.Our History. 1956. MS, Club Archives. Box 1. Musicians Club of New York. Print. The club's first headquarters were at 62 West 45th Street in Midtown Manhattan. Early club operations included various dinners and performances, held at such venues as the New Amsterdam Theatre, Carnegie Hall, and Delmonico's, while performers included club members and musicians such as Ignacy Jan Paderewski, Frances Alda, Ernestine Schumann-Heink, and Rudolph Ganz. In addition to musical performances, events would also feature comedy performances, folk songs, and lectures, and were known for being attended by the musical elite; one 1916 dinner was attended by soprano Johanna Gadski, violinist Fritz Kreisler, and tenor Enrico Caruso. A goal for some of these events was to provide a platform for contemporary American composers, who were considered underrepresented in the musical world. During its first decade the club hosted individual events dedicated to the works of composers such as Charles Wakefield Cadman, Sidney Homer, Mary Turner Salter, and Amy Beach; other women composers featured by the club during this period included Harriet Ware and Gena Branscombe, who would also continue to perform for the club for several more decades as a composer, conductor, and instrumentalist. From 1913 the club president was New York Symphony Orchestra conductor Walter Damrosch, who helped attract interest in the club. During his presidency the club headquarters were moved to 14 West 12th Street, a building shared with the Civic Club that held a 250-seat auditorium and a roof garden. Damrosch was reported as president as late as 1920, and he retained the title of honorary president until his death in 1950. In 1918 the club held a fundraiser to provide support to French musicians who were struggling during World War I, and the following year launched a campaign for a proposed ‚ÄúAmerican Composers‚Äô Fund‚Äù, through which American composers would be supported by government grants totaling from $200,000 to $1,000,000. While eventually unsuccessful, the initiative received support from figures such as composer Henry F. Gilbert, arts patron Otto Hermann Kahn, and Congressman John J. Eagan, who at one point planned to propose a bill to Congress establishing such a fund, along with a national conservatory. = Frank La Forge and early scholarships = Frank La Forge, president from 1935-1953 Under the presidency of teacher and accompanist Frank La Forge, who began his tenure in 1935, the club endeavored to expand their mission to support young musicians and to foster general interest in classical music. The club fulfilled the first part of this mission by donating to music schools and sponsoring students at programs such as Tanglewood's Berkshire Music Center, and by 1953, the club estimated that it had contributed $1,500 to the cause of supporting young artists. That same year, La Forge suddenly died onstage at the age of 73 while performing piano at a club event in a Beekman Tower ballroom. In 1956, under president Norman Dello Joio, the club first presented what came to be known as the Young Artist Awards, with the first winners being soprano Judith Raskin and baritone Carl White, who were awarded a total of $700. Later known as the Serge and Olga Koussevitzky Young Artist Awards, later recipients have included Jean Kraft (1959), Robert DeGaetano (1969), Paul Neubauer (1982) and Fran√ßois Salque (1994). = Koussevitzky years, KIRA, and 1979 reincorporation = In 1962 the presidency was assumed by Olga Koussevitzky, widow of conductor and composer Serge Koussevitzky and friend to figures such as Aaron Copland and Leonard Bernstein. Having been involved with education programs at Tanglewood Music Center and a figure behind the creation of a composers' studio near the premises, Koussevitzky expanded the club's reach in providing support for young musicians and underrepresented composers. From 1968 she established a \\"Young Artists in Performance\\" series, as well as from 1973 a concert program at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts showcasing young artists, both of which were often broadcast on WNYC. Under Koussevitsky's leadership the club also put on multiple concerts showcasing works by women composers, often exclusively American. Koussevitzky resigned the presidency in 1975 for health reasons and was succeeded by Sylvia Rabinof. In 1979, the Musicians Club reincorporated as a non-profit organization and received a grant from the Koussevitzky Foundation. Koussevitzky's involvement in the American International Music Fund (AIM), which administered the Koussevitzky International Recording Award (KIRA), also led to the organization being merged into the Musicians Club a year after her death in 1978. KIRA was established to award prizes for recorded works by contemporary composers, and since the acquisition has been awarded to composers such as Lucia Dlugoszewski (1980), Sofia Gubaidulina (1989 and 1993) and Stephen Jaffe (2004), as well as more well-known composers such as Pierre Boulez (1984) and Witold Lutos≈Çawski (1986).  Present day  The Musicians Club continues administering the Young Artist Awards, and in 2017 inaugurated the Dorothy Indenbaum Women Composers series. They also present an annual \\"Member-Composers Concert\\" that showcases works by current club members. Member-composers from recent years have included Leonard Lehrman, Mira Spektor, and Kermit Moore.

She is considered as one of the most important female video artists of China, and has been active since the late 1990s.  Early life  Kan was born in Xuancheng, Anhui Province. She studied from 1993 to 1997 at the China Academy of Art, in Hangzhou, where she was part of the evolution of video art from its inception in China. Two of her teachers were Geng Jianyi and Zhang Peili. During this time she became friends with video artists already renowned at the time, such as Zhang Peili. She moved to Shanghai after graduating from the China Academy of Art and then moved to Beijing in 1998. To maintain a living, Kan Xuan also did many other jobs such as sculpture assistant, and also worked at a movie production company. It was there she learned how to use the computer, video making, and 3D editing.  Career  In 1998, she went to Beijing and worked for a sculpture factory and various film production companies. She participated in her first major group exhibition by showing her still frame video work \\"Kan Xuan! - Eh!\\" at the \\"Art for Sale\\" exhibition in 1999, which was one of the most innovative experimental art exhibitions to take place in China at the time. Kan completed a residency at the Rijksakademie van Beeldende Kunsten in Amsterdam from 2002 to 2003. She received the Netherlands‚Äô Prix de Rome in 2005. During her time in the Netherlands, she created works that focus on the concepts of liberation, globalization and its impact on economy. Much of her work examined the differences between China and the West, rich and poor, and effects of commercialization, which she explored in her 1999 work \\"Garbage\\" and 2006-2009 work \\"Island\\". In 2009, she returned to Beijing, where she worked on large scale installations about Chinese history. She travelled extensively throughout China while making many short documentary films about important traditions that are often ignored in the present time. A notable aspect of her work at exhibition \\"Yellow Signal: New Media in China\\" (2012) at The Vancouver International Centre for Contemporary Asian Art was an exploration of Zen spirituality. Artistic style Kan Xuan is often directly associated with the cool end of China's new media and video art. Yet opportunities to see her work, especially in Mainland China have been rare. Her first show in Beijing (2003), when her work Looking, Looking, Looking (2002) was included as a part of a touring exhibition named \\"Under Construction\\". In the next few years, some of her works were shown in and around 798. Kan is often featured in her videos. She uses her personal experience as a way to convey the concepts of the works. Her early low-tech handheld camera-work brought an intimacy and beauty to seemingly trivial elements from everyday life. She quietly and humorously expresses immediate sensual experiences in unique visual angles, to an effect of sense altering and thought-provoking narratives. The artist's modest character is reflected through her work as a subtle, succinct nature; becoming a combination of understated visual components and a consciously slight choice of motifs brought to exploring profound ideas. Kan often plays with ambiguity and dissonance. Although her works are often short and simple, they allude to a deeper sense of spiritualism. In her own words, \\"it is about trying to become closer to and trying to follow, in every moment, my wish to exist in that distance between ‚Äòthinking‚Äô and ‚Äòfeeling‚Äô.\\"  Personal life  Currently, Kan divides her time between Beijing and Amsterdam.

A single prototype of the weapon was manufactured and saw service with the Norwegian Army during the Norwegian Campaign in 1940. Design details Johan Emil Barbat Eriksen was employed by the Norwegian armaments factory Kongsberg V√•penfabrikk and worked on several automatic weapon projects in his spare time, one of which was the Eriksen M/25. The Eriksen M/25 was long, with a barrel length of . It weighed and fired 6.5√ó55mm rounds. The rate of fire is unknown. The design of the action of the weapon combined functions of several different machine guns of the same era. The action consisted of a sliding breech block connected to a rotary crank, which in turn was operated by an off-set connecting rod, driven by the piston rod of the weapon. The feeding system was also unconventional, utilizing a box magazine mounted on the left side of the gun, holding 10 stripper clips with five rounds each. The stripper clips were fed one at a time through the gun from left to right where the empty clips were ejected (Japanese type 11 light machine gun utilised similar feature). It used the rear sight and the barrel of the Krag‚ÄìJ√∏rgensen rifle. Operational use A prototype of the design was built in 1925, and was probably the only unit ever manufactured. It was sent to the British Committee of Investigation of Small Arms for trials in 1927, but did not receive approval. The British showed limited interest in the weapon from the outset, decided against procuring 6.5√ó55mm ammunition, and thus limited their testing to examination of the prototype without test firing. Eriksen patented his inventions in the United Kingdom. The prototype was used by the Norwegian Army fighting German forces in the Norwegian Campaign in 1940. This specific weapon was issued to Sergeant H√•kon Lunde on 14 April 1940 when he was mobilized at Raufoss, and he carried it for several days before hiding it in Oslo. The gun remained hidden until the end of the Second World War in Europe in May 1945, when Lunde brought it back to his house and kept it. In 1996 Lunde gave the Eriksen M/25 prototype to the Royal Norwegian Navy Museum, which refurbished and exhibited it. The magazine for the weapon was lost before the gun was donated to the museum.

She sat as a member of the national parliament (\\"Reichstag\\") between 1930 and 1933, and was a senior party official in the Soviet occupation zone / German Democratic Republic after 1945. Life Marie Albrecht was born in Siersleben, a small town in the countryside northwest of Halle. Although the little town is surrounded by arable land, it is on the edge of a large coal field, and her father worked as a miner. After leaving school she undertook farm work and worked in clothes making. In 1917 she married Hermann Ahlers. In 1918 she joined the Independent Social Democratic Party (\\"Unabh√§ngige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / USPD) which had broken away from the mainstream Social Democratic Party following intense and sustained disagreement within the party following a leadership decision to operate a parliamentary truce for the duration of the war. The next year she joined the Young Socialists. 1919 was also the year in which she was excluded from church membership. In 1920 she joined both the Young Communists and the newly founded Communist Party itself. From the foundation of the \\"Red Front Women's and Girls' League\\" (RFMB), which was the women's section of the quasi- military \\"Red Front Fighters' Alliance\\" (\\"Roter Frontk√§mpferbund\\") she was a member of its national leadership. Between 1929 and 1933 she served as a town councillor in Eisleben and a member of the enlarged women's secretariat of the Communist Party. She also served, between 1930 and 1933, as a member of the national parliament (\\"Reichstag\\"), representing the Merseburg electoral district. The political backdrop changed abruptly in January 1933 when the Nazi party took power and lost little time in creating a one-party state. The Reichstag fire at the end of February 1933 was instantly blamed, by the authorities, on \\"communists\\": politicians with a known communist past found themselves targeted for surveillance and worse. Ahlers did not stand for re- election to the Reichstag in March 1933, the results of which were in any case arranged to give the Nazis a small overall majority in what now became an assembly of greatly diminished relevance. Ahlers found herself persecuted for her involvement in \\"national high treason\\" (\\"Hoch- und Landesverrates\\", Communist Party work being now illegal) and for a time lived illegally (unregistered and in hiding). War ended in May 1945, with a large territory in central Germany now administered as the Soviet occupation zone. Communist Party membership and activism were legal for the first time since 1933. Ahlers worked for the party's administration in the Berlin-Tegel quarter and became the leader of the \\"Antifascist Women's Committee\\" there. Following the contentious political merger which became the creation, in April 1946, of the Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED), Ahlers was one of hundreds of thousands of Communist Party members in the Soviet zone who lost no time in signing their party membership across to the SED, which by October 1949 would have become the ruling party in a new kind of German one party dictatorship, the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic. Having joined the SED, she became a member of its local leadership team for Lower Barnim. Between 1948 and 1953 she served as \\"second chair\\" on the national executive of the Agriculture and Forestry Union. Individual trades unions were relatively powerless, but her position as a representative of one of the fourteen recognised trades union s in East Germany made her a member of the ruling body of the important Free German Trade Union Federation (\\"Freier Deutsche Gewerkschaftsbund\\" / FDGB). Between 1958 and 1963 Marie Ahlers was a member of the ruling party's Audit Commission. Personal After 1930 Marie Ahlers lived with Gerhard Taubenheim (1891‚Äì1973). They married in 1945, when she took his name.

Early life and career Priamo Leonardi was born in Borgotaro, near Parma, in 1888, and entered the Italian Naval Academy at Livorno in 1907. He was commissioned as an ensign in 1911, and in the same year he participated in the Italo-Turkish War on board the armoured cruiser Amalfi.Dizionario Biografico Uomini della Marina Militare. After promotion to Lieutenant, Leonardi participated in World War I, first serving on board the armoured cruiser Francesco Ferruccio, then on the battleship Duilio and later in the Albania Naval High Command. In 1920 he obtained his first command, a torpedo boat. Between 1926 and 1928, having been promoted to Lieutenant Commander, Leonardi commanded the destroyers Monfalcone and Francesco Crispi; in 1928 he was promoted to Commander and assigned to the Intelligence Office of the Regia Marina Headquarters. Between 1933 and 1934 he commanded the Leone-class destroyer Tigre in the Red Sea, and between 1934 and 1935 he was the commanding officer of the minelayer Lepanto, stationed in Shanghai. In 1936 Leonardi was promoted to Captain and given command of the light cruiser Bartolomeo Colleoni. He remained in command of Colleoni till 1938, taking part in the Spanish Civil War; in 1938, he became commander of the colonial ship Eritrea, stationed in the Red Sea. World War II and aftermath When World War II broke out, Leonardi was the deputy commander of the La Spezia Arsenal. Later on, he became chief of staff of the Northern Adriatic Naval Department, and was promoted to Rear Admiral in 1942. In January 1943, following the Axis occupation of Vichy France, he became commander of the newly established Italian Naval Command in Toulon, as well as chief of staff of the Provence Naval Department. On 8 June 1943, Leonardi was appointed commander of the Augusta-Syracuse Naval Fortress Area. This was the most heavily armed fortress in Sicily, with six coastal batteries of large and medium caliber (381 mm, 254 mm, 152 mm), 17 anti-aircraft batteries (102 and 76 mm guns), two armed pontoons (armed with 149 and 190 mm guns) on the seaward side; like many fortresses and bases of the Regia Marina, however, whereas the seaward side was strongly fortified, the defences on the landward side were far weaker.Giorgio Giorgerini, La guerra italiana sul mare. La Marina tra vittoria e sconfitta 1940-1943, pp. 398-399. The landward defence perimeter, 50 km long, consisted of a chain of 30 coastal strongholds manned by two coastal battalions. When the Allied forces landed in Sicily, on 10 July 1943, no amphibious landing was carried out against Augusta; to avoid facing the formidable coastal defences of Augusta, a column of the Eighth Army landed between Avola and Pachino and then attacked Syracuse from the weakly defended landward side, across the Anapo river.Operation Ladbroke. Airborne troops also took part in the attack against Augusta and Syracuse in Operation Ladbroke. Admiral Leonardi tried to stem the British advance with tumultuary troops, but to little avail, as he had no artillery (Augusta, as mentioned, was only armed with coastal and anti-aircraft batteries: the former could be useful to repel an amphibious landing, and the latter against aircraft, but both were useless against a ground attack) or organic troops. While British forces steamrolled towards Syracuse and the interior, Leonardi tried to organize a counter-attack in co-operation with German units, but on the night between 10 and 11 July ‚Äì while Leonardi was absent from Augusta, having gone in the backcountry to organize the counter-attack ‚Äì many the troops that manned the Augusta defences, and especially the units of the Coastal Artillery Militia (MILMART, a Blackshirt branch tasked with coastal defense, whose personnel was recruited locally, and whose morale was particularly low because of the dire conditions of their families and their fear of being executed for being Fascist) abandoned their posts, blew up batteries and fortifications, disbanded and went home. When he was informed of this, Leonardi put together some units with second-line troops and dispersed soldiers and tried again to organize a defense together with German units; he \\"spent the next few days dashing from unit to unit, to bolster morale and to keep in touch with his disparate and dispersed forces\\", and at one point, on 12 July, he personally reactivated an abandoned MILMART battery and opened fire on the first British destroyer that entered Augusta harbour. These movements, however, also had the effect of preventing many subordinates from contacting him, causing further confusion. The abandonment and destruction of the coastal batteries enabled the Royal Navy to land troops directly in Augusta; despite fierce fighting in some areas, both Augusta and Syracuse fell by 13 July. Leonardi himself was captured by British forces six days later and sent to a POW camp in Great Britain, where he remained till November 1944. The command of the Sixth Army, tasked with the defense of Sicily, held Leonardi responsible of the fall of the Augusta-Syracuse fortress and proposed a court-martial for him, but no trial was held. The Sal√≤ Republic, however, looking for scapegoats in the military to justify the defeat of Italy, branded Leonardi as a traitor and a coward, falsely accusing him of having ordered the destruction of the coastal batteries and having surrendered Augusta without a fight; he was tried and sentenced to death in absentia by a Fascist kangaroo court in May 1944. After the end of the war, in November 1945, a formal enquiry was held on Leonardi's behaviour; the enquiry concluded that the admiral had done everything he could during the invasion of Sicily, and in 1947 he was awarded a Silver Medal of Military Valor. Having been promoted to Vice Admiral (Ammiraglio di Divisione) in 1945, Leonardi was placed in reserve in the following year; in 1958 he was promoted to full Admiral (Ammiraglio di Squadra), Reserve. He died in Parma on 16 March 1984.

The Line of Contact (, shp‚Äôman gits, ) separates the Armenian forces (namely the Nagorno-Karabakh Defense Army) and the Azerbaijan Armed Forces in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. It was formed in the aftermath of the May 1994 ceasefire that ended the Nagorno-Karabakh War (1988‚Äì94). The mountain range of Murovdag is the northern part of the line of contact and is essentially a natural border between the two forces. The length of the line of contact is between and . Terminology The term \\"Line of Contact\\" is widely used in official documents and statements, including by the OSCE Minsk Group. Some Armenian analysts, including Ara Papian encourage the Armenian side to avoid the term \\"line of contact\\", instead calling it a \\"state border\\" between Artsakh and Azerbaijan. Independent journalist and author Tatul Hakobyan writes of it as a state border of Azerbaijan and Artsakh and notes it is called the \\"line of contact\\" in international lexicon. In Azerbaijan, the ‚Äúline of contact‚Äù is often referred to as the ‚Äúline of occupation‚Äù in accordance with designating Nagorno-Karabakh as an occupied territory. Description The line of contact was, immediately after the ceasefire, a \\"relatively quiet zone with barbed wire and lightly armed soldiers sitting in trenches\\", according to Thomas de Waal. There was also a relatively large no-man's land after the ceasefire which was several kilometers wide in some places. It was reduced to a few hundred meters in most areas of the line of contact due to Azerbaijani redeployments into the former neutral zone. By contrast, in 2016, there were around 20,000 men on each side of the heavily militarized line of contact. Since the ceasefire the line of contact has become a heavily militarized, fortified and mined no-man's-land and a buffer zone of trenches. According to de Waal, it is the \\"most militarised zone in the wider Europe,\\" and one of the three most militarized zones in the world (along with Kashmir and Korea). The trenches along the line of contact have been extensively compared to those of World War I. The line of contact is regularly monitored by a group of six OSCE observers, headed by Andrzej Kasprzyk of Poland. There are exchanges of fire virtually on a daily basis. There have been significant violations of the ceasefire on various occasions, usually characterized by low-intensity fighting. Significant fighting occurred in April 2016, when for the first time since the ceasefire the line of contact was shifted, though not significantly. According to Laurence Broers of Chatham House \\"Although slivers of territory changed hands for the first time since 1994, little of strategic significance appears to have altered on the ground.\\" The 2016 clashes also marked the first time since the 1994 ceasefire that heavy artillery was used, while the 2020 Nagorno- Karabakh conflict saw use of heavy artillery, armoured warfare, and drone warfare. On October 9, 2020, when President Ilham Aliyev addressed the nation, he stated, \\"There is no status quo. There is no line of contact. We smashed it.\\"https://azertag.az/en/xeber/President_Ilham_Aliyev_addressed_the_nation_VIDEO-1608897 Impact According to Kolosov and Zotova (2020), \\"the deployment of military units along the separation line, the special regime of the border zone on both sides, constant skirmishes, and the destruction during the war and immediately after it of a number of cities and other settlements turned the border territories into an economic desert.\\" According to the International Crisis Group, all of 150,000 Karabakh Armenians are \\"within reach of Azerbaijani missiles and artillery shells\\", while around twice the number of Azerbaijanis (300,000) \\"live in the 15km-wide zone along the Azerbaijani side of the line of contact.\\" =Travel advisory= *: \\"Casualties continue to occur in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.

Consular support is not available in the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Although a ceasefire has been in place since May 1994, the borders between Armenia and Azerbaijan and Azerbaijani territory occupied by Armenian forces are closed. There are no peacekeeping forces separating the sides. There are regular exchanges of sniper fire and some skirmishes.

Early life The son of Alexander Mitchell Moir and of Scottish descent, he was born in London and was educated at University College School. At a young age he showed a great interest in mechanics and became expert in mechanical and engineering work while in college. Aged about 15, Moir joined the engineering works of Messrs. Robert Napier and Sons in Glasgow where he served an apprenticeship as a mechanical engineer. He studied engineering at University College London before joining the firm of William Arrol in Glasgow where he started in the drawing office. In his early career he also came into close contact with John Fowler, Benjamin Baker and John Wolfe Barry.Obituary for Ernest William Moir ‚Äì Nature 131, 901‚Äì901 (24 June 1933) Engineering projects Moir's airlock of 1889 first used while building the Hudson River Tunnel in New York City Moir was the assistant to James Henry Greathead (1844‚Äì96) on the building of the London (City) & Southwark Subway, later the City & South London Railway (and now part of the Northern line) in the late 1880s. He was also involved in the construction of the southern cantilevers of the Forth Bridge. After British consulting engineering expertise was required at the Hudson River Tunnel in New York City, Sir Benjamin Baker provided a report which facilitated $1.5 million of British investment, and in 1889 construction resumed with a contract let to British contractor S. Pearson & Son; Moir was originally resident engineer working for Sir William Arrol and designed an 80-ton steel tunnelling shield for each tunnel at Baker's directions. Moir became contractor‚Äôs agent (for S. Pearson & Son) in January 1890, working there until British engineering efforts were suspended in 1891.Hudson River Tunnel ‚Äì Engineering Timelines While in New York from May 1890 Moir invented an airlock chamber for treating decompression sickness when he noticed that about 25% of the workforce digging the Hudson River Tunnel were dying and was surprised to note that \\"nobody has seemed to care anything about it.\\" He realised that the solution was recompression and his airlock was quickly applied throughout the industry. While Moir's treatment was effective it was too fast by modern standards but he began the process which would lead to the effective treatment of decompression sickness.John L.

Later projects included expansion of the Surrey Commercial Docks and Seaham harbour, the Admiralty harbour at Dover (officially opened in 1909), and Valparaiso harbour in Chile. He gained the rank of Captain in the Royal Engineers (Volunteers) and was put on the Unattached List in 1908.Unattached List for the Territorial Force ‚Äì 20 November 1908 London Gazette p8548 Among his patents was one for a diving bell in 1921. War service Moir was appointed to the Council of the Minister of Munitions during World War I by David Lloyd George (pictured). During World War I Moir served on the Council of the Minister of Munitions for which service he was decorated with the award of Officer in the Legion of Honour. Described by David Lloyd George as \\"a man of exceptional ability and tact\\", initially Moir was responsible to Eric Geddes for machine gun production. Later Lloyd George appointed Moir to the Inventions Department of the Ministry of Munitions. Announcing this appointment to the House of Commons on 28 July 1915, Lloyd George stated: > I have appointed Mr E.W. Moir, a distinguished engineer who has already > given valuable assistance to my department on a voluntary basis, to take > charge of the new branch, and he will not only have an expert staff, but > also a panel of scientific consultants on technical and scientific points. However, Moir quickly found that the War Office was not inclined to co-operate fully with the Ministry. He wrote to Lloyd George about this in March 1915 which Lloyd George reprinted in full in his War Memoirs, using it as evidence of the difficulties and obstructiveness he had encountered as Minister of Munitions during the War.Clarke, John M. London's Necropolis: A Guide to Brookwood Cemetery, Sutton Publishing (2004), p. 74 The Moir Baronetcy, of Whitehanger in the parish of Fernhurst in the County of Sussex, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 11 July 1916 for him. Moir produced a design for concrete machine-gun pillboxes. Designed to be constructed from a system of interlocking precast concrete blocks, with a steel roof, around 1500 Moir pillboxes were eventually produced (with blocks cast at Richborough in Kent) and sent to the Western Front in 1918. Moir was the founder and head of Ernest William Moir & Co Ltd, engineers, and a Director of S Pearson & Son Ltd and was President of the Junior Institution of Engineers (a forerunner, 1902‚Äì1970, of the Institution of Incorporated Engineers, later the IET) in 1929. During the 1920s, he also helped one of the first female civil engineers meet Institution of Civil Engineers requirements that design engineers have site experience; Dorothy Donaldson Buchanan left London to work on the Silent Valley Reservoir project in Northern Ireland,Trevor Turpin, Dam (Reaktion Books 2008): 94-95. and was supervised by Moir, eventually becoming the first female member of the ICE in 1927. Family life Grade II listed Moir family grave in Brookwood Cemetery Moir married Margaret Bruce Pennycook (1862‚Äì1942) on 1 June 1887. Ernest William Moir died in 1933 aged 79 and is buried in the family plot at Brookwood Cemetery under a monument which is Grade II listed.

The angel sculpture surmounting the pedestal is by Lilian Wade. He was succeeded to the title by his second son, Sir Arrol Moir (1894‚Äì1957), named after William Arrol, his first benefactor. He was survived by his wife Margaret, Lady Moir OBE, who described herself as \\"an engineer by marriage\\" as she had travelled with her husband on his many engineering projects. During World War I she organised the Weekend Relief Work Scheme whereby substitute workers covered for the women working in munitions factories allowing them time off.

He was killed in an accident in Madras when he was thrown from his horse. Early life Elder, was born in Invernesshire. He wished to joined the British Army as an ensign in the about to be embodied Highland Corps. However he was disappointed in his just expectations, and a temporary bar was placed to his ardent desire to join the Army, but his decided military bent, and qualifications, were not unobserved; and in November, 1800, he was appointed to a Second Lieutenancy in the Experimental Corps of Riflemen, commanded by Colonel Coote Manningham. Stationed in England In the Rifles, Lieutenant Elder met with congenial spirits, and had the happiness to associate with several who have since, like himself, by their gallantry and talents, arrived at a very high rank in the service, and who have invariably evinced towards their brave comrade the warmest regard and satisfaction at his deserved success. Colonel Manningham's corps was trained at Weymouth, under the eye of George III, who, showed a warm interest in its progress to a high state of efficiency and discipline. Lieutenant Elder's uniform good conduct and strict attention to his duty procured for him the particular approbation of Sir Sidney Beckwith, who was desirous that so deserving an officer should obtain by purchase a First Lieutenancy then for sale in the corps; but Lieutenant Elder's sense of independence and of duty to his family would not allow him to apply for the required sum, much to the disappointment of his excellent friend Sir Sidney. However, Lieutenant Elder going, shortly after, on leave of absence, and another First Lieutenancy (in 1803) offering for purchase. Sir Sidney Beckwith most generously and delicately (without naming the matter to his protege) advanced the money for its attainment, and the promotion took place. The price of this step was subsequently repaid, accompanied with the grateful acknowledgments of Lieutenant Elder's brother. While stationed at Shorncliffe Army Camp, in 1805, under the command of the Sir John Moore, Lieutenant Elder's assiduity in the performance of his duties, and the excellent state of discipline to which he had brought his company, so attracted the attention of that General Moore, that on the occasion of the militia being allowed to volunteer for the line, he was pleased to say that he would recommend Lieutenant Elder to the Commander-in-Chief for a company, if successful in obtaining men (for which duty he was detached), and on his return with the prescribed number, he was promoted to a company in the 2nd battalion 95th Rifles. South American Expedition Captain Elder's company formed part of the detachment from the Rifle corps employed on the expedition to South America in 1806. The Naval and Military Gazette alludes to Captain Elder's services at Monte Video in the following terms: Captain Elder further had the good fortune to be most favourably noticed for his zeal and ability by Brigadier-General Robert Craufurd, who, on the disembarkation of the troops in the Bay of Barragon, personally inspected the manner in which the sentries had been posted, which called forth the General's marked approbation; and he declared that had he himself placed them, he could not have done it better. At the same time asking the name of the officer who had performed that duty, he was informed it was Captain Elder. On the pursuit of the enemy by Brigadier- General Craufurd, Captain Elder was requested to reconnoitre a position, and while engaged on this service, a party of the enemy who had concealed themselves in a trench, fired on Captain Elder, and wounded him dangerously in the groin. He fell instantly; when the Brigadier-General seeing it, and believing him killed, exclaimed, \\"There falls as brave and gallant a fellow as ever lived!\\". Elder was carried off the field, and for a considerable time doubts were entertained of his ever recovering. He had lost entirely the use of his limbs, but the strength of his iron constitution brought him through. The ball was never extracted, but was supposed to have lodged near the spine, and he often suffered great pain from its effects. Captain Elder acted as a witness in Whitlocke¬¥s court-martial after the failure on invasion of Buenos Aires. Peninsular War In 1808 Captain Elder joined the army under Sir John Moore in the Peninsula, and was almost daily engaged with the enemy while covering the retreat of the Army upon Corunna. He embarked for England after the battle of Corunna (in which he was engaged) with the remains of his corps; and in April, 1809, being one of the twenty officers originally chosen, he was promoted to a majority, and appointed by Marshal Beresford to the command of the 3rd battalion of Ca√ßadores in the Portuguese Army, with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in that service. It was said that \\"in the 95th he was beloved and respected by every officer and soldier in the corps, and all viewed his honours and promotions with delight\\", and on leaving, the company he had commanded presented Major Elder with a silver-mounted sabre, suitably inscribed, as a memorial of their respect and gratitude. Lieutenant-Colonel Elder was indefatigable in training and disciplining his battalion, and when their improvement was considerably advanced, Lord Wellington and Marshal Beresford reviewed them, when his Lordship said to him, \\"Colonel Elder, the Marshal and myself are under great obligations to you for the fine state of discipline to which you have brought your battalion, and to your country you have rendered a most essential service\\". At the commencement of the Portuguese campaign, the 3rd battalion of Ca√ßadores was attached to the Light Division in advance of the Allied Army. On 18 July 1810, in the affair of Almeida, Lieutenant-Colonel Elder received the congratulations of Major-General Craufurd for the gallant conduct of his battalion in an attack upon two squadrons of French cavalry who were nearly destroyed. During this affair the remainder of the Light Division cheered the Ca√ßadores from an eminence in the rear. On 24 July, in the severe action of the C√¥a, the 3rd battalion was particularly mentioned in Orders by Marshal Beresford, who, in thanking the Commanding Officer and corps, observed that \\"their brilliant conduct on that occasion was in every respect equal to that of British troops\\". On the evening preceding the Battle of Busaco, the 3rd Ca√ßadores were closely engaged with the enemy's advance in front of the position, when Lieutenant-Colonel Elder's horse was shot under him. During the battle, the 3rd Ca√ßadores were engaged for the whole of 27 September, and the morning of the 28th, Wellington in his orders was pleased to say that \\"the 3rd Ca√ßadores, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Elder, have added to their former reputation by their gallant behaviour, which was admired not only by his Excellency, but by the Army in general\\". While the Army retired on the Lines of Torres Vedras, the 3rd Ca√ßadores distinguished themselves particularly at Alenquer, where, owing to a heavy rain and thick fog, the French succeeded in entering the village unobserved. Here the Ca√ßadores promptly formed, and taking possession of a height commanding the bridge, held it against a division of the enemy, until that part of the Allied Army occupying Alenquer had time to form and retreat to their respective stations. From the arrival of the Allied Army in the lines of Torres Vedras, Lieutenant-Colonel Elder's corps occupied the outposts of the light division; and on Massena's retreat to the position of Santarem, it covered the advance of the Army, and was on several occasions closely engaged with the rear-guard of the enemy. Whilst the French Army were in the position of Santarem (upwards of three months) Lieutenant-Colonel Elder was entrusted with the occupation of the bridge and two forts of Ponte Solario, the most advanced post of the Allied Army, and to which the greatest responsibility was attached. During this service the corps equalled the expectations formed of it. On the retreat of the enemy from Santarem, Lieutenant-Colonel Elder, always in advance, had repeatedly the honour of being opposed to the Marshal Ney, and while thus employed, took, and kept possession of the Castle of Pombal until the arrival of the Allied Army. Here he maintained his position for upwards of ten hours against the rear-guard of the enemy, consisting of, at least, ten thousand men, and the loss sustained by the 3rd Ca√ßadores was very considerable; but Lieutenant-Colonel Elder and his corps received the thanks of the Commander-in-Chief, and the praise of the whole Army. On the day following Elder was engaged with the right of the enemy's advanced posts, and Lord Wellington was pleased to state in General Orders, \\"that he had never witnessed a more brilliant attack than that made by the 52nd Regiment, and Lieutenant-Colonel Elder's Ca√ßadores, in driving the enemy from the heights of Redinha\\". On 13 March 1811 his battalion was ordered to turn the enemy's right flank on the position of the Serra d'Estrella, and falling in with them at Chao da Lama (whilst they were attacked in front by the light division), he participated in driving them from the heights. On the following evening, 15 March 1811, the Ca√ßadores composed a part of the troops which attacked the enemy with such rapidity at Foz d'Arouce that they were thrown into confusion; and in crossing the river they lost an eagle, and a number of men and officers were drowned. Lieutenant-Colonel Elder's corps was again engaged in the skirmish at Guarda; and in the attack at Sabugal (3 April 1811) it forded the river in two places in front of the light division, driving in the enemy's advanced pickets. Lieutenant-Colonel Elder received the thanks of Lord Wellington in the field, and afterwards in Orders, for his conduct on that occasion. The Allied Army going into quarters on the frontiers of Portugal, Lieutenant-Colonel Elder, with the 3rd Cacadores, was sent in advance to the village of Espeja, in Spain, and there they distinguished themselves by repulsing, in square, an attack of seven squadrons of the enemy's cavalry, who suffered severely in killed and wounded. The corps was publicly thanked by General Craufurd for their steady and determined conduct on that day. In the battle of Fuentes d'Onore, on the morning of 5 May 1811, Lieutenant-Colonel Elder was engaged in covering the light division in the wood on the right of the line, from whence they were obliged to retire in square, being attacked by nearly the whole of the enemy's cavalry. After the battle Elder was recommended for, and appointed, in May, 1811, to a British Lieutenant- Colonelcy, as a remuneration for his services. From this period until the investment of Ciudad Rodrigo, Lieutenant Colonel Elder's corps was constantly in the advance, and had many opportunities of attracting the notice of the Commander of the forces. The 3rd Ca√ßadores was the first corps that broke ground before that fortress; and in the storming and capture it had the honour of leading the light division to the assault under a tremendous fire, carrying, besides their arms, 300 sacks of hay, which they placed in the ditch, and immediately mounted the breach. On their gaining the square, they were publicly thanked by General Picton (commanding the attack) for their gallant conduct, which, besides being praised by Marshal Beresford in Orders, was also particularly mentioned in Lord Wellington's dispatch of 28 January 1812, wherein, after recording the merits of various officers, Wellington wrote, \\"Lieutenant-Colonel Elder and the 3rd Ca√ßadores were likewise distinguished on this occasion\\". At the storming of Badajoz, Lieutenant- Colonel Elder, led a brigade, composed of the 1st and 3rd battalions of Ca√ßadores, and five companies of his old regiment the 95th, to the great breach, where he fell desperately wounded. He was left on the spot for dead, the troops passing over his body. Returning animated with blaze of fire around him, enabled Colonel Elder to distinguish members of the 95th; and he had just strength enough to call out \\"Elder, Elder!\\" when two of his former company lifted him up and carried him into Badajoz, where he was for a considerable time confined by his wounds, which brought on Tetanus (lockjaw). The particulars of his almost miraculous recovery from the effects of his wounds, owing to the skilful treatment and incessant attention of his friend. Dr. Charles Fergusson Forbes, are vividly depicted in The Table-Talk of an Old Campaigner, written by that Forbes, and published in this Journal for September, 1834. Being in a precarious state, owing to the severe nature of his wounds, Lieutenant-Colonel Elder was obliged to return to England; but previously to his departure from the Peninsula he was made Knight-Commander of the Order of the Tower and Sword by the Regency of Portugal; and the Prince Regent of the United Kingdom was pleased to confer the honour of knighthood on him soon after his arrival back in England. In 1813, while yet in a state of convalescence, Sir George Elder rejoined the army. On his arrival in France, he was promoted to the rank of Colonel, and appointed to the command of the 7th Regiment of Portuguese infantry. He was engaged in several skirmishes and affairs of posts. At the very end of the Campaign in south-west France (1814), Elder, at the head of a body of troops‚Äîupwards of three thousand‚Äîhe captured the Fortress of Blaye, (on the right bank of the river Gironde downstream of Bordeau ); and the terms of capitulation dictated by Elder to the governor of it‚ÄîGeneral De Haveland, commanding the 11th division‚Äîwere much approved of by Lord Dalhousie, under whose immediate command he was then serving. At the peace of 1814, Sir George Elder accompanied the Portuguese Army on their return to their native country, when he was, in 1816, promoted to the rank of brigadier in that service, and subsequently to that of Major-General, with the command of a brigade (the 5th) in the Alemtejo. Postbellum On the distribution of honours by the Prince Regent, Sir George Elder was decorated with the Gold Cross of the Peninsular Gold Medal for the general actions and assaults of Busaco, Fuentes d'Onore, Ciudad Rodrigo, and Badajoz. Elder left Portugal in 1823, but visited it again in 1830, when he was received with marks of high distinction by its Sovereign, the court, and the brave officers and men who had gained renown under his guidance, or had witnessed his gallant deeds. He had received nine wounds in battle, eight of which were considered dangerous or severe, and for them Sir George Elder had been granted a pension from the British Government, which was continued until a regulation was made that only those who had lost a limb, or had suffered injuries which should be deemed equivalent to it, might continue to enjoy such allowance. But George IV, in consideration of his sufferings, conferred on him the appointment of Lieutenant-Governor of St. John's, Newfoundland. Sir George Elder was promoted to the rank of Major General in 1830, on which occasion William IV nominated him a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath; and he received the Star of a Spanish order from Ferdinand VII in addition to that of the Tower and Sword. Death In August 1836 Major-General Sir George Elder left England, having been selected to serve on the staff at Madras. On 3 December, just one week after he arrived in Madras, he died in a horse riding accident: He was followed to the grave, with every mark of honour and respect, by the military and civil authorities, and a large portion of the population of Madras.

Centered on the junction of United States Route 7 with Harbor and Falls Roads, the district's architecture traces the town's history from the 18th to early 20th century. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Description and history The town of Shelburne was chartered in 1763, and first surveyed by Ira Allen. Early settlers fled the area during the American Revolutionary War, and permanent settlement resumed in the 1780s. Benjamin Harrington, an early settler, owned and farmed the land where the village is located. He laid out the stagecoach route between Rutland and Burlington (now roughly US 7) in the 1790s, and built the Shelburne Inn. The community remained agricultural until the advent of the railroad in 1849, with its center of industry a mile to the southeast at Shelburne Falls. The village's greatest period of development was between about 1880 and 1910, when industry developed near the railroad, and the town benefited from the philanthropy of the Shelburne Museum's founders, William Seward Webb and Electra Havemeyer Webb. with The historic district is centered at the junction of US 7 with Harbor Road and Falls Road. It extends north to the LaPlatte River, and south beyond Church Street. It includes properties on Church Street and Falls Road, and on Harbor Road just beyond the railroad tracks. It abuts the property of the Shelburne Museum to the southwest. It is about in size, and includes how many historic buildings. The oldest surviving building in the district is the 1796 Shelburne Inn, and Federal style houses are scattered throughout the village.

Nelson's style has been described as \\"socially critical, prolific, and satirically expressive.\\" Biography Nelson was born in Oakland Naval Hospital, one of three sons born to a Navy family, who as a result spent much time overseas during Nelson's childhood, including periods in Yokohama, Japan and Kahaluu, Oahu Island, Hawaii. At the age of 13, Nelson moved to the Panama Canal Zone. He began his art studies at the Panama Canal Zone College, then studied graphic design at la Universidad Nacional de Panama', studio arts at the Escuela Nacional de Artes Plasticas-Casco Viejo, and was mentored in theatrical design at the Ancon Theatre Guild, with productions directed by Bill Gonzalez. In 1984 he moved to the United States to study at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where he completed his Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1986. He remained in Chicago to complete his Masters from the University of Illinois at Chicago, where his studies culminated with a decade of interdisciplinary art installations. Inspired by his friend and fellow artist Francisco Mendoza to become a teaching artist, Nelson taught in the Chicago public school system as a resident artist and permanent instructor for 29 years, beginning with college work-study programs, 18 years teaching at Stone Academy, and five years at Schurz High School, retiring in June 2017. Additionally, Nelson has taught at Northeastern Illinois University, St. Augustine College, and Columbia College Chicago, and is currently adjunct faculty at Triton College, River Grove, Illinois. In 1998, Nelson acquired his GringoLandia Studio, and took up permanent residence within Pilsen Historic District. Nelson has been involved with the Pilsen artist community since the mid 1980s, and is one of the original artists who collaborated to create the 18th Street Pilsen Open Studios. Nelson's public works include the F22 DairyAir Enforcer from the 1999 \\"Cows on Parade\\" public art project, and a 2007 canvas mural entitled \\"Jesus Lizard on the Banana Channel\\" purchased by the U.S. State Department and installed in the new U.S. Consulate in the Republic of Panama. Nelson has also produced a number of short documentary films, principally for national parks in Arizona and South Dakota, where he works as a National Park Service Ranger during summers. His films on local topics, especially the Chicago Hispanic community, have been shown on Chicago Access Network Television. As well as various other grants and professional recognition, Nelson was awarded the 2014 Photography Program Award by the Chicago Photographic Society, the 2013 Oppy Award by the Oppenheimer Family Foundation, the 2008 Teacher of Distinction award by the Golden Apple Foundation, and the 2003 First Place Award by the Barrington Area Arts Council, as well as receiving the Illinois Arts Council Fellowship on two occasions.

Congressional Findings  The Congressional Committee identified four barriers to women owned businesses that they wished to address. # \\"the need for technical training to maximize growth potential of women owned business\\" # \\"inequality of access to commercial credit\\" # \\"virtual exclusion of women owned business from government procurement activities\\" # \\"inadequacy of information and data relative to women owned business\\" These findings were included in the Committee Report 100-736, which was filed on June 28, 1988. Findings like this are critical in order to formulate the basis for public policies and programs in order to benefit women entrepreneurs.  List of organizations that endorsed the legislation  * National Federation of Independent Businesses * National Small Business United * Small Business Legislative Council * National Association of Women's Business Owners * National Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs * Women Equity Action League * Black Women's Agenda  Outcomes of the Women's Business Ownership Act  = Women's Business Centers = The Women's Business Ownership Act provided seed funding for women's business centers through an annual grant process by the Small Business Administration. They were intended to provide technical assistance to women in order to form businesses, particularly those who were socially or economically disadvantaged. Women's business centers provide training, technical assistance, and support for entrepreneurship for women. The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor research project has consistently shown that women have lower entrepreneurship endeavors than men, but research on women's business centers indicate that the centers in the United States are accomplishing their intended mission. Women lack equal access to education, finance, and other support services, such as business networks. Women often also have to pay higher interest rates than men for similar loans. In addition to these logistical factors, women are often influenced by societal norms, such as being unlikely to be exposed to the concept of negotiation. The lack of resources for women entrepreneurs in daily assistance in the beginning stages of their businesses make it difficult for women to start businesses. As a result, women entrepreneurs are more likely than men to stay in business for only short periods of time. Women‚Äôs Business Centers seek to offer assistance with the day-to-day operations of starting a business, hoping to help women overcome the barriers they face to entrepreneurship. Since 1995, the Center for Women in Business Enterprise in Boston and Worcester have helped over 14,000 entrepreneurs. This is indicative of the demand for such services. Women's Business Center Program has had significant economic impact, with more than one half of the Centers showing growth in number of clients helped, gross receipts, profits, the creation of jobs, and new firms started. = National Women's Business Council = Created by the Women's Business Ownership Act, the National Women's Business Council is a non-partisan federal advisory board created to present policy advice about women small business issues to the President and Congress. It has resulted in the Census Bureau being required to include women business owners in its census survey. Established in 1988, it started as an advisory board intended to identify the barriers for women-owned businesses and report annually to the president and Congress. By the early 1990s, the National Women's Business Council included women business owners, policy makers, bankers, and representatives of women's business organizations in the discussion of potential solutions to the problems women-owned businesses face, which were then presented to the president and Congress. The Small Business Reauthorization Act changed the structure of the National Women's Business Council in 1994 to its current form, which includes women business owners and representatives of women's business organizations. The law was expanded in 1998 for the National Women's Business council to include the current fifteen members. The members of the National Women's Business Council are appointed to three year terms. The fifteen members include: * a chair appointed by the president * eight women business owners or chief executives (four in the same political party as the US president and four not) * six representatives of national women's business organizations ** Association of Women's Business Centers ** Astia ** National Association of Women Business Owners (NAWBO) ** Women's Business Enterprise National Council ** Women Impacting Public Policy (WIPP) ** Women Presidents' Organizations (WPO)  Race and the Women's Business Ownership Act  White women working on the legislation for the Women‚Äôs Business Ownership Act were concerned that adding amendments for women of color would make the bill too controversial to pass or ‚Äúputting race and sex together in the same legislation complicates the issue and might threaten the passage of the legislation.‚Äù This concern indicates the marginalization that women face, but also the additional barriers for women of color. The National Association of Women Business Owners (NAWBO) was a main proponent for the passing of the bill. NAWBO argued that stereotypes of women created barriers to women business owners. However, NAWBO was hesitant to include women of color to its ranks. They were nervous that, due to the political climate of the time, adding a racial component to what was already considered progressive legislation intended to address women‚Äôs issues would provoke push back from conservatives. The coalition eventually was convinced that it was important to include women of color because their interests could be addressed by NAWBO without also involving the community of minority men business owners. A small sub-coalition was created, which consisted of the Organization of Pan Asian American Women, the Black Women‚Äôs Agenda, and the Coalition of Minority Women in Business. Processes that are racialized and affect entrepreneurship are often gendered and classed as well. Residential segregation, racialized social networks, and wealth inequality influence blacks‚Äô entrepreneurial behavior by reducing their access to resources necessary to start businesses. These aspects are also influenced by gender and class. As of 2015, only about 5% of CEOs of Fortune 500 companies are women, and the majority are white. On average for full-time work, a white man will earn almost 56% more than a black woman. Black entrepreneurs understand their business ownership within a context of race, but also within the context of other social groups, like gender.  Socioeconomic Status and the Women's Business Ownership Act  Initially, women‚Äôs interest groups were accused of representing only middle- and upper-middle-class women when selecting issues to politically address. However, the interests of working class and poor women have received increased attention. Measures implemented by the Women‚Äôs Business Ownership Act, such as the Women's Business Centers, were intentionally implemented for women of lower socioeconomic status.  Affirmative Action for Women  Affirmative action programs are often used as a way to make the playing field equal for minority and women owned businesses, and can contribute to the ability for business entry and survival. These programs for women can be considered in terms of education, employment, and business ownership. For women business owners, affirmative action programs are considered legislation that encourage government agencies and contractors to do business with women-owned businesses. Programs that provide financial, management, and technical assistance to women business owners are also considered to be aspects of affirmative action. Affirmative action legislation has led to substantial improvements in the employment of minorities and women. While affirmative action independently is not enough to provide opportunities to those facing discrimination or marginalization, evidence suggests that it is beneficial in helping women and minorities to attain more education or economic gains. Ronald Reagan's administration from 1981 to 1989, or during the passage of the Women's Business Ownership Act, was adamantly opposed to affirmative action. There was a concern that the heavy opposition undermined the effectiveness of the policies. Research conducted after the abolition of affirmative action in Washington and California found evidence to suggest there were slight increases in self-employment among minorities and women with no affirmative action. This is believed to be due to the opportunity cost of starting a business falling because of the restricting opportunities in a traditional labor market. However, this may not be true when considering different race and gender groups.

Jackson Jr. (September 9, 1912 - February 13, 2001), known as Little Willie Jackson, was an American jazz and rhythm and blues saxophonist, bandleader and occasional vocalist. Life and career Jackson was born in Houston, Texas. He was blind, and took up the saxophone and clarinet. By the mid 1930s he was based in San Diego, California, where he played with pianist Joe Liggins in the Creole Serenaders. He and Liggins then moved to Los Angeles, and in the early 1940s they formed the Honeydrippers, a band that took its name from the song \\"The Honeydripper\\", which became a number one R&B; hit in 1945. Jackson was credited with both alto and baritone saxophone on the recording. Jackson also occasionally sang with the Honeydrippers, as on the 1946 single \\"Walkin'\\".Biography by Richie Unterberger, Jackson recorded several tracks as bandleader with the Honeydrippers, for Modern Records in 1947, when the company needed to record material to issue during the 1948 American Federation of Musicians recording ban. According to critic Richie Unterberger, they \\"straddled the line between the swing and jump blues eras, with a hefty dose of boogie... [but] Jackson was closer to jazz (and further removed from blues) than most...\\" Several of his recordings were versions of jazz songs first recorded in the 1920s or earlier, such as \\"I Ain't Got Nobody,\\" and \\"St. Louis Blues,\\" often in a style similar to Cab Calloway. Jackson continued to perform with Liggins and to record occasionally in the 1950s and 1960s, though the band's style became outmoded with the advent of rock and roll. His final recordings were in 1969, with Liggins on tracks recorded for Johnny Otis' Blues Spectrum label.

For reasons which are not entirely clear his position grew; perhaps as a host Florida presided over a Carlist emergency meeting of December 1936, called to deal with Franco's demand that Fal Conde leaves Spain.Jaime del Burgo Torres, Un episodio poco conocido de la guerra civil espa√±ola. La Real Academia Militar de Requet√©s y el destierro de Fal Conde, [in:] Principe de Viana 196 (1992), p. 496 It is not clear what position he took; some historians discussing the day refer to him as \\"Rodezno‚Äôs ally\\", which suggests that Florida proposed that the ultimatum be accepted.Martin Blinkhorn, Carlism and Crisis in Spain 1931-1939, Cambridge 2008, , p. 277 Francisco Franco during the Civil War Starting early 1937 the Carlists were facing a prospect of forced amalgamation into a state party; the claimant and the Falcondistas opted for intransigence, Rodezno and the Navarrese opted for negotiations. Florida was present at a February meeting in Insua and sided with the Rodeznistas,Robert Vallverd√∫ i Mart√≠, La metamorfosi del carlisme catal√†: del \\"D√©u, P√†tria i Rei\\" a l'Assamblea de Catalunya (1936-1975), Barcelona 2014, , p. 46 position maintained also in March.in March 1937 Consejo de la Tradici√≥√± decided to send a delegation to Franco informing him that Junta Nacional resigned and could be re-appointed according to his will; the envoys were Martinez Berasain, Marcelino Ulibarri and Jos√© Mar√≠a Garc√≠a Verde, Florida was not mentioned, Pe√±alba Sotorr√≠o 2013, pp. 42, 126 In early April he took part in a meeting of a somewhat rebellious Navarrese Junta Central; it adopted a Franco-addressed proposal suggesting a directorio, composed of Carlists, Falangists and caudillo's appointees.the meeting took place on 4 April 1937. The 12-member directorio was to composed of 3 Carlists, 3 Falangists and 6 appointees of Franco, Juan Carlos Pe√±as Bernaldo de Quir√≥s, El Carlismo, la Rep√∫blica y la Guerra Civil (1936-1937). De la conspiraci√≥n a la unificaci√≥n, Madrid 1996, , p. 262. It does not seem that at the time Florida took the unification threat very seriously, as on 8 April 1937 he was appointed president of jury to examine proposals for AET logotypes, Pensamiento Alaves 08.04.37, available here In mid-April he was one of 4 Carlists summoned to Burgos; general√≠simo informed them about forthcoming political unification.apart from Florida, they were Rodezno, Ul√≠barri and Mart√≠nez Berasain, Pe√±as Bernaldo 1996, p. 270 It is not clear why he was picked up by Franco; some suggest that Florida was among most \\"conspicuous\\" Carlists because of his Requet√© recruitment activities.\\"con cargo preeminente en la direcci√≥n del Requet√©\\", Maximiliano Garc√≠a Venero, Historia de la unificaci√≥n, Madrid 1970, p. 96. This argument does not seem convincing, since the man formally responsible for Requet√©, Jose Luis Zamanillo, was actually ignored by the Franco headquarters. As to Rodezno, it seems that he and his entourage considered unification sort of a loose general alliance; he ensured his fellow partymen that unification means monarchy, regionalism and Catholicism. Some scholars are not sure whether Florida took part in the meeting, Blinkhorn 2008, pp. 288, 360 At that time Franco and his aides were already considering personal composition of executive of the state party just to be announced. Florida was not among the Carlists initially marked; presented by Franco with shortlisted candidates,there were 3 Carlists on the original list of candidates: Conde de Rodezno, Marcelino Ulibarri and Luis Arellano, Pe√±alba Sotorr√≠o 2013, p. 56 Rodezno suggested that Marcelino Ulibarri is dropped and one more seat is reserved for the Carlists, coming with the names of Florida and Jos√© Mar√≠a Maz√≥n.Pe√±alba Sotorr√≠o 2013, p. 56 The proposal was accepted and on 22 April Dolz found himself among 4 Carlists nominated to a 10-membersome scholars say there were 9 members, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 291 \\"Secretariado o Junta Pol√≠tica\\"Boletin Oficial de la Provincia de Sor√≠a 28.04.37, available here of Falange Espa√±ola Tradicionalista.Pe√±alba Sotorr√≠o 2013, p. 53 Of all its members he was perhaps the least-known one; among press-published short notes about the appointees, his was the shortest one.El Progreso 29.04.37, available here Terms of unification greatly disappointed many Carlists, including some of the Junta appointees;following publication of the Unification Decree some Carlists - Rodezno, Arellano, Ortigosa, Berasain - disgusted with its terms, visited Franco to voice their opinion; Florida was not among them, Pe√±alba Sotorr√≠o 2013, p. 54 the regent was furious. In June the Carlist junteros asked him to authorize their presence in the Junta, but to no avail;Manuel Martorell P√©rez, La continuidad ideol√≥gica del carlismo tras la Guerra Civil [PhD thesis in Historia Contemporanea, Universidad Nacional de Educaci√≥n a Distancia], Valencia 2009 , p. 45 later on all were expulsed from Comuni√≥n for breach of loyalty.some scholars claim they were expulsed on July 18, 1937 - Ana Mar√≠n Fidaldo, Manuel M.

Payne, Fascism in Spain, Madison 1999, , especially chapters Francisco Franco and the formation of the Falange Espa√±ola Tradicionalista, pp. 239-272, and The FET during the Civil War, pp. 273-39 Moreover, the Carlists were enraged to find that what they supposed to be an organization they could control or at least influence was increasingly turning into a new version of Falange, with syndicalist blue-shirts systematically gaining the upper hand. Following unification Carlist rank-and-file started to bombard their leaders in Junta and in Consejo with complaints about getting sidetracked, asking for support. As recipient of these notes and phone calls Florida is recorded as pledging support; it is not clear whether he indeed intervened, though it is clear that nothing changed.Jos√© Antonio Parejo Fern√°ndez, Falangistas y requet√©s: historia de una absorci√≥n violenta, [in:] Mar√≠a Encarna Nicol√°s Mar√≠n, Carmen Gonz√°lez Mart√≠nez (eds.), Ayeres en discusi√≥n: temas clave de Historia Contempor√°nea, Madrid 2008, , pp. 12-14, 16 Francoism, 1939 Throughout most of the Civil War in public Florida maintained a loyal Francoist stand.apparently he remained also on very good terms with the military of the Burgos headquarters, as he was in position to issue recommendations regarding handling of foreign vounteers; it was thanks to his support that in August 1937 colonel Antonio Barroso y S√°nchez-Guerra directed a certain Andre Radzivill, referred to as \\"Principe de Estado de Ucraina (Polonia Rusa)\\", to enlist to the 6.

Florida's career at the top of the Francoist political strata came to the end in late summer of 1939. As late as in August he was still reported taking part in public events as consejero nacional,El Progreso 13.07.39, available here but this changed in September; he did not find himself among appointees to the II Consejo Nacional and starting 1940 he was reported in the press simply as \\"Conde de la Florida\\".ABC 12.03.40, available here None of the sources consulted offers any insight into his departure from the party executive, and specifically whether it was a fall from grace or a conscious decision to withdraw. It could have been resignation following disappointment with the syndicalist format of the new party; it could have been marginalization suffered as a result of an internal conflict, as it happened with Joaqu√≠n Bau, another Carlist sidetracked by Ram√≥n Serrano Su√±er,Joaqu√≠n Monserrat Cavaller, Joaqu√≠n Bau Nolla y la restauraci√≥n de la Monarqu√≠a, Madrid 2001, , p. 184 especially that Florida publicly kept declaring inevitable restoration of the monarchy.El Diario Palentino 28.02.38, available here Political retirement and long senility (after 1939) RUMHE logotype No longer in the top political flight, in the early 1940s Florida was still present in public life, e.g. taking part in Traditionalism-flavored feasts attended by some FET heavyweights.El Progreso 12.03.40, available here In 1942 he was not appointed to the III Consejo NacionalABC 24.11.42, available here and his political career seemed definitely over. This might not have been exactly the case, as in 1944 he was reported among governmental officials, namely noted as subsecretario de industria.Imperio 27.02.44, available here This was, however, definitely the last of his Francoist episodes; afterwards he was no longer mentioned related either to the party or to the government. He did not accept an olive branch from Carlism; in 1942 Fal declared that all those stained by Falangism might be re-admitted given they abandon their state party links; the offer explicitly excluded from the scheme some of the leaders, but Florida was not among them.Pe√±alba Sotorr√≠o 2013, p. 143 In the late 1940s he ventured to publicly demonstrate support for Ricardo Oreja, his old-time fellow Mellista, when the latter succeeded in Madrid municipal elections.ABC 22.02.49, available here Juan de Borb√≥n y Battenberg (right), 1959 Though already at the retirement age, Florida remained active in a number of enterprises, mostly related to mineral resources and dependent businesses, like construction or pharmaceuticals; some of them, like RUMHE,RUMHE standing for Riqueza Urbana Madrile√±a Juan de Herrera, Hoja Oficial de Lunes 14.06.43, available here landed hefty contracts in prestigious locations, like the Madrid Gran V√≠a.Hoja Oficial de Lunes 15.05.44, available here In the 1950s he regularly featured in societ√© columns, attending aristocratic feasts related and unrelated to his own family.

Life Badger was born in Kenilworth, Illinois, into a rich and prosperous family. Her summers as a child were spent in Northern Wisconsin. As well as attending Roycemore School in Evanston, from the age of six she attended junior art classes in Winnetka, run by the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC). After graduating from Roycemore she returned to SAIC to complete a degree in studio art in 1925. Her tutors at SAIC included muralist John W. Norton, and Dutch-born Matilda Vanderpoel, sister of John Vanderpoel, famed teacher at the Institute, with whom Badger became close friends. Badger spent several summers painting at Vanderpoel's residence in Gold Hill, Colorado, and the two women went on a study trip together to Europe in 1925. On her return she returned to Roycemore School to teach art, as well as setting up a studio at the Fine Arts Building in Chicago to develop sketches she had created while in Europe. Her family lost their fortune during the Great Depression, and Badger therefore qualified for the Illinois Art Project, run by the Works Progress Administration. In this role she created murals for numerous public buildings, such as libraries and schools, in Chicago, Oak Park and Joliet, many with rural and family themes. She became a fixture on the Chicago art scene, featuring in 17 exhibitions at the Art Institute of Chicago between 1927 and 1943, as well as the Chicago Public Library and many art clubs and galleries in the area. She served as President of the Chicago Society of Artists in 1942, and shared a studio in Tree Studios with Rue Wintherbotham Shaw, President of the Arts Club of Chicago. In the 1940s, Badger returned to the SAIC to teach, alongside her friends Ethel Spears and Kathleen Blackshear. In 1949 she became a student again, graduating from the Art Institute in 1949 with a BFA, and continued painting until a few years before her death. Badger married Paul Schofield in 1940, and they lived in North Shore, Chicago. She died in a nursing home in Northbrook in 1997. She was survived by a son, Shreve Badger Schofield. Art Badger's mural work included Joliet Township High School (1928, 1930), the Audy Home in Chicago, Cook County Children's Hospital, the Hall of Science at the Century of Progress exhibition in 1933 and Stevenson playground in Oak Park. The Oak Park murals are kept today by the Oak Park Historical Society. Badger was not a prolific painter, and for this reason her paintings are not common now, though they can be found at the Illinois State Museum, Springfield, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the John Vanderpoel Collection in Chicago. Her most celebrated work was Celery Pickers, No. 1, exhibited at the 1941 Chicago and Vicinity Exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago. In 1948, a profile in the Chicago Tribune said of Badger that \\"nearly all her work reflects to some degree the passion for nature which she acquired among the pleasant surroundings of her early life and which now, in maturity, is more intense than ever before.\\" References 1904 births 1997 deaths People from Kenilworth, Illinois School of the Art Institute of Chicago alumni Muralists Artists from Chicago ","title":"Frances Badger"},{"id":"52465989","title":"Statements (song)"},{"id":"52465990","text":"Canton is the name of an electoral ward in the west of the city of Cardiff, Wales, which covers its namesake community, Canton. The ward elects three county councillors to the County Council of the City and County of Cardiff. Description and history The Canton ward boundaries are coterminous with the community, bordered to the north by the Pencisely Road, to the west by the River Ely and stretching as far south as Leckwith and the Cardiff City Stadium. It is separated from the Riverside ward to the east by Llandaff Road. According to the 2011 census the population of the ward was 14,304. In recent history Canton has been represented by the Labour Party. Councillors have included future Westminster MP, Kevin Brennan (1991-2001) and future South Glamorgan County Council leader Russell Goodway (1985-1991). Fellow Canton councillor David Thomas became Brennan's election agent during the 2001 General Election and subsequently became the MP's caseworker. As far back as the late 19th-century Canton was a ward to Cardiff Town Council. Cardiff Council elections The Canton ward has elected three Labour councillors at every election to the new Cardiff unitary authority since 1995. At the May 2017 elections Susan Elsmore, Stephen Cunnah and Ramesh Patel were elected. Cllr Patel had been a Canton councillor since a by-election on 1 June 2001. He had been responsible for leisure, culture and sport in Cardiff since 2013. * = sitting councillor prior to the election =2014 by-election= Labour councillor (since 2008) Cerys Furlong resigned in December 2013 because of difficulties balancing her council work with her main job and her family. A by-election took place on 20 February 2014, with the Labour candidate Susan Elsmore coming top of the poll, with Plaid Cymru in second place. Cardiff City Council elections Prior to 1995 Canton was an electoral ward to Cardiff City Council (a district council of South Glamorgan). The ward elected three city councillors. All three city councillors were from the Conservative Party, from 1976 until being replaced by the Labour Party at the 1991 election. South Glamorgan Council elections Prior to 1995 Canton was a ward to South Glamorgan County Council. Two county councillors were elected at the 1973, 1977 and 1981 elections (both Conservatives until 1981). From 1985 the ward elected a single councillor. Labour's Russell Goodway was the representative until the 1991 election (when he became councillor for the Glan Ely ward). Cardiff County Borough Council Canton has been an electoral ward in Cardiff since the 19th-century, to Cardiff Borough Council and (between 1889 and 1974) Cardiff County Borough Council. At the final elections of the county borough on 7 May 1970, Canton's Conservative councillor Trevor Tyrrell successfully held his seat with a 382 majority over the Labour candidate. At the first full elections to Cardiff County Borough Council on 1 November 1889, Canton was one of only two wards to hold a contest. The two sitting Liberal Party councillors retained the seat with a healthy majority, against what the local newspaper described as a \\"so-called Independent\\" candidate. * Ward 'retiring' councillor References Canton, Cardiff Cardiff electoral wards Electoral wards of South Glamorgan ","title":"Canton (Cardiff electoral ward)"},{"id":"52466000","text":"A Wrinkle in Time is a 1962 science fantasy novel by Madeleine L'Engle.

The organism can grow at a broad range of temperatures on seawater media. It has the ability to form biofilms, which increases the organism‚Äôs resistance to antimicrobial agents, such as tetracycline.  Discovery and isolation  Dokdonia donghaensis was discovered and isolated from the Sea of Japan in Korea from an island called Dokdo, a Korean name for the Liancourt Rocks which sovereignty is disputed between Japan and Korea; the date of isolation is not specified. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence of the organism revealed two closely related strains, DSW-1T and DSW-21. These strains are classified in Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides (CFB) group, which are dominant genera in marine environments. Winogradsky first described Cytophaga-like bacteria as unicellular, gliding, non-spore-formers, and Gram-negative rods, although the shape varies. Many Cytophaga-like bacterial colonies have pigment due to flexirubin-type pigments that are only found in these bacteria and flavobacteria. Cytophaga‚ÄìFlavobacteria are chemoorganotrophs and are able to degrade biopolymers like chitin and cellulose.  Morphology and genome  D. donghaensis is a gram-negative bacterium that is rod-shaped, nonmotile, and a non-spore-former. The bacteria are able to grow on seawater media with agar, in which the colonies appear circular, slightly convex, glistening, smooth, yellow, and 1‚Äì2 mm in diameter. The DSW-1T strain of D. donghaensis has about 3,923,666 base pairs in its genome. The DNA G+C content for D. donghaensis is 38%. Image of the phylogenetic tree can be viewed here.  Pathology  D. donghaensis has not been identified as a human pathogen.  Metabolism  D. donghaensis performs light-driven sodium ion transport. This light-driven proton pump is called a proteorhodopsin, which increases the organism‚Äôs survival rate because it can convert light into energy that the organism needs to grow. Since the organism uses light for energy, it is a phototroph. D. donghaensis is able to secrete enzymes such as catalase and oxidase. Since the organism is a strict aerobe, it used oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor. The organism can grow on peptone and tryptone as the sole carbon and nitrogen sources. D. donghaensis cannot grow in the absence of NaCl or when it is greater than 7% (w/v); growth is optimal at 2% (w/v) NaCl. The organism is susceptible to the antibiotics tetracycline and carbenicillin, although the organism's ability to form biofilms makes it difficult for antibiotics to penetrate the viscous layers.  Habitat  D. donghaensis lives in halophilic marine environments. The organism can grow as low as 4 ¬∞C and as high as 35 ¬∞C, although the optimum temperature for growth is 30 ¬∞C. The optimal pH for growth is 7-8, although growth can be observed at a pH as low as 5.5.  Biofilm formation  D. donghaensis is able to form biofilms in marine habitats, which is a survival strategy that allows the organism to grow while being protected from environmental stresses. Biofilm formation serves a purpose for marine bacteria in that it increases their resistance to antimicrobial agents, desiccation, and grazing. Biofilms allow the microbes to attach to surfaces by excreting extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). Marine bacteria that adhere to surfaces form host-specific and spatially structured communities that are fairly stable.

It is also one of four comic books introduced by DC Comics in 2016 as part of the comic book initiative Hanna-Barbera Beyond, among with Scooby Apocalypse, Future Quest and The Flintstones. Premise Official premise by DC Comics: The world has ended, but the race has just begun! Penelope Pitstop, Peter Perfect and the rest of the Wacky Racers vie for the finish line in a contest where the winner takes all and second place is death. Today‚Äôs trial: the shattered maze of freeways known as the √úberpass, where they‚Äôre beset by giant sand beasts, mutated insects, and worst of all, Dick Dastardly‚Äôs murderously poor sportsmanship. The last thing they need after surviving the race is a brutal bar fight in a local dive, but that‚Äôs just what they get!! Characters * Dick Dastardly and Muttley ‚Äì Drivers of the Mean Machine, Dick Dastardly and Muttley are known by the other racers for being the biggest cheaters there are, not to mention the biggest bastards there are. Before the apocalypse, Dastardly was a world-renowned pianist called Richard D'Astardlien, who lost his wife and son due to his cowardice during a nanite attack. As for Muttley, he is a mutated and robotically-enhanced dog whose intelligence and aggressiveness were slightly enhanced thanks to his exposure to the \\"SC-00-B2\\" serum, created in the Butcher Shop as one of the many projects overseen by Professor Pat Pending. * Penelope Pitstop ‚Äì Driver of the Compact Pussycat, Penelope Pitstop is a tough, no-nonsense young girl who takes no orders from anyone and sees herself as a strong and independent woman in a world where the strongest prevail. She has a close bond with her car, stating that they are full-time partners in the race, looking out for one another. Before the apocalypse, Penelope lived in the Greek island of Aegina, with her mother and her sister, who were killed by a tsunami that destroyed the island. * Peter Perfect ‚Äì Driver of the Turbo Terrific, Peter Perfect is seen by the other racers as Earth's last Boy Scout, mostly because of the way he acts, upholding the rules of chivalry. Unlike most of his fellow racers, Peter believes that even though the world has ended, it does not mean one should act and behave like a savage. A natural driver, he is also a bit of a scaredy-cat, trying to make a good impression in front of Penelope, whom he has a soft spot for. * Professor Patrick \\"Pat\\" Pending ‚Äì Driver of the Convert-a-Car, Professor Pat Pending is an erudite and slightly insane scientist who, in the past, was head of the projects and scientific experiments conducted in a private research facility called \\"the Butcher Shop\\". Among those experiments were some of the individuals that would later join the Wacky Race, as well as creations that caused the end of the world. With an insane yet brilliant mind at his disposal, he makes his job keeping the racers alive; for secretly, he needs them to accomplish a goal that he set for himself a long time ago. It is revealed that he subliminally programmed the Announcer to create the Race (and the racers) so that he would have an army to destroy her. * The Ant Hill Mob ‚Äì Drivers of the Bulletproof Bomb, the Ant Hill Mob are a group of gangster-like albino midgets with a hive mind mentality composed of seven members, named I to VII, with V (pronounced Vee) as their leader. Although sharing a hive mind, the seven members of the Ant Hill Mob can think and act for themselves separately. They were part of an experiment conducted by Professor Pat Pending in the Butcher Shop, which manufactured them in a cloning facility in order to be used as cheap manpower for the military. * Lazy Luke and Blubber Bear ‚Äì Drivers of the Arkansas Chug- a-bug, Lazy Luke and Blubber Bear are a duo of hunters who lived up north. Having been friends ever since they were kids, they have always looked out for each other. Luke is an alcoholic who drinks in order to forget the horrors he sees (he carries around a map with the locations of all the bars in the Wasteland), while Blubber is half-human, half-bear as a result of the Announcer's surgery to piece him back together after a grizzly bear attacked the two friends, nearly killing him. * The Red Baron ‚Äì Driver of the Crimson Haybailer, Red is a narcissistic, homophobic sociopath with Nazi tendencies, always referring to his motherland and how Adolf Hitler was right about eradicating certain kinds of people off the face of the planet, while stating that he himself is the living proof of Germany's Master Race. Before he joined the Race, Red was a professional gambler, having ripped off some of the most powerful men and women in Las Vegas. He was also in love with the daughter of Las Vegas' most powerful man, the Colonel, who accidentally killed his daughter when she placed herself in front of a bullet meant for Red. He has a particular hatred for Sergeant Blast. * Rufus Ruffcut and Sawtooth ‚Äì Drivers of the Buzz Wagon, Rufus is a gay lumberjack who believes in the old saying that \\"bigger is better\\". As for Sawtooth, he is a small androgynous street urchin who fancies all kinds of knives and whom Rufus adopted as his prot√©g√©. * Sergeant Blast and Private Meekly ‚Äì Drivers of the Army Surplus Special, Sergeant Blast and Private Meekly are an unstoppable duo, familiarized with all sorts of military tactics and an amazing arsenal at their disposal. Sergeant Blast is a transgender woman and spends her time reminding the others that although she is transgender, that makes her no less worthy than anyone else. As for Private Meekly, he is a weapon enthusiast, who sticks around Sergeant Blast not because he fears her, but because he respects her. * The Gruesome Twosome ‚Äì Drivers of the Creepy Coupe, the Gruesome Twosome are a duo of freaks who resemble monsters, with Little Gruesome resembling a green- skinned vampire and Big Gruesome resembling a Frankenstein monster-type gladiator. Not much is known about them, except for the fact that Little Gruesome is able to control a swarm of bats that do his bidding, while Big Gruesome has incredible strength. * The Slag Brothers ‚Äì Drivers of the Boulder Mobile, the Slag Brothers are a couple of Neanderthals who were brought back to life through the experiments conducted by Professor Pat Pending in the Butcher Shop before escaping it. Although they were frozen in ice for thousands of years, both Rock and Gravel Slag are able to understand English and speak it through the use of caveman expressions, thanks to a series of brain surgeries conducted by Pat Pending. Having lived off the land in the past, the two men are incredible scavengers and hunters. * The Announcer ‚Äì The mysterious host of the Wacky Race. The Announcer turns out to be Professor Pat Pending's wife, Angelique Pending, who lost her body in an accident during the Slag Brothers' rampage through the Butcher Shop. In order to save her, Pat Pending removed her brain and placed it in a special container, which allowed her to live. Unfortunately, the lack of a physical body resulted in her going insane, unleashing an apocalyptic event on Earth, which turned it into a wasteland. Reception Wacky Raceland has had generally favorable reviews, with critics praising the art as well as the story.

It was originally composed of Jacobite political refugees fleeing the violence of Britain's revolutions, particularly the Glorious Revolution of 1688. This community eventually extended to the ports of Bordeaux and La Rochelle as well as to the Colony of Saint-Domingue.  Origins  The refugees were largely aristocrats, no longer able to bear arms or command troops. They threw themselves instead into colonial trade, creating numerous trading companies, among them those leading in the Transatlantic slave trade. They also integrated themselves fully into the city of Nantes, marrying the daughters of the local nobility. In Ireland these refugees in France were known as Wild Geese by their detractors. Nantes was the foremost port for the Irish trading fleet. Out of sixty Jacobite company headquarters and trading houses in Europe in the mid-18th century, two thirds were based in four ports: 12 in Nantes, 9 in Bordeaux, 8 in Cadiz and a dozen in Stockholm and Gothenburg (although these were essentially branch offices). The community also included a large number of priests. Bishop Robert Barry of Cork, Bishop Cornelius O‚ÄôKeefe of Limerick and Bishop Patrick Comerford of Waterford all lived in Nantes. In 1695, the Bishop of Nantes gave them the use of his residence during the summer, the manoir de la Touche, which was to become a seminary for Irish priests, active until the French Revolution. Lastly, there were Irish people of more modest rank or means, who generally took on occupations relating to maritime commerce ‚Äì captains, pilots, coopers and porters. Development of the Community The standing of the Irish in Nantes grew steadily, if we observe the course of events across three generations. The first generation, of Nicolas Luker, Paul Sarsfield, Andr√© Geraldin and Nicolas L√©e, emigrated to France in the middle of the 17th century, after the Irish Rebellion of 1641. They were joined later on by other Irish refugees following the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and the Treaty of Limerick in 1691. This wave of emigres was not confined to Nantes. The historian Gabriel Audisio notes the presence of Irish Catholic soldiers in the armies of the Duke of Savoy and of the Marquis of Pianezza, which took part in the bloody repression of the Waldensians during the Piedmont Easter.http://stephanemantoux.unblog.fr/2008/11/10/ The second generation included Luc O'Shiell, the pirate Phillip Walsh, based in Saint-Malo, and Jean Stapleton, with his associate Jacques Rulidge. They were welcomed with open arms by a country in the midst of the War of the League of Augsburg and Louis XIV welcomed several thousand Irish exiles at the Jacobite court of Saint- Germain-en-Laye. He made the Irish the spearhead of his army, and above all of his navy, particularly during the Jamaica Expedition of 1694. On 8 June 1694, Irish ships formed the bulk of a fleet of 22 vessels and 1,500 men which left Nantes under Admiral Jean-Baptiste du Casse, heading for Jamaica. They burned hundreds of houses and seized 1,300 slaves, whom they took to Saint-Domingue. They did not however attempt to seize the island of Jamaica as they judged this too difficult. The third generation included the wives and daughters of Luc O'Shiell, Antoine Walsh, Jean Stapleton Junior and Jean-Baptiste MacNemara. They had considerable fortunes, which they invested in property while plotting to overthrow the British government. The Irish expatriate community was also notable at Bordeaux, where, from 1715, it developed an important trade in salted beef with Ireland, which was used in supplying merchant fleets and overseas colonies. Significant Figures * Nicolas L√©e was the first to settle in Nantes in 1649 * Paul Sarsfield settled in France in 1658 and Louis XIV granted him French nationality in 1678. His son Patrick Sarsfield served in the king's army 1671‚Äì1678 and again 1691‚Äì1693, commanding the Irish Brigade after the Treaty of Limerick. * Jean Stapleton Senior founded a dynasty of Nantais shipowners. He owned plantations in Saint- Domingue as well as running a business in the Atlantic slave trade. * Antoine Walsh, the most important trader in 18th century Nantes, founder of the Angola Company in 1748. * The Butler family of shipowners, whose name was gallicised as 'Bouteiller', were major importers in Nantes * Agn√®s O'Shiell, daughter of Luc O'Shiell one of the richest traders in Nantes, who were also property owners in Saint-Domingue * Anne O'Shiell, manager of one of the biggest slave trading firms in the Nantes slave trade * At La Rochelle, Denis Mac Carthy was an important trader * Victor Martin O'Gorman was elected d√©put√© from Saint- Domingue.

Origins The stadium was originally called the Moorfield Stadium and was built in 1933 on the west side of Sunderland Road north of Easington in a rural location. The racing provided entertainment for a population centered around mining and the nearby Easington Colliery. History The opening meeting was held on Christmas Day 1934, with the first winner being a greyhound called 'Must Win' who recorded a winning time of 27.07secs. During the war, Lord Haw-Haw famously said, \\"This week the people of Easington will be eating greyhounds not racing them\\". During the 1960s and 1970s, racing was directed by Mrs H Taylor and distances raced were 270, 460, 525 and 640 yards on 380 track circumference. There were 70 kennels and a Ball hare system was used. Facilities included a licensed bar and tea bar with racing held on Thursday and Saturday evenings at 7.30pm. All races were handicap races with the principal annual events known as the Moorfield Challenge Trophy and the Bank Holiday Stakes. By the late 1980s the owner was Frank Fannon and there was car parking for 200 vehicles. Racing took place on Sundays at 6pm. Race distances of 60, 235, 410 and 573 metres were used.

Biography Erichsen's father was a confectioner and died while Erichsen was still very young.Brief biography @ the Norsk Biografisk Leksikon. Although he originally wanted to be pianist, he began as a law student in 1886, then interrupted his studies to attend the painting school operated by Knud Bergslien, where he took the arts and crafts course. Later, he moved to Copenhagen, where he became a student of Kristian Zahrtmann, who had a more profound influence on his artistic development.Brief Biography @ the Norsk Kunstnerleksikon, Interior with Oluf Wold-Torne He also travelled to Italy and Paris, where he met with Pierre Bonnard and absorbed the influences of late Impressionism.Brief Biography @ the Store Norske Leksikon. His d√©but came in 1891 with the painting \\"Spring Mood\\". He would continue to travel extensively throughout his life and never settled in one place. In 1900, his style made a dramatic change, from a Naturalistic approach to an emphasis on color and shape becoming, together with his friend, Oluf Wold-Torne, one of the pioneers of Modern Norwegian painting. His most notable works from this period are several nudes and landscapes from the vicinity of Telemark. In 1907, his brother , a member of the Storting, obtained a major commission for him, but it was never completed. From 1907 to 1910, he lived in Vestre Gausdal and focused on bluish winter landscapes. During his last year there, he was invited to enter a competition for decorating the main hall at the University of Oslo, but declined. In 1915, Erichsen appears to have suffered from a nervous breakdown, precipitated by a troubled relationship with the composer, Reidar Br√∏gger (1886-1956). After recovering, he worked in a quieter style, doing most of his work during summers in Holmsbu. His later works focus on the countryside around Lillehammer, where he lived for extended periods. He also created numerous still lifes, framed by the window of his hotel room, and often went for long periods without painting. Although he lived in isolation, his paintings were popular and were sold throughout Europe. In 1930, he was awarded an annual stipend for artists (the Statens Kunstnerl√∏nn). He died of leukemia in 1939.

It is located between Brooklyn Avenue to the west and Kingston Avenue to the east, and between St. Marks Avenue to the north and Park Place to the south. The T-shaped park encompasses roughly and shares a square block with the Brooklyn Children's Museum and P.S. 289 George V Brower.  History The park, like the elementary school which occupies the same block, was named after George Vanderhoof Brower (c. 1839-1921), the Commissioner of Parks for the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens from 1889 to 1894 and from 1898 to 1901. Previously known as Bedford Park, the park was renamed after Brower in 1921. After serving as an apprentice to a Pennsylvania judge, George Brower moved to Brooklyn in 1867 to practice law. He served as general appraiser of the Port of New York for four years before being appointed as Commissioner of Parks. Brower died in his home, at 1084 Park Place directly southeast of the park, in 1921. The City of Brooklyn purchased what is now the southern portion of the park in 1892. A comfort station was erected in the park 1905, and a World War I memorial was dedicated there in 1919. The park was altered in 1936 by the addition of drinking fountains, benches, and a playground. A park improvement scheme in 1939 provided the park with a new grass lawn planted by boy scouts. These improvements were completed in 1941. Additional parkland was purchased in 1947. The George V. Brower School (P.S. 289) opened in 1958, and Prospect Place was closed between Brooklyn and Kingston Avenues, bringing together the northern and southern portions of the park. In the 1950s, a new playground and handball courts were constructed. A monarch butterfly garden was built in 2014 with the help of the Friends of Brower Park. The Shirley Chisholm Circle was dedicated in 2016. The paved, circular terrace along Kingston Avenue was named after Shirley Anita St. Hill Chisholm (1924‚Äì2005), an American politician, educator, and author who, in 1968, became the first African American woman elected to the United States Congress. Chisholm represented New York's 12th Congressional District for seven terms from 1969 to 1983. Facilities Brower Park has basketball courts, bathrooms, fitness paths, handball courts, a playground, a skate park, and spray showers. = Brower Park Skate Park = The Brower Park skate park opened September 10, 2011, the second concrete skatepark in Brooklyn. Eric Adams, who was State Senator at the time, approved the skate park. An organization lead by Traci and Jay Johnson rallied for the park to be built. The park consists of handful of boxes/ledges, and a small ramp.

It was the twenty-second Mickey Mouse short to be produced, the seventh of that year. The short is a spoof of the 1925 play The Gorilla by Ralph Spence, which had been made into a 1927 silent film and a sound remake.  Synopsis  Mickey Mouse reads in the newspaper that a gorilla has escaped from the zoo, and he calls Minnie to warn her. She's not afraid, and sings a song to Mickey over the phone. Then the gorilla breaks into her house and kidnaps her, and Mickey -- hearing her screams over the telephone -- rushes to save her. The gorilla takes Minnie upstairs to the attic and ties her up, then plays cat and mouse with Mickey. At the end, the gorilla trips over the rope, knocking him senseless. Mickey and Minnie dance to celebrate their narrow escape. Production While the gorilla in the short isn't named, it was retroactively identified as the same gorilla seen in the 1933 shorts Mickey's Mechanical Man and The Pet Store, named Beppo. The 1944 short Donald Duck and the Gorilla has a similar plot to this film, with a killer gorilla named Ajax escaping from the local zoo. Reception In Mickey's Movies: The Theatrical Films of Mickey Mouse, Gijs Grob observes, \\"The Gorilla Mystery is noteworthy for the extensive dialogue in the beginning. By now the Disney animators had mastered lip-sync, and neither Mickey nor Minnie show any awkward faces while talking. Even more interesting is the cartoon's elaborately drawn gorilla, which in several scenes is staged to show its huge size. The gorilla and the clever use of light and shadow make The Gorilla Mystery look more sophisticated than earlier Mickey Mouse cartoons. Even The Fire Fighters of only three months earlier starts to look primitive.\\" Motion Picture News (Dec 6, 1930): \\"This is not up to the standard of other Mickey Mouse cartoons, but it is a good comedy, nevertheless. The telephone sequence is especially good.\\" Voice cast * Mickey Mouse: Walt Disney * Minnie Mouse: Marcellite Garner * Gorilla: unknown See also *Mickey Mouse (film series) References  External links  * The Gorilla Mystery at Internet Movie Database * The Gorilla Mystery at the Big Cartoon DataBase English-language films Disney animated short films, 1930s American films Mickey Mouse short films 1930 short films 1930 animated films 1930 films Films directed by Burt Gillett Films produced by Walt Disney American black-and-white films Films about apes Disney animated film stubs American animated short films Columbia Pictures short films Columbia Pictures animated short films ","title":"The Gorilla Mystery"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:T},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:P}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},R={class:"card-container"};function I(s,e,o,c,u,t){const m=g("PoemCard");return i(),n(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your bitcoinü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",R,[(i(!0),n(h,null,b(t.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(i(),y(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),t.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>t.loadMore&&t.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const H=d(B,[["render",I]]),F=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/9.md","filePath":"quotesmag/9.md"}'),L={name:"quotesmag/9.md"},x=Object.assign(L,{setup(s){return(e,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{F as __pageData,x as default};
