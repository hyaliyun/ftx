The firm's activity under the OFT was too small to cause any headlines, and hence didn't get direct criticism like much more active companies, such as Wonga. The current activity of the company is allied to the strict regulations of the FCA.

Premise Unai, the photographer's son, tells the 15-month journey around the world that Andoni Canela did with his entire family in search of seven threatened animals on all continents. More than a year living with African elephants, American bisons, great hornbills, gentoo penguins, saltwater crocodiles, Iberian wolves and cougars in their natural habitat is a call for contemplation and also for the conservation of these creatures in the wild. Canela chose animals that have traditionally maintained a tense relationship with humans, in some cases being on the verge of extinction, and living in a habitat of high ecological value (the Namib desert, North American prairies, jungles Southeast Asia, Antarctica, mangroves and tropical forests of northern Australia, the Cantabrian Mountains and the steppes of Patagonia) to communicate a conservation message. The fact that the narrative voice of the documentary falls on a 10-year-old boy gives a different point of view to the documentary, making it a suitable piece for all audiences and of an educational value recognized by the critics. The film was presented in three versions: Spanish, Catalan and English, all narrated by Unai. Release Looking for the Wild was premiered on September 1, 2016 at the Cineteca Matadero in Madrid. On September 14, 2016, the Catalan version was released at the Cine Phenomena in Barcelona. Subsequently, it was exhibited in the cinemas of several Spanish cities (Sevilla, October 8, Valencia October 15, Oviedo November 9, Tudela November 10, Pamplona, November 11, Mah√≥n, Ciutadella November 12, Bilbao, San Sebasti√°n and Vitoria November 15). It was broadcast for the first time on television on October 11, 2016, in the program Sense Ficci√≥ de TV3, Televisi√≥n de Catalunya, October 15. In November 2016, the film was selected as a candidate for the Goya Awards and the Gaudi Awards. Reception The press has highlighted the conservationist and educational message of Looking for the Wild. In that sense, it has been said that: \\"Unai's voice invites to sensibility, Meritxell's words prove that the wild world is not at odds with the security of a family and the impeccable photograph of Andoni paints a pristine and natural canvas. But the message is blunt: \\"We are in the midst of extinction. (...) And although Andoni was not the first to witness the debacle and denounce it, perhaps Unai can remove the consciences of stone. (...). Because there is nothing more honest and incorruptible than the look of a child on the world that are annihilating adults.\\" M√≥nica Zas Marcos in eldiario.es (03/09/16).

Early life George Kidd was born in Dundee, Scotland, one of three brothers. He spent his childhood in the Hilltown area and attended Clepington Primary and Stobswell Secondary School. Kidd later left an apprenticeship to join the Royal Navy‚Äôs Fleet Air Arm in 1943 and served as a mechanic during World War II. Professional wrestling career In 1946, after leaving the army, Kidd started to work as a professional wrestler. At only 5' 6\\", weighing in at less than , Kidd had the odds stacked against him. Yet he was able to enjoy great success during his career by developing an elaborate, clever, and sometimes whimsical so-called ‚ÄùBritish‚Äù style of wrestling. Kidd‚Äôs first paid match took place in 1946 at the Caird Hall in Dundee, where he was ‚Äúbooked‚Äù (professional wrestling term for being hired for one match) by promoter George de Relwsykow. In only a four-year span, he went on to conquer numerous championship titles, making a name for himself internationally. In May 1947, Kidd defeated Tony Lawrence in the capital city of Edinburgh, and became the Scottish Lightweight champion. In 1948, Kidd won the British Lightweight Title, defeating Jack Dempsey. He surrendered it to Alan Colbeck in 1949. In 1949, Kidd added the European Lightweight title to his record competing in Paris. In 1950, Kidd won a tournament for the Mountevans Rules World Lightweight title. Shortly thereafter, he travelled to Mexico and defeated Rudi Quarez for the NWA World Lightweight title and brought the unified title back to the UK.Wrestling (Sportsviewers Guide) by Peter Bills, Mick McManus (). In 1951, Kidd briefly lost and regained his titles from and to French wrestler Ren√© Ben Chemoul, adding Chemoul's FFCP World Lightweight Title to the crown. By 1952 he had also defeated Spanish and Belgian claimants to become undisputed World Lightweight championTVTimes interview with George Kidd 1977. (inasmuch as Kidd's was the only active version worldwide of the title). He held onto the combined title for 24 consecutive years, defending it 49 times. His title would remain undisputed until the creation of the UWA World Lightweight Championship in 1975. Kidd was admired for his ability to counter or escape from the most intricate holds, earning himself the nickname of ‚Äúthe Houdini of the mat‚Äù. Kidd was also a devout practitioner of Hatha Yoga, which helped him develop flexibility and mental sharpness instead of focusing only on muscle bulk, which in turn helped him defeat stronger and heavier opponents. Kidd was also a showman who knew how to focus on his in-ring skills instead of gimmicks to entertain a crowd. His technical savvy coupled with a fierce competitive spirit allowed him to out-wrestle some of the most praised names in the professional wrestling business. In 1976, after more than 1000 matches, suffering only 7 defeats, Kidd resigned his championship and retired. During his lengthy career, Kidd rarely wrestled on television (although he often appeared on it as a broadcaster), because he believed that over-exposure would turn the sport he loved into a pantomime. He also trained or influenced many other accomplished pro wrestlers who would later go on to become major stars on British television‚Äôs World of Sport era, including long-lasting lightweight champion Johnny Saint. In 2015, George Kidd became the first entrant into the Scottish wrestling‚Äôs hall of fame created by wrestling historian Bradley Craig. He was inducted by former wrestler turned Aberdeen councillor Len Ironside during Hell for Lycra XII, a Scottish Wrestling Entertainment event in Caird Hall. A memorial plaque honoring him was also hung in the venue. Broadcasting career Kidd also worked for Grampian Television, which started transmitting in his hometown city of Dundee in 1961. He hosted Wednesday People and The George Kidd Show. In 1965, viewers voted him Grampian Television Personality of the Year. Personal life On 8 June 1949, George married his wife Hester MacLachlan in Dundee. Kidd owned a series of pubs in his hometown, including the Ellenbank Bar in Alexander Street. In 1965 Kidd he was awarded the Dundee‚Äôs ‚Äò‚ÄôFirst Citizen‚Äô‚Äô title. George Kidd died on 5 January 1998. He had moved to Lawrence Street in the Broughty Ferry suburb of Dundee.

Designed by architects John and Benjamin Green, it was originally built in the late 1830s for the Newcastle & North Shields Railway. It is a Grade II listed building. The viaduct is 1,048 feet (319m) long and 76 feet (23m) high with 7 segmental arches each of 120 feet (36.5m) span. When originally built the viaducts were made of laminated timber construction on the Wiebeking system supported on tall stone pillars and cost ¬£25,000. Each arch was made from 14 layers of 22\\" x 3-1/2\\" timbers held together by trenails and built by Messrs. Robson. A paper on the viaducts's design won Benjamin Green a silver Telford Medal from the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1841. The viaduct was rebuilt in iron between 1867 and 1869 by the Weardale Iron & Coal Company to the designs of engineer Thomas Elliot Harrison, preserving the bridge's original shape and form. It now carries the Tyne and Wear Metro rapid transport system between Newcastle and North Shields.

Pinegrove, formed in Montclair, New Jersey two years earlier, spent its early years self-recording its music at home. Meridian offers eight songs, including fan favorite \\"Recycling\\", that showcase its mix of alternative country and emo. All of its contents were composed by the band's frontman, singer-songwriter Evan Stephens Hall. He and drummer Zack Levine founded the group. Meridian also features contributions from occasional band members Nick Levine, Aidan Feliciano, and Nandi Rose Plunkett. The album received positive responses from the small following the band had developed. The LP was later repurposed into the band's 2014 compilation Everything So Far, which serves as an anthology of the group's early work. Background Pinegrove was formed in 2010 in Montclair, New Jersey by singer-songwriter Evan Stephens Hall and drummer Zack Levine. The group spent its early years performing DIY concerts in basements while self-booking small tours, and uploading its music to online platform Bandcamp. \\"In those days we'd finish up a project & put it up on bandcamp that night,\\" Hall said later. Its first release, Mixtape One, was released in January 2010. Most of the material present on Meridian was, like all early material, recorded at home in Montclair. The album contains two fan favorites, \\"The Metronome\\" and \\"Recycling\\", both of which remain staples of the band's live setlist while most others have since been retired. K.C. Libman, writing for the Phoenix New Times, calls it an album \\"full of bleating pleas over lush and intricate instrumentals.\\" The group issued a pre-release single, \\"Over My Shoulder\\", on November 27, 2011. Composition Meridian has been categorized as a math rock album. \\"There are definitely elements of rock, R&B;, and maybe sometimes math,\\" Hall confirmed, but suggested that post-country was a better signifier: \\"I think post-country is exactly the type of music we are trying to make [...] I mainly think I try to write American music. Music that feels like it‚Äôs from somewhere.\\" In a Reddit AMA, Hall described \\"The Metronome\\" as \\"about liking someone unrequitedly who is also friends with all of your friends.\\" \\"Mather Knoll\\" refers to a hillock outside Mather Hall, a dormitory at Kenyon College in Ohio, which Hall attended. \\"Recycling\\" takes it name from a recycling plant Hall worked at through college. \\"Morningtime\\" references the proverbial \\"pine grove\\", a grid of pine trees located on a nature reserve at Kenyon. Reception The group uploaded a teaser video to YouTube promoting its impending release on February 15, 2012; it was produced by animator David Masnato and the band. The album debuted on Bandcamp on February 29, 2012, and pressed very limited copies of the album on cassette to sell at shows. \\"I like cassette as a format because it forces the listener, from sheer inconvenience, to listen to the whole thing, because it‚Äôs really such a pain to skip around. So it emphasizes the album format, which I appreciate,\\" Hall said later. In 2014, the group compiled a cassette anthology of early material, Everything So Far, which includes Meridian within its track listing. Everything So Far was issued on vinyl and CD in April 2017, marking the first wide physical release of Meridian. The group were largely unknown at the time of its release, and few reviews were published. Spin contributor Rachel Brodsky later wrote that the LP was received \\"breathlessly in their microcosm of listeners.\\" One of its only reviews was on fansite Maimed and Tamed, and a user-submitted review to the website Sputnikmusic, linked to in the aforementioned Spin piece.

The film features Samuthirakani, Ramya Pandian, Kavin, and Monica in the lead roles, while Radha Ravi, Ilavarasu, Kaali Venkat, Abhishek Vinod, Hareesh Peradi, and Suja Varunee play pivotal and supporting roles. The film features music composed by Ghibran, cinematography by Vijay Milton, and editing by Kasi Viswanathan. The venture began production in September 2017 and released on 12 October 2018 to average reviews from critics. Plot Elango (Samuthirakani) falls in love with Jessy (Ramya Pandian), and both get married. Elango is employed as a medical sales representative, and both of them have no parents/relatives. Jessy also secures a software job and life runs smoothly. They are gifted with twins ‚Äì Agaran (Kavin) and Aathira (Monica). Jessy is more career-oriented, aspiring to achieve greater heights. Elango, on the other hand, thinks family is the at- most preference and feels that they are unable to spend quality time with their children. As Jessy earns more than Elango, the latter decides to quit his job and stay at home taking care of their children and household activities. Jessy is against this decision as she dreams of leading a luxurious life if both could earn. Jessy is impressed seeing her colleague Belita (Suja Varunee), who leads a lavish lifestyle owning a villa and a BMW car. Much against Elango‚Äôs advice, Jessy books an apartment which is under construction. She also buys a BMW car despite Elango warning her about the problems associated with increased bank loans and EMI. Roy (Abhishek Vinod) is Jessy‚Äôs boss who has an eye on her. Arguments arise frequently between Elango and Jessy, which leads to Elango leaving the house as Jessy keeps insulting him for being a stay-at-home father. Aathira also goes out with Elango, while Agaran stays with Jessy. Elango finds shelter with the help of Bullet Thatha (Radha Ravi), a kindhearted man who meets Agaran once in a while. To Jessy's shock, Belita commits suicide as she felt humiliated by a few goons who were employed by the bank to recover her unpaid loans. Jessy realizes the problems associated with too much bank loans. Roy tries to enter into a physical relationship with Jessy for which she does not cooperate, leading him to fire her as a means of revenge. Jessy is devastated as she has lost her job and could not pay her EMIs. Goons arrive at Jessy‚Äôs home to recover loans. Knowing this, Elango arrives and requests the goons to give him some time, so that they can repay the loans. Jessy realizes her mistake leading to her transformation and understands Elango. They both patch up and Elango starts going to a job again, thereby starting to lead a humble but joyful life.

This species, isolated from an alkaline pH 9.5 soil with high concentrations of Mg, Ca and Mn salts, achieves good symbiosis with the majority of agricultural plants, including those under intensive agricultural conditions. It produces abundant extramatrical mycelium that can explore large volumes of soil, reproduces through spores generated inside the root, facilitates good transport of nutrients within the roots of the plant and tolerates high concentrations of nutritional salts in the soil, exhibiting good tolerance to the fertilisation protocols of intensive agriculture. Because of its biological properties, Symborg, the discovering company of this species, has obtained a patent on it, the first that protects a species of AMF. Scientific studies have been performed and published in specialised journals about the effects of this species on various types of crops. In the specific case of table grapes, repeated increases of 12-45% of total production have been achieved over more than three years for the varieties Red Globe, Crimson, Napole√≥n, Thomson seedless, etc., with sustained improvements in fruit quality. Increases in the length and weight of the bunches, greater colour uniformity and higher degrees Brix of the harvested fruit have been found. In horticultural crops, it promotes significant increases in physiological activity (better water status and gas exchange) and productivity (10-15%) of the treated plants, whether cultivated in a greenhouse or in the open field. A study of the root system of the melon, performed by the Polytechnic University of Cartagena in Spain, showed that the application of this fungal species not only increased the root exploration surface after stimulation of fine rootlets but also induced a change in root architecture, encouraging higher nutrient absorption. There were significant increases in potential productivity In greenhouse-grown peppers, studies showed not only an increase in production (1 kg per m2) but also a significant control of plant endogenous hormone expression. At the start of cultivation there was an increase in auxin (indoleacetic acid) expression for greater production of roots and mycorrhizal colonisation, higher expression of gibberellins and cytokines resulting in more leaf development and production after 50 days of growth and a significant reduction of abscisic acid favouring more youthful plants toward the end of the cycle. In cereal and grain production such as corn and soybeans, colonisation with this species enables production increases of over 10%.

It used the signals broadcast by the British Chain Home system as its transmitter, and a series of six stations along the western coast of continental Europe as passive receivers. In modern terminology, the system was a bistatic radar. Because the system sent no signals of its own, the allies were unaware of its presence, and did not learn of the system until well after the D-Day invasion.Pritchard (p.124), however, claims the British were aware of it and tried countermeasures unsuccessfully. The system is referred to as Klein Heidelberg Parasit (Small Heidelberg Parasite) in some references.One German internet article uses another name, das \\"Heidelberg\\"-Ger√§t, literally the Heidelberg equipment. The article also mentions it was used to track bombers from their bases in Britain. History Chain Home's (CH) large antennas could be seen from the French coast, which meant the Germans were aware of their precise location. Their fixed-direction broadcasts towards the continent meant it was easy to determine which signal was broadcast by which station. This was aided by the way the stations spread out their broadcasts in a series of time slots, known as \\"running rabbits\\", which allowed a signal pulse to be traced back to a particular station through its timing. Beginning in 1942, Dr. W√§chter of Telefunken, working with radio engineers at the Reichspost, used this information to build a passive radar system using the CH broadcasts and their own receivers. This was not unlike the Daventry experiment setup that had first been used to demonstrate the radar concept in the UK in early 1935. In both cases, broadcasts from a distant station were used as a signal, and when an aircraft flew into the signal it reflected some of it to the receiver, creating a distinct \\"blip\\" on the display. To this basic concept, W√§chter added the ability to measure the rough azimuth of the target by turning the entire antenna and looking for the maximum signal. CH's relatively long wavelength, around 6 m, demanded very large receiver antennas and fairly complex antenna systems to support this rotation. Another side-effect of the long wavelength was that the angular resolution was relatively low, and although a lobe switching system was considered, it was apparently never used in service. Several test systems were trialled at Cherbourg in 1942 and 1943. The first operational KH system was built at the Nachtfalter (Moth) jamming station at Mont de Couple between Boulogne and Calais, across the English Channel from Dover, which became operational near the end of 1943. A second station at Oostvoorne in the Netherlands (Biber) followed in the spring of 1944. Four more stations were completed in 1944, Vaudricourt (Skorpion), Oostende (Bremse), Cap d'Antifer (Auerhahn) and Cherbourg (Tausendf√ºssler). These were built on Wassermann radar antennas, and sometimes used the Wassermann's own signals for height- finding duties. Description The system used two antennas, a very large one on a rotating platform that was used to receive the signal reflected off the aircraft, and a much smaller one positioned about away that received the signal directly from the CH station. The signals from both antennas were sent to two CRTs taken from the W√ºrzburg radar, which, in typical German fashion, were used in J-scope fashion. This means distances are measured as the angle around the face of the tube, rather than the linear distance across it. A graduated scale around the outside of the CRT was used to measure the angles of the various \\"blips\\" in mils (0 to 400). The operator would first select a single CH station by changing a timer so it picked up only the signals from that station. CH stations broadcast in time slots, one after the other, so it was easy to select a single station using a simple timer. The signal from the smaller antenna was sent to the left display. Using a hand wheel, the operator adjusted a delay circuit until the main blip of the directly received signal was at the 12 o'clock position on this display. The right-hand CRT showed the signal received on the larger antenna. As the direct signal from the CH station was very powerful, it appeared on this display no matter what direction the antenna pointed. The display was set so that it showed only of the second time slot, that is, 2 milliseconds. The operator would then further fine-tune the timing so the direct signal was at the 12 o'clock position on this display as well. When an aircraft flew in front of the larger antenna, some of the CH signal would reflect off it and into the receiver. Since the aircraft was not on the direct line between the two stations, the total distance travelled by the signal to the aircraft and then to the antenna will always be longer than the direct signal. This means a second blip appears on the second display, some time after the direct signal. Measuring the angle around the face of the display revealed the difference in the signal's time of arrival compared to that of the direct signal, as an elapsed time. For any given elapsed time difference, there is an infinite number of locations that match that delay. When plotted, these points form an ellipse with the CH station at one foci and the KH receiver at the other. Today, this is known as the bistatic range. To aid plotting these locations, each set of ten numbers on the circular scale, say 100 to 110, was assigned to a pre-calculated ellipse, in this case \\"ellipse 10\\". The operators would then select that ellipse on a set of provided charts. To measure the angle to the target, the larger antenna was rotated around its vertical axis until the selected target blip was maximized, or alternately disappeared, or \\"nulled\\". The angle could then be read off a graduated scale that was mechanically linked to the antenna's rotation. The charts showed the ellipse and the location of the KH station; a line was drawn outward from the station's location at the measured angle, where it would eventually intersect the ellipse, locating the aircraft. The 2 ms time slot corresponded to a range of , but the system was capable of receiving signals on high-flying aircraft at even longer ranges. In these cases, the operator could use the timer controls to further delay the sweep on the second CRT so that it showed later times, adding that extra fixed delay back to the measured angle when looking up the correct ellipse on the charts. This allowed them to continue tracking as the aircraft flew over Germany. Estimates vary as to the effectiveness of the system. Pritchard gives a range accuracy of 1 to 2 km with a bearing accuracy of 1 degree at range, while Price suggests at . Given the lack of lobe switching, the angle accuracy was more on the order of 10 degrees (+ or -5 degrees).

It is an unofficial remake of the Thai horror comedy blockbuster film Pee Mak. The film features Santhosh Prathap and Reshmi Menon in the leading roles, with Kovai Sarala, Rajendran, Bharani, Jagan, and Lollu Sabha Jeeva in supporting roles. The music was composed by C. Sathya with editing done by Mahendran. The film began production and was completed by late 2015, but delays meant that it had a theatrical release on 22 September 2017. Plot Jai (Santhosh Prathap)leaves behind his pregnant wife Lekha (Reshmi Menon) at a town, in search of her parents in Sri Lanka. He was wounded during an Attack when he tried to save fellow Tamil people, Raj (Bharani), Ajith (Rajendran), Mani (Jagan), and Shiva (Lollu Sabha Jeeva), who later became his best friends after he had saved them from a certain death. Meanwhile, at home, Lekha struggled alone painfully to give birth to a baby; she calls out for help but is too weak to be heard. Shortly after, rumors started circulating the village that Lekha had died in labor and was now a ghost of a very powerful form haunting the house. The villagers in the neighborhood then heard her singing lullabies to her baby, terrifying them and forcing them to cower in fear. When Jai and his friends arrive back to the town in the evening, they find the town completely silent. The five soon arrives at Jai and Lekha's house during the night, and Jai introduces Lekha to them. As it is now too dark to continue traveling, Jai's friends decide to stay. The following day, the men visit the village market but are shunned by the fearful community. A drunk villager attempts to shout out a warning to Jai but is forced down and hushed by her son. Jai's friends then discuss what they had heard but dismiss the rumors as ridiculous. Ajith, however, while he was sent to fetch Jai, saw that the house was a dilapidated wreck that had not been maintained for months, that the baby cot that Jai and Lekha's son was supposed to be sleeping in, was rocking by itself, and then he saw Lekha extending her arm to an unnatural length to retrieve a dropped Apple under the house. The following day, Mani discovers a decomposed corpse behind the house wearing exactly the same ring as Lekha. The drunk villager who had also tried to warn them earlier also turned up mysteriously drowned. Soon, all four friends are convinced that she is a ghost. The friends then try numerous methods to convince Jai of the news, including a game of charades, and come within inches of being murdered by Lekha, with only Jai's presence preventing her from doing so, and she scares them away. Worse, Jai dismisses all of their warnings, proclaims that they are no longer his friends, and kicks them out of their accommodations. Later, Jai and Lekha go out on a date in the town, visiting an amusement park. Jai‚Äôs friends attempt to separate the two by kidnapping Jai, but their plans are foiled when Lekha discovers them and chases them away. Suddenly, during the getaway, Jai's wound reopens. His friends express surprise at how much blood has spilled, but Ajith and Mani become convinced that he, not Lekha, is the ghost, and their fears are seemingly confirmed when Jai reacts in pain when they attack him with holy rice. The friends then flee from their wounded friend and rescue Lekha. While escaping in a boat, Jai \\"returns\\" to them, walking into the river to them, but ends up almost drowning when he suffers cramps. As ghosts are not supposed to feel cramps, Jai is revealed to not have been a ghost, and he is rescued; when asked why he screamed when hit by the holy rice, he reveals that the rice had riddled his wound, making him yell out in pain. In the following confusion, Raj drops a ring identical to the one Jai, Lekha, and the body behind the house had been wearing. Raj is immediately pronounced a ghost and kicked off the boat. The others then try to escape, but, as they had lost the paddles to the boat earlier, they cannot move. Lekha then somehow produces a soaking wet paddle and hands it to Mani, who suddenly recalls that all of them had been thrown overboard, and had already drifted too far away for a normal person to recover. Mani then stands up on the boat to look between his legs at the group; Lekha is revealed to have been the ghost all along, and the four remaining men, including Jai, retreat to a temple. There, the men come under the protection of the local monk, armed with holy rice, holy water, and the temple is fortified with an enchanted \\"safety ring\\". Lekha quickly appears, in her terrifying ghostly form, and attacks. Initially, the holy \\"weapons\\" successfully keep Lekha at bay, but, in a panic, coupled with Jai's struggle to get back to his wife, all of the holy rice and water are wasted, and the monk was accidentally kicked out of the \\"safety ring\\". The monk then fled the temple, leaving the four, who had since destroyed the \\"safety ring\\" while trying to run, to face the angry Lekha. A pale Raj then reappears, and it was revealed that he is also human; he was in possession of the ring because he had stolen it off of the corpse behind the house to finance his gambling. Lekha angrily shouted at the five that she just wanted to be with her loved one, which the four friends argued against since they did not believe the living can be with the dead, and accuse her of killing the drunk; Lekha furiously denies her involvement and says that the drunk had drowned himself. Lekha, in a combination of sadness, anger, and desperation, then threatens to kill Jai and take him to live with her but stops when she sees how much she had been scaring her husband. Jai then revealed that he knew the truth about Lekha all along, having had his suspicions raised during the game of charades. He had already looked at Lekha between his legs, which revealed her ghostly form, and found her decomposed corpse. However, even then, he is far more afraid of living without her than of her being dead. The two tearfully reconcile. His friends, seeing them reuniting, also tearfully reaffirm their friendship, and vow to never leave each other again. A flashback to Jai and Lekha's first meeting is shown. In the credit scenes, Jai, Lekha, and his four friends live happily in the village. Lekha uses her supernatural abilities to do chores, play charades (and helping Mak win for the first time), scare off villagers who are attempting to drive her away (who are led by the village drunk's son), and even run the town's \\"haunted house\\" attraction. It is also revealed that her child also possesses some of her abilities, even though he is still an infant.

Publishers, 2005: 'in her second year... her prodigious musical ability had gained recognition from her professors and peers alike' Hirzel and White Rose In late 1942, while a music student, she again met Sophie Scholl, who called for resistance. At the end of January, at the request of her teenage brother Hans she distributed envelopes containing the fifth \\"White Rose\\" leaflet in mailboxes in Stuttgart. This secret operation was prepared together with Hans' classmate Franz Josef M√ºller in Ulm Martin Luther Church behind the organ. Her father Ernst Hirzel was then pastor at this parish.

It is India's longest road tunnel with a length of , and the country's first tunnel with a fully integrated tunnel control system. It reduces the distance between Jammu and Srinagar by 30 km and travel time by two hours. The all-weather tunnel bypasses snowfall and avalanche prone areas in winter at places like Patnitop, Kud, and Batote that obstruct NH 44 every winter and cause long queues of vehicles ‚Äì sometimes for days on end. It is named after Syama Prasad Mookerjee. Location The tunnel is located on the lower Himalayan range at an altitude of . The southern portal (end) of the tunnel is at and the northern portal (end) of the tunnel is at coordinates . The tunnel has been excavated starting from about from Chenani town south of Patnitop to Nashri village north of Patnitop.  Construction  The foundation was laid for the project in July 2011 by the then Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah with Union Health Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, under the ruling UPA government. The original estimate to build this two-lane tunnel was , but escalated to a total of . The scheduled date of completion for the project was May 2016 and the executing agency was hopeful of finishing the job by December 2015, which was around five months ahead of the deadline. Later, due to a dispute between the construction workers and the executing agency, the work was delayed and the target of completion ahead of schedule couldn't be achieved. The next planned date was June 2016 which was then further extended to July 2016. On 12 October 2016, it was reported that almost all the work had been completed and the remaining work was planned to be finished in a few days and that \\"98 percent civil work including construction of 9 km tunnel and its approach road has been completed while the installation of equipment and gadgets like sound diffusers, ventilators, fans, firefighter equipment, electrical panels, transformers, lighting etc. inside the tunnel is under progress and likely to be completed in next 20-30 days.\\" They added that after the completion of remaining work, it has to pass the quality and commuters‚Äô safety tests, and that the entire process would be completed by last week of November and authorities will either inaugurate the \\"ambitious\\" project in last week or November of first week of December, depending upon the availability of representatives from Union Government. However the project had not been completed by January 2017 and there was an uproar in the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly, where the opposition legislators demanded to know why the tunnel was not opened stating that both Jammu-Srinagar and Jammu-Kishtwar National Highways are closed at various places due to land sliding and added that several passengers were trapped on both the Highways at various places. On 3 February 2017, official sources said that the project was getting delayed due to bad weather conditions and snowfall on the highway, which snapped the electricity supply to the area and so the executing agency was unable to continue with the required testing and inspection processes. According to a news article on 1 March 2017, the Independent Engineers (IEs) reported that the demonetisation on 8 November 2016 resulted in work getting affected drastically as the contractors failed to pay the labour involved in the work. Their report said that the contractors were unable to collect the tools and tackles of small amount due to the restrictions of amount withdrawal from the Bank accounts, and the subcontractors were not able to pay to daily labour wage which was around ‚Çπ200, besides being unable to purchase the essential material from local market due to non-availability of cash. The Construction Company's Executive, Shafaq Syed also confirmed, \\"Demonetisation crippled our working. We were unable to make payments to our subcontractors.

The two tubes ‚Äî each approximately 9 km long ‚Äî are connected by 29 cross passages at regular intervals of every 300 metres along the entire length of the tunnel. These passages add up to about 1 km of tunnel length, and the main and escape tubes, plus the cross passages make up about 19 km of tunnel length. Since such a long tunnel could present the problem of a lack of oxygen, to ensure that there is no excessive carbon- dioxide build-up inside, there are several exhaust metres that will check the air all through the length of the tunnel. With inlets, every 8 metres, bringing fresh air into the main tube, and exhaust outlets every 100 m opening into the escape tube, the tunnel is the country‚Äôs first ‚Äî and the world‚Äôs sixth ‚Äî road tunnel with a transverse ventilation system. Transverse ventilation will keep tailpipe smoke inside the tunnel at a minimum level in order to prevent suffocation and keep visibility at acceptable levels, especially since the tunnel is so long. The 29 cross passages between the two tunnels will be used to evacuate, through the escape tunnel, a user who might be in distress or to tow away any vehicle that might have broken down in the main tunnel. A total of 124 cameras and a linear heat detection system inside the tunnel will alert the Integrated Tunnel Control Room (ITCR) located outside the tunnel to the need for intervention. In the case of a traffic violation, the Control Room informs the traffic police deployed outside the tunnel, who shall impose a fine on errant drivers on the spot. SOS boxes installed every 150 m will act as emergency hotlines for commuters in distress. To connect to the ITCR to seek help, one would only need to open the door of the SOS box and say ‚ÄòHello‚Äô, said an executive of the project. Commuters can use their mobile phones inside the tunnel. To prevent diminution of vision as a result of change in the light while going in or coming out of the tunnel, the lighting inside has been adjusted at a gradient of luminous strength. The tunnel is built with fire safety measures. As soon as sensors detect fire, a safety protocol will kick in, and the pushing of fresh air will stop and only exhausts will function. Longitudinal exhaust fans installed at regular intervals will concentrate on 300 m on either side of the fire, pushing the smoke upward. Ambulances or vehicles carrying foam will rush through the escape tunnel to evacuate commuters and fight the fire. The heat detection system inside the tunnel will record rises in temperature in the tunnel ‚Äî the result of excessive emissions which may be caused by one or more vehicles. In such cases, the ITCR will get in touch with staff inside the tunnel, and the offending vehicle will be pulled over into a lay-by and subsequently removed by a crane through the parallel escape tunnel. The tunnel is located at an altitude of nearly 4,000 feet in difficult Himalayan terrain. Despite having been excavated in such geographic conditions, both tubes are completely waterproof. Because of this two-lane tunnel, the distance between Chenani and Nashri and hence between Jammu and Srinagar is reduced by 30 km and travel time is cut by two hours. The tunnel bypasses 44 avalanche and landslide-prone spots on the highway. It is an \\"all-weather\\" tunnel and enables an increase in trade and tourism in the state. The tunnel also has parking spots in case of vehicle breakdowns.

It was fought by the Vyborg‚ÄìJoensuu railroad between Vyborg, the Red capital in Eastern Finland, and Antrea, an important railroad junction 30 kilometres north of Vyborg. The Reds targeted Antrea, but were stuck between the railway stations of Kavantsaari and Hannila and the nearby villages of Ahvola and Pullila. The most fierce battles were fought in Ahvola which was a highway crossing few kilometres west of the railroad. For the last nine weeks the warfare was mostly trench warfare. Therefore, the battles in Ahvola were called as the ‚Ä≥Verdun of Finland‚Ä≥, after the famous 1916 Battle of Verdun, although its size is not anything compared with the one of World War I. The battle ended in late April, as the Whites attacked Vyborg from further east and the Reds pulled back to defend the city.  Units  = Whites = The White Army in Antrea Front included the paramilitary White Guards, the J√§ger troops and the Karelian Army. It was first commanded by colonel lieutenant Herman W√§rnhjelm who was replaced in 12 February by captain Aarne Sihvo and Woldemar H√§gglund as his staff officer. = Reds = The Red units were composed of the Red Guards from Vyborg area and further from the Uusimaa region of Southern Finland from Helsinki, Vantaa, Hyvink√§√§ and M√§nts√§l√§. Helsinki Red Guard included the famous Jyry Company, which was an elite squad composed of the members of the working-class athletes club Jyry Helsinki. Also a unit of the Women's Red Guard took part at the battle. The Russian volunteer brigades came from Saint Petersburg, Moscow and Siberia. They all left the Antrea Front in late February as the armistice between Soviet Russia and the German Empire was broken and the troops were needed elsewhere. A group of Baltic Fleet sailors were still fighting later in March in Ahvola. The Reds were commanded from by the Red Guards general staff in Vyborg, but they also had a local base in Kavantsaari. The commander-in-chief in Kavantsaari was the little-known factory worker A. Backman. Even his accurate identity is not clear, but Backman was presumably captured and then killed by the Whites in early May.  The battles  = White retreat from Vyborg = White artillery in Hannila Three days before the start of the War, the Whites attempted to take Vyborg under their control but failed. The 300-men unit fled the town and headed south across the ice of Vyborg Bay to the small island of Ven√§j√§nsaari. 26 January the Whites decided to head north of Vyborg to Antrea and meet their main forces. The squad was now led by Adolf Aminoff, a 62-year-old retired colonel of the Russian Imperial Army. It crossed the Saint Petersburg railway in the village of K√§m√§r√§, where they had a clash with the Red Guards. The Battle of K√§m√§r√§ is considered to be the first battle of the Finnish Civil War. After beating the Reds by the K√§m√§r√§ station, the Whites ambushed a Red train on its way from Saint Petersburg to Finland. The so-called ‚Ä≥Great Gun Train‚Ä≥ was carrying a large cargo of rifles, artillery pieces and ammunition. It was escorted by a squad of 400 members of the Saint Petersburg Finnish Red Guard commanded by brothers Jukka and Eino Rahja. The train stopped by the station and was surprised by the Whites. After the Reds got their machine guns into shooting positions, the Whites fled K√§m√§r√§ and continued their journey towards Antrea. The battles in K√§m√§r√§ ended up with 18 killed Whites and up to 30 killed Reds. The Whites finally reached Antrea in 28 January. The local White Guards had taken the railway stations of Kavatsaari and Hannila a day earlier. = The early stage = As the war started in 27 January, the Vyborg Reds advanced towards Antrea along the Vyborg-Joensuu railway. In 1 February they took the railway station in Tali, 10 kilometres north of Vyborg, and the next day the Karisalmi station 5 kilometres further north. In 9 February the Reds took the Kavantsaari railway station after a minor battle with the Whites. A day later the Reds lost it, but the next day they got reinforcements and took the station back again. 11 February the Reds also attacked the station of Hannila, but failed. Instead, they took the villages of Seistola and Ahvola located few kilometres west of the railroad. Ahvola was an important highway crossing of the Vyborg‚ÄìImatra and the Vyborg‚ÄìAntrea highways. In 12 February, the White commander Herman W√§rnhjelm ordered his men to retreat from Hannila across the Vuoksi river but the captain Aarne Sihvo refused to follow the order. Instead, Sihvo ordered his men to attack Ahvola, which the Whites then took. They also made a failed attack against Kavantsaari. W√§rnhjelm was now dismissed and replaced by Sihvo. The Reds in turn, lost a large number of their strength in the following days as the Russian volunteer brigades left the Antrea Front. Some minor attacks was still made, but after 24 February the front line was formed and the battle turned into a trench warfare. The both sides now had approximately 1,500 men in Ahvola and few hundred more in their other positions. = Ahvola and Pullila = The Red armoured train Ukrainsky Revolutsiya in Vyborg Since the late February, the battle concentrated to the village of Ahvola, about five kilometres west of the railway. The Reds attacked against the White lines daily at 9 AM and then pulled back to their own trenches as the Sun set. During this nine-week period, both sides lost approximately 20 men dead or wounded each day. The village of Pullila, five kilometres east of the railway, was held by the Reds. The Whites attacked the village couple of times but the attempts failed. = Battles along the railway = The five-kilometre part of the railway between Kavantsaari and Hannila was controlled by armoured trains so there was little infantry activity. The Reds had a Russian armoured train Ukrainsky Revolutsiya which the Bolsheviks had previously used in Ukraine. The other Red armoured train was Panssarijuna No. 4 (Armoured Train No. 4), made in the Fredriksberg Works in Helsinki. The Whites had an armoured train called Karjalan pelastaja (The Saviour of Karelia). It was nicknamed after the first battles in Hannila, where the train managed to hit the Reds back. The train itself was ‚Ä≥home made‚Ä≥, the Whites had armoured open wagons with bricks and planks and equipped it with a mountain gun and machine guns. The trains made some attacks against each other but usually without heavy losses. The major incident was in 23 March as the Ukrainsky Revolutsiya entered just 250 metres from the White lines and bombed the Hannila station for 20 minutes. The Whites managed to hit the train with a grenade but the Ukrainsky Revolutsiya was able to pull back with some help of Panssarijuna No. 4 and was then sent to Saint Petersburg for repairs. = The White Offensive = In 23 April, the Whites launched their decisive offensive against Vyborg with 15,000 men. The Antrea Whites now encircled the railway 30 kilometres east via the village of Heinjoki and then closed Vyborg from the east along the Saint Petersburg railway. The Reds were ordered to leave their positions and pull back to Vyborg in 24‚Äì25 April and the Whites reserves left in Antrea were now able to take Kavantsaari and Pullila without any fighting. After the Battle of Vyborg in 24‚Äì29 April, the Civil War in Karelia was over. A White Nieuport 17 fighter in Antrea Airfield  Aviation  = Whites = Two German imported DFW C.V reconnaissance planes were flown to Antrea in late March under the command of the Danish lieutenant Knud von Clauson-Kaas. The planes were not used in action as the Swedish pilots refused to fly in demanding conditions. On 10‚Äì11 April, six Russian pilots defected Soviet Russia and joined the Finnish Whites with a Grigorovich M-9 flying boat, two Nieuport 10 reconnaissance planes and two Nieuport 17 fighters. The pilots were supporters of the Russian White movement. From 13 April, the Russian pilots made reconnaissance flights, bombed the Red positions and dropped propaganda leaflets. The planes operated from the Antrea Airfield in the ice of lake P√§√§hkj√§rvi. This is considered to be the beginning of the Finnish Air Force. = Reds = The Reds had two Russian Nieuport flying boats which were flown by three Russian pilots. They operated from the ice of the Pantsarlahti Bay in Vyborg. The planes made at least four reconnaissance and bombing flights between late February and the end of March.  Culture  The Finish composer Leevi Madetoja lost his brother during the Battle of Antrea as Yrj√∂ Madetoja (b. 1885) was presumably captured and killed by the Reds in Kavantsaari 9 April. Madetoja composed a three-movement piano suite, The Garden of Death, Op. 41, for the memory of his lost brother.

Built in the early 1900s for Elmer Darling, a locally- born New York hotelier, it was one of Vermont's largest such estates, featuring Burklyn Hall, one of its most opulent Colonial Revival houses, as well as numerous 19th-century farm properties. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. Description and history Elmer Darling, a native of Burke, made a fortune operating the Fifth Avenue Hotel in New York City. He began purchasing properties on Darling Hill (then known as Bemis) in 1883, and had by the early 20th century amassed more than 2,000 acres of farmland encompassing an entire ridge north of Lyndon and west of East Burke. Properties on this ridge had largely begun has hill farms in the early 19th century, and Darling's purchases included farm buildings spanning the 19th century in age. Darling transformed this area into a gentleman's farm, which was primarily operated out of Mountain View Farm, located at junction of Darling Hill and East Darling Hill Roads. In the 1890s Darling built a state-of-the-art creamery, and later expanded into the breeding of Morgan horses. He had all of the older farm buildings restored, and lined Darling Hill Road with a canopy of trees that is still largely in place. Darling died here in 1931, and his heirs sold off the Mountain View Farm in 1960. Burklyn Hall is located at the highest point of the Darling Hill ridge, which extends north-south in northeastern Lyndon and southern Burke. The house is a large three-story wood-frame structure resting on a granite foundation. Its main section is square, covered by a hip roof with gabled dormers and a balustraded widow's walk at the center. Projecting south along the ridge is a long ell. The main entrance faces north, under a massive two-story Greek temple facade, and a porte-coch√®re on the west side is joined to an outbuilding housing a lavishly decorated billiard room. The interior, in particular the four great rooms of the main floor, feature elaborate carved woodwork and plaster moldings. There are formal gardens just south of the hall, separating it from a small conservatory. The hall is named for its position on the town line, and was designed by the architectural firm Jardine, Kent & Jardine and built in 1904-08. It features amenities not normally found in domestic architecture of the period, including elevators and a central vacuuming system. with See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Caledonia County, Vermont References Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Vermont National Register of Historic Places in Caledonia County, Vermont Burke, Vermont Lyndon, Vermont Historic districts in Caledonia County, Vermont ","title":"Darling Estate Historic District"},{"id":"52584445","text":"Fernando Coniglio (born 24 November 1991) is an Argentine footballer who plays for Hurac√°n as a forward.

He was a signatory of the Charter 77 human rights declaration against the communist government of Czechoslovakia. Early life Kohout studied electrical engineering at the College of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Plzen (now the University of West Bohemia). He was active in the Czech underground, as part of a movement known as the Second Culture. As a result of his political activities, he was forced to work in blue-collar occupations, such as several years working as a coal stoker at the Ethnographic Museum in Prague. In 1986 he was exiled from Czechoslovakia by the secret police, and spent two years in the Traiskirchen refugee camp in Austria. In the United States He was granted political asylum in the United States, and moved to Boston, gaining a diploma from Tufts School of the Museum of Fine Arts in 1993. He has taught performance art as political action at Tufts School and at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design, and video production at the New England Institute of Art. During his years in Boston he created was engaged in experimental performance art, focused mainly on politics, human rights, and criticism of religious organizations and ideologies. Between 1992 and 2003 he worked as a camera operator, video technician, and producer for news and public affairs cable TV channel C-SPAN. He has written a series of interviews for the Czech magazine Xantypa with subjects such as Noam Chomsky and Kurt Vonnegut Jr.. Artwork and later career Since 1994 he has been a member of the Mobius art group. He has participated in several international festivals and art programs (including festivals in China, Croatia, Poland, Taiwan, Cuba, Thailand, Israel, Canada, Mexico, and the United States). He has also lectured at the University of West Bohemia in Plzen. Kohout's art criticises the US economy, religion, the media, the politics of oil, racism and social prejudice. His works include a performance art piece critical of the segregation wall in Usti nad Labem, Czech Republic, where in 1999, as a protest against the segregation of Czech Roma, he cut the flag of the Czech Republic in half, and was subsequently accused of defaming the state symbol. In 2007 he was arrested in Boston after his performance \\"Nooses on Sale\\", which was critical of the conduct of US banks during the sub-prime mortgage crisis. The performance involved Kohout selling nooses outside a branch of the Bank of America, and after the bank reported him to the police, he was prosecuted for peddling goods without a licence. After a four-month trial he was found not guilty. In 2011, he recorded a five-part autobiographical show for Czech Radio. He also appeared in the documentary film Radical Jesters, about political performance artists in the United States. In 2015 he appeared on the Czech TV show You Have the Word, arguing in favour of the Czech Republic accepting large numbers of refugees. Kohout described this as a political performance, but it sparked a negative reaction from the public and in the media. A letter by Milos Forman to Milan Kohout in which he speaks highly of Kohout's book. In September 2016 Kohout announced his candidacy for the 2018 Czech presidential elections, though in the event he did not start campaigning and was not a candidate in the election.

His creative and powerful sculptures and reliefs have been exhibited in museums, galleries, international shows, studios, and private residences throughout the U.S., Western Europe, and the Middle East. Al- Zahawi's works derive much inspiration from African Art, select Western artists, and his own background as an Iraqi Muslim. Al-Zahawi was born in Baghdad, Iraq, the son of an Iraqi lawyer from a prominent family of Kurdish origin, Dhafir Al-Zahawi, whose grand-uncle was the progressive Iraqi poet and scholar, Jamil Sidqi Al-Zahawi. As a budding artist, Al-Zahawi in the late 1950s began experimenting with a wide variety of artistic mediums eventually selecting ceramic sculptures constructed using the method of coiling. His forms have been described as \\"ancient\\", \\"whimsical\\", \\"sensual\\", \\"aggressive\\", and \\"powerful\\" all achieved through the textures, hollow spaces, earthy hues, and angular shapes that define this body of work. Al-Zahawi lived most of his life outside of his native Iraq, residing in Geneva, Switzerland where he worked with the United Nations International Telecommunication Union. In his later years, he lived in Cairo, Egypt, and later in California. While war, sanctions, and civil strife thwarted his desire to eventually return to Iraq, he was able to portray his pride and love for his heritage through his art. Glyn Uzzell an artist and art teacher, as well as a long-time mentor of Al- Zahawi, once wrote: \\"It is clear that Zahawi has drawn strength and inspiration from a number of separate entities to forge a single style, uniquely his own.\\"  Early life  Muqbil Al-Zahawi was born in Baghdad, Iraq to Dhafir Al-Zahawi and Najia Baban, the last of seven children. His father was an Iraqi lawyer hailing from a long line of prominent Iraqis, which included bureaucrats, religious authorities (Mufti), poets, and scholars of Kurdish origin. He lived in Baghdad and attended the Jesuit's Baghdad College as well as the Institute of Fine Arts as an aspiring pianist. In 1950, at the age of 15 years old, Al-Zahawi moved to Cairo, Egypt with his mother. The popular uprising that overthrew King Farouk in 1952 and the eventual rise of the populist leader, Gamal Abdel-Nasser, instilled a sense of pride and patriotism in Al-Zahawi, which heavily influenced his life and his art. After moving to Santa Ana, California in 1952, he pursued different creative enterprises from drawing to fashion, music to acting, and eventually graduated with a B.A. in International Relations from the University of Southern California in 1957.  Beginnings as a ceramicist  thumb In 1958 Al-Zahawi moved to London to begin his post-graduate studies at the University College London in international relations. It was in London that Al-Zahawi decided to devote time to nurture his creative passions by simultaneously enrolling at London's Central School of Art and Design. At the Central School of Art, he began to devote his time to understanding terracotta ceramic sculptures, where he selected the coiling method. Through coiling, he felt he had complete control over the power evoked from his sculptures, which could not be achieved by the pinching method or throwing on a mechanical wheel. Al-Zahawi's early works took on more simplistic designs, extenuated by smoother lines, colorless texture (lacking stain), and relatively uniform spaces. This began to change when Al-Zahawi was introduced to primitive art, especially African Art through visits to the British Museum among other galleries and museums. Without a doubt African sculpture had a profound influence on his art thereafter. He would later travel and live in Africa (1965-1967) as a civil servant for the United Nations' mission in the Congo, only serving to reinforce his love and admiration of African art.  Switzerland  After completing his post- graduate diploma at University College London and studied at the Center School of Art, Al-Zahawi began Ph.D. studies at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies. It is here that his art began to flourish and receive critical acclaim. His first one-man show took place at Galerie Club and Galerie Connaitre in 1962. During this time he also forged close bonds with the artists at Galerie Contemporaine in Carouge, Geneva including Glyn Uzzell, where he became one of the permanent artists from 1964‚Äì1982. Glyn Uzzell said, \\"when Muqbil Zahawi presented his first exhibition of ceramic sculpture in Geneva in 1962, it was immediately clear that one was in the presence of a highly original artist.\\" After several years abroad, Al-Zahawi returned to Geneva in 1967 to begin working with the International Telecommunication Union. During this time, Al-Zahawi found fortune exhibiting all over Switzerland and Europe. He also began to experiment with new techniques including enlarging his sculptures and coloring his creations with his proprietary staining method. One of his most notable exhibitions of this period in the 1960s was a one-man show at the prestigious Musee Ariana in Geneva. His work was well received and some of his pieces were later acquired by the Museum as part of their permanent collection. In 1973 Al-Zahawi received a rare opportunity to undertake a one-man show in Neuchatel, Switzerland in the large exhibition halls of the Musee d‚ÄôArt et d‚ÄôHistorie. What concerned him was the imbalance between the floor pieces and the abundance of bare wall space. He confided in Glyn Uzzell who suggested that Al-Zahawi try wall reliefs to complement his sculptures. Reliefs, as it turned out, was the perfect medium for his work given that this style of artistic display is historic in nature and therefore well-suited to Al- Zahawi's art that itself evokes an ancient and mysterious aura. He began to try his hands at various relief sizes, sketching each block, and masterfully bringing his sketches to life. Through this experiment, he was able to open up his work to a whole new audience that appreciated and actively acquired his wall mounted ceramic art. The Neuchatel exhibition also pushed Al-Zahawi to test the bounds of physics by constructing much larger pieces. He endured a number of setbacks in the process where he created pieces that were too large to transport, bake (fire), and exhibit. After several attempts, he discovered that by creating the sculptures in two parts, one fitting inside the other for balance, he could build sculptures of the height and magnitude he hoped. The result: The Three Warriors, each over 6 feet tall, which became the centerpieces that anchored the Neuchatel exhibition.  Iraqi artists & Baghdad  Seated Lady (1992) Iraqi artists have consistently been at the forefront of new and innovative works of creative genius in the Middle East. From poets to scholars, sculptors to painters, the community of Iraqi artists, local and international, experimented with avant-garde and cutting-edge art, and found an insatiable audience that was often blind to gender, socioeconomic status, or identity. However, during the past 40 years, the art of Iraq and the voices of the artists has certainly paralleled the tumultuous political and social history of the country, creating an inextricable union that has been displayed in all forms of art. By the late 1970s Al-Zahawi's art was a true juxtaposition between the populist fervor of Pan-Arabism, the Decolonization of Africa, and rise of a new brand of nationalism, Ba'athism, in Iraq, contrasted with the influences of Western sculptors and painters including Henry Moore and Pablo Picasso. While Al-Zahawi had resided outside of the Middle East since 1952, he did have the opportunity to exhibit in Iraq in 1974 and again in 1977 at the behest of the Iraqi government. His 1977 exhibit offered an opportunity for Al-Zahawi to reengage his roots through his art. The exhibition showcased a number of unique pieces, and as a result of his hard work, the show was a resounding success, receiving patrons from all over Baghdad. Some of his pieces were eventually purchased for permanent acquisition by the Museum of Modern Art in Baghdad and National Gallery of Fine Arts in Amman, Jordan. Though this exhibition would be the last time Al- Zahawi would return to his native Iraq, given the political instability that beleaguered the nation, his love for Iraq remained steadfast and continued to be visible in his art thereafter.  Later years  Al-Zahawi ushered in the 1980s with style undertaking several successful exhibitions including one in Sion, Switzerland in 1980. However, Al-Zahawi left Geneva in 1982 and took a prolonged hiatus that saw him exhibit only a handful of times in California and later Cairo, where he had relocated with his family. In 1994 he had a received a fairly large commission for a collective show at the Riverside Art Museum in Riverside, California. Of the exhibition, a critic said that \\"Among the dimensions that Zahawi's methods bring to his work are not only the clear signs of the artist's hands seen on every piece but include a generous measure of the artist's emotional attitudes in all their variety. You will find sculptures that speak of power and strength, of sensuality, of calligraphy and ancient knowledge, and of delightful bits of whimsy.\\" Al-Zahawi undertook his last exhibition in 1998 at the age of 63 at Galerie de la Tour in Altkirch, France. With this one-man show, he brought to a close an illustrious career that spanned five decades. From 1958-1998 he exhibited in various countries across Europe, the Middle East, and the U.S. in countless galleries, museums, international shows, studios, and private residencies.  Influences  Sabra & Shatilla (1992) named after the horrific massacre of 1982 Al-Zahawi had several notable influences in the development of his art. Glyn Uzzell commented \\"Muqbil Zahawi was born in Baghdad, but has studied and lived in the United States for long periods. He has also lived and worked in Africa. Whether consciously acquired or unconsciously assimilated, the influences of these widely differing cultures are reflected in his art.\\" Indeed, African art dominated his early works and continued throughout his life. The powerful images of the art from the continent were especially powerful to Al-Zahawi, who saw them as direct, unequivocal, and uncompromising. As he began to study and interact with the works of European artists, he infused their influences in his art. This was especially visible in Al-Zahawi's reliefs, which allowed him to create images that were influenced by his contemporaries, such as Henry Moore and Pablo Picasso who dominated the art scene throughout Al-Zahawi's active years. Alongside these influences was his own background as an Iraqi and a Muslim. As a firm believer in Pan-Arabism and the zeitgeist of the 1960s and 1970s, his art began to reflect a sense of nationalism and historical significance. This related not only political sentiments but also religious narratives. It is \\"no coincidence that the climax of [his] body of work, with their tense and vibrant shapes, coincided with the effects of the volatile political landscape of his day.\\" He once said, \\"Art should move people because of its total inner as well as outer form, not just by a work's decorative aspects. People do not need to fall in love with it, but it must elicit a strong emotional feeling,\\" a feeling very much rooted in the political milieu of the time. The influences of his art not only dictated the shapes, colors, and designs, but also the display of his art with rougher textures, muted colors, and more edgy forms, all captured by his unique artistic methodology. One well known British art critic, Peter Fuller, commented, \\"The fantastic imagery of Eastern craftsmanship, with its perpetual insistence of a combination of fantastic, formal opulence and executive precision, synthesis with a proto-surrealist relish in suggestively aggressive symbol‚Ä¶they remain among the more powerful creations of his genre.\\"  Methodology  Hand Sketches (1970s) Through decades of experience, Al-Zahawi was able to formulate unique methods in crafting work that not only served to distinguish him as an artist but ensured his contribution to the field of ceramics through his novel approach in sketching, sculpting, and staining. = Sketching = Al-Zahawi began the process of his art through musings and pencil sketches. He notes that often these ideas come to him in his dreams, forcing him to wake up late at night to put the designs to paper so as to capture them in their most accurate and vivid form. Often these sketches, each unique in their own right, are combined and refined to eventually come to life through his art. = Coiling = Through the process of developing his art, Al-Zahawi tried various methods of sculpting, yet he vastly preferred the coiling method. The coiling method allows the artists to create irregular forms with superimposed volume and with angles as sharp as 45¬∞, collectively allowing for the construction of very large forms that can reach up to 7 feet high with a diameter as wide as 4 feet. As each inch is built, coil by coil, similar to how one builds a house, the final product becomes a one of a kind form that is rarely repeated, and oftentimes goes far beyond traditional ceramics. = Reliefs = Reliefs are slightly more complicated than his sculptures. The pieces have to be completed as quickly as possible, sometimes within one day, so that they do not dry and contract in size. When a relief was finished, Al-Zahawi would cut the relief into equal-sized cross-sections that fit wooden squares (approximately 8 inches sq.) so as to allow each square to have its own design portion. Each square is then fired at 1000 ¬∞C (biscuit firing). Once firing is complete, each square is mounted back onto a large wooden surface to reconstruct the relief into its original design. Often the pieces do not align perfectly but this adds a more unique and creative element to the final finish. = Staining = As Glyn Uzzell noted, \\"Zahawi rejects the use of glazes, feeling that they can disguise the artist's intention with a superficially enhancing gloss. All of his works are stained in the natural colors of earth or atmosphere, and in a manner that shows the direct presence of the artist's hand.\\" Al-Zahawi overtime concocted his own recipe of wax, turpentine, and powder from various minerals to achieve the right composition to stain his sculptures and reliefs. The stains or mineral powder (such as Hematite) are earth colors in various hues of brown, black, green, and blue. These colors are also accented by the original colors of the clay (red, white, or gray) to provide a further rich texture. After the stain is applied to the ceramic piece, Al-Zahawi would use a cloth with turpentine to remove some of the stain and reveal the texture of clay and patterns of the rib tool. The stain is then protected by a transparent wax that has limited shine but nevertheless allows the colors and shades of the stain and the rich texture to become more pronounced. Al-Zahawi has also experimented with engraving designs on the surface of certain sculptures to bring out a particular area or special form. With staining versus glazing, these engravings are extenuated and truly give the art a unique and exotic feel.  Personal  Al-Zahawi was married to Selma Al-Radi, a renowned Iraqi archaeologist and sister to famed Iraqi artist Nuha Al-Radi, and had a child from his first marriage, Rakan Al-Zahawi. Al-Zahawi later married Muazaz Amin Aziz, an Iraqi-Kurdish immigration lawyer, and had two children, Reem Al-Zahawi and Hamada Zahawi.  Exhibitions  Al-Zahawi exhibited in a wide number of forums throughout his 40 years as an active artist. = One-man shows = 1962 - Galerie Club  Geneva, Switzerland 1962 - Galerie Connaitre  Geneva, Switzerland 1964, 1968, 1971, 1975, 1980 - Galerie Contemporaine  Geneva, Switzerland 1965 - Paul Rivas Gallery  Los Angeles, California (US) 1969 - Musee de l'Ariana  Geneva, Switzerland 1969 - Larsen Gallery  New York (US) 1971 - Ansdell Gallery  London, UK 1971 - Studio 5  New York (US) 1973 - d‚ÄôArt et d‚ÄôHistorie  Neuchatel, Switzerland 1976 - Galerie de le Cathedrale  Fribourg, Switzerland 1977, 1980 - Galerie Grand Fontaine  Sion, Switzerland 1977 - Museum of Modern Art  Baghdad, Iraq 1978 - Galerie Nydegg  Berne, Switzerland 1980 - Galeria Picpus  Montreux, Switzerland 1991 - Laguna Village  Laguna Beach, California (US) 1992, 1993 - Artist Studio  Cairo, Egypt 1994 - Riverside Art Museum  Riverside, California (US) 1998 - Galerie de la Tour  Altkirch, France = Collective Shows = 1964, 1970, 1974 - Galerie Contemporaine  Geneva, Switzerland 1968, 1971 - Hotel Intercontinental]  Geneva, Switzerland 1969 - Salle Simon, I, Patino  Geneva, Switzerland 1972 - Musee Bellerive  Zurich, Switzerland 1974 - Galerie Maurice Colle & Cie  Geneva, Switzerland 1974 - Museum of Modern Art  Baghdad, Iraq 1976 - Biennale de Venise  Venice, Italy 1978 - Musee Rath  Geneva, Switzerland 1980 - Musee de l'Athenee  Geneva, Switzerland 1980 - Parc de la Mairie de Venier  Geneva, Switzerland 1981 - Palais d'Exposition (Artisites Suisses)  Delemont, Switzerland 1992 - Mandel Co. ‚Äì Pacific Design Center  Los Angeles, California (US) 1992 - Mandel Co.

Here are a select few: \\"He has a very fine sense of form and his work has an inner vitality that is the result of a clear concept, directly expressed.

Fagernes lies on the north side of Beis Fjord just southeast of Narvik and north of Ankenesstranda (Ankenes). Today Fagernes is best known as the terminus of the Ofoten Line. The Ofoten Line has its terminus at the Fagernes terminal, a large industrial area of Fagernes.Framstad, Anders Park, & Marius Lorentzen. 2013. Narvik frykter ikke Northland-konkurs. E24 (February 6). History In the 1800s there was a large farm called Fagernes g√•rd 'Fagernes farm' where Fagernes stands today. The farm was the largest and wealthiest in the inner part of the Ofoten district, which later became part of the former municipality of Ankenes. This farm was of central importance in the effort to get the railroad built from Kiruna to Narvik in the late 1800s. The wealthy farmer Statius Mosling (1853‚Äì1934) at the Fagernes farm was very eager to have the railroad built to Narvik.Danielsen, Roger. 2014. Kong Olavs vei ‚Äì veien som forener Nordkalotten. Fremover (September 22). It was also due to Mosling that the Ofoten Line ends in Fagernes and not in Narvik. When Narvik was separated from Ankenes as its own urban municipality in 1902, Fagernes was also included with it. Community Today, Fagernes is a suburb of Narvik, mainly consisting of residential buildings and an industrial area called the Fagernes terminal ().Johnsen, √òyvind. 2015.

To the south, Fagernes is connected to Ankenesstranda (Ankenes), also in the municipality of Narvik, by E6 via the Beisfjord Bridge over Beis Fjord. Further to the east, County Road 751 connects Fagernes to the village of Beisfjord. Fagernes is also connected to Narvik by rail via the Ofoten Line, but this part of the Ofoten Line is only a freight route and there is no passenger transport on the route. Nordland county also offers bus service from Narvik via Fagernes to Beisfjord, Ankenesstranda (Ankenes), and H√•kvik. =Schools= Narvik Montessori School in Fagernes is a primary school offering first- to seventh-grade education.Hanssen, Ann-Kristin. 2013.

They include removing sharks by various fishing methods, separating people and sharks, as well as observation, education and various technology-based solutions. Techniques that involve culling sharks are contentious. Environmental groups have voiced concern over the impact of reduced shark numbers on ocean ecosystems and the problem of by-catch of other marine life, particularly endangered species. Because sharks are important to the ecosystem, killing them harms the ecosystem.https://eu.oceana.org/en/importance-sharks Eu.oceana.org. The Importance of Sharks in the Ecosystem. Retrieved September 20, 2018.Sharks are the apex predators in marine ecosystems, which means they have few natural predators and feed on animals below them in the food web. Sharks limit the abundance of their prey and that affects the prey of those animals throughout the food web. They also directly or indirectly affect all levels of the food web, and help to maintain structure in healthy ocean ecosystems. Sharks also play an important role with carbon and they help keep it out of the earth's atmosphere. Since sharks support seagrass, and seagrass absorb vast amounts of carbon, then sharks store vast amounts of carbon in their bodies preventing it from escaping and reducing the ocean's capacity to store carbon by millions.https://www.mysticaquarium.org/2017/07/26/need- sharks-healthy-oceans-healthy- planet/#:~:text=Sharks%20keep%20ocean%20ecosystems%20in%20balance&text;=Because%20sharks%20directly%20or%20indirectly,their%20prey%20species%20through%20fear. Nets =Shark net= The majority of shark nets used are gillnets, which is a wall of netting that hangs in the water and captures the targeted sharks by entanglement. The nets may be as much as long, set at a depth of , have a mesh size of and are designed to catch sharks longer than in length. Shark nets do not offer complete protection but work on the principle of \\"fewer sharks, fewer attacks\\". They reduce occurrence via shark mortality. Shark nets such as those in New South Wales are designed to entangle and kill sharks and other animals that pass near them. Historical shark attack figures suggest that the use of shark nets does markedly reduce the incidence of shark attack when implemented on a regular and consistent basis. A downside with shark nets is that they do result in bycatch, including threatened and endangered species. Between September 2017 and April 2018, 403 animals were killed in the nets in New South Wales, including 10 critically endangered grey nurse sharks, 7 dolphins, 7 green turtles and 14 great white sharks.http://www.swellnet.com/news/swellnet-dispatch/2018/08/04/sydney-shark- nets-set-stay-despite-drumline-success Swellnet.com.

Shark barriers form a fully enclosed swimming area that prevents sharks from entering. Shark barrier design has evolved from rudimentary fencing materials to netted structures held in place with buoys and anchors. Recent designs have used plastics to increase strength and versatility. When deployed in sheltered areas shark barriers offer complete protection and are seen as a more environmentally friendly option as they largely avoid bycatch. However barriers are not effective on surf beaches because they usually disintegrate in the swell and so are normally constructed only around sheltered areas such as harbour beaches. A shark barrier installed at Middleton beach in Albany, Western Australia cost to install, with annual maintenance budgeted at per annum. On R√©union Island in 2015 two shark proof enclosures cost ‚Ç¨2 million to install and ‚Ç¨1 million a year to maintain. Drum lines A drum line is an unmanned aquatic trap used to lure and capture large sharks using baited hooks. They are typically deployed near popular swimming beaches with the intention of reducing the number of sharks in the vicinity and therefore the probability of shark attack. Drum lines were first deployed to protect users of the marine environment from sharks in Queensland, Australia in 1962. During this time, they were just as successful in reducing the frequency of shark attacks as the shark nets. More recently, drumlines have also been used with great success in Recife, Brazil where the number of attacks has been shown to have reduced by 97% when the drumlines are deployed. While shark nets and drum lines share the same purpose, drum lines are more effective at targeting the three sharks that are considered most dangerous to swimmers: the bull shark, tiger shark and great white shark. SMART drumlines can also be utilised to move sharks, which greatly reduces mortality of sharks and bycatch to less than 2%. In 2014 a three-month trial utilising up to 60 drum lines in Western Australia cost . Drum line programmes that involve culling have been criticized for being environmentally destructive and speciesist, and have sparked public demonstrations and vocal opposition, particularly from environmentalists, animal welfare advocates and ocean activists.

However environmental damage from drumlines is minor compared to commercial fishing with estimates of 50 million sharks caught unintentionally each year. Other protection methods A sign at Pyramid Rock Beach in Hawaii warning about a shark sighting, 2015 =Moving sharks= Moving sharks is a way of reducing shark attacks and reducing shark mortality, by capturing, transporting and releasing the sharks further shore. In Recife, Brazil, sharks that were near shore were captured and physically moved offshore with 70% of potentially aggressive sharks and 78% of other animals caught released alive. Sharks that were moved did not return to the same location. This technique has also been successfully demonstrated in the NSW North Coast SMART drumline trial (Australia) where 99% of targeted sharks and 98% of other animals caught were released alive. The West Australian Government are now trialling the same technique along Western Australia's South West coast, near Gracetown. =Shark shield= Shark Shield is a personal electronic device that creates an electromagnetic field to deter shark attacks and is used by surfers, scuba divers, spearfishing, and ocean kayak fishing. It has been considered one of the few electrical devices on the market that has performed independent trials to determine the effectiveness at deterring shark attacks. However note that the Shark Shield does not work in all situations and divers have been attacked whilst wearing Shark Shield. The West Australian government has also announced that they are supporting the Shark Shield FREEDOM 7 and the Ocean Guardian FREEDOM+ Surf via a $200 subsidiary. =Shark tagging and tracking= Across the world a sample of sharks have been tagged with electronic devices that transmit their location. Acoustic tags transmit pulses which are detected by underwater listening stations when the sharks swim close by, typically within 500 metres. Fin-mounted satellite tags are also commonly used. These tags allow shark movements and behaviour to be monitored and studied and swimmers and surfers can be warned if a shark is detected close to shore. However a limitation with the system is the tagging will only highlight a very small portion of the dangerous sharks present. It also may lead people into a false sense of security. =Shark spotting= Shark-spotting programs using drones, fixed wing aircraft, helicopters, beach patrols, observation towers and even blimps, are being used and trialled in various locations across the globe. However visibility issues with water clarity can be a problem particularly with aerial patrols, which have been found to identify less than 20% of sharks present. There is also the financial cost of hiring aircraft and/or personnel to conduct the surveillance. = Personal shark repellents = A shark repellent is any method of driving sharks away from an area and includes magnetic shark repellent, electropositive shark repellents, electrical repellents (including Shark Shield) and semiochemicals. One example is a product called Anti-Shark 100 which is an aerosol can that contains an extract of dead shark tissue. There is a range of evidence that supports the effectiveness of this product. Chemical repellents have been researched since before the 1940s, some of which have raised concerns as to their effectiveness. The semiochemical used in the Anti-shark 100 product have been independently tested & verified on Caribbean reef sharks, however there are concerns it may attract Tiger and White sharks. Other examples of personal shark protection technologies include wearing interruption patterned or camouflage wetsuits, magnetic repellents incorporating a small magnet in a band worn on the wrist or ankle, acoustic repellents that mimic the sound of orcas and changing surf board colours. However, either the products associated with these technologies have not been independently tested, or independent tests highlighted that they did not work. In 2018 independent tests were carried out on five Shark Repellent technologies using Great white sharks. Only Shark Shield‚Äôs Ocean Guardian Freedom+ Surf showed measureable results, with encounters reduced from 96% to 40%. Rpela (electrical repellent technology), SharkBanz bracelet & SharkBanz surf leash (magnetic shark repellent technology) and Chillax Wax (semiochemical) showed no measureable effect on reducing shark attacks. = Protection by dolphins = There are documented instances of bottlenose dolphins protecting humans from shark attacks, one off the coast of New Zealand in 2004 and one attack on a surfer in northern California in August 2007. There is no accepted explanation for this behavior; as mentioned in the Journal of Zoology, \\"The importance of interactions between sharks and cetaceans has been a subject of much conjecture, but few studies have addressed these interactions\\". In some cases, sharks have been seen attacking, or trying to attack dolphins.http://www.abcactionnews.com/news/local/story/Rehabilitated-dolphin- dies-after-shark-attack/Os5uEUUiFU2NukbdnqiZXQ.cspx The presence of porpoises does not indicate the absence of sharks as both eat the same food and surfers have been attacked by sharks whilst in the presence of dolphins. = Shark sonar = In September 2015, a shark sonar created by Ric Richardson was tested in Byron Bay, Australia. It is a passive sonar device that does not interfere with animals like dolphins. The final device will sit on the ocean floor and claimed to detect sharks over 2,5 meters long when they are 100 meters away. An alarm will notify people that they have to go out of the water. Other shark sonar systems have been tested, however results have concluded that the shark sonar systems are not effective.  By country  = Australia =  Queensland and New South Wales  Graph of sharks caught in Queensland's shark control program (by type) July 1997- June 2014 In Queensland and NSW systematic long term shark control programs using shark nets and drumlines are utilised to reduce the risk of shark attack. Since 1936 sharks nets have been utilised off Sydney beaches. Nowadays they are employed on both NSW and Queensland beaches; 83 beaches are meshed in Queensland compared with NSW's current 51. The technique of setting drum lines is also used in Queensland and New South Wales, where they have been used in association with shark nets. Before 1962, there were 82 recorded attacks. Since the policy was implemented there has only been one recorded death, at Amity Point in January 2006. 21-year-old Sarah Kate Whiley was attacked by as many as three sharks in Rainbow Channel. The attack occurred in an unpatrolled area. Queensland Fisheries Minister John McVeigh has described the longevity of the netting and drum line program as being \\"a good indicator that it had the support of most Queenslanders\\". The baited drum lines attract sharks from within a 3-5 km radius, preventing sharks from reaching swimming areas. They also capture less bycatch than shark nets. There were a total of 97 fatalities attributed to shark attacks in Queensland between 1858 and 2014. In New South Wales there were a total of 96 fatalities attributed to shark attack between 1771 and 2014. The current shark-killing programs in Queensland and New South Wales have been called culls, and have been criticized by environmentalists, who say killing sharks harms the marine ecosystem. Between 1950 and 2008, 577 great white sharks and 352 tiger sharks were killed in the nets in New South Wales ‚Äî also during this period, 15,135 marine animals were caught and killed in the nets, including whales, turtles, rays, dolphins, and dugongs.https://web.archive.org/web/20181002102324/https://www.marineconservation.org.au/pages/shark- culling.html Marineconservation.org.au.

Five nets were deployed off Seven Mile Beach off Lennox Head; Sharpes, Shelly and Lighthouse beaches off Ballina; and Main Beach at Evans Head. Twenty five drumlines were also deployed among nets at Ballina and Evans Head beaches (15 off Ballina; 10 off Evans Head). The trial was successful with no shark attacks occurring at the protected beaches. The SMART drumline caught 230 targeted sharks with 99% of targeted sharks and 98% of other animals caught were released alive. The SMART drumlines are now being expanded to other NSW regions. The shark net trial caught 11 targeted sharks and had a 54% survival rate for all animals caught and will not be continued.  Western Australia  Middleton Beach shark barrier, Albany, Western Australia In August 2018 following continual shark attacks and public pressure the West Australian state government announced a 12-month trial of \\"smart\\" drumlines along Western Australia's South West coast, near Gracetown. Western Australia also deploys shark enclosures in a range of locations as well as aerial shark spotters, beach patrols, shark tagging efforts and associated tracking and notification systems. There were a total of 114 unprovoked shark attacks in West Australia between 1870 and 2016,Global shark attack file > Incident Log SharkAttackFile.net Accessed 2018-08-14 including 16 fatalities since 2000.  South Australia  In South Australia, spotter planes and a small number of patrolled swimming beaches are the only methods used to mitigate the risk of shark attack. On 6 February 2014, Port Lincoln tuna \\"baron\\" Hagen Stehr expressed his support for the Western Australian shark cull. He also stated that his business' spotter planes had observed increases in great white shark numbers off the west coast of Eyre Peninsula. He acknowledged that his tuna farming operations attract some sharks. He told The Advertiser that he believed \\"selected culling of sharks is a must. It is crazy stuff to put them under protection so it becomes a major offence to kill them.\\" Critics of Stehr's stance note that a cull of sharks in SA would be beneficial to his business, as tuna is a major source of food for sharks. Shark attack survivor turned conservationist Rodney Fox has spoken out against the cull, saying \\"When a shark attacks someone, we go 'the shark needs to be punished'. They don't live under our laws. It's a different world down there and it should be treated differently.\\" At September 2014, there had been a total of 82 shark attacks in South Australia since 1836, including 20 fatalities.Global shark attack file > Incident Log SharkAttackFile.net Accessed 2014-02-09. = South Africa = Shark spotting information sign at Noordhoek Beach in South Africa (2015) In KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa a long term shark control program utilising a combination of shark nets and drum lines are used to mitigate the risk of shark attack. The region's shark attack statistics primarily reflect the effectiveness of netting, as drum lines were only introduced recently, following their successful use for over 40 years in Queensland, Australia. The KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board (KZNSB) says \\"Both types of equipment function by reducing shark numbers in the vicinity of protected beaches, thereby lowering the probability of encounters between sharks and people at those beaches.\\" The KZNSB says, \\"At Durban, from 1943 until the installation of shark nets in 1952, there were seven fatal attacks. Since the installation of nets there have been no fatalities at Durban and no incidents resulting in serious injury.\\" The KZNSB also says, \\"At KwaZulu-Natal's other [netted] beaches, from 1940 until most of those beaches were first netted in the 1960s, there were 16 fatal attacks and 11 resulting in serious injury. In the three decades since nets were installed, there have been no fatal attacks at those beaches and only four resulting in serious injury.\\" The presence of nets has greatly reduced the number of shark attacks along Natal beaches. It is unclear whether more sharks caught on drum lines survive when compared to shark net captures in KwaZulu- Natal, but the lines have shown reduced non-target species bycatch. Drum lines set in the region are baited with 500 grams of meat per hook and are believed to only attract sharks from several hundred metres away. Seasonal and temporary bathing bans and \\"discretionary bathing\\" are additional strategies employed in the region. Bans often follow net displacement or damage due to storms or swell, or net removal due to whale stranding. Nets are also removed during the annual sardine run to limit the degree of bycatch during the event. Pressure from the tourism industry to reinstate nets during the sardine run has previously proven \\"disastrous\\", resulting in large numbers of shark and dolphin mortalities. The \\"shark control\\" program in KwaZulu-Natal has been called \\"archaic\\" and \\"disastrous to the ecosystem\\" (by environmentalists). In a 30-year period, more than 33,000 sharks have been killed in KwaZulu-Natal's shark-killing program ‚Äî also during this period, 2,211 turtles, 8,448 rays, and 2,310 dolphins were killed. Environmental groups say KwaZulu-Natal's \\"shark control\\" program is unethical and harms the marine ecosystem.

Retrieved November 30, 2018. = USA = In Hawaii, seven short term shark culls utilising long-lines took place between 1959 and 1976. During this time, 4,668 sharks were caught, at a cost of US$300,000. Although the Hawaiian resident and tourist human population increased dramatically, the number of shark attacks remained constant (in contrast to Florida, where the number of shark attacks has increased in line with human population increases) and the short term programs were not considered a success by the authors of a shark culling study. The study concluded that the culls \\"do not appear to have had measurable effects on the rate of shark attacks in Hawaiian waters\\". The publication came at a time during intense community debate over culling in Hawaii, documented by local journalist Jim Borg in his 1993 book, Tigers of the Sea, Hawaii‚Äôs Deadly Tiger Sharks.(Mutual Publishing, ) Borg detailed the debates between the study's authors and other scientists who argued that the experiences of South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal Shark BoardSee footnote 35 demonstrated the effectiveness of the culling. The debate began with the November 1991 shark attack killing of Martha Morrell off Maui and embroiled the subsequently formed Hawaii Shark Task Force, Borg writes. Statistics from 2013 showed the number of shark attacks in Hawaii was spiking. = Brazil = A sign warns of elevated shark attack risk at a beach in Recife, Brazil. Drumlines and long lines have been used successfully in Recife in a long term program, where shark attacks have been reduced by around 97%. Sharks are initially caught on baited drum lines. Once captured, the sharks (if found alive) are humanely handled and tagged. They are then relocated offshore and their movements are tracked. The project is known as the Shark Monitoring Program of Recife (SMPR). A report assessing the program's performance was published in 2013. It stated: \\"Overall, the SMPR seems to be less detrimental than shark meshing strategies while clearly contributing for enhancing bather safety; thus, it may provide an effective, ecologically balanced tool for assisting in shark attack mitigation.\\" = R√©union Island (France) = The prevalence of shark attacks at R√©union Island‚Äîthere were 19 attacks between 2011 and 2016, including seven which were fatal‚Äîprompted R√©union island's government to carry out a range of systematic long term shark protection activities, including a shark cull, utilising \\"smart\\" drumlines and longlines. In the five years to August 2016, more than 170 sharks were killed as part of the cull. In 2015, two shark-proof fences were strung at beaches to the west of the island, at a cost of ‚Ç¨2 million. Maintenance of the fences is projected to cost ‚Ç¨1 million a year. The protective nets / shark enclosures at the two beaches have a total length of just under 1 mile and are subject to damage from heavy swell. On 27 August 2016 a surfer lost an arm and a foot from a shark attack while surfing within one of the enclosures. It was reported that at the time of the attack there was a two-meter hole in the nets, most probably caused by the swell.

Although the ‚ÄúBig Four‚Äù remain the most elite, other cities have developed into smaller fashion centers. The history of fashion in Barcelona begins in the early 20th century with the rise of the textile industry and spans through today with its current concentration on fast fashion. With various popular fashion districts and a handful of notable fashion events each year, Barcelona has proved itself as a major city for fashion. According to the Global Language Monitor, which ranks world fashion capitals, Barcelona ranks as #5.  History of fashion in Barcelona  = Early 20th century = The beginning of Barcelona as a capital for fashion can be traced back to the beginning of the 20th century when Barcelona's prosperous textile industry allowed the city's designers to produce some of the finest garments of the day. Various designers contributed to Barcelona's rise as a fashion capital including French haute couture designer Jeanne Lanvin who first learned the art of dressmaking in the Catalan capital city. Later, in 1929, she opened a branch of her store in Barcelona, demonstrating her belief that Barcelona was a meaningful fashion city. Another notable development for fashion in Barcelona came with Pedro Rodriguez who opened his first store, a Parisian-style salon, in Barcelona in 1919. Further, one of the most important events of the early 20th century in relation to Barcelona's growth as a fashion capital includes the Barcelona International Exposition of 1929 where the world-famous designer Crist√≥bal Balenciaga first established himself. Rodriguez and Balenciaga would continue to become the leading Spanish fashion designers of their time. Additionally, in the 1920s multiple textile warehouses emerged including , El Dique Flotante and La f√≠sica, offering haute couture pieces. The combination of Barcelona's link to Paris, the strong Catalan textile industry, and the local embroidery industries lent to Barcelona's emergence as a noteworthy city of fashion. = Mid 20th century = During the Second Republic (1931-1936), Barcelona hosted several fashion shows, but the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) stopped all fashion development in Barcelona. After the war, the growth of the fashion industry resumed. In the 1940s the ‚ÄúCinco Grandes‚Äù (Pedro Rodriguez, Manuel Pertegaz, Asunci√≥n Bastida, Santa Eulalia and El Dique Flotante) appeared in the world of fashion. This group was able to gain support from Francisco Franco‚Äôs military dictatorship that was interested in Spanish exports. This allowed Catalan fashion to continue to develop. = Late 20th century = In 1963, Spanish textile manufacturers and clothing companies created the Moda del Sol union under the leadership of designer Jos√© Mar√≠a Fillol in order to present new, innovative textiles in the form of clothing. From 1967 to 1974, Vogue devoted 17 pages to Moda del Sol twice per year, helping Catalan designers to become internationally recognized. In line with the style of ‚ÄúModa del Sol‚Äù came the rise of pr√™t-√†-porter, or ready-to-wear, fashion in the place of haute couture during the 1960s. Early designers who took part in this initiative in Barcelona include Santa Eul√†lia, Sant Patrick, Margarita Nuez, and Marisol Bofill. Notable pr√™t-√†-porter designers of the 1970s include Toni Mir√≥ and Antonio Balado. The end of 20th century brought the beginning of various fast fashion chains. Fast fashion refers to designs that quickly move from the runway to stores at affordable prices. The first Zara opened in La Coru√±a, Galicia, Spain (under the name of ‚ÄúZorba‚Äù) in 1975 and expanded throughout Spain until its first international store opened in Porto, Portugal in 1988. In the 1990s, Zara's parent company, Inditex, bought Barcelona brands Massimo Dutti and Stradivarius. Additionally, Barcelona-born Mango opened its first store on Passeig de Gr√†cia in 1984. Throughout the end of the century, Barcelona continued to grow as a fashion capital and various fashion franchises continued to open stores in the Catalan capital city. = 21st century = In the 21st century, Barcelona has emerged as one of the top 10 fashion capitals in the world, ranking as #5 in 2015 according to the Global Language Monitor. In 2014, the region in which Barcelona is located, Catalonia, was home to 1,700 fashion businesses that employed 100,000 people and generated 13 billion euros (about US$13.8 billion) per year.  Barcelona fashion districts  = Passeig de Gr√†cia = This neighborhood is Barcelona's most posh fashion district that offers luxury brands including Chanel, Valentino, Hermes, and Burberry. It also includes the mass-market stores such as Zara, Mango, H&M;, and Desigual. Additionally, the Spanish luxury label, Loewe, can also be found in Passeig de Gr√†cia. With ornate buildings designed by the famous modernist artists Antoni Gaud√≠, Josep Puig i Cadafalch, and Llu√≠s Dom√®nech i Montaner lining the streets of Passeig de Gr√†cia, tourists and locals alike can enjoy shopping near Barcelona's most iconic architecture. = Portal de L‚ÄôAngel = Located off of Pla√ßa de Catalunya, Portal de L‚ÄôAngel is the second largest shopping district, after Passeig de Gr√†cia, and provides shoppers with a large number of department stores. El Corte Ingl√©s, Zara, Bershka, Pull&Bear;, Mango, and other fashion franchises can be found here. = La Rambla de Catalunya = This fashion avenue runs parallel with Passeig de Gr√†cia and offers a more unique set of options. La Rambla is home to primarily independent stores and can be described as more ‚Äúbourgeois‚Äù than Passeig de Gr√†cia. With a rich history as Barcelona's largest area for markets, La Rambla is a place where shopping meets culture and shoppers can feel Barcelona's old charm and new style. However, watch out for pickpockets. La Rambla is known as the number one place for pickpockets in the world.  Barcelona fashion events  = 080 Barcelona = 080 Barcelona is Barcelona's bi-annual Fashion Week in which designers display their most recent collections to the public. Over the course of five days, there are 40 fashion parades that give both buyers and the general public the opportunity to see the latest trends. Currently, internationalization is at the focus of the event in order to present local designers to the world and to ensure Barcelona remains a top city for fashion. 080 gives Barcelona the opportunity to show its culture of fashion to the world. = TSNB Barcelona = The Shopping Night Barcelona (TSNB), founded in 2010, offers shoppers the opportunity to stay out until 1:00am to shop in the Passeig de Gr√†cia neighborhood at the beginning of December. Many stores offer promotions and sales aimed at attracting holiday shoppers. Additionally, traffic is blocked off so that shoppers can easily move through the streets, enjoying the stores as well as the festive events such as street food booths, local concerts, and other performances. In 2015, TSNB brought 85,000 shoppers to Passeig de Gr√†cia. = Barcelona Fashion Summit = Founded in 2013, Barcelona Fashion Summit offers an annual meeting point that brings together Spanish fashion executives to learn and discuss trends in the industry. The forum offers important information regarding how companies can grow and succeed in the world of fashion. Regarded as the leading event for fashion professionals in Barcelona, Barcelona Fashion Summit provides attendees with conferences, round tables, and networking events crucial for those that want to advance in the industry.  Fashion brands from Barcelona  Barcelona's long history of innovation lends itself to a wide selection of Barcelona-born fashion brands. From the Mango of 1984 to the more recent Bimba Lola of 2006, Barcelona is a city that breeds design. *Grupo Cortefiel *Bimba Lola *Lottusse *Loewe *Massimo Dutti *Mango *Tous *Ailanto *Sita Murt *Lupo Barcelona *Great Tomorrow Clothing *Desigual References Barcelona Spanish fashion History of fashion ","title":"Fashion in Barcelona"},{"id":"52584899","text":"The Eccentrics (, Sherekilebi; , Chudaki) is a 1973 Soviet Satire-Comedy film directed by Eldar Shengelaya.http://www.geocinema.ge/en/index.php?filmi=258 Cast *Vasili Chkhaidze as Qristepore *Demno Jgenti as Ertaozi *Ariadna Shengelaia as Margalita *Boris Tsipuria as Khuta, a policeman *Abrek Pkhaladze as Noshrevani *Merab Eliozishvili as Triponi *Akaki Bakradze as Mizana *Grigol Tkabladze as Priest References External links * 1973 films Soviet films 1973 comedy-drama films Soviet comedy- drama films Georgian-language films Kartuli Pilmi films Films directed by Eldar Shengelaia Soviet-era films from Georgia (country) Films from Georgia (country) Russian satirical films 1970s satirical films ","title":"The Eccentrics"},{"id":"52584910","text":"Nikola Panayot Pavletich is the chair of structural biology at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.

It authorized $6.3 billion in funding, mostly for the National Institutes of Health. The act was supported especially by large pharmaceutical manufacturers and was opposed especially by some consumer organizations. Proponents said that it would streamline the drug and device approval process and bring treatments to market faster. Opponents said that it would allow drugs and devices to be approved on weaker evidence, bypassing randomized, controlled trials, and bring more dangerous or ineffective treatments to market.With media watchdogs on the sidelines, pharma-funded advocacy groups pushed Cures Act to the finish line. Trudy Lieberman, HealthNewsReview, December 6, 2016 The bill incorporated the Helping Families In Mental Health Crisis Act, first introduced by then- Congressman Tim Murphy, R-Pa., which increased the availability of psychiatric hospital beds and established a new assistant secretary for mental health and substance use disorders.Congress Is on the Verge of Passing a Landmark Mental Health BillHouse Passes Most Significant Mental Health Reform Bill in Decades  Content  = The Small Business HRA (QSEHRA) = The 21st Century Cures Act also included provisions that would benefit small businesses and their employees' health benefits. The law created what is called a QSEHRA, a more efficient way for small businesses and non-profits to offer health insurance to their employees. To cut quickly through the insurance jargon (it stands for ‚ÄúQualified Small Employer Health Reimbursement Arrangement\\"), a QSEHRA allows small employers to set aside a fixed amount of money each month that employees can use to purchase individual health insurance or use on medical expenses, tax-free. This means employers get to offer benefits in a tax-efficient manner without the hassle or headache of administering a traditional group plan and employees can choose the plan they want. = Research and drug development = Division A, which shares the title ‚Äú21st Century Cures Act,‚Äù contains provisions related to National Institutes of Health funding and administration, reducing opioid abuse, medical research, and drug development. Division A‚Äî21st Century Cures  Opioid epidemic  The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) was passed a few months earlier. This act authorized many harm-reduction strategies, including increased access to the overdose reversal drug naloxone, for the opioid crisis, but didn't provide any federal funding for implementation. The 21st Century Cures Act designated $1 billion in grants for states over two years to fight the opioid epidemic. The money may be used to improve prescription drug monitoring programs, to make treatment programs more accessible, to train healthcare professionals in best practices of addiction treatment, and to research the most effective approaches to prevent dependency.  FDA drug approval process  The 21st Century Cures Act modified the FDA Drug Approval process. It was intended to expedite the process by which new drugs and devices are approved by easing the requirements put on drug companies looking for FDA approval on new products or new indications on existing drugs. For instance, under certain conditions, the act allows companies to provide \\"data summaries\\" and \\"real world evidence\\" such as observational studies, insurance claims data, patient input, and anecdotal data rather than full clinical trial results.  Targeted drugs for rare diseases  The 21st Century Cures Act facilitates development and approval of genetically targeted and variant protein targeted drugs for treatment of rare diseases.https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-114publ255/pdf/PLAW-114publ255.pdf  Informed consent  In section 3024, the 21st Century Cures Act allows researchers to waive the requirement for \\"informed consent\\" in cases where clinical testing of drugs or devices \\"poses no more than minimal risk\\" and \\"includes appropriate safeguards to protect the rights, safety, and welfare of the human subject.\\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-114publ255/pdf/PLAW-114publ255.pdf An example that has been given is a high-tech bandage that monitors blood flow from a serious wound, which functions just like a regular bandage but only has this added benefit of possibly monitoring blood flow. Ordinarily, researchers would obtain the patient's permission before testing any new device on them. However, in this example, researchers might want to test the bandage in a real-world scenario where patients may not be conscious. In such circumstances, researchers may waive an informed consent requirement, since it would be difficult or impossible to obtain, and the patient is still getting the standard, medically accepted care of blood pressure and heart rate monitoring. Researchers will still need to obey standard research protocols including institutional review boards to approve their research design and ethics.  Human research subject protections  The 21st Century Cures Act calls on the Secretary of Health and Human Services to harmonize differences between the HHS Human Subject Regulations and FDA Human Subject Regulations. In so doing, the Secretary may change rules applying to vulnerable populations in order \\"to reduce regulatory duplication and unnecessary delays\\" and \\"modernize such provisions in the context of multisite and cooperative research projects.\\" Section 3023 provides for joint or shared review of research, review by institutional review boards other than that of the sponsor of research, and use of other means \\"to avoid duplication of effort.\\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-114publ255/pdf/PLAW-114publ255.pdf  Medical research  The act allocates $4.8 billion to the National Institutes of Health for precision medicine and biomedical research. Of this, $1.5 billion is earmarked for research on brain disease. Another $1.8 billion is dedicated to cancer research in what is called the \\"Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot\\" initiative, named in honor of Vice President Joe Biden's son, who died of brain cancer in 2015.  Strategic Petroleum Reserve sales  The act requires sale of 25 million barrels of crude oil (10,000,000 in 2017, 9,000,000 in 2018, and 6,000,000 in 2019) from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve., Sec. 5010. Strategic Petroleum Reserve Drawdown. Revenue from these sales will provide part of the NIH funding provided in the law. = Behavioral health = Division B of the law, the ‚ÄúHelping Families in Mental Health Crisis Reform Act of 2016,‚Äù addresses the prevention and treatment of mental illnesses and substance abuse, treatment coverage, communication permitted by HIPAA, and interactions with law enforcement and the criminal justice system. Division B‚ÄîHelping Families in Mental Health Crisis The law strengthens mental health parity regulation, which require insurance companies to cover mental health treatments to the same extent and in the same way as medical treatments. It also includes grants to provide community mental health resources, suicide prevention and intervention programs, and de-escalation training for law enforcement. It also provides five-year grants for a demonstration program in which psychiatry residents and other mental health clinicians will practice in underserved areas. Provisions for reform of HIPAA, elevating the standing of families in commitment decisions, and reforms of procedures for challenging release decisions, were not included in the final bill. Some of these provisions were originally proposed in earlier bills, including the Mental Health Reform Act of 2016 (); the Mental Health and Safe Communities Act of 2015 (, ); the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act of 2016 (); the Comprehensive Justice and Mental Health Act of 2015 (, ); the Mental Health Awareness and Improvement Act of 2015 (, ); the Justice and Mental Health Collaboration Act of 2015 (); and the Behavioral Health Care Integration Act of 2016 (). = Healthcare access and quality improvement = Division C of the law, the ‚ÄúIncreasing Choice, Access, and Quality in Health Care for Americans Act,‚Äù concerns Medicare programs and federal tax laws related to health plans for small employers.

It passed the House on July 10, 2015. but in the Senate, it died in committee. More than 1,400 registered lobbyists worked on this bill, representing more than 400 different organizations, mostly pharmaceutical companies. Of 455 organizations registered to lobby on the bill, the top five by number of reports and specific issues according to OpenSecrets were: * Roche Holdings (61) * Blue Cross Blue Shield (49) * Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America PhRMA (49) * Amgen (41) * American Hospital Association (36). The bill passed the House first by a wide margin. Only five senators voted against it: Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, both of Oregon, all Democrats, and Mike Lee, a Republican of Utah. Warren, Sanders and Merkley, in particular, objected to the pharmaceutical industry's influence on the bill. In early December 2016, the act had support from both houses of congress. President Obama signed the act on December 13, 2016. The reasons stated for his support included counting opioid abuse, advancing cancer research, advancing the BRAIN Initiative, advancing the Precision Medicine Initiative, and addressing bipartisan health issues. Reception Stakeholders who praised the passing of the act include drug companies; medical device manufacturers; the National Institutes of Health; people advocating for lowered barriers to collecting human subject research data; Representatives Fred Upton (R-MI), Diana DeGette (D-CO), Timothy F. Murphy (R-PA); Senator Lamar Alexander (R-TN); and Vice President Joe Biden. Hospitals and universities, as well as the American Cancer Society Action Network, Research!America, and FasterCures supported the bill for its commitment toward funding research. The American Psychological Association supported the bill due to its mental health provisions. The Advanced Medical Technology Association supported the bill for easing the process of introducing new medical technologies. The American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) commended the passage of the bill for strengthened genetic privacy for research participants. Prison Fellowship supported the bill due to its inclusion of the Comprehensive Justice and Mental Health Act, a portion designed to encourage collaboration among criminal justice, juvenile justice, mental health treatment, and substance abuse systems. Stakeholders who criticized the passing of the act include the FDA, advocates for strong protections in clinical research, consumer organizations, and advocates of regenerative medicine. The expedited drug approval process has been one topic of concern and debate The Public Citizen‚Äôs Health Research Group and the National Center for Health Research campaigned against the Cures Act in fear that it will endanger public health by weakening FDA standards. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that the bill had been ‚Äúhijacked‚Äù by the pharmaceutical industry. She said the legislation watered down safety requirements for new drugs and devices and then, as a trade-off, called for research funding ‚Äî at levels that must be appropriated on an annual basis. John LaMattina, former head of Pfizer research and development and current commentator on the pharmaceutical industry, said that full clinical trials are necessary to prove effectiveness, and suggests some drugs may now be approved based on early data and only later proved ineffective. The Public Citizen's Health Research Group says the designation of ‚Äúbreakthrough‚Äù devices is too broad, and could lead to clearance of devices that aren't ready for the market. Lupkin points out that the NIH's funding will need to be appropriated each year through the normal budget process, and therefore may be reduced from what this bill promised. The NIH funding was actually less than many advocates hoped for, and earlier versions of the bill had promised. One of the goals of the bill was streamlining approval, but Jerry Avorn and Aaron Kesselheim pointed out that a third of medicines are approved from a single clinical trial averaging less than 700 patients; ultimately, however, the law did not allow real-world evidence for approving drugs, but rather for label expansions.

It protects one of the last remnants of seasonal deciduous forest in the state on the shore of the reservoir of the It√° Hydroelectric Power Plant. Location The Fritz Plaumann State Park is in the municipality of Conc√≥rdia in the west of Santa Catarina. It has an area of . It is named after a German scientist who lived in the region. Fritz Plaumann (1902‚Äì94) gathered more than 80,000 specimens of insects during his long career, now exhibited at the Fritz Plaumann Entomological Museum (Museu Entomol√≥gico Fritz Plaumann) in Seara. The collection is the largest in Latin America and one of the largest in the world. The park is on the north shore of the lake formed by the dam of the It√° Hydroelectric Power Plant on the Uruguay River, built between 1990 and 2000. About 1/3 of the park is an island in the reservoir. The Queimados River rises above the city of Conc√≥rdia and its flooded mouth on the Uruguay River forms the western boundary of the park. The park contains the Lajeado Cruzeiro, a watercourse that has its sources around the park and its mouth near the flooded area of the Queimados River. The park's buffer zone is a strip around the park, extending to include small hydrographic basins that drain into the park. There are about 70 farms in the buffer zone growing various crops and raising dairy cattle, pigs, poultry and sheep. History Studies for implementation of conservation units to compensate for areas flooded by the It√° Dam began in 1990, and in 1994 an ecological station was defined with two parts, one in Santa Catarina and the other in Rio Grande do Sul. In 1996 the portion in Rio Grande do Sul was recategorized as the Teixeira Soares Municipal Nature Park, while the Santa Catarina portion remained an ecological station. Between 2000 and 2001 the management plan was prepared for what would be the Barra do Queimados Ecological Station. In 2003 public consultation were held on changing the management category and the name. The Fritz Plaumann State Park was created by state decree 797 of 24 September 2003, the first and only conservation unit protected seasonal deciduous forest in the State of Santa Catarina. It was created as environmental compensation for the It√° Hydroelectric Power Plant. The objective is to conserve and restore biodiversity of the Uruguay River Forest by generating and socializing knowledge and experience. Land ownership has been fully regularized. The park has received various prizes for its environmental management work. The ecological station management plan was revised and adapted in 2003 to 2004 to fit the state park category. The management plan was approved by FATMA ordinance 082/05 of 13 October 2005. The park was opened to the public in November 2007. A revised management plan was approved in November 2014. The park is managed by the Fritz Plaumann State Park Co-Management Team (ECOPEF), a civil society organization created in 2007, in cooperation with FATMA, the Santa Catarina environmental agency. Environment View from a trail in the park The park fully protects a remnant of Uruguay River Forest, a seasonal deciduous forest. The forest has typical plant species such as canaf√≠stula (Pelthoporum dubium), gr√°pia (Apuleia leocarpa), cedar (Cedrela fissilis) and angico-vermelho (Parapiptadenia rigida). Many of the species of fauna in the park are threatened by hunting and deforestation. They include the tufted capuchin (Sapajus apella), lowland paca (Cuniculus paca), southern tamandua (Tamandua tetradactyla), red brocket (Mazama americana), Azara's agouti (Dasyprocta azarae), dusky-legged guan (Penelope obscura), the frog Vitreorana uranoscopa and snakes such as Bothrops neuwiedi and Spilotes pullatus. The main threats to the environment of the park are invasive forest species such as Hovenia dulcis and Hedychium coronarium, pollution from waste dumped into the Queimados River, and predatory hunting and fishing in and around the park. Facilities As of 2016 the park was open to the public on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays from 14:00 to 17:00, on Saturday from 9:00 to 17:00 and on Sunday from 13:00 to 18:00. The visitor center has an exhibition room with a model and multi-themed panels on the nature and biodiversity of the area. It also contains a study hall, auditorium and housing for researchers. Several trails start from the visitor center. The Marrequinhas Trail is wheelchair accessible, with a theme of reservoir ecology, rivers and ecological relations in a fluvial environment. The Lajeado Cruzeiro Trail takes one hour and a half for a guided walk, and has a theme of water resources and pollution problems. The Mirante (Lookout) Trail is of moderate difficulty and takes two hours. Its theme is understanding of the hydrographic basins and the transformation of the landscape by human activity. The Canaf√≠stula Trail is moderate to difficult and takes two hours. Small groups are given guided tours. The theme is basic concepts of ecology and biodiversity of the Uruguay River Forest.

The village, long the town's commercial heart, has a well-preserved array of 19th and early-20th century architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. Description and history The village of Jeffersonville occupies fertile bottomlands between the Lamoille River, which flows roughly southwest at that point, and the Brewster River, a tributary which flows north into the Lamoille. The village arose in the early 19th century because the Brewster River was well suited to provide water power to industry. Its earliest settler, John Brewster, arrived in the 1780s, and the village was incorporated in 1827. Its 19th-century growth resulted in a significant number of Greek Revival houses. Around the turn of the 20th century the village gained a number of fine Victorian and Colonial Revival buildings. with The historic district is roughly L-shaped, extending west along Church Street and north along Main Street from their meeting point. Maple Street parallels Main Street to the west, and School Street loops off Main Street to the east, providing a simple grid. Most of the district's 67 building are historic in character, and are in a wide variety of styles popular in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The only brick buildings in the district are a church, store, and school buildings. Most buildings are 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 stories in height, and their styling is typically vernacular.

He ruled the lordship during his father's absence on the Fourth Crusade and his long captivity. Renard died before his father and never succeeded to the lordship in full. Renard was the eldest son of Renard II and Helvide. He and his brother Anselm were both born before 1192, when they are mentioned in a document for the first time. They are also mentioned in documents of 1193 and 1196. Renard II left on crusade in 1202, was captured and did not return to Astenois until 1233. In 1207 and in May 1218, Renard, as acting suzerain, confirmed two donations made by his uncle Henry. Renard himself many several grants, always respecting his father's right to confirm or revoke them if and when he returned from captivity overseas. The grant of the tithes and revenues from the fairs of Le Vieil-Dampierre to the abbey of Chatrices was confirmed by his father and ratified by Count Theobald IV of Champagne, their suzerain, in 1234. In 1218, Renard III, calling himself \\"Jerusalem bound\\" (Hierosolimam profecturus), granted the tithes of Remicourt and the produce (terrage) of Sommeille to the abbey of Monthiers-en-Argonne, specifying that if his father did not approve these gifts, then the Countess Blanche, who confirmed the grant, could make good on the gift out of her own lands. Renard's wife, Beatrice, lady of Til-Ch√¢tel, is first mentioned in a charter of 1221. In another charter that year, Renard used the title \\"count\\" for the first time. There is no surviving documentation between this and a charter of 1224. If Renard did go on his long-planned pilgrimage or crusade to the Holy Land, it should probably be dated to this interval. Renard's last known act is dated to 1230 and died not long after. Renard had many children, but only one, Renard IV, is known by name. Although a minor, he succeeded to the acting lordship under the regency of his uncle Anselm, until the return of Renard II in 1233. Renard IV seems to have died before his grandfather, who was thus succeeded by Anselm in 1234. His widow, Beatrice, married Walter II, lord of Arzilli√®res.

Along with the southern pygmy (D. wrighti) and the seepage salamander (D. aeneus), these are some of the smallest salamander species in North America and can be found in higher elevations in the southern Appalachians. Description Desmognathus organi can be identified by its small size, averaging only 40‚Äì60 mm total length, and its distinct herringbone pattern on the dorsal side and copper colored eyelids, which are traits only shared with D. wrighti. Dorsal coloration can vary from dark reddish-brown to light brown, with a much lighter ventral surface. Characteristic of the Desmognathus species, there is a light colored eye stripe to the jaw, and the hindlimbs are longer and more robust than the forelimbs. However, unlike most of the other Desmognathus species, the tail is round in cross section and is also less than half of the total length of the salamander, this seems to be characteristic of these smaller species, including the southern pygmy (D. wrighti) and seepage salamander (D. aeneus). In contrast to D. wrighti, D. organi salamanders are generally slightly larger in size, with the maximum total length of adult D. wrighti being 50 mm whereas most adult D. organi exceed 50 mm. They also have wider heads than D. wrighti, and D. organi females tend to be larger than males. This sexual dimorphism is absent in D. wrighti. Geographic distribution Populations of Desmognathus organi can be found in high elevation spruce-fir and hardwood forest habitats in the Blue Ridge Mountains. It is rare to find this species below 1500m. It is thought that historically the distribution of spruce-fir forests and subsequent populations of pygmy salamanders may have been continuous at one point, but as the climate became warmer and drier populations became isolated on the high elevation \\"islands\\" that we see today. This species occurs north and east of the French Broad river, ranging from the southwesternmost part of Virginia, particularly Mount Rogers and Whitetop Mountain, to the ridges of western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee. Its sister species, D. wrighti, occurs at similar elevations and habitats south and west of the French Broad to the Georgia state line. Life history Desmognathus organi undergoes direct development to bypass the aquatic larval stage. This is a unique trait of D. organi and the other small Desmognathus species D. wrighti and D. aeneus, allowing them to be the most terrestrial species of the genus. Most Desmognathus species rely on a water source to lay their eggs and mature in the water for the first stage of their lives, but by hatching as small adult salamanders, D. organi can survive in wooded areas away from streams. D. organi have been reported climbing trees as high as 2 meters off the ground, and this is believed to be a method for catching prey or escaping predation. Males reach reproductive maturity by 3.5 yrs old, and females mature by 4.5. Mating occurs in fall and spring, and involves the males biting on to the female's tail to initiate the mating process. In a typical Plethodontidae mating behaviour, the pair will then walk in a line with the female straddling the male's tail and the male will then deposit a spermatophore on the ground and guide the female to it so she may pick it up with her cloaca. This is how they achieve internal fertilization, and the female will lay a clutch averaging 3-10 eggs in a seepage area or wherever she can find moist ground and stay nearby to protect them. Finding a moist place to lay the eggs is only necessary so the eggs do not dry out, as once the eggs hatch the hatchlings will not live in water. D. organi can be found mostly on the forest floor under moss, leaf litter, fallen logs, or small stones. It has been observed that they seem to prefer smaller covers of woody debris rather larger covers, such as big rocks. D. organi will overwinter in clusters underground in seepage areas, often communally. In 1959, James Organ uncovered as many as 649 individuals from a single nesting/hibernating site in a seep. During spring through fall, D. organi will be mostly active at night and when it rains, and will hunt small invertebrates such as mites, moths, small beetles, and spiders. Predators of D. organi may include the spring salamander (Gyrinophilus porphyriticus), larger Desmognathus species such as the blackbellied salamander (D. quadromaculatus), small snakes like the ringneck (Diadophis punctatus), carabid beetles, and birds. Conservation status Currently, Desmognathus organi has not been assessed by the IUCN, but Desmognathus wrighti (which previously encompassed Northern and Southern pygmy populations) has been classified as Least Concern nationally, but was deemed in need of management in Tennessee in 2011. Further assessment of the species is still needed. The species could face habitat loss due to logging, increased recreation in the Pisgah and Cherokee National Forests, and habitat alteration resulting from climate change and acid rain in some areas.

He is director of the Telethon Institute of Genetics and Medicine (TIGEM) of Pozzuoli; Professor of Medical Genetics at the Federico II University of Naples and Visiting Professor of Genetics at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, USA and at the University of Oxford-UK. Early life and education After graduating in medicine and specializing in pediatrics at the Federico II University in Naples, he spent many years abroad, first in England and then in the United States, where he became associate professor at the Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine and co-director of Baylor Human Genome Center in Houston, Texas. In 1994 he returned to Italy where he founded TIGEM, of which he is the Scientific Director. TIGEM is a research institute of excellence in Italy, with about 220 researchers from all over the world. Along with his team of researchers, he has identified genetic mutations responsible for many rare genetic diseases. His discovery of the TFEB gene, which controls the functioning of lysosomes, has had a major impact on cellular biology and neurodegenerative diseases. Career At the beginning of his research career, he focused his attention on gene-disease identification including: the Kallmann syndrome gene (involved in axonal orientation), the OA1 gene (which deals withmelanosomes biogenesis and is mutated in ocular albinism), the paraplegine gene (which is involved in mitochondrial biology and mutated in hereditary spastic paraplegia), the MID1 gene (which is involved in the development of the median line and mutated in the OBB Opitz syndrome). He then focused on identifying the mechanisms underlying rare genetic diseases, particularly regarding lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs). In this context, he made the discovery of the Multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD), in which all members of the sulphatase family (17 in humans) are deficient due to a defect in a post-translational modification. Using an innovative approach, he identified the SUMF1 (Modification Factor 1 sulphatase) gene, which is responsible for this post-translational modification and is mutated in MSD patients. It has also been shown that the overexpression of SUMF1 significantly increases the activity of exogenous sulphatase in both in vitro and in vivo models. This discovery had immediate clinical application: the SUMF1 gene is currently in use in the production of sulphatase as a tool to improve sulphatase activity for enzymatic replacement therapy. More recently he focused his attention on lysosomes, the organelles that are responsible for cellular waste degradation. Challenging the conventional knowledge of cellular biology, he hypothesized that lysosome is a dynamic structure subjected to global transcriptional regulation and able to adapt to environmental stimuli. Together with his team, he discovered that lysosomal, autophagy, and exocytotic biosynthesis are transcriptionally regulated by a gene network and controlled by the TFEB master gene, that promote cellular clearance. This mechanism has been tested in various disease models including: Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, Huntington's disease, lysosomal storage disorders, the Œ±1-anti- trypsin deficiency and the bulbous spinal muscular atrophy. This discovery has opened up new possible therapeutic strategies based on the possibility of globally modulating lysosomal function by acting on TFEB gene network.

Sherman (April 2, 1953 ‚Äì December 9, 2016) was an American political activist, perennial candidate, and businessman. He was known for his role as an Illinois Green Party candidate and for his atheist advocacy. He died in a plane crash outside Marengo, Illinois on December 9, 2016 at the age of 63. Biography =Early life= Sherman was born and raised a Jew. He stated that he was an atheist since age 9, and that \\"it became a big deal\\" when he was 13. He spent his adolescence in Highland Park, and according to a candidate questionnaire, he attended National Louis University, Northwestern University, and Harper College. He worked as an office supply dealer. =Atheist advocacy= In 1981, Sherman listened to a radio speech by Madalyn Murray O'Hair, an activist and founder of American Atheists. The speech motivated him to join the organization, and he eventually became its Illinois director and national spokesman. He first achieved notoriety on April 1, 1986, when he sued the village of Zion, Illinois for displaying a Christian cross on a water tower, as well as other property. The case eventually went to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1992, which ruled in Sherman's favor and ordered municipalities to drop the use of religious symbols. His success earned him front-page news coverage and invites to appear on national TV shows, including those of Oprah Winfrey, Phil Donahue and Larry King. Sherman frequently received attention in the 1980s and 1990s due to his atheism activism. He filed lawsuits against numerous American municipalities, against the Boy Scouts of America in 1997, and against Township High School District 214 in 2007 for what he considered unconstitutional endorsements of religion. He was involved in numerous other lawsuits, of which at least one other went to the Supreme Court in the late 2000s. Reporter Richard Roeper said in 1998 that \\"he has battled towns from South Holland to Deerfield to Zion to Palatine to Highland, Ind., and Wauwatosa, Wis., over public displays of religious symbols on water towers, on government property and on official village seals.\\" After 10 years of membership in American Atheists, he formed his own organization, Rob Sherman Advocacy. =Political involvement= In his later years, Sherman was active in politics as a perennial candidate. In 2006, he unsuccessfully ran for the 53rd district in the Illinois House of Representatives as a Democrat. In 2008, after meeting Green Party gubernatorial candidate Rich Whitney, Sherman joined the party. That same year, he ran as a Green for the same seat. He ran unsuccessfully for Buffalo Grove Village Clerk in 2011, for Illinois's 5th congressional district in 2016 as a Green ‚Äì receiving 4.7% of the vote ‚Äì and he had announced that he would run for Illinois's 12th congressional district in 2018. He served as the Cook County Green Party chairman in 2012. Sherman's political positions included support for capitalism, same-sex marriage, and climate change advocacy, and he opposed red light cameras. He also supported secularist views, such as removing mentions of \\"God\\" from United States dollar and the Pledge of Allegiance and removing Christmas as a federal holiday. =Radio and later career= Sherman hosted radio shows on AM 1530 WJJG and WSSY-AM (1330). In the summer of 2016, Sherman moved from Buffalo Grove to Poplar Grove, Illinois, where he started a company that built kit aircraft. Death On the night of December 9, 2016, Sherman died when his Zenair CH 601 Zodiac crashed outside of Marengo, Illinois. He was 63. He was flying from his home in Poplar Grove to Schaumburg Regional Airport to attend a holiday party. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that Sherman's plane lost control soon after taking off, and that it crashed around 6:19 p.m. on December 9. Federal Aviation Administration records also showed that Sherman had a sport pilot certificate, meaning that by flying at night, he was violating the restrictions on his license. Personal life Sherman married his wife, Celeste, in 1978, and together they had a son and a daughter. He lived in Buffalo Grove, Illinois for 32 years before moving to Poplar Grove, Illinois in the summer of 2016. He was a volunteer with the American Red Cross. On June 4, 1998, Sherman was arrested and charged with domestic battery for beating his 16-year-old son with his hands and fists. Police also confiscated Sherman's rifle and semiautomatic handgun. The following month, Sherman was convicted of domestic battery in Cook County Court. The next year, he spent 120 days in prison for failing to follow orders to complete domestic violence counseling.

He dedicated it to the cellist Oskar Br√ºckner who performed it first, with the composer as the pianist, in Wiesbaden on 17 October 1893. It was published by Augener & Co., London, in September 1893.  History  Reger studied at the Wiesbaden Conservatory from 1890 to 1893, composition with Hugo Riemann. Reger composed his first Cello Sonata in F minor in 1892. Riemann got Reger his first publishing contract, with the London house Augener & Co. for seven years. They published the cello sonata in September 1893. Reger dedicated the work to the cellist Oskar Br√ºckner who performed it first, with the composer as the pianist, in Wiesbaden on 17 October 1893.  Music and recordings  The sonata is structured in three movements: * Allegro maestoso ma appasionato * Adagio con gran affetto ‚Äì Pi√π mosso assai * Finale / Allegro (un poco scherzando) The sonata shares characteristics with the works in the genre by Johannes Brahms, in harmony, rhythm, figuration, a rich piano part and passionate cello lines. The opening of the first movement has been described as \\"surging passionately and heroically\\". The second movement in D-flat major begins almost like an operatic scene, with a cello line like recitative. The finale is lively and playful. The musicologist Calum MacDonald writes: \\"Just before the coda there is a moment of quiet reflection that brings home how the opening phrase of the finale theme echoes that of the first movement‚Äôs first subject, before the tumultuous closing bars. In the final cadence the piano alludes to the dotted figure with which the sonata had begun\\". Gavin Dixon notes in a review that \\"intense drama is present from the first note of the First Sonata\\", and summarizes that the cello sonatas are \\"psychologically turbulent\\", complex and traumatic. Recordings have included one by Alexander Kniazev (cello) and √âdouard Oganessian (piano) as part of their recordings of the complete works by Reger for cello and piano. They played the four sonatas in 1997 and the other pieces in 2008 and 2009. Another recording of Reger's cello sonatas and cello suites was made by Alban Gerhardt and in 2007. Reviewer Ivan March notes that \\"both artists produce the passionate response demanded\\", especially Gerhardt's \\"warm, resonant middle register\\" and Becker's ability to meet \\"the music's considerable virtuosity\\".

V·¥á·¥õ·¥á Ä·¥Ä…¥s L·¥Ä·¥°: C·¥Äs·¥ás ·¥Ä…¥·¥Ö T ú·¥á·¥è Ä è 432 (American Casebook Series, West Academic Publishing, 2015). is a United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims case that dealt with the adequacy and weighing of medical opinions.  Background  Angel Nieves- Rodriguez served in the U.S. Army from November 1954 to October 1956. While in the service, he was treated for Guillain-Barre Syndrome. In February 1957, the Veterans Benefits Administration granted service connection and associated disability benefits for this condition. In 1970, Nieves-Rodriguez developed psychological problems and claimed service connection for them. The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) denied service connection, based on a report from a VA examiner that diagnosed an anxiety reaction but did not discuss the etiology of the condition. In 1995 Nieves-Rodriguez was diagnosed with major depression. He filed another disability claim for major depression, as a direct service connected illness, In 1998, VBA denied service connection on both counts. Nieves-Rodriguez then appealed the decision to the Board of Veterans Appeals. Nieves-Rodriguez obtained private medical opinions from two physicians in support of his claim. One doctor submitted a letter stating that he had treated the Veteran since 1995 and opined that his major depression was secondary to the service connected Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome. A second doctor provided an opinion with the same conclusion. This second doctor had the opportunity to review the Veteran's claims folder, but later admitted during a hearing that he had not reviewed the Veteran's medical records that pertained to neurology treatment. Nieves-Rodriguez reported for VA examinations in 2000 and 2004. He met with the same VA examiner on both occasions. The examiner reviewed the entire claims folder and noted that previous VA neurological evaluations indicated that the Veteran exhibited \\"very little and very mild consequences\\" as a result of the Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© Syndrome.Nieves-Rodriguez vs. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 297 (2008). The examiner opined on both occasions that the claimant's major depressive disorder was not caused by Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© Syndrome. The Board placed more probative value on the VA examiner's opinion, reasoning that the private doctors did not conduct an in-depth review of the claims folder, thereby reducing the probative weight of their opinions.  Analysis  The Court started out by rejecting the assumption that a private medical opinion not based on a complete review of the claims folder is always less sufficient than an opinion based on a complete review of the records. The Court supported this statement by noting that \\"[b]oth VA medical examiners and private physicians offering medical opinions in veterans benefits cases are nothing more or less than expert witnesses\\".Id. at 302. The Court, while pointing out that the Board of Veterans Appeals is not bound by the Federal Rules of Evidence, noted that the rules on expert witness testimony are useful in determining probative value as it pertains to medical opinions. Specifically, the Court laid out this framework, from the Federal Rules of Evidence,F·¥á·¥Ö. R. E·¥†…™·¥Ö. 702 as a guide: # The testimony is based on sufficient facts or data, # The testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods, and # The expert witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case. The Court then applied this framework to the medical opinions provided by the doctors. The Court held that a claims file review is not a mandatory requirement for private medical opinions, reasoning that the expert witness could nevertheless be informed of the sufficient facts or data, e.g., because the doctor had been treating the veteran for the illness in question. In applying this framework to the present case, the Court accepted the fact that the Board discounted the opinion provided by the second doctor, as the doctor had overlooked key information in the claims folder. However, the Court stated that the Board had not provided sufficient reasons and bases to explain why it had discounted the first doctor's medical opinion, noting that the Board discounted the doctor's opinion merely because the doctor did not state that he or she had reviewed the claims folder.  Decision  The Court vacated the BVA decision and remanded the case back to the Board of Veterans Appeals for readjudication consistent with the Court's opinion.

Biography  Nathalie Colin was born on April 17, 1966, in the East of France in the small town of Cornimont (Vosges, 88). Both parents work in the textile industry, and inspire her interest for fashion, from an early age. She loved to cut out dresses for her dolls, in the fabric swatches that her father brought home. She learned how to draw, thanks to her mother's skills. At the age of 14, she founded a fine art group, organized art exhibitions, and always volunteered to take the lead to perform lead role in acting classes, and in creative projects. After her Baccalaur√©at Mathematics & Physics, she joined the Hypokagne class at Lycee Henri Poincar√© in Nancy. She then graduated from the Institut de Commerce de Nancy, a higher business education based on a unique creative concept based on the moto ‚Äúcreative thinking makes the difference‚Äù. She pursued trainings at Benetton in Paris and Boston (US) and decided to complete her education with a complementary education program at the well-known Fashion Institute of Technology in NYC. During that time, she worked for Perry Ellis in NYC in the merchandising department, where she learned from Marc Jacobs, the current creative director. Back to Paris in 1990, she started to work as Marketing Director for Promostyl, a trend-forecasting agency, and traveled extensively the world to consult international brands in the luxury, beauty, fashion, accessories, & electronic fields. In 1998 she founded her own creative agency Cultural Sushi, a design agency specialized in cross-cultural creative projects across Europe and Asia. In 1999 & 2000 she relocated to Beijing, China, to start an apparel brand with Olivier Lapidus for a Chinese company (Yimian Group).

Her first creative contribution to the jewelry market was to impose color in the mainly transparent world of crystals. Nathalie Colin also always stood for the internationalization of her Swarovski team to maximize inspirations: ‚ÄúSome fifty people, twenty different nationalities, and all ages! I wanted this diversity, fruitful in creation.‚Äù From 2014 to June 2016, her Creative Director role extended as well to Executive Vice President Communication. Her vision was to build further consistency across all creative aspects of the Swarovski CGB division from products and collections through communication campaigns, branding, PR & media. In that role, she had close collaborations with Miranda Kerr and Karlie Kloss, the brand muses, and talents in the fashion industry such as Edward Enninful, Bryanboy, Pat McGrath, Craig Mc Dean, or Nick Knight. Since 2006, Nathalie has always been a core member of the Management Board, contributing to define & implement a winning business strategy for CGB. As of July 1, 2016, Nathalie is now reporting to Robert Buchbauer, Swarovski Executive Board Member and Swarovski family member.

It has been continually occupied, in one form or another, from the Iberian era (4th century B.C) to present. During the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì1939) the Republican anti-air defence authority (DECA) found that the hill was the most suitable place to build its anti-aircraft battery, which was instrumental in republican efforts to defend Barcelona. Post Spanish Civil-War the then abandoned military structures were used as shelters and the shanty town of Els Canons, which survived into the ‚Äò90s, sprung up around them. Also during this time, water tanks and communication towers were installed, some of which can still be seen to this day.  Iberian Settlement  In 1932, archaeologist Josep Colomines i Roca started excavations of an Iberian settlement at the summit of Tur√≥ de la Rovira. Here he uncovered part of a mural and some entrances, as well as an amount of other artefacts of significant interest. Civil War Anti-Air Defences  Aviation became the definitive weapon of post-WW1 conflict and significantly influenced the course of the Spanish Civil-War. Bombing was the perfect tool to disrupt the economy of war and the Bombing of Barcelona was the first large-scale and systematic aerial bombardment of any city. Seeing as Barcelona was easy to locate due to its characteristic seafront, authorities decided against continuing a passive defence of the sea and air, instead focussing on protecting their citizens through active defences, designed to neutralise enemy bombardments. For the locating of enemy planes, observation and listening centres were used. However, its lighting projectors, reflectors and acoustic locator apparatus (early form of radar) were not very precise. As for the neutralisation of enemy attacks, anti-aircraft guns and fighter planes were used. The air defence of Barcelona consisted of surrounding the city with gun batteries giving a range of fire that could stop, or at least disrupt, the attacks carried out by German and Italian Air Forces who were allied to Franco. The batteries were situated in two zones: The waterfront where three to four batteries were split between Montju√Øc and Poblenou, and Tur√≥ de la Rovira where another battery was set up. Batteries were also relocated from the fronts to the city to further bolster its protection when needed. Each battery was complete with acoustic locators and various reflectors protected by anti-aircraft guns. These batteries became known as batteries of light and sound. The Tur√≥ de la Rovira battery consisted of four Vickers 105mm cannons and an ammunition depot protected by an anti-aircraft machine gun. The artillery was disabled during a republican retreat between 25 and 26 January 1939, but the battle continued on the hilltop for some while longer.  Els Canons Shantytown  Since the early twentieth century, Barcelona grew rapidly. The lack of housing was constant and this saw the uncontrolled growth of slums. Many slums that emerged in the first half of the century continued to grow up until the 1990s. By the end of the 1950s, shantytowns had reached their peak, with 20,000 huts housing some 100,000 people, about 6% of Barcelona‚Äôs population. This informal city stretched the length of the beach from Somorrostro to the old Chinatown (now the Vila Ol√≠mpica to F√≤rum) as well as in the hills of Montju√Øc and El Carmel, on the southern slopes of Tur√≥ de la Rovira. At the summit of Tur√≥ de la Rovira the now disused gun battery was soon to be reused, and became a nucleus of new informal housing. The popular name Los Ca√±ones came unequivocally from the military use of the site during the Civil War. The inhabitants arranged their huts in remarkable order in relation to the central axis of the battery, which they converted into their main street, and adapted to the complicated topography of the land. The general appearance of the shantytown corresponds with the architecture of Andalusia from where many of the inhabitants originated. The district, characterised by strong organisational ties to the workers' unions, came to have around 110 huts and 600 residents. One of the main problems for inhabitants was water supply. It is no wonder then that, following the installation of a reservoir in 1963 by Barcelona‚Äôs water authority, someone managed to attach an improvised fountain, which can still be seen. The shanty dwellers formed a representative group, the Carmel Residents Association (l‚ÄôAssociaci√≥ de Ve√Øns del Carmel) in 1972. In the mid-seventies, the association went to the city council looking for basic infrastructure; refuse bins, public toilets and running water. It took up until the late ‚Äò90s for the council to finally to commit to supplying the services. The neighbourhood association also pushed for the creation of a school for adults in the area.  MUHBA Heritage Site  Its renovation in 2011 has transformed the Tur√≥ de la Rovira into a new space that combines its archaeological heritage with an outdoor museum and enclosed exhibit. With a unique perspective, it is part of the so-called balcony of Barcelona, which includes the Tres Turons (Three Hills), from Vallcarca bridge to Hill of the Rovira, it is strategic point from which to explain the urban development of the city.

It was subdivided into WCA-2A and WCA-2B by way of the L-67 canal and levees as a safeguard against seepage into the aquifer. WCA-3A WCA-3A makes up 786 square miles of the whole area and is responsible for delivering water to both Everglades National Park and Miami-Dade County.

Background  Bartolome R. Reonal served as a Philippine Scout from July 1946 to March 1947. His service medical records showed that he had broken his femur prior to service. He ended being medically discharged due to this pre-existing condition. After service, Mr. Reonal claimed service connection for this condition. He was initially denied service connection and multiple attempts to reopen the claim were also denied. In 1988, he filed again for service connection, this time submitting a report from a doctor that stated that the condition was acquired during service and that this condition was documented on a separation report from the 20th Station Hospital at Pasig, Rizal, Philippines. The VA Regional Office did not reopen the claim once again and the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA) affirmed this decision. BVA noted that the medical opinion was based solely on the history of the claimant and that the doctor had not reviewed the service medical records.  Analysis  The Court noted that the presumption of credibility did not apply to the medical opinion provided, since it was provided on lay history alone and was in direct opposition to the documented medical history presented in the service medical records. Since the medical opinion was flawed, it did not serve to reopen the claim, as it did not have a reasonable possibility of changing the outcome of the final decision.

They are used to provide heat for a process or can serve as reactor which provides heats of reaction. Furnace designs vary as to its function, heating duty, type of fuel and method of introducing combustion air. Heat is generated by an industrial furnace by mixing fuel with air or oxygen, or from electrical energy. The residual heat will exit the furnace as flue gas. These are designed as per international codes and standards the most common of which are ISO 13705 (Petroleum and natural gas industries ‚Äî Fired heaters for general refinery service) / American Petroleum Institute (API) Standard 560 (Fired Heater for General Refinery Service). Types of industrial furnaces include batch ovens, vacuum furnaces, and solar furnaces. Industrial furnaces are used in applications such as chemical reactions, cremation, oil refining, and glasswork.  Overview  alt=Fuel flows into the burner and is burnt with air provided from an air blower. There can be more than one burner in a particular furnace which can be arranged in cells which heat a particular set of tubes. Burners can also be floor mounted, wall mounted or roof mounted depending on design. The flames heat up the tubes, which in turn heat the fluid inside in the first part of the furnace known as the radiant section or firebox. In this chamber where combustion takes place, the heat is transferred mainly by radiation to tubes around the fire in the chamber. The fluid to be heated passes through the tubes and is thus heated to the desired temperature. The gases from the combustion are known as flue gas. After the flue gas leaves the firebox, most furnace designs include a convection section where more heat is recovered before venting to the atmosphere through the flue gas stack. (HTF=Heat Transfer Fluid. Industries also use their furnaces to heat a secondary fluid with special additives like anti-rust and high heat transfer efficiency. This heated fluid is then circulated round the whole plant to heat exchangers to be used wherever heat is needed instead of directly heating the product line as the product or material may be volatile or prone to cracking at the furnace temperature.) Components =Radiant section= alt= The radiant section is where the tubes receive almost all its heat by radiation from the flame. In a vertical, cylindrical furnace, the tubes are vertical. Tubes can be vertical or horizontal, placed along the refractory wall, in the middle, etc., or arranged in cells. Studs are used to hold the insulation together and on the wall of the furnace. They are placed about 1 ft (300 mm) apart in this picture of the inside of a furnace. The tubes, shown below, which are reddish brown from corrosion, are carbon steel tubes and run the height of the radiant section. The tubes are a distance away from the insulation so radiation can be reflected to the back of the tubes to maintain a uniform tube wall temperature. Tube guides at the top, middle and bottom hold the tubes in place. =Convection section= alt= The convection section is located above the radiant section where it is cooler to recover additional heat. Heat transfer takes place by convection here, and the tubes are finned to increase heat transfer. The first three tube rows in the bottom of the convection section and at the top of the radiant section is an area of bare tubes (without fins) and are known as the shield section (\\"shock tubes\\"), so named because they are still exposed to plenty of radiation from the firebox and they also act to shield the convection section tubes, which are normally of less resistant material from the high temperatures in the firebox. The area of the radiant section just before flue gas enters the shield section and into the convection section called the bridgezone. A crossover is the tube that connects from the convection section outlet to the radiant section inlet. The crossover piping is normally located outside so that the temperature can be monitored and the efficiency of the convection section can be calculated. The sightglass at the top allows personnel to see the flame shape and pattern from above and visually inspect if flame impingement is occurring. Flame impingement happens when the flame touches the tubes and causes small isolated spots of very high temperature. =Radiant coil= This is a series of tubes horizontal/ vertical hairpin type connected at ends (with 180¬∞ bends) or helical in construction. The radiant coil absorbs heat through radiation. They can be single pass or multi pass depending upon the process-side pressure drop allowed. The radiant coils and bends are housed in the radiant box. Radiant coil materials vary from carbon steel for low temperature services to high alloy steels for high temperature services. These are supported from the radiant side walls or hanging from the radiant roof. Material of these supports is generally high alloy steel. While designing the radiant coil, care is taken so that provision for expansion (in hot conditions) is kept. =Burner= alt= The burner in the vertical, cylindrical furnace as above, is located in the floor and fires upward. Some furnaces have side fired burners, such as in train locomotives. The burner tile is made of high temperature refractory and is where the flame is contained. Air registers located below the burner and at the outlet of the air blower are devices with movable flaps or vanes that control the shape and pattern of the flame, whether it spreads out or even swirls around. Flames should not spread out too much, as this will cause flame impingement. Air registers can be classified as primary, secondary and if applicable, tertiary, depending on when their air is introduced. The primary air register supplies primary air, which is the first to be introduced in the burner. Secondary air is added to supplement primary air. Burners may include a pre-mixer to mix the air and fuel for better combustion before introducing into the burner. Some burners even use steam as premix to preheat the air and create better mixing of the fuel and heated air. The floor of the furnace is mostly made of a different material from that of the wall, typically hard castable refractory to allow technicians to walk on its floor during maintenance. A furnace can be lit by a small pilot flame or in some older models, by hand. Most pilot flames nowadays are lit by an ignition transformer (much like a car's spark plugs). The pilot flame in turn lights up the main flame. The pilot flame uses natural gas while the main flame can use both diesel and natural gas. When using liquid fuels, an atomizer is used, otherwise, the liquid fuel will simply pour onto the furnace floor and become a hazard. Using a pilot flame for lighting the furnace increases safety and ease compared to using a manual ignition method (like a match). =Sootblower= Sootblowers are found in the convection section. As this section is above the radiant section and air movement is slower because of the fins, soot tends to accumulate here. Sootblowing is normally done when the efficiency of the convection section is decreased. This can be calculated by looking at the temperature change from the crossover piping and at the convection section exit. Sootblowers utilize flowing media such as water, air or steam to remove deposits from the tubes. This is typically done during maintenance with the air blower turned on. There are several different types of sootblowers used. Wall blowers of the rotary type are mounted on furnace walls protruding between the convection tubes. The lances are connected to a steam source with holes drilled into it at intervals along its length. When it is turned on, it rotates and blows the soot off the tubes and out through the stack. =Stack= alt= The flue gas stack is a cylindrical structure at the top of all the heat transfer chambers. The breeching directly below it collects the flue gas and brings it up high into the atmosphere where it will not endanger personnel. The stack damper contained within works like a butterfly valve and regulates draft (pressure difference between air intake and air exit) in the furnace, which is what pulls the flue gas through the convection section. The stack damper also regulates the heat lost through the stack. As the damper closes, the amount of heat escaping the furnace through the stack decreases, but the pressure or draft in the furnace increases which poses risks to those working around it if there are air leakages in the furnace, the flames can then escape out of the firebox or even explode if the pressure is too great. =Insulation= Insulation is an important part of the furnace because it improves efficiency by minimizing heat escape from the heated chamber. Refractory materials such as firebrick, castable refractories and ceramic fibre, are used for insulation. The floor of the furnace are normally castable type refractories while those on the walls are nailed or glued in place. Ceramic fibre is commonly used for the roof and wall of the furnace and is graded by its density and then its maximum temperature rating. For example, 8# 2,300 ¬∞F means 8 lb/ft3 density with a maximum temperature rating of 2,300 ¬∞F. The actual service temperature rating for ceramic fiber is a bit lower than the maximum rated temperature. (i.e. 2300 ¬∞F is only good to 2145 ¬∞F before permanent linear shrinkage). =Foundations= Concrete pillars are foundation on which the heater is mounted. They can be four nos. for smaller heaters and may be up to 24 nos. for large size heaters. Design of pillars and entire foundation is done based on the load bearing capacity of soil and seismic conditions prevailing in the area. Foundation bolts are grouted in foundation after installation of the heater. =Access doors= The heater body is provided with access doors at various locations. Access doors are to be used only during shutdown of heater. The normal size of the access door is 600x400 mm, which is sufficient for movement of men/ material into and out of the heater. During operation the access doors are properly bolted using leak proof high temperature gaskets.

Adjacent to the southbound lane of Minnesota State Highway 18 (MN 18), the site provides a parking area and an overlook of a small lake. The wayside was built in 1939 as part of a major New Deal project to create a scenic parkway along the shore of nearby Mille Lacs Lake. The Mille Lacs Highway Development Plan was the largest highway improvement project in the state constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). The Kenney Lake Overlook was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015 for having state-level significance in the themes of landscape architecture and politics/government. It was nominated for being a key component of a major highway improvement project, for representing the work of the Veterans Division of the CCC and the earliest scenic improvements of the Minnesota Highway Department (MHD), and for its fine National Park Service rustic design. Description The Kenney Lake Overlook stretches for about along MN 18 where it passes the northeast shore of Kenney Lake. The overlook is from Garrison and the northwest shore of Mille Lacs Lake. The site consists of a pullthrough parking area with stone curbs, and a stone overlook wall with stairs down to the lakeshore. As originally designed there was a picnic area to the southeast with picnic tables, a pair of benches at the northwest end of the overlook, and a wooden entrance sign, but these features are no longer extant. A wooden dock was planned at the base of the stairs but may never have been built. Naturalistic plantings once completed the scene. As of the mid-2010s, however, the site has lost some trees and the lakeshore is overgrown. The parking area is about long, with access to and from the highway at either end of a traffic island. Curbs of rough-cut granite blocks line the parking area and continue for a short distance in either direction along the road shoulder. Over half of the original curbing (on the east side of the traffic island and for a greater distance before and after the pullout) was removed when the highway was widened in 1982. The overlook wall stretches for about . It is constructed of light-grey granite blocks laid in a random pattern over a stone rubble core. The granite is the same as that used in the stone curbing, but is more finely dressed. The central part of the wall curves in a shallow arc around the parking area for . It is about high on the inside and up to high facing the lake. Thicker piers at intervals lend an air of medieval battlements. At the northwest end the wall continues into a diameter semicircle. The original plans refer to this as the \\"niche\\" and it was carefully built around an existing oak tree. From the outside the niche suggested a castle tower, and a drainage opening was even designed to resemble an arrowslit. The niche's floor is recessed slightly from the level of the parking lot and it provided a more intimate seating area with two benches. Both the benches and the tree are no longer extant. At the southeast end, the overlook broadens into a terrace. Symmetrical sections of wall flank a recessed area paved with flagstones which gives onto a staircase leading down to the lakeshore. History The Kenney Lake Overlook was built as a component of the Mille Lacs Lake Highway Improvement Plan, an ambitious New Deal project to transform the area around the northwest shore of the lake into a scenic parkway. The project was an unusual collaboration among the MHD, the National Park Service, and the CCC. The overlook is among the first generation of roadside parks established by the MHD in the 1930s and 40s to improve highway aesthetics, increase safety, and aid the nascent automobile tourism industry by providing scenic areas for motorists to relax, eat, and use restrooms in the years before gas stations and convenience stores became commonplace. The overlook was designed by Howard O. Skooglun, an architect working for the NPS. He collaborated with engineer Harold E. Olson and landscape architect A.R. Nichols, both with the MHD's Roadside Development Division. The trio also designed the other CCC-built components of the scenic parkway. These include the Garrison Concourse, Bridge 5265, Bridge 3355, and St. Alban's Bay Culvert, all of which are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. From September 1935 to April 1940, various CCC companies cycled through a camp just south of Garrison as work progressed on the Mille Lacs Lake Highway Improvement Plan. Company 2713-V arrived at the Garrison Camp in July 1939. The company had been established in August 1934 and spent its first two years developing Camden State Park in southwest Minnesota, then three years completing Fort Ridgely State Park in the south-central part of the state. Individual enrollees, however, only served for about nine months. While the regular companies of the CCC were for men under the age of 25, the Veterans Division was established to accept older men‚Äîveterans of World War I who had been particularly hard hit by unemployment during the Great Depression, due in part to age discrimination and high incidences of post-war physical and mental disabilities. When the overlook was constructed, MN 18 was a gravel road built through the area just six years earlier as part of a 1932‚Äì33 realignment. Stone for the wall and curbs came from a nearby quarry south of Isle, Minnesota. Granite was also obtained from quarries near St. Cloud. The masonry was completed in October 1939 and the landscaping was finished the following month, completing the project. The company continued to work in the vicinity until April 1940, when it relocated to the St. Croix Recreational Demonstration Area. Minnesota hosted over 100 CCC companies, but only about six of them comprised veterans. The Mille Lacs project was also rare in that, statewide, only four camps total were sponsored by the MHD for road development. The Kenny Lake Overlook and the nearby Bridge 3355 are the only structures built for the Minnesota Highway Department by a Veterans Division company.

Malone (July 4, 1924 ‚Äì August 12, 2008) was a pioneering member of the WAVES; trainer of aircraft carrier pilots; flight simulator instructor for the U.S. Air Force, Trans World Airlines, and Northeast Airlines; and the only woman pilot trainer for Delta Air Lines for many years. She was posthumously inducted into the Women in Aviation International Pioneer Hall of Fame in 2009 and the Georgia Aviation Hall of Fame the following year. Early life Patricia Waite was born on July 4, 1924 in Cambridge, Massachusetts to Dorothy M. \\"Billie\\" (n√©e Hammond) and Amory Hooper \\"Bud\\" Waite, Jr. Her father was a radio engineer and adventurer, who had gone on the 1939 Byrd Expedition to Antarctica and for whom Cape Waite is named. Her father encouraged her to be adventurous and follow her curiosity. When she graduated from North Quincy High School in 1942, she began working for Signal Corps Laboratories at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey as a radio engineering aide to her father. She wanted to become an air traffic controller, but was under-age and instead attended Link Trainer courses for twelve weeks in Atlanta at the Naval Air Station. After obtaining aviation training through Navy and Air Force programs, Waite joined the U.S. Navy WAVES in 1944. Career During World War II, Waite worked as a Link Trainer Operator for the Navy, training carrier based squadron pilots until 1946, when she was honorably discharged. When the war ended, she was transferred as a civilian employee of the Air Force to McGuire Air Force Base in Eatontown, New Jersey. At McGuire, she taught pilots to fly using instruments, performing pilot training on a flight simulator. In 1951, newly married and with a new baby, Waite moved to Boston and took a position with Trans World Airlines (TWA) as a Dehmel training instructor. At least until 1955, she continued using her maiden name, before at some point adopting the surname of her second husband, Peter James Malone Jr. Though she was not a pilot and had never flown in a commercial aircraft before she went to work with TWA, Tudor Leland taught her about instrumentation and credited her with saving the careers of pilots by making the instructions in the Federal Aviation Regulations understandable in plain English. In her own words she said that she \\"never taught a pilot to fly or how a plane works\\", but she taught them system operations and how to remain safe. After six years with TWA, Malone left in 1957 on maternity leave for the birth of her third child. In 1960, Malone was hired by Northeast Airlines as a flight instructor and remained with them until the 1963 layoff. During the layoff, she gave birth to her fourth child, worked briefly as a nursing aide in a Boston hospital and then returned to Northeast in 1965. She remained with Northeast until its 1972 merger with Delta Airlines, when she was relocated to Atlanta. She was tasked with creating Delta's operations specifications curriculum, which included instruction on air traffic control methodology, FAA Regulations, instrument approach charts and flight instrument reviews. She taught all levels of training, from initial instruction to re-qualifications, as well as instruction for Flight Control Dispatchers. Recognized as an industry expert, Malone gave seminars for the FAA and other airlines' personnel on flight safety issues. In 1984 she was assigned to the Delta Flight Operations, Regulatory Compliance and Incident Management team, and primarily her duties focused on safety measures and compliance. After a decade, she retired from Delta and became a consultant for Jeppesen, JetBlue and private flight operations departments of Coca-Cola, ConAgra and others, reviewing their charts and procedures, performing accident investigations and recommending safety procedures. Death and legacy Plaque honoring Malone at the Georgia Aviation Hall of Fame Malone died on August 12, 2008 of complications from a car accident which occurred several weeks earlier. She was buried in Mt. Wollaston Cemetery, in Quincy, Massachusetts, beside her late husband. Posthumously, Malone was inducted as to the Pioneer Hall of Fame of the Women in Aviation International in 2009. The following year, she was inducted into the Georgia Aviation Hall of Fame, with many tributes paid to her for being a beloved \\"Mother\\" to many of the pilots she had trained.

In 2020, China became the largest box office territory, overtaking North America in gross total. The transition, long anticipated by analysts, was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic and China's successful containment approach compared to that of the United States, the predominant country in the North American market. Japan was originally the second-largest box office territory before it was surpassed by China in 2011. In 2013, the next three largest territories were the United Kingdom, France, and India, and by 2017, South Korea became the sixth largest box office territory and close to France's rank as fifth. The box office territory of the United Kingdom comprises the UK and Ireland. Malta's box office is added to the UK and Ireland total by at least one data provider.

Language For a long time mystery surrounded the Mbabaram language. The little that was known of it hinted that it might be a language isolate, since it appeared to differ notably from the surrounding languages. In particular its vocabulary was monosyllabic, an anomaly among Australian aboriginal languages. This puzzle contributed to the Barrinean hypothesis, which regarded the Mbabaram people as a reclusive rainforest remnant of an original Negrito population. The mystery was solved, when, taking a hint from a suggestion from Kenneth Hale, Robert M. W. Dixon discovered that the ostensible differences could be accounted for by noting that Mbabaram words dropped the initial syllable present in contiguous languages, and had developed from a regular Australian language. A phonetic principle outlined by Hale laid down that a second syllable of a Mbabaram word would become o if the original word began with a g. Thus an original guwa (west) would change in Mbabaram to wo, which was indeed their word for 'west'. The word for 'dog' is also in Mbabaram the monosyllabic 'dog', not borrowed from English but, following this rule simply a clipped version of gudaga, the word for the animal in Yidin, which exists also in Dyirbal, though there shortened to guda. With this insight, Mbabaram suddenly appeared no longer aberrant, but perfectly regular as an Australian language. Country Traditional lands of the Australian aboriginal tribes around Cairns. The Mbarabam people's traditional territory is on the Atherton Tableland, was bounded by the Kuku Yalanji, near Dimbulah to the north, almost to Mareeba, the Dyirbal people to the east and the down to Irvinebank and the Warungu tribal lands to their south. It extends from an area just west of Almaden across Lappa and east to Atherton. Both Norman Tindale and Robert Dixon suggest that at some period in the past, the Mbabaram had moved from or been driven out of the rainforest, westwards into scrubland. By the time of Tindale's investigations descendants were living on 'sterile and rugged granite ranges.' History of contact Following reports that tin lay in their district, Willie Jack and John Newell prospected the area and discovered a payable load Prospectors Gully in 1880 Dixon estimated that the original Mbabaram population must have been around 500 before white settlement began in the late 19th century. By the time he began his fieldwork in the mid 1960s, he found that mining and the destruction of their rainforest 'had ensured that the Mbabaram tribe had dropped... to three old tired men.' The Barrinean hypothesis In a publication of 1941, Norman Tindale, together with the American anthropologist Joseph Birdsell, published a paper suggesting that there were 12 Negrito tribes living on the coastal and rainforest areas around Cairns. The idea had been developed by Birdsell during field work in 1937-8. They were characterized by very short stature, curly hair, and yellowy-brown skin. Six of them were Dyirbal speakers, such as the Jirrbal, Girramay, Gulngai and Djiru within the Murray Upper/Tully Area. Of the others, located further north beyond Cairns, two spoke varieties of Djabugay, and three spoke dialects of Yidin. The remaining tribe were the Mbabaram, whom Tindale took to be strong evidence for his hypothesis because their language, in so far as it had been reported, diverged substantially from the surrounding tongues, and appeared to be wholly atypical, compared to the standard Australian aboriginal languages. They thought they could identify 8 characteristics shared by the Mbabaram with the other rainforest tribes: * A patrilineal moiety system based on 4 sections * Partial mummification of the deceased * The dead were not immediately disposed of, but were cremated only after the jawbones and skulls had been taken about with the nomadic tribes for a certain period of time. * Having recourse to cannibalism as a food resource * Deploying fighting shields that were emblazoned with decorations * Manufacturing clothes out of bark * Manufacturing baskets fashioned from wood harvested off fig trees, stitched together by string derived from the lawyer-cane * Adopting a lengthy leaching process to nuts with high alkaloid content and potentially toxic, in order to render the fruit edible. A trihybrid thesis had been advanced in the late 19th century redolent of early ideas concerning supposed pure racial types, which posited that Australia had been populated by 3 successive waves of peoples. Supposedly these were the remnants of the hypothetical first wave of peoples to enter Australia, who were then thrust aside by further immigrations, successively undertaken by two distinct peoples with a superior hunting technology. The Tindale‚ÄìBirdsell argument had revived this model. Birdsell in particular argued that the putative Negrito type surviving in the tropical forests of northern Queensland, were to be taken as Barrineans. He linked them to the Andamanese, arguing they were a \\"pygmy\\" group that was the residue of the wave otherwise represented by the \\"extinct\\" Tasmanian aboriginals. They had retreated into the rainforest as waves of the light-skinned Murrayians affiliated to the Ainu came through. The third group were the Carpentarians, a dark people with a pronounced brow ridge, whom it was thought were affiliated to ancient Indian tribes. Birdsell's theory gained wide circulation when Norman Tindale's storybook, The First Walkabout, (1954) coauthored by H. A. Lindsay, became a best-seller. There was no hard evidence for this, archaeological or anthropometric, and it was said to have fallen out of favour. Robert M. W. Dixon, who since the 1960s had been recording the languages of the north Queensland rainforest people, did not exclude the idea. Rumours concerning the Mbabaram as a physically small people who spoke a very different language from their neighbours, held out some chance that the hypothesis held a grain of truth. Dixon eventually determined that Birdsell's theory could not be shown to correlate with the linguistic parameters. In 2002, it was revived when Keith Windschuttle and Tom Gittin accused modern scholars in Australia of having suppressed the evidence, partially to cater to the feelings of Aboriginal activists disturbed (according to them) by the idea that, given successive waves of \\"invasion\\", their claims to native title might suffer from a hierarchy of claims, according to which tribes descended from which hypothetical ancestor of the three.

The painted surface measures some , and the panel is about larger in both dimensions.Campbell, 139 The panel comes from a dismantled altarpiece from which one other panel appears to survive, the Lamentation that is also in the National Gallery (NG 1078). The Adoration of the Magi is a common subject, which often represents the Nativity of Jesus in art, especially in this period, when the opportunity was often taken to show rich costumes in the figures of the Biblical Magi and their retinue, as for example in the slightly earlier Adoration by Jan Gossaert, also in the National Gallery, to which David is sometimes thought to have contributed.Gossaert, 17‚Äì20 Though that is a much larger and more crowded painting, David may have borrowed aspects of the composition here from it.Campbell, 144, 145 However, David's treatment here is relatively simple and restrained, with the five main figures occupying most of the picture space, and none of the angels who are prominent in most of the many other depictions of the Nativity by David and his workshop. As very often, the Adoration of the Shepherds is here conflated with that of the three kings. Behind the king on the right two of the shepherds kneel, and behind them three heads from the royal retinues wear exotic turbans. Another figure in a turban stands in shadow some steps up the staircase in the tower at left, cut off at the edge of the paint, this is \\"clearly Saint Joseph\\".Campbell, 143 The traditional ox and ass are not in the main scene, but can be seen through the ruined wall above the foremost king's head, respectively sitting and grazing on a patch of grass. There is a view of a section of the suburbs of Bethlehem visible at the centre, and to the right the imposing walls and skyline of the town itself. Original altarpiece Detail of the heads at right For all the known history of the painting it has been together with the NG 1078 Lamentation, but this goes no further back than early 19th-century London. Whether the two originally formed part of the same polytych is not quite certain, but it seems most likely.Campbell, 145; Ainsworth, 177 The Lamentation is some 3 cm larger in both dimensions, and its underdrawing \\"is inconsistent in style and some parts can be reconciled with the underdrawing of the Adoration\\", but others not.Campbell, 144 In the two panels the figures are about the same size, and the horizons at the same level, and no other panels of these dimensions are attributed to David or his workshop. Both are planed down at the back, and may originally have been painted on both sides, as parts of the wings of an altarpiece on the Life of Christ or Life of the Virgin, with a central panel about four times the size of these ones.Campbell, 144‚Äì145 Provenance Both this and the companion Lamentation may have been in a sale of the pictures of Frederick Benjamin King (a bankrupt sugar-refiner) at Christie's in London in June 1830, where Lot 82 was an Adoration described as by \\"J. de Maubeuge\\", that is to say Jan Gossaert, who was born in Maubeuge. The Lamentation was merely described as \\"Flemish\\". They fetched ¬£4 and ¬£4, 12 shillings respectively, but different buyers are recorded. Both paintings have a pink paper label inscribed \\"King 157\\" pasted on their reverses.Campbell, 134, 139 If they were separated at this point, they were reunited by 1831, when their certain history begins, in the collection of Karl Aders, a German merchant resident in London. Both were auctioned again in August 1835 and bought by a Dr Willis, later passing to a surgeon, Joseph Henry Green, who lived in Monken Hadley, a little way north of London. Both paintings were exhibited in the huge and important Art Treasures Exhibition, held in Manchester in 1857. Green died in 1863 and his widow (Anne Eliza, d. 1879) bequeathed all the Dutch and Flemish paintings in the collection to the National Gallery, who received them in 1880. No loans to outside exhibitions are recorded since (to 1998).Campbell, 134, 139 Attribution The painting is now considered likely to be mainly by David himself, with the usual assistance from his workshop ‚Äì at this date he may have been running two simultaneously, in Antwerp and Bruges.Campbell, 116 It is certainly in his style, and \\"none of David's immediate followers seems to have had sufficient skill to produce a composition of such pleasing simplicity\\" and \\"the technique agrees in most respects with David's\\". Like many Early Netherlandish paintings, it has been attributed to many other painters in the past, as understanding of the period developed. The painting auctioned in 1830 was described as by Jan Gossaert, and in the Aders sale and Green collection it was described as a Hans Memling. Of the early authorities, Gustav Friedrich Waagen in the 1850s called it \\"School of van Eyck\\" and Johann David Passavant in the 1830s a \\"Rogier van der Weyden the younger\\". The National Gallery cautiously first catalogued it merely as \\"Flemish School\\", only changing to David in 1920. This had first been suggested by Georges Hulin de Loo in 1902, although he did not think the painting was from the hand of the master himself. In 20th century scholarship the main issue debated was the share of work between master and workshop.

His son Godfrey also became a footballer and his grandson is golfer Darren Clarke. His nephews Joe and Derek Meldrum appeared for the Distillery team which played Benfica in the 1963 European Cup.  Early life  Clarke was born at Ballygarvey just outside Ballymena, Co. Antrim, Ireland. His father Nathaniel was a horse trainer. By 1915 the family were living in the Milltown area of Dungannon, Co. Tyrone. His early employment was at the factory of Messrs Dickson & Co., Dungannon.  Football career  = Early Days = By 1931, Clarke was part of the Dungannon Town team, who were competing in Mid Ulster Junior football. He was part of the team which won the Mid Ulster Shield in 1932. He also was selected for several representative teams. His performances led to a move to Irish League side Portadown in 1932. After gaining a regular first team place, he helped the side to win their first senior trophy, the Gold Cup in 1933. He also gained a place on the Ireland Amateur team, winning two caps against England and Scotland in 1934. By this stage he was drawing the attention of English League Clubs. In May 1934, an offer in the region of ¬£2500 ‚Äì ¬£3000 was accepted from Division 2 side Sheffield United (The club had been relegated; for the first time, from Division 1 the previous season, however they had previously had mid table finishes). = Career in England = Clarke was with Sheffield United for three years. He made sporadic appearances for the first team, mainly playing for the reserves. The first choice right-back being club captain Harry Hooper. His first appearance of the 1935‚Äì36 season came in a 2-0 Home win against local rivals Barnsley, in April 1936. This came about due to an injury sustained by Hooper. His previous first team appearance had been against Nottingham Forest on cup final day of the previous season. He also played in the next match a draw away to Port Vale. However Hooper retook his place, after recovering from injury, to captain the side for the final of the 1936 FA Cup, which ended in 1-0 victory for Arsenal. By 1937, Clarke was looking for a new club and joined Third Division South side Exeter City, in August. Early in his time at Exeter, with the team struggling, he was deployed as centre- forward, having scored eight goals in two games for the reserves. He was released by the club at the end of the 1938‚Äì39 season. He subsequently joined Carlisle United, a Third Division North side in June 1939. However the league was suspended after only three matches, due to the outbreak of war. = Return to Northern Ireland = By December 1939, Clarke, had joined Irish League side Coleraine as their player manager. He guided the club to eighth position in the league (1939‚Äì40 season), an improvement on 14th (bottom), the previous season. By 1945, he was again playing for Portadown, who were an Intermediate League team at the time. In 1949, he was involved in the formation of Dungannon Swifts and subsequently became their player coach. He led the team to numerous successes in their early years.

He has directed five action films: Kistimaat, Gangster Returns, Musafir, Operation Agneepath and Super Hero . He wrote all except Kistimaat. Early life Ashiqur Rahman was born in Dhaka. He completed his Bachelor in Civil Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). Later Ashiqur Rahman graduated from University of Technology Sydney in Master of Civil and Environmental Engineering and from the University of Dhaka he completed Master in Television & Film Studies. Ashiqur Rahman is member of BFDC Cinematographers Association and Member of BFDC Film Directors Association. He is also a member of Australian Director Guild and Engineers Australia. Career In April 2013, Rahman began shooting for TV a script he coauthored with Shimon Mahmud. The action story drama serial, tentatively titled Gangster, starred Ziaul Faruq Apurba, was being produced by Intract Film and Media, and was planned to be broadcast on satellite channel Asian TV. When Asian TV saw clips of the first phase of shooting, they suggested it be made as a movie instead, produced jointly by Asian TV and Saiful Azim. By November, the project was retitled Gangster Returns. Meanwhile, Rahman began shooting action film Kistimaat, which was released in 2014. Gangster Returns eventually released on 27 November 2015. Rahman's third film, which he also wrote, is action thriller Musafir. It released on 22 April 2016, and was well received by audiences. Fahmim Ferdous of The Daily Star praised the attempt to tell an original story, the dialog, and cinematography, but found that some scenes were unnecessary, and the plot didn't entirely hold together. He wrote, \\"Ashiqur Rahman has shown promise, and one can only hope he gets better.\\" The Rahman-directed short musical film Sarangshe Tumi also premiered in April. After four years away from TV production, Rahman directed the action drama Princess for Asian TV. Late in 2016, he was filming Operation Agneepath.

It is equipped with a 98-horsepower, four-stroke, V-twin engine, adjustable heavy-duty offroad suspension, and enduro styling. Due to its light weight and offroad-capable profile, the 950SE was perceived at its launch as a radical departure from any existing dual- sport, enduro, or street bike models, while having characteristics of all three. Marketed by KTM, its Austrian manufacturer, as a race-ready enduro machine, the 950SE embodies minimalist design principles. Equipped with twin carburetors instead of electronic fuel injection, it also lacks ABS, traction control, a fuel gauge, or a tachometer. Its dual silencers are upswept, with the front cylinder‚Äôs exhaust header routed beside the engine, in the manner of smaller enduro and dirt bikes. The one-piece plastic fuel tank is of relatively low capacity, and the seat is comparably tall at 920mm (36.22 inches). With its six-speed transmission and stock wheels, the 950SE is capable of speeds in excess of 190km/h (118mph). The 950SE is claimed to be one of the most-powerful and ‚Äúintense‚Äù enduro motorcycles. Yet, in spite of its power, loud and deep exhaust note, and fierce acceleration capabilities, the 950SE is lauded for its all-round performance and rider comfort, whether on- or off-pavement. In his review of the 2008 model, motorcycle journalist Neil Johnson of OneWheelDrive, said, ‚Äúthe KTM 950 Super Enduro R is pure delightful lunacy.‚Äù The article‚Äôs headline was sub-titled ‚ÄúThe cure for common sense.‚Äù Approximately 3,000 units were produced and sold internationally for model years 2006-2008. KTM discontinued the model in 2009. Since before its discontinuation, the 950SE is coveted, achieving ‚Äúlegend‚Äù status among owners and enthusiasts, including offroad and rally-racing champions such as New Zealander Chris Birch: \\"In my mind, the 950 Super Enduro is the best hooligan's bike KTM ever made.\\" The 950SE‚Äôs 942cc engine, known as the LC-8, was designed by KTM engineers to power the company‚Äôs 950 Factory Rally racer to compete in the 2002 Dakar Rally. In contrast to KTM‚Äôs first LC-8-equipped consumer model, the 950 Adventure, modeled on the Dakar bike, the 950SE had higher ground clearance, a different steering head angle and rake, with a more-aggressive adjustable WP suspension, as well as the distinctive look and ride of an \\"oversized\\" enduro bike. At the time of the 950SE‚Äôs launch, the dual-sport market was dominated by slower heavier ‚Äúcompromise‚Äù bikes. But the KTM appealed to aficionados as a ‚Äúno-compromise‚Äù motorcycle. On rider forums, owners frequently praise the SE as a ‚Äúhigh-adrenaline‚Äù machine, and it can be ridden out of the city, onto the highway, and into challenging terrain such as water crossings, boulder fields, steep hill-climbs, single-track trails, rutted tracks, mudholes and deep sand, then rode home again at highway speed, remaining equally at-ease and comfortable to ride through such widely-varying conditions. The 950 SE was the third consumer model to use the LC-8 engine after the KTM 950 Adventure and 950 Super Moto. It shares several components of the latter, but the SE was significantly-modified to suit its intended purpose.  Origin  The 950SE is KTM's response to the BMW HP2, a well- regarded high-performance dirtbike whose 1170cc 'boxer' engine made 105-horsepower. The HP2 won its first competition start in 2005 at the Erzberg Rodeo in Styria, Austria, an annual \\"hard enduro\\" race series attracting hundreds of competitors from around the world. BMW's Motorrad Enduro Team Feil entered riders Simo Kirssi, Jimmy Lewis, and the winner of the previous year's Erzberg Hare Scramble, Chris Pfeiffer. At the time, KTM was recovering after a long period of stagnation, with a mandate to dominate in the offroad racing sector. Many industry watchers believed KTM rushed its 950SE into production to demonstrate its \\"big bike\\" capabilities against its European rival. Like the 950SE, the HP2 was a short-lived model, debuting in 2005 and discontinued in 2008.  Development   Testing   Racing success   Mass production   Technical advances   Powerplant   Launch  The new KTM 950 Super Enduro R was featured the 2006 EICMA Motor Show in Milan and won the Erzberg Rodeo race that May.  Technical Issues  The 950SE is generally accepted as a robust offroad/trail motorcycle. However, it exhibits a number of weaknesses: Sump guard: The factory sump guard is a lightweight pressed aluminium bash-plate. The majority of riders taking the 950SE offroad fit a heavyweight after-market version. Voltage regulator/rectifier (VRR): The VRR is located under the seat, immediately behind the rear cylinder header pipe. In temperate climates, this causes few problems, but in hotter locations (southern USA, Australia, etc), the combination of high temperatures coupled with the heat from the exhaust frequently causes the VRR to fail. Oil tank: The oil tank is mounted at the front of the engine immediately behind the front wheel. In the event of a large impact in this area, it is possible for the oil tank to move up on its mounts, consequently bending the lower section of the radiator. Rear sub-frame: The rear sub-frame has locating points for the attachment of the rear plastic fairing. Of these, two in particular (a threaded screw hole each side) form a weak point where, if sufficient load is applied to the rear of the rear sub-frame (such as carrying a heavy load on a luggage rack), a crack will propagate from the screw holes, eventually leading to failure of the frame. In an effort to prevent this failure, many owners weld aluminium supports to the frame to bolster the weak areas. Fuel pump: In its original form, the OEM fuel pump has electro-mechanical points providing actuation of the fuel diaphragm. These eventually fail, although owners report differing time periods of just a few 1,000km up to 30,000km. The engine will run without a fuel pump, but only with a full fuel tank to provide sufficient head to the carburettors. Aftermarket fixes include replacement of the pump with a Facet pump, fitting a vacuum pump, or modifying the existing pump. A popular modification replaces the electro-mechanical points with an optical sensor and associated circuitry. Since the 950SE shares some of the heritage from the KTM 950 Adventure series development (principally the LC8 engine/transmission unit), it suffers from similar issues: Side-stand mounting: The side-stand mount bolts into the casting forming the lower section of the left side crankcase. In the event of a hard impact on the side- stand, a torsional load is passed to the crankcase... and it invariably fails. This potentially-expensive weakness is frequently-addressed by the fitting of an aftermarket side-stand relocating kit to remove the mount from the crankcase, and place it directly to the frame. Clutch slave: The KTM 950/990 LC8 series engine uses a hydraulically-actuated clutch system with conventional master and slave cylinders. The OEM slave (manufactured by Magura) has a failure mode in which the piston starts to tilt in the bore, causing the slave to fail. The 950SE suffers the same problem. It is generally-resolved by the fitting of an aftermarket slave unit; a popular choice is the Oberon slave cylinder manufactured in England. The failure occurs at any point; some owners report problems at 5,000km, others reach 50,000km.  Commercial failure   Cult following  After the KTM 950SE was released, it attracted limited interest. Dealers frequently had to offer considerable incentives to make initial sales. However, since approximately 2015, there is a marked increase in desirability with prices steadily rising to the point a good second-hand example changes hands for a price equal to or above the original manufacturers MSRP. The Erzberg Rodeo Editions, a limited production with enhanced graphics and other items such as Akrapovic exhausts, a CNC clutch cover, etc., fetch proportionally more. In Europe, the Erzberg bikes were individually-numbered denoted by a triangular badge on the top triple clamp. In the USA, they were not numbered, hence, the number of Erzbergs produced is unknown, although the generally-accepted number is in the order of 100. Because of the limited total production numbers (circa 3000 worldwide), the 950SE is not a common motorcycle, hence prospective buyers must generally be dedicated in searching examples for sale, further enhancing the desirability. Various websites exist dedicated to the 950SE, notably www.950superenduro.com and a significant element of the ADVRider forums, specifically Orange Crush, Crazy Awesome Almost Dakar Racers 950/990 Through these websites, there is a considerable body of experience in owning and riding the 950SE, and most owners are very happy to share pearls of wisdom. Like any rare or unusual car, aeroplane, motorbike, yacht, etc., owners generally-feel privileged to own a 950SE, and they exhibit considerable camaraderie.

He began his career in 1982 creating canvases in oil on canvas, where he applies his own technique, which, according to him, allows a perfect balance in the distribution of the elements, leading the viewer to come across texture, plasticity and creation, in perfect Harmony within the history of each painting. The style of Vignoli is a fusion between Surrealism and Expressionism, hence the declared influence by the Spanish master Salvador Dal√≠. By 2013, Vignoli work had been exhibited in more than 20 nations. Vignoli develops in his painting a very personal interpretation of human dramas, dealing with stylistic references of Romanticism, Expressionism and metaphysical painting, movements that, like Surrealism, dedicated themselves to interrogating inexpressible human dimensions. In his work it is possible to see paintings by Picasso, Munch, Mir√≥, Magritte and Dal√≠ adorning abandoned walls and chairs. The poetic content of the scenes is pronounced following the mysterious language of the dream, providing metaphors and multiple interpretations. Fernando Vignoli died on a Tuesday afternoon (December 13, 2016) in his hometown Belo Horizonte. The artist, who was struggling with leukemia, had been hospitalized on the day before. However, he ended up not resisting the complications and died due to sepsis.

Operating under the University of St Andrews Athletic Union, the club competes in head races and regattas across Scotland and England, including the Head of the River Race (London), British University Championships 'BUCS' Regatta and Henley Royal Regatta. Its national governing body is Scottish Rowing and the registration code of 'SAU'.  History  The club was founded in the 1962-1963 academic year by John Browne with one coxed four and 6 athletes. The club rowed on the River Eden until the late 1990s until they moved to River Tay, Perth due to extremely tidal waters. In January 2016, the club moved again to Loch Ore, Fife. A Senior Men's coxed four (4+) won the Scottish Rowing Championships 2012 and in the 2015-2016 season, many Club records were set with the Men's 1st VIII and Women's 1st VIII breaking the previous Club records for the Head of the River Race (HORR) and Women's Head of the River Race (WeHORR). Additionally, the Club qualified for the Prince Albert Challenge Cup at Henley Royal Regatta and the Cathy Cruickshank Trophy for Academic Coxed Fours at Henley Women's Regatta in 2016, and continue to race at these events annually, with growing athlete numbers. The Club has gone onto win a shield at the British Senior Rowing Championships, and the VL trophy at Scottish Indoor Rowing Championships in 2018. The 2019 season was one of excellence for the Boat Club. The Senior Women reaffirmed their position as W4- medalists at BUCS and achieved the first gold medal for the club in the Wint2-, which featured Lydia Theos and Kirstin Giddy. The Senior Men equally cemented themselves within the rowing community; from breaking club records at Head of the River Race (HORR), to winning the second gold BUCS medal, amongst others. Their most notable achievement of the season was reaching semi-finals of the Prince Albert Challenge Cup at Henley Royal Regatta. Many of the club members went on to represent Team Scotland at Home International Regatta.  Facilities & Training  The University of St Andrews Boat Club utilises indoor studio space for land training as well as usage of specialist Strength and Conditioning facilities within the University Sports complex. Following a move, in early 2016, from their previous training waters on the River Tay, Perth, the Club now trains on Loch Ore in Lochore Meadows Country Park, Fife. The 1.4km long Loch provides more favourable training conditions and facilities.  The Community  Taking pride in their community, the Boat Club organises a 24-hour ergathon every September. All members of the club take it in turns to row for a consecutive 24-hour period in order to raise money for Maggie's Centres. The Development Officers over the years have been developing a school's programme, to widen the sport to the larger community. Madras College worked with the Boat Club throughout the 2018-19 season, to encourage sport amongst their students. As of 2019, the Boat Club began a brand new schools program at Lochgelly High School. Rowers of St Andrews are volunteering their time to help move the High School up to first place in the Scottish Indoors Rowing League.

Student Zurich leads the pledge class as they endure big brother hazing on campus and at line ups at fraternity house. The pledges balance their time in class with English professor Hughes and their new fraternity life of parties, sorority girls and dating. The pledge class learns the brotherhood mottos and bonds together because of or despite moral and physical hazing. Dean Richardson, a Lambda Phi alumnus, holds himself out as an example of the fraternity system and extols its virtues. He makes himself available to be told of pledge abuse but not far enough to break the fraternity code of silence and secrecy. One night the hazing goes too far and a big brother advises the pledge class to drop off a seriously injured pledge at the emergency room but to avoid the cameras. Despite the advice, the young neophyte fraternity brothers wait together at the hospital awaiting the fate of their friend, Frank. After seconds of waiting the doctor tells them that Frank died of a ruptured aorta artery.

Coffee with D was released on 20 January 2017. The film received mixed reviews from critics and failed commercially at the box office. Plot Arnab Ghosh (Sunil Grover) is a Senior Editor and news anchor at NB news channel. He hosts a prime-time show, interviewing different people including politicians. Due to low ratings, his boss, Roy (Rajesh Sharma), transfers him to a cookery show and asks him to come up with a new idea for another show. Parul (Anjana Sukhani), Arnab's wife, suggests he interviews feared Don/crime boss, D (Zakir Hussain). Arnab and his colleagues shoot fake videos about D, and post them on social media in order to make D angry. He agrees to stop posting the videos after receiving a call from Girdhari (Pankaj Tripathi), D's CEO, on the condition that D consents to be interviewed. D agrees, while planning to kill Arnab live, during the TV show. Arnab and his colleagues are brought to a secret location in Karachi by D's men, while two other gangsters arrive at Arnab's home in order to hold his family hostage. Arnab starts the interview, however D does not answer any of the questions correctly. Arnab receives a call from his wife, who asks him not to be a coward, but to prove D wrong. In the last part of the interview, Arnab accuses D of being responsible for terrorist activities, calling him a fraud and not a Don. On hearing this D dies of a heart attack. Later, at his home, Arnab receives a call from a David Adrees Kaleman, who reveals himself to be D. A flashback shows that D only pretended to die, so that he could leave his original identity and begin a new life. Arnab is happy that there is no longer any persona such as D left in the world.

BookMyShow wrote in its review \\"Sunil Grover, who is otherwise known for his acts in popular TV shows, makes it rather unsettling for the audience to see him play a role this serious initially. He, however, does not disappoint for most part of the film. Zakir Hussain, too, delivers a mindblowing performance as D. It is Pankaj Tripathi who plays D's right-hand man that steals the show with his spot-on comic timing, making us wish we saw more of him.\\" Bollywood Life rated the film 2.5/5, writing \\"Honestly, I went to watch the movie expecting to kill myself by the end of it.

But is it a successful effort? Barely.\\" Fullhyd.com rated the film 1.75/5, writing \\"Apart from the obviously incorrect caricature of the bombastic demeanour of India's most renown media personality, CWD's version of D lacks substance and depth. Although Zakir Hussain's emoting is satisfying, the character development isn't layered enough. Little research seems to have gone into the person. If you are going to ask some \\"tough\\" questions of and decode a hated don in the hit list of nearly 10 nations, the scripting and the emoting need to be up to the challenge. Instead, director Vishal Mishra shows how he isn't interested in judging D and how he hates to offend the gang and the nation.\\" Koimoi rated the film 1.5/5, and wrote \\"Coffee With D is strictly avoidable.

History The first documentary reference to the castle dates to 1192, when Pope Celestine III conferred castrum carbonana to Bentivoglio, bishop of Gubbio. The first lords of the castle were the descendants of Bino di Pietro of the Gabrielli family.S. Tiberini - S. Merli, Il castello eugubino di Carbonana e i suoi signori (secoli XII-XVIII), Perugia, Deputazione di storia patria per l'Umbria, 2015, pp. 28‚Äì29. Bino di Pietro was the younger brother of Cante Gabrielli, the podest√† of Florence who exiled the Dante Alighieri in 1302. In the 14th century, Gubbio also made use of the fortress and its tower to defend and control of the surrounding territory. In the 1420s, the castle passed to the Porcelli family as a result of the marriage of Giacomo di Galeotto of the Porcelli family to Checca, the widow of Giacomo Gabrielli, who on her mother‚Äôs side belonged to the noble Atti di Sassoferrato family.S. Tiberini - S. Merli, Il castello eugubino di Carbonana e i suoi signori (secoli XII-XVIII), pp. 57‚Äì58, 160-171. These Porcelli are descendants of Rigo campsor olim de Florentia (a money changer in Florence) whose presence in Gubbio is documented already in 1286.S. Tiberini - S. Merli, Il castello eugubino di Carbonana e i suoi signori (secoli XII-XVIII), pp. 68‚Äì74. The Porcelli assumed the position of counts of Carbonana. During the 16th and 17th centuries, members of the family rose to the highest offices in Gubbio and distinguished themselves as mercenaries of the Republic of Venice. The Porcelli patronized the decoration of the castle‚Äôs chapel, the enlargement of the castle on the south side and the construction of the elegant round tower on the south-east angle of the bailey. Since the 16th century, the structure has undergone only minor adjustments which never altered substantially its aspect or its proportions of the castle. The building was bought in 2011 by private owners, who completed in 2014 a restoration under the supervision of the Soprintendenza ai Beni Architettonici e Paesaggistici of Umbria. .

History  Stanis≈Çaw Witkiewicz - architect of the museum building and founder of Zakopane style; here in a self-portrait The museum was established by the Tatra Museum Society, and the building which today serves as the main branch, located in the centre of Zakopane, at 10 Krup√≥wki Street, was designed specifically for this purpose by Stanis≈Çaw Witkiewicz and Franciszek MƒÖczy≈Ñski. The building is an example of a \\"brick-and-stone\\" variety of Zakopane style architecture. The design was prepared in 1913, and the building started between 1913 and 1914. Count W≈Çadys≈Çaw Zamoyski, a member of the Tatra Museum Society, donated the stones used for building. After the first world war, which had slowed the completion of building, the remaining works and preparations of exhibitions were possible thanks to a loan from Maria Sk≈Çodowska-Curie.  Collections and branches  Herbarium of Tatra Mosses by Tytus Cha≈Çubi≈Ñski, natural history collection of the Tatra Museum in Zakopane Villa Koliba Museum of Zakopane Style - a branch of the Tatra Museum in Zakopane Apart from the main branch in Zakopane, at Krup√≥wki Street 10, the museum has 7 other branches in Zakopane and 4 other branches, located in Czarna G√≥ra, Jurg√≥w, Chocho≈Ç√≥w and ≈Åopuszna. The museum holds and presents: * cultural and ethnographic artifacts, historical clothing, furniture, household objects, decorative objects, glass painting, and crafts; * natural history, flora and fauna of the Tatras; geological exhibits; * fine arts, mainly painting and sculpture created in the Podhale region. Besides the main branch, within Zakopane there are 11 branches of the Tatra Museum: * Villa Koliba Museum of Zakopane Style; * The W≈Çadys≈Çaw Hasior Gallery in Zakopane; * The Villa Oksza Gallery of 20th century art; * The Kornel Makuszy≈Ñski museum; * Art Gallery in Koziniec * The Museum of Zakopane Style - Inspirations in the Dembowski Villa.  Permanent exhibitions  = Historical exhibition = The 'white room', ethnographic exhibition 19th century Podhale corset, ethnographic collection of Tatra Museum The main building houses an exhibition presenting the history of the Polish Tatras. Photographs, archival documents and publications present a history of the Podhale region from prehistoric times, through first human settlements, the development of towns and villages, the development of Zakopane from a small village into a health resort and centre of the arts and culture in the interwar period. The exhibition presents the time of Zakopane's rapid development and the emergence of a society of active artists and social activists in Podhale at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. Tytus Cha≈Çubi≈Ñski, Stanis≈Çaw Witkiewicz and many other Polish artists had chosen Zakopane as their resort of choice, fascinated by the local folklore and nature. The exhibition traces further developments of the city and region until the present day. = Ethnographic exhibition = The ethnographic exhibition presents, among others, an interior of a typical 19th century Podhale cottage, with two spaces ‚Äì the \\"white\\" and \\"black\\" rooms separated by a vestibule. An original entrance door decorated with diagonal wooden pegs ‚Äì originally part of Stanis≈Çaw W√≥jciak‚Äôs house in Ko≈õcieliska ‚Äì was purchased by the museum in 1905 and now leads to the reconstruction of the cottage. The inside of the cottage presents the way of life of 19th century Podhale families. Daily life concentrated in the ‚Äòblack‚Äô chamber, its walls darkened by the smoke from the stove. Other exhibits include the historic clothing of Podhale Gorals and the arts and crafts. The Ethnographic department is the second-oldest in the museum and its ethnographic collection features approximately 10,750 items. Many enthusiasts of the culture of Podhale Gorals donated historical items and clothing to The Tatra Museum: Countess R√≥≈ºa Krasi≈Ñska, Bronis≈Çaw Dembowski, and Zygmunt Gnatowski. In 1949, after the Museum was nationalised, ethnographers were employed to acquire items missing from the already rich and valuable collection. The new acquisitions were mainly paintings and a large collection of glass painting, as well as folk sculpture and crafts, especially made of metal and leather. Many of these items are on display in the main building.

His first book was on the subject-matter of his dissertation, The Literature of Penance in Anglo-Saxon England (1983); he returned to the Anglo-Saxon penitential literature in Before the Closet: Same- Sex Love from 'Beowulf' to 'Angels in America (1998), in which, himself a gay man, he argues that contrary to John Boswell's argument, same-sex relations were not tolerated more by the Church before the Norman Conquest, but rather the relationships were not \\"closeted\\"; he takes what he calls a \\"legitimist\\" rather than a \\"liberationist\\" view of the textual evidence. The book has been described as \\"groundbreaking\\". Frantzen has also published critiques of the field of Old English studies: Desire for Origins: New Language, Old English, and Teaching the Tradition (1990), a study of the history of the field, and Speaking Two Languages: Traditional Disciplines and Contemporary Theory in Medieval Studies (1991). The former, in which Frantzen argues that Anglo-Saxon studies are increasingly regarded as hidebound because of the insular approach within the field, attracted much notice. Fred C. Robinson wrote that it \\"should be read by all medievalists who care about their profession.\\" In 1994 Frantzen was the keynote speaker at a conference at the University of California, Berkeley that was published as Anglo-Saxonism and the Construction of Social Identity (1997). In Bloody Good: Chivalry, Sacrifice, and the Great War (2004) he studied the mythology of chivalry and of imitatio Christi as motivations for participants in World War I. After his retirement, Frantzen wrote a blog post dated September 2015 titled \\"How to Fight Your Way Out of the Feminist Fog\\" in which he aligned himself with the men's rights movement against what he argued were the anti-man demands of feminists; this provoked disapproving responses from certain medievalists after it was publicized in early 2016. He has subsequently published Modern Masculinity: A Guide for Men (2016) via the self-publisher BookBaby.

She showed great promise as a two-year-old when winning the Prestige Stakes but failed to win or place in the following season when she made only three appearances. After a change of training stable she returned as a four-year-old ad reached her peak in the summer of 2015. She won the Duke of Cambridge Stakes at Royal Ascot and then recorded Group One victories in the Falmouth Stakes and the Prix Rothschild. She remained in training in 2016 but failed to win in five races and was retired at the end of the season. Background Amazing Maria is a grey mare bred in Ireland by her owner Sir Robert Ogden. Ogden is best known as an owner of National Hunt horses including See More Business, Voy Por Ustedes and Exotic Dancer. The filly was initially sent into training with Ed Dunlop at Newmarket, Suffolk. She was one of the first crop of foals of Mastercraftsman, which also included The Grey Gatsby and Kingston Hill. As a two-year-old Mastercraftsman won the Group 1 Phoenix Stakes and National Stakes and was crowned Cartier Champion Two-year-old Colt in 2008. As a three-year-old he went on to record victories in the Irish 2,000 Guineas and St. James's Palace Stakes before being retired to stud. Amazing Maria's dam Messias da Silva showed very modest racing ability, winning one minor race at Lingfield Park Racecourse in 2007 from six starts. She was descended from the American broodmare Wise Ally who was the ancestor of several other major winners including Alydeed and Fourstars Allstar. Racing career =2013: two-year-old season= Amazing Maria made her racecourse debut in a maiden race over seven furlongs at Newbury Racecourse on 25 June. Ridden by Frankie Dettori she started at odds of 6/1 and finished seventh, six and a quarter lengths behind the winner Gold Top. In July she was dropped in distance for a six furlong maiden at the same track and finished strongly to take third place behind J Wonder and Autumn Sunrise. On 1 August in a seven furlong maiden at Goodwood Racecourse she recorded her first success as she accelerated clear of her opponents in the last quarter mile and won by six lengths from Inchila despite being eased down by Dettori in the final strides. Twenty-three days over the same course and distance Amazing Maria was stepped up in class for the Group Three Prestige Stakes in which she was ridden by the French jockey Gerald Mosse. She was made the 6/4 favourite ahead of six opponents headed by Midnite Angel (runner-up in the Sweet Solera Stakes) and Qawaasem (runner-up in the Star Stakes). She took the lead from the start, went clear of the field in the last quarter mile and never looked in danger of defeat, winning by two and a half lengths from Qawaasem. Dunlop commented \\"I think the ground looks a bit slower than she wanted but she did it well. We've always thought the world of her and we will enjoy today. We'll see how she is but we'll have to think about the Fillies' Mile\\". =2014: three-year-old season= Amazing Maria was expected to return in the 2014 1000 Guineas but was withdrawn from the race after showing signs of having contracted a respiratory infection. She made her first appearance for nine months in The Oaks over one and a half miles 6 June in which she finished tailed-off last of the seventeen runners behind Taghrooda. She was then dropped in class and distance when she was sent to France for the Group Three Prix de Lieurey over 1600 metres at Deauville Racecourse in August but after leading for most of the way she faded badly in the closing stages and finished eleventh of the twelve runners behind Bawina. The Sceptre Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse in September as she started a 25/1 outsider and finished unplaced. At the end of the year, Amazing Maria left Dunlop's yard and joined the stable of David O'Meara at Upper Helmsley in North Yorkshire. =2015: four-year-old season= On her first appearance for her new trainer Amazing Maria carried a weight of 136 pounds in a handicap race over one mile at Ascot Racecourse on 9 May and finished third behind Temptress (129 pounds) and Solar Magic (135). Two weeks later she was sent to Ireland for the Group Two Lanwades Stud Stakes at the Curragh Racecourse and stayed on well in the closing stages to take third place behind the odds-on favourite Brooch. On 17 June at Royal Ascot Amazing Maria, ridden by James Doyle, started a 25/1 outsider in a six-runner field for the Duke of Cambridge Stakes over the straight mile course. Integral started favourite ahead of Rizeena, Cladocera (The Balanchine) and Bragging (Dahlia Stakes), with the only other runner being Lightning Thunder (runner-up in the 1000 Guineas). After being restrained towards of the rear of the field, she moved into second place approaching the final furlong before overtaking Rizeena and drawing away in the last 100 yards to win by two lengths. After the race Doyle commented \\"It was a funny race, we went a slow pace early and then dashed in the last two furlongs. I thought the ground might be a bit quick but she quickened up well\\". O'Meara explained \\"We‚Äôve ended up with a nice filly. \\"She came to Ascot on her first run for me but probably hit the front a little soon, we didn‚Äôt know her that well. Then she ran on soft ground, which we thought she‚Äôd like, but she's shown today she obviously wants it faster\\". Amazing Maria was stepped back up to Group One class for the Falmouth Stakes over one mile at Newmarket Racecourse in which she was again ridden by Doyle. The 1000 Guineas runner-up Lucida started favourite ahead of Avenir Certain, Bawina and Fintry (Prix Bertrand du Breuil) with Amazing Maria next in the betting on 17/2. The other two runners were Arabian Queen and the Beverly D. Stakes winner Euro Charline. The grey filly was held up towards the rear, before being switched left by Doyle to make her challenge approaching the last quarter mile. Euro Charline took the lead from Arabian Queen a furlong out but Amazing Maria gained the advantage in the last 100 yards and won by a length, with Euro Charline getting the best of a five-way photo-finish for second place. Doyle said \\"A lot of people thought it might have been a fluke at Ascot, but I could only say what I felt on the day and I felt she was a class filly. I didn't want today to get away from that, so I rode her with plenty of confidence and I knew at halfway it was a game of cat and mouse as we were going real steady. I knew if I got first jump on them, she's honest and would hit the line well.\\" O'Meara commented \\"She traveled well today and moved to within a striking position quite easily for James. When he went for her, she found plenty. I suppose the Prix Rothschild would be the obvious race for her.\\" Olivier Peslier took over from Doyle on 2 August when Amazing Maria, as predicted, was sent to France for the Group One Prix Rothschild over 1600 metres at Deauville Racecourse and started the 5.5/1 third choice in the betting behind Ervedya and Bawina. The other five runners were Rizeena, Fintry, the unbeaten three- year-old Usherette, Odeliz (a Group Three winner in Germany) and Amulet. Amazing Maria raced in mid division before moving up into second place behind Avenir Certain 300 metres from the finish. She overtook the favourite 100 metres out and drew ahead to win by one and a quarter lengths. O'Meara commented \\"It's brilliant, she is obviously a very good filly. There was probably some doubt about whether she was truly a Group One filly after Royal Ascot, but she's done it again twice since then and you‚Äôd have to say she's among the best fillies in Europe now... there was no real plan going out. Olivier knows Deauville much better than me, I‚Äôve never had a runner here before. I just told him to go out and try and win.\\". In September Amazing Maria was sent to Ireland for the Matron Stakes at Leopardstown and started the 15/8 second favourite in a nine-runner field. She raced in third place but began to struggle approaching the last quarter mile and finished seventh behind Legatissimo. =2016: five-year-old season= Amazing Maria began her fourth campaign on 1 May in the Dahlia Stakes over nine furlongs at Newmarket in which she finished third of the nine runners behind Usherette and Arabian Queen. At Royal Ascot in June she started a 20/1 outsider for a strongly- contested edition of the Queen Anne Stakes and finished sixth behind Tepin, Belardo, Lightning Spear, Toormore and Ervedya. In July she attempted to repeat her 2015 success in the Falmouth Stakes but made little impact and finished last of the seven runners behind Alice Springs. In the Prix Rothschild she raced prominently and took the lead 400 metres out but was soon overtaken and finished sixth of the ten runners behind the three-year-old Qemah. On her final appearance the mare was dropped back to Group Two class for the Joel Stakes at Newmarket on 23 September and started at odds of 9/2 against five opponents. She raced in third place for most of the way but was unable to quicken in the final furlong and finished fourth behind the Aidan O'Brien-trained Cougar Mountain. Assessment and awards In the 2015 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Amazing Maria was given a rating of 117, making her the ninth best older female and the 97th best horse in the world. Breeding record Amazing Maria was retired from racing to become a broodmare for her owner's stud. Her first foal was a filly sired by Dubawi and named Amazing Grace.

Publication of binomial Peucedanum japonicum was described by Thunberg in 1784. Description P. japonicum has a stout umbellifer of 30‚Äì100 cm and is essentially glabrous. The stem is frequently flexuous. The leaf blade is broadly ovate-triangular. It size is 35 x 25 cm. It is thinly coriaceous, bearing 1-2 ternate(s). leaflets are ovate-orbicular, 3-parted, 7‚Äì9 cm broad and glaucous. Its central segments are obovate-cuneate, its lateral segments are oblique-ovate. Umbels are 4‚Äì10 cm across; bracts are either 2-3 or absent, ovate-lanceolate, 5-10 x circa 2mm, pubescent. It sports 15-30 rays of 1‚Äì5 cm, unequal and puberulous. It has 8-10 bracteoles, linear- lanceolate, equalling or longer than flowers. It hascirca 20-flowered umbellules. It has calyx teeth are obsolete. Petals are purple or white abaxially hispidulous. Its styles are short. The fruit is oblong-ovate or ellipsoid, to 6 x 4mm. It is hirsute, especially on dorsal ribs; its lateral ribs have very thick wings.Its vittae are small, with 3-5 in each furrow, 6-10 on commissure. They flower in June to July and fruit from August to September. Habitat The plant inhabits coastal areas and seashores below 100 meters, typically in soil found to be slightly acidic to mildly alkaline. Distribution P. japonicum can be found in the Chinese provinces of Fujian, Hong Kong, Jiangsu, Shandong, Taiwan and Zhejiang in addition to Japan, Korea and the Philippines.  Uses  = Korea = In Korea, the plant is usually referred to as bangpung () or bangpungnamul () although its official name is gaetgireumnamul (). In Korean cuisine, the leaves of coastal hog fennel are used fresh as ssam vegetable (for hoe) or pickled in soy sauce and vinegar to make jangajji. It can be used as a main ingredient in namul dishes, or added as a herb to soybean paste stew, starch jelly dishes, fritters and pancakes, noodle soups and dough soups, stir-fried glass noodles, rice, or even Korean- style Italian lasagne. File:Bangpung (Peucedanum japonicum).jpgBangpungnamul- muchim (seasoned coastal hogfennel leaves) File:Bangpung (Peucedanum japonicum) tteok for tteokguk.jpgCoastal hogfennel rice cakes for tteokguk (rice cake soup) = Japan = In Japan, peucedanum japonicum is also known as the longevity herb and long known to have medicinal properties. P. japonicum called chyou-mei-gusa, which translates to grass for longevity and is served in traditional Japanese dishes during shirayoi, the naming ceremony for a newborn, and yahnuyoi, celebration for the completion of a new house. Yonaguni Island produces over 90% of the herb's production in Okinawa and could become another significant medicinal crop for Okinawa, following turmeric and aloe. Cosmetics company Shiseido markets P. japonicum as a health food, Shiseido Longevity Herb, in the form of tablets, a powder and a drink. Okinawns have a longer lifespan and lower incidence of cancer compared to the Japanese mainland. Some believe this longevity to be due to dietary factors, however the exact reasons have yet to be verified. In ancient times, P. japonicum leaves and roots were used as a medicine treatment for patients with sore throat in the Ryukyu Islands. =China= People of China pronounce P. japonicum as bin hai qian hu (Êª®Êµ∑ÂâçËÉ°). Its older name was fang kui (Èò≤Ëëµ). > Feverish people should not take it because it causes one to be delirious and > see spirits. \\\\- Tao Hongjing (456-536 C.E.) - Taoist mediator of Maoshan and > follower of Ge Hong - writing in 510 C.E. In contrast to the Korean culinary uses listed above, the plant was considered in China to be medicinal but possibly deleterious to health and likely to cause delirium in those who consumed it in quantity: > Fang k'uei, if taken in excess, makes one become delirious and act somewhat > as though mad. Ch'en Yen-chih / Chen Yanzhi (Èô≥Âª∂‰πã) 5th Century C.E.c. 454-473 > C.E. Xiaoping fang (Â∞èÂìÅÊñπ \\"Minor Prescriptions\\") (tr. Li 1977: 168). The plant referred in Taoist alchemical texts may be referring to Saposhnikovia divaricata (syn. Siler divaricata - Schultes and Hofmann mention another putative hallucinogen with a role in Taoist alchemy) rather than P. japonicum. Taoist sage Tao Hongjing speaks of two kinds of fang-feng (which normally refers to Saposhnikovia in Chinese), noting : > The root is spicy and non-poisonous. The kind that bifurcates at the top > produces madness. The kind that bifurcates at the bottom causes reversion of > old ailments. 'Spicy and non-poisonous' accords well with the culinary use of P. japonicum in Korean cuisine, whereas 'bifurcates at the top' and 'produces madness' accords with the morphology and medicinal/toxic properties of S. divaricata. However, as fang k'uei, P. japonicum is definitely used for medicinal as well as culinary purposes in China, where it is employed as an 'eliminative', diuretic, tussive, sedative and tonic. Ming Dynasty pharmacologist Li Shizhen was likewise of the opinion that P. japonicum was, although medicinal, not toxic in itself, maintaining that the hallucinogenic properties of the drug were probably a result of its adulteration with material derived from Aconitum or Euphorbia species.Schultes, Richard Evans; Hofmann, Albert (1979).

He argued two of three cases before the Supreme Court of Canada that would eventually be considered a case law trilogy of personal injury cases for Canada. He also negotiated or litigated some of the largest personal injury awards in Canadian history. Early life and education Cummings grew up in the Boyle Street district on the east side of Edmonton in Alberta, Canada. He was raised with his father selling iron and steel products and his mother a bookkeeper for lumber companies. The house he lived in was small and he was forced to share a bedroom with his grandfather. Cummings attended the University of Alberta and worked odd jobs to pay his way through law school. Career After graduating from law school in 1960, Cummings began working for a large Edmonton law firm. He worked there for a year prior to moving to a smaller firm and eventually joining his partner firm. Cummings joined the law firm of Cummings Andrews Mackay in 1962. During his time with the firm he turned it from a solicitor office into a litigation firm, handling cases throughout the entire country and earning him the nickname \\"King of Torts.\\" Cummings also took a stance during his career to not represent insurance companies, instead only representing people who have been disabled by acts of negligence. Early in his career Cummings also specialized in divorce. He argued a case before the Supreme Court of Canada where the judge awarded his client lump sum alimony based on equity in the other party's residence. It was the first decision of its kind and one that is now studied in law schools throughout Canada. In 1978, Cummings argued two cases of a trilogy before the Supreme Court of Canada that set precedent for personal injury awards in Canada. He argued Andrews v. Grand & Toy Alberta Ltd. and Thornton v. Prince George School Board with the third being Arnold v Teno. Both cases involved large awards which were challenged by the defense. The result of the rulings was the raising of non-monetary damages that could be awarded in such cases. It also reversed 100 years of case law that determined awards based on a lump sum as opposed to itemized awards for pain and suffering and loss of future earnings. In the 1980-90s, Cummings litigated personal injury cases that became some of the largest structured settlement cases in Canada. Two such cases were the largest in the history of Alberta Court, with awards of $5 million and $2.9 million. Cummings tried a case in 1998 that resulted in the first ruling to use a pay-equity model. The judge awarded $4 million to the plaintiff calculated based on \\"the same salary level as a man had she not been injured.\\" Cummings was nominated for the Order of Canada, the second highest honour for merit in the system of orders, decorations, and medals of Canada. He retired from the firm in 2009 but remained on as a consultant. Personal life Cummings lives on a 40-acre estate southeast of Edmonton. He has two children and was married to Virginia Cummings until her death in 2007.

The remaining Mississippi lands ceded in the Treaty of Pontotoc Creek. The Treaty of Pontotoc Creek was a treaty signed on October 20, 1832 by representatives of the United States and the Chiefs of the Chickasaw Nation assembled at the National Council House on Pontotoc Creek, Mississippi. The treaty ceded the 6,283,804 million acres of the remaining Chickasaw homeland in Mississippi in return for Chickasaw relocation on an equal amount of land west of the Mississippi River. The treaty followed an earlier agreement to move west of the Mississippi in 1830 which the Chickasaw refused to honor after discovering the poor nature of the land they received. Pressured by the aggression of the State of Mississippi to establish its jurisdiction over the Indians, Chickasaw Chiefs relented in 1832 to President Andrew Jackson's and his representatives offer of relocation in the west. The land was ceded to the U.S. with the understanding that the proceeds made in the sale of the land to white settlers would go to the Chickasaw. The treaty led to the Chickasaw Trail of Tears, by which the entire Chickasaw Nation emigrated to new territory in present-day Oklahoma in 1837-1838.  Background  The treaty was part of the greater Indian Removal policy, originally proposed by President Thomas Jefferson, by which the Five Civilized Tribes were to allow for white settlement in the south by ceding their territory and relocating west of the Mississippi River. It was one of several removal treaties signed by the Muscogee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Cherokee in the 1830s relocating them to the new territories in present-day Oklahoma and Arkansas. The Chickasaw were essentially doomed to removal with the others, when, in 1806 Jefferson promised the southern states that the Federal Government would encourage the migration of all Indians to land west of the Mississippi. The other factor underlying the removal of the Indians was land speculation, one of the primary sources of money for the landed aristocracy of the South since the early days of the Virginia colony. The trio of Andrew Jackson, John Coffee and James Jackson (unrelated), were each land speculators, militiamen and politicians who worked the cessions of huge tracts of Indians lands, the defeat of Indian resistance and eventually the complete removal of the Chickasaw, as well as the rest of the Five Civilized Tribes, to make way for white settlers ‚Äìoften at great personal profit. = First attempts at removal: Treaties of 1805, 1816 and 1818 = A series of land cessions preceded this final cession of Chickasaw land at Pontotoc Creek. The Chickasaws made two significant cessions in 1805 and 1816, ceding their land in Alabama and Tennessee along the Tennessee River, the highly valued land along the Muscle Shoals rapids of the river. The cessions had made a great profit to Jackson, Coffee and James Jackson, the latter of whom built his magnificent Forks of Cypress Plantation on the ceded land in Florence, Alabama. In 1818 Jackson began his attempt to totally remove the Chickasaw in a treaty that ceded everything between the Tennessee River and the Mississippi. John C. Calhoun, President Monroe's Secretary of War, had told Jackson that \\"The President is very anxious to remove the Indians on this side to the west of the Mississippi, and if the Chickasaws could be brought to an exchange of territory, it would be preferred.\\" This land was very valuable on account of its fertile land and salt licks, and the Chickasaw were aware of this value. Jackson persuaded James Colbert and other Chickasaw chiefs to meet him at the Chickasaw Old Town (now Tupelo, Mississippi) to talk about the proposed cession. The Chickasaw were greatly influenced by the powerful chiefs James, George and Levi Colbert, landholding Chickasaw who had adopted some of the trappings of plantation society like owning slaves, and who supported removal to the west. With great difficulty, Jackson finally got the Chickasaw chiefs to give in with the promise of $20,000 paid annually to the chiefs for fifteen years. A deed was drawn up in the name of James Jackson, revealing the corrupt nature of these cessions later pointed out by Andrew Jackson's adversaries, and the Chickasaw lost everything north of the Mississippi border with Tennessee. Andrew Jackson achieved a massive land cession but not the total western removal that was wanted. The Chickasaw carefully guarded their remaining land until Jackson became President.  Treaty of Pontotoc Creek, 1832  After Jackson was elected President in 1828 he resolved to finish the drawn-out question of removal for good. The Indian Removal Act was passed in May, 1830, giving the President direct authority to negotiate the removal treaties for the Five Civilized Tribes still clinging to their southeastern homelands. = Treaty of Franklin, 1830 = After the act, Jackson received strong legal and judicial resistance from the more law-savvy Creeks and Cherokees, and the Choctaw Chief Greenwood LeFlore, furiously refused any meeting with the president. However, the Chickasaw agreed to meet him in Franklin Tennessee in the summer of 1830. By this point, the State of Mississippi had taken the same measures in dealing with the Chickasaw and Choctaw Indians as Georgia had with the Cherokee, essentially forbidding any exercise of tribal governance and extending state law over the Chickasaw Nation's borders. The Chickasaw came to Franklin to appeal to Jackson for Federal protection from Mississippi. Jackson, however, successfully talked the chiefs into removal after suggesting that by remaining in Mississippi, the Chickasaw would become subject to Mississippi law and their culture would be extinguished by the overwhelming white settlers. He said: \\"By becoming amalgamated with the whites your national character will be lost... you must disappear and be forgotten.\\" On August 27, 1830, after four days of deliberation, the Chickasaw chiefs agreed to exchange their land in Mississippi and relocate to the west. = Renegotiation and Pontotoc Creek = A Chickasaw delegation assigned to explore the new Chickasaw territory west of the Mississippi stalled removal, much to Jackson's distress, for another two years. They returned to the Mississippi Chickasaw and said that the new land was unacceptable for their people. The Senate refused to ratify the Franklin treaty and the Chickasaw refused to leave their territory in Mississippi. After enduring two more years of whites in Mississippi, however, and the devastating effects of whiskey and squatters on Chickasaw culture, and of Mississippi state law on Chickasaw tribal governance, the Chickasaw National Council assembled to meet John Coffee at the Council House on Pontotoc Creek on October 20, 1832 to sign a Treaty allowing for the sale of the Chickasaw Mississippi territory in exchange for the surveying of new lands in the west. The preamble written by the Chickasaw chiefs read: > The Chickasaw Nation find themselves oppressed in their present situation, > by being made subject to the laws of the States in which they reside. Being > ignorant of the laws of the white man, they cannot understand or obey them. > Rather than submit to this great evil, they prefer to seek a home in the > west, where they may live and be governed by their own laws. And believing > that they can procure for themselves a home, in a country suited to their > wants and condition, provided they had the means to contract and pay for the > same, they have determined to sell their country and hunt a new home. The > President has heard the complaints of the Chickasaws and like them believes > they cannot be happy, and prosper as a nation, in their present situation > and condition, and being desirous to relieve them from the great calamity > that seems to await them, if they remain as they are - He has sent his > Commissioner General John Coffee, who has met the whole Chickasaw nation in > Council, and after mature deliberation, they have entered into the following > articles... Although further complications had to be resolved, Arrell M. Gibson writes that the Pontotoc Creek Treaty \\"was the basic Chickasaw removal document providing for the cession of all tribal land east of the Mississippi River.\\" In the treaty, the Chickasaw land was ceded in return for the U.S. finding suitable land for resettlement ‚Äìrevealing the chiefs' desperation to regain Chickasaw sovereignty from the aggressions of the state of Mississippi. Chickasaw landholders were to be compensated for the improvements made on their lands, and all the proceeds made by the Federal government in the sale of the land were to be turned over to the Chickasaw to pay for finding new territory and the actual removal of the tribe. Unlike in other removal treaties, the Chickasaw would pay for their own migration. The treaty also provided for protection the Chickasaw in Mississippi until they emigrated with the allotment of \\"temporary homesteads.\\" This meant that the Chickasaws were allotted the land they were living on in Mississippi, to be protected by the Federal government from squatters; this benefit was not given to the Cherokee when later the Federal government relied on the influx of squatters in Georgia to pressure the Cherokee into removal.  Aftermath  Map showing the 1832 Chickasaw land cession of their territory in northern Mississippi and the land in Indian Territory acquired in the Treaty of Doaksville. Immediately following the treaty, unallotted Chickasaw land was quickly occupied by white settlers, although they were not supposed to enter, under the treaty, until the Chickasaw relocated. Between 1832 and 1837, the Chickasaw made several further negotiations, in part because of the reluctance of the Senate to confirm Pontotoc and in part because of the Chickasaws' dissatisfaction with finding new land. The Treaty of Washington in 1834 confirmed Pontotoc. In addition it allowed for the enlargement of the Chickasaw temporary homesteads to be sold, and guaranteed the right of the Chickasaw to receive the revenue for each improved homestead sold. The chiefs were concerned to make the best deal in terms of sale and of acquiring new land for the Chickasaw people. = Land in the West, Treaty of Doaksville 1837 = After Pontotoc, Chickasaw sent delegations to search for the new land in the Arkansas Territory, reaching an agreement with the Choctaw in 1837. The Chickasaw decided to buy a part of the Choctaw tribe's new western land under what became known as the Treaty of Doaksville for $530,000. Although the treaty was really between the two Indian nations, Andrew Jackson persuaded the Senate to ratify the treaty. Essentially, the Chickasaw had ceded their eastern land with the Treaty of Pontotoc Creek and acquired western land from the Choctaw in the Treaty of Doaksville.  Result: Chickasaw Trail of Tears  In 1837-38, with their western lands having been purchased from the Choctaw, 4,914 Chickasaws and their 1,156 slaves emigrated to the new, western Chickasaw Nation. They received over $3 million from the sales of the Mississippi allotments, but with this wealth incurred further external threats from white opportunists coming to the new Chickasaw territory as surveyors and salesmen. The Chickasaw trail of tears was the least traumatic of the removal journeys of any of the Five Civilized Tribes. It was achieved with relative success compared to the Choctaw or Cherokee, yet it still had damaging effects on tribal culture and structure which took decades to heal.

One such way was highlighted during Correctional Services Week 2016 (October 24‚Äì29), where the Minister stated that the offenders would be trained in farming techniques before they are released. Minister Charles toured the nation's correctional facilities in early April to examine the deficiencies and initiate the fast-tracking of modernization in the facilities. Other steps have been taken to transform the prison system from a place of punishment to a place of rehabilitation from partnerships with the Department, the Ministry, private sectors and international bodies.

While Paul isn't happy, he will accept it if it makes Val happy but Helen is adamantly against the interracial marriage and Julie isn't too keen on the idea either. Meanwhile, the Grant family is turned upside down when Paul and David are accused of stealing money from Anderson Manufacturing. Val comforts a concerned Helen after Paul nearly falls off the wagon and believes the stress of her impending nuptials to David has driven her dad over the edge.

Valerie tries to reconcile with Eli who avoids her until she confronts him and he forces her to tell Julie that he is David's son. Faced with rejection from her son, Val finds comfort with Abe. Development =Casting and creation= The role of Valerie was originated by actress Tina Andrews in 1975 on a recurring basis. In the summer of 1977, it was announced that Andrews would vacate the role of Valerie after two years to join the cast of the network's prime-time sitcom, Sanford Arms. On her departure from the role of Valerie, Andrews remarked \\"It's like having your child grow up and leave home. You know it's for the best but hard to accept.\\" In addition to collecting a regular salary, Andrews appreciated the advantages of working on the soap. \\"It was like a paid workshop. I kept my skills sharp.\\" Because she was not bound by a contract, \\"I can take another job whenever I want. I was just sure to give the show time enough to write my character out of the story for that time. Andrews and the producers were working on an arrangement for her to continue taping when she was available, but plans changed when the actress booked several television films. Andrews last appeared in the role of Valerie on July 22 and was replaced by Rose Fonseca on August 2; Fonseca was also on a recurring basis. Fonseca vacated the role in 1978, and last appeared on July 26. Actress Diane Sommerfield took over the role of Valerie on October 19, 1981 as a series regular. However, Sommerfield's tenure barely lasted a year and she last appeared on July 1, 1982. In April 2016, following the announcement that the series had once again replaced their head writers, a casting call was released for the character of Valerie. The producers were looking for an experienced actress to step into the role by late May 2016. In October 2016, several media outlets reported that former Melrose Place actress Vanessa A. Williams had been cast in the role of Valerie; she made her first appearance on October 25. In an interview with Soap Opera Digest, Williams revealed that she'd auditioned for the show several times -- but \\"guest-star and recurring roles.\\" And when the casting call for the role of Valerie went out, \\"Marnie [Saitta, casting director] already knew my work\\" the actress said. \\"I think there was enough tape on me that it was basically an interview.\\" From there, Williams went straight to work. \\"Oh my God, it was trial by fire,\\" Williams exclaimed. She had not worked on a soap since she had a bit role on Another World in New York. \\"It was so different than how we do it.\\" She continued, \\"It reminded me of working in theater\\" as there was very little time to rehearse. =Early storylines= Valerie was created as the Black love interest for Richard Guthrie's David Banning in 1975. To help with the writing for \\"America's first and foremost Daytime TV interracial romance,\\" the producers recruited Black script writer, Wanda Coleman to help pen the story. The romance developed \\"oh so slowly\\" with the duo barely ever touching until their first kiss in 1976. Actress Tina Andrews, who originated the role of Valerie, relished in challenging the \\"taboo\\" and \\"reflecting life as it really is.\\" Despite viewer backhlash, Andrews pushed for David and Valerie's eventual marriage and hoped the two would start a family. She insisted, \\"if you are doing a soap and want to be slightly scandalous then do it right.\\" When David proposes to Valerie in the summer of 1976, Valerie wants to take time to consider it. In actuality, the writers believed they could wait for viewers to come around. As of the summer of 1977, Valerie and David were engaged and Andrews believed the two would eventually marry. But when fan response did not change, the writers chose to end the romance. Andrews was very upset when she was informed of the storyline decision. In story, David cheats on Valerie with Trish Clayton, and she breaks it off with him upon learning that Trish is pregnant. David marries Trish and Valerie is written out having received a scholarship to Howard University's College of Medicine. Andrews, at the time was in negotiations with the producers to get Valerie back on canvas when she booked Sanford which led to the recast. When Pat Falken Smith was rehired as head writer in 1981, one of the first moves was to bring Valerie back to the canvas with Diane Sommerfield in the role. However, David (Gregg Marx) and Valerie's romance was not revisited. The two remain friends even when she helps him hide from the law. Instead, Valerie becomes involved with Detective Abe Carver (James Reynolds). Their romance is plagued by Valerie's maintained friendship with David and the danger Abe faces in his work. = Return (2016) = It was reported that Valerie, now a respected cardiologist, would return to tend to her former flame, Abe Carver, who had recently been shot. In addition, Valerie's return puts her in story with Abe's teenage son, Theo (Kyler Pettis). The actress also had to learn medical terminology and credits co-star Evans, who plays Kayla Brady, with helping Williams step into the doctor role. Williams said: \\"It will be very intriguing to see [Valerie] interacting with Abe.\\" According to Williams, \\"Valerie's a professional. She's sharp and knows her stuff, but at same time, she also has a little mystery to her.\\" In the summer of 2016, the series released a casting call for the recurring role of the African-American Levi. In December 2016, reports surfaced with claims that the character of Levi would be Valerie's son which led to speculation that David was the man's father, making him a member of show's core family, the Hortons. Meanwhile, it was announced the Lamon Archey had joined the cast in an unnamed role and was slated to debut in early 2017. On December 11, 2016, Seaforth Hayes announced Archey's casting in a video interview with the actor and revealed that he would portray Julie's grandson, Eli Grant.

Its music is a mix of new wave, pop, and punk rock.  Biography  = First album = Created from the ashes of Chicoutimi band Les Horn Abbots, led by Xavier Th√©riault and JC Tellier, Gazoline officially exists since 2012, with the release of the EP Futurbabymama. Working with Quebec punk rock icon Xavier Cafe√Øne as a producer, the musicians got significant media attention with this first production, taking them to the second place of the famous francophone contest Francouvertes 2012. After several noteworthy appearances in all major festivals in Quebec, Gazoline released its first full-length album Gazoline in March 2014, on the record label L-Abe. This new album threw the band in front of the French Canadian music scene, gaining a prized nomination in the category \\"Rock Album of the Year\\" at the 2014 ADISQ Gala as well as \\"Emerging french artist of the year\\" at the Sirius XM Awards of 2013. Radio hit singles like Ces gens qui dansent and Du feu helped Gazoline reach a bigger audience, being featured in Quebecois prime-time shows such as Hockey Night in Canada, Tout le monde en parle, La Voix, Belle et bum and more. = Br√ªlensemble = After a large Canadian tour and more than 300 shows, the young musicians went back in studio for the creation of their second album, Br√ªlensemble.

Clearly distinct from the sounds of their first album, Br√ªlensemble showcases a somewhat less juvenile approach, mixing new wave and 80's influences in the punk rock roots of Gazoline. The aid of famed composer Julien Mineau (Malajube, Fontarabie) as producer surely helped finding this new direction. \\"Br√ªlensemble\\" was nominated at the ADISQ Gala in 2017 in the Rock Album of the Year Category, as well as for the SOCAN Songwriting Prize. = Y≈´gen = The band took a surprising turn in 2017, exactly one year after \\"Br√ªlensemble\\", with the release of \\"Y≈´gen\\", a five songs EP with an heavy electro synth pop feel.

He grew up in his native country, with both his parents and his brother. He studied medicine in Belgrade.  Biography  In 1963, he settled in Paris, France. He began his medical studies again, his Yugoslav diploma not being recognized. He then became an anesthetist-reanimator. In 1967, the Biafran war began as a result of the secession of the eastern region of Nigeria, which proclaimed itself the Republic of Biafra. With government troops carrying out a land and sea blockade, the region was plunged into famine, resulting in an estimated one to two million deaths. This war was widely publicized at the international level, which will push doctors to go and help the refugees. He then went on a mission with other French doctors: Marcel Delcourt, Max Recamier, G√©rard Pigeon, Bernard Kouchner, Raymond Borel, Jean Cabrol, Jean-Michel Wild, Pascal Grellety Bosviel, Jacques B√©r√©s, G√©rard Illiouz, Philippe Bernier, , and Louis Schittly. This war was at the origin of the foundation of M√©decins sans fronti√®res in 1971. On the occasion of Operation \\"A Boat for Vietnam\\" in 1979, Bernard Kouchner wanted to charter a boat with doctors and journalists to testify to the violations of Human Rights in that country. He also wanted to evacuate the Vietnamese who had fled their communist country. There was a violent quarrel at the origin of a split within the management of MSF who considered the operation too media oriented. Bernard Kouchner then left MSF definitively and created the organization M√©decins du monde with fifteen other doctors in 1980.

Many of the terrorist acts were carried out outside Yugoslavia against Yugoslav subjects. The post-war period until circa 1985 was marked by frequent terrorist attacks on Yugoslav institutions organized by extremist emigrant organizations. In that period, 20 Yugoslav ambassadors and officials were killed abroad. 22 instances of terrorist groups entering Yugoslavia were recorded, 87 mine and bomb explosions, and 13 cases of arson (including also abroad, mainly in embassies and diaspora clubs). Also, 62 cases of armed and physical attacks on Yugoslav institutions and citizens in which there were no casualties were recorded. Four plane hijackings by Yugoslav emigrants. Perpetrators were predominantly Croat fascists (Ustashe). According to Yugoslav government data, between 1945 and September 1985 there were 657 anti- Yugoslav terrorist acts abroad carried out by 'enemy' emigre, in which 82 Yugoslavs (and three foreigners) were killed, and 186 Yugoslavs (and two foreigners) were wounded. In Yugoslavia, more than 40 terrorist acts were carried out, and 60 attempted, in which 30 were killed and 73 wounded. Notably, in Australia, where two Croat extremist organizations (HRB and HOP) were active, 33 anti-Yugoslav acts were carried out, while three were carried out in Yugoslavia. Socialist Yugoslavia =Ustashe terrorism= Ustashe terrorism continued over the years after Ante Paveliƒá's death. The Croatian Liberation Movement (HOP) conducted several assassinations and attacks on Yugoslav diplomacy and JAT representations in Australia. Between 1962 and 1982, Croatian nationalists carried out 128 terror attacks against Yugoslav civilian and military targets. Croat fascist and HSO member Miljenko Hrkaƒá carried out the bombing of a Belgrade cinema in September 1968, leaving one dead and 85 wounded. In 1969, two Yugoslav diplomats in Western Germany were shot and wounded by Ustashe assassins. In 1970, Yugoslav secretary Vladimir Roloviƒá handed over information on Ustashe and their involvement in terrorist actions to the Australian government (which had tolerated and even trained the Ustashe). The following year, two Ustashe youngsters murdered Roloviƒá while he was the ambassador to Sweden. In January 1972, a JAT plane was bombed by Ustashe agents. The crackdown on the Croatian leadership led to heightened anti-Yugoslav activity by Croat emigrant groups. On 29 March 1972 a Yugoslav tourist office was bombed in Stockholm.Central Intelligence Bulletin, Central Intelligence Agency. 30 March 1972. The last members of the Bugojno group were captured, tried and sentenced on 21 December 1972. =Chetnik terrorism= In 1975, Nikola Kavaja, a diaspora Chetnik-sympathizer living in Chicago and belonging to the Serbian National Defense Council (SNDC), was, at his own initiative, responsible for bombing a Yugoslav consul's home, the first in a series of attacks targeting the Yugoslav state in the United States and Canada. He and his co-conspirators were captured in a sting set up by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and convicted for terrorism for the incident and for planning to bomb two Yugoslav receptions on Yugoslavia's National Day. Later that year, during his flight to receive his sentence, he hijacked the American Airlines Flight 293 with the intention of crashing the plane into Tito's Belgrade headquarters, but was dissuaded; he ultimately received a 67-year prison sentence.

Wilhelmina Godfrey died on May 13, 1994 in Buffalo, New York.  Education  Wilhelmina Godfrey attended Fosdick Masten Park High School in Buffalo, where she took all the art classes that the school offered. Her schooling was interrupted by the Great Depression. She was able to continue her education in the 1940s after she received scholarships from the Art Institute of Buffalo and the Albright Art School of the Buffalo Fine Arts Academy, from which she graduated in 1949.Evans-Tibbs Collection, Artist file: Godfrey, Wilhelmina. National Gallery of Art Library, Washington D.C. In 1962, Godfrey completed studies in weaving at the Rochester Institute of Technology School for American Craftsmen.  Career  Godfrey began her career as a painter and printmaker, later creating artworks in fiber beginning in the early 1960s. She actively promoted community arts efforts in western New York. In 1951, she organized and taught drawing and painting classes at the YMCA on Michigan Ave in Buffalo. She also organized and taught art classes at Buffalo's St. Philip's Episcopal Church community center. From 1952 to 1963 Godfrey worked for AM&A;'s department store as an artist, but in 1963 she left to focus on her art. Godfrey's early paintings depict the lives of Buffalo's east side residents. In 1958, after being inspired by an exhibition in Rochester, New York, she started weaving and began to create sculptures in fiber. She organized the University at Buffalo's weaving program, and from 1967 to 1970, she taught at its Creative Craft Center. Godfrey founded the Langston Hughes Center for the Visual and Performing Arts (later renamed the Langston Hughes Institute) along with fellow artists, Jim Pappas, Allie Anderson, Clarence Scott, and Hal Franklin. In 1974, Godfrey received a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts and a scholarship from Haystack Mountain School of Crafts. Godfrey's textile works were abstract and often included motifs inspired by African art. In 1977, she wrote that she was exploring \\"the influence of Africa on the black-American craftspeople working in the United States today.\\" Two years later, in 1979, she presented at the National African American Crafts Conference Symposium on \\"The Negro Slave Crafts Workers of North and South Carolina.\\" Godfrey was commissioned to create artworks for St. Philip's Episcopal Church and Buffalo's St. Matthew's Episcopal Church.In 1990, Godfrey received the Individual Artist Within the Community Award from the Buffalo and Erie County Arts Council. In this same year, she exhibited at Medaille College. In 1994, the Burchfield Penney Arts Center acquired her painting City Playground for its permanent collection. Three additional Godfrey works are included in the Burchfield Penney's permanent collection: Untitled (#22), Sint Maarten, and Face Fetish.\\"Artwork.\\" Burchfield Penney Art Center at SUNY Buffalo State.

Specifically, AI is the ability of computer algorithms to approximate conclusions without direct human input. What distinguishes AI technology from traditional technologies in health care is the ability to gain information, process it and give a well-defined output to the end-user. AI does this through machine learning algorithms and deep learning. These algorithms can recognize patterns in behavior and create their own logic. In order to reduce the margin of error, AI algorithms need to be tested repeatedly. AI algorithms behave differently from humans in two ways: (1) algorithms are literal: if you set a goal, the algorithm can't adjust itself and only understand what it has been told explicitly, (2) and some deep learning algorithms are black boxes; algorithms can predict with extreme precision, but not the cause or the why. The primary aim of health-related AI applications is to analyze relationships between prevention or treatment techniques and patient outcomes. AI programs have been developed and applied to practices such as diagnosis processes, treatment protocol development, drug development, personalized medicine, and patient monitoring and care. Medical institutions such as The Mayo Clinic, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and the British National Health Service, have developed AI algorithms for their departments. Large technology companies such as IBM and Google, have also developed AI algorithms for healthcare. Additionally, hospitals are looking to AI software to support operational initiatives that increase cost saving, improve patient satisfaction, and satisfy their staffing and workforce needs. Companies are developing predictive analytics solutions that help healthcare managers improve business operations through increasing utilization, decreasing patient boarding, reducing length of stay and optimizing staffing levels. History Research in the 1960s and 1970s produced the first problem-solving program, or expert system, known as Dendral. While it was designed for applications in organic chemistry, it provided the basis for a subsequent system MYCIN, considered one of the most significant early uses of artificial intelligence in medicine. MYCIN and other systems such as INTERNIST-1 and CASNET did not achieve routine use by practitioners, however. The 1980s and 1990s brought the proliferation of the microcomputer and new levels of network connectivity. During this time, there was a recognition by researchers and developers that AI systems in healthcare must be designed to accommodate the absence of perfect data and build on the expertise of physicians. Approaches involving fuzzy set theory, Bayesian networks, and artificial neural networks, have been applied to intelligent computing systems in healthcare. Medical and technological advancements occurring over this half-century period that have enabled the growth healthcare-related applications of AI include: * Improvements in computing power resulting in faster data collection and data processing * Growth of genomic sequencing databases * Widespread implementation of electronic health record systems * Improvements in natural language processing and computer vision, enabling machines to replicate human perceptual processes * Enhanced the precision of robot-assisted surgery * Improvements in deeplearning techniques and data logs in rare diseases  Current research  Various specialties in medicine have shown an increase in research regarding AI. = Radiology = The ability to interpret imaging results with radiology may aid clinicians in detecting a minute change in an image that a clinician might accidentally miss. A study at Stanford created an algorithm that could detect pneumonia at that specific site, in those patients involved, with a better average F1 metric (a statistical metric based on accuracy and recall), than the radiologists involved in that trial. Several companies (icometrix, QUIBIM, Robovision, ...) have popped up that offer AI platforms for uploading images to. There are also vendor-neutral systems like UMC Utrecht's IMAGR AI. These platforms are trainable through deep learning to detect a wide range of specific diseases and disorders. The radiology conference Radiological Society of North America has implemented presentations on AI in imaging during its annual meeting. The emergence of AI technology in radiology is perceived as a threat by some specialists, as the technology can achieve improvements in certain statistical metrics in isolated cases, as opposed to specialists. = Screening = Recent advances have suggested the use of AI to describe and evaluate the outcome of maxillo-facial surgery or the assessment of cleft palate therapy in regard to facial attractiveness or age appearance. In 2018, a paper published in the journal Annals of Oncology mentioned that skin cancer could be detected more accurately by an artificial intelligence system (which used a deep learning convolutional neural network) than by dermatologists. On average, the human dermatologists accurately detected 86.6% of skin cancers from the images, compared to 95% for the CNN machine. In January 2020 researchers demonstrate an AI system, based on a Google DeepMind algorithm, that is capable of surpassing human experts in breast cancer detection. In July 2020 it was reported that an AI algorithm by the University of Pittsburgh achieves the highest accuracy to date in identifying prostate cancer, with 98% sensitivity and 97% specificity. = Psychiatry = In psychiatry, AI applications are still in a phase of proof-of-concept. Areas where the evidence is widening quickly include chatbots, conversational agents that imitate human behaviour and which have been studied for anxiety and depression. Challenges include the fact that many applications in the field are developed and proposed by private corporations, such as the screening for suicidal ideation implemented by Facebook in 2017. Such applications outside the healthcare system raise various professional, ethical and regulatory questions. = Primary Care = Primary care has become one key development area for AI technologies. AI in primary care has been used for supporting decision making, predictive modelling, and business analytics. Despite the rapid advances in AI technologies, general practitioners' view on the role of AI in primary care is very limited‚Äìmainly focused on administrative and routine documentation tasks. = Disease Diagnosis = There are many diseases and there also many ways that AI has been used to efficiently and accurately diagnose them. Some of the diseases that are the most notorious such as Diabetes, and Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) which are both in the top ten for causes of death worldwide have been the basis behind a lot of the research/testing to help get an accurate diagnosis. Due to such a high mortality rate being associated with these diseases there have been efforts to integrate various methods in helping get accurate diagnosis‚Äô. An article by Jiang, et al. (2017) demonstrated that there are several types of AI techniques that have been used for a variety of different diseases. Some of these techniques discussed by Jiang, et al. include: Support vector machines, neural networks, Decision trees, and many more. Each of these techniques is described as having a ‚Äútraining goal‚Äù so ‚Äúclassifications agree with the outcomes as much as possible‚Ä¶‚Äù. To demonstrate some specifics for disease diagnosis/classification there are two different techniques used in the classification of these diseases include using ‚ÄúArtificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Bayesian Networks (BN)‚Äù. From a review of multiple different papers within the timeframe of 2008-2017 observed within them which of the two techniques were better. The conclusion that was drawn was that ‚Äúthe early classification of these diseases can be achieved developing machine learning models such as Artificial Neural Network and Bayesian Network.‚Äù Another conclusion Alic, et al. (2017) was able to draw was that between the two ANN and BN that ANN was better and could more accurately classify diabetes/CVD with a mean accuracy in ‚Äúboth cases (87.29 for diabetes and 89.38 for CVD). = Telehealth = The increase of telemedicine, has shown the rise of possible AI applications. The ability to monitor patients using AI may allow for the communication of information to physicians if possible disease activity may have occurred. A wearable device may allow for constant monitoring of a patient and also allow for the ability to notice changes that may be less distinguishable by humans. = Electronic health records = Electronic health records are crucial to the digitalization and information spread of the healthcare industry. However, logging all of this data comes with its own problems like cognitive overload and burnout for users. EHR developers are now automating much of the process and even starting to use natural language processing (NLP) tools to improve this process. One study conducted by the Centerstone research institute found that predictive modeling of EHR data has achieved 70‚Äì72% accuracy in predicting individualized treatment response at baseline. Meaning using an AI tool that scans EHR data. It can pretty accurately predict the course of disease in a person. = Drug Interactions = Improvements in natural language processing led to the development of algorithms to identify drug-drug interactions in medical literature. Drug-drug interactions pose a threat to those taking multiple medications simultaneously, and the danger increases with the number of medications being taken. To address the difficulty of tracking all known or suspected drug-drug interactions, machine learning algorithms have been created to extract information on interacting drugs and their possible effects from medical literature. Efforts were consolidated in 2013 in the DDIExtraction Challenge, in which a team of researchers at Carlos III University assembled a corpus of literature on drug-drug interactions to form a standardized test for such algorithms. Competitors were tested on their ability to accurately determine, from the text, which drugs were shown to interact and what the characteristics of their interactions were. Researchers continue to use this corpus to standardize the measurement of the effectiveness of their algorithms. Other algorithms identify drug-drug interactions from patterns in user-generated content, especially electronic health records and/or adverse event reports. Organizations such as the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and the World Health Organization's VigiBase allow doctors to submit reports of possible negative reactions to medications. Deep learning algorithms have been developed to parse these reports and detect patterns that imply drug-drug interactions. = Creation of new drugs = DSP-1181, a molecule of the drug for OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder) treatment, was invented by artificial intelligence through joint efforts of Exscientia (British start-up) and Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma (Japanese pharmaceutical firm). The drug development took a single year, while pharmaceutical companies usually spend about five years on similar projects. DSP-1181 was accepted for a human trial. In September 2019 Insilico Medicine reports the creation, via artificial intelligence, of six novel inhibitors of the DDR1 gene, a kinase target implicated in fibrosis and other diseases. The system, known as Generative Tensorial Reinforcement Learning (GENTRL), designed the new compounds in 21 days, with a lead candidate tested and showing positive results in mice. The same month Canadian company Deep Genomics announces that its AI-based drug discovery platform has identified a target and drug candidate for Wilson's disease. The candidate, DG12P1, is designed to correct the exon-skipping effect of Met645Arg, a genetic mutation affecting the ATP7B copper-binding protein.  Industry  The subsequent motive of large based health companies merging with other health companies, allow for greater health data accessibility. Greater health data may allow for more implementation of AI algorithms. A large part of industry focus of implementation of AI in the healthcare sector is in the clinical decision support systems. As the amount of data increases, AI decision support systems become more efficient. Numerous companies are exploring the possibilities of the incorporation of big data in the health care industry. The following are examples of large companies that have contributed to AI algorithms for use in healthcare: * IBM's Watson Oncology is in development at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Cleveland Clinic. IBM is also working with CVS Health on AI applications in chronic disease treatment and with Johnson & Johnson on analysis of scientific papers to find new connections for drug development. In May 2017, IBM and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute began a joint project entitled Health Empowerment by Analytics, Learning and Semantics (HEALS), to explore using AI technology to enhance healthcare. * Microsoft's Hanover project, in partnership with Oregon Health & Science University's Knight Cancer Institute, analyzes medical research to predict the most effective cancer drug treatment options for patients. Other projects include medical image analysis of tumor progression and the development of programmable cells. * Google's DeepMind platform is being used by the UK National Health Service to detect certain health risks through data collected via a mobile app. A second project with the NHS involves analysis of medical images collected from NHS patients to develop computer vision algorithms to detect cancerous tissues. * Tencent is working on several medical systems and services. These include AI Medical Innovation System (AIMIS), an AI-powered diagnostic medical imaging service; WeChat Intelligent Healthcare; and Tencent Doctorwork * Intel's venture capital arm Intel Capital recently invested in startup Lumiata which uses AI to identify at-risk patients and develop care options. * Kheiron Medical developed deep learning software to detect breast cancers in mammograms. * Fractal Analytics has incubated Qure.ai which focuses on using deep learning and AI to improve radiology and speed up the analysis of diagnostic x-rays. Digital consultant apps like Babylon Health's GP at Hand, Ada Health, AliHealth Doctor You, KareXpert and Your.MD use AI to give medical consultation based on personal medical history and common medical knowledge. Users report their symptoms into the app, which uses speech recognition to compare against a database of illnesses. Babylon then offers a recommended action, taking into account the user's medical history. Entrepreneurs in healthcare have been effectively using seven business model archetypes to take AI solution to the marketplace. These archetypes depend on the value generated for the target user (e.g. patient focus vs. healthcare provider and payer focus) and value capturing mechanisms (e.g. providing information or connecting stakeholders). IFlytek launched a service robot ‚ÄúXiao Man‚Äù, which integrated artificial intelligence technology to identify the registered customer and provide personalized recommendations in medical areas. It also works in the field of medical imaging. Similar robots are also being made by companies such as UBTECH (\\"Cruzr\\") and Softbank Robotics (\\"Pepper\\"). The Indian startup Haptik recently developed a WhatsApp chatbot which answers questions associated with the deadly coronavirus in India. Implications The use of AI is predicted to decrease medical costs as there will be more accuracy in diagnosis and better predictions in the treatment plan as well as more prevention of disease. Other future uses for AI include Brain-computer Interfaces (BCI) which are predicted to help those with trouble moving, speaking or with a spinal cord injury. The BCIs will use AI to help these patients move and communicate by decoding neural activates. As technology evolves and is implemented in more workplaces, many fear that their jobs will be replaced by robots or machines. The U.S. News Staff (2018) writes that in the near future, doctors who utilize AI will ‚Äúwin out‚Äù over the doctors who don't. AI will not replace healthcare workers but instead, allow them more time for bedside cares. AI may avert healthcare worker burn out and cognitive overload. Overall, as Quan-Haase (2018) says, technology ‚Äúextends to the accomplishment of societal goals, including higher levels of security, better means of communication over time and space, improved health care, and increased autonomy‚Äù (p. 43). As we adapt and utilize AI into our practice we can enhance our care to our patients resulting in greater outcomes for all. Expanding care to developing nations With an increase in the use of AI, more care may become available to those in developing nations. AI continues to expand in its abilities and as it is able to interpret radiology, it may be able to diagnose more people with the need for fewer doctors as there is a shortage in many of these nations. The goal of AI is to teach others in the world, which will then lead to improved treatment and eventually greater global health. Using AI in developing nations who do not have the resources will diminish the need for outsourcing and can use AI to improve patient care. For example, Natural language processing, and machine learning are being used for guiding cancer treatments in places such as Thailand, China, and India. Researchers trained an AI application to use NLP to mine through patient records, and provide treatment. The ultimate decision made by the AI application agreed with expert decisions 90% of the time. Regulation While research on the use of AI in healthcare aims to validate its efficacy in improving patient outcomes before its broader adoption, its use may nonetheless introduce several new types of risk to patients and healthcare providers, such as algorithmic bias, Do not resuscitate implications, and other machine morality issues. These challenges of the clinical use of AI has brought upon potential need for regulations. Currently no regulations exist specifically for the use of AI in healthcare. In May 2016, the White House announced its plan to host a series of workshops and formation of the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) Subcommittee on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. In October 2016, the group published The National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan, outlining its proposed priorities for Federally-funded AI research and development (within government and academia). The report notes a strategic R&D; plan for the subfield of health information technology is in development stages. The only agency that has expressed concern is the FDA. Bakul Patel, the Associate Center Director for Digital Health of the FDA, is quoted saying in May 2017. > ‚ÄúWe're trying to get people who have hands-on development experience with a > product's full life cycle. We already have some scientists who know > artificial intelligence and machine learning, but we want complementary > people who can look forward and see how this technology will evolve.‚Äù The joint ITU-WHO Focus Group on Artificial Intelligence for Health (FG-AI4H) has built a platform for the testing and benchmarking of AI applications in health domain. As of November 2018, eight use cases are being benchmarked, including assessing breast cancer risk from histopathological imagery, guiding anti-venom selection from snake images, and diagnosing skin lesions.

The tunnel crosses the Hayward Fault and carries water for 800,000 EBMUD customers. History The Claremont Tunnel was built in 1929. After the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989, EBMUD began studying the potential effect of a large seismic event along the Hayward Fault. In the worst-case scenario, slip along the fault would sever the tunnel, disrupting the water supply to approximately 50 to 70% (800,000) of EBMUD's customers for up to six months. In response, EBMUD approved a $189 million Seismic Improvement Plan in 1994, which included seismic upgrades to the Claremont Tunnel. Seismic upgrades began in 2004 and completed in 2007. Design The original tunnel connects the EBMUD treatment plant in Orinda with the distribution system west of the Oakland Hills. It featured a bore square with a mostly unreinforced concrete lining thick. At peak capacity, the tunnel can deliver . The tunnel crosses the Hayward Fault at a nearly perpendicular angle from its western portal, and creep along the fault resulted in an offset of by 2008. The maximum credible earthquake (magnitude 7.0) predicted in studies would cause an offset of . ResearchGate link For the seismic upgrade, a reinforced bypass tunnel was constructed across the Hayward Fault starting in 2004. The seismic upgrade also injected grout to improve contact between the 1929 concrete tunnel and the surrounding earth. For the bypass, first a access tunnel was bored into the fault zone. Next, the space for the long bypass tunnel was excavated using the New Austrian tunnelling method. A bypass tunnel was used to avoid disrupting service through the main tunnel and to minimize cost and time. The bypass tunnel is in diameter, except for a reinforced section crossing the fault, where it takes on an oval cross-section wide for a length of . In the reinforced section, the concrete liner of the tunnel is thick, instead of the thickness elsewhere in the bypass tunnel. The reinforced section was excavated by first boring two drifts to either side of the planned section. The space between the two drifts was excavated, and then the drifts were filled with concrete so that if the reinforced section breaks, the water will not wash out the dirt surrounding the tunnel. In the reinforced section, the reinforcement is weakened every along its length to allow the reinforced section to shear predictably in the event of a slip along the fault. The reinforced section is fitted with a steel carrier pipe thick with a inner diameter, capable of delivering . Up to an offset can be accommodated without breaking the pipe or losing water delivery. The bypass tunnel was designed by Jacobs Associates for EBMUD, and cost $38 million. It went into service on May 30, 2007. References Wilson, S.H., R.J. Caulfield, and D.F. Tsztoo. 2006.

Upon warming through the Verwey transition temperature (), the magnetite crystal lattice changes from a monoclinic structure insulator to the metallic cubic inverse spinel structure that persists at room temperature. The phenomenon is named after Evert Verwey, a Dutch chemist who first recognized, in the 1940s, the connection between the structural transition and the changes in the physical properties of magnetite. This was the first metal-insulator transition to be found.Dancing electrons solve a longstanding puzzle in the oldest magnetic material The Verwey transition is near in temperature, but distinct from, a magnetic isotropic point in magnetite, at which the first magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant changes sign from positive to negative. The temperature and physical expression of the Verwey transition are highly sensitive to the stress state of magnetite and the stoichiometry. Non-stoichiometry in the form of metal cation substitution or partial oxidation can lower the transition temperature or suppress it entirely.

The case was controversial and instigated community debate about freedom of speech.  Factual background  On 15 April 2009, The Herald Sun published an article authored by columnist Andrew Bolt in its print edition, entitled \\"It's so hip to be black\\", and republished the article on its website with the title \\"White is the new black\\". On 21 August 2009, a second article authored by Bolt was published in print and online entitled \\"White fellas in the black\\". Pat Eatock, a woman of Aboriginal descent, brought proceedings in the Federal Court against Bolt and the proprietor of The Herald Sun, The Herald & Weekly Times Pty Ltd, suing on her own behalf and on behalf of people like her who have a fairer, rather than darker skin, and who are recognised as Aboriginal persons in Australia. Eatock alleged that the two newspaper articles authored by Bolt conveyed offensive messages about fair-skinned Aboriginal people, by saying that they were not genuinely Aboriginal and were pretending to be Aboriginal so they could access benefits that are available to Aboriginal people. Eatock sought a declaration that the articles contravened section 18C of the RDA, an injunction preventing publication or republication of the articles, and an apology from the newspaper.  Relevant legislation  Section 18C of the RDA relevantly provided: > \\"(1) It is unlawful for a person to do an act, otherwise than in private, > if: ::(a) the act is reasonably likely, in all the circumstances, to offend, > insult, humiliate or intimidate another person or a group of people; and > ::(b) the act is done because of the race, colour or national or ethnic > origin of the other person or of some or all of the people in the group.\\" The exemption provision in section 18D relevantly provided: > \\"Section 18C does not render unlawful anything said or done reasonably and > in good faith: ::(a) in the performance, exhibition or distribution of an > artistic work; or ::(b) in the course of any statement, publication, > discussion or debate made or held for any genuine academic, artistic or > scientific purpose or any other genuine purpose in the public interest; or > ::(c) in making or publishing: :::(i) a fair and accurate report of any > event or matter of public interest; or :::(ii) a fair comment on any event > or matter of public interest if the comment is an expression of a genuine > belief held by the person making the comment.\\"  Decision  Justice Mordecai Bromberg found that the two articles authored by Bolt conveyed the following imputations: * That there are fair-skinned people in Australia with essentially European ancestry but with some Aboriginal descent, of which the identified individuals are examples, who are not sufficiently Aboriginal to be genuinely identifying as Aboriginal persons but who, motivated by career opportunities available to Aboriginal people or by political activism, have chosen to identify as Aboriginal; and * Fair skin colour indicates a person who is unlikely to be sufficiently Aboriginal to be genuinely identifying as an Aboriginal person. Justice Bromberg found that it was reasonably likely that an ordinary person within the group of fair-skinned Aboriginal persons would have been offended and insulted by the newspaper articles, in particular the challenge to the legitimacy of the identity of those individuals and the concentration on skin colour as the defining determinant of racial identity. In addition, Justice Bromberg found that it was reasonably likely that Eatock would be \\"humiliated and intimidated by her perception of the capacity of the articles to generate negative or confronting attitudes to her from others\\". Justice Bromberg found that the articles were written \\"because of the race, colour or ethnic origin of those people\\". As such, Justice Bromberg held that the publication of the two articles contravened section 18C of the RDA. Justice Bromberg held that the exemption provision in section 18D of the RDA did not apply, because the publications were \\"not done reasonably and in good faith\\" in the making or publishing of a fair comment or in the course of any statement, publication or discussion for a genuine purpose in the public interest. Bromberg said that the articles contained \\"erroneous facts, distortions of the truth and inflammatory and provocative language\\". Justice Bromberg also observed in passing: \\"The intrusion into freedom of expression is of no greater magnitude than that which would have been imposed by the law of defamation if the conduct in question and its impact upon the reputations of many of the identified individuals had been tested against its compliance with that law.\\"  Reaction to the decision  A variety of journalists and commentators took issue with the Federal Court's decision on the grounds that it restricted free speech on a matter of public interest, given Bolt's articles had addressed matters of public interest such as criteria for eligibility for public funds, money, jobs and prizes; but other journalists and commentators supported the case as an example of a legitimate restriction on freedom of expression. The political allegiance of the presiding judge to the Australian Labor Party has also been raised as an issue (Justice Bromberg had once stood for Labor pre-selection). Bolt himself described the decision as a \\"terrible day for free speech\\" in Australia and said it represented \\"a restriction on the freedom of all Australians to discuss multiculturalism and how people identify themselves. I argued then and I argue now that we should not insist on the differences between us but focus instead on what unites us as human beings.\\" Following the decision, in October 2011 Professor Adrienne Stone of Melbourne University supported the judgement and told the ABC radio Law Report program: \\"I think that there is an argument to say that people who've been subjected to this kind of insult, based on their race, especially since there are groups subject to historical disadvantage, are actually entitled to have the state intervene and say that there was an unlawful act here.\\" Legal philosopher Dale Smith of Monash University told the same program that he disagreed with the decision, saying \\"we should ensure freedom of expression, and then find other ways of protecting or promoting freedom from racial intolerance and prejudice that don't infringe upon people's freedom of speech.\\" Andrew Dodd, a former presenter of the ABC Media Report program, described the decision as \\"a slap in the face for freedom of expression... because I think it does curtail the extent to which we are able to talk freely about issues that are difficult to discuss, which may have a public interest component, and which concern minority groups.\\" ABC Radio presenter Daniel Browning, who had been named in one of Bolt's articles, said that he had felt \\"humiliated\\" and \\"professionally undermined\\" by the articles, and suggested the restriction on freedom of expression could be justified. In June 2013, trade unionist Paul Howes said in response to the case that he objected to the law for having \\"Orwellian\\" overtones and \\"I am concerned that people in some of the circles I mix, on my side of politics, increasingly seem to think that they should write, or invoke, or resurrect, laws that will shut Andrew Bolt up.\\" The ABC's Jonathan Holmes of Media Watch described Justice Bromberg's interpretation of the RDA, and his application of it to Bolt's columns, as \\"profoundly disturbing\\" because it reinforced concerns that section 18C creates \\"one particular area of public life where speech is regulated by tests that simply don't apply anywhere else, and in which judges - never, for all their pontifications, friends of free speech - get to do the regulating\\". In 2016, Labor Senator Kimberley Kitching, said she was \\"very surprised\\" when Justice Bromberg decided to hear the Bolt case, given that ‚ÄúHe was an active ALP person, he was active enough that he was in a faction, he ran for preselection... Obviously he would have had some views about [Andrew Bolt], and perhaps he was not the best person to hear [the] case.‚Äù Bromberg had run unsuccessfully for Labor preselection in Melbourne in 2001.

It is run commercially as Peppers Manor House. The house was built in 1878 by Henry Edward Kater and was the rural retreat for the Kater family for almost one hundred years. In 1984 it was renovated and major extensions were made to convert it to a hotel and conference centre. Early history The land surrounding Mount Broughton was originally granted to Dr Charles Throsby in 1822. Dr Throsby arrived in Sydney as a naval surgeon and later joined the famous explorer Hamilton Hume, a family friend in the exploration of the country around Sutton Forest. In 1818 he accompanied James Meehan on a journey from the Cowpastures through Moss Vale to Bundanoon Creek and south-east to Jervis Bay. Dr Throsby died in 1824 and as he had no children his nephew also called Charles Throsby inherited the land. He named it Mount Broughton after his wife Elizabeth Broughton. After his death in 1854 the land was inherited by his sons. In 1873 Oliver Spencer Throsby advertised the property for sale as the ‚ÄúMount Broughton Estate‚Äù. It was sold in 1874 and then sold again in 1878 to Henry Edward Kater. The Kater family Henry Edward Kater Henry Edward Kater (1841-1924) built a single story house on the Mount Broughton property in 1878 which was used by the family as a rural retreat and a small pastoral property. Henry was born in 1841 in Penrith. His father was Henry Herman Kater who had emigrated from England to Australia in 1839 bringing with him six thoroughbred horses which subsequently became sires of some of Australia‚Äôs famous racehorses. His mother was Eliza Charlotte Darvall, the daughter of Major Edward Darvall whom his father had married in Sydney shortly after his arrival. In 1870 in Wellington, NSW, Henry married Mary Eliza Forster who was the daughter of William Forster, a prominent politician and at one time the Premier of New South Wales. After his marriage Henry bought a pastoral properties with his brother Edward and they formed a partnership called Kater Bros. In 1889 he became a NSW Member of the Legislative Assembly and remained in this position until his death in 1924. Mount Broughton in 1929 Sir Norman Kater in his French Military uniform during World War I Between 1892 and 1924 Henry was a director of the Colonial Sugar Refining Co. and chairman in 1901-20. He was also vice-chairman of the Commercial Banking Co. of Sydney and a local director of the Liverpool and London and Globe Insurance Co. His most charitable work was for the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital as he gave the hospital its first X-ray machine and ¬£1000 to endow the H. E. Kater ward. When he died in 1924 his son Sir Norman Kater inherited Mount Broughton. Norman was born in 1874 in Ryde, NSW. He studied Medicine at the University of Sydney and became a Doctor. In 1901 he married Jean Gaerloch Mackenzie and the couple had six children four sons and two daughters. He went into partnership with his father running pastoral properties in NSW. On the outbreak of the War he joined the French Service de Sant√© Militaire. A photo of him in his French Military uniform is shown. He was awarded several medals for his War service. In 1926 Norman made substantial renovations and additions to the Mount Broughton house. A photo taken after these changes is shown. His modifications transformed the house but there is still significant evidence of the original 1878 building in the Music Room, the Games Room, the north east section of the front verandah, the detached servant‚Äôs quarters and Buttery near the new Garden Wing. Wedding of Jean Kater at Mount Broughton in 1929. In 1929 Norman‚Äôs daughter Jean married Ranald Munro whose Scottish family owned a sheep property in Dirranbandi in Queensland. The wedding which was held at Mount Broughtn and was described in detail in numerous newspapers throughout the country. One of these descriptions is as follows. :\\"The bride who was given away by her father wore an old world gown of ivory satin and tulle. The light fitting bodice was of satin and the skirt was composed of layers of tucked tulle over satin and was finished at the side with a crushed bow with long ends. The train was of dull gold tissue veiled in tulle and draped with point de gaze lace. The bride wore a veil of plain cut tulle drawn back from the face and caught with clusters of orange blossoms. She carried a shower of clematis, frangipani and knots of yellow roses.\\" :\\"After the ceremony the wedding party and guests motored to Mt. Broughton (now Peppers Manor House), Moss Vale, the charming country home of the bride's parents, which was beautifully decorated for the reception, and were received on arrival by the bride's parents, Dr. and Mrs. Kater, the latter wearing a handsome powder blue ensemble and a hat to tone. On the arrival of the bride and bridegroom, a shower of tawny-coloured pansies fell from a huge flora bell as they entered the reception room at Mt. Broughton. The invited guests were over 400, who included the Premier (Mr. T. Bavin) and Mrs. Bavin, and many prominent medical men and well known station people, both in N.S.W. and Queensland.\\" Norman died in 1965 and the house was sold Recent years After its sale in 1965 the house owned by a succession of people who were interested primarily in the land and the house fell into disrepair.

Born into slavery in Virginia and freed by the Emancipation Proclamation, he trained as a barber before moving to Massachusetts to pursue his education. He was the first African American to earn degrees from both Harvard University and its law school; the first African American to deliver Harvard's senior class oration; and the first black alderman in New England. As an attorney he handled many civil rights cases, in one instance closing down a segregated school. He was a founding member of the Niagara Movement and of the Boston branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.  Early life and education  Clement Garnett Morgan was born into slavery on January 9, 1859, in Stafford County, Virginia. When he and his parents were freed by the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, they moved to Washington, D.C., where Clement attended the M Street High School and trained as a barber. After finishing high school he moved to St. Louis, Missouri, where he taught for four years in an all-black school. Determined to acquire the best possible education, Morgan moved to Boston and attended the Boston Latin School for two years in preparation for college. While there he earned a Franklin Medal and won Lawrence Prizes for declamation and reading. In his senior year he held the post of adjutant of the school's battalion. He graduated with high honors in 1886. He was 27 when he enrolled at Harvard University a few months later. While at Harvard, Morgan covered his expenses by working in a barber shop on Shawmut Avenue and by winning several scholarships. During his senior year he won the Boylston Prize for oratory; his classmate, the noted intellectual and activist W. E. B. Du Bois, came in second. Morgan received his B.A. in 1890, and his LL.B. from Harvard University Law School in 1893. He was the first African American to earn both of those degrees at Harvard. The following year, Du Bois became the first African American to earn both a B.A. and a Ph.D. from Harvard. = Harvard \\"class day\\" oration = Each year, Harvard seniors elected a classmate to deliver a speech on \\"class day\\", the week before graduation, while the faculty selected six students to speak at the graduation ceremony. In October 1889, the senior class elected Morgan to give the class day oration. Morgan's selection was unprecedented: not only was he Harvard's first African-American class day speaker, he was also the first working-class student to receive an honor normally reserved for those from elite Boston Brahmin families. The election made national headlines; most were congratulatory, although several Southern newspapers published mocking editorials. Harvard officials made a point of avoiding publicity, not wishing to suggest that his selection was based on anything other than merit, and Morgan himself refused to speak to the press. An 1889 Boston Globe article describes Morgan as \\"a dignified young man, with the manners of a Chesterfield. He is 5 feet 6 inches in height, broad shouldered and quite dark in color, with a wide forehead and brilliant eyes.\\" Colonel Thomas Wentworth Higginson, who knew Morgan, spoke highly of him and added, \\"I do not recall a single case in which a young man has shown greater endurance in struggling against all kinds of opposition.\\" A rigorous procedure was used to select the six commencement speakers. To qualify for the competition, students first had to achieve a high grade point average. They then wrote essays and gave oral presentations which were graded by a seven-member faculty committee. Of the 44 presentations, Du Bois's received by far the highest score. Morgan's also ranked among the top six. Some committee members, however, objected to having two African-American students speak at graduation. After a heated debate, the committee voted to replace Morgan with a white student. One of the members, James B. Thayer, resigned from the committee in protest, writing later, \\"We had a wonderful opportunity...and it was a bitter thing to see it lost by the vote of one who thought the man [Morgan] deserved the place, but excluded him because of his color, or...on account of the other man's color.\\"  Career  Soon after graduating from law school, Morgan was admitted to the Suffolk bar. He opened a law practice at 39 Court Street in Boston. = Civil rights work = Niagara movement meeting in Fort Erie, Canada, 1905. Morgan is second from the left in the front row. While still a student, Morgan showed an interest in civil rights activism. On July 8, 1890, he made a stirring speech on \\"Race Unity\\" at the Charles Street A. M. E. Church in Boston, before a large gathering of the Colored National League. The other speakers were Mark R. DeMortie, Carrie Washington, and the abolitionist John J. Smith. In Morgan's speech, he stressed the importance of education, asserting that African Americans \\"should be given every chance of cultivating heart and head\\" and urging listeners to save their money and send their sons to college. He also declared his pride in his ancestry in no uncertain terms: > I am glad to be a negro and I mean it from the bottom of my heart. I mean to > be a negro. On the bottom of my heart is written negro...If any of you are > ashamed of your blood it is cowardice. As an attorney, Morgan handled many civil rights cases. In 1902, with his good friend Butler R. Wilson, Morgan tried to fight the extradition of a black factory worker named Monroe Rogers to North Carolina, arguing that he was likely to be lynched there. Reportedly, Rogers had turned off the main water valve of a house at the request of his girlfriend, who worked there as a domestic; for this, he was accused of attempting to burn down the house, and charged with the capital crime of arson. The case inspired angry protests in Boston, where it was widely believed that a black defendant could not get a fair trial in the South. The following year, Morgan successfully represented black parents in Sheffield, Massachusetts, who refused to send their children to the Plain School, a segregated school for the town's 33 black children. The school was subsequently shut down. Morgan was one of the original 29 members of the Niagara Movement, a civil rights organization founded by Du Bois in 1905. Du Bois chose him to represent the Massachusetts chapter. Along with Butler R. Wilson, William Monroe Trotter and others, Morgan was critical of Booker T. Washington's accommodationist approach. Morgan was later active in the Boston branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), which was presided over by Wilson. Morgan and Wilson worked together again in 1915 when, with Trotter and other activists, they led a spirited but unsuccessful effort to ban The Birth of a Nation from Boston theaters. The film, which vilified African Americans and glorified the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), was the focus of many protests in Boston. At one rally, Morgan demanded the recall of Mayor James Michael Curley, who refused to ban the film. In the 1920s, New England experienced an increase in anti-Catholic KKK activity; by allying with the Catholic Church, Trotter was able to get the film banned in 1921. = City of Cambridge = Clement G. Morgan Park, Cambridge, Massachusetts Morgan was active in Republican Party politics. In December 1894 he was elected to the Cambridge Common Council from the predominantly white Ward 2, and served two one-year terms. In 1896, he became the first African American to be elected to the Cambridge Board of Aldermen, and the first black alderman in New England. Following his inauguration, city business and political leaders held a banquet in his honor at the Odd Fellows Hall in Cambridgeport. He served on the board in 1897 and 1898. He later ran unsuccessfully for the state legislature.  Personal life  Morgan lived on Columbia Street in Cambridge until 1897. That year he married Gertrude Wright in Springfield, Illinois, and moved to 265 Prospect Street in the neighborhood of Inman Square. No children are mentioned in his obituary. The Morgans belonged to several of the city's exclusive social clubs, including the Omar Khayyam Circle, a black literary and intellectual group which met at the Cambridge home of Maria Baldwin.  Death and legacy  Morgan died on June 1, 1929, at the Corey Hill Hospital in Brookline, Massachusetts. Clement G. Morgan Park in the Port/Area 4 neighborhood of Cambridge was dedicated to him on February 11, 1991. He is memorialized at the site with a plaque and a mural.

Greenough was a pioneer in studies of neural development and brain plasticity. He studied learning and memory and the brain's responses to environmental enrichment, exercise, injury, and aging. He demonstrated that the brain continues to form new synaptic connections between nerve cells throughout life in response to environmental enrichment and learning. This mechanism is fundamental to learning and memory storage in the brain. Greenough is regarded as the predominant researcher in this area and has been described as \\"one of the towering figures in neuroscience\\". Early life and education William Greenough was born in Seattle, Washington, on October 10, 1944. He later lived in Gearhart, Oregon and Seaside, Oregon. In 1964, at age 19, he completed an undergraduate degree in psychology at the University of Oregon. He earned his master's degree from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1966 and his Ph.D. in psychology at the University of California, Los Angeles in 1969. His thesis title was Pharmacological and Biochemical Studies on Learning Performance as a Function of Post-Weaning Environment in Rats. Career Greenough then joined the faculty at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign as an assistant professor, becoming a full professor in 1978. He chaired the psychology committee that helped to form the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at Illinois and became one of the Beckman Institute's first two half-time associate directors in the fall of 1987. He served as director of the Beckman Institute's Neuroscience Program from 1997‚Äì2000. In 1998, Greenough was appointed to the Swanlund Endowed Chair in psychology. During his career, Greenough held a broad range of faculty appointments including psychology, psychiatry, bioengineering, cell and structural biology, and molecular and integrative physiology. He became interim director of the Center for Advanced Study in 2000, and was appointed its director in 2001. He retired in 2009, becoming professor emeritus. Greenough was also active nationally, and lobbied the United States Congress to support academic research. In 2007, he co-edited Defining values for research and technology : the university's changing role, based on a lecture series that began at Illinois in 2000. The book examines the history of research funding at American universities and the ways in which federal policy had changed. A shift from public to private sources of funding caused new challenges for universities, financially, strategically, and ethically. Research Prior to Greenough's work, the prevalent belief was that the structure of the brain was determined very early in life and did not change substantially other than to degenerate as a result of damage due to injury, illness, or aging. It was believed that synapses were formed early in brain development, and that once the initial structure of the brain was formed, no further synapse formation occurred. The brain was believed to be an anatomically static structure and memories were believed to result from synaptic activity within a fixed nervous system. According to this view, what you were born with determined your potential for the rest of your life. This view of brain structure, neural activity, and learning was completely overturned by Greenough's research. Greenough initially worked with mice and rat models, later studying primates and humans. His studies demonstrated that fundamental physical changes occurred in neurons in the brain in response to stimulating environments. At the most basic cellular level, the brains of rats that lived in stimulating environments developed more synapses than those that did not. He went on to demonstrate that new synapses were formed as a result of activities that involved learning, not just increased activity. Moreover, changes occurred in areas of the brain that were associated with the performance of specific learned tasks. Observed changes in learning, memory, and synapse formation persisted after training. Learning and memory formation were therefore fundamentally related to ongoing synapse formation. The result of Greenough's work has been a new model of brain 'plasticity' in which long- term memories are formed at a structural level in the brain as part of lifelong processes of learning. Greenough went on to study the mechanisms by which such changes occur. He has carried out pioneering studies of synaptic mechanisms in the developing brain and endocrine modulation during brain development. He has integrated theories of developmental and adult learning into a unified model. According to this model, synapses are produced early in development that are experience-expectant. They are believed to incorporate environmental aspects that have been encountered reliably as the species has evolved. Such synapses have developed to collect types of information relevant to the ordinary experience of creatures of a species. In contrast, synapses developing later in life are described as experience-dependent, and are believed to form in response to experiences that result in memories. In addition to neurons, Greenough has reported sensitivity to experience in astrocytes and vasculature, studying processes within the brain including angiogenesis, myelination, the hypertrophy of astrocytic glial cells and the astrocyte ensheathment of neurons. Another researcher describes these processes as \\"cellular transactions that drive coordinated structural changes in neurons, glia, and blood vessels\\", essential to understanding the working of long-term memory. By studying Fragile X syndrome, which is the most common form of mental retardation to be genetically inherited, as well as other genetic conditions, Greenough has learned about how the brain can malfunction as well as function. Studies of mice with Fragile X syndrome link the condition to the absence of the protein FMRP. Greenough's lab identifies FMRP as a regulator protein affecting between 80 and 200 other proteins in the brain. In summary, Greenough's central contribution was the demonstration that brain development is influenced throughout life by factors such as the environment, exercise and lifelong learning. Greenough used and sometimes introduced a variety of techniques to study neuroanatomy and neural plasticity, including light microscopy, electron microscopy, electrophysiological studies and molecular approaches. Greenough's work is influential in developmental psychology, studies of brain aging and brain damage, learning and memory, neurology, psychiatry, and audiology.

As the Head of Epidemiology Research, she studies the causes and effects of diseases and illnesses within a specific country, in her case Saudi Arabia. She studies the prevalence of conditions such as obesity and mental illness in Saudi society, and is active in advocating for social and political changes to promote better health. Education Altwaijri studied Community Health at King Saud University in Riyadh, receiving her B.Sc. in 1992. After marrying, she and her husband moved to the United States to attend graduate school. Altwaijri studied with Johanna Dwyer, director of the Frances Stern Nutrition Center at Tufts University's Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy. She received her M.Sc. from Tufts University in 1996 and her Ph.D in 2002. Her parents strongly encouraged her to have a professional career that would enable her to be financially independent. Career After returning to Saudi Arabia from Boston in 2002, Altwaijri joined King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences. Next she joined King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre in Riyadh where she leads the epidemiology research center. She is considered one of the top senior scientists in the country. Altwaijri is involved in designing and carrying out epidemiological studies of the Saudi population, with particular attention to women, children and adolescents. One area of concern is the lack of pubertal growth standards for Saudi children. The only standards available to Saudi pediatricians have been based on pubertal characteristics of children in the United States. Altwaijri is developing epidemiological studies of Saudi children that will be sensitive to factors in Saudi life such as socioeconomic standards, diet, and geography. She also researches risk factors such as obesity, smoking, hypertension, high blood cholesterol and lack of exercise, which affect chronic diseases. She emphasizes the importance of social determinants of health and strongly advocates for social and political changes that would promote more healthy lifestyles. She is particularly concerned about women, who are at a higher risk of developing obesity than Saudi men, in part because socio-cultural factors restrict opportunities for women to exercise and discourage women's participation in sports. Altwaijri advocates for the inclusion of a physical curriculum for girls as well as boys in schools; creation of safe neighborhood play spaces for both male and female children; safe areas where adult men and women can be physically active; and affordable health clubs for both women and men. She also supports regulation of food prices to promote the choice of healthy over unhealthy foods. To keep her children active, she enrolled them in competitive team swimming, where they became eligible to attend the AAU Junior Olympic Games. Altwaijri is a Principal Investigator for the Saudi National Mental Health Survey, a broad- based investigation assessing the impact of mental illness in Saudi communities. No research into this area had been done previously in Saudi Arabia, even though the World Health Organization (WHO) reports that five of the ten most burdensome diseases in the world involve mental health. In addition to Saudi government and educational institutions, this research involves international collaboration with Harvard University, the University of Michigan, and the World Health Organization. The study, which was initiated in 2009, had the goal of visiting the homes of 5,000 men and women to interview people from across the country. 86% of interviewees were willing to participate. = Obesity in Saudi Arabia = Obesity, and specifically childhood obesity, is on the rise around the world. This trend is mostly be seen in developed countries, but it is also seen in developing countries, including the Middle East, Central and Eastern Europe. Saudi Arabia has seen an increase in childhood obesity and one in every six children in Saudi Arabia is obese. These trends correlate to lack of exercise, problems with focusing at school, and a decrease in playing with other children. Among the adult population, there is a prevalence of 42.4% obesity in males and 31.8% obesity in females. This rise in obesity puts a major strain on the healthcare system in Saudi Arabia as it is a risk factor for more serious diseases, such as cardiovascular disease. It can be attributed to the recent strengthening of the economy in Saudi Arabia. The accelerating economy was accompanied by a more \\"westernized\\" diet with more nutritional concerns.  Women in science  Altwaijri chairs the Saudi Women in Science Committee, a national network of female scientists from Saudi Arabia. She encourages Saudi women to enter scientific and technological fields, arguing that women scientists can use electronic forms of communication to collaborate and do significant work without \\"cross[ing] the boundaries of our societal norms and customs.\\" She indicates that restrictions such as the ban on women drivers make it difficult for women to go to work or to visit a fitness center. Altwaijri is one of thirty-five women featured in the book Arab Women Rising, which includes women from Tunisia to Saudi Arabia. She was included in the BBC's 2014 list featuring 100 Women internationally.

They are stories about a large animal that is pursued by hunters, is wounded, and is transformed into a constellation. Variants of the Cosmic Hunt are common in cultures of Northern Eurasia and the Americas, and include the story of Callisto in classical sources. The prey animal is either a bear or an ungulate, and the constellation it is transformed into is typically the four stars of the bowl in the Big Dipper asterism of Ursa Major. In some variants blood or grease may fall from the wounded animal, in an Iroquois version the blood causes leaves to change color in autumn. Sometimes the hunters are also placed in the firmament, represented by the stars of the Big Dipper's handle. The original prototype of the myth must have been invented at least 15,000 years ago for it to have diffused across the Bering land bridge.

Origins According to traditional Arab genealogy, the Banu al-Qayn was founded by a certain al-Nu'man ibn Jasr, who was known as al- Qayn (the iron smith).Watt, p. 820. However, according to all historical indications, the tribe was strictly Bedouin and its tribesmen did not involve themselves in metalwork. The Banu al-Qayn formed part of the Quda'a, a large tribal confederation. History According to historian Irfan Shahid, \\"it is almost certain\\" that the Banu al-Qayn, along with the Judham and Amila tribes, \\"functioned as military units in the Roman period, forming part of the Nabatean confederacy\\".Shahid, p. 390. Moreover, Shahid argues the Banu al-Qayn dated back to the biblical era and \\"represent[ed] the strand of ethnographic continuity in the region, running from biblical to Byzantine to Muslim Arab times\\".Shahid, pp. 390‚Äì391. In the 4th century CE, the tribe's dwelling places were in Transjordan and they served as foederati (federates) of the Byzantine Empire.Shahid, p. 544. They were among the Arab foederati, including the Banu Kalb, Judham, Bali, and Lakhm, that fought the Muslim Arabs at the Battle of Mu'tah in 629.Shahid, p. 395, n. 173. However, at least part of the Banu al- Qayn was on friendly terms with the Muslims for the latter had hoped for help from the Banu al-Qayn during the Battle of Chains that same year. They again appear fighting for the Byzantines against the Muslims at the battles of Yarmouk and Fahl. Most of the tribe converted to Islam following the Muslim conquest of Syria, which concluded in 638. The Banu al-Qayn, along with other Quda'a tribes, such as the Banu Kalb, backed Marwan I in the latter's bid to become caliph during the Second Muslim Civil War. During a territorial dispute between the Banu al-Qayn and Banu Kalb over Wadi Sirhan, Marwan's son and successor, Abd al-Malik, ruled in favor of the Kalb. About six hundred al- Qayni tribesmen took part in the Umayyad campaign against the Kharijite rebel Bahlul in 737. According to historian W. Montgomery Watt, \\"the last that is heard\\" of the Banu al-Qayn was in 792, during the Abbasid era, when they were involved in intertribal fighting in Damascus.

Employing around 10,000 workers, the factory has a floor area of on a total area of . Peak production capacity is 10,000 tractors per year. The factory's current products include the Ch'≈èllima 28 , Ch'≈èllima 32 , Ch'≈èllima 40 , P'ungny≈èn 75 , Sony≈èn and Ch'≈èllima 2000 tractors, and the P'ungny≈èn bulldozer. As of 2017, the factory was producing the new 80-hp Ch'≈èllima 804 tractor model. Claims have been made this factory also produces TEL mobile missile platforms. The facility is served by the Korean State Railway via Kangs≈è Station on the P'y≈èngnam Line. History The plant was opened in 1954, rebuilt from the ruins of a chemical fertiliser plant destroyed during the Korean War, producing various agricultural implements. The first tractor, the 'Ch'≈èllima 28, entered production in 1958. The prototype of this tractor, which was reverse engineered from a Soviet design, was built up in forty days, but only ran in reverse gear. Production capacity was expanded significantly in the following years; between 1970 and 1978, output increased 8.7 times, and by 1979, only 30% of production was of the 28-horsepower model, with the other 70% being accounted for by the 75-hp P'ungny≈èn model. Automation is also extensive; for example, the process of making the gearbox and the engine blocks are each overseen by a single person.

The album displays the band's early pop-punk sound, and is the only album to feature founding members Patrick Flores and Amy Woods in its entirety. The hidden track, \\"Wait\\", has been used in the TV series Grey's Anatomy and has been used in the first volume of the series soundtrack. Background and recording The band formed in 2002, originally under the name Vermicious K, then later on as All Your Bass Are Belong To Us, then finally as Get Set Go. After recording a 3-track demo with Ben Vaughn, the group gained the attention of the independent family-operated label TSR Records and were signed. The group then proceeded to work on their debut full-length in the spring of 2003, again hiring Vaughn to help with production. The group first recorded the drum and bass tracks at Stanley Recordings before going to Mad Dog Studios to record the vocals and guitars. The entire album was mixed at MT Studios, Burbank and finally mastered at Bernie Grundman Studios. The entire album took around 3 months to complete. The artwork for the album was done by artist Dave Johnson, who later did the cover art for the band's 2011 album Fury of Your Lonely Heart. Critical reception While not reviewed by many since its release, the attention the album did receive was positive. Brad Filicky of CMJ Magazine gave the album a positive review, stating \\"So You've Ruined Your Life proves that this is a group ready for its close-up and is bound to get the respect that it deserves\\". Commercial performance Despite the fact that the band did a national tour to promote the album, So You've Ruined Your Life failed to reach any sort of commercial success. By 2004, both Flores and Woods left the group to pursue other careers. Guitarist and vocalist Michael Torres would later fall into a state of depression and drug addiction, which eventually resulted in him getting sober and continuing Get Set Go with a revolving door of new members.

The album marks a shift in sound for the band, going for more of an indie rock approach when compared to the slick pop-punk sound of its predecessor, So You've Ruined Your Life. All of the album's tracks were written during a time in which the band's main songwriter, Michael Torres, was addicted to drugs. Lyrical themes include misanthropy, drugs, alcohol, terrorism, the end of the world, murder, and relationship problems. It is the first album to feature long-time band members Eric Summer and Dave Palamero. Background and recording Get Set Go formed in 2002 in Highland Park, Los Angeles with a line up consisting of guitarist, vocalist, and main songwriter Michael Torres (known by his nickname Mike TV), bassist Patrick Flores (known by his nickname Dr. Modo) and drummer Amy Wood. The trio were signed to the independent family-operated TSR Records in 2003 and released their debut album So You've Ruined Your Life in September that same year. The album met very little fanfare and next to no radio airplay, and by 2004, both Flores and Wood left the band to pursue other careers (both did, however, help with the production of Ordinary World later on). Torres fell into a state of depression afterwards and later became a drug addict. During his addiction, Torres wrote 64 songs on his acoustic guitar, most of which later found their way on Ordinary World. By 2005, Torres was able to become sober and, with the help of new members of the band, began working on the second Get Set Go album. While Ordinary World was only ever released on compact disc formats, the design of the album is a homage to double disc LP records, with the track listing being divided into four \\"parts\\" (four sides of a record). Ordinary World was recorded throughout June 2005, fourteen tracks at Stanley Recordings and another seven tracks at Nate Greeley's home studio. By this point in time, the \\"official\\" Get Set Go line up consisted of Torres, violist Eric Summer, and drummer Dave Palamaro. Producer John Would performed bass guitar on most of the album, although for some were performed by Patrick Flores. The same case was made for the drums, for some recordings were performed by Amy Wood. Nate Greeley also performed guitar on this album. Mixing duties were shared by Torres, Would, and Greeley.

It opened in the early 1980s, and closed in 2009 due to financial hardship.  History  In the 1850s, Benjamin Chew Howard, a four term Congressman and son of John Eager Howard, and his wife Janet Gilmore, built and resided in the mansion now addressed at 924 N. Charles Street, which was a parcel of his father‚Äôs Belvedere Estate. Later, Charles Morton Stewart, a Brazilian coffee importer and his wife, Josephine Lurman, purchased the building as their winter residence, raising 14 children between the mansion and their summer home in Greenspring Valley, Maryland. In the late 1890s, George Wroth Knapp, Jr.a local merchant, purchased and used the mansion as his second home during his Baltimore work weeks. He and his wife, Sara Gilfry invested $100,000 on decorative items such as crystal (Waterford), marble (Rinehart), teak (de Forest) and stained glass (Tiffany). In the 1930s, the space was converted into a retail establishment. Potthast Brothers Furniture purchased the building for retail purposes. They reconfigured the first floor that fronts N. Charles Street with stairs leading from the front salon down to a lower level to serve as a furniture showcase to attract passersby. In the late 1970s, William (Billy) Paley, Jr., the son of William S. Paley who grew CBS from a small radio network into one of the foremost radio and television network operations in the nation, led a group of investors to purchase and re- purpose the mansion into a new restaurant. The building formerly occupied by The Brass Elephant was sold at a public auction on August 3, 2010.

Diametrically opposed accounts of his character are given by the partisans of Gembloux and Lobbes. The Abbey of Gembloux was founded on lands donated by Guibert and confirmed by King Otto I in 946. Erluin was its first abbot. He continued as its abbot even during his abbacy at Lobbes. Since 889, the royal Abbey of Lobbes had been administered on behalf of the crown by the bishops of Li√®ge, who held the office of abbot, although the monks continued to elect their own provost (praepositus) per the Rule of Saint Benedict. In 956, the provost was Blitard, while the lay abbacy was in the hands of Reginar III of Hainaut, who had received his appointment from his nephew, Bishop Balderic. Through a series of manoeuvres, Reginar and Erluin got Blitard ejected from the monastery and Erluin appointed in his place, contrary to the Rule of Saint Benedict. In 957, Erluin was promoted to full abbot and the rule of the bishops of Li√®ge came to an end. Folcuin, in his Deeds of the Abbots of Lobbes, says that Erluin was hated by the monks because he was considered a close friend of Count Reginar. On Christmas Day, 956, he held a banquet for the count, the countess, the bishop and their friends, to which he did not invite the monks. Folcuin accuses the party of desecrating the church. Erluin apparently compounded the offence by trying to sell the harvest of the village of Biesmer√©e to pay for the festivities. The controversy over Biesmer√©e was the incitement for the subsequent physical assault on Erluin by some of the monks. On the night of 20 October 957, three young monks of Lobbes assaulted Erluin, ripping him from his bed and taking him outside the cloister, where they gouged out his eyes and cut out part of his tongue. Although it was not unknown for monks to resort to violence to rid themselves of a hated abbot, contemporaries regarded the attack on Erluin as excessively brutal. The perpetrators probably intended to physically remove Erluin from participation in the lectio divina, which required both eyes and tongue. According to Folcuin, Erluin hoped to be martyred, but when the monks refused to oblige, he took a boat up the river to Gembloux during the night. With his tongue only partially removed, Erluin retained some ability to speak. Sigebert, the historian of Gembloux, in his Deeds of the Abbots of Gembloux, includes an account of Erluin's abbacy at Lobbes with the express purpose of \\"correcting\\" the account of Folcuin. According to Sigebert, Erluin took the abbacy of Lobbes with the intent of reforming the community and was aware of the risks of going there. He describes the three men who attacked Erluin as \\"vain nobility in the firmness of youth\\". Many of the monks at Lobbes came from the high nobility, since the abbey was a prestigious royal foundation. In 958, Archbishop Bruno of Cologne, who was also Duke of Lotharingia, forced Count Reginar into exile. A new abbot, Aletran, also from Gembloux, was appointed to Lobbes and began to reform the community. Erluin remained as abbot of Gembloux until his death in 987, when he was succeeded by his brother Heriward.

In 2016, Jones's films were selected for the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Films Jones's films consist of 29 silent black-and-white films documenting African-American communities in Oklahoma from 1924 to 1928. They contain 355 minutes of footage shot with then-new 16 mm cameras. The films document a rich tapestry of everyday life: funerals, sporting events, schools, parades, businesses, Masonic meetings, river baptisms, families at home, African- American oil barons and their wells, black colleges, Juneteenth celebrations and a transcontinental footrace. Jones's films have been preserved by the Smithsonian Institution, the Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library of the Yale University Library, and the National Museum of African American History and Culture. They are considered to be \\"the most extensive film records we have of Southern and urban black life and culture at the time of rapid social and cultural change for African-Americans during the 1920s, the very beginning of the Great Migration, which transformed not only black people as a whole, but America itself.\\" Personal life In addition to his work with film, Jones was a businessman and a Baptist minister, who either established or was the pastor of some 15 churches in his lifetime. He was the son of ex-slaves, was born in Tennessee and grew up in the South, before moving to Oklahoma, where he lived for most of his life. Jones spent the next several decades building black institutions, establishing churches, newspapers, and businesses, and support the activities of schools and hospitals. Jones also remained active in church politics, holding leadership roles in the National Baptist Convention of America, one of the largest African American denominations in the United States, for many years. Jones was a fierce defender of black institutions, one of many African American leaders in Oklahoma who supported what came to be called ‚ÄúAll-Black towns,‚Äù municipalities occupied and governed by black settlers. One of these towns was targeted in 1921 by white mobs for one of the worse racist attacks in American history. More than 800 people were admitted to hospitals and as many as 6,000 black residents were interned in large facilities, many of them for several days. The Oklahoma Bureau of Vital Statistics officially recorded 36 dead.

Anatomy Mysids from the genus Idiomysis are just few millimeters length; their cephalothorax is gibbous and robust whereas the abdomen is characteristically curled up behind. When compared with other mysids, Idiomysis has short antennae, relatively big eyes and small, usually unarmed telson, however a single species, I. diadema, possesses a pair of short terminal spines. Systematics A swarm of Idiomysis hovering next to the coral in Mozambique Channel. There are six species described so far in the genus: * Idiomysis diadema Wittmann, 2016 * Idiomysis inermis W. Tattersall, 1922 * Idiomysis japonica Murano, 1978 * Idiomysis mozambica Deprez, Wooldridge & Mees, 2001 * Idiomysis robusta Connell, 2008 * Idiomysis tsurnamali Bacescu, 1973. Ecology Idiomysis live in the small groups (called swarms) of 5 to more than 40 individuals, which hover over sea bottom during a day and probably feed on the seafloor on the nighttime. All known species are found in the shallow coastal waters, however they inhabit different niches and can be found on coral reefs, seaweeds, rocks or sandy bottoms. Two species ‚Äì I. inermis and I. tsurnamali ‚Äì are known for commensal relationship with the sea anemones, whereas I. diadema is associated with the sea urchin Diadema. There are also reports of Idiomysis hovering above upside-down jellyfish, Cassiopea. Possibly mysids gain protection and/or food supply from this relationship, however the exact nature of the relation has not been studied.

Her husband's business necessitated his removing to Vienna; here Meyer met Leopold Kompert and Ludwig August von Frankl, and here she produced her sketch of Vienna life entitled Wider die Katur. Another work, entitled Rachel (Vienna, 1859), was a novel describing the life of the actress Rachel F√©lix. In Banden Frei (Berlin, 1869), her last novel, was a character study of her friend Lina Davidson. Meyer spent her last years in Berlin, with her daughters.

Map of Chile including offshore islands, maritime exclusive economic zone and its Antarctic claim. Chilean expansionism refers to the foreign policy of Chile to expand its territorial control over key strategic locations and economic resources as a means to ensure its national security and assert its power in South America. Chile's significant territorial acquisitions, which occurred mostly throughout the 19th century, paved the way for its emergence as one of the three most powerful and wealthiest states in South America during the 20th century. It also formed Chile's geopolitical and national identity as a tricontinental state and one of the countries with the longest coastlines in the world. After achieving its independence from Spain in 1818, Chile held control of territory spanning roughly the same boundaries of the colonial general captaincy that was under the control of the Spanish Empire's Viceroyalty of Peru. Under the uti possidetis iuris principle that delimited the international boundaries of the newly independent South American states, Chile bordered at its north with Bolivia in the Atacama Desert and at its east with Argentina. To the south, Chile claimed all lands west of the Andes and the entirety of Patagonia (principally for the Strait of Magellan), but in practice controlled only the area down to the B√≠o B√≠o River plus the area between Valdivia and Chilo√©‚Äîthe rest of the territory being either controlled by the independent Mapuche of Araucan√≠a or sparsely populated by other indigenous tribes. The uti possidetis system proved ephemeral, nonetheless; the lack of formal border treaties caused territorial disputes throughout the continent. This uncertainty presented both challenges and opportunities for Chile, with regional instability creating a precarious state of diplomatic affairs but also allowing the growth of Chilean power ambitions. The Chilean national elite sought to ensure that the country's territorial limits and the regional balance of power would favor their economic and political aspirations. Towards this end, the country increased its military power, especially its naval presence, to pursue a policy of intimidation and force. To its north, Chile imposed its dominance by eliminating the threat posed by the union of Bolivia with Peru during the War of the Confederation (1836-1839), followed by the conquest of these countries' mineral-rich territories in the Atacama during the War of the Pacific (1879-1884)‚Äîin the process leaving Bolivia landlocked and pillaging the Peruvian capital. To its south and east, Chile used military force and colonization to occupy Araucan√≠a (1861-1883) and successfully dispute Argentine claims over westernmost Patagonia and the Strait of Magellan‚Äîthe outbreak of war only narrowly avoided in multiple occasions. Chile's expansionist drive practically culminated with Easter Island's annexation in 1888, but vestiges of it continued well into the 20th century‚Äîe.g., the country's claim over Antarctic territory in 1940. Although Chile did not fulfill all of its territorial ambitions, its relative success attracted the attention of the Western Hemisphere's other major expansionist polity, the United States, and cemented Chile's status as a regional power in Latin America. Chile's territorial expansion also left a legacy of distrust with its neighbors, all of which continue having boundary disputes with Chile. The country's mistreatment of the non-Chilean inhabitants of its conquered territories, particularly the state-sponsored forced cultural assimilation process of \\"Chilenization\\", have further led to internal tensions and calls for greater autonomy, if not independence, from the Mapuche and the Rapa Nui.  Origins  Chilean statesman Diego Portales was the lead proponent of his country's aggressive foreign policy The newly independent Republic of Chile's territorial possessions, inherited from the colonial general captaincy (capitan√≠a general) that was under the control of the Spanish Empire's Viceroyalty of Peru, had left the state surrounded by undefined boundaries. Its northernmost settlement was Copiap√≥ in the southern Atacama Desert, bordering Bolivia; however, its exact boundary was disputed until 1866, when both countries delimited their boundaries at the 24¬∞ South parallel from the Pacific Ocean. Its southernmost settlement was Concepci√≥n, a few kilometers north of the frontier fortifications between Chile and the Araucan√≠a, the territory that the Mapuche indigenous peoples had successfully retained after defeating Spain in the Arauco War. Portales convinced the Chilean elite to fight for the dissolution of the union between Bolivia and Peru in 1836.  History  = Conquest of the Atacama = capture of Peru's warship Hu√°scar, in 1879, further assured its naval supremacy and victory in the war. To its north, Chile imposed its dominance by eliminating the threat posed by the union of Bolivia with Peru during the War of the Confederation (1836-1839), followed by the conquest of these countries' mineral-rich territories in the Atacama during the War of the Pacific (1879-1884)‚Äîin the process leaving Bolivia landlocked and sacking the Peruvian capital. Chile slowly started to expand its influence and to establish its borders. By the Tantauco Treaty, the archipelago of Chilo√© was incorporated in 1826. The economy began to boom due to the discovery of silver ore in Cha√±arcillo, and the growing trade of the port of Valpara√≠so, which led to conflict over maritime supremacy in the Pacific with Peru. The Boundary treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina confirmed Chilean sovereignty over the Strait of Magellan. As a result of the War of the Pacific with Peru and Bolivia (1879‚Äì83), Chile expanded its territory northward by almost one-third, eliminating Bolivia's access to the Pacific, and acquired valuable nitrate deposits, the exploitation of which led to an era of national affluence. Chile had joined the stand as one of the high-income countries in South America by 1870. = Occupation of Araucan√≠a = cavalry raids for defence To its south and east, Chile used military force and colonization to occupy Araucan√≠a (1861-1883) and successfully dispute Argentine claims over westernmost Patagonia and the Strait of Magellan‚Äîthe outbreak of war only narrowly avoided in multiple occasions. = Colonization of Patagonia = At the same time, attempts were made to strengthen sovereignty in southern Chile intensifying penetration into Araucan√≠a and colonizing Llanquihue with German immigrants in 1848. Through the founding of Fort Bulnes by the Schooner Ancud under the command of John Williams Wilson, the Magallanes region joined the country in 1843, while the Antofagasta area, at the time part of, Bolivia, began to fill with people. = Annexation of Easter Island = Chilean statesman Vicu√±a Mackenna was a major advocate of Chilean expansionism into Polynesia Chile's interest in expanding into the islands of the Pacific Ocean dates to the presidency of Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Prieto (1831-1841) and the ideology of Diego Portales, who considered that Chile's expansion into Polynesia was a natural consequence of its maritime destiny. The first stage of the country's expansionism into the Pacific began a decade later, in 1851, when‚Äîin response to an American incursion into the Juan Fern√°ndez Islands‚ÄîChile's government formally organized the islands into a subdelegation of Valpara√≠so. That same year, Chile's merchant fleet briefly succeeded in creating an agricultural goods exchange market that connected the Californian port of San Francisco with Australia, renewing Chile's economic interest in the Pacific. By 1861, Chile had established a lucrative enterprise across the Pacific, its national currency abundantly circulating throughout Polynesia and its merchants trading in the markets of Tahiti, New Zealand, Tasmania, and Shanghai; moreover, negotiations were also made with the Spanish Philippines, and altercations reportedly occurred between Chilean and American whalers in the Sea of Japan.See: This period ended as a result of the Chilean merchant fleet's destruction by Spanish forces in 1866, during the Chincha Islands War. Chile's Polynesian aspirations would again be awakened in the aftermath of the country's decisive victory against Peru in the War of the Pacific, which left the Chilean fleet as the dominant maritime force in the Pacific coast of the Americas. Valpara√≠so had also become the most important port in the Pacific coast of South America, providing Chilean merchants with the capacity to find markets in the Pacific for its new mineral wealth acquired from the Atacama. During this period, the Chilean intellectual and politician Benjam√≠n Vicu√±a Mackenna (who served as senator in the National Congress from 1876 to 1885) was an influential voice in favor of Chilean expansionism into the Pacific‚Äîhe considered that Spain's discoveries in the Pacific had been stolen by the British, and envisioned that Chile's duty was to create an empire in the Pacific that would reach Asia. In the context of this imperialist fervor is that, in 1886, Captain Policarpo Toro of the Chilean Navy proposed to his superiors the annexation of Easter Island; a proposal that attained support from President Jos√© Manuel Balmaceda because of the island's apparent strategic location and economic value. After Toro transferred the rights to the island's sheep ranching operations from Tahiti-based businesses to the Chilean-based Williamson-Balfour Company in 1887, Easter Island's annexation process was culminated with the signing of the \\"Agreement of Wills\\" between Rapa Nui chieftains and Toro, in name of the Chilean government, in 1888.See:  =Antarctic claim=  Consequences  In 1978, amid direct negotiations attempting to settle the Beagle conflict, Chilean Dictator Augusto Pinochet assured that Chile had no expansionist intentions, but that his government would \\"defend the patrimony that belongs to it by right.\\" In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Chile temporarily resolved its border disputes with Argentina with the Puna de Atacama Lawsuit of 1899 and the Cordillera of the Andes Boundary Case, 1902. Chile's rise as a major geopolitical power in the South Pacific also had the consequence of placing it in direct confrontation with the United States.See:  Criticism  General Pinochet posing with a native Rapa Nui woman According to Chilean diplomat Juan Salazar Sparks, the political theories of Andr√©s Bello and Diego Portales were neither expansionist nor interventionist; rather, he argues, they believed that Chile's status as a maritime nation and its role as a promoter of Pan-Americanism rested on its moral leadership, cultural influence, and success in maintaining the regional balance of power. Moreover, he considers that Chile was forced into wars with Peru and Bolivia in order to protect the regional balance of power, and that the country's participation in the Chincha Islands War is evidence of its commitment to Pan-Americanism. Chilean researcher Felipe Sanfuentes also argues that Chile was not an expansionist country and considers that this perspective is promoted by Argentine irrendentism over Tierra del Fuego and Patagonia.

She gave birth out of wedlock to a child of mixed race, in defiance of legal restrictions on the sexual activity of indentured servants and strong social prejudice against interracial relationships.  Early life in indentured servitude  Sally Brant started working for the Drinker family when she was ten years old, after the death of her mother and her mother's remarriage. She was one of several servants in the Drinker household, including indentured servants, free servants who lived in the house, and free day workers.Merrill Smith, Women's Roles in 18th-century America\\", p. 19 She fulfilled maid's duties while the Drinkers resided in the city, but also performed agricultural labor for them during the summers, which the household spent at their plantation, Clearfield. Elizabeth Drinker thought that Brant was a good servant, but she observed that as Brant entered her teens, she began flirting ‚Äúand worse‚Äù with men. In 1794, sixteen-year-old Sally Brant became pregnant.Berkin, 101; Smith. When confronted by Elizabeth Drinker, Brant named the father as Joe Gibbs, a free black man who worked as the Drinkers‚Äô coach driver.Salinger, p. 501. Elizabeth Drinker reacted with ‚Äúgreat anxiety of mind,‚Äù anger, and embarrassment. The Drinkers fired Gibbs to limit his further interaction with Brant,Smith, Women's Roles, p. 20] but they did not press any charges against him in court. Embarrassed by her servant's conduct, Elizabeth Drinker forced Brant to leave Philadelphia to give birth in Clearfield, in Germantown, Pennsylvania which was then a largely rural area well beyond the Philadelphia city limits. When the child was born in March 1795, Brant named her Hannah Gibbs, thereby acknowledging her daughter's paternity.Smith, p. 20. This further angered Drinker because Brant seemed to show no remorse over her actions. Elizabeth Drinker complained in her diary that \\"(Brant) appears to be full of Glee as if nothing ailed her\\".Smith, p. 19 Drinker changed the child's name to Catherine Clearfield, to obscure her parentage, and refused to let Joe Gibbs see his daughter.Smith, p. 20] When Brant was brought back to the Drinker home in Philadelphia, her daughter remained in Germantown in the charge of a series of wet nurses.Smith, Women's Roles p. 20-21 First, Mary Courtney, the wife of the Drinkers‚Äô gardener, cared for the baby for a short time, until the new gardener's wife, Mrs. George Fry, replaced her. When the Frys tired of the responsibility, Drinker contracted with Sally Morris, a black woman, to nurse the baby. Brant's daughter died at seven months old. Historian Merrill Smith, claims that \\"Elizabeth [Drinker] may have felt a little guilty, she believed she had done her duty and acted responsibly in her capacity as Sally's mistress.\\"Smith, 20-21. As was common practice with indentured servitude in Pennsylvania, Brant was required to serve additional time, beyond her original contract of indenture, to pay for the expenses of her pregnancy, her recovery after birth, and the cost of the nurses hired to care for her child. Sally Brant left the Drinkers after fulfilling 8 years of service, on June 15, 1796, then 18 years old.  After indentured servitude  In 1798, Brant married a barber with the last name of Shearer, and had at least three more children. She continued to visit the Drinker household regularly for several years, until at least 1806.Smith, Women's Roles, p. 20-21. When the Drinkers' great- grandson, Henry Drinker Biddle, published an edited version of Elizabeth's diary in 1889, he left out key aspects of Sally Brant's experiences as Elizabeth had recorded them. Historians without access to Drinker's complete diary long assumed that Sally Brant and Joe Gibbs were both white. It served as a vivid illustration of the lack of control that indentured servants, especially women, had over their lives. Following the recovery of the original diary, Brant's story is now also recognized as a rare and important example of the consequences that an illicit, mixed-race relationship carried for an eighteenth-century servant.

The settlement was located at Choctaw Bend on the Mississippi River. History The Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 began at this break in the Mississippi River levee at Mound Landing. The area was settled in 1840 by William P. Perkins, who used slave labor to clear of canebrakes on which he established Mound Plantation, a cotton plantation. Mound Plantation and its river landing were named for three nearby Indian mounds. Perkins eventually owned of land at the settlement and, by 1850, was Bolivar County's largest land owner and one of the United States' largest slaveholders. Mound Landing had a post office as early as 1880. In 1886, the population of Mound Landing was 50. A levee was erected in 1867 to protect the settlement from river flooding. The levee was locally financed, and subsequent improvements to the levee were made. A ferry landing was located at the settlement, with a ramp which permitted vehicles to pass over the top of the levee. In April 1927, as water levels on the Mississippi River began to rise due to heavy rains, an unknown number of Negro prisoners were brought in chains to Mound Landing by the National Guard to fill sandbags at gunpoint in an effort to reinforce the levee. On April 21, the levee at Mound Landing broke, killing at least 100 prisoners and carrying their bodies several miles from the settlement. The Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 was one of the most damaging floods in the United States, inundating of land in the Mississippi Delta, taking 246 lives, and displacing 700,000 people.

It was released in 1986 by Ocean Software in Europe and Mindscape in North America. The game was named after its primary graphical feature, parallax scrolling, which gives the illusion of depth to side-scrolling video games. On release, reviews praised the game's mix of traditional side-scrolling action and adventure game-inspired puzzles.  Gameplay  On a routine exploratory mission, five astronauts discover a friendly-seeming planet run by an artificial intelligence. The inhabitants drop their pretense of friendship after the astronauts uncover a plan to invade Earth. Four of the astronauts are captured, and the player takes control of the fifth, who must free his companions and stop the invasion.Parallax game manual, page 5. Ocean Software. Gameplay is split between two modes. The main part of the game is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up aboard a spaceship. The player scores points by destroying enemy ships and turrets. At hangars, the player can land and exit the spaceship. In this action-adventure mode, the player drugs enemy scientists and retrieves keycards to unlock the password to advance to the next of five zones. The first scientist drugged in each zone also counts as a rescued astronaut. Once the password is unlocked in the fifth zone, the computer controlling the invasion shuts down, and the player wins.  Development  Parallax was Sensible Software's first game. It was designed after signing an agreement with publisher Ocean Software; Ocean was the first publisher Sensible approached. The founders, programmer Chris Yates and artist Jon Hare were 19 years old at the time. Yates came up with the initial concept of a shoot 'em up game where players could fly above and below platforms. Hare designed the levels and graphics, and Yates added additional effects, such as sliding walls. The puzzle elements were planned to be more complex, but the Commodore 64's limited memory did not allow it. The ending of the game, which simply outputs \\"System Off\\", was all they could fit in the remaining memory. Programming the game took six months, and it was released in October 1986. The game's score was inspired by Jean-Michel Jarre's album Rendez-Vous, which composer Martin Galway had been listening to during development.  Reception  Contemporary reviews were positive and highlighted Parallaxs combination of shoot 'em up action and adventure-inspired puzzles. Zzap!64 rated the game 93/100 and called it \\"a neat mix between shoot em up and an arcade adventure, with a few other things thrown in for good measure\\". Lee Noel, Jr. of Compute!'s Gazette wrote that the game has \\"excellent graphics\\" and simulates depth and perspective well. Describing the gameplay, Noel said it initially seems like \\"just basic components of a fairly good shoot 'em up\\" but later incorporates elements of adventure games, though stripped of their characterization and complex interactions. Noel concluded, \\"Although it's not particularly deep or complex, Parallax and its arcadelike graphics present an entertaining and incredibly challenging puzzle.\\" In a 1988 roundup of space combat games, David W. Wilson of Computer Gaming World praised the mix of genres, calling it the game's \\"cleverest aspect\\". The Australian Commodore and Amiga Review, in a 1990 roundup of shoot 'em up games, wrote that Parallax \\"hasn't mellowed with age and still impresses as much as it did then\\". The review called it a \\"special blend of strategy and action\\", rating it 90/100. Eurogamer's retrospective review from 2006 rated it 7/10 stars and said that it has \\"intriguing gameplay variety\\" and \\"neat parallax effects\\", though it is not the most technically advanced Commodore 64 game. The reviewer, Dan Pearson, criticized the game's ending, writing that it must have seemed anti- climactic to anyone who won it. Author Roberto Dillon wrote that the game's chiptune score differentiated it from other games and has become popular with retrogamers. Pearson called the main theme \\"truly demented but utterly mesmerising\\".

A keen traveller, she noted the distress and suffering around her, more particularly in the \\"Jewish Quarters\\" of the towns through which she passed, and was ever ready with some plan of alleviation. Her privately printed journals, threw light upon her character, and showed her to be cultured, imbued with a strong religious spirit, true to the teachings and observances of the Jewish faith, yet exhibiting the widest acceptance of those espousing other beliefs. She was quick to resent any indignity or insult that might be offered to her religion or her people. Montefiore authored the first Jewish cook book written in English. Early years Judith Barent Cohen, fourth daughter of Levy Barent Cohen and his wife, Lydia Diamantschleifer, was born in London on 20 February 1784. The father, of Angel Court, Throgmorton Street, was a wealthy Ashkenazi or German Jew. Career She married Sir Moses Montefiore on 10 June 1812. Marriages between Sephardim and Ashkenazim were not approved by the Portuguese Synagogue; but Moses believed that this caste prejudice was hurtful to the best interests of Judaism, and was desirous of abolishing it. There is little doubt that that marriage did more than anything else to pave the way for the present union of English Jews. They were married on 10 June 1812, and took a house in New Court, St. Swithin's Lane, next door to one Nathan Maier Rothschild, living there for 13 years. This was likely Nathan Mayer Rothschild, founder of the Rothschild banking family of England, whom one of her sisters, Hannah (1783‚Äì1850), had married in 1806. Her prudence and intelligence influenced all her husband's undertakings, and when he retired from business, the administration of his fortune in philanthropic endeavours was largely directed by her. Lady Montefiore accompanied her husband in all his foreign missions up to 1859, and was the beneficent genius of his memorable expeditions to the Holy Land, Damascus, Saint Petersburg, and Rome. By her linguistic abilities, she was enabled to materially assist her husband in his self-imposed tasks. During the journey to Russia, in 1846, she was indefatigable in her efforts to alleviate the misery she saw everywhere around her. The wife and daughter of the Russian governor paid her a ceremonious visit and expressed the admiration she had inspired among all classes. Her sympathies were greatly widened by travel; two journals of some of these travels were published anonymously by her. It was also during this period that Montefiore authored and had published the first English language Jewish cookbook,. The last years of her life were spent alternately in London and Ramsgate. Later years For some years her health had been so bad that they had spent much of their time in Europe in the hope of improving it, but she had at last become too weak to undertake the journeys, and her last days were spent in England. Only a few months prior to her decease, the couple had celebrated their golden wedding anniversary, and this period was marked by what seemed a partial restoration of her health. On 24 September 1862, after exchanging blessings with her husband, she fell into her last sleep. Lady Judith died 24 September 1862. At her death, Sir Moses founded in her memory the Judith Lady Montefiore College at Ramsgate. References =Attribution=  * =Bibliography= *Jew.

Early life and education The son of Christopher Serpell, James Serpell was born in Rome, Italy on February 16, 1952. He attended University College London where he received his bachelor's degree in Zoology in 1974. He then completed a PhD in Animal Behavior at the University of Liverpool in 1980. Career After graduating he went to the University of Cambridge and established the Companion Animal Research Group there in 1985. He moved to the University of Pennsylvania in 1993 and teaches there currently. While at the University of Pennsylvania he was part of creating C-BARQ, the first standardized dog behavioral assessment survey. Serpell's scholarship and research in the area of anthrozoology is unusual in ranging broadly, including publications on anthropology and the humanities, as well as scientific prospective studies of human-animal interactions. His early book, In the Company of Animals, remains the classic work providing a broad overview of human-animal interactions. Similarly, his edited book, The Domestic Dog (now in 2nd edition) is unquestionably the primary source on dogs' behavior and our interactions with them. Among his many classic research papers is one (the first) documenting increased walking by new Cambridge pet owners after adopting a puppy. Another early study helped explain the source of the widespread compatibility that pet owners feel with their dogs, despite various behavior problems. Serpell's scholarly leadership was recognized already in 1992 when he was presented the IAHAIO/ISAZ Distinguished Scholar Award. He is a primary leader and founder of the International Society for Anthrozoology (ISAZ), which publishes Anthrozoos.

Description The Commission consists of one member from each of the NEC states and the District of Columbia; four members from Amtrak; and five members from the U.S. Department of Transportation. The Commission also includes non-voting representatives from four freight railroads, states with feeder corridors, and commuter authorities not directly represented by a Commission member. The Commission approved a Northeast Corridor Commuter and Intercity Rail Cost Allocation Policy (the Policy) in 2015 as a first step towards establishing a new framework for regional cooperation. The Policy employs consistent and transparent methods for sharing about $1 billion in annual operating and baseline capital costs among infrastructure owners and service operators. In addition, the Policy calls for a collaborative capital planning process among stakeholders, new performance reporting requirements, and a federal-state funding partnership to eliminate the $28 billion state-of-good repair backlog and address improvement needs not funded through the Policy. Congressional passage of the FAST Act in December 2015 represented a significant step forward for the NEC. It marked the first time that intercity passenger rail was addressed in a multi-year authorization alongside other surface transportation programs and it codified many of recommendations included in the Policy aimed at increasing collaboration, transparency, and accountability for all NEC stakeholders.

Using 360 degree tracking equipment such as infrared sensors, the VR system monitors the user's movement in all directions, and translates this into the virtual world in real-time. This allows the player to perform tasks, such as walking across a room and picking up a key from a table, using natural movements. In contrast, a stationary VR experience might have the player navigate across the room using a joystick or other input device. The HTC Vive virtual-reality system incorporates room-scale tracking in its core design, using two infrared tracking stations located in opposite corners of the room to monitor the movement of the player. The Oculus Rift VR system was introduced primarily for front facing 180 degree experiences.

Pak represented the Workers' Party of North Korea (WPNK) and after 1949 the unified Workers' Party of Korea (WPK). She was already an experienced communist at the time of the liberation of Korea, and she had also studied in the Soviet Union and worked for its intelligence service. She is grouped variously among either the Soviet or the Domestic faction of the party. Pak was the first chairperson of the North Korean Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Women's League, the country's mass organization for women. During her chairwomanship the League had not yet developed into an organization through which the government tightly controls its citizens. Pak is the only woman to have served in the Politburo of the Workers' Party of Korea. She has been characterized as being the only woman ever to have been truly important in the WPK. Her career in North Korean politics stretched from the 1940s until her purge in 1966 which resulted in her expulsion to countryside. From there on she was allowed to hold minor positions only. Pak was awarded with the International Stalin Prize in 1950. Early life and career Pak was born in 1907 in North Hamgyong Province in the north of the Korean Peninsula. She went to the Soviet Union to study in the Moscow State University. She then worked for the Soviet Union as an intelligence agent before entering politics. In the early 1930s, she was dispatched to Korea for duty, where the Japanese authorities imprisoned her. 1st Congress of the WPNK on 28 August 1946, two days before becoming a full member of its first Central Committee During the 1940s, Pak was married to Kim Yong-bom, chairman of the North Korean Branch Bureau of the Korean Communist Party. At the time of the liberation of Korea, Pak was already considered an experienced domestic communist. She supported Kim Il-sung in the early days of North Korean political life and became one of his strongest supporters. In August 1946, she became a full member of the 1st Central Committee of the Workers' Party of North Korea (WPNK). When the Workers' Parties of North and South Korea merged to form the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) in 1949, Pak was chosen as one of its three secretaries. She served in its 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Central Committees. She was also a deputy to the Supreme People's Assembly. It is possible that Pak informed the Chinese about North Korea's plans to attack South Korea just prior to the outbreak of the Korean War. In 1953, she headed the North Korean delegation to Stalin's funeral in Moscow, where her Chinese counterpart was the Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai. Later that year, she participated in a purge against the former South Korean Workers' Party members who had fallen out of Kim Il-sung's favor. Pak became one of five members, and the only woman, in a Political Committee that solidified Kim's rule. Pak was highly influential within the Committee and was one of Kim's closest confidantes. She was present when he signed the Armistice document and also accompanied him on trips abroad. As one of the most important members of the Committee she was uniquely \\"able to advise Kim Il- s≈èng on his personal life, and to speak for women as well as on matters of general concern\\". She was the first chairperson of the North Korean Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Women's League. During her tenure, lasting from the 1940s to 1965, the league was a typical women's mass organization not unlike those in other countries. It was only under subsequent chairpersons that it acquired more totalitarian features. Pak also played a leading role in the Women's International Democratic Federation (WIDF). She was a member of its Executive Committee in 1948. In 1951, a WIDF International Commission of Women visited North Korea on her initiative to mobilize the world public opinion. She received the International Stalin Prize in 1950 and also starred in Joris Ivens and Jerzy Bossak's anti-war documentary film Peace Will Win. She has also revived the North Korean Order of the National Flag, both first and second class. Robert A. Scalapino and Lee Chong-Sik call her \\"the only woman ever to have been truly important in the [WPK]\\". She lasted in mid- century North Korean political life when purges removed many other senior politicians. Andrei Lankov describes her as \\"one of the most remarkable personalities of that remarkable era\\". From 1961 to 1963 she was North Korea's Minister of Agriculture. Pak is the only woman to have served in the Politburo of the Workers' Party of Korea, the highest decision-making body of the party. Pak herself was purged by Kim at the 2nd Conference of the WPK in October 1966. The conference saw purges of mostly officials in charge of economic affairs, but Pak was not one of them, implying that she was purged because of Kim's desire to concentrate power. Pak was expelled to the countryside after the purge. She resurfaced in public life in 1986. Her influence had been greatly weakened by then and she was allowed to hold minor positions only. Her daughter, Pak Sun-hui, is the current chairperson of the central committee of the Korean Democratic Women's League.

When the organization was formed in 1916, few female rangers worked within its ranks. As the organization grew, more women were hired into white-collar and clerical positions. As social activism and second-wave feminism movements gained ground in the 1960s and 70s, women were hired into more diverse occupations and leadership roles within the NPS. Today, the National Park Service still faces a gender disparity with 37% of the workforce being female and has been criticized for its response to several sexual harassment cases.http://now.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Issue-Advisory-Change- Demanded-for-Widespread-Sexual-Harassment-in-National-Park-Service.pdf  Early female rangers  Female rangers existed in the early 20th century in small numbers. Because of the rarity of encountering a female employee, these women's careers were often highly publicized. Many early female rangers were the wives or daughters of male NPS employees. One example was the story of a Mrs. Cal Peck, who met her husband, a ranger at Yellowstone National Park, when she visited the site as a tourist. The Pecks both went on to work as Park rangers at the Grand Canyon in 1922, where \\"her patrol is on the north side of the Grant Canyon running into Arizona, amid the most beautiful scenery of the park.\\" Instead of a standardized uniform, Mrs. Peck wore a brown, homemade animal skin uniform during for her patrol. Another fairly well-known figure in the 1920s was Marguerite Lindsley, a junior student at Montana State College and the daughter of Yellowstone's assistant superintendent, who was popularly known as the \\"first woman ever to be named as a ranger at Yellowstone National Park.\\" Lindsley's main qualification for the position was that she had \\"spent every summer of her life in the park\\", and thus familiar with not only the hills and valleys of the park, but with the birds and \\"beasts\\" as well. Other women were able to have brief careers with the Park Service due to the scarcity of available male employees, particularly during times of war. Claire Marie Hodges, known as the first female ranger at Yosemite National Park, was hired as a seasonal ranger in the summer of 1918, when the park was facing a shortage in able-bodied young men due to World War I. Unusually, Hodges had the same duties, and wore the same stetson hat and badge as her male colleagues, although she did not carry a gun. Historian Polly Welts Kaufman writes of the contributions of these early women park rangers, stating that \\"Although women... who did achieve park ranger status before the early 1970s have gone down in Park Service history as the first women rangers, they did not bring real change to the position of women in the Service. But they did demonstrate that women could do the job...\\" = Ranger wives = Although not employees themselves, many ranger wives had great influence over their husbands and, at times, the parks they called home. Horace Albright, the second director of the NPS, even described ranger wives more as \\"charming and versatile, competently to carry out, within the limits of their strength, their husband's varied assignments.\\"Margaret Becker Merrill, Bears in my Kitchen (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1956), xi. Some ranger wives also wrote about their experiences. Bears in My Kitchen was the memoir of Margaret Merrill, who had been a ranger wife at Yosemite from 1930 until the book was published in 1956. Other women participated more directly. Helen Hartzog, wife of NPS Director George B. Hartzog Jr., became popularly known as the \\"First Lady\\" of the National Park Service due to her involvement with the organization. She acted as a trusted advisor for her husband during his tenure as director, fostered an increased sense of community within the growing organization, and assisted with the growth of the NPS's burgeoning Volunteers In Parks (VIP) program.  Expansion of the National Park Service  Gender relations within the Park Service changed dramatically in the 1960s and 1970s, as the expansion of the NPS coincided with New Left social movements and second wave feminism. In 1960, the National Park Service issued a written statement on employment, urging officials to consider applicants based on qualifications and regardless of gender. However, the same directive goes on to state \\"women cannot be employed in certain jobs, such as Park Ranger or Seasonal Park Ranger...in which the employee is subject to be called to fight fires, take part in rescue operations, or do other strenuous or hazardous work...\\" but that \\"[p]articipation by women employees in lecture programs, guided tours, museum and library work, and in research programs would be entirely appropriate and very helpful in many Parks. Increased attention may also be given to children's programs in some Parks and to extension work to schools for which women interpretive employees may be even more effective than men.\\" Another step came nationally in 1962, when Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy invalidated an old law that allowed appointments to specify by gender. As the Service itself expanded and interpretive functions began to take increased precedence, more and more women were employed. Sometimes not referred to as \\"rangers\\", many of these employees were instead called park naturalists, historians, or information guides until the term \\"ranger\\" was finally used institutionally to describe women in 1971.Kaufman, Polly Welts. \\"Women in the National Park Service.\\" Ranger: The Journal of the Association of National Park Rangers Vol. I, No. 4 (Fall 1984): 7. Women began to steadily make up more of the workforce throughout the last decades of the 20th century. In 1969, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) enacted new standards intended to remove gender specific qualifications. Title IX was enacted in 1972, and more women were able to gain the qualifications needed to be employed with the Park Service. After legal action, a five-foot eight-inch height requirement for the U.S. Park Police was removed in 1972, and women began receiving training for Law Enforcement positions at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in 1975. Women entering the Park Service did face push-back from male colleagues and visitors. Women were sometimes referred to as \\"Rangerettes\\" and \\"Nature Fakers.\\" An historian and former Superintendent of Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, Melody Webb stated that she stated that \\"it didn't occur to me that being a woman made any difference. It did, \\"and that women in the NPS \\"took getting used to.\\" = Women and the NPS uniform = Early uniform standardization measures failed to include any guidelines for female employees.R. Bryce Workman, National Park Service Uniforms: Ironing Out the Wrinkles, 1920‚Äì1932 (A Publication of the National Park Service History Collection, Office of Library, Archives and Graphic Research. Harpers Ferry, West Virginia: Harpers Ferry Center, 1995), vi. The first version of a female ranger uniform emerged in 1947, modeled after the Women's Auxiliary Army Corps military uniform, reflecting the early NPS's connection with the military. In the 1960s, the uniform was updated to closely model those worn by American Airlines flight attendants. Complaints over the stewardess-type uniform led to a NPS initiative to redesign the female uniform in 1970. The result was a tan uniform complete with short skirt and go-go boots. After this was deemed impractical, it was replaced with two options, a wildly unpopular \\"A line\\", or \\"McDonald's\\" uniform and what was called the \\"Women's Traditional Uniform\\", which was basically the same as the men's. Finally, in 1978, women were authorized to wear the modern \\"green and gray\\" uniform. Women were also unable to wear the NPS badge until 1978, instead being issued a small arrowhead pin to attach to their uniforms.R. Bryce Workman, National Park Service Uniforms: Badges and Insignia, 1894‚Äì1991 (A Publication of the National Park Service History Collection, Office of Library, Archives and Graphic Research. Harpers Ferry, West Virginia: Harpers Ferry Center, 1991), 14-18.  Modern controversy  As the NPS celebrated its Centennial in 2016, issues with diversity and gender relations are still present. = Continued lack of diversity = In 2015, women made up only 37% of the National Park Service workforce. In Law Enforcement positions, only 15% of employees were female.Jan Erikson and Luna Floyd, \\"ISSUE ADVISORY ‚Äì Change Demanded for Widespread Sexual Harassment in National Park Service\\", August 5, 2016. = Accusations of sexual harassment = Recently, a number of sexual harassment cases involving female employees of the National Park Service have come to light, leading the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee to characterize the issue as pervasive. Reports of systematic sexual harassment in the River District of Grand Canyon National Park spoke of a culture that not only ignored reports of harassment, but made women fear retribution if they took steps to file charges or demand consequences for their assailants. A widely read article in the Huffington Post, \\"Out Here, No One Can Hear You Scream\\", described the allegations in detail. Since then, women who were or are employed at many different parks have gone public with their stories of sexual harassment, including Canaveral National Seashore, Death Valley National Park, Yosemite National Park, and Yellowstone National Park https://www.doioig.gov/reports/investigative-report-sexual-misconduct-law- enforcement-supervisor- canaveral-national.; http://www.hcn.org/issues/48.21/how-the-park-service-is-failing-women; https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/09/22/top-park-service- official-acknowledges-no-one-has-been-fired-for-sexual-misconduct/ In the spring of 2016, NPS officials declared a \\"zero tolerance\\" policy on sexual harassment within the organization. But Congress committee members in September accused the Service of failing to take allegations seriously. In June 2016, Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell admitted that the current reports of sexual harassment in the National Park Service were probably \\"just the tip of the iceberg.\\"  Notable female NPS employees  Among the women who held leadership and upper-level management positions within the National Park Service, or had a strong influence on National Park Service policy or gender relations, are: Early superintendents (not comprehensive)Prepared by Harold Danz, author of Historical Listing of NPS Officials.

Name The museum is dedicated to those who were comfort women during the Japanese rule of Taiwan. Ama means grandmother in Taiwanese Hokkien, referring to the advanced age of those who had survived World War II. History The original idea to establish the museum started in 2004. Supported by a large donation from the public in and outside Taiwan, as well as the Taipei Women's Rescue Foundation (TWRF), the museum plaque was unveiled in a ceremony on 8 March 2016 in conjunction with International Women's Day. The ceremony was attended by President Ma Ying-jeou and one former comfort woman. The museum was finally opened on 10 December 2016 in a ceremony attended by Culture Minister Cheng Li-chun in conjunction with Human Rights Day and the 25th anniversary of the efforts made by the foundation towards comfort women. Speaking during the ceremony, Cheng urged people to never forget the past and to strive for better gender equality. Chairperson of TWRF said that the museum would also be a place to promote gender equality and highlight the damages made by sexual abuse. The ceremony was also attended by one surviving Taiwanese comfort woman and advocates from Japan, South Korea and the United States. The Taipei Women's Rescue Foundation announced in July 2020 that the Ama Museum would close in November 2020. The museum had operated at a loss since it opened in 2016, and the TWRF sold its offices in 2019 in an effort to keep the museum running. However, the COVID-19 pandemic reduced the museum's income further, leading to the decision to close it. Architecture The museum is housed in a renovated 90-year-old 2-story building with a total floor area of 495 m2. It features a caf√© and workshop space. Exhibition The museum permanently displays photos, documents and videos related to Taiwanese comfort women. Activities The museum is used as the venue to host various workshops and seminars on topics related to human rights. In August 2017, the museum launched a campaign to pressure the Government of Japan through the Japan‚ÄìTaiwan Exchange Association to apologize and compensate the remaining comfort women.

It is located 125 km towards east from the district headquarters Aizawl, which is also the State capital of Mizoram. Phullen is a Block headquarters of Phullen Block, which is bounded by Darlawn Block towards west, Ngopa Block towards East, Thingsulthliah Block toward south, and Aizawl district sharing boundary with manipur state in north. History Phullen (earlier Khandaih) was founded by Mizo Chief Vanphunga Sailo, the son of Pawihbawiha Sailo in 1901. After Vanphunga Sailo, his eldest son Awksarala Sailo became the Chief. He ruled Phullen until his death. Khandaih was considered the biggest village in Mizoram when the British first acquired the land. The village was given importance and was often visited by British officials. The first permanent mission school was established in 1903. It was visited by the Dy Commissioner J Hezlett, ICS in 1912 where Chief Vanphunga welcomed him. The Dy Commissioner told the chief, \\"Vanphung, ask for anything and I shall give it to you.\\" Vanphunga replied without any prior thought, \\"As I have several sons, I ask that the rolling range from where River Tuivawl intercepts with River Tuivai to the point where River Tuivawl flows along all the way to River Tuivai be gifted to me so that my sons could branch out in these places.\\" The Dy Commissioner granted this request. Khandaih: The first permanent school in Mizoram rural was established on 1 August 1903 at Khandaih with the permission of Vanphunga Sailo, the chief of Khandaih. The numbers of student enrolled in Khandaih School is 116. The school was also used for preaching Gospel. Hrangsaipuia, son of Vawmhmelthaa was its first school teacher. This is also a place where the first Christian revival took place in Mizoram on 8 April 1906 which was called Khandaih Harhna For this reason the reigning chief of Khawlek, a Rahsi named Hrangchhunga moved to Dwarbawn. At age 56, Vanphunga passed away at the village of his concubine, Zawngin in 1922 due to ‚ÄòDawrnget‚Äô disease. Even though Vanphunga was known for persecuting Christians, he died after converting. Dawrnget disease is what we presently understand as ‚Äòpile problem‚Äô. It is said that Sailo chiefs ate too much of meat and many died at a young age. Successor Awksarala shifted to a higher and a more comfortable hill in 1926. This hill was called Phullen Hill. So, Khandaih was renamed to Phullen. Demographics Phullen has a population of 1911 of which 954 are males while 957 are females as per Population Census 2011. The population of children with age 0-6 is 288, or 15.07%. The average sex ratio is 1003, which is higher than Mizoram, as it has a state average of 976. The child sex ratio is 1102, which is also higher than Mizoram, with an average of 970. Phullen has a higher literacy rate than the Mizoram average. In 2011, the literacy rate was 96.24% compared to 91.33% of Mizoram. The male literacy rate stands at 96.45% while the female literacy rate was 96.03%. Culture The population of Phullen is made up of different ethnic groups. The culture of the Mizo tribes and its social structure has changed since the arrival of Christianity in Mizoram. Peoples of Phullen celebrate Christmas festival, New Year, Chapchar Kut and other Christian celebrations replacing many tribal customs and practices. Christianity plays an important role in their cultural, religious and socio-political structure. One such cultural element was Hnatlang, which literally means social work, united labour or community labour (the word hna‚Äò means job or work in the Mizo language; and tlang‚Äò means together and mutual). Tribal members who were absent from such social work (for reasons other than illness and disability) were penalised‚Äîa form of strong peer pressure. Jhum cultivation and raids on neighboring tribes required Hnatlang, the spirit of united labour and equal sharing of the end result. Administrative structure Phullen is headed by the Village Council President. Almost all issues regarding the village administration are under this authority. The President and Village Council Members exercised all matters of village administration with regards to law and order and development projects. Some aid groups such like Young Mizo Association (YMA) and Mizo Hmeichhe Insuihkhawm Pawl (MHIP) play an important role in social issues, which may reduce the burdens of the village council members.

A demo containing player and team creation tools was released on April 5, 2017. The game was released on May 5, 2017 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and Microsoft Windows via Steam on July 21. Gameplay AFL Evolution has three different career modes: the players can start as a coach, a listed player, or the created character. The coach mode revolves around running a team while handling tasks such as training schedules, finances and staff management. Besides playing single matches against the AI, up to four players can play online in multiplayer. ‚ÄòBe a pro‚Äô-type modes in games such as FIFA and NBA 2K allow the player to create a character and guide them through their career. You can start as an under 18, work your way up, play in the VFL and eventually get signed by an AFL team. the player will be able to leave after the season if they don't like the team their character is placed on, while also being able to start a career as an existing player or avoid the whole pre-AFL process entirely and jump straight into the elite competition. Also returning from AFL Live 2 is manager career mode, which is very similar to 'be a pro' mode in the way that you can start from the U18 TAC Cup and work your way up, or you can jump straight into the AFL. Manager career mode also takes gamers beyond the field of play allowing them to manage the team via the drafting and trading of players, the salary cap, training, the tribunal and much more. Online mode enables the players go head-to-head in competitive and co-operative online multiplayer. During the match, the player can pull off speckies, shown in slow motion from several angles. There are two camera angle views to be chosen from: default and end- to-end with two options in locked and dynamic. The dynamic option makes the rotation change, depending on the ball's current possession. At the bottom of the screen, a mini-map can be found that contains targets indicators. As the game has a full AFL license, AFL Women's, TAC Cup and Victorian Football League are integrated into the teams selection. All stadiums were faithfully replicated, along with the advertising and sponsors. In addition to that, AFL Evolution uses Seven Network's score graphics and commentary by Dennis Cometti and Matthew Richardson. Release On 3 May 2018, Wicked Witch Software launched a season pack which added the Western Australian Football League, the South Australian National Football League and the North East Australian Football League.

William Alexander, Archbishop of Armagh, caricatured in 1895, wearing a bishop's apron, gaiters and low-crowned shovel hat. The hat was usually made of black beaver or felt, and had a low, round crown and a wide brim, which projected in a shovel-like curve at the front and rear and was often worn turned up at the sides.Cumming (ed.) The Carlyle Encyclopaedia, FDUP, 2004, p.428Picken, A Dictionary of Costume and Fashion, 2013, p.167 Like the tricorne it was a development of the low-crowned broad-brimmed hats fashionable in the later 17th century. Along with the bishop's apron and gaiters, the shovel hat was an instantly recognisable accoutrement of senior Anglican clergy between the 18th and late 19th century, although it was also worn by parsons and less senior figures. By the mid 19th century it was already seen as somewhat traditionalist or old-fashioned: Carlyle coined the term \\"shovelhattery\\" to attack hidebound orthodoxy in the Church of England. The term \\"broad-brimmed\\", occasionally used to describe Anglican churchmen in the 19th century (particularly the Evangelical party) was also derived from the shovel hat.Bradshaw (ed) The voice of toil: nineteenth-century British writings about work, OUP, 2000, p.51 References Hats Anglican vestments Religious headgear ","title":"Shovel hat"},{"id":"52592077","text":"The Taiwan Stock Museum () is a museum in Songshan District, Taipei, Taiwan.

He was a founding member of the Muslim United Front (MUF) that contested the 1987 Legislative Assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir, and Ummat e Islami. He was a vocal advocate of freedom for Kashmiris. Early life Qazi Nisar Ahmad was born in 1952, the son of Qazi Ghulam Mohammed, who had earned the title of Fakhr Ul Waizeen (The Pride of Preachers) due to his social services in South Kashmir. The then Mirwaiz, Qazi Ghulam Mohammed was a son of Qazi Qamar-u-Din, who was seen as a wizard. His name is recorded as leading a protest against the autocratic Dogra Empire on 22 September 1933, when more than half a dozen demonstrators were shot dead by the regime's troops. Nisar's early education was in Nusrat ul Islam in Islamabad. In 1968 he topped the class 10th board exams in the state of Jammu Kashmir. He earned the highest score in Kashmir province in 1970 class 12thboard Exams. He later studied at Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) where his political activities came under scrutiny. He completed his M.A and M.Phil at AMU in Islamic Studies and also studied Law. He was awarded a Gold Medal for his efforts, receiving his Ph.D in 1985. He was the first Kashmiri to study at Al-Azhar University in Cairo, Egypt. Activism His activism started at age 19, when he was arrested for the first time for organizing a protest against the then Congressman, Mufti Mohammed Sayeed. He was bailed out after a week and was arrested again a month later. In 1985, he was jailed in Amphala jail for 6 months. He went to watch Indian Parliament proceedings where he bashed the parliamentarians in one of his best speech on the hanging of Mohammed Maqbool Bhat. He was perhaps one of the first people to observe 11 February as \\"Day of Reaffirmation\\" alongside Shakeel Bakshi, Nayeem Khan and Yasin Malik. in 1985 when he openly defied Governor Jagmohan‚Äôs dictate not to consume meat during a Hindu Festival, sacrificing two sheep in the main town square. In 1986, he was detained again. \\"In Central Jail alone more than 1000 against a capacity of low hundreds were lodged in central Jail Srinagar, 50 people were lodged in each cell against a capacity of 15-20 people\\" says Mohammed Saeed from Pahalgam. He was detained again for 7months in 1988 and 30months in 1990. Launched in 1985, after the escalation of human rights violations in Kashmir, The Khyri Aam Trust, spread across Kashmir , undertaking social work initiatives. The trust provided monthly compensation to widows of war and families of war victims. The trust operated across Southern Kashmir. They rehabilitated flood victims and provided temporary shelter to victims. He assisted in the marriage of more than 100 poor girls. Khyri Aam Members distributing relief at Czogam He was an enthusiastic human rights activist. He documented human rights violations in Kashmir and presented them to various human rights bodies including the Red Cross Society and Amnesty International. He presented memoranda to United Nations Members and Islamic Nations including Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq. He got FIRs registered in many inhumane killings, massacres and rapes. Ummat e Islami Qazi Nisar founded the socio-religious organisation, Ummat e Islami in 1985 as a collective resistance movement against the suspension of Muslim employees in the Kashmir Valley. \\"He was approached several times by Agencies from both India and Pakistan,\\" says Mir Muntazir, the General Secretary of the organisation. \\"He believed that people are his support and he needs no other. He did not swear allegiance to either of the two sides\\". The organisation died for lack of finance. \\"He was approached several times by members from both the sides. The Indian agencies approached through journalists, doctors, clerics at times which often got him agitated and because of that reason some journalists also wrote against him,\\" added Muntazir. Back to Kashmir Nisar returned to Kashmir in 1984 and worked at the Department of Arabic at Kashmir University. He quit the job and chose to work for his people. He served initially as a preacher at Magarmal Bagh in Srinagar, and after the death of his father, went to Islamabad to serve as the chief preacher there. He continued to preach there until he was assassinated by Pro India gunmen in 1994. Later he served a PSA in Kuthua Jail alongside Mohammed Ashraf Sahrai and Ghulam Nabi Sumji. Sehrai remembers those days as \\"toughest days of life\\" He recalls that Qazi Nisar was the first one who asked SP Kathua jail \\"to allow them to pray in congregation\\". The demand was refused but consequently agreed to after all of us hunger striked\\". Muslim United Front Nisar expressed unity with the president of Jamiat Ahli Hadith. Nisar led mass protests against the suspension of employees and the atrocities against Muslim employees. Abdul Ghani Bhat was also suspended that year. People across the state responded to the call for unity. All schools of thought came under a single banner on important occasions to offer prayers. This led to the formation of Ummat e Islami, whose slogan became \\"Aapka Maslak Aapko Mubarak\\". The unity show later spread to other parts of Jammu Kashmir when Abbas Ansari, the patron of Itehad ul Muslimeen, met Nisar at Islamabad. The party was later named Muslim United Front as proposed by Ghulam Qadir Wani. Muslim United front remains one of the least-documented chapters of Kashmir history. The apolitical group that mainly rose from Islamabad for the rights of the oppressed community in Jammu & Kashmir spread by late 1986 after Nisar's release on 2 November 1986 after he had been arrested for challenging the orders of Governor Jagmohan. Initially the group decided to focus on issues such as the Pregnancy Abortion Bill, by Shah Banoo Case. In the meantime, elections were underway in the state and some groups wanted the MUF to contest elections. After initial disagreements, the second vote slightly favoured that elections be contested. The elections were rigged. Nisar was the only candidate to speak in all 44 constituencies. He devised,hvbm,,the slogan \\"Dastgeer Souba Qalam Karun Haz Kamyaab\\" which was adopted by all the constituents of MUF including Jamaat e Islami.\\"Five people who became core members of 'Majlis-e- Muntazima' included Nisar, Molvi Abbas Ansari, Prof. Abdul Gani Bhat, Qadir Wani and Amir-e- Jam'aat Ghulam Mohammad Bhat. He became a leader of the Muslim United Front and his organisation came into the limelight.on Armed struggle Nisar was one of the first to support men such as Shakeel Bakshi, Ashfaq Majeed Wani, Mohammed Yasin Malik, and Nayeem Khan‚Ä¶ \\"we used to visit him in Magarmal bagh mosque, attend his friday sermons and discuss with him the strategies to fight with India\\", said Nayeem Khan. \\"He had close ties with Amanuallah Khan. Amanuallah Khan\\" says Hamidullah Bawani, the then vice chairman of Ummat e Islami. He had a close association with the JKLF , and its vice president Bashir Ahmed Bhat was his childhood friend. He used to lead the secret meetings that were held before events of armed struggle. Ashfaq used to visit Islamabad to meet Nisar which gave rise to the birth of an armed resistance struggle in Kashmir. Nisar was again one of the first to support armed resistance; in his speeches and writings he always supported the armed struggle. In one of his speeches he openly denounced the fatwa against HAJY Group of JKLF and denounced other Fatwas against Maqbool Bhat and other JKLF patriarchs. After the beginning of militancy in Kashmir, he was arrested, but as soon as he was released he organised a union between all militant groups that had been infighting since 1990. Two Britons, father and son that were kidnapped on 6June1994 at Pahalgam were released after his intervention, because he was respected among the militant groups for speaking out against human rights violations. He used to say ‚ÄúHarkat is my tongue, Hizb is my tongue, Ikhwan is my eye‚Äù. Scholar In 1984, he laid the foundation of the Islamic Research Institute where thousands of poor children received free education. He was an outspoken speaker and pursued Islamic education from Aligarh and Ashrafiya. He was an Islamic scholar and his Fatwa was accepted throughout the subcontinent and the Persian Gulf. Allama Arshid ul Qadri, one of the most versatile Indian scholars known as Ra‚Äôees ul Qalam once called him ‚ÄúThe hope of East‚Äù. He authored the books Tehqeeq i Nazar, Salwat un Nabi, Harkat ul Fikriyah, Nikah e Baligah and many others. He was the editor of m'onthly magazine hgfdIslamabad. He wrote poetry and authored many articles published in local, national and international newspapers. He stated ‚ÄúMy Deen does not side with oppressors‚Äô. He laid the foundation of many schools, libraries, and masjids that taught thousands of children. ‚ÄúMy aim is not to create a society of teachers, but to create a society that needs no teachers‚Äù His poetry often gave voice to the voiceless much like the Post Modern poets Yeti Draaw Hajas, tati Wolukh Gangae Musalmaan, Barbaad kor aem indrayi hind rajivn Musalmaan. Death On 19 June 1994, Nisar was assassinated by gunmen at Dialgam. His assassination resulted in a pro-New Delhi armed insurgency. Yasin Malik recalls \\"Dr. Qazi Nisar‚Äôs struggle and sacrifices cannot be ignored by anyone and today we all express our gratitude and love for this noble soul.

The Odagiri effect is a television phenomenon in which a program attracts a larger than expected number of women viewers because the program stars attractive male actors or characters. It is named after the Japanese actor Joe Odagiri, who starred in the 2000 show Kamen Rider Kuuga. The effect is now deployed deliberately in some shows, and is most commonly used in sports-themed and idol-themed anime. Origin The term \\"Odagiri effect\\" originated in Kamen Rider Kuuga, a show aimed at children. However, the producers discovered that the show was attracting two large audience groups: children between the ages of 4 and 12, at whom the show was originally aimed at; and women around the age of 30. The show was attracting the mothers of children who found lead actor Joe Odagiri attractive. Following this, Odagiri went on to a more high- profile career, while the follow-up series, Kamen Rider Agito attempted to re- create the effect by casting three attractive male actors in the lead. Again, the show attracted large numbers of women viewers, although long-term viewers, mostly men, disapproved. Use in anime The Odagiri effect is widely used in sports-themed and idol anime series. Among the shows where the effect has been claimed to have been identified include Kuroko's Basketball, Free!, Yowamushi Pedal, Days, The Prince of Tennis, Prince of Stride, All Out!!, Cheer Boys!!, Yuri on Ice, Hetalia: Axis Powers and Cute High Earth Defense Club Love!. Many of these shows attract fujoshi, yaoi fans, and to a lesser extent gay men. Use in western media Ian Wolf from Anime UK News has argued that the Odagiri effect is evident in TV shows and other media found in the west. Examples include the 2015 BBC production of Poldark which attracted large audiences due to depictions of lead actor Aidan Turner topless; the 2016 BBC production of The Night Manager which features a scene in which Tom Hiddleston naked buttocks is on-screen; and the erotic novel Fifty Shades of Grey. He has also argued Benedict Cumberbatch starring in the TV series Sherlock has caused the Odagiri effect to occur in other series he has appeared in such as the radio series Cabin Pressure. Paralleling the original example, the CBeebies show Mr Bloom's Nursery, a UK TV programme featuring Ben Faulks in the title role, became popular with a mature female audience. Positives and negatives of the effect The effect is said to have both a positive and negative effect. While such shows attract wider audiences, some critics claim that they \\"play it safe\\" and that: \\"Negative arcs about injury or lack of sportsmanship are resolved quickly and neatly, and while friendship abounds, romantic subplots are nowhere in sight. There's no incentive to risk alienating any of the target audiences, so the show stays away from tackling complicated themes.\\" Another positive effect of the Odagiri effect for anime producers is that female fans increase spending power, thus meaning they are more likely to buy merchandise relating to the series in question. There are also claims that the effect shows that there is sexism in program making. Reasons given include that a similar observable effect in which men were attracted to TV shows featuring attractive women actors and characters would be commented on differently. It is also argued that the effect shows that there is evidence that not enough programmes are being made targeting women.

As a young woman she was a political activist (KPD). Unlike her brother, she survived the Nazi years, but she nevertheless underwent several Gestapo interrogation sessions. During the early 1950s she held various senior positions within the East German print media sector even, at least on paper, after her retirement in 1955. Life Charlotte Scheffel was born in Gera, am industrial city to the west of Dresden with a large textiles sector, in which her mother worked as a \\"seamstress\\" (\\"N√§herin\\"). Her father was a painter. Scheffel left school in 1914 and embarked on a two-year traineeship in clothes manufacturing. Between 1917 and 1919 she worked as a clerical assistant in the city hall. From 1919 till 1921 she was employed in domestic service before moving on to a clerical position with the Gera Potash Syndicate. She lost that job in 1923 because of \\"Communist activities\\". She joined the Young Communists in 1922 and the Communist Party itself in 1924. In 1926 she married Paul Hohmann, a Communist Party official. She herself was employed as a secretary with the Sicla Building Co-operative in 1924/25. Between 1925 and 1930 she worked as chief secretary with the Schraps architectural practice, work which she combined with similar functions at the East Thuringia Building Business (\\"Bauh√ºttenbetrieb Ostth√ºringen\\") in Gera. She was also, by this time, contributing written material to labour movement publications. The Hohmanns relocated to Berlin in 1931. Hohmann embarked on a training at the Communist Party's national academy (\\"Reichsparteischule\\") in Berlin-Fichtenau (which had itself relocated from Dresden to Fichtenau in 1929). Next she became a senior official in the Women's Department of the Communist Party Central Committee. Between the end of 1931 and 1933 she was a volunteer and contributor to the newspaper for women, \\"Die K√§mpferin\\" (published by the party's Red Star publishing house). The Nazi power seizure in January 1933 was followed by a rapid switch to one-party dictatorship which put an end to Communist Party institutions in Germany and led to the imprisonment or forced emigration of the party leadership, although \\"underground activism\\" continued. Between 1933 and 1935 Charlotte Hohmann worked in a private dairy-delicatessen, while her apartment was used as an organisation hub for illegal Communist resistance fighters and couriers. Sources are vague on the details, which involved illegal \\"printing and postal\\" activities and accommodation for illegal party activists. Her husband was arrested in May 1933 after which Charlotte continued to work in illegal resistance, involved with the Saefkows, Werner Seelenbinder and the grouping around Felix Tucholla and her own brother, Rudolf Scheffel. Meanwhile, from 1936 she was employed as an office worker with \\"Wirtschaftsgruppe Elektro-Industrie\\", an industrial conglomerate, dismissed in 1942 on grounds of ill health. Between 1942 and 1945 she is described as a housewife. Her brother Rudolf was arrested in August 1942 and executed in September 1943. Between 1933 and 1944 she was several times interrogated by the Gestapo. War ended in May 1945 after which a large part of Germany surrounding Berlin was administered as the Soviet occupation zone (to be relaunched in 1949 as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany)). Between May and November 1945 Charlotte Hohmann worked for the city council in a management position in the Finance Department in Berlin- Sch√∂neberg. In February 1946 the local women's committee launched the weekly magazine \\"Die Frau von heute\\" (\\"Today's Woman\\"): Charlotte Hohmann was listed as Managing Editor. During 1948 control of the magazine passed to the newly established Democratic Women's League (\\"Demokratischer Frauenbund Deutschlands\\" / DFD). She continued to be identified as \\"Chefredakteurin\\" (\\"Editor in Chief\\") till 1957, although other job appointments indicate that in reality her day to day involvement with this publication may have diminished after 1948. Between 1948 and 1950 Hohmann worked as deputy managing editor of the weekly women's magazine \\"F√ºr Dich\\" (For Thee), under the editorship of Willi Karsch. (\\"F√ºr Dich\\" was subsumed into \\"Die Frau von heute\\" in 1950, although it re-appeared as a standalone title in 1963.) Between 1950 and 1955 Hohmann was employed in a senior management position (\\"Hauptgesch√§ftsfuehrerin\\") with the National Union of Journalists. She retired in 1955 but continued to undertake unpaid work for The Party. Charlotte Hohmann received her Medal for Fighters Against Fascism in 1958. She died in Berlin on 8 December 1971.

Early life Murray was born on August 9, 1713 in Unthank in Scotland. He was son of John Murray and Anne (n√©e Bennet) Murray, who married in April 1712. Among his siblings was John Murray (1721-1781) of Norwich and Elizabeth Murray (1726-1785), later Campbell, Smith, and Inman. Both John and Elizabeth were painted by John Singleton Copley.

His paternal grandfather was John Murray of Bowhill.  Life in America  In 1735, Murray emigrated from Scotland to the Province of North Carolina. When in North Carolina, he became a member of the North Carolina General Assembly and president of the Governor's Council. He established the Point Repose Plantation at Wilmington, North Carolina. Four of his six children with his first wife died on the plantation. After being thwarted in his efforts to become governor, Murray moved to Boston in 1765 and established various businesses. Prior to moving, however, Murray sent his oldest daughter Dorothy (who was also painted by Copley) to Boston to live with his sister Elizabeth. He turned the operation of the plantation over to his nephew, Thomas Clark, who became a Brigadier general in the Continental Army.

One evening she imbibed a large quantity of poppy-water and fell into a deep sleep from which she could not be wakened. An apothecary was consulted and it was concluded that Alice had died. William had urgent business in London and left instructions that her funeral should be deferred until his return. However, Alice‚Äôs relations considered that ‚Äúthe season of the year being hot, and the corpse fat, it would be impossible to keep her‚Äù, and she was accordingly buried without further delay. A few days later, boys who had been playing nearby reported hearing a voice from the grave. They were initially disbelieved but the voice was heard by others and the grave was opened. The body was found to be ‚Äúmost lamentably beaten‚Äù, which was thought to be the result of injuries inflicted by Alice on herself in her confinement. Being unable to detect any continuing signs of life, those present at the scene lowered Alice back into the grave overnight, with a view to summoning the coroner the next day. On their return, ‚Äúthey found she had torn off great part of her winding sheet, scratched herself first in several places, and beaten her mouth so long till it was all in gore blood.‚Äù She was at least definitely dead. The coroner found that her life had been thrown away and bound over several persons to appear at the Lent Assizes of 1675. Ultimately, no individuals were convicted but ‚Äúthe Town had a considerable fine set upon them for their neglect‚Äù.

It is usually prepared from either 2-bromopyridine, 2-chloropyridine, or 2-chloropyridine N-oxide, and is commercially available as both the neutral compound and its sodium salt. It is used to prepare zinc pyrithione, which is used primarily to treat dandruff and seborrhoeic dermatitis in medicated shampoos, though is also an anti-fouling agent in paints.  Preparation  The preparation of pyrithione was first reported in 1950 by Shaw and was prepared by reaction of 2-chloropyridine N-oxide with sodium hydrogensulfide followed by acidification, or more recently with sodium sulfide. 2-chloropyridine N-oxide itself can be prepared from 2-chloropyridine using peracetic acid. Another approach involves treating the same starting N-oxide with thiourea to afford pyridyl-2-isothiouronium chloride N-oxide which undergoes base hydrolysis to pyrithione. 2-Bromopyridine can be oxidised to its N-oxide using a suitable peracid (as per 2-chloropyridine), both approaches being analogous to that reported in Organic Syntheses for the oxidation of pyridine to its N-oxide. A substitution reaction using either sodium dithionite () or sodium sulfide with sodium hydroxide will allow the replacement of the bromo substituent with a thiol functional group. 350px The alternative strategy is to form the mercaptan before introducing the N-oxide moiety. 2-Mercaptopyridine was originally synthesized in 1931 by heating 2-chloropyridine with calcium bisulfide, an approach similar that first used to prepare pyrithione. The analogous thiourea approach via a uronium salt was reported in 1958 and provides a more convenient route to 2-mercaptopyridine. Oxidation to the N-oxide can then be undertaken. The disulfide dipyrithione, Pyrithione is found as a natural product in the Allium stipitatum plant, an Asian species of onion, also known as the Persian shallot. Its presence was detected using positive ion mass spectrometry using a Direct Analysis in Real Time ion source and the disulfide (2,2'-disulfanediylbis(pyridine)-1,1'-dioxide) has been reported from the same species. Dipyrithione can be prepared in a laboratory by oxidation of pyrithione with chlorine in the presence of sodium hydroxide: ::2 \\\\+ \\\\+ 2 NaOH -> \\\\+ 2 NaCl \\\\+ 2 Dipyrithione is used as a fungicide and bactericide, and has been reported to possess novel cytotoxic activity by inducing apoptosis.  Properties  Tautomerisation of the sodium salt of pyrithione (thione form on the left, thiolate form on the right) Pyrithione exists as a pair of prototropes, a form of tautomerism whereby the rapid interconversion of constitutional isomers involves the shift of a single proton, in this case between the sulfur and oxygen atoms (shown in the infobox). Salts of the conjugate base of pyrithione can also be considered to exhibit tautomerism by notionally associating the sodium ion with whichever heteroatom bears the negative charge of the anion (as opposed to the formal charges associated with the N-oxide); however, considering the anion alone, this could also be described as an example of resonance. Pyrithione is a weak acid with pKa values of ‚àí1.95 and +4.6 (thiol proton), but is a markedly stronger acid than either of its parent compounds (pyridine-N-oxide and pyridine-2-thiol), both of which have pKa > 8. It is only slightly soluble in water (2.5 g L‚àí1) but is soluble in many organic solvents (including benzene, chloroform, dichloromethane, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, and ethyl acetate) and slight solubility in others (diethyl ether, ethanol, methyl tert-butyl ether, and tetrahydrofuran). Pyrithione can be used as a source of hydroxyl radical in organic synthesis as it photochemically decomposes to HO‚Ä¢ and (pyridin-2-yl)sulfanyl radical.  Applications  The conjugate base of pyrithione is an anion containing two donor atoms, a sulfur atom and an oxygen atom each bearing a negative formal charge; the nitrogen atom remains formally positively charged. The thiolate anion can be formed by reaction with sodium carbonate, and zinc pyrithione is formed when zinc chloride is added. The anion can act as either a monodentate or bidentate ligand and forms a 1:2 complex with a zinc(II) metal centre. Zinc pyrithione has been used since the 1930s though its preparation was not disclosed until a 1955 British patent in which pyrithione was reacted directly with hydrated zinc sulfate in ethanol. In its monomeric form, zinc pyrithione has two of the anions chelated to a zinc centre with a tetrahedral geometry. In the solid state, it forms a dimer in which each zinc centre adopts a trigonal bipyramidal geometry with two of the anions acting as bridging ligands coordinated through the oxygen atoms in the axial positions. In solution, the dimers dissociate via scission of zinc- oxygen bonds to each bridging ligand. Further dissociation of the monomer into its constituents can occur and is undesirable as the complex is more potent in medical applications; for this reason, zinc carbonate can be added to formulations as it inhibits the monomer dissociation. Zinc pyrithione has a long history of use in medicated shampoos to treat dandruff and seborrhoeic dermatitis (dandruff can be considered a mild form of seborrheic dermatitis). It exhibits both antifungal and antimicrobial properties, inhibiting the Malassezia yeasts which promote these scalp conditions. The mechanisms by which this work are the subject of ongoing study. It can be used as an antibacterial agent against Staphylococcus and Streptococcus infections for conditions such as athlete's foot, eczema, psoriasis, and ringworm. It is known to be cytotoxic against Pityrosporum ovale, especially in combination with ketoconazole, which is the preferred formulation for seborrheic dermatitis. Pyrithione itself inhibits membrane transport processes in fungi. Paints used in external environments sometimes include zinc pyrithione as a preventive against algae and mildew.
