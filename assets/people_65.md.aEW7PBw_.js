Gun control was a major political issue in the first half of Clinton's first term and during that time he lobbied for, and signed, two major pieces of gun control legislation, the Brady Bill and the 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban.  Background  After receiving the Democratic nomination for president, Clinton campaigned against George H. W. Bush, in the fall of 1992. In the six previous elections, Republicans had garnered enormous success by labeling their opponents as \\"soft on crime\\". Democrats had not used gun control in the past as an election issue. Clinton reversed the tide by using gun control as an issue and calling Bush soft on crime for not pushing for passage of the Brady Bill or the nationwide assault weapons ban. Clinton also strongly endorsed the death penalty.Vizzard, William. Shots in the Dark. Lanham MD: Rowman & Littlefield, 2000. Bush called for \\" Going after the criminal not the gun owner\\". However, on March 15, 1989, less than two months after taking office, Bush temporarily banned, by executive order, the importation of various semi-automatic \\"assault weapons\\". That ban was extended a few weeks later to include additional firearms, and was made permanent by Bush in July, 1989. Clinton won the 1992 election with 43% of the vote.  Brady Bill  Soon after taking office, it was clear that one of the most important items on the domestic agenda for the President was to pass the Brady Bill. The bill was named after Ronald Reagan's press secretary James Brady, who was wounded during the attempt on Reagan's life by John Hinckley. Brady's wife, Sarah, became a gun control advocate, and sought to put restrictions on the purchasing on handguns. The bill had been introduced several times in Congress during the 1980s and early 1990s. President Bush had vetoed an earlier version of the bill after intense pressure from the National Rifle Association (NRA).Clinton, Bill. My Life. New York: Knopf Publishing Group, 2004. The Brady Bill became personal for President Clinton. He became a political ally with Sarah Brady in her quest to get the bill passed. Clinton also saw first hand what he believed was a need for the bill. When he was campaigning for Governor of Arkansas he met a hardware store owner who had sold a handgun to an unstable Vietnam vet, who had just been released from a mental hospital. The man went on a killing spree with the gun. Clinton cited this in his autobiography, as the best argument he encountered as to why the background checks in the Brady Law were needed. In February 1993 Clinton encouraged congress to pass the Brady bill, stating that he would sign it if they passed it. That same month Charles Schumer introduced the bill in the House and Howard Metzenbaum did so in the Senate.DeConde, Alexander. Gun Violence in America. York PA: Northeastern U. Press, 2001. Public opinion polls at the time showed a majority favored the bill. After several months of debate, the White House had put enough pressure on congress to get several Republican in both houses to support the bill. Despite last-ditch efforts by pro-gun Senators and the NRA, the bill managed to pass both houses and was signed into law on November 30, 1993.Anderson, Jack. Inside the NRA. Beverly Hills: Penguin, 1996. The law required a five-day waiting period after purchasing a handgun, and the dealer had to report the sale to the local chief law enforcement officer to run a check on the buyer. Clinton may have called the bill a \\"good beginning\\" for more gun control legislation. Many credit Clinton's skills at building coalitions and using the public stage to keep pressure on getting the bill passed.  Federal assault weapons ban  One year after signing the Brady Law, White House lobbying also played a role in the passage of the 1994 Crime Bill, which included the Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act, commonly known as the Federal Assault Weapons Ban. The law banned certain semi-automatic firearms with two or more specific design features, and also prohibited the manufacture of ammunition magazines that held over ten rounds.awbansunset.com Although initially heralded as a victory for Clinton and Democrats in congress, it proved costly. The bill energized the NRA and Republican base, and contributed to the Republican takeover of both houses in the 1994 mid-term elections. Many Democrats who had supported Clinton's gun control measures were ousted, including Speaker Tom Foley. Clinton acknowledged that he had hurt Democrats with his victories. Clinton continued to push further regulations of firearms in his second term, especially after the Columbine High School massacre. Little success came out of his efforts as Republicans controlled congress during this time, and a majority opposed any further gun control.At Clinton's urging, House votes to get back to work on gun control - March 15, 2000 The House voted to overturn the assault weapons ban in 1996, but the Senate failed to take up the issue.Senator Dianne Feinstein - Assault Weapons Ban  Lasting effects  Certain aspects of the Brady Bill were ruled unconstitutional in court (Printz v. United States), and the government now uses an instant check system instead of a five-day wait, but otherwise it survived and is still in effect today. Clinton claimed that the program had stopped thousand of criminals from purchasing guns. Critics pointed out that by 1999, of the more than 23,000 cases that had been referred for prosecution by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the BATF had only arrested 56 people. The assault weapons ban had a sunset clause and expired on September 13, 2004.  Executive Orders  During his term, President Clinton also used the power of executive orders to implement gun control policies. On April 6, 1998 Clinton signed an order that permanently banned the importation of more than 50 types of semiautomatic \\"assault weapons\\".Online NewsHour: Taking Aim - April 6, 1998 In 1999 White House domestic policy chief Bruce D. Reed said, \\"The country is tired of waiting for Congress to respond to the tragedy in Littleton. The administration is going to do every thing in its power to make progress on guns.\\" Many accused Clinton of overuse of the executive power on gun control issues.  Settlement with Smith & Wesson  In 2000 the Clinton administration reached an agreement with Smith & Wesson, to end federal and state lawsuits, in exchange for marketing and design changes by the company. Some of the items Smith & Wesson agreed to were; to sell guns with locks, to build the locks in the weapons within two years, implement smart gun technology, and take ballistic fingerprints of its guns.Smith & Wesson agrees to landmark gun safety settlement - March 17, 2000 Clinton called the deal a \\"major victory for America's families.\\" The NRA and other gun rights groups heavily criticized the settlement calling Smith & Wesson's actions \\"a sell- out\\",GOA Alert- March 21, 2000 with the NRA calling the agreement \\"\\"tantamount to back door blackmail\\". Smith & Wesson's ownership changed in 2001 and the agreement fell apart after George W. Bush came to office and supported lawsuit protection for gun manufactures. However, Smith & Wesson continues to sell guns with internal locks.

Antonio Mohedano (1561-1625) was a Spanish painter of the Renaissance period. It is assumed that he was born at Lucena, to a magistrate of Antequera, since he is referred to as a vecino of Antequera and a native (natural) of Lucena. He trained with Pablo de Céspedes, after his return to Córdoba in 1577. He started by painting \\" sargas\\" and the leathern hangings for rooms, which were then in general use. Having seen the frescoes of Julio and Alessandro, at Granada, and those of the Perolas, at El Viso, his admiration led him to copy many figures from those works, and to adopt that style of painting. Along with Alonso Vazquez, he painted frescoes for the great cloister of the Franciscans at Seville. In the Sacristy of Cathedral of Córdoba with the Perolas, he painted some now extant frescoes on devotional subjects. It is not known where Mohedano lived; he may have moved from city to city, and from convent to convent, halting wherever he found occupation for his pencil. His last years, however, were spent at Lucena, where he painted for the high altar for the principal church, and where he died. Two of his love-sonnets, of little interest, have been preserved in the anthology of his friend, Pedro de Espinosa, who also printed, in the same collection, a sonnet in his honour. References * A.

Geography  The village is located to the northwest of the province of Zamora, next to the Galician province of Orense, bordering the region of Viana, and close to the border with Portugal, at the same height as the historic region of Trás-os-Montes. It belongs to the so-called Alta Sanabria, a sub-region of the historical and traditional region of Sanabria. The towns of Aciberos, Chanos, Las Hedradas, Hedroso, Lubián and Padornelo are located within its municipal district. Its geographical location, adjacent to Galicia and close to Portugal, has made it one of the few bilingual municipalities in the province of Zamora, as its inhabitants regularly use Spanish and Galician. Its town center is crossed by the old N-525 road, now called ZA-106. There is also a new bypass of the N-525 and the A-52 or Rías Bajas highway.

History  In the Middle Ages, with the advance of the Reconquista, Lubián was integrated into the Kingdom of León, where it later remained, a fact which, during the Modern Age, the documentation explicitly mentions Lubián's belonging to the Adelantamiento of the Kingdom of León. There is a theory, based on the local oral tradition, that Lubián may have belonged to the Order of the Temple during medieval times, although the lack of documents does not allow any conclusive affirmation to be made in this regard. Already in the Contemporary Age, when the current provinces were created in 1833, Lubián was integrated into the province of Zamora, within which it is part of the Leonese Region.

According to the 2007 census (INE), the municipality has a population of 2,345 inhabitants. Geography and climate It is located near the river Duero, 5 km South of Zamora, in the Northern Plateau (700 m above sea level) of the Iberian Peninsula. Other cities that are near Morales del Vino are Salamanca, 56 km to the South, and 100 km to Valladolid. Not too far is Portugal, 60 km. The landscape is mainly flat, with no hills around. The village is surrounded by a continental cereal, legume and sunflower farm land, with some irrigated areas close to the river where maize, sugarbeet and sunflowers are also cropped. There are not large forests around, although some scattered trees in the fields can be found in the rainfed land or some other riverside forests are near the Duero. In the area of the municipality you can find the 'Soto de Pontejos' poplar forests, with wild asparagus plants growing under the trees and among other thorny shrubs. As the province of Zamora is located in the Northern Plateau of Spain, Morales has a Mediterranean- Continental climate. The main traits are the cold winters (-12 °C) and the hot summers (40 °C) and a long dry and sunny period around the summer only interrupted by some thunderstorms and some frequent rain in Spring and Autumn mainly. Some snow can happen in the winter but the most frequent phenomenon during winter is the fog that stays in the Duero valley producing very cold days (0 °C during the day, -5 °C during the night) with no sunshine for periods longer than one week. Apart from those days, sunshine in Morales is the predominant phenomenon. Etymology The translation into English of the town name is 'Mulberry trees of the Wine', with no sense, but the fact that Morales is located in the Tierra del Vino (Wine Shire) gives the 'surname' of the village and the mulberry trees are not unusual in this territory. Tierra del Vino used to be known for its massive production of wine and the wide vineyards around. Decades ago vine diseases made them to nearly absolutely disappear but nowadays new agricultural techniques and the Quality Brand of the Tierra del Vino Wine have increased the amount of vineyards and the cellars that make the typically red wine from Tempranillo variety. Population and social information Morales population was over 2400 people at the beginning of 2007, but it has quickly increased recently due to its location close to Zamora, the capital of the province, and the good communication of the N-630 Ruta de la Plata road, that crosses the West of Spain, from Asturias to Andalucía. The roadworks that will end up with a new motorway, the A-66, are about to finish. There are many new buildings in Morales del Vino due to the new population living there, and there are many new businesses and services in the village nowadays. Some of the new houses in the town are apartments but most of them are cottages or single houses with their own swimming pool and beautiful gardens. You can find in the town centre some shops and supermarkets, several bank branches, a petrol station, a chemist shop, several bars, press and lottery, fast food and some nice restaurants. The main economic resource of Morales used to be farming, either cattle, sheep, pig or grassland farming. Nowadays, the village is bigger due to the people from Zamora who live in it because of the more tranquil environment, the lower property values, and the commodities available in Morales. There are many people employed now in bars, industry, offices and other services, but even now one finds a beautiful rural landscape around the village. Many areas of Northwest Spain are famous for the food. Morales del Vino is placed within some quality of origin demarcation for food, as the Zamorano Cheese, Zamorano Chorizo and Tierra del Vino Wine. Cheese and wine are the most representative products from these region and Morales holds two high quality cheese factories that can be visited. These factories produce cheese from the local sheep and cow milk. Visitors shouldn't leave Morales without tasting these local products. These products are essential in the daily diet of many , as the pulses and vegetables are too. left History, monuments and visitor attractions The town was founded in the Middle Ages, when the church was built after the Christians recovered the land from the Moors, who stayed here several centuries, but no ruins are left now of their culture. The church has Gothic and Renaissance art style sculpture and building elements; especially noteworthy are the main chapter and the north entrance, with an unusual style for this area. It holds a magnificent baroque organ that scarcely played in religious celebrations that it is worth to listen. There is also a little church on the road to Zamora, called El Cristo, where every May the 9th, the people from Morales, Zamora and other surrounding areas celebrate the Morales del Vino main festivity, El Cristo de Morales, a typical \\"romería\\" where one may taste very good \\"sangría\\", some of the best typical tapas and have a lot of fun in the attractions and in the bars, located in a yard close to the church, where is located the Christ, from the Middle Ages. In this festivity music plays an important role, and because the weather is not usually bad, young and old people celebrate the whole day in the yard drinking 'sangria' and tasting the tapas while the devotees visit the church and attend to the workshops. Morales has many old houses built next to each other, with the main façade on the street and a backyard used typically to grow a little kitchen garden and some hens, pigs or rabbits. A typical old style house might also have several stables to keep the donkeys, mules or horses used in those days to plow the soil or as the only transport means. Nowadays some of these old houses have been restored and they are considered to be luxury mansions. Many of them also have a cave several meters underneath them, where wine was fermented and aged. The old town of Morales is mined with many caves, some of which are beautifully restored as party lounges now. If the visitor get the chance to visit the Town Hall, which was a big house transformed decades ago to the town school (in the 1940s) made on the typical sandstone used in the old style buildings, it would be worth to ask someone in the offices to access to the Town Hall Cave. It is now used only in a few celebrations. thumb There are several ways to reach Morales del Vino; the main way is the road N-630 (Km 285), but there is also a nearby train station in Zamora, with routes to Galicia, Madrid and Valladolid.

Retrieved 9 September 2007. He was partly responsible for the shifting of the original Cincinnati Royals franchise to Kansas City-Omaha, and then on to Sacramento, California.Former Royals, Kings executive Axelson dies at age 80 He died on May 31, 2008 at his home in Coronado, California, aged 80. Axelson was a native of Clinton, Illinois. He played baseball and basketball for school teams. He served in the armed forces in Georgia for several years. Not much is available about Axelson's business activities in the 1960s, but he became involved to some degree with sports event and related promotions in the Cincinnati area. The Jacobs family, then-owners of the NBA's Cincinnati Royals, as well as a slew of other enterprises were looking for someone to be the team's general manager. When Max Jacobs became the Royals' chairman, replacing his deceased father Louis Jacobs in 1968, he named Axelson to the position. However, Axelson had little experience with the sport, let alone the league, making his appointment as general manager quizzical at best. NBA legend Oscar Robertson, who was the Cincinnati Royals' best player, roundly criticized Axelson in his autobiography. \\"Axelson didn't know a basketball from a pumpkin\\" wrote Robertson, a statement made in light of Axelson's poor trading record with the team. Notable trades while general manager Axelson traded Jerry Lucas, a three-time First Team All-NBA player, for two San Francisco Warriors players, Bill Turner and James King. Turner played with the Royals for just one season, then was dealt to the Warriors to join Lucas in 1970. King, who missed games with a broken leg, played just 31 games with the Royals and was then released. Lucas was a starting 1971 NBA West All-Star, then starred for two more seasons for the New York Knickerbockers, helping them reach two NBA Finals. However, Axelson was more notorious for trading Oscar Robertson, who was the franchise's most valuable player. Robertson, at the time the only player in NBA history to average a triple-double for an entire season, had led the Cincinnati Royals throughout the '60s and won the NBA's Most Valuable Player award in 1964. Throughout the 1960s, Robertson had kept the Royals in title contention along with Lucas; however, playing in the Eastern Division along with the Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers meant that the Royals never got the opportunity to play for a title, let alone win one. Robertson's patience with the front office's failure to improve the Royals led him to request a trade. This led Axelson to arrange a trade with the Milwaukee Bucks. In exchange for Robertson, the Cincinnati Royals received Charlie Paulk and Flynn Robinson in return. Paulk had not played at all in 1969–70; he was serving in the military in Georgia that season. He played one year with the Royals, then was traded to Chicago the following season. His entire NBA career was 120 games. Robinson, a very good guard, played just one year with Cincinnati, then was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers by Axelson for a draft pick. Robertson played four more years in the NBA, twice helping the Milwaukee Bucks to the NBA Finals. The Bucks won the title in 1970 against the Baltimore Bullets, setting a then-record for wins with 66, and lost against the Boston Celtics in seven games in 1974. Robertson and Lucas were Axelson's best trade opportunities to help the Cincinnati team. Both trades were roundly criticized. Part-ownership and franchise relocations Axelson was listed as one of the owners when the Cincinnati Royals moved to Kansas City in 1972. In order to forestall confusion with the city's new baseball team, also named the Royals, Axelson renamed the team to the Kings, the name they've kept since. That relocation was poorly planned; the team was supposed to play its home games in Kemper Arena, but it was not initially available for the team's use. That forced the Kings to play \\"home\\" games in both Omaha, Nebraska and Kansas City, Missouri -- cities that are 165 miles apart. Incredibly, despite all that, and a mediocre 36-46 record in their first season in Kansas City, Axelson was named NBA Executive of the Year. Axelson's teams in Kansas City recorded four winning NBA seasons in thirteen years. Amazingly, the Kings reached the NBA Western Conference Finals in 1981, losing to the Houston Rockets in five games. This was the only time in NBA history that two teams with losing records made the conference finals; both the Kings and Rockets had identical 40-42 records. The Rockets went on to become the second team in league history to make the NBA Finals with a losing record, but lost to the Boston Celtics in six games. The Kings' playoff series victories over the Blazers and Suns were their last in Kansas City. Axelson, however, was not part of that success since he took a two year leave to work for the league office as director of operations before resuming his position as general manager of the Kings. The Kansas City Kings' mediocre performance on the court meant they struggled to draw fans, especially when compared to the baseball Royals - who routinely made the postseason, and played in the World Series in 1980. Moreover, they also faced competition in their home arena from the Kansas City Comets indoor soccer team, who moved there from San Francisco in 1981, and made the playoffs the last three years the Kings played in Kansas City. With attendance lagging, and with the Kings now owned by Sacramento- based business interests, Axelson was asked to help relocate the franchise a third time. On the Kings' final home game in Kansas City, played on April 14, 1985, thousands of fans showed their dislike for Axelson by wearing \\"Joe Axelson masks\\" and booing throughout. Axelson was later also burned in effigy. The new Sacramento Kings had a decent first season with a 37-45 record, then failed to win 30 games in any season for the next eight years with Axelson again as general manager.

Its western terminus is at Interstate 44 (I-44) north of Brookline and its eastern terminus is at U.S. Route 65 (US 65) in southeastern Springfield. It is named for the James River, which passes near the highway at the freeway's eastern terminus. A total of four highways (and one business route) are routed on the highway: Route 360, US 60, US 160, Route 13, and Business US 65\\\\. Route description The portion of the James River Freeway between I-44 and the interchange with US 60 and Route 413 is designated as Route 360\\\\. Other than its endpoints, there is only one interchange on the route: Route MM in Brookline (now part of Republic). Exit markers for the highway mark the road as the James River Freeway and have no control cities, only \\"To Route 60\\" eastbound and \\"To I-44\\" westbound. The control cities between US 60 and US 65 are Republic westbound and Rogersville eastbound. At US 65, they are Springfield westbound and Cabool eastbound. History As Springfield began to expand to the south, traffic began to grow rapidly on Route M (known locally as Republic Road) causing significant traffic problems. A proposal for a new highway on the south side (I-44 is on the north, and US 65, also a freeway, is on the east) had been around for some time. By the early 1990s, the road was under construction. It opened in four sections: =Section 1= The first section connected US 160 (Campbell Avenue) with US 65. It took over a slightly reworked Glenstone Avenue which had been around previously and built not-quite to freeway standards. When the original highway had turned, an interchange was built and Glenstone Avenue turned west to become Republic Road. The new south outer road (east of the interchange) now became Glenstone Avenue. Republic Road also crosses over the same interchange and continues east. At this point, Route M was routed down the freeway and Republic Road became a city street. =Section 2= The second section was a relatively short section connecting Kansas Expressway and Campbell Avenue. Shortly after the road was opened, US 60 was rerouted so that it turned south on Kansas Expressway (previously, a city street), then joined the James River Freeway, continuing on east past Glenstone where the road originally joined the freeway. =Section 3= The third section connected US 60 with Kansas Expressway. At the same time it was opened, West Bypass (which previously ended at Sunshine Street to the north, then US 60) was extended south and provided access to west Battlefield Road. US 60 was re-routed down the new stretch of freeway at this time and US 160 was rerouted down West Bypass, joining the freeway for a few miles before turning off again at Campbell Ave. =Section 4= The final section connected Interstate 44 with US 60. Route MM had long served as a bypass on the west side of the city, running through the former town of Brookline but as a two-lane road inadequate for its traffic. The final section served to connect these two roads, also provide traffic relief for US 65 on the east side of the city by providing a direct path from Interstate 44 on the west side of Springfield with US 60, a major east–west road on the south side of the state east of the city (much traffic had had to travel to US 65 and head south to US 60). This section, completed in 2002, was designated as Route 360\\\\. Future =West of Interstate 44= The freeway will not be extended west of I-44 to connect it to the airport. Instead MoDOT and the city of Springfield shared in the upgrade of the I-44 and Chestnut Expressway interchange. A new road was built that connects the new terminal with Route 266 (Chestnut). =Glenstone Avenue interchange= Due to continued development on the city's south side, MODOT and the City of Springfield shared in the reconstruction of the Glenstone Ave. and James River Freeway interchange. Part of the interchange was moved to the south and west of the original interchange. Traffic wanting to enter James River Freeway going east now travels over the bridge and around a loop. Traffic coming from Republic Road wanting to enter JRF going east simply takes the existing on-ramp. Traffic wanting to exit from eastbound JRF to get to North Glenstone or W. Republic Road will take the new exit to get to the new part of the interchange. Traffic from westbound JRF exiting to N. Glenstone or W. Republic Rd. will use the existing exit ramp and traffic entering westbound JRF from Glenstone or Republic will use the existing on-ramp. The stoplight for this part of the interchange will remain. The project was completed in December 2008.\\"Major Projects MoDOT\\" By October of 2021, There will be a roundabout on the south side of the interchange. Roads entering/exiting the roundabout include Republic Rd/Glenstone Ave, Nature Center Way (JRF outer road), and the ramp to US 60 East. There are currently two ramps to eastbound US 60, one supporting traffic from E. Republic Road and the other from S. Glenstone Ave. The ramp supporting E. Republic Road will be demolished, and the other ramp will be restructured and widened to support left-turning traffic from E. Republic Road and connect to the new roundabout. US 60 will be receiving a new through travel lane in each direction with this project.https://www.modot.org/sites/default/files/documents/J8P3032B_Section%202_Glenstone%20Interchange_reduced_0.pdf =US 60 & US 65= The current cloverleaf interchange has been the source of many accidents due to the growth of the cities of Ozark, Nixa, and Branson to the south. Also, the railroad crossing, which crosses not only the freeway itself, but the ramp from east 60 to south 65, has also resulted in numerous accidents from vehicles stopping because of a train passing or because they are required to (buses or trucks carrying hazardous materials). The current highway, James River Freeway, curves and then travels down a steep grade to the interchange with US 65 then crosses James River before going up a steep grade and curve before heading east towards Rogersville, MO. Completed in October 2012, a large project replaced the two eastern loops with flyover ramps. The northbound US 65 bridge over US 60, as well as the westbound US 60 bridge over James River were replaced. The railroad grade crossing was removed by building four bridges over Galloway Creek and the BNSF track. =East of US 65= MoDOT discussed the possibility of upgrading US 60 east of the US 65 freeway, to as far east as Rogersville, at a public meeting on November 29, 2007. So far interchanges have been constructed in Rogersville as well as at the J/NN intersection. An interchange at Route 125 will be completed by 2023. =National Avenue area= A construction project was completed in July 2010 to improve traffic flow near the Cox Health buildings in southern Springfield by converting the interchange into a six-lane diverging diamond interchange (DDI). It was the second DDI to appear in Springfield (the first being the Interstate 44/Kansas Expressway interchange). Just north of this interchange, a safer underpass was created for E. Bradford Parkway to remove the at-grade intersection with National Avenue. Both of these projects were funded through a partnership between MODOT, the City of Springfield, and Cox Health Systems.

Ink on paper drawing of a 30 cm high etching on Porites coral stone from the 9th century kept at the museum in Malè. It represents Green Tara, a Vajrayana Buddhist female deity representing enlightened activity and fearlessness. Buddhism was the predominant religion in the Maldives until at least the 12th century CE. It is not clear how and when Buddhism was introduced into the islands. Archaeology Western interest in the archaeological remains of early cultures on the Maldives began with the work of H. C. P. Bell, a British commissioner of the Ceylon Civil Service. Bell was shipwrecked on the islands in 1879, and returned several times to investigate ancient Buddhist ruins. He studied the ancient mounds, called havitta or ustubu (these names are derived from chaitiya or stupa) () by the Maldivians, which are found on many of the atolls.HCP Bell, The Máldive Islands: An account of the Physical Features, History, Inhabitants, Productions and Trade. Colombo 1883 Although Bell claimed that the ancient Maldivians followed Theravada Buddhism in the same manner as the Sinhalese people from neighboring Sri Lanka, Maldivian Buddhist archaeological remains that were preserved in the Malé Museum display in fact Mahayana and Vajrayana iconography.Xavier Romero-Frias, The Maldive Islanders, A Study of the Popular Culture of an Ancient Ocean Kingdom. According to a legend of the Maldivian Folklore, a prince named Koimala from India or Sri Lanka entered the Maldives from the North (Ihavandhu) and became the first king from the House of Theemuge. Prior to that the Maldives had been settled by people of Dravidian origin from the nearest coasts, like the group today known as the Giravaaru who claim ancestry from ancient Tamils. It is unlikely that the Giraavaru islanders were the only early settlers in the Maldives. The importance they have been given is because they are mentioned in the legend about the establishment of the capital and kingly rule in Malé. The Giraavaru people were just one of the island communities predating Buddhism and the arrival of a Northern Kingly dynasty and the establishment of centralized political and administrative institutions. The ancient Maldivian Kings promoted Buddhism and the first Maldive writings and artistic achievements in the form of highly developed sculpture and architecture are from that period. The conversion to Islam is mentioned in the ancient edicts written in copper plates from the end of the 12th century AD. There is also a locally well-known legend about a foreign saint (Persian or Moroccan according to the versions) who subdued a demon known as Rannamaari. Over the centuries, the islands have been visited and their development influenced by sailors and traders from countries on the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. Until relatively recent times, Mappila pirates from the Malabar Coast harassed the islands. Destruction of Buddhist sculptures in 2012 In February 2012, a group of Islamic extremists forced their way into the National Museum in Malé and attacked the museum's collection of pre-Islamic sculptures, destroying or severely damaging nearly the entire collection about thirty Buddhist sculptures dating from the 6th to 12th centuries. Museum staff indicated that as the sculptures were made from very brittle coral or limestone it would be impossible to repair most of them, and only two or three pieces were in a repairable condition.

On February 22, 2016, GamesCampus announced that the Drift City USA servers would close. On March 21, 2016, the game was shut down, although the Korean & Japanese versions are still playable. Gameplay A screenshot of several players at Cras City in Drift City. Drift City is a cel-shaded racing video game which includes single-player (missions) and multi-player modes (team car racing, PVP) to play. The currency earned (named Mito) while playing can be spent on customizing owned cars, collecting new parts or buying some new rides. A large majority of missions involves reaching targets, occasionally with a time or crash limit, while following the arrow, similar to Crazy Taxi. Successfully completing a mission or a race gives a certain amount of experience points and Mito. As an arcade-style racer, the physics make game feel faster and less prone to hazards. There are 9 different types of cars, sorted by their power and overall quality. Before some of these can be unlocked, it is necessary to meet level requirements. At a certain point of time, the players will be informed of the location of a fugitive HUV that is near. If that request is accepted, the car chase starts with a time limit where the goal is to hit the runaway car until durability reaches zero. At any time, the player can slide/drift the car that is controlled, which allows taking corners as quickly as possible. The game will reward risks while driving by filling up the boost meter, which can be used for super speed. Combos are performed when players drive dangerously, such as doing so while in a traffic, opposite lane, or drifting. What lies beneath the community aspect of Drift City are Crews that can be joined, where the players can chat, participate in single or team duels, or share missions with other people around. There is a central hub which includes things like the Battle Zone and various shops.

The EPA encourages the City Council's to produce shoreline management plans for coastlines and tidal waterways within the local authority area. The Council commenced work on the GCSMP in 2005.Gold Coast Shoreline Management Plan The previous key planning document for Gold Coast beaches was the Delft Report of 1971. Delft Report Gold Coast Beaches have had periods of severe beach erosion. In 1967, a series of eleven cyclones removed most of the sand from Gold Coast beaches. The Government of Queensland engaged engineers from Delft University in the Netherlands to advise what to do about the beach erosion. The Delft Report was published in 1971, and outlined a series of works for Gold Coast Beaches including Gold Coast Seaway, works at Narrowneck that resulted in the Northern Gold Coast Beach Protection Strategy and works at the Tweed River that became the Tweed River Entrance Sand Bypassing Project.Northern Gold Coast Beach Protection Strategy Gold Coast Seaway Delft Report Tweed River Entrance Sand Bypassign Project  Gold Coast Seawall  The Gold Coast seawall in Australia is contained within the Gold Coast's shoreline management plan. The original seawall was laid out following 11 cyclones in 1967 with assistance from coastal engineers from Delft University. The seawall alignment was selected to pick up as many of the older seawalls as possible. The seawall consists of three layers, armour boulders up to 4 tonnes, secondary armour around 360 kg and a clay shale foundation layer. The seawall is 16m across and 6m high and has a front slope of 1:1.5. The seawall was tested in a wave tank to withstand attack from a 1:100 cyclone wave. A Gold Coast Seawall costs around A$3000 per meter to construct in 2006. The seawall is constructed along a designated seawall alignment along urban sections of the Gold Coast coastline. Non-Urban sections of coastline including South Stradbroke Island and the Southport Spit are not licensed for the construction of a seawall. The Gold Coast Planning Scheme requires private property owners along the beach to construct the seawall at their property at the property owners expense prior to making any investment into their house. The Council constructs sections of seawall that protect public land. Sand Backpassing from the Gold Coast Seaway to Surfers Paradise The Delft report recommended the stabilisation of the Gold Coast Seaway and the construction of a sand bypass system to pump sand from the mainland under the navigation channel to South Stradbroke Island. The GCSMP will examine whether 20% of the sand could instead be backpassed sustainably to the beaches of Surfers Paradise to mitigate the impact of climate change. Prior to stabilisation of the Gold Coast Seaway the island welding hypothesis suggests that up to 20% of all sand moving along the Gold Coast (Longshore drift) entered the Gold Coast Broadwater to gradually weld islands onto the mainland. Narrowneck Reef In 1971 the Dutch University Delft completed a report for the Queensland State Government recommending the construction of a groyne at Narrowneck. The Council examined the idea of a groyne and instead constructed an artificial reef to stabilise the foreshore at Narrowneck. So far the reef has worked well as a coastal control point, but has been disappointing in its secondary objective to improve surfing. A surprising benefit of the Narrowneck Reef has been its ability to attract marine growth and reef fish and is now a popular diving and fishing location. Narrowneck is particularly popular for kite surfing and longboarding. Kurrawa Park Reef The Narrowneck Reef was constructed as a coastal control point 1/3 of the way between Burleigh Heads and the Gold Coast Seaway. The GCSMP will examine if a new reef at Kurrawa Park should be constructed at the 2/3s position to assist with the adaption of Gold Coast beaches to climate change. Palm Beach Protection Strategy In 2004 Gold Coast City Council proposed a new beach protection scheme for Palm Beach which included a new reef for 21st Avenue Palm Beach. The proposed scheme included 3 reefs and beach nourishment. Some in the community didn't like the idea and organised a \\"no reef\\" protest campaign that prevented the scheme being implemented. Currumbin Alley Council dredges Currumbin Creek each year. Southern Points The Southern Points of the Gold Coast are northern facing and provide spectacular coastal vistas and great surf. =Kirra Point= A popular surfing site, surfers are concerned that sand is drowning quality surf, but there is debate about the objectivity of perception of impacts. Council is undertaking nourishment of the foreshore to bury the seawall to increase the amount of recreational parkland. =Greenmount Point= Surfing waves break along a sand bank that extends from Snapper Rocks through Rainbow Bay, past Greenmount point and Coolangatta, then to Kirra. This region has been called the Superbank. =Snapper Rocks= Surfers lobbied to have the sand outlet moved to improve the Surf at Snapper Rocks Tweed River Entrance Sandbypassing A sand bypassing system commenced operating to deliver sand across the Tweed River from New South Wales to Queensland in 2001. Gold Coast Oceanway The Gold Coast Oceanway is a network of pathways along Gold Coast beaches that encourages healthier and more sustainable coastal lifestyles.

Both the island and the mainland shore have seen relatively little development since the area was of military importance in 1776. In 1776, Benedict Arnold was placed in command of a Continental Navy fleet on the lake, composed mostly of small gundalows armed with three small cannons. After training with the fleet during the summer months, Arnold selected Valcour Bay as the place to meet the British Royal Navy fleet, which had taken longer to prepare for action. The bay's location required the British fleet to sail with the wind south past the island, and then turn to come upwind toward Arnold's fleet, which he arrayed in a crescent formation. Meeting in battle on October 11, the two fleets engaged in battle in which both sides suffered some damage, but left the American fleet in a precarious position, with little ammunition and separated from its base by the British presence. The Americans were able to escape that night, but most of their fleet was abandoned, sunk, or captured over the next two days. The , which was sunk during the battle, was raised in 1935 and is on display at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. It was also declared a National Historic Landmark in 1961.
