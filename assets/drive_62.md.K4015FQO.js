Cherimoya was bred and owned by South African mining magnate William Broderick Cloete, who was killed in 1915 during the sinking of . Her most notable offspring were the fillies Sunny Moya and Una Cameron. Cherimoya was euthanised in 1927. Background Cherimoya was bred by W. Broderick Cloete and was foaled on 4 May 1908 at his Hare Park estate near London. Cloete was a South African mining entrepreneur who had campaigned the 1885 2000 Guineas winner Paradox. Cherimoya's sire, Cherry Tree, was bred by Cloete and was sold as a yearling in 1892 to American turfman Marcus Daly for 4,000 guineas; Daly relocated him to his Bitterroot Stud in the Bitterroot Valley of Montana. He was named Matt Byrnes (after a noted horse trainer) in the United States and raced with some success. Cloete repurchased the horse from Daly for $25,000 in October 1897 and renamed him Cherry Tree. Cherimoya's dam, Svelte, was also bred by Cloete and was not a successful racehorse. She was exclusively bred to Cherry Tree whilst owned by Cloete, producing five full-siblings to Cherimoya. Cherimoya was a described by The Sydney Morning Herald as a \\"fine, substantial, big boned filly.\\" Racing career Racing for Broderick Cloete, Cherimoya won The Oaks in the only official start of her racing career. Cloete's racing colours were a crimson shirt with black and white sleeves and a black cap. Cherimoya was trained by Charles Marsh at Newmarket and was a promising racehorse in her two-year-old trials. A few days before her anticipated first start at Sandown in the National Breeders' Produce Stakes, Cherimoya cut one of her fetlock joints after an exercise session when she was startled by a bird and fell over \\"a heap of stones\\" used for mending a nearby road. The injury prevented Cherimoya from competing the rest of the season and she was sidelined until her start in the Oaks. =1911 Epsom Oaks= Cherimoya winning the 1911 Epsom Oaks in the first and only start of her racing career in a photograph taken by C.J. Waters. Second place finisher Tootles follows closely (second from left) in the background. On 2 June, Cherimoya started in the Oaks Stakes in a field of 21 horses. Cherimoya held a good position from the start of the race, taking the lead a quarter of a mile from the finish and winning easily by three lengths over the betting favourite Tootles. Cherimoya was an unanticipated winner, factoring at 20 to 1 odds in the betting pools, and her win reportedly left \\"the spectators too dumbfounded to cheer.\\" She was ridden by a 16-year-old apprentice jockey named Fred Winter, later a successful horse trainer and the father of champion jockey and trainer Fred Winter. Cherimoya was entered in the St. James Stakes at Kempton Park held in August, but did not run in the race. The Times speculated that her absence was \\"in consequence of the hard ground\\" at the racecourse. The filly was withdrawn from further racing engagements in October 1911 due to trouble from \\"contracted feet.\\" Cherimoya returned to training as a four-year-old, but injury again prevented her from running in the Coronation Stakes and Cesarewich Stakes. Cherimoya never raced again and was retired to Cloete's stud at Hare Park in 1913. Stud career Cherimoya was retired in 1913 to Broderick Cloete's stud at Hare Park. Cloete was killed on 7 May 1915 while en route from Mexico to England during the attack and sinking of . After the death of Cloete, Cherimoya was sold for $11,500 in 1915 to Sir Thomas Dewar. The proprietors of the Wickliffe Stud, American turfmen James C. Corrigan and Price McKinney, were interested in purchasing Cherimoya but their bid via cablegram for the mare was delayed. By 1918, Cherimoya had been relocated to J.B. Joel's Childwickbury Stud in St. Albans, Hertfordshire. Cherimoya was euthanised in October 1927. Cherimoya's most notable offspring were the fillies Sunny Moya (foaled in 1917 by Sunstar) and Una Cameron (foaled in 1922 by Gainsborough). Sunny Moya was a dam of the colts The Mac Nab and Sunny Trace. Una Cameron was the dam of the Epsom Derby winner Cameronian.

It serves as the global headquarters of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries, also known as the Lusophone Commonwealth.  History  The front facade of the Palace of the High Courier The enclosure/courtyard of the palace showing the spine of the \\"L-shaped\\" building The palace was built in the first half of the 17th century over the remains of the Palace of the High Courier, the courtly officer responsible for communications within the kingdom. Between 1606 and 1755 it was the residence of the High-Couriers, becoming the seat of the postal authority for the Kingdom. But, the palace was only concluded in 1776, after remodelling associated with its reconstruction, following the devastating 1755 Lisbon earthquake. When the office of High Courier was abolished in 1797, is resident made the Count of Penafiel in compensation, thereby resulting in its new designation. In 1859, the kingdom's last official High-Courier to the Kingdom, Manuel Jos√© da Maternidade da Mata de Sousa Coutinho, 1st Count of Penafiel (n.1782) died in the residence. The palace passed into the hands of his only daughter, the 2nd Countess and 1st Marquess of Penafiel, D. Maria da Assun√ß√£o da Mata de Sousa Coutinho (1827-1892). There was a campaign around 1865 to remodel the palace, that included redecoration, the alteration of the principal access and the arrange of the frontispiece under the direction of Ant√≥nio Tom√°s da Fonseca. Following the death of the marquessa in 1891, the palace began to be partially rented. Between 1894 and 1904, the Viscountess of Almeida and her four daughters resided at the palace, using an access along the Rua das Pedras Negras, 16. Two years later (and until 1910), from the a doorway along Rua de S√£o Mamede, 63, Engineer Manuel Afonso Espregueira, the de facto Finance Minister () under King D. Portugal and D. Manuel II. But, by the end of 1904, a great part of the palace was occupied by the residence of the Ambassador of Spain. The palace required significant repairs in 1914, and was in the course of being purchased by the Caminhos de Ferro do Estado (State Railway), and eventually concluded in 1919. By 1941, the Dire√ß√£o-Geral dos Caminhos de Ferro (Directorate-General of the State Railway) was operating from the site, but was eventually replaced by the Conselho Superior de Obras P√∫blicas (Superior Council of Public Works), forerunner of the Minist√©rio das Obras Publicas, Transportes e Comunica√ß√µes. The Comiss√£o para a Aquisi√ß√£o de Mobili√°rio (Commission for Furniture Acquisition), along with the architects Eduardo Moreira Santos and Lu√≠s Benavente, began to deal with providing furniture for Public Works, complimenting the work and expansion at that the Dire√ß√£o Regional dos Edif√≠cios de Lisboa (Lisbon Regional Directorate for Buildings). The furnishing for the Gabinete do Presidente was studied by Lu√≠s Benavente. In this first phase, the furniture was acquired from the factories As√©ta (in Porto) and Madeiras & M√≥veis (from Praia da Granja). Between 1951 and 1952, the second phase of the project was furnished by factories Alberto de Sousa Reis (in Espinho) and Olaio (in Lisbon). In 2011 the palace was offered to the Community of Portuguese Language Countries to serve as its global headquarters in Portugal. Architecture The palace is situated in an urban location, occupying the entire block marked by a very sharp drop. The L-shaped building is divided into two volumes, a northern and eastern wings, topped in roofing tile. The principal elevation, in the north, is characterized by a succession of wall, doors with access to the patio and top of the northern wing, delimited laterally by granite cornerstones. Above are two floors divided by cornice and separated by friezes, animated by the decorated windows on the ground floor and others with rounded windows and iron grade along the second floor. Between the doors and over a portion of the graded wall, there are two angels supported by pillars and the coat-or-arms of the Counts of Penafiel, surmounted by crown. The rectangular patio, defined by the limits of the residence and small informal garden (in the northeast). The wainscotting is visible for the monochromatic azulejo tiles, that predate the northern part of the eastern wing, whose ground floor is marked by three arches with the access to the interior. The southern elevation, from the ground floor is decorated in cornerstone and has four floors, and includes three corps, including central plan, decorated in rock-like veneer coating until the last floor. There are 12 vains per floor with windows and doors, with the principal spaces occupying the first floor of the north wing.

Samsung Electronic Co., Ltd. was the first of a series of ongoing lawsuits between Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics regarding the design of smartphones and tablet computers; between them, the companies made more than half of smartphones sold worldwide as of July 2012. In the spring of 2011, Apple began litigating against Samsung in patent infringement suits, while Apple and Motorola Mobility were already engaged in a patent war on several fronts. Apple's multinational litigation over technology patents became known as part of the mobile device \\"smartphone patent wars\\": extensive litigation in fierce competition in the global market for consumer mobile communications. By August 2011, Apple and Samsung were litigating 19 ongoing cases in nine countries; by October, the legal disputes expanded to ten countries. By July 2012, the two companies were still embroiled in more than 50 lawsuits around the globe, with billions of dollars in damages claimed between them. While Apple won a ruling in its favor in the U.S., Samsung won rulings in South Korea, Japan, and the UK. On June 4, 2013, Samsung won a limited ban from the U.S. International Trade Commission on sales of certain Apple products after the commission found Apple had violated a Samsung patent, but this was vetoed by U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman. On December 6, 2016, the United States Supreme Court decided 8-0 to reverse the decision from the first trial that awarded nearly $400 million to Apple and returned the case to Federal Circuit court to define the appropriate legal standard \\"article of manufacture\\" because it is not the smartphone itself but could be just the case and screen to which the design patents relate. Origin iPhone GUI images filed by Apple on June 23, 2007 in color design patent US$604305. On January 4, 2007, 4 days before the iPhone was introduced to the world, Apple filed a suite of 4 design patents covering the basic shape of the iPhone. These were followed up in June of that year with a massive filing of a color design patent covering 193 screenshots of various iPhone graphical user interfaces. It is from these filings along with Apple's utility patents, registered trademarks and trade dress rights, that Apple selected the particular intellectual property to enforce against Samsung.Nowotarski, Mark, \\" The Power of Portfolio: Strong Design Patents III \\", IP Watchdog, 23 August 2013 Apple sued its component supplier Samsung, alleging in a 38-page federal complaint on April 15, 2011 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California that several of Samsung's Android phones and tablets, including the Nexus S, Epic 4G, Galaxy S 4G, and the Samsung Galaxy Tab, infringed on Apple's intellectual property: its patents, trademarks, user interface and style. Apple's complaint included specific federal claims for patent infringement, false designation of origin, unfair competition, and trademark infringement, as well as state-level claims for unfair competition, common law trademark infringement, and unjust enrichment. Apple's evidence submitted to the court included side-by-side image comparisons of iPhone 3GS and i9000 Galaxy S to illustrate the alleged similarities in packaging and icons for apps. However, the images were later found to have been tampered with in order to make the dimensions and features of the two different products seem more similar, and counsel for Samsung accused Apple of submitting misleading evidence to the court.See also:   Samsung counter-sued Apple on April 22, 2011, filing federal complaints in courts in Seoul, South Korea; Tokyo, Japan; and Mannheim, Germany, alleging Apple infringed Samsung's patents for mobile-communications technologies. By summer, Samsung also filed suits against Apple in the British High Court of Justice, in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, and with the United States International Trade Commission (ITC) in Washington D.C., all in June 2011. South Korean courts In Seoul, Samsung filed its lawsuit in April 2011 in the Central District Court citing five patent infringements. In late August 2012, a three-judge panel in Seoul Central District Court delivered a split decision, ruling that Apple had infringed upon two Samsung technology patents, while Samsung violated one of Apple's patents. The court awarded small damages to both companies and ordered a temporary sales halt of the infringing products in South Korea; however, none of the banned products were the latest models of either Samsung or Apple. The court ruled that Samsung violated one of Apple's utility patents, over the so-called \\"bounce- back\\" effect in iOS, and that Apple was in violation of two of Samsung's wireless patents. Apple's claims that Samsung copied the designs of the iPhone and iPad were deemed invalid. The court also ruled that there was \\"no possibility\\" that consumers would confuse the smartphones of the two brands, and that Samsung's smartphone icons did not infringe upon Apple's patents. Japanese courts Samsung's complaint in Japan's Tokyo District Court cited two infringements. Apple has filed other patent suits in Japan against Samsung, most notably one for the \\"bounce-back\\" feature. Samsung has also sued Apple, claiming the iPhone and iPad infringe on Samsung patents. On August 31, 2012, The Tokyo District Court ruled that Samsung's Galaxy smartphones and tablets did not violate an Apple patent on technology that synchronizes music and videos between devices and servers.Tabuchi, Hiroko, and Wingfield, Nick, Tokyo Court Hands Win to Samsung Over Apple, The New York Times, nytimes.com, August 31, 2012.

Presiding Judge Tamotsu Shoji said: \\"The defendant's products do not seem like they used the same technology as the plaintiff's products so we turn down the complaints made by [Apple].\\" German courts In August 2011, the Landgericht court in D√ºsseldorf, Germany granted Apple's request for an EU-wide preliminary injunction barring Samsung from selling its Galaxy Tab 10.1 device on the grounds Samsung's product infringed on two of Apple's interface patents. After Samsung's allegations of evidence tampering were heard, the court rescinded the EU-wide injunction and granted Apple a lesser injunction that only applied to the German market. Samsung also pulled the Galaxy Tab 7.7 from Berlin's IFA electronics fair due to the ruling preventing marketing of the device, before the court was set to make its ruling in September 2011.Samsung pulls tablet computer from German fair, AP Worldstream, AP, 2011.

Presiding judge Johanna Brueckner- Hofmann said there was a \\"clear impression of similarity\\". Samsung would appeal the decision. In March 2012, the Mannheim state court judges dismissed both the Apple and Samsung cases involving ownership of the \\"slide-to-unlock\\" feature used on their respective smartphones. The New York Times reported the German courts were at the center of patent fights among technology company rivals. In July 2012, the Munich Higher Regional Court Oberlandesgericht M√ºnchen affirmed the lower Regional Court's denial of Apple's motion for a preliminary injunction on Apple's allegation that Samsung infringed Apple's \\"overscroll bounce\\" patent; the appellate court's appealable ruling affirmed the lower court's February decision doubting the validity of Apple's patent. On September 21, Mannheim Regional Court ruled in favour of Samsung in that it did not violate Apple's patented features in regards to touch-screen technology. French and Italian courts Shortly after the release of the iPhone 4S, Samsung filed motions for injunctions in courts in Paris and Milan to block further Apple iPhone sales in France and Italy, claiming the iPhone infringed on two separate patents of the Wideband Code Division Multiple Access standard. Samsung reportedly singled out the French and Italian markets as key electronic communications markets in Europe, and by filing suit in a different court, avoided going back to the German court where it had lost a round earlier in its battle with Apple. Dutch courts Apple initially sued Samsung on grounds of patent infringement, specifically European patents 2.059.868, 2.098.948, and 1.964.022. On the 24th of October, 2011, a court in the Hague ruled only a photo gallery app in Android 2.3 was indeed infringing a patent (EP 2.059.868), resulting in an import ban of three Samsung telephones (the Galaxy S, Galaxy S II, and Ace) running the infringing software. Phones operating more recent versions of Android remained unaffected. This made the import and sale of the banned phone models with updated software still legal. This ruling was widely interpreted as a favourable one for Samsung, and an appeal by Apple may still be forthcoming. On September 26, 2011, Samsung counter-sued and asked the court for an injunction on sale Apple's iPad and iPhones, on the grounds that Apple does not have the licenses to use 3G mobile technology.Corder, Mike, Samsung seeks iPhone, iPad sale ban in Dutch court, AP Worldstream, AP, 2011. Retrieved August 29, 2012.

Retrieved August 29, 2012. The court found that Samsung's fee was unreasonable, but noted that, if the companies cannot make a fair and reasonable licensing fee, Samsung could open a new case against Apple. In late October 2011, the civil court in The Hague ruled for Apple in rejecting Samsung's infringement arguments and denied Samsung's motion made there; Samsung appealed the decision and in January 2012, the Dutch appeals court overruled the civil court decision, rejecting Apple's claim that Samsung's Galaxy Tab 10.1 infringed its design rights. Australian courts Also in early 2011, an Australian federal court granted Apple's request for an injunction against Samsung's Galaxy Tab 10.1. Samsung agreed to an expedited appeal of the Australian decision in the hope that if it won its appeal before Christmas, it might salvage holiday sales that it would otherwise lose. Ultimately, the injunction Apple sought to block the Tab 10.1 was denied by the High Court of Australia. In July 2012 an Australian judge started hearing the companies' evidence for a trial anticipated to take three months. British courts Samsung applied to the High Court of Justice, Chancery Division, in Samsung Electronics (UK) Limited & Anr v. Apple Inc., for a declaration that its Galaxy tablets were not too similar to Apple's products. Apple counterclaimed, but Samsung prevailed after a British judge ruled Samsung's Galaxy tablets were not similar enough to be confused with Apple's iPad. In July 2012, Birss J denied Samsung's motion for an injunction blocking Apple from publicly stating that the Galaxy infringed Apple's design rights, but ordered Apple to publish a disclaimer on Apple's own website and in the media that Samsung did not copy the iPad. The judge stayed the publishing order, however, until Apple's appeal was heard in October 2012. When the case reached the court of appeal, the previous ruling was supported, meaning that Apple is required to publish a disclaimer on Apple's own website and in the media that Samsung did not copy the iPad. U.S. courts =First U.S. trial= In two separate lawsuits, Apple accused Samsung of infringing on three utility patents (United States Patent Nos. 7,469,381, 7,844,915, and 7,864,163) and four design patents (United States Patent Nos. D504,889, D593,087, D618,677, and D604,305). Samsung accused Apple of infringing on United States Patent Nos. 7,675,941, 7,447,516, 7,698,711, 7,577,460, and 7,456,893. One 2005 design patent \\"at the heart of the dispute is Design Patent 504,889\\", which consists of a one-sentence claim about the ornamental design of an electronic device, accompanied by nine figures depicting a thin rectangular cuboid with rounded corners.. A U.S. jury trial was scheduled for July 30, 2012 and calendared by the court through September 7, 2012. Both Phil Schiller and Scott Forstall testified on the Apple v. Samsung trial. First trial verdict On August 24, 2012 the jury returned a verdict largely favorable to Apple. It found that Samsung had willfully infringed on Apple's design and utility patents and had also diluted Apple's trade dresses related to the iPhone. The jury awarded Apple $1.049 billion in damages and Samsung zero damages in its counter suit. The jury found Samsung infringed Apple's patents on iPhone's \\"Bounce-Back Effect\\" (US Patent No. 7,469,381), \\"On-screen Navigation\\" (US Patent No. 7,844,915), and \\"Tap To Zoom\\" (US Patent No. 7,864,163), and design patents that covers iPhone's features such as the \\"home button, rounded corners and tapered edges\\" (US D593087) and \\"On-Screen Icons\\" (US D604305).Burnett, Ed, The verdict is in: Samsung vs. Apple, zdnet.com, August 25, 2012.

This amount is functionally reduced by the bond posted by Apple for the injunction granted during the trial (see below). On October 23, 2012, U.S. Patent and Trademark Office tentatively invalidated Apple's bounce back patent (US Patent No. '381) possibly affecting the ruling in the Apple v.

Apple's attorneys filed a request to stop all sales of the Samsung products cited in violation of the US patents, a motion denied by Judge Lucy H. Koh on December 17, 2012,Apple Denied Motion for Permanent Injunction who also decided that the jury had miscalculated US$400 million in its initial damage assessment and ordered a retrial. Injunction of U.S. sales during first trial The injunction Apple sought in the U.S. to block Samsung smartphones such as the Infuse 4G and the Droid Charge was denied. Judge Koh ruled that Apple's claims of irreparable harm had little merit because although Apple established a likelihood of success at trial on the merits of its claim that Samsung infringed one of its tablet patents, Apple had not shown that it could overcome Samsung's challenges to the patent's validity. Apple appealed Judge Koh's ruling, and on May 14, 2012, the appeals court reversed and ordered Judge Koh to issue the injunction. The preliminary injunction was granted in June 2012, preventing Samsung from making, using, offering to sell, selling, or importing into the U.S. the Galaxy Nexus and any other of its technology making use of the disputed patent. Simultaneously, Apple was ordered to post a US$95.6 million bond in the event that Samsung prevailed at trial. Following the trial, in which the Nexus was found not to infringe Apple's patents, Samsung filed an appeal to remove the preliminary injunction.Samsung to appeal US Galaxy Tab 10.1 injunction after tablet ruled innocent [Update: Request filed], thenextweb.com, August 27, 2012.

Retrieved August 30, 2012. where, at the 3 minute mark in the video, the jury foreman Hogan said: \\"the software on the Apple side could not be placed into the processor on the prior art and vice versa, and that means they are not interchangeable,\\" and at the 2:42-2:45 minute mark, in which Hogan states \\"each patent had a different legal premise.\\" Groklaw reported that this interview indicates the jury may have awarded inconsistent damages and ignored the instructions given to them. In an article on Gigaom, Jeff John Roberts contended that the case suggests that juries should not be allowed to rule on patent cases at all.Roberts, Jeff John, 3 reasons juries have no place in the patent system, gigaom.com, August 27, 2012. Retrieved August 30, 2012 Scott McKeown, however, suggested that Hogan's comment may have been poorly phrased. Some have claimed that there are a few oddities with Samsung's U.S. Patent discussed by Hogan during the interview, specifically that the '460 patent has only one claim.. Most US patents have between 10 - 20 separate claims,Radack, David, Reading and Understanding Patent Claims, JOM, 47:11 (1995), p. 69. Retrieved September 1, 2012. most of which are dependent claims. This patent was filed as a division of an earlier application, possibly in anticipation of litigation, which may explain the reduced number of claims. The specifics of this patent have not been discussed in the Groklaw review or the McKeown review because most believe that the foreman misspoke when he mentioned the number of the patent in question; a more detailed interview with the BBC made it clear that the patent(s) relevant to the prior art controversy were owned by Apple, not Samsung, meaning that his mention of the \\"460 patent\\" was a mistake. On Friday, September 21, 2012, Samsung requested a new trial from the judge in San Jose arguing that the verdict was not supported by evidence or testimony, that the judge imposed limits on testimony time and the number of witnesses prevented Samsung from receiving a fair trial, and that the jury verdict was unreasonable. Apple filed papers on September 21 and 22, 2012 seeking a further amount of interest and damages totaling $707 million. A hearing has been scheduled in U.S. District Court on December 6, 2012 to discuss these and other issues. On October 2, 2012, Samsung appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, requesting that Apple's victory be thrown out, claiming that the foreman of the jury had not disclosed that he had been sued by Seagate Technology Inc., his former employer, and which has a strategic relationship with Samsung, despite having been asked during jury selection if he had been involved in lawsuits. Samsung also claimed that the foreman had not revealed a past personal bankruptcy. The foreman responded that he had been asked during jury selection whether he had been involved in any lawsuits during the past 10 years, so that the events claimed by Samsung occurred before that time frame, although his claim is not consistent with the actual question he was asked by the Judge. Apple has similarly appealed the decision vacating the injunction on Samsung's sales. Leading up to a December 4, 2014 hearing at the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, Samsung had noted that the USPTO had released preliminary and/or final findings of invalidity against some of the patents relevant to the first case, namely the so-called pinch-to- zoom patent 7,844,915., fosspatents.com, December 5, 2014. Retrieved January 28, 2015. Samsung argued for, at the very least, a recalculation of the damages they owe in the case. On May 18, 2015, the Federal Circuit affirmed parts of the jury verdict, but vacated the jury's damages awards against the Samsung products that were found liable for trade dress dilution. First trial controversy The ruling in the landmark patent case raised controversies over the impact on the consumers and the smartphone industry. The jury's decision was described as being 'Apple-friendly' by Wired and a possible reason for the increased costs‚Äîbecause of licensing fees to Apple‚Äîthat subsequently affected Android smartphone users. A question was also raised about the validity of lay juries in the U.S. patent system, whereby the qualifications of the jury members were deemed inadequate for a complex patent case; however, it was later revealed that the jury foreman Velvin Hogan was an electrical engineer and a patent holder himself. Hogan's post-verdict interviews with numerous media outlets raised a great deal of controversy over his role as the jury foreman. He told Bloomberg TV that his experience with patents had helped to guide the jurors' decisions in the trial. A juror Manuel Ilagan said in an interview with CNET a day after the verdict that \\"Hogan was jury foreman. He had experience. He owned patents himself ‚Ä¶ so he took us through his experience. After that it was easier.\\" As the jury instructions stated that jurors can make decisions based solely on the law as instructed and \\"not based on your understanding of the law based on your own cases,\\" controversy was consequently generated. Hogan also told the Reuters news agency that the jury wanted to make sure the message it sent was not just a \\"slap on the wrist\\" and wanted to make sure it was sufficiently high to be painful, but not unreasonable. His remark does not corroborate with jury instructions that state: \\"the damages award should put the patent holder in approximately the financial position it would have been in had the infringement not occurred\\" and \\"it is meant to compensate the patent holder and not to punish an infringer.\\" Samsung appealed against the decision, claiming jury misconduct, and Samsung can be given a new trial if the appeal court finds that there was juror misconduct. Other questions were raised about the jury's quick decision. The jury was given more than 700 questions, including highly technical matters, to reach the verdict and awarded Apple more than US$1 billion in damages after less than three days of deliberations. Critics claimed that the nine jurors did not have sufficient time to read the jury instructions. A juror stated in an interview with CNET that the jury decided after the first day of deliberations that Samsung was in the wrong. First Retrial of damages amount from first U.S. trial In a damage-only retrial court session on November 13, 2013, ordered in relation to the first U.S. trial by Judge Koh in December 2012, Samsung Electronics stated in a San Jose, U.S. courtroom that Apple's hometown jury found Samsung copied some elements of Apple's design. Samsung's attorney clarified the purpose of the damage-only retrial and stated, \\"This is a case not where we're disputing that the 13 phones contain some elements of Apple's property,\\" but the company disputed the US$379.8 million amount that Apple claimed that it is owed in the wake of Samsung's‚ÄîSamsung presented a figure of US$52 million. On November 21, 2013 the jury awarded a new figure of US$290 million. The following devices were the concern of the retrial: Captivate, Continuum, Droid Charge, Epic 4G, Exhibit 4G, Galaxy Prevail, Galaxy Tab, Gem, Indulge, Infuse 4G, Nexus S 4G, Replenish, and Transform. Supreme Court decision of First Trial On December 6, 2016, the United States Supreme Court decided 8-0 to reverse the decision from the first trial that awarded nearly $400 million to Apple and returned the case to Federal Circuit court to define the appropriate legal standard to define \\"article of manufacture\\" because it is not the smartphone itself, but could be just the case and screen to which the design patents relate. Second Retrial of damages amount from first U.S. trial On Sunday, October 22, 2017 district court judge Lucy Koh ordered a second retrial of damages based upon the limitations imposed by the above decision of the United States Supreme Court. The parties were ordered to propose a schedule for a new trial by Wednesday, October 25. The jury trial for damages concluded on May 24, 2018, awarding Apple $539 million, which includes $399 million for damages of Samsung's products sold that infringed on the patents. =Second U.S. trial= Apple filed a new U.S. lawsuit in February 2012, asserting Samsung's violation of five Apple patents across Samsung's product lines for its Admire, Galaxy Nexus, Galaxy Note, Galaxy Note II, Galaxy S II, Galaxy S II Epic 4G Touch, Galaxy S II Skyrocket, Galaxy S III, Galaxy Tab II 10.1, and Stratosphere. Samsung responded with a counterclaim, stating that two patents for nine phones and tablets have been infringed on by Apple across its iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, iPhone 5, iPad 2, iPad 3, iPad 4, iPad mini, iPod touch (5th generation), iPod touch (4th generation), and MacBook Pro lines. Samsung stood to gain US$6 million if the jury rules in its favor, while Apple was seeking US$2 billion in damages and could proceed with similar lawsuits against other Android handset makers, as the relevant patent issues extend beyond Samsung's software technology. The second trial was scheduled for March 2014 and jury selection occurred on March 31, 2014. Judge Koh referred to the new lawsuit as \\"one action in a worldwide constellation of litigation between the two companies.\\" The trial began in early April and decision was delivered on May 2, 2014 and Samsung was instructed to pay US$119.6 million to Apple for smartphone patent violations, a compensatory amount that was termed a \\"big loss\\" by The Guardian's \\"Technology\\" team‚Äîthe media outlet described the victory as \\"pyrrhic.\\" The jury found that Samsung had infringed upon two Apple patents and Brian Love, assistant professor at the Santa Clara University law school, explained: \\"This amount is less than 10% of the amount Apple requested, and probably doesn't surpass by too much the amount Apple spent litigating this case.\\" Apple's official response was a reaffirmation that \\"Samsung willfully stole\\" from the Cupertino, US-based corporation; however, Apple's lawyers claimed that a technical mistake has been made by the jury and Koh ordered the jurors to return on May 5, 2014 to resolve an issue that is potentially worth several hundred thousand dollars. The jury also found Apple liable for infringing one of Samsung's patents and the South Korean corporation, which had initially sought US$6 million of damages, was awarded US$158,400. In the wake of the verdict, Judge Koh will be responsible for deciding whether a sales ban of Samsung products will be implemented, a decision that was deemed highly unlikely by legal experts, such as Rutgers Law School's Michael Carrier, after the verdict announcement. Samsung appealed the jury verdict to a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in 2015, and won in February 2016, with the panel nullifying the jury verdict. The panel unanimously argued that one patent cited by Apple was not infringed by Samsung, while two others, related to autocorrect and \\"slide to unlock\\" features, were invalid based on existing prior art. Apple requested an en banc hearing from the full Federal Circuit, which ruled in favor of Apple by an 8-3 decision, restoring the $120 million award, in October 2016. While the original three judges maintained their opinion from the previous hearing, the remaining judges argued that the three- member panel had dismissed the body of evidence from the jury trial supporting that Apple's patents were valid and Samsung was infringing upon them. Samsung appealed to the Supreme Court, but the Court announced in November 2017 that it would not hear the appeal, leaving the Federal Circuit's ruling in Apple's favor in place.Samsung Electronics Co. v.

History The facade of the former Palace Valada-Azambuja By the 16th century a palace already existed on the site, but was destroyed on 1 November 1755, following the events of the Lisbon earthquake. Following its reconstruction, the residence was occupied by the family of the 1st Marquess of Valada and 1st Count of Caparica, D. Francisco de Meneses de Silveira e Castro (1754‚Äì1834). In 1867, the palace was acquired by the council Francisco Jos√© da Silva Torres, that linked the manor to the Countess of Azambuja. By 1925, the property-owner was Manuel Henriques de Carvalho, who provided spaces in the building to the operators of the newspaper A Lucta (becoming its headquarters). Other commercial spaces were eventually opened on the ground floor. By the 1990s, a library existed in the location. The construction company, Lucios, demolished the interiors in 2004, transforming the spaces into 10 residential apartments (between T0 and T2 configurations). The project also included the remodelling of the roof and construction of an elevator. Architecture Examples of the elaborate azulejo tile within the former- residence Examples of the elaborate azulejo tile within the former-residence The three-story building forms a \\"U\\"-shaped uniform plan separated by pilasters and covered in tiled roof. There are three volumes, with three registers divided by architectural elements: the ground floor occupied by shops, the second consisting of simple rectangular windows and the final floor adorned with larger windows with rounded lintels and balustrade varanda. The central facade is surmounted by a triangular pediment with oculus, decorated by various motifs in bas-relief depicting vegetal forms. The interior is distinguished for its 18th-century azulejo panels representing gallant scenes, flanked by accented tiles forming divisions as pilasters and surmounted by vases. A marble staircase, covered in vaulted ceiling includes decoration in relief stuccos. Similarly, there are two other triangular azulejo panels depicting Saint Francis of Assisi and Saint Martial.

The second and final practice session was held on the following day and lasted 90 minutes. Mark Martin was quickest with a time of 28.507 seconds in the first session, less than four-hundredths of a second faster than Biffle. Harvick was just off Biffle's pace, followed by A. J. Allmendinger, Regan Smith, and Marcos Ambrose. Kenseth was seventh, still within two-tenths of a second of Martin's time. In the second and final practice session, Trevor Bayne was quickest with a time of 29.246 seconds. Biffle followed in the second position, ahead of Kenseth, Bowyer, and Allmendinger. Harvick was sixth after posting a time of 29.355 seconds, while Hamlin and Kurt Busch followed in seventh and eighth. Truex, Jr. and Joey Logano rounded out the first ten positions. Forty-six cars were entered for qualifying, but only forty-three raced because of NASCAR's qualifying procedure. Truex, Jr. clinched his seventh pole position during his career, with a time of 28.366 seconds. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Kenseth. Biffle qualified third, Martin took fourth, and Kasey Kahne started fifth. Newman, Ambrose, Keselowski, Jamie McMurray, and Johnson rounded out the first ten positions. The drivers who failed to qualify for the race were David Stremme, Joe Nemechek and Stacy Compton. Once the qualifying session concluded, Truex, Jr. said, \\"That's our main goal. This team's good enough. We can get to Victory Lane. We're going to do it soon. I feel good about this team. I'm just having so much fun coming to the race track and driving these cars. We're going to make them proud here pretty quick.\\" Notes * The last 234 laps went green, setting a NASCAR record for the longest consecutive green flag run on an intermediate track.

Early life William Johnson Temple was the son of William Temple of Allerdean, near Berwick-on-Tweed, where his father was mayor in 1750 and again in 1754. His mother was Sarah, daughter of Alexander Johnston of Newcastle upon Tyne, who died in 1747. Temple was baptised at Berwick as \\"William Johnson\\" on 20 December 1739. He was a fellow-student at the University of Edinburgh with James Boswell, in the class of Robert Hunter. Their correspondence is in print from 29 July 1758, by which time Temple had left Edinburgh. On 22 May in that year he was admitted pensioner at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, and on 5 February 1759 he became a scholar on that foundation. Temple's name was taken off the books on 20 November 1761, and he went to London: he and Boswell met as again law students at the end of 1762. Temple took chambers in Farrar's Buildings, at the bottom of Inner Temple Lane, and in July 1763 he lent these rooms to Boswell. His father became bankrupt towards the close of 1763, and Temple contributed to him from the proceeds of the small estate which he had inherited from his mother. To enter the church he returned to Trinity Hall, where he was admitted fellow-commoner on 22 June 1763, and took the degree of LL.B. on 28 June 1765, his name being taken off the books on 13 June 1766. Temple while at Cambridge became a close friends also to Thomas Gray. He remained in touch with Gray's circle, through Norton Nicholls.Robert L. Mack, Thomas Gray: A Life (2000), p. 558. Churchman During a visit to London in February 1766 Boswell introduced Temple to Samuel Johnson. On 14 September 1766 he was ordained deacon at Exeter, by Bishop Frederick Keppel, and on the following Sunday he was ordained priest by Keppel at a general ordination in the cathedral. Next day, on the presentation of Wilmot Vaughan, 4th Viscount Lisburne, whose family were connected with Berwick-on-Tweed, he was instituted to the rectory of Mamhead, adjoining Starcross, about ten miles from Exeter. By August 1767 Temple was married, to a lady with a fortune of ¬£1,300, but the following year, after the bankruptcy of Fenwick Stow, he was again in financial trouble. He corrected Boswell's Account of Corsica (1768). In May 1770 Temple contemplated separating from his wife, and by the following November he had sold part of his estate. After proceeding to Northumberland on this business, he visited Boswell at Chessel's Buildings, Canongate, Edinburgh (September 1770). In the spring of 1771 he was looking for a chaplaincy abroad. During a visit to London in May 1773 Temple dined at the house of Charles and Edward Dilly, the publishers in The Poultry, meeting Johnson, Oliver Goldsmith, Bennet Langton, Boswell, and others; and in April 1775 Boswell paid him a visit at Mamhead. In the meantime Temple published his first essay (1774); Bishop Keppel made him his chaplain, and by November 1775 he had received the promise of another living, St Gluvias with the chapelry of Budock. As vicar of St Gluvias from 1776, Temple spent the rest of his days. In 1792 the Cornwall Library and Literary Society was founded, mainly through Temple, at Truro. Death Temple died at St Gluvias on 13 August 1796. A monument in the churchyard was erected to the memory of their parents by \\"the seven remaining children\\". His second name is there given as Johnstone. Views Temple as man of letters compared literary London very unfavourably with Edinburgh. He did not at all share Boswell's adulation of Johnson, and in literary terms was more an ally of Gray and Horace Walpole. A hostile anonymous biographical work, The Character of Doctor Johnson (1792), has been attributed to Temple, the attribution rating only as \\"possible\\" in one authority.Open Library page, The Character of Doctor Johnson with illustrations from Mrs. Piozzi, Sir John Hawkins and Mr. Boswell. It is accepted as Temple's work by Thomas Crawford. He preached against bull- baiting. Anti-religious views and a Socinian tendency expressed privately to Boswell in the late 1760s later dropped away. In politics he held radical reforming views, until late in life these were shaken by the outcomes of the French Revolution. Works Temple's writings were: * An Essay on the Clergy, their Studies, Recreations, Decline of Influence, 1774. * On the Abuse of Unrestrained Power (anonymous), 1778. * Moral and Historical Memoirs (anonymous), 1779, including Unrestrained Power. These memoirs argued for less foreign travel, less luxury, and for less variety of reading. * A short pamphlet on Jacobinism, 1792?. Temple left unfinished a work on The Rise and Decline of Modern Rome. Some of his letters to Lord Lisburne are in the Egerton MS. His diaries were published in 1929. Boswell correspondence A character of Thomas Gray was written by Temple in a letter to Boswell a short time after the poet's death (30 July 1771), and was published by him without permission in the London Magazine for 1772. William Mason incorporated it in his Life of Gray, and Johnson included it in his memoir of Gray in Lives of the Poets. The Boswell‚ÄìTemple correspondence was reconstructed and edited over the 19th and early 20th century. A scholarly edition appeared in 1997. The correspondence was discovered by chance in Boulogne in the late 1830s. The Letters of James Boswell, addressed to the Rev. W. J. Temple, appeared in 1856, anonymously edited by Philip Francis the barrister; this edition contained 97 letters, and was a mainstay of Boswell biography. There was another edition in 1908 by Thomas Seccombe. There was an edition of Boswell's letters in 1924 by Chauncey Brewster Tinker; it was flawed as previous editions were by suppression. Some further letters of Boswell to Temple, and 338 from Temple to Boswell, came to light in the 20th century. Family Temple married Anne Stow, daughter of William Stow and Anne n√©e Blake, sister of Sir Francis Blake. She died on 14 March 1793, aged 46; they had issue in all eleven children (DNB), or eight (ODNB). One son, Francis Temple (died 19 January 1863), became vice-admiral; another, Octavius Temple (died 13 August 1834), was governor of Sierra Leone, and father of Frederick Temple.

Life She grew up in Myaungmya, an Irrawaddy delta town, the eighth of 10 brothers and sisters. Khin Kyi attended the American Baptist Mission-run Kemmendine Girls School (now Basic Education High School No. 1 Kyimyindaing) in Rangoon, and continued her tertiary education at the Teachers' Training College (TTC) in Moulmein. She then went on to become a teacher at the National School in her hometown, before deciding to give it up altogether to join the nursing profession against her mother's wishes, following the footsteps of her two elder sisters, who were at the time, training to become nurses. Khin Kyi moved to Rangoon and joined the staff of the Rangoon General Hospital as a nursing probationer. Khin Kyi first met Aung San in 1942, when he was recovering from injuries sustained during the Burma Campaign, at the Rangoon General Hospital, where she served as a senior nurse. The couple wed in September of that year. She served as a member of parliament in the country's first post-independence government from 1947 to 1948, representing Rangoon's Lanmadaw Township, the constituency that her husband had won.

Their former house was converted to the Bogyoke Aung San Museum in 1962. In 1960, Khin Kyi was appointed as Burma's Ambassador to India, and became the country's first woman to serve as the head of a diplomatic mission. During her tenure in New Delhi, Indian prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru specially arranged for Khin Kyi and Suu Kyi to live on 24 Akbar Road, in a colonial-era complex designed by Edwin Lutyens. The site, then called \\"Burma House,\\" is now the national headquarters of the Indian National Congress. She died in Rangoon on 28 December 1988, at the age of 76, after suffering a severe stroke.

Linguists use LSL as an acronym for Latvian Sign Language.  Policy and education  The Official Language Law of 9 December 1999, which came into force on 1 September 2000, gave Latvian Sign Language a legal status in Section 3.3, which stipulates: 'The State shall ensure the development and use of the Latvian sign language for communication with people with impaired hearing.' Since 2008, Latvia has been screening newborns for hearing impairment. The majority of Latvian DHI (deaf and hearing impaired) children live in boarding schools instead of with their families. The country has two specialist schools for DHI children that offer elementary education over a period of 10 or 12 years, one of which uses LSL and signed Latvian in instruction, while the other uses spoken language. In both schools, children primarily communicate amongst themselves in sign language. Aside from the two specialist schools, some schools exist which provide separate classes for DHI children, while in the remaining schools DHI children learn alongside their peers with normal hearing.  Research  Latvian Sign Language is claimed to have separated from French Sign Language some time around 1806. Mahoney (2017) conducted the first-known 100-word Swadesh‚ÄìWoodward list comparison of Latvian Sign Language and Estonian Sign Language (EVK), concluding that a possible relationship between them ‚Äì as descending from VLFS, perhaps via √ñGS and/or RSL, as Wittmann (1991) and Bickford (2005) proposed ‚Äì was 'still uncertain as it is unclear how sign languages disseminated in Eastern European countries during the Soviet Union, but aside from superficial impressions that the core lexicons are similar, signs with shared parameters displaying small variation in handshape while retaining 4 selected fingers suggests that these languages share a parent'. She added that '[a]t present there is no reason to assume that Estonian and Latvian sign language have a mother-daughter relationship'. Power et al. (2020) conducted a large-scale data study into the evolution and contemporary character of 76 of manual alphabets (MAs) of sign languages, concluding that Latvian Sign Language's manual alphabet showed characteristics that were both typical of a postulated 'Russian Group' (including Russian, Ukrainian, Bulgarian and Estonian Sign Language) as well as a postulated 'Polish Group' (including Polish and Lithuanian Sign Language), and was therefore placed in between.

It is one of a group known as the azure damselflies. It is found in Queensland (Australia) and Papua New Guinea. It typically occurs near lakes, waterfalls or streams at relatively low altitudes, and is occasionally seen near dry pools. Unusually for damselflies, it is a relatively large insect with its wings outspread at rest. It is often confused with dragonflies, although like most damselflies, the form is not as robust as dragonflies, and the eyes do not meet as with most dragonflies. Larvae are wide and flat, with long saccoid gills to breathe underwater. The inner tooth of labial palps is elongated. The specific characters of the larva are mid-ventral, distal width, basal width, and length of median lobe. Larval motor patterns were similar to larvae in the Coenagrionidae. The male tropical rockmaster has a bright blue and black body with dark wings. It can be distinguished from the sapphire rockmaster (Diphlebia coerulescens) by the smaller size of blue markings at the base (front end) and underside of terga 4 to 6. Its abdomen is otherwise black. Its wings are the widest in the genus, and the hindwings are wider than the forewings. The legs are brownish black. The female tropical rockmaster is predominantly brown and yellow-green, and also has smoky-coloured wings. The transformation from egg to adult is through an incomplete metamorphosis. Like the adult form, the nymph is also a predator. Eggs are laid underwater on moss and reeds around November. The nymphal phase lasts for approximately one year. Adults usually emerge in September and October. It is an uncommon species, though not considered under threat. It was described in 1907 by a young English-born entomologist, Robin Tillyard. He had collected the lectotype at Mervyn Creek in Queensland in January 1905. Forster collected what is now classified as the same species from around Port Moresby in New Guinea in 1910 and named it Diphlebia reinholdi.

The cause of the trial was the murder of a businessman and ex-serviceman named Alavandar whose headless body was found in one of the coaches of the Indo-Ceylon Express. After a trial which became a cause c√©l√®bre, Alavandar's ex-lover and her husband were found guilty of the murder and had been sentenced to brief terms of imprisonment. Introduction C. Alavandar, a pen salesman from Chennai was reported missing on 28 August 1952, by his employer Cunnan Chetty (the owner of Gem and Co). The next day a headless body was discovered in a third-class compartment of the Chennai- Dhanushkodi (Indo-Ceylon boatmail) express. It was found after passengers complained about a foul-smelling trunk when the train was nearing Manamadurai. Police investigating the complaint, opened the trunk and found the headless body. An autopsy done at Manamadurai concluded that the body belonged to a 25-year-old male. Since it was circumcised, the investigating police officer K.Khaja Syed Mohideen decided that the murder victim was a Muslim based on Circumcision ( removal of the upper layer of the skin in male reproductive organ) After a few days, police discovered a severed head in Royapuram beach, Chennai. It had been buried in the beach sand but was exposed due to tidal action. The head and body were sent to Madras Medical College for forensic examination. Dr. C. P. Gopalakrishnan who performed the examination concluded that both belonged to the same 42-year-old male. Alavandar's wife later identified them as her husband. Alavandar had served in the British Indian army and his fingerprints were on file there. They were used to conclusively prove that the murdered man was Alavandar. Investigation and trial The Police investigation into Alavandar's murder revealed the circumstances leading to his death. Alavandar belonged to the Komati Chetti community. In 1952, he was about 40‚Äì45 years of age and married with two children. Besides his pen shop at Parry's Corner, Chennai, Alavandar was a saree salesman. He was romantically involved with many women. One of them was Devaki Menon from Kerala. In 1951, Devaki broke off her relationship with Alavandar and married one Prabhakar Menon. But Alavandar continued to harass her. To stop Alavandar, Devaki and Prabhakar decided to murder Alavandar. Devaki called Alavandar to her house at the cemetery road on 28 August 1952. There the couple murdered Alavandar, cut his head off and buried it at Royapuram beach in Chennai. They put the body in a trunk and left it in the Indo-Ceylon Express. Then they left Chennai for Bombay.Chilling tales from old city, Indian ExpressAlavandar Murder Case Part 1, Randor GuyAlavandar Murder Case Part 2, Randor Guy The couple was arrested in Bombay and brought to Chennai for trial. The trial caused a sensation and large crowds thronged the hearings. Lawyer B. T. Sundararajan, appearing for the defense, argued that it was a homicide and not murder as there had been \\"grave provocation\\". The jury found the defendants Devaki and Prabhakar guilty. On 13 August 1953, Justice A. S. Panchapakesa Iyer awarded a seven-year rigorous imprisonment sentence to Prabhakar for culpable homicide and sentenced Devaki to three years in prison. Impact Prabhakara Menon and Devaki, eventually, served their sentences in jail and afterwards, moved to Kerala where they set up a tea shop and over the years they prospered and built a hotel in a big town in Kerala. The judge who handed down the comparatively mild sentence has often been accused of being sympathetic to the accused.

Irradiation Irradiation is the use of ionising gamma rays emitted by cobalt-60 and caesium-137, or, high-energy electrons and X-rays to inactivate microbial pathogens, particularly in the food industry. Bacteria such as Deinococcus radiodurans are particularly resistant to radiation, but are not pathogenic.Food Irradiation Active microbes, such as Corynebacterium aquaticum, Pseudomonas putida, Comamonas acidovorans, Gluconobacter cerinus, Micrococcus diversus and Rhodococcus rhodochrous, have been retrieved from spent nuclear fuel storage pools at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). These microbes were again exposed to controlled doses of radiation. All the species survived weaker radiation doses with little damage, while only the gram-positive species survived much larger doses. The spores of gram-positive bacteria contain storage proteins that bind tightly to DNA, possibly acting as a protective barrier to radiation damage. Ionising radiation kills cells indirectly by creating reactive free radicals. These free radicals can chemically alter sensitive macromolecules in the cell leading to their inactivation. Most of the cell's macromolecules are affected by ionising radiation, but damage to the DNA macromolecule is most often the cause of cell death, since DNA often contains only a single copy of its genes; proteins, on the other hand, often have several copies so that damage of one will not lead to cell death, and in any case may always be re-synthesized provided the DNA has remained intact.Irradiation of Microbes from Spent Nuclear Fuel Storage Pool Environments Ultraviolet radiation has been used as a germicide by both industry and medicine for more than a century (see Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation). Use of ultraviolet leads to both inactivation and the stimulating of mutations. A case study of an irradiated Escherichia coli population found a growing number of bacteriophage-resistant mutants induced by the light. Metal ions (Oligodynamic effect) Karl Wilhelm von N√§geli, a Swiss botanist, discovered in 1893 that the ions of various metals and their alloys such as silver and copper, but also mercury, iron, lead, zinc, bismuth, gold, aluminium and others, have a toxic effect on microbial life by denaturing microbial enzymes and thus disrupting their metabolism. This effect is negligible in viruses since they are not metabolically active. Pulsed electric fields (PEF) Strong electric field pulses applied to cells cause their membranes to develop pores (electroporation), increasing membrane permeability with a consequent and, for the cell, undesirable migration of chemicals. Pulses of low intensity may result in the increased production of secondary metabolites and a build-up of resistance. PEF treatment is an adequate process for inactivation of microbes in acids and other thermosensitive media, but holds inherent resistance dangers because of incomplete destruction. Pulsed magnetic fields (PMF) A 2004 study found that E. coli is susceptible to pulsed magnetic fields with a survivability figure of 1 in 10 000. As with PEF cell walls are rendered porous with resultant cell death. Enzymes such as lactoperoxidase, lipase and catalase are readily inactivated, though with varying degrees of susceptibility.Effect of a Pulsed Magnetic Field on the Microorganisms and Enzymes in Milk A 2010 study concentrated on the effects of PMF on Staphylococcus aureus. High power ultrasound Until recently ultrasonic systems were used for cleaning, cutting,http://www.geiss- ttt.com/www_geiss/exp_tech_trim_ultrasonic_cutting_e_134_197_0_f.htm the welding of plastics, and in medical therapy. High power ultrasound is a useful tool which is extremely versatile in its applications. Ultrasound generates cavitation bubbles within a liquid or slurry by causing the liquid molecules to vibrate. Temperatures of 5000K and pressures of up to 2000 atmospheres are routinely recorded in these bubbles. Cavitation can be produced using frequencies from the audible range up to 2 MHz, the optimum being at about 20 kHz. Generating ultrasonics requires a liquid medium and a source of ultrasound, usually from either a piezoelectric or magnetostrictive transducer. The process is used for destroying E. coli, Salmonella, Ascaris, Giardia, Cryptosporidium cysts, Cyanobacteria and Poliovirus. It is also capable of breaking down organic pesticides. The frequencies used in diagnostic ultrasound are typically between 2 and 18 MHz, and uncertainty remains about the extent of cellular damage or long-term effects of fetal scans. (see Medical ultrasonography) Low temperatures Freezing food to preserve its quality has been used since time immemorial. Freezing temperatures curb the spoiling effect of microorganisms in food, but can also preserve some pathogens unharmed for long periods of time. Freezing kills some microorganisms by physical trauma, others are sublethally injured by freezing, and may recover to become infectious. High osmotic gradients Syrup, honey, brine, alcohol and concentrated sugar or salt solutions display an antibacterial action due to osmotic pressure. Syrup and honey have a long history of being used as a topical treatment for superficial and deep wounds. Wood smoke compounds act as food preservatives. Phenol and phenolic compounds found in wood smoke are antioxidants and antimicrobials, slowing bacterial growth. Other antimicrobials in wood smoke include formaldehyde, acetic acid, and other organic acids, which give wood smoke a low pH‚Äîabout 2.5. Some of these compounds are toxic to people as well, and may have health effects in the quantities found in cooking applications. Ozone Microorganisms suffer a reduction in viability on contact with ozone which compromises the integrity of their cell walls. Gram-negative bacteria are more vulnerable to ozone than gram-positive organisms. High temperatures (see Thermization and Pasteurisation) Extreme temperatures destroy viruses and vegetative cells that are active and metabolising. Organic molecules such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipid and nucleic acids, as well as cell walls and membranes, all of which play important roles in cell metabolism, are damaged by excessive heat. Food for human consumption is routinely heated by baking, boiling and frying to temperatures which destroy most pathogens. Thermal processes often cause undesirable changes in the texture, appearance and nutritional value of foods. Autoclaves generate steam at higher than boiling point and are used to sterilise laboratory glassware, surgical instruments, and, in a growing industry, medical waste. A danger inherent in using high temperatures to destroy microbes, is their incomplete destruction through inadequate procedures with a consequent risk of producing pathogens resistant to heat. High pressures (see Pascalization) Water under very high hydrostatic pressure of up to 700 MPa (100,000 psi) inactivates pathogens such as Listeria, E. coli and Salmonella. High pressure processing (HPP) is preferred over heat treatment in the food industry as it eliminates changes in the quality of foods due to thermal degradation, resulting in fresher taste, texture, appearance and nutrition. Processing conveniently takes place at ambient or refrigeration temperatures. High Pressure Processing of Food The question whether pressure is an impediment to (microbial) life is surprisingly opposite what has been assumed for a long time. Anurag Sharma, a geochemist, James Scott, a microbiologist, and others at the Carnegie Institution of Washington performed an experiment with Diamond Anvil Cell and utilized \\"direct observations\\" on microbial activity to over 1.0 Gigapascal pressures. Their goal was to test microbes and discover under what level of pressure they can carry out life processes. The experiments were performed up to 1.6 GPa of pressure, which is more than 16,000 times Earth's surface pressure (Earth's surface pressure is 985 hPa). The experiment began by placing a solution of bacteria, specifically Escherichia coli and Shewanella oneidensis, in a film and placing it in the DAC. The pressure was then raised to 1.6 GPa. When raised to this pressure and kept there for 30 hours, at least 1% of the bacteria survived. The experimenters then added a dye to the solution and also monitored formate metabolism using in-situ Raman spectroscopy. If the cells survived the squeezing and were capable of carrying out life processes, specifically breaking down formate, the dye would turn clear. 1.6 GPa is such great pressure that during the experiment the DAC turned the solution into ice-IV, a room-temperature ice. When the bacteria broke down the formate in the ice, liquid pockets would form because of the chemical reaction. The bacteria were also able to cling to the surface of the DAC with their tails. There was some skepticism recorded with this pioneering experiment. According to Art Yayanos, an oceanographer at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography in La Jolla, California, an organism should only be considered living if it can reproduce. Another issue with the DAC experiment is that when high pressures occur, there are usually high temperatures present as well, but in this experiment there were not. This experiment was performed at room-temperature. However, the intentional lack of high temperature in the experiments isolated the actual effects of pressure on life and results clearly indicated life to be largely pressure insensitive. Newer results from independent research groups have shown the validity of Sharma et al. (2002) work. This is a significant step that reiterates the need for a new approach to the old problem of studying environmental extremes through experiments. There is practically no debate whether microbial life can survive pressures up to 600 MPa, which has been shown over the last decade or so to be valid through a number of scattered publications. What is significant in this approach of Sharma et al. 2002 work is the elegantly straightforward ability to monitor systems at extreme conditions that have since remained technically inaccessible. While the experiment shows simplicity and elegance, the results are not unexpected and are consistent with most biophysical models. This novel approach lays a foundation for future work on microbiology at non-ambient conditions by not only providing a scientific premise, but also laying the technical feasibility for future work on non-ambient biology and organic systems. High acceleration Bacterial cell surfaces may be damaged by the acceleration forces attained in centrifuges. Laboratory centrifuges routinely achieve 5000‚Äì15000g, a procedure which often kills a considerable portion of microbes, especially if they are in their exponential growth phase.

At least 5,000 children were victims of this programme, which was a precursor to the subsequent murder of children in the concentration camps.  Background  Sch√∂nbrunn Psychiatric Hospital, 1934. Photo by SS photographer Franz Bauer Social Darwinism came to play a major role in the ideology of Nazism, where it was combined with a similarly pseudo-scientific theory of racial hierarchy in order to identify the Germans as a part of what the Nazis regarded as an Aryan or Nordic master race. This ideology held unreservedly to the notion of the survival of the fittest, at both the level of the individual as well as the level of entire peoples and states. This notion claimed to have natural law on its side. All opposing religious and humanitarian views would ultimately prove to be unnatural. A people could only prove its worth in the long run in this ongoing \\"struggle for survival\\", if they promoted the best and, if necessary, eliminated those that weakened them. Moreover, only a people as racially pure as possible could maintain the \\"struggle for existence\\". To maintain or improve the Nordic-Germanic race, therefore, the laws of eugenics or the (biologistically oriented) \\"racial hygiene\\" would have to be strictly observed, that is, the promotion of the \\"genetically healthy\\" and the elimination of the \\"sick\\". All those with hereditary illnesses or who were severely mentally and physically handicapped were classified as \\"lives unworthy of life\\" (lebensunwertes Leben). They would, in terms of natural selection, be \\"eliminated\\". This form of eugenics was eventually the basis of the National Socialist genetic health policy which was elevated to the rank of state doctrine. In 1929 Hitler said at the Nazi Party Conference in Nuremberg, \\"that an average annual removal of 700,000-800,000 of the weakest of a million babies meant an increase in the power of the nation and not a weakening\\".V√∂lkischer Beobachter, Bavarian edition dated 7 August 1929.

As early as 1895, he demanded that human offspring should not: > be left to the chance encounter of a drunken moment.

This office was an agency of the Nazi Party and a private chancellery placed under the direct authority of Hitler which employed about 195 staff in 1939. Main Office IIb under Hans Hefelmann and his deputy, Richard von Hegener, was responsible for \\"clemency\\". The head of Main Office II and thus Hefelmann's superior was the Oberdienstleiter, Viktor Brack, one of the leading organizers of Nazi euthanasia. Until recently the identity of the child had not been disclosed, although it was known to German medical historians. One German historian, Udo Benzenh√∂fer, argued that the child's name could not be disclosed because of Germany's privacy laws relating to medical records. In 2007, however, the historian Ulf Schmidt, in his biography of Karl Brandt, published the child's name (Gerhard Kretschmar), the names of his parents, the place of his birth and the dates of his birth and death. Schmidt wrote: \\"Although this approach [of Benzenh√∂fer and others] is understandable and sensitive to the feelings of the parents and relatives of the child, it somehow overlooks the child itself and its individual suffering... By calling the child 'Child K', we would not only medicalise the child's history, but also place the justifiable claim of the parents for anonymity above the personality and suffering of the first 'euthanasia' victim.\\"Ulf Schmidt (2007) Karl Brandt: The Nazi Doctor. London: Hambledon Continuum. , p.118 Schmidt did not disclose whether the child's parents were still living. According to the testimony of the participants, the request on 23 May 1939 led to a meeting of the parents of the child with the director of the University Children's Hospital, Leipzig, Werner Catel, about the chances of survival of the child.Heilen und Vernichten im Nationalsozialismus. (\\"Healing and Extermination under Nazism\\"), p. 172 According to Catel's own statement, he held that the release of the child by an early death was the best solution for everyone involved. But because actively assisting death was still punishable under the Third Reich, Catel advised the parents to submit an appropriate request to Hitler via his private chancellery. About this request, in a statement before the investigating judge on 14 November 1960, Hefelmann said the following: > I worked on this request, as it was in my department. Since Hitler's > decision was requested, I forwarded it without comment to the Head of Main > Office I in the KdF, Albert Bormann. As a simple act of mercy was being > requested, I did not deem the involvement of the Reich Interior Minister and > the Minister of Justice necessary. Because, as far as I know, Hitler had not > made a decision with regards to such requests, it also seemed impractical to > me, to involve other authorities. To the recollections of his boss, Hefelmann's deputy, Richard von Hegener, added: > As early as about half a year before the outbreak of the war, there were > more and more requests from incurably sick or very seriously injured people > who asked for relief from their suffering, which was unbearable to them. > These requests were especially tragic, because under existing laws a doctor > was not allowed to take such wishes into account. Because the department, as > we were reminded again and again, was under Hitler's orders to deal on > precisely with such cases that could not be resolved legally, Dr. Hefelmann > and I felt committed, after a while to take a number of such requests to > Hitler's personal physician, the then senior doctor, Dr. Brandt, for him to > submit and obtain a decision from Hitler on what should be done with such > requests. Soon afterwards, Dr. Brandt told us that Hitler had decided, > following this presentation, to grant such requests if it was proven by the > doctor attending the patient as well as the newly formed health committee, > that the suffering was incurable.Gauck-Beh√∂rde, EZVl/1 A.1, Akte von > Hegener, zitiert nach Ulf Schmidt: Kriegsausbruch und Euthanasie.

Results of Recent Research into the > \\"Knauer Child\\" in 1939\\".  Reich Committee for the Scientific Registering of Serious Hereditary and Congenital Illnesses  This first child euthanasia death led to a significant acceleration in the implementation of latent plans for \\"eugenic extermination\\", which began with the Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring, enacted on 14 July 1933, and eventually led in several stages to the euthanasia of children and adults (see Action T4, background and historical context). There was an almost parallel development of the decisions that resulted in the euthanasia programme for these two groups. Viktor Brack testifies in his own defence at the Doctors' Trial in Nuremberg in 1947 Hefelmann described this further development: > The Knauer case led to Hitler authorizing Brandt and Bouhler to do likewise > in cases of a similar nature to that of the Knauer child. Whether this > authorization was granted in writing or verbally, I cannot say. In any case, > Brandt did not show us a written authorization.

M. Az.: Ks 2/63 vs. Prof. > Werner Heyde et al., p. 117 ff., cited from Klee: Euthanasie im NS-Staat. > (\\"Euthanasia in the Nazi State\\"), p. 78 ff. Karl Brandt on trial, 20 August 1947 The matter was initially discussed with an inner circle comprising Hefelmann and Hegener, head of the KdF's Central Office II, Viktor Brack and the person responsible for mental hospitals in Division IV (Health and Social Welfare) of the Reich Interior Ministry, Herbert Linden. In addition to the aforementioned, the committee assembled to organize child euthanasia consisted of Karl Brandt, the ophthalmologist Hellmuth Unger, a pediatrician Ernst Wentzler, the child psychiatrist Hans Heinze, and very probably also Professor Werner Catel. The issues at stake, which were also pertinent to preparations for the now impending adult euthanasia programme, were clarified in a brief but effective planning phase so that some three weeks after the first euthanasia case, a front organization was established under the name \\"Reich Committee for the Scientific Registration of Hereditary and Congenital Illnesses\\", that began to take the first concrete steps towards registering potential victims. The primary agents behind the front group were Hefelmann and Hegener from Office IIb of the KdF, who, at Hitler's request were not to appear publicly, nor was the only representative of a governmental authority, Linden from the Reich Interior Ministry. The so-called \\"national committee\\" was thus simply a \\"postbox\\" (Berlin W 9, PO Box 101).c.f. Briefkopf Lempp-Schreiben Correspondence went via this postbox to the KdF located in the New Reich Chancellery in Berlin's Vo√üstra√üe 4.  Identification of victims and \\"peer review\\"  The key document was a circular from the Reich Minister of the Interior of 18 August 1939, Ref: IVb 3088/39 - 1079 Mi, which was marked \\"Strictly Confidential\\" and specified the groups to be included and how they were to be assembled. After that, doctors and midwives together with maternity hospitals, obstetric departments and children's hospitals, except where a senior doctor was not present or did not get the instruction, were required to report in writing to the appropriate health authorities: > if the newborn child is suspected of being afflicted with the following > congenital disorders: * 1) Idiocy and mongolism (especially cases combined > with blindness and deafness), * 2) Microcephaly * 3) Hydrocephalus, to a > severe or advanced degree * 4) Malformations of all kinds, particularly the > absence of limbs, severe midline defects of the head and spine, etc. * 5) > Paralysis, including cerebral palsy.Cited from Klee: Euthanasie im NS-Staat. > (\\"Euthanasia in the Nazi state\\"), p.80 A template of a reporting form was enclosed with the circular, which had to be sent by public health authorities as required to their higher administrative authority. This form was withdrawn by a decree of 7 June 1940 and replaced by an improved one.Illustrated by Klee: Euthanasie im NS-Staat. (\\"Euthanasia in the Nazi state\\"), pp. 296 ff. Uniquely, a reward of 2 RM for each report was given to the midwives affected \\"for professional services rendered\\".Section 4 of the Circular of 18 August 1939 Initially only children under the age of 3 were to be reported. The prescribed registration form gave the impression that registration was only being sought with the aim of providing special medical care. The district doctors sent the completed registration form to the National Committee where Office IIb of the KdF with its two medical laymen, Hefelmann and Hegener, screened out cases that they considered should not be sent to a \\"Special Children's Ward\\", i.e. which meant that they were not eligible for euthanasia. Of approximately 100,000 registration forms received up to 1945, about 80,000 were screened out. For the professional assessment of the remaining 20,000, three experts were appointed from the National Committee who had been heavily involved in the preparatory committee, namely Werner Catel, Hans Heinze and Ernst Wentzler. Hefelmann commented later, > that Professor Heinze and Dr. Wentzler [...] supported euthanasia with great > enthusiasm and Professor Catel with conviction, and so they agreed without > any pressure to so act as expert assessors.Hefelmann testimony before the > Bavarian State Office of Criminal Investigations on 31 August 1960 Ref: > IIIa/SK-K5526 cited by Klee: Was sie taten ‚Äì was sie wurden. (What they did > - what they were\\"), p.139. These three received the registration forms in sequence, so that the third expert knew the assessment of his two predecessors. The decision over life or death of the child was taken only on the basis of the reporting form, without the experts having seen the child's medical records nor the child in person. If a child was assessed as a euthanasia case, the reviewers gave it a red \\"+\\" and conversely a blue \\"-\\" if it was screened out. If no clear decision was possible from the perspective of the evaluators a \\"B\\" for Beobachtung (\\"observation\\") was entered. These children were temporarily reprieved of euthanasia, but still committed to a \\"Special Children's Ward\\". Following closer examination the local doctor then had to make an appropriate observation report to the National Committee. The decisive criteria for a \\"positive\\" assessment were the child's projected work and education disability. According to a statement by the senior doctor, , who ran the \\"Special Children's Ward\\" of the , 95% of the assigned children came with the authority to \\"treat\\", a euphemism for the killing. Only the remaining 5% were observed and further investigated.Schmidt's statement on 3 December 1946 in the Eichberg trial, Main State Archive, Wiesbaden Division, 461 No. 32442 Vol. 4, cited by Vanje et al.: Wissen und irren. (\\"Know and err\\") p. 223 ff. Included on these forms was a section indicating the race of the patient, for which 'Jew' could be entered if applicable. Among the best preserved of these evaluation records belonged to an adult patient,\\"Klara B.,\\" who was institutionalized at Am Steinhof, where the Children's Ward Am Spiegelgrund was also located. Highlighted in red pen are the terms \\"J√ºdin\\" (Jew) and her diagnosis of \\"Schizophrenia\\". The red \\"+\\"s on the bottom left of her form marked her for euthanasia. She was transferred from the Vienna facility to Hartheim, where she was gassed on August 8, 1940, at the age of 31. The health authority responsible and the proposed \\"Special Children's Ward\\" received a notice from the National Committee of its decision and assignment. The local doctor then had to initiate the referral and notify the parents. The latter, however, were deliberately misled about the actual purpose of the referral, being tricked into believing it was for the special care and treatment of their children by specially equipped departments. Coercive measures were initially avoided. However, if parents persistently refused to agree to the referral of their child, they could be threatened with the loss of parental rights as of September 1941.Decree by the Reich Minister of the Interior of 20 September 1941 Az.: IVb 1981/41 ‚Äì 1079 Mi, \\"Betrifft: Behandlung mi√ügestalteter usw. Neugeborener\\", last paragraph, cited by Klee: Euthanasie im NS-Staat. (\\"Euthanasia in the Nazi State\\"), p. 303 ff. As early as the first half of 1941 the age of the children was specified as up to 16 years in order to prevent mentally or physically disabled young people being gassed as victims of a \\"summary method\\" within the framework of the Action T4.Klee: Euthanasie im NS-Staat. p. 379Aly: Aktion T4, p. 122 The circle of those affected was widened more and more. In addition to the mentally and physically handicapped all so-called psychopaths were subsequently registered. In the Kalmenhof therapy centre, those \\"unfit for society\\" (that is, pupils with behavioural problems) were sent to the Nazi euthanasia centre of Hadamar to be gassed or, after Action T4 was stopped, to be killed by the administering of lethal drugs. Hadamar established its own \\"nurturing home\\" for this purpose. At least 40 to 45 of the inmates were killed using drug overdoses here, a method practised in the adult euthanasia programme.Sandner: Verwaltung des Krankenmordes. (\\"Management of Killing the Sick\\"), p. 58  \\"Special Children's Wards\\"  A circular dated 1 July 1940 Ref: IVb-2140/1079 Mi, which was published in the ministerial journal of the Reich and Prussian Ministry of the Interior, informed the Ministry that the \\"National Committee\\": > had now established a youth psychiatric department in the G√∂rden State > Institute near Brandenburg a.H. that employed under scientific direction all > therapeutic options available based on the latest scientific findings.Cited > by Klee: Euthanasie im NS-Staat. p. 300 In fact the first \\"Special Children's Ward\\" had been established in G√∂rden State Institute in October 1939. The head of this institute was National Committee assessor, Hans Heinze. Hefelmann recalled \\"about 30 special children's wards\\" in his statement on 17 May 1961.Generalstaatsanwaltschaft Frankfurt a. M. Ks 2/63, Ordner T4-Zeugen, cited by Klee: Euthanasie im NS- Staat. p. 300 f. According to the current state of research about 37 \\"children's wards\\",Angelika Ebbinghaus, Klaus D√∂rner (ed.): Vernichten und Heilen. Der N√ºrnberger √Ñrzteproze√ü und seine Folgen. (\\"Destroy and Heal. The Nuremberg Doctors' Trail and its Consequences\\"), p. 302 were set up in existing medical and nursing homes, children's hospitals and university clinics. The practical difficulties in implementing the arrangements may be seen from another circular by the Minister of the Interior on 20 September 1941 Az.: IVb-1981/41-1079 Mi. Reich Health Leader and Secretary of State Leonardo Conti pointed out the fundamental importance of the matter to the national community. He made clear once again that the placing of sick children in asylums: > prevents the neglect by the family of other healthy children [...] The > National Committee for the Scientific Registration of Hereditary and > Congenital Illnesses has appointed outstanding experts on the relevant > sphere of medical specialisation to carry out its duties [...] The National > Committee still has funds available to intervene in those specific cases > where the parents may not be in need of help, but may find it difficult to > shoulder the cost of institutional care themselves.Cited by Klee.Euthanasie > im NS-Staat. (\\"Euthanasia in the Nazi State\\"), pp. 303 ff. Local doctors were instructed to oversee the reporting task laid on the midwives, to support the work of the National Committee in every way and, if necessary, put the necessary pressure on the parents.  Children as objects of medical research  Sergio de Simone (29 Nov 1937‚Äì20 April 1945) 7 yr. old Jewish Italian boy killed at the Bullenhauser Damm School Even though the children authorised for \\"treatment\\" were to be killed immediately as a rule, they were sometimes used for months in scientific research. For example, there was close collaboration between the head of the \\"Special Children's Ward\\" in the Eichberg State Mental Hospital, , and the director of the University of Heidelberg's Psychiatric Clinic, Carl Schneider. These victims were closely observed clinically in Heidelberg and then moved to Eichberg, where they were killed and their brains were removed. There is evidence of a study of 52 children with disabilities, of which at least 21 were later killed in Eichberg.Carola Sachse, Benoit Massin: Biowissenschaftliche Forschung am Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut und die Verbrechen des NS-Regimes. Informationen √ºber den gegenw√§rtigen Wissensstand. p. 32 ff. Schneider then received the preserved brains for his histopathological research. The Children's Ward Am Spiegelgrund in Vienna earned a similar notoriety, as the primary institution of Heinrich Gross, who served as its head for two years during Nazi occupation. At least 789 children lost their lives via gassing, lethal injection, malnutrition, disease, or neglect; after autopsy, many of their brains were kept for research. Dr. Gross performed unauthorized autopsies on the brains of his child victims and, between the years 1954 and 1978, published 34 works dedicated to ‚Äòcases of congenital and early onset mental disorders‚Äô. In the 1950s, Gross donated partial corpses of approximately twenty Spiegelgrund victims to the Neurological Institute of the University of Vienna, which formed the basis of at least two publications. Authors of these publications included and Hans Hoff, among others. These same ‚Äòspecimens‚Äô- unlawfully taken from these child victims- were further passed on to the Max Planck Institute for Brain Research, at the time headed by Julius Hallervorden. On the night of 20 April 1945, 20 Jewish children who had been used in medical experiments at Neuengamme, their four adult Jewish caretakers and six Red Army prisoners of war (POWs) were killed in the basement of the school. Later that evening, 24 Soviet POWs who had also been used in the experiments were brought to the school to be murdered. The names, ages and countries of origin were recorded by Hans Meyer, one of the thousands of Scandinavian prisoners released to the custody of Sweden in the closing months of the war. Neuengamme was used as a transit camp for these prisoners.Bystanders to the Holocaust: a re-evaluation By David Cesarani, Paul A.

After pursuing an academic career in India for most of two decades, he accepted an invitation to head a Buddhist centre in Birmingham UK, and over the next three decades gained an international reputation as a teacher of meditation and an advocate of peace and reconciliation. Life and career The young Rewata was first ordained as a novice at the age of 12, and received higher ordination at the age of 20. In 1953, he was awarded the title Sasanadhaja Siripavara Dhammacariya, after achieving distinctions in a state examination in Pali. Then, having received a state scholarship, he left for India in 1956 to continue his education at Varanasi University, using the expanded name of Rewata Dhamma for his passport. In 1960, he obtained a BA in Mahayana Buddhism; in 1964 an MA in Sanskrit and Indian philosophy; and in 1967, a PhD. He now became a university lecturer and published works in Pali and Hindi, including the Abhidhammatta Sangaha, which was awarded the Kalidasa Prize by the Hindi Academy in 1967. In 1975 he relocated to England to establish a Buddhist centre in Birmingham which catered for both Theravadins and followers of the Tibetan Karma Kagyu school. Later he set up his own monastery and then went on to sponsor the Dhamma Talaka Pagoda, which officially opened in 1998. He also helped establish meditation centers throughout Europe as well as in North, Central and South America. During that time he lectured at several universities on Buddhist subjects and attended numerous conferences dealing with the application of religious practice to bringing about political and economic justice, harmony among religions and ecological responsibility. From the 1990s too, books by him in English began to appear, the last three only posthumously. In 2002, the Burmese government conferred on him the title Agga Maha Pandita. Throughout his career, Dr Rewata Dhamma championed the cause of national reconciliation, speaking to international bodies such as the United Nations and Amnesty International. He was one of Aung San Suu Kyi's most influential Buddhist mentors, first meeting in Rangoon and becoming acquainted with Khin Kyi and Suu Kyi during their residence in India, in the 1960s, and then becoming reacquainted while conducting meditation retreats at the Oakenholt Centre near Oxford.Lovelock, Yann, The Joyful Traveller, 2005, pp.5, 9 Bibliography *Anuruddhacariya‚Äôs Abhidhammatta Sangaha with Sumangala Samitthera‚Äôs Abhidhammattha Vibhavantika, edited and revised by Bhandanta Rewatadhammathera.

His ancestral name was Ji, given name Ju, and Duke Jing was his posthumous title. He succeeded his father Duke Cheng of Jin, who died in 600 BC. Battle of Bi In 597 BC, the third year of Duke Jing's rule, King Zhuang of Chu attacked the State of Zheng, then a Jin ally. Duke Jing dispatched an army led by Xun Linfu (ËçÄÊûóÁà∂), Sui Hui (Èö®ÊúÉ), and Zhao Shuo (Ë∂ôÊúî) to help Zheng. By the time the Jin army arrived, however, Zheng had already surrendered to Chu. Xun Linfu wanted to return to Jin, but general Xian Hu (ÂÖàÁ∏†) persuaded him to attack Chu. The Jin army was then decisively defeated at the Battle of Bi by the Chu and Zheng forces. After the battle King Zhuang of Chu was recognized as the Hegemon of China. Although Jin was weakened by the defeat, it was still one of the strongest states of China. Just two years later Jin attacked Zheng in retaliation for helping Chu in the Battle of Bi. Conquest of the Red Di Xian Hu, who was partly responsible for Jin's defeat at the Battle of Bi, escaped to the Red Di tribes for fear of punishment. In 596 BC, the Red Di people took advantage of Jin's recent defeat and attacked Jin with Xian Hu's help. Jin killed Xian Hu and his entire clan. Chapter XIII. Duke Jing's elder sister Bo Ji was the wife of Ying'er (Â¨∞ÂÖí), the ruler of Lushi (ÊΩûÊ∞è), a major Red Di state. In 594 BC Bo Ji was killed by the Lushi minister Feng Shu. In retaliation, general Xun Linfu attacked Lushi, conquering the state and capturing its ruler Ying'er. Feng Shu fled to the State of Wey but was returned to Jin and killed. The following year, Jin conquered several more Red Di states or tribes. Chapter XV. Battle of An In 589 BC the State of Qi, another major power, attacked the states of Lu and Wey, two Jin allies, and annexed the Lu city of Long. In response, Duke Jing dispatched the Jin army led by generals Xi Ke, Shi Xie, Luan Shu, and Han Jue to help his allies. The Jin and Qi forces fought at An (near present-day Jinan), and Jin decisively defeated Qi. The Qi ruler Duke Qing narrowly escaped capture by exchanging clothes and position with officer Pang Choufu (ÈÄ¢‰∏ëÁà∂), who was taken prisoner by Han Jue mistaking him as Duke Qing. After the battle Duke Qing was forced to plead for peace and cede territory to the state of Lu. Winning the Battle of An enabled Jin to regain much of its prestige lost at the Battle of Bi, and expand its armed forces from three armies to six. Chapter II. Abdication and death In summer 581 BC, the 19th year of his reign, Duke Jing fell ill. He abdicated in favor of his son Duke Li of Jin, and died a month later. The events surrounding his death are detailed in the Chinese classic text Zuo Zhuan. Chapter X. According to the Zuo Zhuan, the duke first dreamt of a malevolent spirit. After waking, he consulted a wu (a shaman), who told him that he would not live to eat the new harvest's wheat. The duke's illness worsened and he had a new dream in which two urchins, apparently personifying his disease, taunted him, saying that medicine cannot reach them. A physician from the state of Qin was consulted. He told the duke that the disease had reached the gaohuang (ËÜèËÇì), the fatty region between the heart and diaphragm, and was therefore incurable. The duke praised the physician for his skill and sent him away lavishly. On day bingwu of the sixth month (August-September), the duke asked for and was presented with the new harvest wheat. Believing the shaman to have made a wrong prediction, he summoned him, showed him the new wheat, and had him executed. Just as he was about to eat, the duke felt bloated, went to the toilet, fell in, and died. At noon, a slave carried the duke's body out of the toilet. Earlier that morning, the slave had a dream that he was carrying his lord to the heavens. Consequently, the slave was buried with the duke to serve him in the afterlife.„ÄäÂ∑¶ÂÇ≥¬∑ÊàêÂÖ¨ÂçÅÂπ¥„ÄãÔºöÊôâ‰æØÂ§¢Â§ßÂé≤‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ÂÖ¨Ë¶∫ÔºåÂè¨Ê°ëÁî∞Â∑´„ÄÇÂ∑´Ë®ÄÂ¶ÇÂ§¢„ÄÇÂÖ¨Êõ∞Ôºö„Äå‰ΩïÂ¶ÇÔºü„ÄçÊõ∞Ôºö„Äå‰∏çÈ£üÊñ∞Áü£„ÄÇ„ÄçÂÖ¨ÁñæÁóÖÔºåÊ±ÇÈÜ´ÊñºÁß¶„ÄÇÁß¶‰ºØ‰ΩøÈÜ´Á∑©ÁÇ∫‰πã„ÄÇÊú™Ëá≥ÔºåÂÖ¨Â§¢ÁñæÁÇ∫‰∫åË±éÂ≠êÔºåÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂΩºÔºåËâØÈÜ´‰πü„ÄÇÊáºÂÇ∑ÊàëÔºåÁÑâÈÄÉ‰πãÔºü„ÄçÂÖ∂‰∏ÄÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂ±ÖËÇì‰πã‰∏äÔºåËÜè‰πã‰∏ãÔºåËã•Êàë‰ΩïÔºü„ÄçÈÜ´Ëá≥ÔºåÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÁñæ‰∏çÂèØÁÇ∫‰πü„ÄÇÂú®ËÇì‰πã‰∏äÔºåËÜè‰πã‰∏ãÔºåÊîª‰πã‰∏çÂèØÔºåÈÅî‰πã‰∏çÂèäÔºåËó•‰∏çËá≥ÁÑâÔºå‰∏çÂèØÁÇ∫‰πü„ÄÇ„ÄçÂÖ¨Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄåËâØÈÜ´‰πü„ÄÇ„ÄçÂéöÁÇ∫‰πãÁ¶ÆËÄåÊ≠∏‰πã„ÄÇÂÖ≠Êúà‰∏ôÂçàÔºåÊôâ‰æØÊ¨≤È∫•Ôºå‰ΩøÁî∏‰∫∫ÁçªÈ∫•ÔºåÈ•ã‰∫∫ÁÇ∫‰πã„ÄÇÂè¨Ê°ëÁî∞Â∑´ÔºåÁ§∫ËÄåÊÆ∫‰πã„ÄÇÂ∞áÈ£üÔºåÂºµÔºåÂ¶ÇÂªÅÔºåÈô∑ËÄåÂçí„ÄÇÂ∞èËá£ÊúâÊô®Â§¢Ë≤†ÂÖ¨‰ª•ÁôªÂ§©ÔºåÂèäÊó•‰∏≠ÔºåË≤†Êôâ‰æØÂá∫Ë´∏ÂªÅÔºåÈÅÇ‰ª•ÁÇ∫ÊÆâ„ÄÇ This vivid account has given rise to a chengyu (four-character classical idiom), ÁóÖÂÖ•ËÜèËÇì ('the disease has entered the gaohuang'), used to describe an incurable illness, or more broadly, a situation beyond remediation.

He is the founder of the Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR), a leading group in the 2011-2012 Bahraini uprising. Formation of BYSHR and charges Al-Maskati serves as the president of the BYSHR, an organization which \\"organises training workshops, monitors and documents human rights violations and participates in forming a regional network for young human rights activists in eight Arab countries\\". As part of the group's work, al-Maskati lobbied for the freedom of Egyptian blogger Kareem Amer as well as reporting on domestic human trafficking in Bahrain. In June 2005, the BYSHR attempted to register as a non-governmental organization with the Bahraini government, but was refused. When the group nonetheless continued its work, al-Maskati was summoned to court in 2007 on charges of leading an \\"unregistered organization\\", which carried a maximum sentence of six months imprisonment. The International Freedom of Expression Exchange issued an appeal for a letter writing campaign on his behalf, describing the arrest as \\"just the latest example of the government using judicial measures to silence human rights activists\\". Al-Maskati's trial was later postponed until 2009, In June 2010, al-Maskati was found guilty and ordered to pay a fine of 500 Bahraini dinar (About 1000 Euros). The Bahrain Centre for Human Rights protested the sentence, describing it as \\"a continuation of the Authority's policy in Bahrain to restrict civil society institutions\\". Role in 2011-2012 Bahraini uprising In February 2011, Bahrain saw a series of large-scale pro-democracy protests as part of the international Arab Spring. Al-Maskati and the BYSHR were active at Pearl Roundabout in the capital of Manama, which quickly became a center for the protests. Among the protestors' demands were a new constitution and the replacement of Prime Minister Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa‚Äîan uncle of Bahrain's king who had held the post since 1971‚Äîwith an elected official. In March, he was named in a widely circulated text message death threat, causing Amnesty International to call on Bahraini authorities to investigate and provide him police protection. As a result, he received a number of death threats by telephone. On 9 April, al-Maskati was present for a pre-dawn raid on the home of Bahrain Centre for Human Rights co-founder Abdulhadi al- Khawaja, by masked policemen. Al-Maskati alleges that the arresting officers struck him and placed a boot on his neck after he was handcuffed and lying face-down on the ground, but later released him after recognizing his name. Al-Khawaja was taken to prison. On 1 June, following the end of eleven weeks of martial law, al-Maskati helped organize a series of coordinated protests across Bahrain, particularly in Shiite-majority villages unhappy with Bahrain's Sunni royal family. In late 2011, al-Maskati was arrested for his \\"cyberdissidence\\" but later released; the arrest was protested in Reporters Without Borders' Internet Enemies report. In December, he was again the target of a death threat, this time by Adel Flaifel, a former State Security Services official writing on Twitter. In February 2012, Al-Maskati participated in the one-year anniversary of the Pearl Roundabout protests, reporting to international news agencies by phone that police were \\"storming houses suspected of harboring demonstrators, using tear gas, closing roads and arresting people\\".

It was found in the Lohan Cura Formation, in Argentina and lived during the Early Cretaceous, Aptian to Albian. The type species is C. windhauseni, named by Carballido and colleagues in 2012. It had originally been assigned to Limaysaurus by Salgado et al. (2004), but was later assigned its own genus based on the presence of diagnostic characters in the caudal centra, pubis and ischium. Comahuesaurus is known from abundant material compared to other rebbachisaurids; 37 caudal vertebrae, three fragmentary dorsal vertebrae and multiple appendicular elements, including a right humerus, pubis, ischium and a 113 cm long left femur. In their phylogenetic analysis, Carballido et al.

It shares with more derived rebbachisaurids a reduced hyposphene-hypantrum system, but hadn't yet completely lost said structure; that change would happen at some further point in the evolution of the clade, as it is so far only known to be fully absent in limaysaurines.

Released in 1972 it entered the UK chart in September, reaching number 3 in October. Stewart's vocals are not credited on the record label, although the popularity of the song can be attributed to his vocals and star profile. Song history The song was written in the 1960s by the group's keyboard player and singer, Dave Bentley. Believing his vocals were not correct for the song, Bentley brought in Rod Stewart. Before being successful with Faces or in his solo career, Stewart was recruited as a session musician for the song and paid by being bought a new set of seat covers for his car. Issued in October 1970, it did not make the charts. Re-released in 1972 following the rise to stardom by Stewart, the song reached number 56 in the US charts before greater success in the UK later that year. Stewart re-recorded the song in 1992 with David Gilmour and John Paul Jones but did not release it. The recording was eventually released in 2009 as part of The Rod Stewart Sessions 1971-1998 box set. The Python Lee Jackson version was later sampled in A$AP Rocky's 2015 single \\"Everyday\\", which credited Stewart as a feature and also guest starred Miguel and Mark Ronson.

The narrative follows an 11-year-old Jewish boy who stays with a prostitute in a Ukrainian ghetto during World War II. Appelfeld said that with the book, he \\"wanted to explore the darkest places of human behavior and to show that even there, generosity and love can survive; that humanity and love can overcome cruelty and brutality\\". The novel, translated by Jeffrey M. Green won the Independent Foreign Fiction Prize in 2012. Reception Carole Angier reviewed the book for The Independent, and mentioned two other works which combine the Holocaust and sexuality‚ÄîThe Night Porter and The Kindly Ones‚Äîbut wrote that Blooms of Darkness is fundamentally different: \\"Too often, in the others, the sex seems to be the point. Here the point is the nature of memory, the growth of a writer, and above all the psychology of persecution and survival. The parents' dilemma of how to live with horror, and what to tell the children; Hugo's inexorable forgetting; the inability to understand what you fear ‚Äì for Hugo, the meaning of 'whore', for survivors, the fact that most will never return ‚Äì all are caught in Appelfeld's glancing, delicate prose.\\" Shoshana Olidort of the Jewish Review of Books wrote: \\"The novel has all the characteristic trademarks of an Appelfeld work, yet it is less effective than many of his earlier books.

It is the second block set on the plane of Ravnica, after the Ravnica block, and again focuses on the multicolor cards and ten guilds of Ravnica. Return to Ravnica focuses on five guilds: the Izzet League, Cult of Rakdos, Golgari Swarm, Azorius Senate, and Selesnya Conclave. Gatecrash focuses on the other five guilds: the Boros Legion, House Dimir, The Orzhov Syndicate, The Gruul Clans, and The Simic Combine. All ten guilds appear in Dragon's Maze.  Storyline  The story told vaguely in the cards deals with the Izzet League searching for something deep within Ravnica's bowels and the other guilds responding to their mysterious actions. This is largely due to the collapse of the Guildpact, which kept the guilds in relative peace for almost 10,000 years, mainly because of the desires of the parun (original founder) of the House Dimir, Szadek, who signed the Guildpact on the condition that the Dimir remain a secret. The storyline of Gatecrash deals with the rise of another faction that does not ally with any of the Guilds, referred to in- game as the \\"Gateless\\".' The Gateless were referred to in the first set in certain cards as well. While the Gateless are rising to power, the guilds are in the process of trying to thwart each other, adding layers to the story. The Dragon's Maze set marks the culmination of the Izzet League's research into the depths of Ravnica, the eponymous Dragon's Maze (also known as the Implicit Maze), a path that treads all 10 guild gates in order to find and activate an energy source of enough power to allow the winner of the maze to subjugate and control all of the other guilds. By this point, the other guilds have gotten suspicious of something, partially by the Dimir spreading rumors, about the Izzet's true purpose for their experiments, and have begun to arm themselves for an all-out war. Niv-Mizzet, leader of the Izzet League, seeing it as the only way to avoid a complete obliteration of all the guilds by each other, proposes a challenge in which each guild selects a champion in order to navigate and conquer the maze and subsequently the other guilds. Each Champion, also called a Mazerunner, will have to traverse the maze, and they will have to deal with other guilds' attempts to halt their advance.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZf08OBag4o Like in the original Ravnica block, each Mazerunner is a Legendary Creature card. = Guilds = Most of the citizenry are members of one of the ten guilds, each a unique organization with its own rules and specialties and specializing in a unique two-color combination of magic. *The Izzet League: The mad scientists and crazed engineers of Ravnica, the Izzet specialize in blue and red magic. *The Azorius Senate: The order-obsessed lawmakers of Ravnica, the Azorius specialize in white and blue magic. *The Selesnya Conclave: The utilitarian nature-lovers of Ravnica, the Selesnya specialize in green and white magic. *The Golgari Swarm: The rot farmers and necromancers of Ravnica, the Golgari specialize in black and green magic. *The Cult of Rakdos: The demon- worshipping hedonists-for-hire of Ravnica, the Rakdos specialize in red and black magic. *The Gruul Clans: Formerly the protectors of uncivilized nature, the brutish Gruul were sidelined by the other green guilds as the city expanded. They specialize in green and red magic. *The Simic Combine: The extreme biologists of Ravnica, the Simic specialize in blue and green magic. *The House Dimir: The subtle criminals working both for whoever hired them and for their own purposes, the Dimir specialize in black and blue magic. *The Orzhov Syndicate: \\"The Church of Deals\\", the Orzhov honor money above all else. They specialize in black and white magic. *The Boros Legion: The militaristic law enforcers of Ravnica, the Boros specialize in white and red magic. = The Implicit Maze = The maze's origins are shrouded in mystery, but some details have been figured out by the Planeswalker Jace Beleren and the dragon Niv-Mizzet. It was created by the parun of the Azorius Senate, Azor. His intentions are unknown, but since it goes through various landmarks of all ten guilds, it seems to be a test of teamwork. However, the prize is too great for any guild to work with another and then share the prize, so it devolved into a huge competition with each guild using its specialties to attack all the other maze-runners on their turf. The Maze-Runners are as follows: *Melek (Izzet): A Weird Wizard who was created by Izzet mages for the sole purpose of being the perfect Maze-Runner, his biggest obstacle might be the desire of Ral Zarek to run the maze for the Izzet. His 2/4 card allows players to play instants and sorceries from the top of their library and make a free copy of them. *Vorel (Simic): A Human Merfolk whose strategic mind drew him from leading his small Gruul clan to the Simic Combine, he is one of the most passionate about the biomancy of his new guild. His 1/4 card allows his controller to multiply the counters on permanents they control. *Ruric Thar (Gruul): An Ogre Warrior (or possibly two that share the same two-headed body) who remains the only creature to challenge Borborygmos for leadership of the Clans and live to tell the tale. Ruric's 6/6 card inflicts a penalty of six life to players for each noncreature spell they cast. *Tajic (Boros): A Human Soldier who's highly regarded in the Legion because of his zealous battlefield tactics. His 2/2 Indestructible card gets +5/+5 when attacking with at least two other creatures. *Emmara Tandris (Selesnya): An Elf Shaman who was trained as a healer, she was selected by Trostani because of her selflessness and duty of protecting the Conclave. Her 5/7 card prevents all damage done to creature tokens on her side of the field. *Varolz (Golgari): A Troll Warrior who, instead of weakening with sustained damage, actually grows stronger. His 2/2 card gives all creatures in his controller's graveyard Scavenge and can regenerate by sacrificing another creature. *Teysa (Orzhov): A Human Advisor who, while she doesn't actually rule the Syndicate, has a major hand in the workings of the Orzhov. Her 4/4 card with Vigilance and Protection from Creatures destroys all creatures that deal damage to her controller and gives her controller a 1/1 white and black Spirit token for each one. *Lavinia (Azorius): A Human Soldier who is one of the best arresters in the Tenth District, she believes in stopping at nothing to uphold the law, even if that means beating the others through the maze. Her 4/4 card has Protection from Red and Detains all opponents' nonland permanents with a converted mana cost of 4 or less. *Mirko Vosk (Dimir): A Vampire who's especially skilled at finding secrets and exploiting his enemies' weaknesses, he's the perfect choice for the Dimir. His 2/4 card with Flying gives \\"Milling\\" players a distinct advantage: Whenever he deals combat damage, the player he targeted mills cards from his deck until they've milled four lands. *Exava (Rakdos): A Human Cleric who commands a massive horde of blood-crazed warriors and has a wide variety of sadistic spells at her disposal. Her 3/3 card with First Strike, Unleash, and Haste gives all other creatures on her side of the field with +1/+1 counters Haste.  Set details  The Return to Ravnica block features a return of the hybrid mana cost as well as the famous \\"dual shock lands\\" from the original Ravnica block. The set also features many cycles of cards that are aligned with certain guilds. Each guild has a charm (last featured in the Shards of Alara block) that offers a caster the choice of three options. Each guild has a multicolored land known as a Guildgate and also a shockland; controlling a Guildgate allows a player to tap it for one mana of either color of that guild. Each guild has a legendary leader (in Return to Ravnica or Gatecrash), a legendary champion (in Dragon's Maze) and a guildmage.Return to Ravnica Player's Guide Return to Ravnica features the Planeswalkers of (The most recent incarnation of the blue member of the Lorwyn Five, this time living in his adopted home of Ravnica) and the new black/green (Her name is actually derived from the Czech for \\"ditch\\" or \\"furrow\\", probably as a reference to her rise to power in the Golgari). Gatecrash's Planeswalkers are (The newest version of the white-aligned warrior) and (A red/green who fits in perfectly with the Gruul). Dragon's Maze only has one Planeswalker: Ral Zarek, a red/blue Izzet mage who would rather run the maze himself rather than let Melek do it.Dragon's Maze Player's Guide The homunculus Fblthp (Who only shows up in the art and flavor text of the card ) has also become quite popular, spawning plushies, a Twitter feed, and his own website. = Dragon's Maze = Dragon's Maze features all ten guilds from Ravnica. Beyond just printing new cards for the guilds, Dragon's Maze adds a whole new element to each one, such as adding some offensive creatures to the otherwise spell- centric Izzet League. In the prerelease sealed format, players chose their guild and received a guild pack of the appropriate guild. The guild pack also contained a second \\"secret\\" guild that shared one of the two colors of the chosen guild. Each player that attended the prerelease received the same promotional card, , which could not be played in the sealed deck (as opposed to the prereleases for Return to Ravnica and Gatecrash). The draft format for Dragon's Maze also reverts to the normal format of drafting the three sets in a block in reverse order of their release, in this case Dragon's Maze ‚Äì Gatecrash ‚Äì Return to Ravnica. Booster packs for Dragon's Maze do not contain basic lands. Instead each booster contains either a guildgate, a shock land, or the mythic rare land from Dragon's Maze in the appropriate ratio of their rarities. The Shock lands have the appropriate expansion symbols of Return to Ravnica and Gatecrash, but the Gates are part of Dragon's Maze and have a Dragon's Maze expansion symbol making them part of the set and thus marking the first time cards other than basic lands are printed multiple times within the same block. In limited events, an exceptional rule was set up, which Shock lands in Dragon's Maze boosters are treated as if they are cards from Dragon's Maze during sealed or booster draft. Dragon's Maze features the planeswalker Ral Zarek. Another returning feature of the set is the presence of the Guild champions, all of which are in the rare slot, as opposed to mythic rare. At one point in development, some of the Champions were going to be mythic and much more powerful while others were going to be rare, but it was eventually decided that all the Champions had to be equal in terms of rarity and power.http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/48288088338/i-would-just-like-to- say-that-im-very-happy-that-you The set marks the return of Split Cards, which have two separate effects printed on the same card but with different mana costs, only now in the form of \\"Fuse\\" cards (explained below).  Mechanics  Five new guild mechanics are introduced in both Return to Ravnica and Gatecrash. Each of the ten guild mechanics introduced in the previous sets is also featured in Dragon's Maze. According to Mark Rosewater, each mechanic was designed to go along with the corresponding one from the original Ravnica block. * Overload (Izzet):. Just like the uncontrolled experiments of the Izzet, if its controller pays the more expensive overload cost of a card instead of the normal cost, that spell has its text changed by replacing all instances of \\"target\\" with \\"each\\". This effectively extends the effects of the given spell to any and all other possible legal targets. For example, a spell with overload may read \\"Target creature you control gets +1/+0 and is unblockable until end of turn.\\" Overloading this spell would cause it to affect \\"Each creature you control\\" instead. * Unleash (Rakdos): Embodying the Rakdos ideal of putting on a good show, if a card has Unleash, its controller has the option of having it enter the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter on it. Creatures with Unleash are unable to block if they have a +1/+1 counter on them. * Detain (Azorius): Showing the will of the Azorius to uphold the law before all else, Detain occurs as an effect of a spell or ability, most commonly appearing on triggered abilities that trigger when the creature they're printed on enters the battlefield. While a permanent is detained, it is basically \\"locked-down\\" for a turn, being unable to attack or block(if it is a creature), or have its abilities activated. This effect lasts until the player who caused it begins his or her next turn. * Populate (Selesnya): Used to multiply their \\"one for all\\" guild, whenever a spell or ability tells a player to populate, that player puts a creature token onto the battlefield that is a copy of a creature token that player controls. * Scavenge (Golgari): To utilize the dead (something they do best), when a creature with Scavenge is in the graveyard, its owner may pay its Scavenge cost and upon exiling that creature card from the graveyard, allows him/her to put +1/+1 counters equal to the power of the scavenged creature on target creature on the battlefield.

Together with Leonetto Cappiello, Adolfo Hohenstein, Giovanni Maria Mataloni and Leopoldo Metlicovitz he is considered one of the progenitors of Italian poster design. Biography Marcello Dudovich was born in 1878 in Trieste to an Italian mother and father. His father, Antonio Dudovich, born in Tra√π (Trogir), Dalmatia, was a fervent Italian irredentist who fought alongside Giuseppe Garibaldi during the Third Italian War of Independence, and worked for the insurance company Assicurazioni Generali.https://marcellodudovich.it/portfolio_page/om2/?lang=it https://www.slideshare.net/Generali/the-image-the-generali-group-and-the-art- of-advertising-i-25842219 Marcello attended the prestigious Royal School in Trieste. Upon completing his studies, he began working with his father as a lithographer and illustrator for advertising art, prints and posters. He relocated from Trieste to Milan in 1897 after attending a professional art school. He was recruited as a lithographer by Ricordi, a music publisher, thanks to his father's friendship with the illustrator and cartoonist Leopoldo Metlicovitz, and was given charge over advertisement design. In 1899 he transferred to Bologna, working here for the publisher Edmondo Chappuis, designing billboards, book covers and illustrations for publications such as Italia Ride in 1900 e Fantasio in 1902. Here he met Elisa Bucchi, his future wife. In 1900 he won the \\"Gold Medal\\" at the Paris World Fair. In 1905 Dudovich returned to Milan to rejoin Ricordi. Here, in the next few years, he designed some of his well-known posters, including \\"Mele di Napoli\\" (Apples from Naples) and \\"Borsalino\\". In the 1920s he made several posters for the Milan department store, La Rinascente, and in 1922 he was appointed artistic director of \\"Igap\\". In 1930 he designed a prominent poster for Pirelli. After the Second World War he moved away from the world of commercial art, concentrating instead on his painting. Marcello Dudovich died in Milan from a cerebral hemorrhage on 31 March 1962. Dudovich is celebrated as one of Italy's greatest poster artists. He was inspired by Edward Penfield, by his friend and teacher Adolfo Hohenstein and by Alphonse Mucha. But ultimately his reputation comes from his having developed his own very distinctive and richly colored style.

Both mound sites are part of the Ocmulgee National Monument, a national park and historic district created in 1936 and run by the U.S. National Park Service. Historians and archaeologists have theorized that the site is the location of the main village of the Ichisi encountered by the Hernando de Soto expedition in 1539. Site description The site has two large platform mounds and an associated village area surrounded by a palisade. The original settlement may have been started on a natural levee of the Ocmulgee River, a location which eventually became Mound A. The main village area spreads out to the southeast from this location. This location may have been island-like at the time of its settlement, the only high ground located in a low swampy area with the Ocmulgee River on one side and an oxbow lake on the other. Houses in the village were rectangular wattle and daub structures, some situated on low house mounds, and the palisade was made of upright logs covered in clay. The palisade encircled an area of about and followed the island shape of the raised levee. Outside of the palisade was an encircling ditch, probably water filled at the time of the sites occupation. Mound A is a large mound with a round in diameter and deep depression located in the northwestern quadrant of its summit. This feature is thought to be the remnants of a collapsed earth lodge with a dugout floor and embanked walls. Unlike other Middle Mississippian culture mounds to the northwest, Lamar-style mounds are more rounded in shape as compared to squared-off rectangles. Mound B, completely round in shape, has a feature almost unique in southeastern archaeology in that it has a spiral ramp leading to its summit. This and other evidence has led archaeologists to speculate that the mound was in the process of being enlarged and given a new layer of fill when work was abruptly stopped. Unlike other Mississippian sites, no evidence of a meticulously clean plaza has been found at the site, although the large area between mounds was once theorized to be one. Two large pits were made at the site, one inside the palisade and the other outside its perimeter. These were probably borrow pits left over from mound construction. It is possible the inhabitants used the pits as clean water reservoirs and fish ponds, a use described by the De Soto chroniclers when passing through the area. Lamar culture The Lamar site was inhabited from about 1350 to 1600 CE, during the late prehistoric and early historic period of the area. The style of Mississippian culture pottery found at the site has been used to define this period in the regional chronology, making it the type site for the Lamar culture (also known variously as the Lamar phase and Lamar period). Excavations In 1936 the site was acquired by the United States government and incorporated into the new Ocmulgee National Monument. It was then extensively excavated during the late 1930s as part of the government's Depression era Works Progress Administration archaeology program. The site saw a series of major archaeological excavations starting with one by James A. Ford in 1934, Arthur R. Kelly in 1936, Gordon Willey in 1938, and in 1939-1940 by Jesse Jennings and Charles Fairbanks. To protect the site from the flooding Ocmulgee River a large levee was constructed around it in 1941. In 1996 archaeologist Mark Williams from the University of Georgia and the Lamar Institute did test excavations and site mapping, the first archaeological explorations at the site since 1940. Possible location of Ichisi Proposed de Soto expedition route through Georgia (Hudson 1997). On March 29, 1539, the Hernando de Soto entrada, while winding its way northward after leaving Florida, came upon the province of Ichisi, which may have been part of the larger paramount chiefdom of Ocute. They were greeted, at the first village, by women dressed in white mantles with gifts of corn cakes and wild onions. On March 30 they were ferried across the Ocmulgee River in dugout canoes and met by the paramount chief of the province, a man with only one good eye. They spent several days at the village as the guest of the one-eyed ruler. The chief gave de Soto gifts of food and offered him porters and translators to speed him on to the next chiefdom to the northeast, Ocute, a people who spoke a different language from the Ichisi. Before leaving on April 1, the Spaniards erected a large wooden cross atop one of the village mounds and tried to explain its significance to the villagers. Noted historian and de Soto researcher Charles M. Hudson theorized in the 1980s and 90s, that the de Soto entrada crossed the Ocmulgee River near Macon and that the Lamar Mounds may have been the location of the paramount town of the Ichisi, a view supported by archaeologists who have worked at the site. New archaeological work at a site in rural Telfair County, Georgia near the town of McRae in 2009 called this identification into question and suggested the crossing took place approximately further south. Archaeologists and historians are still debating which of the two sites was actually visited by de Soto and his men. Lamar name The mounds are located on plantation land that was owned by John Basil Lamar. After his death in the Civil War the property remained in the Lamar family and part of the former plantation that includes the mounds was sold to the United States in 1936 as recorded in \\"Lamar Archaeology\\", Mark Williams and Gary Shapiro, University of Alabama Press.

It premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival on 16 February 2011. Plot Karen, a housewife in her late thirties, leaves her troubled marriage and moves into a cheap room in crumbling neighborhood where she tries to start a new life. Unskilled, she is unable to find work. Her troubles only increase when her purse is stolen with all her money, forcing her to beg for money at bus stops and shoplift from grocery stores. Her mother and her husband both try to convince her to give the marriage a second chance, but she would rather be on her own. Karen's new friend Patricia introduces her to a playwright with whom she begins a relationship. Karen is offered a job at a bookstore where she had applied much earlier, but before she can begin work her new boyfriend informs her that he's been offered a job in Argentina and he wants her to join him there. She accepts, and in doing so turns down the job at the bookstore. But before they leave, she realizes that the move would keep her from living her own life as she intended, and she chooses not to go. The film ends with Karen riding on the bus, still uncertain of the future, but content to finally be living on her own terms. As she gets off the bus, another woman gets on, destitute and crying, just as Karen had done at the start of the film.

The term gained wider attention following a panel at the SXSW conference in 2012.

It‚Äôs from London, but it was born digital, on the Internet. The New Aesthetic is a ‚Äútheory object‚Äù and a ‚Äúshareable concept.‚Äù :The New Aesthetic is ‚Äúcollectively intelligent.‚Äù It‚Äôs diffuse, crowdsourcey, and made of many small pieces loosely joined. It is rhizomatic, as the people at Rhizome would likely tell you. It‚Äôs open-sourced, and triumph-of-amateurs. It‚Äôs like its logo, a bright cluster of balloons tied to some huge, dark and lethal weight. Matthew Battles, a contributor to Metalab, a project of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society, gives a definition that makes reference to purported paradigmatic examples: :New Aesthetic is a collaborative attempt to draw a circle around several species of aesthetic activity‚Äîincluding but not limited to drone photography, ubiquitous surveillance, glitch imagery, Streetview photography, 8-bit net nostalgia. Central to the New Aesthetic is a sense that we‚Äôre learning to ‚Äúwave at machines‚Äù‚Äîand that perhaps in their glitchy, buzzy, algorithmic ways, they‚Äôre beginning to wave back in earnest. One of the more substantive contributions to the notion of the New Aesthetic has been through a development of, and linking to, the way in which the digital and the everyday are increasingly interpenetrating each other. Here, the notion of the unrepresentability of computation, as both an infrastructure and an ecology, are significant in understanding the common New Aesthetic tendency towards pixelated graphics and a retro 8-bit form.Berry, D. M., Dartel, M. v., Dieter, M., Kasprzak, M. Muller, N., O'Reilly, R., and Vicente, J. L (2012) New Aesthetic, New Anxieties, Amsterdam: V2, accessed 27/06/2012, http://www.v2.nl/publishing/new-aesthetic-new-anxieties This is related to the idea of an episteme (or ontotheology) identified with relation to computation and computational ways of seeing and doing: computationality. Michael Betancourt has discussed the New Aesthetic in relation to digital automation. The ‚Äònew aesthetic‚Äô provides a reference point for the examination of Karl Marx's discussion of machines in ‚ÄòThe Fragment on Machines.‚Äô :The 'new aesthetic' documents is the shift from earlier considerations of machine labor as an amplifier and extension of human action -- as an augmentation of human labor -- to its replacement by models where the machine does not augment but supplant, in the process apparently removing the human intermediary that is the labor that historically lies between the work of human designer-engineers and fabrication following their plans.Betancourt, Michael. Automated Labor: The 'New Aesthetic' and Immaterial Physicality, CTheory, Theory Beyond the Codes: tbc048, http://ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=717 According to Betancourt, the New Aesthetic documents a shift in production that is different than that described by Marx. Where the machines Marx described were dependent on human control, those identified with the New Aesthetic work to supplant the human element, replacing it with digital automation, effectively removing living labor from the production process. One movement that draws parallels to \\"New Aesthetic\\" is \\"Seapunk\\".

The film earned an estimated $1,225,000 at the US box office in 1951.'The Top Box Office Hits of 1951', Variety, January 2, 1952 The Last Outpost had the distinction of being the most successful film for the prolific B movie company, Pine-Thomas Productions.Dick, Bernard F. (2001). Engulfed: The Death of Paramount Pictures and the Birth of Corporate Hollywood, University Press of Kentucky, p. 33 The film was re-released in 1962 under the title Cavalry Charge. Plot In 1862, Confederate Army Captain Vance Britton (Reagan) and his cavalry force are capturing most of the supplies sent East along the Santa Fe Trail before they are able to reach the Union Army outpost at San Gil, Arizona, where trading post owner Sam McQuade (Ridgely) deals with the Apache Indians. Union Colonel Jeb Britton (Bennett), Vance's brother, is sent West to stop the Confederate raids, unaware that his brother is his adversary. When he arrives with only a small detachment of troops, McQuade tries to persuade Jeb to use the Apaches to subdue the Rebels, but Jeb rejects the idea, certain the Indians would kill settlers as well as Confederate soldiers. That evening McQuade, believing that Jeb rather than Vance is the Britton who was once the fianc√© of McQaude's lonely and unhappy wife Julie (Fleming), tries to embarrass them both socially. McQuade angrily tells Julie that she is still pining for Vance and she leaves him. Vance turns the tables on Jeb‚Äôs attempt to trap the Rebels and humiliates him. Returning to the fort on foot and bootless, Jeb is informed by McQuade that he has persuaded the government to negotiate with the Apaches. Soon afterwards McQuade is attacked and killed by Apaches. Vance finds a letter on McQuade‚Äôs body that a Union officer is on his way from Washington, D.C. to parlay with the Apache chiefs. Vance waylays the officer and takes his place, discovering that Chief Grey Cloud is actually a disgraced former Army general who married an Apache. Gray Cloud knows the real emissary and Britton admits that he is a Confederate officer trying to keep the Apaches out of the war. A group of Apaches is arrested for McQuade's murder. Gray Cloud gives Vance 24 hours to free the prisoners as the price of keeping the Apaches from joining forces with the Union troops. Still posing as a Yankee officer, Vance goes to the jail in San Gil, where the jailed Apaches tell him that McQuade was killed for selling them defective guns and tainted liquor. He encounters Julie, who angrily rejects his explanation that he jilted her because he chose the Confederacy. Before Vance can arrange the escape of the prisoners or seize a shipment of gold coin being sent east by stagecoach, Jeb returns from searching for the Rebels and captures his brother. Vance escapes and reluctantly decides to return to Texas. Grey Cloud, under a flag of truce, comes to San Gil with his warriors and promises to stay out of the white man‚Äôs war if the prisoners are released, but is killed by a civilian. Vance and his command learn of the ensuing Apache attack, and he orders his men to charge the Apaches and save the town. After the battle, Julie returns to the East, promising to reunite with Vance someday. The brothers shake hands before the Confederates ride away. Cast * Ronald Reagan as Capt.

Biography Pavel Pepperstein Pepperstein was born to Irina Pivovarova, an author of children‚Äôs books, and Viktor Pivovarov, a well- known painter. From 1985 to 1987, he studied at The Academy of Fine Arts in Prague. In 1987 he co-founded the experimental group of artists called Inspection Medical Hermeneutics (P.Pepperstein, S. Anufriev, Y.Liederman, V. Fedorov). The ideology of Medical Hermeneutics was the fusion of incompatible descriptive language, from contemporary western philosophy and Orthodox theology, Daoism and Buddhism to the language of psychiatry and pharmacology, which created a completely unique manner of expression. Since 1989 Pepperstein has been an independent artist, writer, critic, art theorist and rap musician. His work is a continuation of the tradition started by the Moscow Conceptual School. During 1994 he was Visiting Professor at the St√§delschule in Frankfurt, Germany. His exhibitions include the 53rd Venice Biennial in 2009, in the Russian Pavilion, where his installation Landscapes of the Future was widely acclaimed and received numerous positive reviews from critics.http://artpulsemagazine.com/venice-biennale-making- worldshttp://johnmcdonald.net.au/2009/53rd-venice- biennale/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sponsored/rbth/6269450/Russian-culture- Focus-on-Russias-art-scene.html Writing about the Venice Biennale in S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk said he found consolation in the work of Pepperstein, which reminds him of William Blake.http://artforum.com/news/week=200928#news23230 In June 2014, Pepperstein was personally invited by the distinguished German curator Kasper K√∂nig to appear at Manifesta 10, the European Biennial of Contemporary Art. In October 2014 Pepperstein was invited to take part in a group exhibition Manifest Intention. Drawing in all its forms at Castello di Rivoli Museo d‚ÄôArte Contemporanea. The exhibition, curated by Beatrice Merz, was entirely dedicated to the leading practitioners of the art of drawing from the last 100 years. Pepperstein‚Äôs work also features prominently in a book on contemporary figurative drawing written by Roger Malbert, a senior curator at Hayward Gallery in London. The book, entitled 'Drawing People' and published by Thames and Hudson in April 2015, focuses on contemporary artists for whom drawing is a primary means of expression and who focus on the human subject. Roger Malbert writes, \\"Word and image flow from the same pen with a facility and grace that appear peculiarly timeless in the work of Pavel Pepperstein. His drawings hark back to a pre-technological age when handwriting was cultivated as the primary expression of the self, and great illustrators such as Saul Steinberg could invoke a multiplicity of styles with a few lines. In Pepperstein's universe political allegory is couched in the symbolic language of Russian Suprematism of the early twentieth century, an avant-garde so far ahead of its time that a century after its manifestation it still appears to foresee a future at which we may never arrive. Paradoxically, for a figurative artist like Pepperstein, with one foot in children's book illustration and the other in political cartoons, it is Malevich's Black Square (1915), the absolute negation of figurative imagery, that heralds the new order. This would be the mystical 'end of history', when all conflicts are resolved, gangsters no longer rule the roost and justice prevails\\".Roger Malbert, 'Drawing People, The Human figure in Contemporary Art', Thames & Hudson 2015. Echoing the attention Malbert pays to word and image in Pepperstein's art, Boris Groys states in After the Big Tsimtsum, \\"Pavel Pepperstein is quite clearly more than just an artist. He is also a poet, writer, critic, curator and theorist. Above all, however, he is a designer of social spaces\\".Quoted in 'The Life & Times of Pavel Pepperstein', by Becky Shirwan, Elephant, Issue 11, Summer 2012. The curator Hans Ulrich Obrist calls Pepperstein \\"one of the most important contemporary artists\\".Hans Ulrich Obrist, Picasso's Resurrection, Das Magazin, 8 April 2017 And the critic Filipa Ramos has said of Pepperstein, ‚ÄúIn his vast body of work, the artist has explored the possibilities of combining linguistics, outlandish experiments, popular narratives, and science fiction in a way that seems to be immune to the ideals and expressive forms of post-perestroika‚Äù.http://www.art-agenda.com/reviews/pavel-pepperstein/ Pepperstein‚Äôs art has been exhibited in museums and galleries around the world, including The Louvre in Paris. His paintings, drawings and installations can be found in the Tretyakov State Gallery in Moscow, the Russian State Museum in St Petersburg, the George Pompidou Centre in Paris, the Deutsche Bank Collection and in many public and private collections both in Russia and abroad. In December 2014, Pepperstein was awarded the Kandinsky Prize, Russia's premier contemporary art award. Pepperstein is a somewhat mythical figure. An intensely private man, he rarely appears in public and has no permanent address or studio, preferring instead an anchoritic lifestyle and nomadic existence. Pepperstein is also a prominent writer of fiction, known for his wild imagination and unique sense of humour. His magnum opus is ¬´The Mythogenic Love of Castes¬ª (Vol. 1, published in 1999, written in collaboration with Sergei Anufriev, Vol. 2, published in 2002, written by Pepperstein alone), a large-scale psychedelic novel in which the Great Patriotic War is shown through the eyes of permanently hallucinating party organizer Vladimir Dunayev (some of the creations that he encounters in his delirium evidently resemble Mary Poppins, Vinnie the Pooh, Baba Yaga and other characters from children books and folk tales). Pepperstein also published several collections of surrealistic fantasy short stories, including critically acclaimed ¬´War Stories¬ª (2006) and ¬´Spring¬ª (2010).

The design was awarded the RAIA Residential Multiple Award in 2002. The project is a medium-density development which articulates many of Kerstin Thompson's architectural ideologies regarding ideas on the \\"interstitial\\" as a mode of thinking around architecture, and a preference for hybrid and complex solutions rather than single expressions. These ideologies resulted in two strong themes, a distinctive entanglement with the idea of context and a creative approach towards dwelling configurations.  Description  The personnel involved in the project include Kerstin Thompson, Michael Archibald and Simone Koch. The design includes eleven dwellings and each one includes a generous roof terrace and flexible options for occupation. The terraces are arrested at two corners by brick skillions, which, along with the use of materials, create a sense of continuity within the design. Running parallel to the rear of the terraces, four dwellings are arranged in two serial lines of extruded three-storey volumes. Large brick faces hover over the street, giving a visual connection to the larger brick forms beyond. The return sides of the radically sloping brick walls reconnect them to the scale of the five intervening terraces. On the lane-way corner, this system is reversed so that the terraces contrast in height to the reversed inclination of the skillion. The project is surrounded at street level by fine-gauge steel fencing which protects small threshold gardens at each dwelling's entry.  Key influences and design approach  Located at the centre of an established residential precinct, this project responds to a variety of neighbouring building types ranging from historic terraces and row houses to converted industrial buildings and post-war housing towers. Napier Street Housing takes the linear disposition of the traditional terrace housing ‚Äì formal rooms at the front, narrow services rooms into the depth of the block, indented side light court and rear pocket garden ‚Äì and reconfigures it vertically. The ground floor includes the garages and secondary bedrooms which are placed around narrow internal light courts. The location of the bedrooms has allowed the architect to elevate the main living area to the first floor, where each dwelling leads out to generous open spaces. In response to the uncertainty of occupation often associated with speculative housing, Thompson has created a floor plan with flexible and innovative internal spatial solutions that encourages a variety of forms of use. In the four detached rear dwellings, Thompson has continued her ongoing examination of appropriate housing models by creating street elevations that act as literal sections of their interior volumes. The change in materials therefore reflects the interior spaces, not only providing contextual engagement but also acting as a public expression of Thompson's ongoing research. The skillions on either side of the building are reminiscent of Alvar Aalto‚Äôs work, an influence on Thompson's design. These \\"bookends\\" not only draw reference with the chronology of the adjoining context but also serve a formal purpose by creating the outline for the built form.

It was designed by local architect Harold Desbrowe- Annear and completed in 1915. The house was designed for the Francis family, who emigrated from England in the late 19th century. The house was named Inglesby after the family estate in England of the same name. Inglesby was at the forefront of modernism in Australia, by using open-planning and enabling views across the entire house due to few interior walls. Desbrowe-Annear also introduced the ability to open up spaces to combine rooms, or to close them off to create multiple separate spaces. Furthermore, the use of plain white walls, a simple rectangular foot print, and reduced ornamentation also constituted the modernist style through the creation of pure and ordered form. The house was demolished in 1964 and a set of apartment blocks have been erected, which hold references to the Francis House through materiality and retaining the name Inglesby. Description Inglesby was a white, two-storey rectangular building influenced by the Californian style architecture of the time, with a large garden buffering the house from the street. The building was structurally supported with a simple timber frame clad with white roughcast blocks. In terms of roofing, Desbrowe-Annear hinted at modernism by using a slightly pitched a tiled roof, but ensuring the roof appeared flat from the street. Moreover, each window incorporated small wooden eyelash like brackets, communicated with the wooden pergola, which divided the front garden. This use of exposed wood aimed to accentuate the importance of use of Australian timber and materials. The porch in front of the building is a key feature of the house. This square enclosed space was a direct translation of Irving Gill‚Äôs style of modernism, through the use of uncomplicated openings, symmetry and simplicity. The porch dominated the fa√ßade and was a pioneering feature in contemporary Australian architecture due to the simplicity, elegance and proportionality of its white walls. Through Inglesby, Desbrowe- Annear began to question the role of ornamentation, proving that a simple shape can be just as bold and eye catching. Corner shot The porch led into a hallway which divided the building and acted as a central spine and provided internal axial circulation and contained a wooden staircase which provided access to the bedrooms and bathrooms. The living space consisted of a dining and living room opening off the hall. Sliding doors allowed this space to be split into two separate rooms or opened into one large space which inhabited the entire front of the house. There were few interior walls in the Francis house, which incorporated the idea of open plan living. Furthermore, Inglesby had low ceilings with wide hallways and rooms, which emphasised the feeling of spaciousness and width, as each space sprawled across the wooden floors. Desbrowe-Annear also introduced the idea of built-in furniture and robes to Australian architecture. This meant less furniture was needed, removing clutter from the room and emphasising the extensive open spaces. Influences =Irving J. Gill= Lewis Court perspective The design of Inglesby arrived through the influence of American architect Irving Gill‚Äôs forms. Irving J. Gill‚Äôs design concepts were centred on the attributes of simplicity, honesty and democracy. Many of Gill‚Äôs projects were in Southern California and were minimalist in terms of ornamentation and form. They were often simple boxes in plan, characterised by flat or low pitched roofs. Their entrances were commonly placed at the end of a long pergola or an extended arcade. Spaces were also designed with the intention of dual or multiple functions. A primary example of this style is the Lewis Court Cottage, which had a large scale pergola acting as an entrance, living-dining room and outdoor porch. To tie everything together, a garden surrounded the porch and entrance, providing the formalities of a front yard. =M.H. Baillie Scott= M.H. Baillie Scott planDesbrowe-Annear took inspiration from the designs of English architect M.H. Baillie Scott. Baillie Scott was known for his residential designs, which incorporated the idea of open planning with a large living area being the heart of the house in terms of location and spatial volume. It served multiple functions of living and dining with access to the office, workroom and lavatory as well. All of these rooms were usually linked through large sliding doors, allowing each space to be opened or closed off. Baillie Scott states. ‚ÄúIn making the plan for a house it will be necessary to banish from one‚Äôs mind the conception of its interior as a mere group of isolated compartments, and to think of it rather as a central room surrounded by subordinated ones, some of which may in many cases form either recesses in the central apartment or communicate with it either by folding or sliding doors.‚Äù References External links * https://web.archive.org/web/20120321185037/http://www.skhs.org.au/SKHSbuildings/45.htm * http://www.pictureaustralia.org/apps/pictureaustralia?action=PASearch&mode;=subject&complete1;=true&attribute1;=subject&term1;=Inglesby Category:Houses in Melbourne Category:Modernist architecture in Australia ","title":"Inglesby"},{"id":"35492884","text":"The dredge valve is a component of a Cutter Suction Dredge or a Trailing Suction Hopper Dredger that is used control the flow of water and sand in the suction and discharge pipes of one of these types of dredgers.Dredge Valve CAD Design There are 3 cases when this vertical valve can block or reduce the mixture flow of water and sand by lowering its gate: * 1.from the hopper of the TSHD to the discharge pipe. * 2.from the dredge cutter head of the CSD to the ship * 3.from the dredge drag head of the TSHD to the ship The dredge valve‚Äôs gate is hydraulically control and it has raised a lot of challenges because of maintaining it clean.

The film was released in Colombia on 7 October 2011 and follows a squad of soldiers that are sent to investigate a mountain military base. After a secret military base ceases all communications, an anti-guerrilla commando unit is sent to the mountainous location to discover what exactly happened. The squad expects to discover that the base was attacked and taken over by guerrilla units, but instead find only a lone woman (Daniela Catz) wrapped in chains. Plot A team of anti-guerilla commandos led by an experienced sergeant and commanded by a green lieutenant are sent to secure the approach to a mountain base amid towering radio masts. When they are in position they are told to wait for their backup which has been delayed by enemy action en route. One of the soldiers, Arango, is impatient to get into the base and after arguing with the lieutenant, makes a dash up the stairs to the base. The radio operator, Parra, tries to stop him, but steps on a mine which shatters his leg and destroys the primary radio. The sergeant insists they must now enter the base to use the medical facilities in order to save the critically injured Parra. Inside the base the squad finds only a few bodies but bloodstains and destroyed rooms everywhere. The base radios have been destroyed, and the squad personal radios are only short range, so they cannot contact their backup. The sergeant discovers that the base supplies are untouched, indicating that this was not a guerrilla raid. Exploring the base, their local guide (Fiquitiva, nicknamed \\"Indian\\") discovers a room filled with fetishes and prayers scrawled on the walls. He calls the others, but is mocked for his superstition. Later, he returns and discovers that the wall of the room has been recently built and something is trapped behind it. The lieutenant order the wall broken down, and they find, trapped inside, a bound woman who cannot, or will not, talk to them. Arango, whose brother was stationed on the base, tries to question her but gets nowhere. The sergeant begins beating her but is stopped by the lieutenant. The lieutenant calls for the medic and puts one of the other soldiers, Ponce, on guard with orders that no-one is to see the prisoner without permission. Ponce starts to offer the woman some food, but is dragged away by the medic, who accuses Ponce of being \\"just like the rest\\" and that he is disgusted by them all. The squad corporal, Cortez, discovers a bundle of papers under a body and begins to read them as night falls. Ponce, guarding the prisoner, is bullied into leaving by the sergeant, who then enters the room with the prisoner. Reading the papers Cortez discovers that the woman was picked up on suspicion of being a guerilla spy and interrogated, but refused to talk. At the same time she was taken prisoner, one of the base soldiers became ill and insisted the woman had placed a curse upon him. The base soldiers became increasingly convinced the woman was a witch and eventually rioted, attempting to cut out her tongue. The log ends without explaining what happens next, only that \\"the captain had completely lost control of the men\\", at least one of whom had killed another soldier, and the final scrawled words in the log insist that they \\"must kill the witch\\". Ponce has a flashback dream to hazy memories of an event before the start of the mission, but is suddenly awoken by shouting from his radio to return to the guard post. Inside, they discover that the sergeant has been killed and the woman has escaped. They spread out looking for her and \\"Indian\\" falls down a gully, landing in a mass grave of base soldiers. Indian confronts the lieutenant, accusing him of bringing doom on them all by releasing the \\"witch\\". An argument between Arango and Parra's best friend is interrupted when the perimeter noisemakers are tripped at one of the lookout points. The mist means that they cannot see anything, but corporal Cortez defies the lieutenant to lead the men out to attempt to kill the \\"guerrilla bitch\\". Out in the mist, the men begin shooting at fast moving shapes that whip past them, but only succeed in shooting Arango in the crossfire, killing him. The lieutenant, furious at Arango's death and the squad for disobeying his orders, attempts to relieve Parra's friend of his weapon, but is stopped by the corporal, who accuses him of knowing about the witch from the logbook all along. The lieutenant denies knowing anything and arguing that it is Cortez's fault for leading the men out into the mist, but the men side with the corporal and tie up the lieutenant in the radio room. Indian, who has been furiously scratching since falling in the pit, goes to the medic and demands treatment because he has caught \\"the plague\\" from the dead bodies. The medic throws him out, distraught because Parra has gangrene and is dying. Ponce tries to talk to Cortez insisting the situation has gone well beyond their control, but the corporal insists he will get all of them out safe. Indian steals gasoline from the base generator to burn the corpse pit, then strips off his clothes. Disgusted, the corporal kicks him back toward the pit then locks him out of the base. In a last effort to save his life, the remaining team try to amputate Parra's leg, but he dies shortly after the operation. Angry, and with no reason to remain with his patient, the medic prepares to leave. The corporal refuses to let him, as whoever killed the sergeant is still out there. In a rage, the medic reveals that he killed the sergeant rather than let him rape and murder another woman, referencing the events from Ponce's flashback. In retaliation, Cortez beats the medic to death in front of the horrified Ponce. A scream from outside prompts Ponce and Parra's friend to try and rescue Indian, but Indian is trying to cut off his \\"contaminated\\" skin and stabs Parra's friend to death when found (Indian is not seen again after this). Ponce tries to persuade Cortez to leave, but the corporal is now totally insane and Ponce is forced to kill him in self-defense. Ponce climbs slowly down the mountain, suffering flashbacks to the events before the mission - the massacre of an entire village of guerrilla sympathisers. He arrives at the point where the film started in a disconnected daze, when the \\"witch\\" appears behind him and screams.

Geeks of Doom wrote \\"For some, The Squad will impress with its tense, psychological drama. For others, it will fail to deliver on its interesting premise. It‚Äôs a polished, well-crafted thriller, but it just isn‚Äôt all that thrilling to me.

It is considered a lost film.Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper, Australian Film 1900‚Äì1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production, Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1998, p 37 Plot The film was billed as \\"a story of the Australian bush, based on the incidents of the easy miner settlements.\\" The home of Wm Collins, a squatter on the Lachlan, was shown, together with the return Fred, who had won his V.C. in the recent Boer war. Fred was secretly loved by Mary Campbell, but lost his heart to the shepherd's pretty daughter to whom he presented his dog Ruby. Bill Doyle, a stockman, was also infatuated with this girl and swore that if he couldn't have her Fred Collins wouldn't. Through Bill's actions, Fred was sent away from home because of his alleged unfaithfulness to Mary Cameron, but was brought back when the latter declared that he had never made love to her. Young Cameron was killed by Doyle on the journey and the latter left Fred's riding whip under the body so that the crime might be fixed upon him. Fred, in due course was arrested and tried, but at this critical moment a sundowner who has witnessed the murder turned up and gave evidence, at the same time producing a handkerchief bearing the name of Doyle. Fred was released and married and married the shepherd's daughter while Doyle went to the scaffold. The sundowner, though offered a home with the happy young couple, could not remains in conventional quarters so responded again to the call of the bush. It was divided into the following chapters: *the squatter's son *a welcome home *the shepherd's daughter *Bosun, the dog hero *attacked by blacks *the last cartridge *a foul revenge *wrongly accused *a sundowner to the rescue *great court scene.

The name stands for Toru≈Ñ, Jerzy Borkowski, Wojciech Skaba, Floating Point. The compiler was released in Poland in 1986. Source code compilation enables substantial (20+ ) speed up of execution of programs that are normally interpreted. The acceleration results mostly from the utilization of compiler's own floating point arithmetic library and graphics library that replace the ZX Spectrum built-in routines. In a 1992 independent survey, ToBoS-FP was named the most popular of all known BASIC compilers for the ZX Spectrum. It is still referred to as one of the best BASIC compiler for ZX Spectrum.  Background  ZX Spectrum is factory equipped with a Sinclair BASIC editor and interpreter that enables immediate program execution without a compilation pass and not consuming memory for the compiled code. This comes, however, at the price of execution speed. A number of integer and floating point compilers have been released since (e.g.: HiSoft Basic , HiSoft Colt , Softek IS/FP , MCoder , ZIP Compiler , Boriel ZX Basic , Blast ). Unfortunately, the Sinclair BASIC enables programming constructs that are hard or even impossible to be compiled (e.g.: GO TO line number which is an expression calculated at runtime). Thus compatibility between the interpreter and a compiler is an issue.  Development  The compiler was written in Z80 assembler. There are two main sources of compiled code execution acceleration: * Conversion of the source code into direct threaded code that frees the processor from [repeatedly] translating the BASIC instructions into program calls * Application of compiler's own time critical subroutine calls, especially those dealing with floating point arithmetic and graphics functions In order to achieve a substantial speed up, a shorter floating point number format has been applied, one that is close to single precision IEEE 754-1985, consisting of 1-byte exponent and 3-byte fraction (effectively 7 decimal digits precision). The original Sinclair BASIC utilizes 1-byte exponent and 4-byte fraction. All floating point arithmetic routines have been rewritten, including basic operations like addition, multiplication, division and functions like square root, logarithm, exponent. A unique algorithm has been developed for the calculation of trigonometric functions. Line drawing, circle drawing and other graphics functions have also been written.  Releases  Successful compilation The most popular version of ToBoS-FP (ver. 2.0) was released on a compact cassette in May 1986 in Poland. After loading to the memory, the compiler could be invoked with USR 53100. Earlier non-stable versions, assigned 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and invoked with USR 53500, were available in limited extent. In June 1987 an improved version named ToBoS-DYD (Tadeusz Golonka co-authored) was released. It was distributed on a 5 1‚ÅÑ4-inch floppy disk and adapted for the Elwro 800 Junior clone of ZX Spectrum. Compared to ver. 2.0, some functions were further optimized and Elwro 800 Junior extensions added.  Reception  Though some 2000 copies of ToBoS-FP have been sold in Poland, it spread worldwide mostly free of charge. As being released when general interest in ZX Spectrum started to decline, it came too late for the market. ToBoS-FP gained most of its popularity in Poland and other East European countries, where ZX Spectrum and its clones were in common use until the mid 1990s. Its ability to expedite games written in Sinclar BASIC was especially appreciated.

It resulted in 13 casualties and destroyed the historic center of the city, with damage estimated at $8 million (about $111 million in 2017).  Earthquake  Although no foreshocks were reported felt before the mainshock, a pressure gauge recording card at the local waterworks showed disturbances beginning at 3:27 a.m., which were likely caused by foreshocks. At 6:44 a.m. the mainshock occurred which lasted 19 seconds. The epicenter of the earthquake was located in the sea off the coast of Santa Barbara, in the Santa Barbara Channel. The fault on which it occurred appears to have been an extension of the Mesa fault or the Santa Ynez system. The earthquake was felt from Paso Robles (San Luis Obispo County) to the north to Santa Ana (Orange County) to the south and to Mojave (Kern County) to the east. = Damage = Major damage occurred in the city of Santa Barbara and along the coast, as well as north of Santa Ynez Mountains, including Santa Ynez and Santa Maria valleys. Mission Santa Barbara damaged by the earthquake Though thirteen people died, it may have been far worse without the actions of three heroes, who shut off the town gas and electricity preventing a catastrophic fire. Most homes survived the earthquake in relatively good condition, although nearly every chimney in the city crumbled. The downtown of Santa Barbara was destroyed. Only a few buildings along State Street, the main commercial street, remained standing after the earthquake. The City Cab building and The Californian and Arlington garages, all large and fully occupied parking structures, collapsed full with cars. Many other vehicles were crushed in the downtown area. At least one death resulted when a driver near the San Marcos building was crushed as walls of buildings fell onto cars parked there. In the business district, an area of about 36 blocks, only a few structures were not substantially damaged, and many had to be completely demolished and rebuilt. The facade of the church of the Mission Santa Barbara was severely damaged and lost its statues. Many important buildings, including hotels, offices, and the Potter Theater, were lost. The courthouse, jail, library, schools, and churches were among the buildings sustaining serious damage. Concrete curbs buckled in almost every block in Santa Barbara. Pavement on the boulevard along the beach was displaced by about , but the pavement in the downtown generally was not damaged. The earthen Sheffield Dam had been built near the city in 1917. It was long and high and held 30 million US gallons (114 million liters) of water. The soil under the dam liquefied during the earthquake and the dam collapsed. This was the only dam to fail during an earthquake in the US until the Lower San Fernando Dam failed in 1971. When it burst, a wall of water swept between Voluntario and Alisos Streets destroying trees, cars, three houses and flooding the lower part of town to a depth of . The Andalucia Building, Spanish Colonial Revival style The Southern Pacific Company Railroad tracks were damaged in several places between Ventura and Gaviota. In particular, a portion between Naples and Santa Barbara was badly damaged and displaced. Seaside bluffs fell into the ocean, and a slight tsunami was noted by offshore ships. The town was completely cut off from telephone and telegraph, and news from the outside world arrived by shortwave radio. The absence of post-earthquake fire permitted scientists to study earthquake damage to various types of construction. The American Legion and the Naval Reserves from the Naval Reserve Center Santa Barbara helped provide order amidst the chaos and manned posts and provided patrols throughout the town to inhibit looting of the damaged businesses and homes. Additional fire and police personnel arrived from as far as Los Angeles to assist the sailors and soldiers in maintaining order. = Aftershocks = Three strong aftershocks occurred in the next few hours, though none causing any additional damage, with events occurring at 8:08, 10:45, and 10:57 am, and many smaller shocks continued throughout the day. An aftershock on July 3 caused additional cracked walls and damaged chimneys.  Aftermath  Since the downtown of Santa Barbara suffered irreparable damage, there was a large- scale construction effort in 1925 and 1926 aimed at removing or repairing damaged structures and constructing new buildings. This development completely altered the character of the city center. Before the earthquake, a considerable part of the center was built in the Moorish Revival style. After the earthquake, the decision was made to rebuild it in the Spanish Colonial Revival style. This effort was undertaken by the Santa Barbara Community Arts Association, which was founded in the beginning of the 1920s and viewed the earthquake as the opportunity to rebuild the city center in the unified architectural style. Many architects were invited to design the building facades, among them James Osborne Craig, George Washington Smith, Carleton Winslow, Bertram Goodhue, and Winsor Soule. Lionel Pries spent a year in Santa Barbara. As a result, many buildings later listed on National Register of Historic Places were designed in the late 1920s, among them the Santa Barbara County Courthouse and the front of the Andalucia Building. Building codes in Santa Barbara were made more stringent after the earthquake demonstrated that traditional construction techniques of unreinforced concrete, brick, and masonry were unsafe and unlikely to survive strong temblors.

They requested the Archbishop of Bombay to assign a permanent priest. The first priest, Fr. Victor, was there for only a short while. In 1883, Fr. Peter S.J. became the parish priest. He felt that there should be a school where the children could get an education. So the Archbishop of Bombay requested the railway authority to construct a school. The school was started in 1881, but it was not recognized until 1888. It was run by the Jesuits from 1 October 1888 to 1915 as a primary school, initially for the children of railway personnel, but in 1897 it was opened to all local people. In 1902, there were only twelve students in five classes with one teacher. Due to the small number of students, the railway grant-in-aid was cut off on 9 May 1903. During the first twelve years, the number of students never increased beyond thirty. In January 1889, a railway bungalow was given for the use of the school and a grant-in-aid of Rs. 20 was approved. On 8 March 1911, railway authorities asked the school management to vacate the bungalow that was given for school use, as the railway department needed it for its own use. The parish provided a building which opened as a school on 23 May 1911. In 1915, local clergy took over the running of the parish. The school again started receiving financial assistance from the railway on 29 April 1916. The education department recognized it on 28 July 1917. The number of students studying at that time was seventy-seven in seven classes. Slowly growth in enrollment reached ninety-nine in 1930. In 1934, electric fans were installed offering some relief in the summers. In this year, the Sindh Mission was separated from Bombay Archdiocese. In 1935, a bus was sanctioned. In 1940, the management was handed over to the Franciscan Missionaries of Christ the King. Sr. Lucy was appointed as the school's principal. The school prepared students for the Cambridge O level examinations only and there were 109 students. In 1949, the number rose to 252 students and 12 teachers were on the staff. In 1942, a boarding option for girls was established. Sr. Lucy was principal followed by Sr. Clare in 1945. The school expanded to the matriculation level in 1950. That year, the principal saw the need for a primary Urdu school and on 13 October 1953 it came into existence. A boarding option was also started for boys. In 1960, the management was handed to the Franciscan priests. In the early 1960s, Fr. John Baptist Todd took over as the principal. In 1963, a science laboratory was built. In 1970, Sr. Flavia FMCK was handed over the charge of the school. In 1972, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, the Prime Minister of Pakistan, nationalized many private educational institutions including St. Mary's. The government returned the school to its original owners in 1990.UCANews 13 February 1990. Sr. Flavia returned as principal. But the condition of the school was terrible ‚Äì it had been stripped and damaged. It was almost completely destroyed, both the building and academically. =Recent events= Sr. Rosey YacoobThe Express Tribune 21 December 2011 took over as principal in 1992. There were 1300 students at the time. With the support of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Hyderabad and Catholic Board of Education, the foundation stone of the new school building was laid in 1997 and the opening ceremony was performed in October 1998. The newly constructed classrooms proved to be insufficient due to the increase in the number of students. Realizing the need for more classrooms, the foundation stone for a new wing was laid in 2000. On the first floor there are five classrooms and a conference room, while there is an auditorium on the second floor. In April 2006, the convener of the standing committee on minorities of the National Assembly said that repair work on the damaged classrooms of the school would be started within a few days.Dawn 27 April 2006 In 2010, the sisters of the School organized teams of volunteers to provide cooked food and water for hundreds of people affected by the floods in Sindh province.Catholic News Agency September 5, 2010 See also * Christianity in Pakistan * Education in Pakistan * List of boarding schools * List of educational institutions in Sukkur References Category:1881 establishments in India Category:2nd- millennium establishments in Pakistan Category:Boarding schools in Pakistan Category:Co-educational boarding schools Category:Educational institutions established in 1881 Category:Franciscan high schools Category:Jesuit secondary schools Category:Catholic boarding schools Category:Catholic elementary and primary schools Category:Catholic secondary schools in Pakistan Category:Schools in Sindh Category:Sukkur Category:Pakistani school stubs Category:Catholic Church in Pakistan ","title":"St. Mary's High School, Sukkur"},{"id":"35493493","text":"The 1945 Victorian state election was held in the Australian state of Victoria on Saturday 10 November 1945 to elect 65 members of the state's Legislative Assembly.

Eligible were all Polish military wounded or injured after November 1, 1918 or before that date, provided that the wound or injury had taken place while serving in the Polish Legions, 1st, 2nd or 3rd Polish Corps in Russia, Polish Army in France or in another Polish military formation recognized by the Republic. It was chronologically the second military honour of independent Poland, after the Order Virtuti Militari and before the Cross of Valour, which would be established a month later.  Description  The decoration had the form of a blue ribbon bar with two narrow horizontal black stripes (the colours of Virtuti Militari). Each wound or injury was denoted by a five-pointed silver star on the ribbon. Up to three stars were worn on a single ribbon; if the number exceeded three, the remaining stars were placed on a second ribbon bar, worn above the first one. The ribbon bar was 1.5 ‚Äì 1.8 cm high and 4 ‚Äì 7 cm wide, depending on the number of stars. All wounds or injuries sustained in the same action counted as one. The badge was worn centrally above the upper left pocket of the tunic, above the first row of recipient's orders and medals or of their ribbon bars.  World War II  The conferment and wearing of the decoration continued in the Polish Armed Forces in the West. The manner of wearing was slightly adjusted, so if a recipient had more than three stars, all were worn on a single, extended bar. Gen. Zygmunt Bohusz-Szyszko proudly wore the badge with six, and Gen. W≈Çadys≈Çaw Anders with as many as eight stars. The badge continued to be worn also in the 1st and 2nd Polish Army in the Soviet Union. The decoration was worn by members of the Polish resistance in the occupied country and by soldiers during the Warsaw Uprising when conditions and security reasons allowed that.  After World War II Military Decoration for Wounds and Injuries ‚Äì 1 wound (2012) After the war the decoration was still worn by combatants, yet the tradition of wearing it began gradually to disappear, although it was never officially forbidden. An attempt to extend awarding to Polish servicemen and women wounded or injured while on an overseas mission (especially in Afghanistan and Iraq) was first made in the Polish Parliament in 2007 but failed then. Eventually, the badge for wounds during missions, named officially the Military Decoration for Wounds and Injuries (Wojskowa odznaka Za Rany i Kontuzje), was established as part of an Act on Military Veterans of August 19, 2011 and by Executive Order of March 15, 2012. The new badge has the same form as the original one, but the ribbon has been altered to dark blue with two horizontal crimson stripes (the colours of the Order of the Military Cross).

Cohen grew the Hudson News into the world's largest airport newsstand retailer from a single location he opened in LaGuardia Airport in 1987. The Hudson News chain is now part of the larger Hudson Group retailer. There are approximately 600 Hudson News locations throughout the United States, as of 2012. Most are located in transportation hubs, including a 1,000-square-foot store in Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan. Biography =Early life= Cohen was born in Bayonne, New Jersey, to Isaac and Lillian Goodman Cohen on May 26, 1925. His father had previously run a newspaper delivery route and newsstand in Brooklyn, New York. In the early 1920s, Isaac Cohen founded a newspaper distributor, the Bayonne News Company. Robert Cohen earned his bachelor's degree from New York University (NYU) in 1947. Cohen played on the NYU Violets basketball team in college and his teammates included Dolph Schayes. In 1947, the same year that he earned his bachelor's degree, Cohen married his wife, the former Harriet Brandwein. =Newspaper and magazine distributorship= Cohen took control of his father's newspaper and magazine distribution company, the Hudson County News Company, shortly after graduation from NYU. Cohen focused much of his career (prior to founding Hudson News) on the expansion of his newspaper distribution business, Hudson County News Company, into one of the largest of its kind in the United States. He served as president of Hudson County News Company. By the 1970s and 1980s, Cohen had grown the business into one of the largest magazine distributorships and wholesalers in the United States, focusing on the Boston and New York City metropolitan areas. Cohen found himself in legal trouble for business practices during the early 1980s. In 1981, Cohen pleaded guilty in federal court to paying Newspaper and Mail Deliverers Union officials $37,000 in exchange for favorable treatment in dealings between the union and his companies. He was fined $150,000 as part of the guilty plea. Cohen acquired the Metropolitan News Company, the regional distributor of The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal in 1985 in a partnership with The New York Times. Cohen also acquired Newark Newsdealers which, again, was part of a partnership with The New York Times Company. Robert Cohen sold his interest of the distributorship and his companies to the New York Times Company in 1994. Cohen owned Worldwide Media Service Inc., which is the largest newsstand distributor of American magazines outside of the United States, from 1985 until 2003. =Hudson News= A Hudson News store. During the mid-1970s, Robert Cohen's Hudson County News Company acquired a bankrupt newsstand at Newark International Airport, which marked his entrance into the retail sector. The newsstand had purchased magazines from Cohen's Hudson County News Company before it went into bankruptcy. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates Newark International Airport and other transit hubs in the New York City area, asked Cohen to take control of the airport newsstand when it closed. At the time of the purchase in the 1970s, airport newsstands were described as very small, usually carrying only a limited selection of newspapers, magazines and other periodicals. Cohen envisioned a larger, more modern, well lit news stores to replace the tiny, dim newsstands and kiosks. In 1987, Cohen opened the first Hudson News store in LaGuardia Airport in New York City. Hudson News stores featured a wide selection of hundreds of domestic and foreign publications, whose covers were fully displayed, allowing customers to easily browse the selection. The stores featured bright, inviting lighting and wide isles, in contrast to other, cramped airport newsstands. Cohen called the layout for his new Hudson News store a \\"new-concept newsstand.\\" The La Guardia location became the model for future Hudson News locations. Robert Cohen's son, James Cohen, succeeded his father as the president of the Hudson Group, which operates Hudson News. In 2008, Robert Cohen sold his majority stake in Hudson News to Dufry of Switzerland, one of the largest operators of duty-free stores in the world. =Personal life= Outside of business, Cohen took a keen interest in racehorses. His best known horse, Hudson County, finished second in the Kentucky Derby in 1974, just behind race winner, Cannonade. Cohen had paid $6,700 for Hudson County before the Derby. Robert Cohen died at the age of 86 at his home in Palm Beach, Florida, on February 1, 2012, of progressive supranuclear palsy, a neurological disorder. He was survived by his wife, Harriet; son, James; six grandchildren; and his sister, Rosalind Stone. He was predeceased by two children, gossip columnist Claudia Cohen and Michael Cohen, who died in 1997. A memorial service was held at the Bergen Performing Arts Center in Englewood, New Jersey, where he and his family were longtime residents.

India has a High Commission in Victoria while Seychelles maintains a High Commission in New Delhi. History Diplomatic ties between India and Seychelles have existed since Seychelles gained independence in 1976. A resident high commissioner of India has been in Victoria since 1987 while Seychelles opened its resident mission in New Delhi in 2008. Relations between the two countries have been warm and cordial with regular high level exchange visits between the countries. From India, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and Presidents R Venkataraman and Pratibha Patil have visited the Seychelles, while Presidents France Albert Rene, James Alix Michel and Danny Faure of Seychelles have paid state visits to India. India and Seychelles have broad based relations that cover a host of sectors including defence, culture, trade and technical cooperation. According to the Ministry of External Affairs of the Government of India, relations between India and Seychelles have been characterised by \\"close friendship, understanding and cooperation\\", while Seychelles has described itself as a \\"rock of dependability for India in the Indian Ocean region‚Äù.  Economic Relations  Seychelles President James Michel hands with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi Trade between India and Seychelles amounted to only US$40 million in 2010-11 with the balance of trade heavily in India's favour. Tourism, fishing, petroleum exploration, communications and IT, computer education and pharmaceuticals have been identified as areas of economic cooperation between the two countries. India and Seychelles signed a bilateral investment promotion agreement in 2010 and in 2012, during President Pratibha Patil's visit to Seychelles, India extended it a $50-million line of credit and a grant of $25-million.

Defence Cooperation  Adm Robin K Dhowan and Seychelles President James Michel at a ceremony to transfer from the Indian Navy to the Seychelles Coast Guard, 7 November 2014. India and Seychelles have a close defence ties. Seychelles is of strategic importance to India as it lies close to global lanes of shipping and commerce and is an important base in the fight against seaborne terrorism and piracy in the Indian Ocean Region. In June 1986, the Indian Navy deployed the at the Seychelles Port of Victoria to abort an attempted coup against President Rene by Defence Minister Berlouis in what was called Operation Flowers are Blooming. India helped avert a further attempted coup by Berlouis in September 1986, when Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi lent President Ren√© his plane so that he could fly back from an international meeting in Harare to the Seychelles. President Ren√© reportedly took shelter in the resident of the Indian High Commissioner in Male. In 2009, India acted upon a request of the Seychelles and dispatched naval ships to patrol the exclusive economic zone of Seychelles and to guard it against piracy. India has provided Seychelles with monetary support and equipment such as Dornier Do 228s and Chetak helicopters for meeting its defence needs besides deputing officers from the Indian armed forces in Seychelles and helping in capacity building of the Seychelles' armed forces. Various Indian Navy ships have visited Seychelles as part of their anti-piracy deployment and protection of Seychelles EEZ, including in February 2005, in March 2011, from 4 to 6 June 2011 and from 17 to 19 June, 2011 and , which visited Port Victoria on 7 November 2011 and conducted hydrographic survey of Aldabra. The Seychelles government has leased the Assumption Island to the Indian Navy to build an overseas base of operations there. The Indian Army is helping to renovate the airfield while the navy has taken permission from the Seychelles government to make a new deep sea port by dregging sand for the same instead of using the ruined, old jetty which is already present. The residents of the island were relocated to another island by the help of Indian Government. Seychelles maritime security advisor is also an Indian naval officer. In June 2018, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that India was extending Seychelles a USD$100 million credit to develop its defence capabilities.  Technical Cooperation  India has been working on human resource development and capacity building with the Government of Seychelles under the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation Programme since the early 1980s. India is a medical tourism destination for the Seychellois and the Government of Seychelles has tied up with MIOT Hospitals and Madras Medical Mission in Chennai for providing healthcare to its citizens. The two nations have also been working together in the areas of environment protection and renewable energy and India is to set up a solar power cluster in Seychelles.

Gaelic football In August 2008 Harkin emigrated to Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates to take up a teaching position at Sharjah English School. She flew back the following month to play for Derry in their All-Ireland Junior Ladies' Football Championship final defeat to London at Croke Park. Harkin had played her club football with Doire Colmcille CLG. Harkin had represented Ulster in inter‚Äìprovincial competition during 2005. She won an Ulster All Star award. Association football Harkin played club soccer with Institute, and in November 2006 was called into the Northern Ireland team for a UEFA Women's Euro 2009 pre‚Äìqualifier tournament in Turkey. Harkin's debut for the Irish team came against the host nation. In summer 2007 Harkin played semi‚Äìprofessional football in Iceland, scoring twice in a total of 12 games for Keflav√≠k. Harkin was unfortunate to score an own goal as Northern Ireland crashed 4‚Äì0 to England at Gillingham in March 2007. She was listed as a Drumahoe YMCA player, but also played some games for Crewe Alexandra Ladies in the English FA Women's Premier League Northern Division during 2006‚Äì07 and 2007‚Äì08. In March 2008 Harkin overcame an ankle injury to play the return fixture against England at Mourneview Park, described as the biggest game of her career. National team coach Alfie Wylie said of Harkin: \\"Una has worked very hard and is fully committed to the cause. She is a powerful centre half who likes to go and win the ball and competes for everything; she is strong in the air and in the tackle and gives us a lot of strength in defence.\\" An improved defensive display saw Ireland restrict their opponents to a 2‚Äì0 win. When Harkin departed to Sharjah in 2008, she had been playing for the women's section of Linfield. She had already left by the time of their IFA Women's Challenge Cup final defeat to Glentoran Belfast United.

Life Kirkwood was born near Dunbar. In May 1674 he was acting as tutor (\\"governour\\") to Lord Bruce at Glasgow College, where he lodged for some time with Gilbert Burnet. In the same year he was offered by Sir Robert Milne of Barntoun, provost of Linlithgow, the mastership of the school there, and eventually accepted in 1675. After 15 years, he quarrelled with the magistrates, was dismissed, and litigation ensued. Kirkwood got the better of his employers, who were mulcted in damages to the extent of four thousand merks for forcibly ejecting him and his wife ‚Äî a Dutch lady, Goletine van Beest ‚Äî from their house, and throwing his books and papers and Mrs. Kirkwood's furniture into the street. Kirkwood left Linlithgow and went, in March 1690, to Edinburgh, where he lived for a year without employment. He then started a school for gentlemen's sons. He states that he later refused the professorship of humanity in the University of St Andrews, a call to Duns, another call to be professor of Greek and Latin at Jamestown, Virginia, the mastership of the free school at Kimbolton, and of a free school in Ireland. He also states that he was invited to return to Linlithgow school. Subsequently Kirkwood became, on the invitation of the Countess of Roxburgh, master of the school at Kelso. Here he was again involved in serious difficulties. Kirkwood died before 1720, probably at Kelso. Grammatical works In John Penney's History of Linlithgowshire and George Chalmers's Life of Ruddiman, Kirkwood is spoken of as the leading grammarian of his day. At the suggestion of Lord Stair, president of the court of session, he was consulted by the commissioners for colleges and schools as to the best Latin grammar to be used in Scotland. He pointed out the defects of Despauter, and was requested to edit Despauter's grammar. In 1695 he produced Grammatica Despauteriana, cum nova novi generis Glossa: cui subjunguntur singula prim√¶ Partis Exempla Vernacule Reddita. It was dedicated to the commissioners of schools and colleges, and secured the privy council's privilege for 19 years. A second edition appeared in 1700, a third in 1711, and a fourth in 1720, all published in Edinburgh. The book was superseded by Thomas Ruddiman's Rudiments (1714). Kirkwood also wrote: * Grammatica facilis, seu nova et artificiosa methodus docendi Linguam Latinam: cui pr√¶figuntur animadversiones in rudimenta nostra vulgaria, et Grammaticam Despauterianam ..., Glasgow, 1674. * Prima pars Grammatic√¶ in metrum redacta, Edinburgh, 1675. * Secunda pars Grammatic√¶ ..., Edinburgh, 1676. * ‚ÄòTertia et quarta pars Grammatic√¶,‚Äô Edinburgh, 1676. * All the Examples, both Words and Sentences, of the First part of grammar, translated into English by J. K., Edinburgh, 1676. * Grammatica delineata secundum sententiam plurium ..., London, 1677. * Rhetoric√¶ Compendium; cui subjicitur de Analysi Tractatiuncula, Edinburgh, 1678. Controversy Kirkwood published an account of the Linlithgow litigation in A Short Information of the Plea betwixt the Town Council of Lithgow and Mr. James Kirkwood, Schoolmaster there, whereof a more full account may perhaps come out hereafter (1690). Among other charges brought against Kirkwood was that he was \\"a reviler of the gods of the people\\". \\"By gods\\", says Kirkwood, \\"they mean the twenty-seven members of the town council\\". Many years later he published The History of the Twenty Seven Gods of Linlithgow; Being an exact and true Account of a Famous Plea betwixt the Town-Council of the said Burgh, and Mr. Kirkwood, Schoolmaster there. Seria Mixta Jocis, Edinburgh, 1711. It was dedicated to Sir David Dalrymple, whose elder brother, the \\"Earl of Stair\\", says the author, \\"not only sent his son, the present earl, to my school at Lithgow, but tabled him in my house\\". The work contains details of the social and religious state of affairs during the contention for supremacy between the Presbyterian and Prelatic parties. Kirkwood narrated his affairs at Kelso in Mr. Kirkwood's Plea before the Kirk, and Civil Judicatures of Scotland. Divided into Five Parts, London, printed by D. E. for the author, 1698, dedicated to the Countess of Roxburgh. Kirkwood made a crude attack on the character of the minister, Dr. Jaques, who replied in a Vindication against Master Kirkwood's Defamation. Kirkwood sent forth an Answer, without an imprint. Throughout his pamphleteering Kirkwood claimed high repute as a grammarian.

Description Females are reddish brown with yellow tints and with sooty spots; the males are also reddish brown with yellow-tinted wings, but these are never spotted. Females are 8.5-22.0 mm in length, and males 7.5-15.0 mm. They have a bold, jerky gait, and their vivid colour is aposematic to warn off visual predators such as birds and lizards. It is the only New Zealand Sphictostethus species that does not change from red to black when altitude or latitude increases. Its body stays red even at the most southern latitudes of its range. Biology Sphictostethus nitidus specimen held at Auckland War Memorial Museum Sphictostethus nitidus specimen held at Auckland War Memorial Museum S. nitidus hunts terrestrially in a variety of situations such as underneath and within logs, debris, and rotting wood, arboreally in shrubs and bushes, and on shingles and under boulders. The prey is usually detected by sight and pursued into the open. S. nitidus varies the attack depending on the species and size of spider. When Uliodon frenatus of any size is the prey, the wasp springs on to the back of the spider and stings the abdomen first before curving its abdomen and stinging the midventral region of the prosoma. Porrhothele antipodiana is attacked when it stands and faces the wasp with the first two pairs of legs held towards its attacker and upwards. The wasp moves forward until it is about in front the spider, then it makes a sudden leap towards it. The wasp and the spider grapple with each other, rolling over and over. The wasp apparently stings the spider indiscriminately in the abdomen until the spider ceases to struggle. The wasp then stings the spider in the midventer of the prosoma, and then between the chelicerae. The wasp then examines the spider's mouthparts before stinging it again at the base of the chelicerae. It finishes by brushing the tip of its own abdomen with alternate strokes of the entire hind tibia and tarsus for 3‚Äì8 minutes. The spider's paralysis is permanent. S. nitidus is kleptoparasitic on other members of its own species, and on other spider wasps, including Priocnemis monachus. Introduced house sparrows Passer domesticus have been observed stealing the paralysed spider prey from S. nitidus. S. nitidus is not a digger and prefers to use pre- existing cavities for nesting. After capturing and immobilising a spider, the wasp either takes it to a temporary storage site or leaves it exposed on its back. It then either returns to its nest site or locates a suitable cavity for nesting, often after examining several potential cavities. It returns to the prey at intervals before eventually dragging it to the nest and leaving it 25 mm from the entrance to the nest, going inside before reappearing to drag the spider into the nest by its spinnerets. Often, the wasp waits in the cell, under the spider, for 2‚Äì26 hours before laying an egg. After laying, it pauses between 15 minutes and 2 hours before filling the burrow with fragments of vegetation varying from 5 to 56 mm in length which are rammed firmly into place with the wasp's abdomen. When the nest is closed, the wasp camouflages the entrance with twigs and bark which is dragged across it. The wasp examines the nest and if satisfied it leaves. Males emerge 3‚Äì8 days prior to the females; copulation usually occurs in foliage, often in the crowns of bushes, the males running over leaves in a distinctive manner pursuing any females that appear. Prey recorded include Uliodon frenatus, Porrhothele antipodiana and Neoramia otagoa. Habitat S. nitidus shows a preference for open, exposed places and tolerates a wide range of habitats. It has shown itself to be adaptable and is common in suburban back yards, dunes, dry riverbeds, forest clearings, grasslands, and clay banks. Nests can be found from sea level up to at least 1370 m, in various substrates, but often among boulders, and especially beneath flat stones and concrete, where it can gain access to cavities through cracks. Distribution This species is endemic to New Zealand on both the North and South Islands and some offshore islands.

The house was built around 1830 and was designed by the noted Monmouth architect George Vaughan Maddox. It has been listed as Grade II since 1974. Part of the estate is being developed for housing, under the name Parc Glyndwr. During archaeological investigations in advance of development, excavations revealed the remains of a Neolithic crannog built on a man-made island away from the shore of a now-vanished lake, as well as evidence of a Bronze Age boatbuilding community on the site. Etymology The house name means \\"bull's croft\\". \\"'\\" is a Welsh word borrowed from the English \\"bull\\" and it appears in written form for the first time in 1253: '. The native and older word for bull in Welsh is \\"'\\", which is much more common. \\"'\\" also appears in placenames in Mid-Wales e.g. Carreg-y-Bwla, a working farm between Llangurig and Rhayader. History and architecture Croft-Y-Bwla was built in about 1830 for Thomas Dyke, a Monmouth grocer, and was designed by G.V. Maddox.John Newman, The Buildings of Wales: Gwent/Monmouthshire, Penguin Books, 2000, , p.410 It is sited on a low spur of land with a distant view of the town. The two-storey house is of classical design, square in plan with three bays on each side. The walls are smoothly rendered. The entrance porch is of greenish stone from the Forest of Dean, with a pair of Doric columns. On the south-east side there is a verandah, described in 2000 as \\"exquisite\\" but \\"much decayed\\". The house also has stables dating from the mid-19th century, and a single-storey roadside lodge also believed to have been designed by Maddox. The estate includes a garden lodge, carriage drive, parkland, greenhouse and conservatory. The actress Helen Barry once lived at the house with her husband Major Alexander Rolls (1818‚Äì1882), who was Mayor of Monmouth between 1870 and 1874 and the brother of John Etherington Welch Rolls.Keith Kissack, Victorian Monmouth, The Monmouth Historical and Educational trust, , page 45 Col J.H. Walwyn (1850‚Äì1900), Mayor of Monmouth in 1896, and his son Capt Fulke Walwyn D.S.O. lived at the house for a number of years. Capt Fulke Walwyn was one of the first wounded to return to Monmouth in 1914 following the start of World War I. In 1932 it was occupied by the Sheriff of Monmouthshire, the shipping magnate and MP, Sir William Henry Seager. Development A planning application to develop part of the area for housing was first submitted in 2004. Cooper Partnership, Land at Croft-Y-Bwla, Monmouth: Landscape and Visual Appraisal and Development Strategy, 2011. Accessed 16 April 2012 Several later proposals were made, to develop up to 145 dwellings on the site. The proposal was subsequently promoted for development through Monmouthshire County Council's Local Development Plan, South Wales Argus, Monmouth housing plan re- submitted, 17 February 2009. Accessed 16 April 2012 and a sustainability assessment of the site was undertaken. Monmouthshire County Council, CS/0202 Land at Croft-Y-Bwla . Accessed 16 April 2012 In 2011 planning permission was sought to develop the grounds into a golf course, driving range, hotel and conference centre. Development of part of the site for housing is taking place in 2012, with the estate being called \\"\\" by Charles Church Developments. It is promoted as \\"contemporary development, comprising a range of stylish 3 and 4 bedroom homes [which] offers well-proportioned living accommodation in a sought-after location.\\" Charles Church Development, '. Accessed 16 April 2012 =Archaeological discoveries= Evidence of a Bronze Age boatbuilding community, including three long channels adjoining the site of a now-vanished lake, was discovered in September 2013, during archaeological investigations by the Monmouth Archaeological Society of the Parc Glyndwr housing development site, immediately north-west of the town. The excavations later revealed the remains of a Neolithic crannog. The dwelling was constructed on stilts on a man-made island away from the lake shore in water up to deep. Oak timbers had been \\"skillfully\\" cut with stone or flint axes to form stilts, of posts and poles, which probably rested on three parallel fully-grown tree 'sleeper beams', up to wide, laid horizontally on the lake bed. Timbers from the structure were radiocarbon dated to 4867 years before present (BP).

A Spanish-Cuban co-production between La Zanfo√±a Producciones (Spain) and Producciones de la 5ta Avenida (Cuba) involving the participation of the ICAIC, Canal Sur and Televisi√≥n Espa√±ola, the film won the Goya Award for Best Spanish Language Foreign Film in 2012. Plot Juan (Alexis D√≠az de Villegas) is forty years old and has devoted the majority of his life to living in Cuba doing absolutely nothing. He is accompanied by his bumbling sidekick, Lazaro (Jorge Molina), who is just as lazy but the bigger fool (and accident-prone), on a makeshift fishing raft. Their line snags what they think is a corpse but it suddenly awakens and attacks them, ending with Lazaro shooting it in the head with his spear gun. They think nothing of it at first and go about their business as usual, which involves thuggish activity and associating with their less than reputable friends: Lazaro's vain, Americanized pretty-boy son Vladi California; drag queen La China, who is also an expert slingshot marksman; and China's hulk-like lover Primo (who faints at the sight of blood and has to wear a blindfold when fighting). The only emotional bond Juan has is with his daughter Camila (Andrea Duro), a young and beautiful girl who wants nothing to do with her father because the only thing he does is get in trouble. Suddenly a strange series of events begin to occur: people everywhere suddenly become violent and attack each other at random. After an encounter with an elderly neighbor's reanimated body, Juan comes to the conclusion that it is not vampires nor possession by demons, but capitalist dissidents. Lazaro attempts to flee with a woman he and the others have rescued, but Juan follows him to the raft they are trying to escape on. The woman falls into the water and is lost to them, leaving Lazaro with little reason to refuse Juan's plea for him to stay, and that Juan needs his sidekick. To Camila's dismay, Juan's idea to take advantage of the situation is revealed: He starts a business, which he rationalizes will also be a great help for other survivors, with the slogan: \\"Juan of the Dead: we kill your beloved ones. How can we help you?\\" For a price, the five men in the group enter homes and slay the zombified residents. Although extremely proficient in dispatching their quarry in open streets, they suffer from bad luck and high civilian and resident casualties on indoor missions. That, coupled with allowing their corruption to come out (by looting and even attacking humans that Lazaro claims owe him money) puts strain both on his relationship with his daughter, and the success of their business. The group is later rounded up by a shady military group, forcing them to strip naked and get into a truck. It seems they are recruiting able-bodied males to fight the zombie threat but some of the others who were rounded up before were infected, and they reanimate, causing a riot in the back of the truck and flipping it over, enabling Juan's group to flee, and further blunders on the military's part remove any hope they have of any kind of rescue or victory over the undead. China, who was bitten during the truck incident, dies and reanimates while handcuffed to Juan, and Vladi and Camila struggle to figure out a way to extricate Juan from his predicament. Juan finally throws China off the roof of their safe haven and Camila throws him some oil to lubricate zombie China's hand, letting him slip out of the cuffs and fall. The zombies have become too numerous to continue the group's business operations, forcing them to stay on rooftops for safety, sending Vladi out on one-man food retrieval missions which endears him to Camila. At this point the group is whittled down to Juan, Lazaro, Primo, Vladi, and Camila, the latter two having become romantically involved despite Juan's disapproval. Losing hope, they decide to try heading for the mountains which may be unpopulated and safer. An escape attempt via motor vehicle is thwarted by mechanical failure (and the fact that none of them knows how to drive), forcing them to flee on foot while pursued by hundreds of undead. Attempting to seek shelter in a bunker, yet another of Juan's ideas proves disastrous, as Primo, while prying open the door, reveals it is overrun and he is pulled in. The remaining group makes their way to a basketball court where a miraculous feat of vehicular zombie-slaying by a middle-aged white man with a harpoon gun mounted on his truck saves them after they become surrounded. He tries to tell the group what he knows about the situation in English, but the language barrier between them prevents him from divulging his plan to end the disaster, which he believes has religious implications. He is then accidentally killed by another of Lazaro's spear gun incidents, forcing the desperate group to come up with yet another plan for escape, and berating Lazaro for his continual screw-ups. Sheltering in a deserted parking garage the man had led them to, Lazaro amazingly comes up with a plan to make up for his repeated failures. According to his idea, they construct a flotation mechanism out of empty oil drums and attach them to a convertible, with the intention of attempting to drive through a group of zombies on the street and out onto the beach, where they can reach the water. They plan to float to Florida (where Camila's mother is known to be staying), hoping America might be safer. Lazaro confides to Juan that he had been bitten during their earlier escape, and they share an emotional goodbye while they wait for him to change, until it's revealed it was only a harmless scratch. Juan and Lazaro fight the zombies standing in their way to clear a path to the water for the car to drive over. Juan hears a child's crying and goes to investigate. He rescues a little boy from his zombified father and brings him to the car. Lazaro and Juan create a ramp of bodies for the car to jump over the wall separating the street from the sand, and the car makes it into the water. Preparing to float to freedom, the group is shocked when Juan gets out of the floating car and heads back to shore, explaining to his comrades that he belongs in his homeland and convincing them that he's going to do what he's always done best: Survive. The end credits are an animated cartoon showing Juan going through the horde of zombies. It is later shown that Camila, Lazaro and Vladi came back to join Juan in fighting the dead.

He is particularly well known for his opposition to forced removals in South Africa under the system of apartheid. Family Born Patrick Anthony Desmond, he was the seventh of eleven children to a family of Irish Catholics in London's East End. His father worked as a fumigator. Missionary Work Desmond received scholarships from several Catholic schools and became a Franciscan missionary, travelling to South Africa at the age of 21. He was assigned to a mission in KwaZulu-Natal. There he witnessed a number of forced removals of black residents under the Group Areas Act, which sought to preserve racial segregation along geographic lines. In 1969, Desmond traveled to Johannesburg to speak out against the practice. In the city, he befriended a number of black militants, including Steve Biko. The Discarded People In 1970, he published a book on forced removals under the titled The Discarded People. In its preface, British ambassador Hugh Foot, Baron Caradon described it as \\"an account of callous contempt for human suffering, the ugliness of systematic cruelty, and the self-righteousness of the oppressor\\" and a book that could change the course of history. The book triggered a wave of international attention to forced removals, including a documentary film titled Last Grave in Dimbaza. The book was soon banned in South Africa, and Desmond himself was subject to house arrest under the Suppression of Communism Act. Amnesty International named him a prisoner of conscience. As the church hierarchy disapproved of his activism, Desmond resigned from the priesthood in 1973. He later married human rights activist Snoeks Desmond, with whom he had three sons, but remained a Catholic. Exile He left South Africa in 1978 after the assassination of Richard Turner and returned to London where he worked for Amnesty International, heading its British section. After eighteen months, he was fired in a \\"power struggle\\" between volunteers and staff. He returned to South African in 1991 and in 1994 stood for parliament as a Pan Africanist Congress candidate, but was not elected. Return to South Africa After the end of apartheid, Desmond continued to advocate for the welfare of the poor, arguing that apartheid had not truly ended but had \\"a makeover and bought some new clothes\\". He felt that the leaders of post-apartheid South Africa had betrayed the trust of the anti-apartheid movement, particularly by failing to redistribute land on a large scale. Late in life, he headed the human rights branch of the NGO Children First, editing the organization's journal. In 2012, he died of Alzheimer's complications in Durban.

William Lilly successively treats the rules of western astrology, horary astrology and 'nativities', about erecting and analysing a birth chart in natal astrology. He wrote the book when he was ill and had to stay at home. Running away from the plague in London, he spent a year in the countryside to study, reflect, and write Christian Astrology.Autobiography: \\"William Lilly's History of His Life and Times: From the Year 1602 to 1681\\" Quadripartitum, 1622 Lilly himself explains that he was influenced among others by Ptolemy's Quadripartitum (Tetrabiblos), De occulta philosophia by Agrippa, De Astronima Tractarus 10 by Guido Bonatti, 120 Aphorismi of John Dee, Medicina Catholica by Robert Fludd, Epitomes Astronomiae by Johan Kepler and Paracelsus' De Meteoris, all of which are mentioned in the appendix of Christian Astrology. The modern edition of Christian Astrology consists of three volumes: #Book 1: An Introduction to Astrology #Book 2: The Resolution of all manners of Questions and Demands #Book 3: An Easie and Plaine Method How to Judge Upon Nativities Book 1 ;Introduction to Astrology Lilly referred to this book as a course for astrology students in which he expounds the general principles of astrology. Topics covered: *the use of the ephemeris *preparing the horoscope *the nature of the 12 signs of the zodiac *the nature of the planets *the nature of the 12 houses Book 2 ;About the solution of many questions and issues This part of Lilly's work is a methodical instruction the student must follow to be able to answer all kinds of questions - on disease, wealth, marriage choices, travel, etc. - using the techniques of horary astrology. Lilly includes 35 examples of such questions. He gives a detailed explanation of the procedure to be followed and elaborates on all elements that are important in the analysis. The act of choosing the right \\"significator\\" is especially important, as well as choosing the right house and its ruler that are involved. Book 3 ;An easy and clear method for the natal chart In this third part \\"How to judge upon Nativities' William Lilly discusses the interpretation of the natal chart. He treatment includes the following topics: *determining body build, shape, color and intelligence of the unborn * if the person will be born rich, which diseases he will likely suffer from, and whether he will suffer a violent death, his marriage, the number of spouses, their origin, his children and what will be the most appropriate career *In the section on primary directions (predictions by 'advancing' the birth planets according to a formula) Lilly gives advice on the use of solar returns, transits and the signification of the aspects the planets make. In addition, he also gives clues about how these techniques can be used to 'correct' a natal chart in case the time of birth is not exactly known to the astrologer. This he finds to be of major importance to make accurate predictions.

The election used the six wards created under the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004, with 22 Councillors being elected. Each ward elected either 3 or 4 members, using the STV electoral system. The election saw the Scottish Labour Party gain 2 seats to secure an overall majority on the Council while also significantly increasing their vote. The Scottish National Party remained in second place on the Council but West Dunbartonshire proved to be their worst performance in Scotland as they lost 3 seats including that of their former Council leader, Ronnie McColl. Independents increased their seat numbers to 3 through the addition of former Labour Councillor and the Scottish Socialist Party retained their sole seat in Scotland.

It aired on CBS in the United States on April 10, 2012. The episode is written by Allison Abner and directed by Arvin Brown, and was seen by 17.66 million viewers. Plot After the corpse of a Marine lieutenant falls out of the sky, Tony helps Ziva and her mentor, Monique, look for missing Navy Chaplain Wade in Colombia. Chaplain Castro, who is one of Wade's colleagues, also decides to travel with them. They theorize that Wade had been kidnapped by a local drug cartel while vaccinating villagers, and narrowly escape an ambush. Chaplain Castro reveals that part of the reason why she is helping them is because she was supposed to have performed Wade's mission. Meanwhile, Gibbs and McGee try to track down the plane that dropped the body. Ryan informs him that the vaccination mission was a covert CIA operation to obtain the DNA of cartel leaders. Tony, Ziva, and Monique manage to rescue Wade from the cartel and escape Colombia. Monique decides to stay behind, admitting that she is involved in something too serious to reveal. Jimmy Palmer chooses his best man but in a surprise twist, he chooses Abby to be his best woman much to her delight. Production \\"The Missionary Position\\" is written by Allison Abner and directed by Arvin Brown. This is Abner's first episode on NCIS, and was a freelance assignment. Executive producer Gary Glasberg stated \\"we were lucky to get her for this freelance assignment. Freelancing on any show can be difficult and this program is no exception\\". Abner has previously worked on shows including The West Wing and Without a Trace. The end scene with Ziva and Monique at the military airport was filmed right outside the studio and not at an airport. \\"As for a secret detail of the episode, remember the military airport where Ziva and Monique say their goodbye at the end of the story? That was actually the entrance to our studio and, thanks to our extraordinary special effects and post production team, it miraculously became a working air field\\". Both Brian Dietzen and Jamie Lee Curtis are recurring in this episode. Reception \\"The Missionary Position\\" was seen by 17.66 million live viewers following its broadcast on April 10, 2012, with a 10.9/17 share among all households, and 3.1/9 share among adults aged 18 to 49. A rating point represents one percent of the total number of television sets in American households, and a share means the percentage of television sets in use tuned to the program. In total viewers, \\"The Missionary Position\\" easily won NCIS and CBS the night, while the spin-off NCIS: Los Angeles drew third and was seen by 12.86 million viewers. Compared to the last episode \\"The Good Son\\", \\"The Missionary Position\\" was down a bit in both viewers and adults 18-49. Steve Marsi from TV Fanatic gave the episode 4.5 (out of 5) and stated that \\"more questions were asked than answered, and none greater than what Dr. Samantha Ryan (Jamie Lee Curtis) knows about the mysterious Monique Lisson (Karina Lombard), whose penchant for secrecy and suspicious background were evident from the start. In that respect, Lisson is a fitting adversary for Ryan. All in all, an unconventional but solid episode with both a satisfying conclusion and plenty left unresolved\\".

Provisions Section 3 of the Act required that an election to a county constituency had to take place at the county court, and that the court had to be held at the place where it had most often been held in the preceding forty years (in effect, at the county town). This was to prevent an electoral abuse where the county sheriff held the election at a place more convenient for voters favourable to one of the candidates. Section 6 sought to prevent faggot voters by requiring that the a voter's forty shilling freehold was a bona fide holding and not a temporary conveyance. Section 7 established the minimum voting age and age of candidacy as 21, which was the age of majority under common law. Underage MPs were seldom unseated before the Reform Act 1832: Vicount Jocelyn was 18 in 1806. Section 8 provided that polling in Yorkshire, previously begun on a Monday, should instead begin on Wednesday. This was from a sabbatarian desire to prevent voters travelling on Sunday to the polling place. Section 9 provided that the poll for Hampshire would be taken first at Winchester and then, after an adjournment, at Newport for the convenience of voters on the Isle of Wight. Repeal Some of the Act was implicitly repealed by the Reform Act 1832. The whole Act except section 7 was, and in section 7 the words from the beginning of the section to \\"any future parliament\\" where those words first occurred were, repealed by section 80(7) of, and Schedule 13 to, the Representation of the People Act 1948.

Plot  Fish n' chips follows the story of Andy, a Greek Cypriot immigrant in London, who works like a slave with his ex-East German girlfriend Karin and her daughter, Emma, in a fish shop, owned by Jimmy a Turkish Cypriot (he uses Jimmy as a nickname. His real name is Hassan). Andy's old mother suffers from dementia and is causing Andy a lot of trouble, as she often runs away. The film starts with her escaping, imagining that she is returning to her homeland. So Andy finds the perfect excuse to take his mother to Cyprus and at the same time, he can offer his ‚Äúfamily‚Äù some rest and relaxation. Jimmy, the owner of the shop, though, has different ideas since he depends heavily on Andy‚Äôs skill and phenomenal output. The two men argue and Andy merely manages to get fired. Andy, who has already made up his mind to propose marriage to Karin, decides not to tell her that they have lost their job. So, they go to Cyprus for holidays. Staying with Andy‚Äôs brother Anestis and his family in an impressively huge house, Andy, sensing how delighted Karin and her daughter are to be in Cyprus, persuades them to follow their dreams by opening their own fish ‚Äòn chip shop there. Unfortunately the enterprise flops since Andy failed to realize that the beach where he had been led to open his shop by his brother, is frequented by Cypriot locals who are not fish n' chip lovers. The failure brings misery and creates conflict between Andy and his brother, and between Karin and Emma. Andy refuses to face reality and struggles to keep the shop going, but he only succeeds in being left alone by everyone, specially by his girlfriend Karin and Emma who both go back to London to return to their previous job at Jimmy‚Äôs Fish shop. However his mother - who keeps running away from him searching for her own homeland even being in Cyprus - gets inside her own house in Northern Cyprus which is now bought by a retired British old lady sold by his own brother behind his back. The final blow for Andy comes when he finds that his real father was not killed during the war by the Turkish army as he was always believed but it is Jimmy the owner of the fish shop in London. The hidden love story between his mother and Hassan (Jimmy) unfolds and shakes his stereotypes. Andy realises that he is nothing more than a tourist in his own homeland, and that home is where a person fits best. Andy, now with the scales lifted from his eyes, returns to London, home, where he finds that Hassan (Jimmy) has given him the fish shop in London.

It is organised by Bombay Natural History Society and Ministry of Environment and Forests (India) in partnership with the National Centre for Biological Sciences and Nature Conservation Foundation. Several other Indian Non Governmental Organisations collaborate with this project. Aim of the project Citizen Sparrow is a public participatory project in which all members of the public are encouraged to contribute information on presence and absence of the house sparrow. This project is motivated by the observation that house sparrows have declined in many parts of India, while in a few other parts their numbers are reported to be stable. Citizen Sparrow project provides a website where registered members can upload observations of presence and absence of house sparrow from different locations and for different time period. All the observational records are plotted on a map. Duration of the project  This project is planned to run for two months, that is, from 1 April 2012 to 31 May 2012. This project aimed to collect information and to answer few questions such as, where are sparrows still found in India? Where were they found before? Where have they declined the most?

Water and air pollution are the biggest risks to human health from hydraulic fracturing. Research has determined that human health is affected. Adherence to regulation and safety procedures is required to avoid further negative impacts. Hydraulic fracturing fluids include proppants and other substances, which may include toxic chemicals. In the United States, such additives may be treated as trade secrets by companies who use them. Lack of knowledge about specific chemicals has complicated efforts to develop risk management policies and to study health effects. In other jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom, these chemicals must be made public and their applications are required to be nonhazardous. Water usage by hydraulic fracturing can be a problem in areas that experience water shortage. Surface water may be contaminated through spillage and improperly built and maintained waste pits, in jurisdictions where these are permitted. Further, ground water can be contaminated if fracturing fluids and formation fluids are able to escape during hydraulic fracturing. However, the possibility of groundwater contamination from the fracturing fluid upward migration is negligible, even in a long-term period. Produced water, the water that returns to the surface after hydraulic fracturing, is managed by underground injection, municipal and commercial wastewater treatment, and reuse in future wells. There is potential for methane to leak into ground water and the air, though escape of methane is a bigger problem in older wells than in those built under more recent legislation. Hydraulic fracturing causes induced seismicity called microseismic events or microearthquakes. The magnitude of these events is too small to be detected at the surface, being of magnitude M-3 to M-1 usually. However, fluid disposal wells (which are often used in the USA to dispose of polluted waste from several industries) have been responsible for earthquakes up to 5.6M in Oklahoma and other states. Governments worldwide are developing regulatory frameworks to assess and manage environmental and associated health risks, working under pressure from industry on the one hand, and from anti- fracking groups on the other. In some countries like France a precautionary approach has been favored and hydraulic fracturing has been banned. The United Kingdom's regulatory framework is based on the conclusion that the risks associated with hydraulic fracturing are manageable if carried out under effective regulation and if operational best practices are implemented.  Air emissions  A report for the European Union on the potential risks was produced in 2012. Potential risks are \\"methane emissions from the wells, diesel fumes and other hazardous pollutants, ozone precursors or odours from hydraulic fracturing equipment, such as compressors, pumps, and valves\\". Also gases and hydraulic fracturing fluids dissolved in flowback water pose air emissions risks. One study measured various air pollutants weekly for a year surrounding the development of a newly fractured gas well and detected nonmethane hydrocarbons, methylene chloride (a toxic solvent), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. These pollutants have been shown to affect fetal outcomes. The relationship between hydraulic fracturing and air quality can influence acute and chronic respiratory illnesses, including exacerbation of asthma (induced by airborne particulates, ozone and exhaust from equipment used for drilling and transport) and COPD. For example, communities overlying the Marcellus shale have higher frequencies of asthma. Children, active young adults who spend time outdoors, and the elderly are particularly vulnerable. OSHA has also raised concerns about the long-term respiratory effects of occupational exposure to airborne silica at hydraulic fracturing sites. Silicosis can be associated with systemic autoimmune processes. \\"In the UK, all oil and gas operators must minimise the release of gases as a condition of their licence from the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC). Natural gas may only be vented for safety reasons.\\" Also transportation of necessary water volume for hydraulic fracturing, if done by trucks, can cause emissions. Piped water supplies can reduce the number of truck movements necessary. A report from the Pennsylvania Dept of Environmental Protection indicated that there is little potential for radiation exposure from oil and gas operations. Air pollution is of particular concern to workers at hydraulic fracturing well sites as the chemical emissions from storage tanks and open flowback pits combine with the geographically compounded air concentrations from surrounding wells. Thirty seven percent of the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations are volatile and can become airborne. Researchers Chen and Carter from the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Tennessee, Knoxville used atmospheric dispersion models (AERMOD) to estimate the potential exposure concentration of emissions for calculated radial distances of 5 m to 180m from emission sources. The team examined emissions from 60,644 hydraulic fracturing wells and found ‚Äúresults showed the percentage of wells and their potential acute non-cancer, chronic non-cancer, acute cancer, and chronic cancer risks for exposure to workers were 12.41%, 0.11%, 7.53%, and 5.80%, respectively. Acute and chronic cancer risks were dominated by emissions from the chemical storage tanks within a 20 m radius. =Climate change= Whether natural gas produced by hydraulic fracturing causes higher well-to-burner emissions than gas produced from conventional wells is a matter of contention. Some studies have found that hydraulic fracturing has higher emissions due to methane released during completing wells as some gas returns to the surface, together with the fracturing fluids. Depending on their treatment, the well-to-burner emissions are 3.5%‚Äì12% higher than for conventional gas. A debate has arisen particularly around a study by professor Robert W. Howarth finding shale gas significantly worse for global warming than oil or coal. Other researchers have criticized Howarth's analysis, including Cathles et al., whose estimates were substantially lower.\\" A 2012 industry funded report co-authored by researchers at the United States Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory found emissions from shale gas, when burned for electricity, were \\"very similar\\" to those from so-called \\"conventional well\\" natural gas, and less than half the emissions of coal. Several studies which have estimated lifecycle methane leakage from natural gas development and production have found a wide range of leakage rates. According to the Environmental Protection Agency's Greenhouse Gas Inventory, the methane leakage rate is about 1.4%. A 16-part assessment of methane leakage from natural gas production initiated by the Environmental Defense Fund found that fugitive emissions in key stages of the natural gas production process are significantly higher than estimates in the EPA's national emission inventory, with a leakage rate of 2.3 percent of overall natural gas output.  Water consumption  Massive hydraulic fracturing typical of shale wells uses between of water per well, with large projects using up to . Additional water is used when wells are refractured. An average well requires of water over its lifetime. According to the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, greater volumes of fracturing fluids are required in Europe, where the shale depths average 1.5 times greater than in the U.S. Whilst the published amounts may seem large, they are small in comparison with the overall water usage in most areas. A study in Texas, which is a water shortage area, indicates \\"Water use for shale gas is <1% of statewide water withdrawals; however, local impacts vary with water availability and competing demands.\\" A report by the Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering shows the usage expected for hydraulic fracturing a well is approximately the amount needed to run a 1,000 MW coal-fired power plant for 12 hours. A 2011 report from the Tyndall Centre estimates that to support a gas production industry, between would be needed annually, which amounts to 0.01% of the total water abstraction nationally. Concern has been raised over the increasing quantities of water for hydraulic fracturing in areas that experience water stress. Use of water for hydraulic fracturing can divert water from stream flow, water supplies for municipalities and industries such as power generation, as well as recreation and aquatic life. The large volumes of water required for most common hydraulic fracturing methods have raised concerns for arid regions, such as the Karoo in South Africa, and in drought- prone Texas, in North America. It may also require water overland piping from distant sources. A 2014 life cycle analysis of natural gas electricity by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory concluded that electricity generated by natural gas from massive hydraulically fractured wells consumed between 249 gallons per megawatt-hour (gal/MWhr) (Marcellus trend) and 272 gal/MWhr (Barnett Shale). The water consumption for the gas from massive hydraulic fractured wells was from 52 to 75 gal/MWhr greater (26 percent to 38 percent greater) than the 197 gal/MWhr consumed for electricity from conventional onshore natural gas.Life Cycle Analysis of Natural Gas Extraction and Power Generation, NREL, DOE/NETL-2014-1646, 29 May 2014. Some producers have developed hydraulic fracturing techniques that could reduce the need for water. Using carbon dioxide, liquid propane or other gases instead of water have been proposed to reduce water consumption. After it is used, the propane returns to its gaseous state and can be collected and reused. In addition to water savings, gas fracturing reportedly produces less damage to rock formations that can impede production. Recycled flowback water can be reused in hydraulic fracturing. It lowers the total amount of water used and reduces the need to dispose of wastewater after use. The technique is relatively expensive, however, since the water must be treated before each reuse and it can shorten the life of some types of equipment. Water contamination =Injected fluid= In the United States, hydraulic fracturing fluids include proppants, radionuclide tracers, and other chemicals, many of which are toxic. The type of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing and their properties vary. While most of them are common and generally harmless, some chemicals are carcinogenic. Out of 2,500 products used as hydraulic fracturing additives in the United States, 652 contained one or more of 29 chemical compounds which are either known or possible human carcinogens, regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act for their risks to human health, or listed as hazardous air pollutants under the Clean Air Act. Another 2011 study identified 632 chemicals used in United States natural gas operations, of which only 353 are well-described in the scientific literature. A study that assessed health effects of chemicals used in fracturing found that 73% of the products had between 6 and 14 different adverse health effects including skin, eye, and sensory organ damage; respiratory distress including asthma; gastrointestinal and liver disease; brain and nervous system harms; cancers; and negative reproductive effects. An expansive study conducted by the Yale School of Public Health in 2016 found numerous chemicals involved in or released by hydraulic fracturing are carcinogenic. Of the 119 compounds identified in this study with sufficient data, ‚Äú44% of the water pollutants...were either confirmed or possible carcinogens.‚Äù However, the majority of chemicals lacked sufficient data on carcinogenic potential, highlighting the knowledge gap in this area. Further research is needed to identify both carcinogenic potential of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing and their cancer risk. The European Union regulatory regime requires full disclosure of all additives. According to the EU groundwater directive of 2006, \\"in order to protect the environment as a whole, and human health in particular, detrimental concentrations of harmful pollutants in groundwater must be avoided, prevented or reduced.\\" In the United Kingdom, only chemicals that are \\"non hazardous in their application\\" are licensed by the Environment Agency. =Flowback= Less than half of injected water is recovered as flowback or later production brine, and in many cases recovery is <30%. As the fracturing fluid flows back through the well, it consists of spent fluids and may contain dissolved constituents such as minerals and brine waters. In some cases, depending on the geology of the formation, it may contain uranium, radium, radon and thorium. Estimates of the amount of injected fluid returning to the surface range from 15-20% to 30‚Äì70%. Approaches to managing these fluids, commonly known as produced water, include underground injection, municipal and commercial wastewater treatment and discharge, self-contained systems at well sites or fields, and recycling to fracture future wells. The vacuum multi-effect membrane distillation system as a more effective treatment system has been proposed for treatment of flowback. However, the quantity of waste water needing treatment and the improper configuration of sewage plants have become an issue in some regions of the United States. Part of the wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations is processed there by public sewage treatment plants, which are not equipped to remove radioactive material and are not required to test for it. Produced water spills and subsequent contamination of groundwater also presents a risk for exposure to carcinogens. Research that modeled the solute transport of BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene) and naphthalene for a range of spill sizes on contrasting soils overlying groundwater at different depths found that benzene and toluene were expected to reach human health relevant concentration in groundwater because of their high concentrations in produced water, relatively low solid/liquid partition coefficient and low EPA drinking water limits for these contaminants. Benzene is a known carcinogen which affects the central nervous system in the short term and can affect the bone marrow, blood production, immune system, and urogenital systems with long term exposure. =Surface spills= Surface spills related to the hydraulic fracturing occur mainly because of equipment failure or engineering misjudgments. Volatile chemicals held in waste water evaporation ponds can evaporate into the atmosphere, or overflow. The runoff can also end up in groundwater systems. Groundwater may become contaminated by trucks carrying hydraulic fracturing chemicals and wastewater if they are involved in accidents on the way to hydraulic fracturing sites or disposal destinations. In the evolving European Union legislation, it is required that \\"Member States should ensure that the installation is constructed in a way that prevents possible surface leaks and spills to soil, water or air.\\" Evaporation and open ponds are not permitted. Regulations call for all pollution pathways to be identified and mitigated. The use of chemical proof drilling pads to contain chemical spills is required. In the UK, total gas security is required, and venting of methane is only permitted in an emergency. =Methane= In September 2014, a study from the US 'Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences' released a report that indicated that methane contamination can be correlated to distance from a well in wells that were known to leak. This however was not caused by the hydraulic fracturing process, but by poor cementation of casings. Groundwater methane contamination has adverse effect on water quality and in extreme cases may lead to potential explosion. A scientific study conducted by researchers of Duke University found high correlations of gas well drilling activities, including hydraulic fracturing, and methane pollution of the drinking water. According to the 2011 study of the MIT Energy Initiative, \\"there is evidence of natural gas (methane) migration into freshwater zones in some areas, most likely as a result of substandard well completion practices i.e. poor quality cementing job or bad casing, by a few operators.\\" A 2013 Duke study suggested that either faulty construction (defective cement seals in the upper part of wells, and faulty steel linings within deeper layers) combined with a peculiarity of local geology may be allowing methane to seep into waters; the latter cause may also release injected fluids to the aquifer. Abandoned gas and oil wells also provide conduits to the surface in areas like Pennsylvania, where these are common. A study by Cabot Oil and Gas examined the Duke study using a larger sample size, found that methane concentrations were related to topography, with the highest readings found in low-lying areas, rather than related to distance from gas production areas. Using a more precise isotopic analysis, they showed that the methane found in the water wells came from both the formations where hydraulic fracturing occurred, and from the shallower formations. The Colorado Oil & Gas Conservation Commission investigates complaints from water well owners, and has found some wells to contain biogenic methane unrelated to oil and gas wells, but others that have thermogenic methane due to oil and gas wells with leaking well casing. A review published in February 2012 found no direct evidence that hydraulic fracturing actual injection phase resulted in contamination of ground water, and suggests that reported problems occur due to leaks in its fluid or waste storage apparatus; the review says that methane in water wells in some areas probably comes from natural resources. Another 2013 review found that hydraulic fracturing technologies are not free from risk of contaminating groundwater, and described the controversy over whether the methane that has been detected in private groundwater wells near hydraulic fracturing sites has been caused by drilling or by natural processes. Radionuclides There are naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM), for example radium, radon, uranium, and thorium, in shale deposits. Brine co- produced and brought to the surface along with the oil and gas sometimes contains naturally occurring radioactive materials; brine from many shale gas wells, contains these radioactive materials. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and regulators in North Dakota consider radioactive material in flowback a potential hazard to workers at hydraulic fracturing drilling and waste disposal sites and those living or working nearby if the correct procedures are not followed. A report from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection indicated that there is little potential for radiation exposure from oil and gas operations.  Land usage  In the UK, the likely well spacing visualised by the December 2013 DECC Strategic Environmental Assessment report indicated that well pad spacings of 5 km were likely in crowded areas, with up to per well pad. Each pad could have 24 separate wells. This amounts to 0.16% of land area. A study published in 2015 on the Fayetteville Shale found that a mature gas field impacted about 2% of the land area and substantially increased edge habitat creation. Average land impact per well was 3 hectares (about 7 acres) Research indicates that effects on ecosystem services costs (i.e. those processes that the natural world provides to humanity)has reached over $250 million per year in the U.S.  Seismicity  Hydraulic fracturing causes induced seismicity called microseismic events or microearthquakes. These microseismic events are often used to map the horizontal and vertical extent of the fracturing. The magnitude of these events is usually too small to be detected at the surface, although the biggest micro-earthquakes may have the magnitude of about -1.5 (Mw). =Induced seismicity from hydraulic fracturing= As of August 2016, there were at least nine known cases of fault reactivation by hydraulic fracturing that caused induced seismicity strong enough to be felt by humans at the surface: In Canada, there have been three in Alberta (M 4.8 and M 4.4 and M 4.4) and three in British Columbia (M 4.6, M 4.4 and M 3.8); In the United States there has been: one in Oklahoma (M 2.8) and one in Ohio (M 3.0), and; In the United Kingdom, there have been two in Lancashire (M 2.3 and M 1.5). =Induced seismicity from water disposal wells= According to the USGS only a small fraction of roughly 30,000 waste fluid disposal wells for oil and gas operations in the United States have induced earthquakes that are large enough to be of concern to the public. Although the magnitudes of these quakes has been small, the USGS says that there is no guarantee that larger quakes will not occur. In addition, the frequency of the quakes has been increasing. In 2009, there were 50 earthquakes greater than magnitude 3.0 in the area spanning Alabama and Montana, and there were 87 quakes in 2010. In 2011 there were 134 earthquakes in the same area, a sixfold increase over 20th century levels. There are also concerns that quakes may damage underground gas, oil, and water lines and wells that were not designed to withstand earthquakes. A 2012 US Geological Survey study reported that a \\"remarkable\\" increase in the rate of M ‚â• 3 earthquakes in the US midcontinent \\"is currently in progress\\", having started in 2001 and culminating in a 6-fold increase over 20th century levels in 2011. The overall increase was tied to earthquake increases in a few specific areas: the Raton Basin of southern Colorado (site of coalbed methane activity), and gas-producing areas in central and southern Oklahoma, and central Arkansas. While analysis suggested that the increase is \\"almost certainly man-made\\", the USGS noted: \\"USGS's studies suggest that the actual hydraulic fracturing process is only very rarely the direct cause of felt earthquakes.\\" The increased earthquakes were said to be most likely caused by increased injection of gas-well wastewater into disposal wells. The injection of waste water from oil and gas operations, including from hydraulic fracturing, into saltwater disposal wells may cause bigger low-magnitude tremors, being registered up to 3.3 (Mw).  Noise  Each well pad (in average 10 wells per pad) needs during preparatory and hydraulic fracturing process about 800 to 2,500 days of activity, which may affect residents. In addition, noise is created by transport related to the hydraulic fracturing activities. Noise pollution from hydraulic fracturing operations (e.g., traffic, flares/burn-offs) is often cited as a source of psychological distress, as well as poor academic performance in children. For example, the low-frequency noise that comes from well pumps contributes to irritation, unease, and fatigue. The UK Onshore Oil and Gas (UKOOG) is the industry representative body, and it has published a charter that shows how noise concerns will be mitigated, using sound insulation, and heavily silenced rigs where this is needed. Safety issues In July 2013, the United States Federal Railroad Administration listed oil contamination by hydraulic fracturing chemicals as \\"a possible cause\\" of corrosion in oil tank cars.Frederick J. Herrmann, Federal Railroad Administration, letter to American Petroleum Institute, 17 July 2013, p.4.  Community impacts  Impacted communities are often already vulnerable, including poor, rural, or indigenous persons, who may continue to experience the deleterious effects of hydraulic fracturing for generations. Competition for resources between farmers and oil companies contributes to stress for agricultural workers and their families, as well as to a community-level ‚Äúus versus them‚Äù mentality that creates community distress (Morgan et al. 2016). Rural communities that host hydraulic fracturing operations often experience a ‚Äúboom/bust cycle,‚Äù whereby their population surges, consequently exerting stress on community infrastructure and service provision capabilities (e.g., medical care, law enforcement). Indigenous and agricultural communities may be particularly impacted by hydraulic fracturing, given their historical attachment to, and dependency on, the land they live on, which is often damaged as a result of the hydraulic fracturing process. Native Americans, particularly those living on rural reservations, may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of fracturing; that is, on the one hand, tribes may be tempted to engage with the oil companies to secure a source of income but, on the other hand, must often engage in legal battles to protect their sovereign rights and the natural resources of their land. Policy and science There are two main approaches to regulation that derive from policy debates about how to manage risk and a corresponding debate about how to assess risk.Office of Research and Development US Environmental Protection Agency. November 2011 Plan to Study the Potential Impacts of Hydraulic Fracturing on Drinking Water Resources The two main schools of regulation are science-based assessment of risk and the taking of measures to prevent harm from those risks through an approach like hazard analysis, and the precautionary principle, where action is taken before risks are well-identified.Editors, ParisTech Review 28 March 2014 Is it really possible to enforce the precautionary principle? The relevance and reliability of risk assessments in communities where hydraulic fracturing occurs has also been debated amongst environmental groups, health scientists, and industry leaders. The risks, to some, are overplayed and the current research is insufficient in showing the link between hydraulic fracturing and adverse health effects, while to others the risks are obvious and risk assessment is underfunded. Different regulatory approaches have thus emerged. In France and Vermont for instance, a precautionary approach has been favored and hydraulic fracturing has been banned based on two principles: the precautionary principle and the prevention principle. Nevertheless, some States such as the U.S. have adopted a risk assessment approach, which had led to many regulatory debates over the issue of hydraulic fracturing and its risks. In the UK, the regulatory framework is largely being shaped by a report commissioned by the UK Government in 2012, whose purpose was to identify the problems around hydraulic fracturing and to advise the country's regulatory agencies. Jointly published by the Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering, under the chairmanship of Professor Robert Mair, the report features ten recommendations covering issues such as groundwater contamination, well integrity, seismic risk, gas leakages, water management, environmental risks, best practice for risk management, and also includes advice for regulators and research councils. The report was notable for stating that the risks associated with hydraulic fracturing are manageable if carried out under effective regulation and if operational best practices are implemented. A 2013 review concluded that, in the US, confidentiality requirements dictated by legal investigations have impeded peer-reviewed research into environmental impacts. There are numerous scientific limitations to the study of the environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing. The main limitation is the difficulty in developing effective monitoring procedures and protocols, for which there are several main reasons: * Variability among fracturing sites in terms of ecosystems, operation sizes, pad densities, and quality-control measures makes it difficult to develop a standard protocol for monitoring. * As more fracturing sites develop, the chance for interaction between sites increases, greatly compounding the effects and making monitoring of one site difficult to control. These cumulative effects can be difficult to measure, as many of the impacts develop very slowly. * Due to the vast number of chemicals involved in hydraulic fracturing, developing baseline data is challenging. In addition, there is a lack of research on the interaction of the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing fluid and the fate of the individual components.

Danica Coto. Huffington Latino Voices. 05/08/12 (8 May 2012). Retrieved 4 December 2012. English is taught as a second language and is a compulsory subject from elementary levels to high school. In 2012 pro-U.S. statehood Governor Luis Fortu√±o proposed that all courses in Puerto Rico public schools be taught in English instead of Spanish as they currently are. The proposal met with stiff opposition from the Puerto Rico Teachers Association while others, including former Education Secretary Gloria Baquero, were pessimistic about the success of the governor's plan overall for reasons that ranged from historical to cultural to political. This 10-year plan is still underway, but there are some private schools that already have existing English-based curriculums. Linguistic influences =English on Spanish= Because of the island's current relationship with the U.S., English has a substantial presence and is seen in various media outlets including newspapers, magazines, cable TV, radio stations, and commercial signs.http://aliciapousada.weebly.com/uploads/1/0/0/2/10020146/being_bilingual_in_puerto_rico2.pdf As a result of this exposure, Puerto Ricans often mix elements of the English language into their own Spanish language, developing new linguistic forms. This kind of incorporation of English into Puerto Rican Spanish is called anglicism, and three prominent forms of anglicism present in Puerto Rico are total linguistic borrowing, semantic borrowing, and syntactical borrowing. Total linguistic borrowing occurs when an English word is used in Spanish with more or less the same pronunciation. A few examples in which the complete English word has been borrowed are: flash light, Girl Scout, and weekend. The correct Spanish word for these are linterna, exploradora, and fin de semana, respectively. Examples in which the English words or terms are used while pronounced according to the native rules are seen for the English word/term to park, where it is said and pronounced as parquear, instead of the South American/Caribbean-Spanish word for to park which is estacionar. Other examples of this are the English word pamphlet, said as panfleto instead of folleto, and the English word muffler, said as mofle instead of silenciador. In semantic borrowing, the meaning of a Spanish word is altered or changed because of its similarity to an English word. For example, the Spanish word romance refers to a poetic literary composition, however, it has been given the English meaning of the English word romance. The Spanish word for romance is actually idilio. Another example of this is the Spanish word bloques, which means \\"building blocks\\", but is given the English meaning of \\"street blocks\\". The actual South American/Caribbean-Spanish word that means \\"street blocks\\" is cuadras. In syntactical borrowing, Spanish words are used in an English sentence structure. For example, in Spanish, personal pronoun subjects are not included as frequently as in English: \\"I run\\" is often said as \\"yo corro\\" instead as \\"corro\\". Another example: \\"He has cordially invited his friend\\" is often said as \\"√âl ha cordialmente invitado a su amigo\\" instead of \\"√âl ha invitado cordialmente a su amigo\\" or \\"Ha invitado cordialmente a su amigo.\\" There is a phonological influence of American English on Puerto Rican Spanish, wherein syllable-final can be realized as , aside from , , and [l]; \\"verso\\"' (verse) becomes , aside from , , or , \\"invierno\\" (winter) becomes , aside from , , or , and \\"parlamento\\" (parliament) becomes , aside from , , or []. In word-final position, will usually be; * either a trill, a tap, approximant, , or elided when followed by a consonant or a pause, as in amo paterno 'paternal love', amor ), * a tap, approximant, or when the followed by a vowel-initial word, as in amo eterno 'eternal love'). =Spanish on English= There is an important influence of Puerto Rican Spanish on the accent of American English. As with any other case of a non-native learning a language, many Puerto Ricans learn a particular accent of English. If learned in the US, they may speak English as it is spoken in their region. Some Puerto Ricans still residing in the island acquire a distinctly American accent when speaking. Others will develop different variations of the accent depending on who or what the main influence was during the learning process. This is due not only to the fact that English is taught from the first grade in most schools, but also that most English teachers (particularly private school teachers) are very fluent in the language. Residents of areas with large populations of African descendants such as Loiza, or the islands of Vieques and Culebra, tend to acquire a distinct Caribbean accent when speaking English, similar to that of nearby islands in the West Indies, most notably the nearby Virgin Islands. These residents typically retain American English phonology. A Puerto Rican's accent depends entirely on who or what was the main influence during the learning process of the English language. Because of this, there is no definitive Puerto Rican accent in English. Cultural issues =2012 Republican primary= In 2012 U.S. presidential candidate Rick Santorum caused a firestorm during the runup to the Puerto Rican Republican primary by stating that if Puerto Rico opted to become a state, it would have to make English its primary language. As the New York Times reported: Santorum opponent Mitt Romney's campaign issued a statement contrasting his position on the issue with Santorum's. \\"Puerto Rico currently recognizes both English and Spanish as the official languages of the commonwealth,\\" Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul said. \\"Gov. Romney believes that English is the language of opportunity and supports efforts to expand English proficiency in Puerto Rico and across America. However, he would not, as a prerequisite for statehood, require that the people of Puerto Rico cease using Spanish.\\" See also * Puerto Rican Spanish * History of Puerto Rico * English language * American English * Caribbean English References =Further reading= * Muniz-Arguelles, Luis.

A typical performance lasts from 3 to 5 minutes. Scriabin, who was a pianist, had never before composed for orchestra, except for a few unpublished works. However, he composed the work in total secrecy, without any advice. Composition In November 1898, when Scriabin went to Saint Petersburg, he brought a present for his patron and publisher M.P. Bela√Øeff. The offer was the full score of an orchestral work named Pr√©lude, a short miniature in E minor and ternary form. One day, his friend Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov came to visit him and played the work on the piano. He deemed it Delightful, wheated in piquant harmonies and not badly orchestrated. Since Bela√Øeff thought the French title Pr√©lude did not fit an orchestral work, he and Scriabin decided to rename it R√™verie. As Bela√Øeff's editions were published in French (or German) and Russian, they further discussed about the Slavic title. They had to choose between mechty (daydreams) or gryozy (musings). They agreed on the first. After hearing the rehearsals, Scriabin wrote: > \\"Imagine my joy, the piece sounds very well. At the rehearsal on 1 December > Korsakov was so sweet. He had each section go through its parts separately > and spent a whole hour in it [...]\\" The piece was premi√®red on 5 December 1898 in Saint Petersburg after Balakirev's Tamara. It was very well received, and Rimsky-Korsakov had to encore it. After this, Scriabin played a selection of his √©tudes, pr√©ludes and impromptus at the piano.

Having between a fifth or sixth ( 15-20 % ) of the arable or good pastoral land and roughly the same amount of coastline as England and Wales, marginal pastoral agriculture and fishing were two of the most important aspects of the Medieval Scottish economy. With poor communications, in the early Middle Ages most settlements needed to achieve a degree of self-sufficiency in agriculture. Most farms were operated by a family unit and used an infield and outfield system. Arable farming grew in the High Middle Ages and agriculture entered a period of relative boom between the thirteenth century and late fifteenth century. Unlike England, Scotland had no towns dating from times of Roman Britain. From the twelfth century there are records of burghs, chartered towns, which became major centre of crafts and trade. There are also Scottish coins, although English coinage probably remained more significant in trade, and until the end of the period barter was probably the most common form of exchange. Craft and industry remained relatively undeveloped before the end of the Middle Ages and, although there were extensive trading networks based in Scotland, while the Scots exported largely raw materials, they imported increasing quantities of luxury goods, resulting in a bullion shortage and perhaps helping to create a financial crisis in the fifteenth century. Background Map of available land in early medieval Scotland.. Scotland is roughly half the size of England and Wales and has approximately the same amount of coastline, but only between a fifth and a sixth of the amount of the arable or good pastoral land, under 60 metres above sea level, and most of this is located in the south and east. This made marginal pastoral farming and fishing the key factors in the pre- modern economy.E. Gemmill and N. J. Mayhew, Changing Values in Medieval Scotland: a Study of Prices, Money, and Weights and Measures (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), , pp. 8‚Äì10. Its north Atlantic position means that it has very heavy rainfall, which encouraged the spread of blanket peat bog, the acidity of which, combined with high level of wind and salt spray, made most of the western islands treeless. The existence of hills, mountains, quicksands and marshes made internal communication and conquest extremely difficult.C. Harvie, Scotland: a Short History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), , pp. 10‚Äì11. After the departure of the Romans from Northern Britain, in the fifth century four major circles of influence had emerged in what is now Scotland. In the east were the Picts, whose kingdoms eventually stretched from the river Forth to Shetland; in the west the Gaelic (Goidelic)-speaking people of D√°l Riata with their royal fortress at Dunadd in Argyll, with close links with the island of Ireland, from which they brought with them the name Scots; in the south was the British (Brythonic) Kingdom of Alt Clut, descendants of the peoples of the Roman-influenced kingdoms of \\"The Old North\\"; finally, there were the Angles who had overrun much of southern Britain and held the Kingdom of Bernicia (later the northern part of Northumbria), in the south-east.J. R. Maddicott and D. M. Palliser, eds, The Medieval State: essays presented to James Campbell (London: Continuum, 2000), , p. 48. This situation was transformed from the eighth century when ferocious Viking raids began. Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles eventually fell to the Norsemen.W. E. Burns, A Brief History of Great Britain (Infobase Publishing, 2009), , pp. 44‚Äì5. These threats may have speeded a long term process of gaelicisation of the Pictish kingdoms, which adopted Gaelic language and customs and which probably facilitated a merger of the Gaelic and Pictish crowns. This culminated in the rise of C√≠naed mac Ailp√≠n (Kenneth MacAlpin) in the 840s, which brought to power the House of Alpin, who became the leaders of a combined Gaelic-Pictish kingdom, known as the Kingdom of Alba and later as Scotland.B. Yorke, The Conversion of Britain: Religion, Politics and Society in Britain c.600‚Äì800 (Pearson Education, 2006), , p. 54. From the sixth century, Scotland experienced a process of Christianisation, traditionally seen as carried out by Irish-Scots missionaries, including St Ninian, St Kentigern and St Columba and to a lesser extent those from Rome and England.R. A. Fletcher, The Barbarian Conversion: From Paganism to Christianity (University of California Press, 1999), , pp. 231‚Äì3. However, Gilbert Markus highlights the fact that most of these figures were not church- founders, but were usually were active in areas where Christianity had already become established, probably through gradual diffusion that is almost invisible in the historical record. This would have included trade, conquest and intermarriage.G. Markus, \\"Conversion to Christianity\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 78‚Äì9. There are almost no written sources from which to re- construct the demography of Medieval Scotland. Estimates have been for the early period made of a population of 10,000 inhabitants in D√°l Riata and 80‚Äì100,000 for Pictland, which was probably the largest region.L. R. Laing, The Archaeology of Celtic Britain and Ireland, c. AD 400‚Äì1200 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006), , pp. 21‚Äì2. From the formation of the Kingdom of Alba in the tenth century, to before the Black Death reached the country in 1349, estimates based on the amount of farmable land, suggest that population may have grown from half a million to a million.R. E. Tyson, \\"Population Patterns\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (New York, 2001), pp. 487‚Äì8. Although there is no reliable documentation on the impact of the plague, if the pattern followed that in England, then the population may have fallen to as low as half a million by the end of the fifteenth century.S. H. Rigby, ed., A Companion to Britain in the Later Middle Ages (Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, 2003), , pp. 109‚Äì11. Agriculture In the early Middle Ages, poor transport forced self- sufficiency on small settlements. Lacking the urban centres created under the Romans in the rest of Britain, the economy of Scotland in the early Middle Ages was overwhelmingly agricultural. With a lack of significant transport links and wider markets, most farms had to produce a self-sufficient diet of meat, dairy products and cereals, supplemented by hunter-gathering. Limited archaeological evidence indicates that throughout Northern Britain, farming was done on single homesteads or amongst a small cluster of three or four homes. Each of these probably contained a nuclear family, with kinship relationships likely to be common among neighbouring houses and settlements, reflecting the partition of land through inheritance.A. Woolf, From Pictland to Alba: 789 ‚Äì 1070 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), , pp. 17‚Äì20. A system was adopted that distinguished between the infield, around the settlement, where crops were grown every year, and the outfield, further away, where crops were grown and then left fallow in different years. This would be the predominant system until the eighteenth century.H. P. R. Finberg, The Formation of England 550‚Äì1042 (London: Paladin, 1974), , p. 204. Wester Kittochside. The nature of agricultural production was determined by the land and climate. The cold and wet climate meant that more oats and barley were grown than corn. The evidence of bones indicates that cattle were by far the most important domesticated animal, followed by pigs, sheep and goats, while domesticated fowl were very rare.K. J. Edwards and I.

The early Middle Ages were a period of climatic deterioration, with a drop in temperature and an increase in rainfall, resulting in more land becoming unproductive.. Climate change had a major impact on agriculture in this period and terms emerged to describe different quantities of land. In the period c. 1150 to 1300, warm dry summers and less severe winters allowed cultivation at much greater heights above sea level and made land more productive. Arable farming grew significantly, but was still more common in low-lying areas than in high-lying areas such as the Highlands, Galloway and the Southern Uplands.G. W. S. Barrow, Kingship and Unity: Scotland 1000‚Äì1306 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1989), , p. 12. The main unit of land measurement in Scotland was the ploughgate, also known as the davoch and in Lennox as the arachor.G. W. S. Barrow, Kingship and Unity: Scotland 1000‚Äì1306 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1989), , pp. 12‚Äì15. It may have measured about ,G. W. S. Barrow, Kingship and Unity: Scotland 1000‚Äì1306 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1989), , p. 15. divided into 4 raths.C. J. Neville, Native Lordship in Medieval Scotland: The Earldoms of Strathearn and Lennox, c. 1140‚Äì1365 (Dublin: Four Courts, 2005), , 2005), p. 96. The average amount of land used by a husbandman in Scotland might have been around 26 acres.G. W. S. Barrow, Kingship and Unity: Scotland 1000‚Äì1306 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1989), , p. 18. The ruins of Penshiel Tower, East Lothian, a sheep grange of Melrose Abbey Most farming was based on the lowland fermtoun or Highland baile, settlements of a handful of families that jointly farmed an area notionally suitable for two or three plough teams, allocated in run rigs to tenant farmers. They usually ran downhill so that they included both wet and dry land, helping to offset some of the problems of extreme weather conditions. Most ploughing was done with a heavy wooden plough with an iron coulter, pulled by oxen, which were more effective in heavy soils and cheaper to feed than horses. Obligations to the local lord usually included supplying oxen for ploughing the lord's land on an annual basis and the much resented obligation to grind corn at the lord's mill.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 41‚Äì55. In the late Middle Ages, average temperatures began to reduce again, with cooler and wetter conditions limiting the extent of arable agriculture, particularly in the Highlands.J. Steane, The Archaeology of Medieval England and Wales (London: Taylor & Francis, 1985), , p. 174. The introduction of new monastic orders such as the Cistercians in this period also brought innovations in agriculture. Their monasteries became major landholders, particularly in the Borders. They were sheep farmers and producers of wool for the markets in Flanders. By the late Middle Ages, Melrose Abbey and the Earl of Douglas had about 15,000 sheep apiece, making them among the largest sheep farmers in Europe.K. Jillings, Scotland's Black Death: The Foul Death of the English (Stroud: Tempus, 2006), , pp. 69‚Äì73. New farming methods began to transform agriculture in some parts of the country. Monastic agriculture was organised in granges, farms run by lay brothers of the order.S. M. Foster, \\"The topography of peoples lives: geography to 1314\\", in I. Brown, ed., The Edinburgh History of Scottish Literature: From Columba to the Union, until 1707 (Edinburgh University Press, 2007), , p. 47. Granges were theoretically within 30 miles of the mother monastery, so that those working there could return for services on Sundays and feast days. They were used for variety of purposes, including pastoral, arable and industrial production. However, to manage more distant assets in Ayrshire, Melrose Abbey used Mauchline as a \\"super grange\\", to oversee lesser granges.J. Burton, J. E. Burton, and J. Kerr, The Cistercians in the Middle Ages (Boydell Press) , p. 168. The rural economy appears to have boomed in the thirteenth century and was still buoyant in the immediate aftermath of the Black Death, which reached Scotland in 1349, and may have carried off a third of the population. However, by the 1360s there was a severe falling off in incomes that can be seen in clerical benefices, of between a third and half compared with the beginning of the era, to be followed by a slow recovery in the fifteenth century.S. H. Rigby, ed., A Companion to Britain in the Later Middle Ages (Oxford: Wiley- Blackwell, 2003), , pp. 111‚Äì6. Burghs Burghs established before 1153 Records of burghs, small towns granted legal privileges from the crown, can be found from the eleventh century. Burghs (a term derived from the Germanic word for fortress), developed rapidly during the reign of David I (1124‚Äì53). Up until this point there were no identifiable towns in Scotland. Most of the burghs that were granted charters in his reign probably already existed as settlements. Charters were copied almost verbatim from those used in England,G. W. S. Barrow, Kingship and Unity: Scotland 1000‚Äì1306 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1989), , p. 98. and early citizens, called burgesses, that were usually English or Flemish.A. MacQuarrie, Medieval Scotland: Kinship and Nation (Thrupp: Sutton, 2004), , pp. 136‚Äì40. They were able to impose tolls and fines on traders within a region outside their settlements. Most of the early burghs were on the east coast, and among them were the largest and wealthiest, including Aberdeen, Berwick, Perth and Edinburgh, whose growth was facilitated by trade with the European continent. In the south-west, Glasgow, Ayr and Kirkcudbright were aided by the less- profitable sea trade with Ireland, and to a lesser extent France and Spain. Burghs had unique layouts and economic functions. They were typically were surrounded by a palisade or possessed a castle, and usually had a marketplace, with a widened high street or junction, often marked by a mercat cross (market cross), beside houses for the burgesses and other inhabitants. The foundations of around 15 burghs can be traced to the reign of David I and there is evidence of 55 burghs by 1296. In addition to the major royal burghs, the late Middle Ages saw the proliferation of baronial and ecclesiastical burghs, with 51 being created between 1450 and 1516. Most of these were much smaller than their royal counterparts. Excluded from international trade they mainly acted as local markets and centres of craftsmanship.R. Mitchison, A History of Scotland (London: Routledge, 3rd edn., 2002), , p. 78. In general, burghs probably carried out far more local trading with their hinterlands than nationally or internationally, relying on them for food and raw materials. Manufacture and trade While burghs acted as centres of basic crafts. These included the manufacture of shoes, clothes, dishes, pots, joinery, bread and ale, which would normally be sold to inhabitants and visitors on market days. However, there were relatively few developed manufacturing industries in Scotland for most of this period. By the late fifteenth century, there were the beginnings of a native iron-casting industry, which led to the production of cannon and of the silver and goldsmithing for which the country would later be known. As a result, the most important exports were unprocessed raw materials, including wool, hides, salt, fish, animals and coal, while Scotland remained frequently short of wood, iron and, in years of bad harvests, grain, which was imported in large quantities, particularly from the Baltic ports, through Berwick and Ayr. David I, the first silver coinage to bear a Scottish king's head. Limited sources indicate for the early Middle Ages indicate that there was some trade of luxury goods with continental Europe. For most of the period there are not the detailed custom accounts that exist for England, that can provide an understanding of foreign trade, with the first records for Scotland dating to the 1320s.B. Webster, Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity (St. Martin's Press, 1997), , pp. 122‚Äì3. In the early Middle Ages, the rise of Christianity meant that wine and precious metals were imported for use in religious rites, and there are occasional references of trips to and from foreign countries, such as the incident recorded by Adomn√°n in which St Columba went to a port to await ships bearing news, and presumably other items, from Italy.A. MacQuarrie, Medieval Scotland: Kinship and Nation (Thrupp: Sutton, 2004), , p. 136. Imported goods found in archaeological sites of the period include ceramics and glass, while many sites indicate iron and precious metal working. In the High Middle Ages, although the Scottish economy was still dominated by agriculture and by short-distance, local trade, there was an increasing amount of foreign trade. Coins were replacing barter goods, with Scottish coins being struck from the reign of David I. Mints were established at Berwick, Roxburgh, Edinburgh and Perth, but until the end of the period most exchange was done without the use of metal currency, and English coins probably outnumbered Scottish ones.K. J. Stringer, \\"The Emergence of a Nation-State, 1100‚Äì1300\\", in J. Wormald, ed., Scotland: A History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), , pp. 38‚Äì76. Until the disruption caused by the outbreak of the Wars of Independence in the early fourteenth century, most naval trade was probably coastal and most foreign trade was with England. The wars closed English markets and raised the levels of piracy and disruption to naval trade on both sides. They may have led to an increase in continental trade, and isolated references indicate that Scottish ships were active in Norway and Danzig, and the earliest records from the 1330s indicate that five-sixths of this trade was in the hands of Scottish merchants. Wool and hides were the major exports in the late Middle Ages. From 1327 to 1332, the earliest period for which figures survive, the annual average was 5,700 sacks of wool and 36,100 leather hides. The disruption of the Wars of Independence, which not only limited trade but damaged much of the valuable agricultural land of the Borders and Lowlands, meant that this fell in the period 1341‚Äì42 to 1342‚Äì43 to 2,450 sacks of wool and 17,900 hides. The trade recovered to reach a peak in the 1370s, with an annual average of 7,360 sacks, but the international recession from the 1380s saw a reduction to an annual average of 3,100 sacks. The introduction of sheep-scab was a serious blow to the wool trade from the early fifteenth century. Despite a levelling- off, in the Low Countries there was another drop in exports as the markets collapsed in the early-sixteenth century. Unlike in England, this did not prompt the Scots to turn to large-scale cloth production and only poor-quality rough cloths seem to have been significant. Exports of hides and particularly cod, where the Scots held a decisive advantage in quality over their rivals, appear to have held up much better than wool, despite the general economic downturn in Europe in the aftermath of the Black Death. Exports of hides averaged 56,400 a year from 1380 to 1384, but fell to an average of 48,000 over the next five years and to 34,200 by the end of the century. In the late Middle Ages, the growing desire among the court, lords, upper clergy and wealthier merchants for luxury goods, that largely had to be imported (including fine cloth from Flanders and Italy), led to a chronic shortage of bullion. This, and perennial problems in royal finance, led to several debasements of the coinage, with the amount of silver in a penny being cut to almost a fifth between the late fourteenth century and the late fifteenth century. The heavily debased \\"black money\\", introduced in 1480, had to be withdrawn two years later and may have helped fuel a financial and political crisis.

Williamson Film Company was a short-lived Australian film production company in the 1910s. It was part of the theatrical firm J.C.

Origins In 1914, Williamson's became concerned with reports of American films being made from plays which they were producing in Australia, such as Sealed Orders and The Sign of the Cross. Thus they decided to produce their own films. Production They bought the studios of Lincoln-Cass Films in Melbourne and hired two of its staff, Maurice Bertel and W. J. Lincoln. The unit was put under the control of visiting American actor and director Fred Niblo. He directed two play adaptations for the company. Williamsons then decided to produce original stories, starting with Within Our Gates. These were released in advance of the Niblo films.Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper, Australian Film 1900‚Äì1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production, Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1998, p54 Their films were shot at the site of the Comedy Theatre in Melbourne in Exhibition Street.Marsden, Ralph.

He is credited for opening up the first educational facility for the Santals and a farming colony for the Christian Santals at Jellasore, Orissa(formerly Orissa). He also reduced the language of Santals to writing and introduced a written system of clerical administration and missionary work among Santal tribals‚Äîlaying the foundation of the Bengal-Orissa Baptist Mission among the Bengali people, Odia people, and Santals. Biography He was born to Parley Phillips and Hannah (Crumb) Phillips on 5 January 1812 at Plainfield, New York, US. He was graduated from Hamilton Literary & Theological Institution - later changed its name to Colgate University. While at the university, Amos Sutton from the English General Baptist mission in India visited America and addressed the students of the university and several other schools inspiring Phillips and others to devote their life to missionary service. He was among the first appointees of the Free Will Baptist Foreign Mission Society, organised in 1832 in Maine, USA, for sending missionaries to India at the invitation of the General Baptist missionaries from England, working already in Orissa; accordingly, he was ordained in 1835 as a Minister and missionary to India. He married Mary Spaulding Beede, first wife, on 15 September 1835. At the age of twenty-three, he sailed along with his colleague Eli Noyes [he left India after four years], Amos Sutton, their wives, and several other missionaries [fifteen] arrived Calcutta in 1836 as missionaries under the Free Baptist missionary society in India. He and Eli Noyes were moved from Calcutta and stationed at Majurbhanj, Orissa, where the Baptists from England had already started their work among the Odia. While at the station Sambalpur, his first wife died on 3 November 1837. Sambalpur station was given up in 1828, moved to Balasore station, and later to Jellasore station in 1840. In 1839, he married Mary Ann[e] Grimsditch, second wife from Serampore, but she fell sick and died of fever in August 1940 at Midnapore - now in West Bengal state. Mary Ann Grimsditch bore two twin sons: James and John. He married Hannah M. Cummings, third wife and daughter of Thomas Cummings and Hannah Webster, on 12 February 1841‚ÄîHannah Cummings arrived India on 12 September 1840 and was appointed as a missionary to India at the age of 20 - they were blessed with ten children, where eight of them were born at Jellasore, Orissa. He along with his wife served at Cuttack, Sambalpur, Balasore, Jellasore, and later at Midnapore. He came to India as a missionary to the Santals‚Äî aboriginal tribes predominant in Orissa, West Bengal, Assam, Bihar, and Jharkhand. He devised a writing system for the Santal language using the Bengali script, and translated parts of Gospel of Matthew into Santali in that script. He opened up the first educational facility for the Santals in Jellasore in 1845, established a farming colony of Christian Santals in 1852, and whereby instrumental in introducing written systems over the local vernaculars - essential for clerical administration and missionary activities. He published An Introduction to the Santal Language in 1852, and translated parts of the Bible into the Santali language. He also produced a grammar and dictionary that combined with schools ultimately resulted in village transformation. He returned to the United States in 1855 due to ill-health, and settled on a farm in Midwest - USA. He came back to India in 1865 and opened a teachers training school in 1866. He went back to United States in 1879 after almost 44 years stay in India and died on 9 December 1879. In 1911, the merger of Free Will Baptists with the Northern Baptists brought the oversight of the mission to the American Baptist Foreign Mission Society.

As of 1987, he was the top US ski racer, but was ranked 57th in the world. The Los Angeles Times wrote of his criticism for the lack of competency among the coaches, who were \\"putting exaggerated pressure on the racers\\". He felt that the coaches were not attuned to the steps required to develop relatively inexperienced skiers and were not cognizant of the personal training regimes of individual team members. McGrath finished 10th in the slalom in the 1987 World Championships. McGrath was national champion five times.

It was produced by the Crown Film Unit and funded by the Ministry of Transport. Synopsis The film opens at an emergency telephone exchange, which receives a request for an ambulance once every 3¬Ω minutes. A call is placed about a road traffic accident on Shoreditch Road. An ambulance is dispatched to the scene of the incident. A series of scenes illustrate careless behaviour that could lead to road accidents. This includes a boy running out into the road in front of a car, a drunk man behind the wheel who nearly knocks over a pedestrian, and a cyclist with faulty brakes who runs into the back of a lorry. Two further stories are shown. Mr Smith is driving to work along a familiar route, cutting corners to save time. On one morning, he almost has a collision with a lorry when going around a bend. Miss Jones is a pedestrian who pays little attention to oncoming traffic, assuming that vehicles will always stop to allow her to cross. One day, she is fatally hit by a driver whose brakes are faulty. A man is shown leaving a cinema in which he has been watching the road safety film. He has paid little attention to the film, assuming that \\"accidents only happen to other people\\". As the walks out into the road, the screen cuts to a view of a \\"Get Home Safe and Sound\\" poster, accompanied by the sound of screeching brakes. Reception The Monthly Film Bulletin, the journal of the British Film Institute, considered the film to be \\"one of the best Safety First films for adults\\".

Formation  FoSBR was formed in 1995 as Friends of Severn Beach Railway, to protest against the potential demise of the Severn Beach Line, a single-track branch line in Bristol. Services at the time had been reduced along the line from to , with many services replaced by buses. The first FoSBR action was on 25 September 1995, when a group of protestors met at Avonmouth railway station with buggies and bicycles, to show that buses were not a suitable replacement for trains. The group later changed its name to Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways, allowing it to keep the FoSBR acronym.  Campaigns  = Severn Beach Line = Two Severn Beach Line trains pass at . FoSBR successfully campaigned for an improved service on this line. FoSBR members campaigning at Clifton Down. FoSBR's first campaign was to get a better service on the Severn Beach Line, an important Bristol commuter line connecting to and via Clifton. The line had few services, no service at all on Sundays, and very few trains travelled the entire length of the line to Severn Beach. Following action by FoSBR and a string of protests, Bristol City Council agreed to subsidise a service of at least one train every 45mins in each direction along the line. This continued until 2007 when a 1-hour minimum service was written into the Greater Western passenger franchise. In 2007, the Council unanimously agreed to pay ¬£450,000 per year to fund extra services from May 2008 for three years, which resulted in a 60% increase in passenger numbers along the line, and a 25% year-on-year increase between June 2009 and June 2010. Passenger numbers on the line increased by 90% over the period 2008‚Äì11, and 25% in the period 2010‚Äì11. The Council cut the subsidy paid by half, saying the extra passengers were allowing the line to support itself, which prompted criticism by FoSBR, saying the money should be used to provide evening trains and through services to and . Services along the line run at roughly three trains every two hours between Avonmouth and Temple Meads, with one extending to Severn Beach. FoSBR is campaigning for a half-hourly service, which has become feasible since the restoration of the four-track line between Temple Meads and Filton. FoSBR also campaigned for a Sunday service between Severn Beach and , the success of which was celebrated with a picnic. There are two services each Sunday ‚Äì both terminate at Severn Beach during the summer, but one terminates at Avonmouth outside of summer. FoSBR support the opening of a station to serve the A4 Portway Park & Ride scheme in Shirehampton. They argue that buses often have to deal with heavy traffic on the A4 Portway to reach the city centre, and that a rail link would be quicker and greener. FoSBR have also suggested the Severn Beach Line be electrified as part of the electrification of the Great Western Main Line. They were supported in this by Stephen Williams, the former MP for Bristol West. = Henbury Loop = FoSBR are campaigning for the Henbury Loop Line, a freight line in the north of Bristol which has not seen passenger traffic since the 1960s. This would include the reopening of and railway stations, both of which closed to passengers in 1964. FoSBR suggest this would help services along the Severn Beach Line, allowing a Temple Meads- Avonmouth- service, and also provide services to the north of Bristol generally, the Cribbs Causeway shopping centre, and the redevelopment at Filton Aerodrome. FoSBR say that local councils have committed to a feasibility study into reopening the line. = Filton Bank = FoSBR supported the four-tracking of Filton Bank. Here a CrossCountry service heads south along Filton Bank. The line between and , commonly known as Filton Bank was reduced from four tracks to two in 1984 as a cost-saving measure. It was frequently congested. FoSBR were part of a successful campaign to reinstate this as a four-track railway. These works, which included the rebuilding of a viaduct at Stapleton Road, were completed in 2018.Bristol Upgrades Filton Bank Network Rail = Electrification to Weston-super-Mare = The Great Western Main Line, the major railway between London and Bristol, is due for electrification as part of a major upgrade scheme taking place in the next few years. The entire line between London Paddington, Bristol Temple Meads and was due to be electrified by 2017, as was the line between Temple Meads and Parkway. However, FoSBR are concerned that since the new electric Intercity Express Programme (IEP) trains will not be able to operate beyond Bristol, direct services between London and will be discontinued. FoSBR therefore support the extension of electrification to Weston-super-Mare, and of the Severn Beach Line, to provide passengers with \\"better, more reliable services\\". FoSBR also supported the building of the Filton Triangle depot, Stoke Gifford for Intercity Express Trains, against local opposition. 550 local residents signed a petition against the depot, citing light, noise and water pollution concerns. FoSBR released a joint statement with Daniel Casey of the Green Party and Dave Wood of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers, saying that the residents' concerns were unfounded, noting several methods of noise/light/water pollution prevention that would be used, and also mentioning that the nearby motorways, Filton Airfield and night-time freight trains on the South Wales Main Line would all produce more background noise than the depot would. = MetroWest = FoSBR support the reopening of the Portishead Branch Line to passengers. It is only in use for coal traffic to Royal Portbury Docks. = Portishead Line = FoSBR support the reopening of the Portishead Branch Line to passenger services. The line was closed in the 1960s, but was reopened in the early 2000s for freight trains to serve Royal Portbury Docks. The track beyond is either overgrown or built over.

Adult beetles are in length, and have a punctated elytron at their posterior region. Morphs can occur with red or yellow elytra and four black spots as well as a non-spotted morph. The head is always black.Description Habitat and ecology The beetle feeds mostly on vegetables that are in the cotyledon-stage, such as cucumbers, cucurbits, pumpkin, and squash. It also can be a pest of legumes such as soybean.Legume consumption In early spring, adult beetles emerge to feed on legumes, such as alfalfa, before crops such as soybeans and green beans are available. Multiple generations occur per year depending on growing season length with one generation in northern climates, such as Ontario, one to two generations in the Upper Midwest US, and three generations in the southeastern US. Bean leaf beetle mostly overwinters in woodlot leaf litter, but can also be found in crop fields under soybean debris. Significant mortality can occur below Feeding Larvae feed in the soil on plant roots, while adults consume vegetative tissue on host plants. Bean leaf beetle can also transmit bean pod mottle virus to beans through feeding. Feeding can significantly affect crop yield in some cases, although such damage is highly dependent on beetle densities in a field. Insecticides, such as pyrethroids, and delayed planting dates have been used to manage bean leaf beetle populations, but conditions when such measures are effective vary. Insecticidal seed treatments alone do not increase yield in areas prone to bean leaf beetle feeding or virus transmission.

In the application Felix Tschudi, as chairman of the board, wrote to Stiftelsestilsynet, the Norwegian inspection agency for foundations, that \\"The foundation will conduct business in the form of advisory activities [‚Ä¶]. The advisory enterprise may consist of payable platform of knowhow, and in the form of being an information and agency bureau\\". Notwithstanding, three months later the foreign ministry made the payment of the last (approx. as of April 2012) to the foundation. Funding The funding for the foundation's work was decided before its germinal startup in 2008 to require about (approx. as of April 2012). 6 million has been received as a grant from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and following revelations in the Norwegian media in the spring of 2012 has caused intense scrutiny of the case proceedings and widespread and severe criticism of foreign minister Jonas Gahr St√∏re on grounds of conflict of interest. The issue at hand hinges on the close personal relationship between St√∏re and Felix Tschudi and St√∏re not acknowledging, or even calling for an assessment of, a possible impartiality issue existing. Another 6 million was provided by Tschudi Shipping Company. In April 2012 the foundation announced that it would be running out of money in December 2013. This was said during a visit to the center from the Ministry of Trade and Industry, however the ministry representative emphasized that the center has been supported by the foreign ministry, and that that ministry would support the center until 2013. =Founding Partner program= In October 2009 the board decided to employ a strategy of attracting funds by awarding companies that would contribute a substantial amount (preferably (approx. as of April 2012)) annually over a five-year period the status of \\"Founding Partner\\". This would also entitle these companies to several privileges, such as \\"access to an international political network at a high level\\". Other rights that would be afforded to Founding Partners would be: * Board membership * Opportunity to influence strategy and fiscal priorities * Opportunity to define concrete knowhow and research projects * Early access to information within the foundation's network Companies that were intended as Founding Partners included Wilh. Wilhelmsen and Leif H√∂egh & Co. Although this is documented in the protocol from this board meeting, which was also sent to the foreign ministry, Felix Tschudi has denied that this strategy was ever implemented. He explained that this meeting took place six months following the foundation's establishment and that the board at that time was working to attract more financial contributors to what was in fact a new type of public‚Äìprivate partnership. Tschudi maintained that the protocol from one meeting has been taken out of context, and that this was merely a sketch for how the center could become a permanent organization after the first five years as a project organization. He said that in 2009/2010 there were still few companies with sufficient interests in the North to join in with large sums and the board therefore decided to put the \\"Founding Partners\\" program on ice and instead focus on activities and projects that could visualize the possibilities and the needs for logistics in the North. The disclosure about the Founding Partners program was given in an article in the Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet on April 14, 2012. In it the newspaper also refers to a PowerPoint presentation from February 2010 where both Tschudi Shipping Company and Det Norske Veritas were named as \\"Founding Partners\\".

The Travancore kingdom was located at the southernmost tip of the Indian subcontinent, on its western side. Travancore State Manual was written by V. Nagam Aiya, who was then working as the Dewan Peishcar in Travancore government service. The section on the Fauna of Travancore was contributed by Harold S. Ferguson, Esq. (F. L. N., F. Z. S), who Nagam Aiya describes in the following words: \\"a subject upon which he is an authority having spent nearly the whole of his life in the country, first as a Planter for several years on the Travancore Hills, then as the Guardian of the Princes, then as Commandant of one of the battalions in the Travancore army (Nayar Brigade), and lastly as the Director of the Government Museum and the Public Gardens at Trivandrum.\\"  The writing  V Nagam Aiya mentions that he was commanded by His Highness, the Maharajah of Travancore to write the Travancore State Manual with the simple instruction that it should follow the model of the district manuals of the Madras Presidency, which was under English rule. However, he also mentions that the idea had been ‚Äòbroached‚Äô to him by Dewan T. Rama Row, C.I.E., some fourteen years earlier. At that time, Nagam Aiya had been working as the Dewan Peishcar and District Magistrate of Quilon. Even though, the Dewan did obtain the Maharajah sanction for the project, the Dewan himself retired within a few months, and the matter was dropped. However, the matter was revived by Dewan Mr. K. Krishnaswamy Row, C.I.E., in 1901. Nagam Aiya did a lot of pioneering and original research and work to obtain a lot of information for the preparation of this book. What came out was a book of ‚Äòencyclopaedic nature spread over a space of more than 1820 pages of letter-press‚Äô. It might be correct to think that Nagam Aiya did have this project in his mind, and he must have collected or at least noted down a lot of information much before he started on this work. He started his work on this project as a full-time officer from December 1904.  Contents  The Travancore State Manual is a huge book not only on the antiquity of Travancore, but also of various other features of the place. It is not a just a book on the history of the place. A detailed study and examination of the physical features, geology, Climate, Rainfall, Meteorology, Flora, Fauna, and Archaeology of the place is also there. Detailed writings are there on the geographical location, boundaries, shape and area of the landscape, mountains, plateaus, mountain passes, rivers, canal and backwaters, coastline, ports, shipping facilities, economic geology of the place, climate, rainfall, meteorology, trees, and medicinal plants, flowering and ornamental plants, birds and animals etc., archaeology, architecture, sculpture, coins, inscriptions, forts and military works, ‚ÄòArchaeology‚Äô, ‚ÄòFauna‚Äô, census and population, language, economic condition and various other things are dealt with, in a manner that should astound. There are a number of photographs. Apart from that, there are many pictures of the stone inscriptions collected from various parts of the kingdom. The latter part of the book deals in detail on the history of the localities that were later to be joined together to form Travancore kingdom. The delineation of history starts from the Parasurama legend. This legend is also mentioned in great detail. Then it slowly moves to the times of the Perumals. Mentions about the Malabar and Travancore coasts in the ancient maritime trade records are seen sourced out. Then the history part deals with the ancient kings. There is a mention of a Kurava King, who seems to have been assassinated in a premeditated conspiracy. There is either detailed mention or detailed write-up on such items as early missionaries, neighbouring kingdoms, accounts of Travellers, Portuguese in Malabar and Travancore, Ettuvittial Pillamaar, Marthanda Varma, Zamorin, small kings and kingdoms north of Travancore, small- time rulers of Malabar, the attacks and occupation attempts by Sultan Tipu etc. Velu Thampi Dalawa‚Äôs rebellion is dealt with in details. Even though there is sympathy for the person, in a profound analysis, Nagam Aiya does not find his cause correct or praiseworthy. The proclamation made by Velu Thampi from Kundara is quoted in an elaborate manner. However, a full reading of the same would not find it to be in sync with modern Indian aspirations. QUOTE: Velu Tampi was a daring and clever though unscrupulous man. Rebellion was his forte. END of QUOTE. QUOTE: His favourite modes of punishment were: imprisonment, confiscation of property, public flogging, cutting off the palm of the hand, the ears or the nose, impalement or crucifying people by driving down nails on their chests to trees, and such like, too abhorrent to record here. END of QUOTE. All rulers of Travancore, since the reign of King Marthanda Varma are dealt in reasonable detail. Swathi Thirunal‚Äôs (King Rama Varma) tragic life has been mentioned.  Problems with the contents  From the perspective of modern Indian history and sociology writings, this book has many issues which can make it a disturbance. The main problem is that it is written in a sort of impartial and non-jingoistic manner. The writing of this book has been done from a most impartial manner with regard to caste and social issues. Even though Nagam Aiya is a Brahmin, there has been no attempt to portray any group or castes as above blame. In fact, the detailing is so honest, that not many modern Travancorians would actually like to recommend this book to anyone for a detailed reading. The various false aspirations and claims of the various castes and the tragic sides of their lives have been portrayed with rare honesty. The general culture of official corruption rampant in Travancore bureaucracy, which was more or less hereditary caste- based in mentioned in raw words. The lower castes are also not mentioned in a praiseworthy manner. The next item of jingoistic reproach would be the very obvious support to the English colonial rule. This feature can be felt in many pages dealing with the colonial times in the subcontinent. In the very introduction of the book, Nagam Aiya mentions thus: QUOTE: ultimate success of the English East India Company, our early friendships with them and the staunch support which they in return uniformly gave us through all vicissitudes of fortune, ultimately resulting in a strong bond of political alliance and reciprocal trust and confidence, which assured to us internal security and immunity from external aggression, thus enabling us to achieve the triumphs of peace and good government, until step by step we reached the enviable height of being known as the Model Native State‚Äô of India END OF QUOTE King Marthanda Varma‚Äôs words on his deathbed: QUOTE: That, above all, the friendship existing between the English East India Company and Travancore should be maintained at any risk, and that full confidence should always be placed in the support and aid of that honourable association.\\" END OF QUOTE is also mentioned in the book. These kind of writings found in various parts of the book as well as other items of a similar kind does lend support to the feeling that Nagam Aiya was supportive of the English rulers in the neighbouring Madras Presidency. Another item that can disturb modern folks in south Kerala would be the details given about the social revolts by the lower castes, such as the Ezhava, Shanars, Pulaya, Pariah etc. for social and political freedom. Enough and more historical incidences are mentioned that point to the fact that this social upheaval was the handiwork of the English Missionaries from the London Missionary Society. Beyond that it is seen mentioned that each time such social problems happened, the English officials from Madras exerted pressure on the raja family to give the freedom that was demanded by the lower castes. However, Nagam Aiya does hint that the English rulers did not understand the social issues correctly. That even when the lower castes were given some freedom that had not been traditionally given to them, they used the occasion to go beyond what was allowed, and create social problems and rioting. The history of such incidences could more or less deprive the claims of some lower castes leaders that they were the persons who had spearheaded the social revolution in Travancore. Another item that can be actively disliked is the statement that Malayalam, the erstwhile language of Travancore kingdom, and currently the state language of Kerala, is of very recent origin. QUOTE: Another fact disclosed by the statements already given is that the language of most of the inscriptions is Tamil. The reason here is equally simple. Malayalam as a national language is not very old. Its resemblance to old Tamil is so patent that one could hardly help concluding that Malayalam is nothing more than old Tamil with a good admixture of Sanskrit words. END of QUOTE. In fact, there is a strong hint that the actual antiquity of Travancore is Tamil. Almost all the stone inscriptions mentioned in the book are in Tamil, with a few in Sanskrit. Sultan Tippu (Tipu Sulthaan), who is revered by some as a great freedom fighter, is not mentioned in the superlative.

Life The grandson of Henry Charteris the elder, and a younger son of Henry Charteris the younger, he was educated at the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated M.A. in 1646. From 1651 to 1653 he was living within the bounds of the presbytery of Dalkeith, with or near to Robert Leighton, then minister of Newbattle, who had been a pupil of Charteris's father. In September 1654 Charteris was called to be minister of the parish of Bathans (now Yester), in the adjoining presbytery of Haddington. The church of Scotland was now divided into two sections, the resolutioners and protesters. Charteris, on ordination, said that he had not been a party to the protest: he sympathised with the resolutioners. On the restoration of episcopacy in 1660 Charteris conformed, as did Leighton and the bulk of the Scottish clergy. He was in presbyterian orders, but, except in a few cases in the diocese of Aberdeen, there was no reordination of the parish ministers who had been appointed in the time of presbytery; only, to save the rights of patrons, those who had been admitted to benefices since 1649 were required to obtain presentation from the lawful patron, and collation from the bishop. Charteris had such collation in 1662, and for then for 13 years he remained minister of Yester. Charteris was close to Robert Douglas, Patrick Scougal who was bishop of Aberdeen in 1664, James Nairne, and Gilbert Burnet. He disapproved of actions of the bishops, and of the government. In 1664 Charteris joined with Nairne in a protest against his diocesan's deposing a minister without the consent of his synod; and in 1669, when the Scottish bishops were coerced into voting for an act of supremacy, Charteris was one of the episcopal clergy who thought it went too far, according to Burnet. He did not accept a bishopric. In 1670, however, when Leighton became archbishop of Glasgow, Charteris consented to be one of six preachers whom Leighton sent to preach among the western Whigs in support of an accommodation between presbyterians and episcopalians. In 1675 Charteris was chosen by the town council professor of divinity in the university of Edinburgh When, however, in 1681, under the government of James, Duke of York, a test was imposed, Charteris resigned his chair. He was followed by about 80 clergy. Three years later he visited Archibald Campbell, 1st Duke of Argyll, and prayed with him on the day of his execution. In 1687 James II dispensed with the test, and in September 1688 Charteris was instituted to the parish of Dirleton in East Lothian. He took the oath of allegiance to William III and Mary II, and was there to 1697. But he showed himself independent, as before. In 1697 he retired on an allowance from his benefice, and died in Edinburgh in 1700, suffering from the stone. He did not marry. Works On the Difference between True and False Christianity (1703), and On the Corruption of this Age (1704) were published after his death. In the latter work (republished by Robert Foulis, Glasgow, 1761) Charteris condemns the preaching at the celebration of the Lord's Supper, and pleads for the restoration of the public reading of the Bible in the services of the Church of Scotland. The catalogue of Scottish divines in James Maidment's Catalogues was drawn up by Charteris for his friend Sir Robert Sibbald.

He played for the New York Yankees, Tampa Bay Rays, and Atlanta Braves. Early life Whitley graduated from Ranburne High School in Ranburne, Alabama, in 2007. He attended Southern Union State Community College, and then transferred to Troy University. The Yankees drafted Whitley out of Troy in the 15th round, with the 475th overall selection, of the 2010 Major League Baseball draft. Professional career =Minor leagues= Whitley made his professional debut as a relief pitcher for the Staten Island Yankees of the Class A-Short Season New York‚ÄìPenn League.

In 2011, Whitley pitched for the Tampa Yankees of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League and the Trenton Thunder of the Class AA Eastern League, recording seven saves in 42 appearances. In 2012, he pitched in middle relief for the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees of the Class AAA International League. Returning to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre in 2013, Whitley had a 3‚Äì2 win‚Äìloss record and three saves in 29 appearances, five of which were starts.

On the mound, he pitched 4.2 innings while issuing 2 hits and 2 walks while striking out 4. At the plate, he recorded his first career hit off of Jacob deGrom, who also got a hit and made his MLB debut in the same game. Whitley took the no-decision as the Yankees would go on to win against the Mets 1‚Äì0. It was the first Yankee game since 1908 in which both starting pitchers were making their MLB debut. Whitley surrendered his first major league home run on June 12 to Logan Morrison of the Seattle Mariners. On June 23, 2014 against the Blue Jays, Whitley surrendered 8 runs in innings pitched, leading to his first MLB loss as the Yankees lost 3‚Äì8 to the Blue Jays. In 24 games (12 starts), he finished the year 4‚Äì3 with a 5.23 ERA.  2015  Whitley started the 2015 season with Scranton Wilkes/Barre. He was called up on April 27, and made his first start of the season the next day. After pitching through elbow pain, Whitley exited a start on May 14 in the second inning, and was diagnosed with a tear in his ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) in his elbow. Whitley had Tommy John surgery to repair the UCL, and it prematurely ended his 2015 season. In 4 starts, he went 1-2 with a 4.19 ERA. =Tampa Bay Rays=  2016  Whitley was claimed on waivers by the Tampa Bay Rays on November 20, 2015.

After obtaining his bachelor's degree in 1971, Bartels continued his studies at the Ghana School of Law in order to become a professional lawyer. In 1979, Bartels first contested for a seat in the Parliament of Ghana, but was defeated by a People's National Party candidate. In 1992, Bartels again stood for election in Agona West constituency, but withdrew after his party boycotted the 1992 election due to alleged electoral fraud. In 1996, Bartels was elected MP for the Ablekuma North constituency. He was the Minister for Works and Housing from 2001 -2004.

He invented the Khmer typewriter keyboard in 1952. He had lived in exile in Paris, France, from 1970 until his death in 2008. He died at the age of eighty-three at the hospital of Montmorency in the outskirts of Paris after suffering from a chronic illness. In modern Cambodia, Keng Vannsak is known for being one of the influential figures for the next generations of Cambodian scholars and intellectuals. He left behind him a legacy in literature, including two drama plays, short stories, many poems and his research from the 1940s. Politically a leftist, he was a member of the radical Democratic Party, and stood unsuccessfully as its MP candidate in the 1955 elections. He was also a friend and mentor of Saloth Sar (later known as Pol Pot) while both of them were studying in Paris. Biography Keng Vannak was born in a small village in Kampong Cham province on 19 September 1925, the same year when Pol Pot was born. Vannsak mentored Pol Pot while both were in France. Both of them appeared to share an opinion on \\"original Khmer\\", considering Buddhism and Hinduism had contaminated the Khmer original culture. After obtaining his baccalaureate in Philosophy in 1946 in Phnom Penh, Vannsak continued his studies in Paris on a scholarship and worked as a Khmer-language assistant at the National School of Modern Eastern Languages (Ecole nationale des Langues Orientales). During his studies, he spent two years teaching Khmer language at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London. He later married Suzanne Colleville, a French national, who shared with him a passion for Eastern languages. She held Diplomas in the Cambodian, Lao, and Thai languages, and also obtained a degree in Physical Science at the University of Caen, as revealed by the (unpublished) writing of Khing Hoc Dy, a former student as well as friend of Keng Vannsak. Career In 1952, he returned to Cambodia with his wife and a bachelor's degree which he obtained at the Faculty of Literature and Human Science University of Paris in 1951. He later worked as a teacher at the prestigious Lyc√©e Sisowath in Phnom Penh, and decided to stay there from 1952 to 1958. The most radical of his friends began distancing themselves from him. He covered for the president of the Cambodian Students Association when the group was invited to attend \\"youngsters' world peace celebrations\\" in Berlin, but was eventually asked not to go with the group just before they were due to leave. \\"Half a century later, Vannsak still fulminated\\" at the simple idea of it, Philip Short says. Keng Vannsak explained to him that the other ones wanted to get rid of him. Short quoted him: \\"They knew that I was not the tough kind like them. I thought too much. I was not a stubborn person and did not act with fanaticism nor like an extremist. Ieng Sary, a former high school classmate who later became Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Khmer Rouge government himself told me later: 'You are too sensitive. You will never be a politician. In order to make politics, you have to be tough. You will not get there, brother. You are too sentimental'\\".  Beliefs  Strongly opposed to the Cambodian monarchy, Vannsak was also known for his role as a mentor to Saloth Sar, later known as Pol Pot, who ruled Cambodia from 1975 to 1979. During Pol Pot's rule of Cambodia, at least two million people died from execution, starvation and overwork. =A mentor for Cambodian students in Paris= Keng Vannsak became one of the key figures of the Cambodian student community in Paris. As described by historian Philip Short in his book titled \\"Pol Pot ‚Äì Anatomy of a Nightmare\\", during the winter of 1950, more exclusive student meetings took place several times every month at Keng Vannsak's flat in Paris ‚Äúto discuss political issues and more precisely about the future of Cambodia, a country which, for the first time, was directly affected by the war in Vietnam‚Äù. The historian explains that the meetings was the beginning of Saloth Sar's political training and more involvement into the Khmer political affairs. Philip Short also details that at that time communism was not their main concern, and recalls that Vannsak himself was more aware of political reality than most of his fellow-students. Vannsak appeared to offend a young Frenchwoman of the high bourgeoisie by offering her, a year before, to go and spend the afternoon at the F√™te de l'Humanit√©, organised by the French Communist Party. He said: \\"I had no idea it was a Communist meeting. I thought it was just a celebration for humanity, that's all.\\" Vannsak's studies group tried to stay away from the political labels as most of the members prefer themselves to be part of a progressist trend. =Opposition to Khmerization program= Vannsak and France-oriented scholars opposed the Khmerization program invented by Chuon Nath, and chose another way for language they transformed French words into the Khmer vocabulary using the same pronunciation as much as possible with the Khmer alphabet. Legacy In 1952, he invented the Khmer typewriter keyboard. After his death, Cambodia's Prime Minister Hun Sen expressed his regret, saying Cambodia lost a well-known intellectual. Before his death, Keng Vansak wrote a letter to Premier Hun Sen to let him know that he wanted to visit Cambodia after many years spent abroad since the 1970s. His very close friends said that Vannsak had a very last wish to have his ashes buried inside his mother's stupa in Cambodia.

Teachings Nirmal Baba is best known for his televised Samagams (congregations), The Third Eye of Nirmal Baba, which have attracted audiences of thousands seeking spiritual guidance and faith healing. The Samagams began gaining popularity in 2011 and by 2012 they'd been broadcast on over 30 major television channels and Nirmal Baba had amassed an online following of around 500,000. He often gives seemingly very simple solutions to people looking for guidance: his advice has included stocking fridges with cold drinks, eating pani poori, giving food to the poor and buying a new briefcase. One of his supporters (a professor of psychology at Delhi University), has said that she believed \\"he had some sort of extra-sensory perception\\" and \\"he was performing a positive mental health role\\". Controversy As well as serval followers, Nirmal Baba has many detractors who have criticised the high ticket price of his events and accused him of taking advantage of troubled followers, paying audience shills to ask prearranged questions, and offering \\"absurd or illogical solutions\\" to his disciples. And in 2017 the Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (All India Akhara Council) called for him to be boycotted, amongst a list of \\"fake Babas\\". Nirmal Baba has rebuffed these claims stating \\"There are many groups that do not like that I have reached the heights I have achieved,\\" and that \\"some vested interests then started a campaign to malign [me] by planting people [‚Ä¶] to file false cases and entangle [me in] legal cases.\\". One former follower who challenged Nirmal Baba for giving dietary advice that exasperated his health problems, was later charged with attempting to blackmail him. Personal Life Nirmaljit Singh Narula was born to a Sikh family in 1952 and migrated to India from Pakistan after the partition. Before becoming a spiritual leader, he had business ventures including a garment factory and a mining operation in Jharkhand. In 2014 he was charged with tax evasion in relation to the donations made by his followers.

(√âdouard Manet, Courses au Bois de Boulogne, 1872). Le Tout- Paris (\\"everyone in Paris\\") is a French expression referring to the fashionable and affluent elite of the city, who frequent fashionable events and places, and establish trends in upper-class culture. It is equivalent to the \\"jet set\\" elsewhere.  History  A dinner for fashion designer Charles Jourdan at the trendy Plaza Ath√©n√©e hotel in Paris, 1962. The popular understanding of fashionable Tout Paris has grown to include celebrities such as actor Brigitte Bardot, here in Saint-Tropez on the French Riviera, 1963. The expression tout-Paris was used in the 17th century to refer to \\"high society\\" among the aristocratic inhabitants of the city of Paris. It was used in 1660 by Nicolas Boileau in his Satires to refer to the influential members of Paris society who made Pierre Corneille's play El Cid popular, in the famous sentence, \\"In vain, a minister sought support against El Cid‚ÄîTout Paris supported Chimene in love with Rodrigue\\"Boileau, Satire IX s: Satire IX (Boileau) at Wikisource Boileau also used the expression in Chant III: \\"Where tout Paris as a crowd bears its sufferings\\". Voltaire and Jean le Rond D'Alembert also used the expression in their correspondence. The current use of the expression tout-Paris dates from the Belle Epoque era of 19th century Paris. Historian Anne Martin-Fugier dates it to the beginning of the 19th century, when in the aftermath of the French Revolution and the rise of Napoleon, when the non-aristocratic elites of the city began playing a role at the top of the city's affluent culture, forming a new social class.Anne Martin-Fugier, La vie √©l√©gante ou la formation du Tout-Paris, 1815-1848, Fayard, 1990 A group made up of writers, politicians, bankers and prominent artists, this community lived in fashionable neighbourhoods, went to the theatre, and attended receptions at embassies. It also embodied a certain idea of Parisians' \\"good taste\\" (\\"bon go√ªt\\"), setting trends with its pastimes, such as horse racing and holidays at the seaside. The activities of Tout-Paris were noted in the mass media. One article in Le Gaulois, from August 24, 1895, titled \\"Mondanit√©s : Paris hors Paris\\" (Worldly events: Paris outside of Paris), noted that composer Camille Saint-Sa√´ns arrived at the coastal resort of Dieppe (Seine-Maritime) and gave a detailed list of other noteworthy social figures also present in the town : It is tout Paris, that can be seen : Count and Countess Louis de Talleyrand-P√©rigord, M. Josselin de Rohan, Mme Madeleine Lemaire, M. Marcel Proust et M. Reynaldo Hahn, who are the hosts of the eminent artist. Evoking the year 1841, poet Charles Baudelaire saw in Tout- Paris above all the passionate followers of literature and poetry: During this time, tout Paris was made up of this elite group given the role of fashioning others' opinions, and who, when a poet is born, are always the first to be notified..Charles Baudelaire, L'Art romantique (posthume), 1869 Online edition in French at Gallica During the Belle √âpoque, Tout-Paris became a sort of club with its own rules. In 1901 the Annuaire du Tout Paris (Tout Paris Annual) appeared, counting writer Marcel Proust among its most devoted readers. Created in 1903, the Bottin mondain (Directory of the High Society) in fact presented only a list of Parisian personalities. Le Tout-Paris was associated with particular fashionable places in the city, such as the restaurant (Maxim's, the large urban forest the Bois de Boulogne, Deauville, and so on, defining trends, giving an artist or writer their blessing, making or unmaking the reputation of a politician. Beginning in the 1950s, Tout-Paris became increasingly associated with personalities connected with certain trendy nightclubs, such as R√©gine, creating notable discos where celebrities could be seen, among them Fran√ßoise Sagan, Jean-Claude Brialy, Jacques Chazot, Fran√ßoise Giroud, Yves Saint-Laurent, and so on.  Tout-Paris today  Today, the expression is sometimes used to refer to subgroups of Paris culture's elite (the \\"literary tout-Paris\\", the \\"political tout-Paris\\", and so on), somewhat losing its original meaning, now referring to a broader group of arts personalities, athletes, media figures, or politicians covered in the popular media. Their attendance is covered at events such as concerts, galas, premiers, art gallery vernissages and nightclubs in the capitol. With global travel and fashion, it is often used interchangeably with the global jet set of trendsetters. The rise of the tabloid press in the 20th century, and the blending of entertainment and current events news in publications such as Paris Match, has added to this public perception of Parisian celebrity.

A tribute to classical music and Carnegie Hall, the film features appearances by some of the prominent music figures of 20th century performing within the legendary concert hall. Based on a story by silent movie actress Seena Owen, Carnegie Hall follows the life of Irish immigrant Nora Ryan who arrives in America just as the grand concert hall is christened in 1891, and whose life is intertwined with the performers, conductors, aspiring artists and humble employees who call it home. The plot serves as a thread to connect the music performances. Plot A mother (Marsha Hunt) wants her son (William Prince) to grow up to be a pianist good enough to play at Carnegie Hall. The son would prefer to play jazz with Vaughn Monroe's orchestra. But Mama's wishes prevail and the son appears at Carnegie Hall as the composer-conductor- pianist of a modern trumpet concerto, with Harry James as the soloist.

Building Online Marketplaces, Anthill Magazine, retrieved April 4, 2012 History The company was founded in 2006 by Martin Hosking, Peter Styles and Paul Vanzella after raising $2 million in investor capital. On 16 June 2011, Hosking left his position at Aconex to focus on his job as CEO of Redbubble. In March 2014, it was reported that 51,900 artists have successfully sold their creations on Redbubble generating more than A$15 million in earnings. At the time it was estimated that eight million unique viewers visited the site every month. In 2015, Redbubble raised A$15.5 million in funding from various investors including Melbourne-based Acorn Capital and London based investor Piton Capital. Since February 2015, Redbubble has been running an artist residency program at their Melbourne office. The purpose of the program is to enable selected artists with the opportunity to produce artwork at Redbubble artist studio while collaborating with other artists. The company was listed on the Australian Stock Exchange in May 2016. In January 2017, Hosking reported 450,000 active artists and 10 million site visits per month. In the last ten years, almost 7 million people have bought products from the site, generating $70 million earned by artists. In June 2018, it was announced that Hosking would be stepping down as CEO. COO Barry Newstead, who has been with the company since 2013, would take over as CEO in August 2018. In October 2018, Redbubble acquired US-based TeePublic for A$57.7 million.  Controversy  In June 2011, The Register and The Age reported that artists on Redbubble were offering T-shirts images taken from the satirical online comic strip Hipster Hitler. Some Redbubble users perceived the comic and its products as antisemitic, pressuring PayPal to investigate whether it violated their policy. In May 2011 Arnold Bloch Leibler, a law firm with connections to the Australian Jewish community, severed their business relationship with Redbubble for \\"promoting Nazism\\".Apostolou, Natalie (3 June 2011). \\"Lawyers Dump Redbubble Over Hitler Hiptsters\\". The Register, retrieved April 23, 2012. Both Redbubble's CEO, Martin Hosking, and the head of B'nai B'rith's Anti Defamation Commission recognized Hipster Hitler as parody but noted that it was being misunderstood ‚Äì this was due in part to the limited context of the merchandise and stories that some hate groups had allegedly praised Hipster Hitler ‚Äì and discussed how best to deal with such work. Three weeks later on 5 June 2011, The Age reported that Hosking, who had originally defended the work as free speech, removed the entire Hipster Hitler merchandise line and said the guidelines would be changed to \\"prohibit parodies of genocide and the Holocaust, as well as other material likely to cause deep offence\\". Such a statement does not appear literally or clearly semantically in Redbubble's community guidelines. At the same time he said it was hard to take a nuanced approach to removing Hipster Hitler merchandise due to the nature of the controversy. Hosking's decision to pull Hipster Hitler's line was applauded by the Simon Wiesenthal Center as being responsive to both artists and the Jewish community. On 12 and 15 June 2011 articles by digital media company Ninemsn and news web site Stuff.co.nz reported that artists on Redbubble were selling baby clothes featuring pictures of Hitler, Osama bin Laden and serial killers Ivan Milat, Ted Bundy and Charles Manson. According to a 9 September 2011 article in the Herald Sun more than 100 children's items remained on sale, some with \\"four-letter swear words\\" and drug images.O'Brien, Susie (9 September 2011) \\"Anger at Porn Images on Baby Clothes\\", Herald Sun, retrieved April 23, 2012 In 2012 the Los Angeles Times reported that due to outrage over the death of Trayvon Martin, artists on Redbubble were offering a hoodie with a version of a \\"Neighborhood Watch\\" sign, which warns, darkly, \\"We immediately murder all suspicious persons\\".

Nigel Caple was born on the Isle of Wight. He studied art at Portsmouth College of Art and the Department of Fine Art at Portsmouth Polytechnic (now the University of Portsmouth), where he received a BA Honours Degree in Fine Art. While at Portsmouth Polytechnic he studied with the painter Miles Richmond. After graduation he continued to be tutored by Miles at various locations including Ronda in Spain, Morley College in London and The Motor House in North Yorkshire. Miles was arguably one of David Bomberg‚Äôs closest students. Nigel‚Äôs relationship with Miles continued until Miles‚Äô death in 2008. Between 1987-8 Nigel worked on a series of paintings and drawings based upon Ryde Pier on the Isle of Wight. In 1988 Nigel began painting and drawing the historic Shinjo Matsuri Festival of Northern Japan. These drawings and paintings culminated in a touring exhibition that was part of the UK‚Äôs prestigious Japan Festival 1991.Exhibition catalogue, Nigel Caple: celebrating Japan, 1991, British Council Library, Barcode: R187711456. In 1992 he was invited by cultural authorities in Japan to create and coordinate an exhibition. The subsequent show was entitled An Exhibition of Works by Eight British Artists (1919-1992). The exhibition was held in Northern Japan. The artists featured were David Bomberg, Marion Milner, Harry Thubron, Miles Richmond, John Rodrigues, Ann Kiernan, David Seaton and Nigel Caple. In 1994 Nigel started a series of drawings and paintings of interiors, as a homage to his parents and to a friend, Marion Milner, leading to an exhibition called Life's Dreams. Between 1995-6 he painted alongside Miles Richmond at the South Bank University in London. Miles was continuing his studies in relation to his millennium celebration painting, a panoramic view of London as seen from the roofs of South Bank University. During 1996-9 Nigel helped conceive and coordinate a group show called Bridges. This was The Daiwa Foundation‚Äôs Anglo-Japanese Visual Arts Touring Show, which toured the UK, Europe and Japan.Exhibition catalogue, Bridges The Daiwa Foundation Anglo-Japanese Visual Arts Touring Show, 1996. .Exhibition catalogue, Bridges The Daiwa Foundation Anglo-Japanese Visual Arts Touring Show, 1998. . From 1997 he has been working on a series of paintings and drawings of London cityscapes. Nigel travelled along the T≈çkaid≈ç Road in Japan between 1998 and 2000 in order to make drawings of the views once used by Utagawa Hiroshige in his woodblock series entitled The Fifty- three Stations of the T≈çkaid≈ç. These drawings formed the basis for a series of paintings and culminated in a touring exhibition and a lecture series during 2001-2002. Locations included Hertfordshire University and The British Museum.

Keene was a Victorian designer of costumes, props, mechanical effects and scenery for plays and pantomimes on the London stage, with a strong sense of wit and a special feeling for animals. He contributed some notable props for the first cycle of Wagner's Ring at Bayreuth. He was also an artist and in his earlier career a manufacturer and inventor of building materials. Keene's cement, a type of hard plaster for internal use, perpetuates his name. Keene achieved his theatrical distinction despite being severely or almost totally deaf. Probably for that reason he was never a public figure, and he died in penury.  Early career  Keene was born in Birmingham, where his father John Williams Keene may have run a business connected with the arms trade. Drawings he made while visiting London in 1828 show that his artistic abilities and visual sense of humour were already well developed. By 1834, when he married Mary Garner Morgan, a widow, at St Mary's, Lambeth, he had settled in London and was already probably working in the cement industry, as he described himself as a cement merchant the following year, when he had an address off the Waterloo Road, while two years later he was working for a manufacturer at Nine Elms and looking for premises of his own.The Times, 28 October 1837. The trade was then developing rapidly along the south bank of the Thames and Keene seems to have been interested in exploring the use of cement for modelling and sculpture. In 1838 Keene and John Danforth Greenwood, giving their address as Belvedere Road, Lambeth, patented the invention now known as Keene‚Äôs cement. This was a kind of hard plaster formed by heating a gypsum-based compound to over 170 ¬∞C. According to the patent application, it was to be used for ‚Äòthe purpose of producing Ornamental Surfaces‚Äô.The Repertory of Patent Inventions, new series, vol. 10, June‚ÄìDecember 1838, pp. 229‚Äì232. Though the invention was soon taken up, the patentees seem to have made little money from it, and in 1843 Greenwood, a physician by training, emigrated to New Zealand. Between about 1841 and 1851 Keene ran a business under his own name at Vauxhall Walk as a manufacturer of terracotta.Post Office Directories. This was still then an experimental trade, covering different processes and purposes. Keene seems to have avoided the developing market for terracotta drains, bricks or building materials, concentrating instead on mosaic-making and other artistic features. He supplied capitals for columns at the Reform Club for Sir Charles Barry, and exhibited samples of mosaic pavement made from terracotta and similar materials at the Great Exhibition in 1851.  Work for the London stage  In 1852 Keene changed direction completely and began working as a designer of sets and costumes for the London stage, notably for the celebrated Drury Lane Christmas pantomimes.The Era, 24 December 1854. He had always been fascinated with the stage and with caricature. If, as seems likely, he was already severely deaf, this new career may have been easier for him to manage than an independent business. But Keene was not money-minded, and it is probable he took up the new work out of love for the theatre. For the rest of his life he lived at modest addresses in Clapham, and at one point (1864) he was declared bankrupt. Keene‚Äôs stage sobriquet Dykwynkyn, a comic shortening of his name, is first recorded in connection with his costumes for the 1854 Drury Lane pantomime. That was how he was invariably known thereafter. Dykwynkyn‚Äôs great speciality were the large masks or ‚ÄòBig Heads‚Äô very popular with mid-Victorian pantomime audiences. Examples of his charming drawings for these and other fantasy devices are preserved in the Victoria & Albert Museum, at Harvard, and elsewhere. They were modelled in cramped back rooms at the back of Drury Lane Theatre, where Keene had a workshop.Belgravia, January 1867, pp. 359‚Äì64. He also superintended the ‚Äòjuvenile f√™tes‚Äô held at the Crystal Palace in 1858‚Äì9, when a monster plum pudding ‚Äòoutdoing in its dimensions a Great-Western turntable‚Äô was displayed, with creatures dancing upon it.The Era, 26 December 1858, 2 January 1859. Keene‚Äôs range went well beyond comedy. He was involved in several ambitious archaeological reconstructions of scenery and costumes, such as the Egyptian drama Nitocris staged at Drury Lane in 1855, but they never brought him the success of the pantomimes. He also designed the monument in Kensal Green Cemetery to the pantomime clown Richard Flexmore (1862).The Era, 9 February 1872.  ‚ÄòFauna‚Äô for The Ring  Keene left Drury Lane in the 1870s during the management of F. B. Chatterton, and set up as a freelance stage designer and modeller with a workshop behind his own house at Milton Street, Wandsworth Road, Clapham (not Wandsworth, as has persistently been repeated). One episode stands out during this last stage of his career, when he was commissioned to supply mechanical animals for the first cycle of Richard Wagner‚Äôs Ring at Bayreuth in 1876. The background to this prestigious commission is peculiar. Wagner had strong ideas about stage effects in his operas, but often wavered between realism and suggestion. In this case he appears to have disregarded the caution of Richard Fricke, his main adviser on staging the Ring, and insisted on a number of realistic mechanical props for scenes featuring mythical animals. Alfred Forman, Wagner‚Äôs first English translator, though not one of his intimates, seconded by the Anglo-German conductor Edward Dannreuther, then urged the skills of Dykwynkyn as the craftsman best able to make the monstrous dragon into which Fafner is transformed in the second act of Siegfried. As far as is known, Wagner had never seen any of Dykwynkyn‚Äôs creations on his visits to London. Yet Keene was commissioned, probably at short notice, to make not only the dragon but also a bear, a magpie and an ousel for Siegfried, a car with rams for Fricka in Die Walk√ºre, and sacrificial beasts and a pair of ravens for G√∂tterd√§mmerung. The snake into which Alberich is changed in Siegfried also came from England and was probably Dykwynkyn‚Äôs too, but that is less certain. By late July 1876, three weeks before the cycle began, only the car and parts of the dragon had arrived in Bayreuth, despite frequent visits by Dannreuther to Dykwynkyn‚Äôs Clapham workshop. Most of the missing parts turned up just in time, but Fafner‚Äôs neck-joint arrived too late (a canard repeated by Ernest Newman claimed that it was sent to Beirut instead of Bayreuth). The German technicians had to sew on a clumsy and unconvincing temporary neck. This caused the first audience to be amused rather than awed by the dragon, and to cheer when Siegfried slew it and put it out of its misery, to Wagner‚Äôs fury. In general Dykwynkyn‚Äôs creations for the Ring, clever and fantastic though they certainly were, were poorly received. Exotic pantomime props were unsuitable for Wagnerian mythic opera, as Richard Fricke had realized immediately the dragon arrived (‚ÄòInto the deepest junk room with the wretched thing! Get rid of it!‚Äô). Nothing was heard of the props after the opening cycle.The main source for the story of the Dykwynkyn props for Bayreuth is an article by W. Courthope Forman in Daily Telegraph, 12 July 1930. See also Ernest Newman, The Life of Richard Wagner, vol. 4, 1947, pp. 458‚Äì9, and Patrick Carnegy, Wagner and the Art of the Theatre, 2006, pp. 88‚Äì90. Misconceptions in these earlier treatments are clarified in David Cormack, \\"Our English Monster-man\\", The Wagner Journal VII/3, 2013, pp. 4‚Äì25.  Death  By the early 1880s Keene‚Äôs business had collapsed. He was probably already ill and certainly poor. In his final years, living at Hanbury Road, Battersea, close to his previous address, he was paralysed, bedridden, and relied on assistance from a theatrical charity. He died in the local workhouse infirmary on 28 November 1887 and was buried at the charity‚Äôs expense at Brookwood Cemetery near Woking. According to an obituary in The Era, ‚Äòthrough no fault of his own, his later life was saddened by great reverses of fortune, and he patiently endured to the last his many afflictions‚Äô.The Era, 3 December 1887. In these last years he seem to have been cared for by a niece who was left ‚Äòalmost destitute‚Äô.The Era, 28 July 1888.

The museum possesses countless objects and pieces of major artistic and historical value that make up their collections of garments, fabrics and jewellery. Regarding their collection of clothes, the museum allows you to take a journey through the history of textiles, from the 16th century right up to the modern day. The museum's collections include Coptic, Hispano-Arab, Gothic and Renaissance fabrics, as well as embroidery, a section on lacework and a collection of prints.

Palau Reial de Pedralbes  Palau Reial de Pedralbes The palace has its origins in the old Masia (mas or farmer's house) de Can Feliu, from the 17th century.Jardins del Palau de Pedralbes The corresponding land was acquired by the count Eusebi G√ºell, along with the neighbouring Can Cui√†s de la Riera. Together they formed the Finca G√ºell, an extensive parcel of land (30,000 m2). The Can Feliu building was remodeled by the architect Joan Martorell i Montells, who built a Caribbean-style small palace, together with a Gothic-style chapel and surrounded by magnificent gardens. Later the building remodeling was given to Antoni Gaud√≠, together with the construction of a surrounding perimeter wall and the side entry pavilions. Gaud√≠ also partially designed the gardens surrounding the palace, placing two fountains and a pergola and planted many Mediterranean plants like palm trees, cypress trees, magnolias, pine trees and eucalyptus. The Font d'H√©rcules (Hercules fountain) still exists today on site, restored in 1983;Font H√©rcules by Gaud√≠ it has a bust of Hercules on top of a pillar with Catalonia's shield and a spout in the shape of a Chinese dragon.

History  The history of the Museu T√®xtil i d'Indument√†ria dates back to 1883, when the Barcelona City Council acquired its first collections of textiles with the objective of creating a monographic museum. For the greater part of the 20th century, the collections of fabrics, clothing and lacework were split between various museums. In 1961, the Museu T√®xtil opened on the premises of the old Hospital de la Santa Creu. In 1968, the doors of the Museu de les Puntes (Lacework Museum) were opened at the Palau de la Virreina and then, in 1969, at the Palau del Marqu√®s de Li√≥, the Museu d'Indument√†ria was born, thanks to the generous donation of Manuel Rocamora. It was not until 1982 that the three museums were united to become the Museu T√®xtil i d'Indument√†ria. In 1993, the Museu T√®xtil i d'Indument√†ria opened a new permanent exhibition to showcase its historic collection of fabrics and clothing, and since 2003 has dedicated its exhibitions to proposals concerned with the culture of fashion. Finally, in 2008, the museum transferred its collections to the Palau de Pedralbes which led to the opportunity to create a new presentation of the collection: The Dressed Body that demonstrates how clothing has modified body image from the 16th century to the present day. Currently, the Museu T√®xtil i d'Indument√†ria in Pedralbes share its location with Museu T√®xtil i d'Indument√†ria and the Gabinet de les Arts Gr√†fiques, an office of Graphic Arts, with which it forms part of the Disseny Hub Barcelona. These collections are expected to move to a new headquarters being built in the Pla√ßa de les Gl√≤ries of Barcelona.

Since ancient times, men and women have altered the form and appearance of their body through hairstyles, jewellery, tattoos and, above all, garments. Each period's way of dressing has to do with moral, social and aesthetic codes.Dressing the body Fashion imposes ideals of beauty. Silhouettes and volumes are altered ‚Äì nature gives way to artifice. The exhibition, Dressing the body, depicts the transformations the body has undergone, prompted by changes in clothing involving five different actions, which tend to either confine or liberate it. Dressing the body has been nominated as one of the 116 Touristic Icons of Catalunya, an initiative that identifies the most significant symbols and manifestations that represent the Catalan visual identity. The collection was prepared by the Ag√®ncia Catalana de Turisme, the Direcci√≥ General de Turisme and Artesania Catalunya of CCAM, the Foment de les Arts i el Disseny (FAD), the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya (MNAC) and the Institut d'Estudis Catalans (IEC).Explore 116 Touristic icons from Catalunya (The Dressed Body, number 86, page 352)  Temporary exhibits  = What to Wear? Maria Brillas' Wardrobe by Pedro Rodr√≠guez = The act of getting dressed is more involved than what it seems at first sight. Disseny Hub Barcelona reflects on self- identity in terms of the question, What to wear? the title of an exhibition comprising some fifty pieces selected from the Maria Brillas endowment, all of them made by Pedro Rodr√≠guez, a great master of 20th-century haute couture. By re-creating the everyday act of standing in front of the wardrobe and deciding on the garments we wish to wear, this display aims to focus on contemporary issues by providing a rare insight into the role of garments in constructing our own identity. It also explores the various factors we consider when creating our image, as well as the autobiographical nature our wardrobe is likely to take on during our lifetime. The exhibits on display are part of a collection donated by Hilda Bencomo, Maria Brillas' granddaughter, to the Museu T√®xtil i d'Indument√†ria, which comprises 341 pieces, 183 dresses and 158 accessories. The ensemble re-creates the rich, original world of references which Pedro Rodr√≠guez used to conceptualise his oeuvre, much of which belongs to the mainstream of Spanish fashion design. His brilliant career, spanning Barcelona, Madrid and San Sebasti√°n, ran from 1919 to 1980. The story of Maria Brillas, as told by her dresses, created by Pedro Rodr√≠guez, is part of Barcelona's history and belongs to the cultural heritage of Catalonia and Spain.What to Wear?

It is an area graph that depicts the quantity of work in a given state, showing arrivals, time in queue, quantity in queue, and departure. Cumulative flow diagrams are seen in the literature of agile software development and lean product development. They are also seen in transportation. Some people consider a cumulative flow diagram to be a more sophisticated version of a \\"burn up chart\\", which is the opposite of a burn down chart. A burn down chart tracks work remaining over time while burn up charts like the CFD track the growth (or shrinkage) of work in certain states over time. In agile software development, when teams use kanban methodology, the cumulative flow diagram shows the number of active items in each column on a kanban board. The ideal cumulative flow diagram has each line in the cumulative flow diagram trends upwards constantly. With its focus on tracking changes in queue size per state, the CFD has a stronger focus on identifying and rooting out the causes of dramatic changes in throughput. Another term is \\"cumulative input-output diagram\\". The term \\"Newell curve\\" is also used, in reference to Gordon F. Newell. It is not known if Newell originated the curve.

Life  His parents were Henry, Prince of Nassau-Dillenburg (1641-1701) and his wife Duchess Dorothea Elizabeth of Legnica. After his parents died, his older brother William II took up Christian's education. Christian and his Hofmeister, Gustav von Moltke, were sent to Leiden, where Christian enthusiastically studied mathematics at the local university. In 1708, Christian joined the Dutch army as a major. On 16 April 1711, he was promoted to colonel. He fought with distinction in the Dutch against the French during the War of the Spanish Succession. After the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, he returned to Germany and resided in Hadamar. In 1711, Francis Alexander, the last Prince of Nassau-Hadamar had died and his territory had been divided among the surviving Ottonian lines of Nassau: Nassau-Dietz, Nassau-Dillenburg and Nassau-Siegen. In 1724, his brother William II died without a male heir and Christian inherited Nassau-Dillenburg. In 1731, Prince Frederick William II of Nassau-Siegen died. With his death, the Calvinist line of Nassau-Siegen died out. Initially, the rule of Nassau- Siegen was taken of by Emmanuel Ignaz (1688-1735), a younger half-brother of William Hyacinth, who had been deposed in 1707. After Emmanuel Ignaz died in 1735, Nassau-Siegen was divided by the remaining Ottonian lines: Nassau-Dietz and Nassau-Dillenburg. As head of the Ottonian branch, Christian concluded an inheritance treaty in 1736 with Charles August, the head of the Walram line: if one of the line were to die out in the male line, the other line would inherit their possessions. Prince Christian died of a attack on 28 August 1739 in Stra√üebersbach (now part of Dietzh√∂lztal). Since he was childless, Nassau- Dillenburg was divided between William IV of Nassau-Dietz and William Hyacinth of Nassau-Siegen. The latter was in financial difficulties and sold his share on 17 February 1742 to William IV for . Prince Christian was appointed Knight of the Order of Saint Hubert.

In 1975, due to pressure from the local churches and religious groups in the area, Ripley's changed their names to \\"World of the Unexplained\\" and re-outfitted them with new attractions. With the popularity of the television show \\"In Search Of\\", Ripley's hired the show's narrator, Leonard Nimoy, to film a short introduction to visitors at the entrance to the museums. The museums displayed not only witchcraft attractions but new ones that featured Bigfoot, flying saucers, the Bermuda Triangle, werewolves, and a fortune teller with a talking crystal ball. In 1985 the museums closed down for good, due to poor ticket sales. Ripleys' relocated all the attractions to other Ripley's Odditoriums around the US.

It stars Kiefer Sutherland, Marcus Thomas, Molly Ringwald, and Daryl Hannah. It won the Crystal Heart Award at the 2001 Heartland Film Festival. Plot Rising rodeo star Ely Braxton (Marcus Thomas) is recovering from injuries that almost took his life. Against the wishes of his mother Rose Braxton (Melinda Dillon) and girlfriend Connie (Molly Ringwald), Ely starts riding bulls again to achieve his dream of becoming a champion bull rider like his estranged father, Reid Braxton (Pete Postlethwaite). Ely's older brother, Hank (Kiefer Sutherland), is a champion bullfighter and stock contractor, and the two use each other to better their rodeo skills and work together at their family ranch in Santa Maria, California. As Ely's rodeo career becomes highly successful, he starts a relationship with Celia Jones (Daryl Hannah), who is a barrel racer and Hank's love interest. Hank is consumed with anger and jealousy at Ely's betrayal and the brothers become estranged. At the championship rodeo in Las Vegas, Ely, having ended his relationship with Celia, draws Hank's unridden and greatly feared bull Zapata and asks for Hank's help. Hank tells Ely to let go of the past memories he has been carrying around his entire life, and gives Ely the address of their father's house in Las Vegas. Ely meets his father, but his father does not recognize Ely and thinks he is a rodeo reporter, but Ely says he is just a bull rider. Ely realizes his father is not the hero he has idolized. Ely successfully rides Zapata, but is injured; in the process, Hank rushes to save Ely from Zapata, but is killed when Zapata crushes his chest. When the Braxton ranch hand and family friend Joe (Russell Means) brings Zapata back to the Braxton ranch, Rose grabs a shotgun and almost shoots Zapata in her grief over Hank's death, but Joe and Ely talk her down. They say they will shoot Zapata, but Ely remembers Hank's pride in the bull and shoots into the air as Zapata calmly walks into the pasture. Joe tells Ely that Hank would not have shot Zapata.

Together they formed the Finca G√ºell, an extensive parcel of land (30,000 m2). The Can Feliu building was remodeled by the architect Joan Martorell i Montells, who built a Caribbean-style small palace, together with a Gothic-style chapel and surrounded by magnificent gardens. Later the building remodeling was given to Antoni Gaud√≠, together with the construction of a surrounding perimeter wall and the side entry pavilions. Gaud√≠ also partially designed the gardens surrounding the palace, placing two fountains and a pergola and planted many Mediterranean plants like palm trees, cypress trees, magnolias, pine trees and eucalyptus.

History  In 1942, the Museu d'Arts, Ind√∫stries i Tradicions Populars created a popular engraving department, using the wood engraving blocks assembled by the Board of Museums before the war. In 1968, due to a growing contribution of diverse materials (machines, moulds, blocks and printed materials) this small museum, located in the Poble Espanyol, began to expand its radius of operation and adopted the name Secci√≥ de Gravat i Arts Gr√†fiques. In 1974 it expanded once again to house an active print shop and was renamed the Museu del Llibre i de les Arts Gr√†fiques, although the operative opening of the print shop did not happen until 1981. The museum now forms part of the Disseny Hub Barcelona, and its collections have been relocated to their present home in the repository of the Palau de Pedralbes.Gabinet de les Arts Gr√†fiques. History  Collections  The collections of the museum bring together significant samples of typography such as punches, matrices and tracing plates, as well as, prints that include samples of binding, packaging, labels and posters. Important printers such as; Elzeviriana, Bobes, Seix Barral and Tobella, Naips Comas (the makers of playing cards), Tallers Roca (the industrial bookbinders) and the Neufville type foundry, have contributed to the museum's expanding resources. In addition, certain artists and their families, have also donated graphic works and engraving moulds ‚Äì as is the case of Miquel Plana and the families of Josep Obiols and Miquel Llovet. The collection is presented during exhibitions and study galleries programmed by Disseny Hub Barcelona. The concept that initiated the Study Galleries was to create an area that combines the ideas of a temporary exhibition, a documentation centre and a museum repository but that has its own identity. Various objects are assembled according to their typologies and presented in a way that allows visitors to study, contemplate and reflect upon the museums collections.Wallpapers Study Galleries  Exhibits  = Posters.

The second space is organized thematically, and includes posters created by the youngest designers of the 1960s and organized according to their function, characteristics, genres, elements (colour), components (typography, photography, illustration) and formats. When deciding which posters would become part of this study gallery, the curator Raquel Pelta (of the Foundation for the History of Design), took into account the value of the work from a graphic design perspective: the value of the elements of the whole, the innovative character in regards to the moment in which it was created and the balance between form and function.

The only species is Karenites ornamentatus, named in 1995. Several fossil specimens are known from the town of Kotelnich in Kirov Oblast. Description Karenites is known from a partial holotype skeleton, two partial skulls, and isolated jaw bones. Although incomplete, the skulls preserve small and delicate structures like nasal turbinates on the inside of the skull and the stapes bone of the ear. The skull of Karenites is about long, with the snout much longer than the temporal region of the skull behind the eye sockets. Viewed from above, the skull is triangular. The snout is broad, and the skull widens toward the occiput or posterior margin. Two large holes behind the eye socket called temporal fenestrae occupy most of the posterior skull. Between these fenestra is a narrow sagittal crest. In front of this crest, the skull roof bones are weakly pitted with small bumps and ridges for blood vessels. Some specimens include parts of the sclerotic ring, a ring of bone embedded in the eye. On each side of the upper jaw are five incisors, two or three precanines, one canine, and eleven or twelve postcanines. The incisors and precanines are long, thin, and slightly curved, separated from each other by a small gap. The canine is much longer, projecting slightly forward from the tooth socket and curving backward along its length. The postcanine teeth are shorter and broader than the incisors and precanines. Toward the back of the skull the tips of the teeth flatten. The lower jaw is thin and curves upward to the arch of the cheek, except for a large coronoid process that extends to the articular-quadrate jaw joint at the back of the skull. The lower jaw has three small incisors angled slightly forward, a large canine tooth projecting upward, and thirteen small, blunt postcanine teeth. The farthest postcanine teeth have small secondary cusps behind their tips. These multicusped teeth may have been adaptations for crushing food, although they are not as well developed as the teeth of other therocephalians like Ericiolacerta. In 1999, thoracic plates were reported to be present in the holotype of Karenites. Thoracic plates are plates of bone on the underside of the rib cage that are typically found in reptiles, and unusual for mammal relatives like therocephalians. This bone was later reinterpreted as an interclavicle, part of the pectoral girdle common to all early therapsids. Paleobiology The presence of a sclerotic ring in Karenites may be an indication that it was aquatic. Pits on the skull have been interpreted as evidence for well-developed whiskers, which may have been used in hunting aquatic prey. Some therocephalians like Perplexisaurus have also been interpreted as aquatic predators, and share many similarities with Karenites. While these aquatic forms had strong sutures between cranial bones, which may have stabilized the skull when consuming large aquatic prey like fishes, Karenites had weaker, slightly movable skull joints associated with feeding on smaller terrestrial prey like insects. Its multicuspid teeth also suggest it fed on insects. Karenites has long limb bones that indicate a fully terrestrial rather than aquatic lifestyle. Ridges on the inside of the skull of Karenites form a series of sinuses. These sinuses may have been associated with improvements in the sense of smell of therocephalians, but they are not thought to be olfactory structures. Bony projections on the underside of the lower jaw of Karenites may have supported tissues that transmitted sound to the stapes bone in the ear. Early therapsids like Karenites lack the well- developed auditory system of mammals, which had evolved from a restructuring of bones in the back of the skull and the lower jaw, and probably had a poor sense of hearing. As an early stage in the development of the mammalian auditory system, Karenites may have been able to hear some sounds by placing its jaw on the ground to detect vibrations.

History For many years, a number of branches (locals) in the National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC) had collected food for the needy as part of their community service effort. The national, coordinated effort by the NALC to help fight hunger in America grew out of discussions in 1991 by a number of leaders at the time, including NALC President Vincent R. Sombrotto, AFL-CIO Community Services Director Joseph Velasquez, USPS Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank, and NALC Director of Public Relations Drew Von Bergen. A pilot drive was held in 10 cities in October 1991, and it proved so successful that work began immediately on making it a nationwide effort. After receiving input from food banks and pantries, the NALC decided that the best time of year for this food drive to take place would be in the late spring. Most food banks start running out of food this time of year due to the largest donations being made around Thanksgiving and Christmas. A revamped food drive was organized for May 15, 1993. The goal for the organization was to have at least one branch of the National Association of Letter Carriers participate from all 50 states. The first year of the nationwide effort collected over 11 million pounds of food, which was a one-day record in the United States, and with more than 220 union branches covering more than 1,000 communities participating. Thereafter, the national drive was set for the second Saturday of May each year. In 2010, 77.1 million pounds of food were collected, which helped the food drive surpass the 1 billion pound mark in total food collected over its history. In 2016, the food drive collected a record 80 million pounds of nonperishable food, raising the total amount of donations picked up over the quarter-century history of the drive to more than 1.5 billion pounds. In 2017, the food drive celebrated its 25th anniversary. The official magazine of the National Association of Letter Carriers,The Postal Record, ran a history of the drive's first 25 years, featuring an interview with Drew Von Bergen, a former NALC employee who coordinated the drives for many years. How it works The Stamp Out Hunger Food Drive is held in all 50 states every year on the second Saturday of May: on this day, mail carriers both deliver mail and collect food donations. It is held in May because most food banks face a depletion in donations from the holiday season. Today, the Stamp Out Hunger effort is the United States' largest single-day food drive. Impact In 2016, the food drive collected a record 80 million pounds of nonperishable food, raising the total amount of donations picked up over the quarter-century history of the drive to more than 1.5 billion pounds. The NALC food drive has also received two Presidential Certificates of Achievement. Partnerships The Stamp Out Hunger Food Drive has many supporters including The U.S. Postal Service, Campbell Soup Company, Cox Target Media, Valpak,the National Rural Letter Carriers Association, the Feeding America food bank network, the United Way of America and its local United Ways, the AFL-CIO Community Services network, Uncle Bob's Self Storage, and AARP. Signing on as national food drive partners in 2017 were the U.S. Postal Service, the National Rural Letter Carriers' Association, the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW), United Way Worldwide, AFL-CIO, AARP Foundation, Valpak] and Valassis. Donations The Stamp Out Hunger Food Drive will take donations of nonperishable foods in non-breakable containers such as cereals, dry milk, cereal bars, baby formula, canned fruit, canned vegetables, canned meats and fish, boxed or canned juices, canned soups, peanut butter, boxed instant food, pasta/boxed pasta, boxed rice and dried beans.

The battle saw some of the fiercest urban combat during the war and it took four days for the United States to capture the city. The battle was a blow to Nazi Germany as Nuremberg was a center of the Nazi regime. The Nuremberg Rally took place in the city and to lose the city to the Americans took a heavy toll on already low German morale. Even though American forces heavily outnumbered the German forces, it wasn't until 20 April, that the 7th Army took the city center. The battle devastated the city.  Background  The Western Allies invaded Germany from the west on 8 February 1945. The German Army took heavy losses as the Allied armies crossed the Rhine and surrounded the Ruhr area as the Soviet armies pushed from the east. By April the US and Soviet armies were closing in on each other, constricting an already narrow gap of German-controlled territory running from Berlin to Munich and including Nuremberg. As the 12th Army Group continued to push east towards Berlin, the 6th Army Group received orders to push into southern Germany and into Austria. Despite the heavier resistance from the German Army in the south as compared to the north, the US 7th Army broke out of its bridgehead on the Rhine south of Frankfurt on 28 March. After fierce fighting, the 7th Army captured Aschaffenburg in Bavaria on 3 April and Heilbronn in W√ºrttemberg on 12 April, which left Nuremberg wide open to American attack. On 12 April the German High Command ordered the unconditional defense of all cities and Hitler placed Reich Defense Commissioner and Gauleiter of Franconia Karl Holz in charge of the German forces around Nuremberg. On 15 April the 7th Army advanced towards Nuremberg, rapidly capturing Bamberg in the process. As the 7th Army neared Nuremberg, Holz ordered setting up anti-tank barriers as well as anti-aircraft guns around the old city. Holz's forces were heavily outnumbered, but he still believed that \\"the Americans would break sooner or later\\".  The battle  By 16 April, the 7th Army had begun its assault on Nuremberg, not from the west as Holz expected, but from the east and northeast. By the end of the day, the Americans had captured the outskirts of Erlenstegen and Buch. Arthur Schoeddert, a constable of anti-aircraft artillery, failed to execute Hitler's orders to blow up electricity, gas and water plants in the city. By 17 April, the 7th Army captured the marshaling yard and the surrounding area as well as the Veilhofstrasse and Woehrd neighborhoods. By evening, the airport to the north was captured and US artillery began to shell the old city. American troops met fierce resistance around the old city on 18 April, which destroyed and damaged many buildings around the old city, including the historic Nuremberg Castle. On 18 April, as American artillery continued to shell the old city, U.S. troops were able to reach the old city via the Burgschmietstrasse. On 20 April, the 3rd Infantry Division under the command of Major General John W. O'Daniel and the 45th Infantry Division under Major General Robert T. Frederick laid siege to the old city. German resistance was so great that American heavy artillery and air support was deployed. Holz ordered his men to continue to fight. Holz himself was trapped in the police station in the old city, but continued to resist. After American troops gave him four chances for a peaceful surrender, he was killed while American troops overran the building. After Holz's death, second-in-command Colonel Wolf realised that the city could no longer be held. At 11:00 he ordered all German troops in the area to surrender. On the evening of 20 April, the American flag was hoisted at Adolf Hitler Platz, formally ending the battle.

The actual last surviving veteran, Cyrillus-Camillus Barbary, who had emigrated to the United States, died in 2004. World War I service In 1916, he escaped from German-occupied Belgium and traveled to the Netherlands, England, and finally France to join the Belgian Army which was fighting at a northern section of the Western Front, known as the Yser Front. At the age of 16, Ooghe lied about his age in order to enlist. He first joined the cavalry (5e r√©giment des Lanciers), then the grenadiers (1er r√©giment des Grenadiers). As he was in charge of the maintenance of the telephone and telegraph lines, Ooghe was often in the front line, also involved in action. At the end of March 1917, he participated in an attack against a German bunker in Rekkem and was very nearly killed. On 11 November 1918, while on duty and eager to celebrate the armistice, the Germans bombarded the positions where Ooghe was stationed and ten of his companions perished before the bugle sounded the end of the conflict. This was a traumatic experience that Ooghe would not forget. Post War activities Ooghe was a recipient of numerous honors and awards and was until his death often regarded as the last living Belgian survivor of World War I. He was a regular participant in the annual commemorations of the war and was often willing to speak at length about his experiences and the futility of conflict. His aim was to infuse a civic sense in young people, as well as the importance of keeping the memory of the conflict alive. Death Ooghe died on 8 September 2001 due to weakness after having suffered from bronchitis for several months. He was 102 years old. Up until a short time before his death, he was widely announced as being the last surviving Belgian World War I veteran. The last Belgian veteran of the war, Cyrillus-Camillus Barbary, died in the United States in 2004.

When a large Persian army invaded the Syrian territories, the governor Antiochus entrusted St. Andrew with the command of the Roman army, giving him the title of \\"Stratelates\\" (\\"Commander\\"). Invoking Christ to aid him and a small detachment of pagan soldiers in battle, St Andrew proceeded against the adversary and routed the numerous host of Persians.

The website is financially backed by Paul Singer, an American billionaire hedge fund manager and conservative activist.  History  The Free Beacon was founded by Michael Goldfarb, Aaron Harrison, and Matthew Continetti. It launched on February 7, 2012, as a project of the Center for American Freedom, a conservative advocacy group modeled on the liberal Center for American Progress. The site is known for its conservative reporting, with the intention of publicizing stories and influence the coverage of the mainstream media, and modeled after liberal counterparts in the media such as Think Progress and Talking Points Memo. The site has roots in the neoconservative wing of the Republican Party. Jack Hunter, a staff member of Senator Rand Paul's office, resigned in 2013 after a Free Beacon report detailing his past as a radio shock jock known as the \\"Southern Avenger\\" who wore a luchador mask of the Confederate flag. The publication also broke several stories about Hillary Clinton's successful 1975 legal defense of an accused child rapist that attracted national media attention. From October 2015 to May 2016, the Washington Free Beacon hired Fusion GPS to conduct opposition research on \\"multiple candidates\\" during the 2016 presidential election, including Donald Trump. The Free Beacon stopped funding this research when Donald Trump had clinched the Republican nomination. Fusion GPS would later hire former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele and produce a dossier alleging links between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. Paul Singer, a billionaire and hedge fund manager, who is a major donor to the Free Beacon, said he was unaware of this dossier until it was published by BuzzFeed News in January 2017. On October 27, 2017, the Free Beacon publicly disclosed that it had hired Fusion GPS, and stated that it \\"had no knowledge of or connection to the Steele dossier, did not pay for the dossier, and never had contact with, knowledge of, or provided payment for any work performed by Christopher Steele.\\" The Free Beacon came under criticism for its reporting on Fusion GPS. Three days before it was revealed that it was the Free Beacon that had funded the work by Fusion GPS, the Free Beacon wrote that the firm's work ‚Äúwas funded by an unknown GOP client while the primary was still going on.\\" The Free Beacon has published pieces that have sought to portray the work by Fusion GPS as unreliable \\"without noting that it considered Fusion GPS reliable enough to pay for its services.\\" In an editor's note, Continetti said \\"the reason for this omission is that the authors of these articles, and the particular editors who reviewed them, were unaware of this relationship,\\" and that the outlet was reviewing its editorial process to avoid similar issues in the future.  Reception  Jim Rutenberg of The New York Times described the reporting style of the Free Beacon as \\"gleeful evisceration.\\" The Atlantics Conor Friedersdorf called the Free Beacons mission \\"decadent and unethical\\". Ben Howe wrote in The Daily Beast that The Washington Free Beacon established \\"itself as a credible source of conservative journalism with deep investigative dives and exposes on money in politics,\\" but that after Trump's election \\"shifted away from the template they were establishing and more towards the path of least resistance: spending their time criticizing the left and the media, along with healthy doses of opinion writing.\\" McKay Coppins in the Columbia Journalism Review wrote in September 2018 that while the website contains \\"a fair amount of trolling... it has also earned a reputation for real-deal journalism...If a partisan press really is the future, we could do worse than the Free Beacon.\\" Jeet Heer, writing in The New Republic, commented: \\"Unlike other comparable conservative websites, the Free Beacon makes an effort to do original reporting. Its commitment to journalism should be welcomed by liberals.\\" In 2015, Mother Jones wrote positively of the Free Beacon, commenting that it is far better than contemporary conservative outlets such as The Daily Caller. Mother Jones however said that \\"the Beacon hasn't always steered clear of stories that please the base but don‚Äôt really stand up,\\" and that it pieces inflammatory pieces that \\"push conservatives‚Äô buttons\\".

Mohammed al-Maskati serves as its president. The organization was found by Mohammed al-Maskati and Hussain Jawad (who also served as its vice-president) among others. Early history The group's activities have included protesting for the freedom of Egyptian blogger Kareem Amer as well as reporting on domestic human trafficking in Bahrain. In June 2005, the BYSHR attempted to register as a non-governmental organization with the Bahraini government, but was refused. When the group nonetheless continued its work, al-Maskati was summoned to court in 2007 on charges of leading an \\"unregistered organization\\", which carried a maximum sentence of six months imprisonment. The International Freedom of Expression Exchange issued an appeal for a letter writing campaign on his behalf, describing the arrest as \\"just the latest example of the government using judicial measures to silence human rights activists\\". Al- Maskati's trial was later postponed until 2009, In June 2010, al-Maskati was found guilty and ordered to pay a fine of 500 Bahraini dinar. The Bahrain Centre for Human Rights protested the sentence, describing it as \\"a continuation of the Authority's policy in Bahrain to restrict civil society institutions\\". Role in the Bahraini uprising In February 2011, Bahrain saw a series of large-scale pro-democracy protests as part of the international Arab Spring. The BYSHR were active at Pearl Roundabout in the capital of Manama, which quickly became a center for the protests. Among the protestors' demands were a new constitution and the replacement of Prime Minister Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa‚Äîan uncle of Bahrain's king who had held the post since 1971‚Äîwith an elected official.

The team, originally a U19 national team until 2006, has competed in the African Women U-19 Championship qualifying competition and the African qualifying competitions for the FIFA U19/U20 World Cup. Because of local conditions related to the whole of women's football on the continent, the team faces challenges for improving their performance. Background Zambia women's national under-20 football team is nicknamed the Young She-polopolo. The team's official kit colours include green shorts, a green jersey and green socks. Women's football was formally organised by the Football Association of Zambia in 1983. Since that time, Zambia has created a women's senior national team and an under-20 team. Women's football continues to be supported by the national federation who have budgeted money for the women's game and youth game. In 2009, there were 100 women's teams for players over 16, and 112 youth women's teams for players under 16. Women's football in Africa as a whole faces problems that include limited access to education, poverty amongst women in the wider society, and fundamental inequality present in the society that occasionally allows for female specific human rights abuses. When quality football players are produced in Africa, often they leave the country to seek greater opportunities elsewhere, to the detriment of the local game. Funding also is a problem for the women's game in Africa, with most of the funding for women's football in the Africa coming from FIFA, not the local national football association. Performance Zambia women's national under-20 football team has participated in qualification tournaments for several events including the U19/U20 World Cup and the African Women's Championships. Up until the 2006, the FIFA Women World Cup close to this age group was for U19, but for the 2006 World Cup, the age was changed to U20. Zambia has participated in the qualification process for this competition as both the FIFA Women U19 World Cup and FIFA Women U20 World Cup. The team participated in the first edition of the African Women U-19 Championship held in 2002. Zambia earned a bye in the first round when Malawi withdrew from the competition. They made it to the quarterfinals, where they met South Africa women's national under-20 football team whom Zambia lost to twice with scores of 0‚Äì1 and 2‚Äì3. Zambia women's national under-20 football team participated in the 2006 African Women U-20 Championship. They played a home and away series in Round 1 against Mozambique women's national under-20 football team, losing the match in Kitwe 0‚Äì4. In the return match in Mozambique, they won 2‚Äì1. They participated in the FIFA CAF U-20 World Cup 2008 Qualifying. They played against Egypt in the opening round. In the first match in Lusaka on 12 January 2008, they tied 2‚Äì2. In the return match on 25 January 2008 in Ismailia, they against tied but with a score of 1‚Äì1. Zambia participated in the 2010 Africa Cup qualifiers. As part of a home and away series in the competition against South Africa, Zambia lost the first match 0‚Äì6 in early January in South Africa. On 23 January 2010, they played their second match, a return game at home Zambia, with the side being skippered by Veronica Banda, Jane Mutambo in goal and with Wisdom Kaira was the team's coach 2010 also saw Zambia's U20 team compete in the FIFA U20 World Cup qualifying tournament for Africa. In the first round, Zambia women's national under-20 football team beat Kenya women's national under-20 football team at home 2‚Äì1. In the return leg in Kenya, Zambia lost 4‚Äì0 and did not advance. In 2012, Zambia again tried to qualify for the FIFA U20 World Cup in the African tournament. This time, the Zambian side was coached by Martha Kapombo. In the first round, Zambia lost to Kenya by an aggregate of 5‚Äì2 from the two matches, one home and away for both teams. Zambia lost the second match at Nyayo National Stadium in Nairobi by a score of 0‚Äì4. In a mid- February game, they had beaten Kenya 2‚Äì1 at Sunset Stadium in Lusaka. Kapombo said of the second game, \\"We were not prepared to lose to Kenya; actually we knew that we were going to beat them by four goals like they did to us. They changed most of the players who we played with in Zambia and that made it very hard for us in the midfield which failed to click.\\" The Kenyan coach Florence Adhiambo said of the game \\"\\"We have come very far, we've been training hard and now we've seen what good training can do. We have worked hard to be here and the fans really played a very important role into this victory.\\" The leg winner was scheduled to play Tunisia in the second round.

History First Nations peoples and Native Americans most often organized themselves by clan and family; ties of kinship were considered central to intertribal relations and the understanding of tribal political power. In the Iroquois Confederacy, for instance, the relations between individual bands were metaphorically described using paternal (parent to child), or fraternal (sibling to sibling) terms to indicate the importance of two groups in relation to each other. Within this context, and to make themselves better understood during treaty negotiations, British representatives often referred to Jehovah (aka God or the Lord) as \\"the Great Father\\" (see: Great Spirit). The terms was also used to refer to the British monarchs George III and Queen Victoria as \\"the Great Father\\" and \\"the Great White Mother\\" respectively, and to the native people as his or her \\"Red Children.\\" David Laird invoked the phrase while explaining Treaty 7 to the Blackfoot: The anthropologist Raymond DeMallie has explained that - due to the nature of Native American society - the use of kinship terms such as \\"Great Father\\" and \\"Great Mother\\" was a cunning diplomatic tactic, and not an assertion of Native inferiority. In many cases the representatives who negotiated treaties on behalf of the \\"Great Father\\" referred to themselves as the \\"brothers\\" of indigenous peoples; among some tribes it was a grave offense to refuse anything to a brother. In the United States, the primacy of the Great Father was promoted through elaborate displays of military pageantry, the use of mystical language to describe the far-removed President, and the distribution of \\"peace medals\\" bearing the portrait of the sitting head of state (giving gifts, such as peace medals, further reinforced the paternal nature of the relationship as gift giving, in many Native cultures, was typically reserved for parent-child interaction). As in Canada, Native peoples were referred to as the \\"children\\" of the Great Father; so intense was the myth created surrounding him that chiefs brought to Washington, D.C. to meet the President often manifested symptoms of terror prior to an audience. Lean Bear, upon being presented to Abraham Lincoln at the White House, reportedly found himself suddenly unable to speak. Winnebago chief Hoowaneka recalled his audience with John Quincy Adams by explaining \\"I thought I was in heaven, and the old man there, I thought was the Great Spirit.\\" The profile of Thomas Jefferson is featured on an 1801 peace medal. An example of an invocation of the term \\"Great Father\\" by an American official can be found in a decree given by Thomas L. McKenney to the Menominee, in which McKenney declares he has received instructions from the Great Father to appoint a penultimate chief with whom the United States could negotiate. On occasions when territory would pass from the influence of one Western nation to another, the new power might refer to the former Great Father in past- tense, as when William Henry Harrison addressed the Shawnee, declaring that \\"my children, let us look back to times that are past. It has been a long time since you called the King of Great Britain your father.\\" In the United States, additional titles would sometimes be invoked to explain the political authority of the President to Native Americans, often as a \\"chief\\" of many \\"fires\\" (fire used as a metonym for state). In 1791, for instance, Henry Knox greeted the Miami on behalf of \\"General Washington, the Great Chief of the Thirteen Fires,\\" while John Adams would come to be known to the same tribe as the \\"Great Chief of the Seventeen Fires.\\" See also *Folklore of the United States *Tecumseh's curse References Category:United States federal Indian policy Category:State ritual and ceremonies Category:History of indigenous peoples of North America Category:Titles ","title":"Great Father and Great Mother"},{"id":"35496345","text":"The National Institute of Public Cooperation and Child Development (NIPCCD) is an Indian government agency in New Delhi under the Ministry of Women and Children Development tasked with promotion of voluntary action research, training and documentation in the overall domain of women empowerment and child development in India.

It is celebrated as the first international public flying event, confirming the viability of heavier-than-air flight. It marked the first contest for the prestigious Gordon Bennett Trophy, sponsored by Gordon Bennett, publisher of the New York Herald, won by American Glenn Curtiss in competition with Louis Bleriot. The meeting saw the breaking of the world record for distance, a flight of 180 km (110 mi) by Henri Farman, as well as the debut of the lightweight Gnome engine, which would achieve much acclaim.

It was held on the plain of B√©theny, about north of Reims, which later became the Reims ‚Äì Champagne Air Base. A large grandstand was constructed for the event, together with a row of sheds to accommodate the aircraft. Next to the grandstand was the \\"Popular enclosure\\", complete with an enormous scoreboard. Amenities for the spectators included a restaurant that could seat 600 people, an area of specially laid lawn with bandstands and flowerbeds, and a post office, from which 50,000 postcards were sent each day and nearly a million words dispatched by press correspondents.Cash Receipts at Rheims'Flight 11 September 1911 The spectator area was only a few hundred metres from the Laon-Reims railway line, and a temporary station was provided. A rectangular competition course of , marked by four pylons was set up for the various competitions, with the strip intended for taking off and landing in front of the grandstands, opposite which was the timekeepers hut, provided with a signalling system to indicate to the spectators which event was being competed for. Flying conditions were primitive: the area over which much of the flying was to take place was farmland: some of the crops under cultivation had not been harvested and where this had been done there were haystacks: more than one flyer was to fall foul of these obstacles. =Events= *Sunday, 22 August -- Contest to decide the French team for the Gordon-Bennett Trophy; Prix de la Vitesse, (day 1); Prix du Tour de Piste, (day 1); Prix des Aeronauts, (day 1). *Monday, 23 August -- Grand Prix de la Champagne (day 1); Prix du Tour de Piste (day 2); Prix des Aeronauts (day 2) . *Tuesday, 24 August -- Grand Prix de la Vitesse (day 2) ; Prix du Tour de Piste, (day 3); Prix des Aeronauts (day 3). *Wednesday, 25 August -- Grand Prix de la Champagne (day 2); Prix du Tour de Piste, (day 4); Prix des Aeronauts (day 4). *Thursday, 26 August -- Grand Prix de la Champagne (day 3) ; Prix du Tour de Piste, (day 5); Prix des Aeronauts (day 5); Landing competition for spherical balloons. *Friday, 27 August -- Grand Prix de la Champagne (day 4); Prix du Tour de Piste (day 6); Prix des Aeronauts (day 6). *Saturday, August 28 -- Coupe Internationale d'Aviation Gordon-Bennett; Prix des Passagers (day 1); Prix du Tour de Piste (day 7); Prix des Aeronauts (day 7). *Sunday 29 August -- Prix de la Vitesse (day 3); Prix des Passagers (day 2); Prix de l'Altitude; Prix du Tour de Piste (day 8); Prix des Aeronauts (day 8) A souvenir postcard showing Glenn Curtiss at the controls of his aircraft The Gordon Bennett Trophy This was the most prestigious event of the meeting, and was a competition between national teams, sponsored by Gordon Bennett, the publisher of the New York Herald and was being held for the first time. It consisted of a time trial over two laps of the circuit rather than a direct race, and each nation was allowed three entrants. The qualification trials for the French team on the Sunday morning were hampered by the weather conditions, with the most successful competitor, Eug√®ne Lefebvre flying a French-built Wright biplane, narrowly failing to complete two laps of the course: the only other pilot to make a convincing flight was Louis Bl√©riot, and the third place was later given to Hubert Latham flying an Antoinette monoplane, on account of his performance in trials for the Prix de la Vitesse held later that day, during which \\"the wonderful and unprecedented spectacle was witnessed of seven machines in the air at one time\\".\\"Rheims Aviation Week: The First Day\\" Flight 28 August 1909 p519 Other nations were represented by the American aviator Glenn Curtiss and George Cockburn flying a French Farman III biplane representing Great Britain: promised Italian and Austrian entries did not materialise. On the Saturday of the race Curtiss made the first flights, first making an attempt for the Circuit Prize and lowering the record to 7 m 55.4 s. Encouraged by this, he then made his attempt for the Trophy, completing the two laps in 15 m 50.4 s. Cockburn made the next attempt, but was unable to complete one lap. Lefebvre then made the first attempt by the French team, only managing a time of 20 m 47.6 s. Latham's time was 16 m 32 s. Bl√©riot, flying last, managed a first lap time in the same time as Curtiss' second (faster) lap, but during the second round he was impeded by a squall, and his total time was 15 min 56.1 sec. Under the rules of the Trophy, Curtiss' victory meant that the next race would be held in America. Later in the day Bl√©riot did secure one prize, that for the fastest circuit, with a time of 7 m 47.4 s.\\"Tabulated Performances &c; of the Rheims Meeting\\" Flight 4 September 1909 p.53 Grand Prix de Champagne et la Ville de Reims This was a distance prize offering six prizes of 50,000, 25,000, 10,000, 5,000, 5,000, and 5,000 francs.\\"Rheims Aviation Week\\" Flight 14 August 1909 p492 The competition for this award resulted in the world record for distance being broken three times in three days, the prize eventually being won by Henri Farman with a flight of , flying a Farman III biplane. Farman eventually landed because the competition stopped at half-past seven, and any distance flown after this time did not count. On landing, in the words of the correspondent from the London Times he was \\"seized upon by the enthusiastic crowd and carried in triumph to the buffet, where a scene of almost delirious excitement was witnessed\\" Although French by upbringing, Farman's father was British and he was therefore also technically British, this mixed nationality being celebrated by a military band playing both the French and the British national anthems to celebrate his victory. Farman had replaced the Vivinus engine of his aircraft, which was proving unreliable, with a Gnome Omega rotary engine just before the flight. Since the published rules of competition forbade any changes to the aircraft, his victory was contested by Latham and L√©on Levavasseur, the designer of the Antoinette aircraft and engine, but the change had been officially approved before the flight, and their complaint was not successful. The Reims meeting was the public debut of the Gnome engine, and although probably unappreciated by the majority of the spectators, this was one of the most significant events to take place at the Rheims meeting. The Gnome, designed and manufactured by the Seguin brothers, was both light in weight and relatively reliable, and was a major advance in aviation technology: Louis Bl√©riot later saying \\"it enabled the industry to advance by leaps and bounds\\" Three other aircraft were flown using this engine at Reims, the others being the Farman biplanes belonging to Cockburn and Roger Sommer and the Voisin belonging to Louis Paulhan\\"Rheims Aviation Meeting ‚Äî Table of General Details of the Entered Machines\\" Flight 28 August 1909 p.521 Grand Prix de la Vitesse Offering four prizes of 10,000, 5,000, 3,000 and 2,000 francs, for the fastest time over three laps of the circuit. The final attempts for this were held on the last day, and after Curtiss' narrow victory over Bl√©riot spectators were expecting an exciting duel. However, Bl√©riot had a spectacular accident: his aircraft crashed and caught fire, and was destroyed: the prize went to Curtiss. Prix des Passagers A single prize of 10,000 francs, given to the aviator who carried the greatest number of passengers over one lap of the course: in the event of two contestant carrying the same number of passengers the prize going to the fastest. Won by Farman, the only pilot to carry two passengers. Prix de l'Altitude (Height Prize) of 10,000 francs. Won by Hubert Latham flying an Antoinette VII with an altitude of Prix du Tour de Piste (Circuit Prize), of 7,000 and 3,000 francs. for the fastest single lap. Won by Louis Bl√©riot, flying his Type XII monoplane, with a speed of 76.95 km/h (47.8 mph). Prix des A√©ronats A speed trial over five laps for dirigibles. No attempts were made until the last day, when the French Army dirgible Colonel Renard won with a time of 1 hr. 19 m. The only other competitor was a Zodiac dirigible. =Flyers and aircraft= 38 aircraft were entered for the event, but in the end only 23 actually flew, representing nine different types. 87 fights of more than were made The type which was best represented was the Voisin biplane, of which there were seven examples flown. This reflects Gabriel Voisin's position as the first manufacturer to achieve widespread sales of an aircraft, but by this time his design was obsolescent, the only notable achievement being Louis Paulhan's third place in the distance competition. Significantly, Paulhan's aircraft was fitted with a Gnome engine. The meeting effectively demonstrated the practicality of heavier than air aviation: it was evident that the major problem was the unreliability of the engines being used. Many previous notable aviation feats, such as Louis Bl√©riot's recent crossing of the English Channel, had been made near the times of sunrise or sunset, when the air is often very still. In contrast, competition flying at Reims did not start until ten in the morning and ended at half past seven, and although high winds did cause the black flags signalling 'no flying' to be hoisted on occasion, all days saw some flying. The destruction by fire of Louis Bl√©riot's aircraft on the last day was the most spectacular accident to occur during the meeting, and Bl√©riot had been involved in another accident earlier in the week while practising for the passenger carrying event, when he had to make an emergency landing due to engine trouble, Unfortunately there was a troop of dragoons in the way: in swerving to avoid them, he collided with the railings separating the spectator area from the flying track. The damage was repaired overnight. At the time only one aviator had been killed in an aircraft crash, and Flight magazine could write of the \\"customary good luck of the aviator\\" Wednesday' RacingFlight 28 August 1909 when referring to aviators walking away from accidents which wrecked the aircraft: aircraft of the time were slow, generally flown at low altitudes and their wooden construction often meant that the force of impact was absorbed by the disintegration of the airframe, but within a month of the event two of the participating flyers, Lefebvre and Ferdinand Ferber, were to be killed in aircraft accidents.

From then on the early history of jazz in Belgium virtually runs parallel to developments in the country of the birth of jazz, from the minstrel shows in the late 19th century until the first Belgian jazz album in 1927 and beyond. Two important people in Belgium largely influenced the development of jazz in those early years: F√©lix-Robert Faecq and Robert Goffin. The Belgian jazz history yielded many internationally known jazz musicians and composers such as the harmonica player and guitarist Toots Thielemans, guitarist Philip Catherine and the gypsy jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt.  History  = 19th century = The time before jazz developed was recognized as an individual style (1850‚Äì1900) and is now commonly known as the Pre-Jazz period. In this period of the Minstrels, the end of the 19th century, the first recording techniques emerged, which was very important for jazz and for music in general. In 1877 Thomas Alva Edison developed the phonograph, which one year later was presented at an exposition in Brussels, in the 'Panopcticum de Monsieur Castan'. Belgium, however, had no recording studios of its own and therefore the spread of pre-jazz music for a long time (until after the First World War) relied on foreign record labels such as \\"Colombia\\", \\"Zonophone\\" and \\"Favorite\\". Another invention which to a large extent contributed to the development of jazz music was Adolphe Sax's new instrument. By 1890 saxophones in the United States were made by the Conn and Buescher companies, and Belgian virtuoso saxophonists such as Jean Moermans of Sousa's Orchestra ensured the growing popularity of the instrument. The saxophone quickly became the symbol of a new music genre that emerged gradually by the end of the 19th century. Belgian musicians were among the first to make recordings of saxophone solos in America. Eugene Coffin, for example, made recordings on wax cylinders (1895‚Äì1896) and Jean Moermans on gramophone record in Washington D.C. (1897). In 1881, the first American minstrel show was staged in Belgium.The first country in Europe that received the American \\"Minstrel Troupes\\" was England in 1870. It was followed, over the years, by similar shows and performances. By 1900, Belgian music lovers had become acquainted with several American brass bands, the most famous of them being John Philip Sousa's orchestra. They played marches, symphonies, as well as \\"Cakewalks\\" and \\"Ragtimes\\", both characterized by syncopated rhythms. The Belgian composer Louis Fremaux followed in their footsteps and made a cakewalk composition entitled \\"Bruxelles Cake-Walk\\". = 1900-1918 = Ragtime number by Scott Joplin John Philip Sousa ca 1910 As a result of the colonial period in the history of Belgium, around 1900 there arose an interest in the gay 'Negro music' and their white imitators. Also, many new dances blew over that ousted the polkas, polonaises and other dances. Especially in Antwerp's and Brussels' nightlife, this syncopated music, which had started as a parody, had much success because of the atmosphere and danceability. While in America the term rag and ragtime were popular, in Belgium it became fashionable to talk about 'intermezzo'. Ragtime was an eclectic mix of styles and a direct precursor to jazz. Many Belgian composers wrote ragtime scores at the time, but unfortunately there are no records left. In the same period, brass bands and military music flourished. The most renowned orchestra, with a number of Belgian musicians, was the American Orchestra of John Philip Sousa. Again, Belgian composers did successful work. An important year for the spread of American popular music was 1903, when John Philip Sousa's band toured in Belgium and performed at the international exposition of Brussels in may.Center for American music: Sousa Performance Timeline Louis Fremaux and his ragtime composition \\"Toboggan\\", released on the label 'Disque Path√©', was known throughout Europe in 1907. It was a golden time for ragtime in Belgium. Also, music of contemporaries like Jack Bruske was widely played or performed in bars, dance halls and theaters. =1918-1930= The Jazz Singer, 1927 In the 1920s and even more in the 1930s, Brussels, Antwerp and Liege emerged as the three Belgian centers of development of the new music. In summer, coastal cities such as Ostend took over and attracted vacationers in search of the 'blue notes'. This situation would last until the beginning of the 1990s, when other centers emerged such as Ghent and Bruges, while Liege was in relative decline because of the departure of several of the local jazz musicians after the disappearance of a number of small jazz venues.La M√©diath√®que: \\"Le jazz en Belgique\\" (French) The \\"Belgenland\\", a ship of the Red Star Line, was the scene of Belgian jazz performances It was only after the First World War that jazz actually became popular in Belgium, which was largely due to the efforts of F√©lix Faecq and Robert Goffin. F√©lix Faecq was introduced to jazz music in the postwar period after meeting American and Canadian soldiers who liberated the country. Robert Goffin heard two soldiers sing ragtime songs like \\"Are you from Dixie?\\" and the song \\"Robinson Crusoe\\" (\\"What did R.Crusoe do on Friday with Saturday night?\\"). Goffin played music with some classmates of the Brussels law school in the local bars and dance halls. During that time jazz was also synonymous with dance music. According to Faecq it was only when she saw the original black bands that he and his friend Goffin realized that jazz was more than just dance music. Together they discovered jazz music through listening to the Mitchell's Jazz Kings and other black bands in the Alhambra theater. In that period Belgium was in fact the 'jazz capital' of Europe. There were also successful white jazz bands, such as \\"The Georgians\\" with Charles Remue - now considered a pioneer of jazz in Belgium. From 1920 on he led his \\"The Bing Boys.\\" With this band and other bands such as The White Diamonds and The Stompers he introduced the Dixieland style in Belgium. The band that introduced 'jazz' in Belgium is the black New York jazz band \\"Mitchell's Jazz Kings\\". On January 24, 1920, they had several gigs in the Brussels Th√©√¢tre de L'Alahambra. This was the first time the word \\"jazz\\" appeared on a poster in Belgium.Meurant. A, and others, Catalog on the occasion of the exhibition \\"Jazz in Little Belgium\\", Brussels: Royal Museums of Art and History, 2004 In those days the \\"Mohawks Jazz Band\\" (among others) was active in Antwerp and many other groups also embraced the new music, especially in Brussels and Antwerp. They modeled themselves mainly after the U.S. or Chicago Dixieland style, characterized by collective improvisation. Dozens of orchestras brought the Roaring Twenties to Belgium. Faecq made sure that the first Belgian jazz records of the Gennett label arrived in Belgium via Chicago and London. In 1924 he also published (along with his schoolmate Paul Mayaert) \\"Music Magazine\\", which is possibly the first music magazine in the world with serious articles about jazz. Later it was renamed \\"Music\\" and then \\"Actualit√© Musicale\\". After a visit to New Orleans, Robert Goffin wrote the first article in a series about the world of jazz: Aux fronti√®res du Jazz (\\"The frontiers of jazz\\"), which he would later develop into an eponymous book. It was a breakthrough for the popularization of jazz in Belgium, because the only other existing journal, La Revue Musicale Belge, of Marcel Poot did not talk about jazz but about marching music. In 1927, The Jazz Singer, one of the first American sound films, was played in the cinemas, with Al Jolson as the leading actor. That same year, publisher F√©lix Faecq discovered jazz clarinetist and alto saxophonist Charles Remue and his \\"New Stompers\\" playing dance music with a jazz arrangement in a Namur dancing. He took the orchestra to London, were on June 17, 1927, they made recordings for \\"Edison Bell Studios\\". The first historical Belgian jazz recording had become reality. The excellent musicians who were part of the recording sessions (such as Charles Remue and His New Stompers Orchestra) were jazz trumpeter Alfons Cockx, tenor saxophonist Gaston Frederic and the classically trained pianist Stan Brendus who would later become the founder of the first Radio Jazz Orkest (Radio Jazz Orchestra). They recorded fourteen songs that would become popular when they reached the homeland. Even from a European perspective it was pioneering work, because at that time, apart from Belgium, only France and England could draw on a few experienced jazz musicians. On that first Belgian jazz record, they covered some American hits from that era such as \\"Ain't she sweet\\" but Remue still managed to record more than half (7 out of 13) Belgian compositions. These included the popular\\" Wladivostok\\", \\"Slow Gee gee \\"Alahabad\\" and \\"Pamplona,\\" all compositions by David Bee and Peter Packay. In 1928, Peter Packay and his \\"Red Robins\\" recorded a new album at London's Edison Bell Studios. The composers, Peter Packay and David Bee, wrote several well received songs like \\"High Tension\\" and \\"Obsession\\". This duo also made records in the United States. Meanwhile, Faecq had become a central figure of the Belgian jazz, and almost all jazz musicians and composers of some renown eventually came to him. He also made good use of his contacts with London publishers to provide Belgian professional musicians with the latest jazz scores so that they did not have to rely on just hearing the records. After first having distributed the scores, Faecq became agent and publisher for the Stazny publishers in London and sold the original jazz scores in Belgium. His \\"Universal Music Store\\" became a kind of warehouse where Belgian jazz musicians could draw on. In the 1920s, there were plenty of Belgian jazz musicians working in dance halls, cinemas, theaters, bars, cafes and 'cabarets chantants'. Musicians and bands could even be engaged for several weeks in the same venue. Belgian musicians also traveled abroad and made recordings. David Bee said in an interview: \\"For a decent orchestra at that time‚Äù (1928‚Äì30) ‚Äúthere was always work.\\" Good jazz orchestras were indeed still a rare breed in Europe. Jazz musicians also found work on the steamers of the Europe- America lines. David Bee, for example, was bandleader on the ocean liner Ile de France. Two American ships of the Red Star Line, the \\"Belgian Country\\" and the \\"Lapland\\", transporting passengers between Antwerp and New York, took care of a lot of Belgian musicians by offering them a contract. An additional advantage was that it gave them the opportunity to make international contacts and enabled them to visit the country where jazz originated. =1930-1940= Toots Thielemans Tommy Dorsey's big band was very popular in the 1930s and 1940s and was a major inspiration for Belgian musicians to begin forming big bands of their own. At the end of the 1920s experiments were carried out with Belgian radio broadcasting, and in 1930 the NIR-INR (Nationaal Instituut voor de Radio-omroep - Institut National de Radiodiffusion) was founded. On the radio a lot of newly released American records were played. In 1932 Faecq founded the \\"Jazz Club de Belgique\\" and Goffin published his first jazz books. With his Jazz Club de Belgique Faecq organized an annual international tournament for amateur musicians. During this period the innovating music of Louis Armstrong reached Belgian listeners as well. Goffin immediately understood the genius of this musician and started to write about him, and later befriended his idol. Goffin wrote in his Aux Frontieres du Jazz about \\"the true genius of jazz\\" (Armstrong) and the \\"black jazz\\" that he had discovered. He also wrote a book, dedicated to Armstrong: \\"Louis Armstrong, le Roi du Jazz\\"(1947). The early 1930s brought two Belgian trumpet players to the fore that took control of the Belgian jazz scene: Robert De Kers and Gus Deloof. In 1926 De Kers had taken over leadership of Packay orchestra. He then went abroad and after the disintegration of his group he founded the Cabaret Kings in Spain, consisting of one part black musicians, a few Spaniards and five Belgians. He continued performing with this group up to the Spanish Civil War in 1931. After he left, The Cabaret Kings remained active for another 20 years, with varying line-ups. A typical formation of that time consisted of the following musicians: trumpeter De Kers, saxophonists Jean Robert (nicknamed \\"the Belgian Coleman Hawkins\\"), Oscar Toussaint and Andr√© Geysens, bassplayer Fernand Fonteyn, pianist Henry Segers and... guitarist Toots Thielemans. In the U.S.A. the swing era dawned in the 1930s with big bands and smaller combos that brought exciting swing dance music. A number of American orchestras came to Belgium. Their performances proved inspiring. In 1936, there were three major Belgian big bands: the band of saxophonist Fud Candrix, Stan Brenders and Jean Omer. Candrix would lead several bands and make a hundred records. Clarinetist Jean Omer formed his first orchestra in 1926 after listening to records of King Oliver and Louis Armstrong. In 1937 he opened his nightclub Le Boeuf sur le toit (\\"The Ox on the Roof\\") in Brussels where his orchestra \\"Jean Omer Jazz Orchestra\\" (with 16 to 18 musicians) performed alongside other jazz bands. The same year, pianist and composer Stan Brenders formed his own orchestra for the NIR-INR, officially named the Big jazz orchestra of Belgium (Het grote jazzorkest van Belgi√´ - Le grand orchestre jazz de Belgique). The rhythm section gained international fame and was even compared with that of Count Basie. This orchestra played several jazz compositions and film music in a typical American swing style. In 1938, Hans Philippi founded the Antwerp Jazz Club (AJC). In 1939 the 'Band battle' took place, an exchange concert with the famous Dutch band The Ramblers playing on the NIR-INR and the orchestra of Stan Brenders playing at VARA in Hilversum. Brenders, who played solid swing numbers, won the 'battle' in a convincing way. Later in life, Brenders would make a lot of recordings for radio and also had the opportunity to work with Django Reinhardt. He also acquired fame as a composer, with songs like \\"So Many People\\" and \\"I envy\\" performed by Nat King Cole. The \\"Symphonic Jazz Orchestra of Belgium\\" (Symfonisch Jazz Orkest van Belgi√´ - Orchestre Jazz Symphonique de Belgique) - with 40 musicians - was founded by him. Many new bands emerged as a result of the activities of these three jazz musicians (Candrix, Brenders and Omer) and for many musicians the great pre-war big bands and other ensembles ensured a fixed income. The arrangements were usually supplied by the aforementioned Peter Packay and David Bee. And then there was the classically trained musician Frank Engelen, an excellent guitarist but also a well respected composer and arranger. He wrote notable compositions such as 'Badinage', 'Bagatelle ', 'La Piste', 'Avondschemering' (Twilight) and 'Studio 24'. =1940-1960= The 1940s During World War II jazz music was banned by the occupying Germans and therefore was forced to go underground. Even so, it seemed to flourish more than ever. Belgian orchestras continued to make new recordings and new bands kept popping up. Few records reached Europe, and of course no American bands were touring Belgium. This situation forced the public to settle for homegrown musicians and these much sought-after bands were often very successful. Jazz musicians were clever enough to 'adjust' the names of the songs they recorded to work around the official ban on American music. Thus, for example, Honeysuckle Rose was renamed \\"Rose de Miel\\" and Stardust was recorded as \\"Poussi√®re d'√©toile\\". There were also new jazz organizations such as the \\"Swing Club de Belgique\\" and the club \\"Sweet and Hot\\". The major big bands like Robert De Kers and his Cabaret Kings performed regularly in the Brussels Centre for Fine Arts and in the hall of the Antwerp Zoo. After the liberation in 1945 the jazz scene in the United States had changed, and \\"bop\\" (or bebop) had become the latest thing. Characterized by its virtuosity, harmonic complexity and tempo changes, bebop brought about a stylistic revolution. The big names were now Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker, and Europeans learned about this new style of jazz when American records became available. In Belgium swing music was at its peak. The Belgian 'Lady of Swing' was Lucy Barcey. She was accompanied by the band of De Kers, among others. After the war, jazz became popular throughout Europe. In 1946 Don Redman‚Äôs orchestra toured in Europe, followed in 1947 by Sidney Bechet (visiting Antwerp and Brussels) and Louis Armstrong. Likewise, the bands of Duke Ellington, Lionel Hampton, Count Basie and others would regularly visit Belgium. Jazz in the form of dance music, mostly swing, was now played in bars, clubs and various venues by the Belgian bands of Boyd Bachmann, The Jump College, Henry Segers and his Belgian stars, Ernst van 't Hof, Jeff De Boeck and others. These orchestras could count on a large crowd of spectators wherever they came, because the soldiers of the liberation armies appreciated the music of the often highly professional Belgian bands. A number of jazz musicians also turned to the new bop style. In the period after 1950 there was a renewed interest in Europe for the old styles, especially for New Orleans music. At the New Orleans Dixieland festival in Paris in 1954 the Dixie Stompers from Mons were on the bill. Many American musicians went to Belgium (and to Europe in general) in the early 1950s to live and perform there. Conversely, Belgian jazz musicians also enjoyed success in the States, among them guitarist and harmonica player Toots Thielemans, vibraphonist Fats Sadi, trumpet player Sandy Herman and saxophonist Jack Sels. Other Belgians toured in Europe with American bands, among them singer Yettie Lee who went to Paris with Roy Eldridge. Bop, modern jazz, also found fertile ground in Belgium. Guitarist Bill Alexander teamed up with bassist John Warland and recorded Charlie Parker's Ornithology in 1946, one of the first bebop recordings in Europe. One of the major bands playing in that style was The Bob Shots from Liege, with Toots Thielemans as a guitarist. Some of the best jazz musicians in Belgium at one time played in this band: the talented flautist and saxophonist Bobby Jaspar, saxophonist Jacques Pelzer and guitarist Ren√© Thomas. Bobby Jaspar was later influenced by musicians like Stan Getz and 'converted' to the cool jazz school. In his short career (he died at the age of 37) he played with such greats as Chet Baker, Kenny Burrell, Miles Davis, John Coltrane and Donald Byrd. In 1934 the Belgian gypsy guitarist Django Reinhardt formed the quintet Hot Club de France with the French violinist St√©phane Grappelli, his brother Joseph and Roger Chaput on guitar and Louis Volla on bass. At the outbreak of the war, during a tour in England, Django left Grappelli behind and returned to Paris, where in 1940 he recorded his famous song Nuages with jazz saxophonist and clarinetist Hubert Rostaing. After the war, in 1946, Django Reinhardt went to the States where he performed and recorded with jazz greats like Duke Ellington. Together with Charlie Christian and Wes Montgomery, he is now - even outside jazz - considered one of the most influential guitarists ever. Django's style, jazz manouche or gypsy jazz, keeps attracting new jazz musicians all over the world, and the number of bands playing in this style is still growing. In Belgium, Fapy Lafertin probably is he best known representative of modern jazz manouche. The Django d'Or awards, originally organized in Paris as a tribute to Django Reinhardt, now ranks samong the most prestigious jazz prizes awarded to deserving musicians. Since the 1990s more countries outside France organize their own Django d'Or awards. In Belgium the Gent Jazz Festival and Dinant Jazz Nights in turn organize Django d'Or awards, alternatively honoring Dutch and French speaking musicians and bands. The 1950s The early 1950s in the United States was the period of cool (or west coast) jazz, more peaceful than bebop, and with a more outspoken interest in composition and arrangement. The Antwerp saxophonist Jack Sels became the leader of the All Stars Bop Orchestra, inspired by the Afro-Cuban big bands of Dizzy Gillespie and Stan Kenton. Later, he would organize his Jack Sels Chamber Music band. In Paris, Sadi also started up his own big band, for which he composed and arranged. In jazz circles he was considered the best European vibraphonist, in the tradition of Milt Jackson. Francy Boland managed to distinguish himself in the United States, where he worked with the bands of Count Basie and Benny Goodman, and with jazz pianist Mary Lou Williams. Bobby Jaspar remained a wonderful \\"cool\\" soloist on flute and tenor sax. In New York he played, among others, with J.J. Johnson and Miles Davis. Shortly before his untimely death in 1963, he set up a last vigorous quintet with his friend and guitarist Ren√© Thomas from Liege. Ren√© Thomas also crossed the Atlantic and ended up recording with Sonny Rollins in 1957. His most loyal partner and friend was Jacques Pelzer who, after the adventure with the Bob Shots, imposed himself in this decade as an outstanding musician of European jazz. At the end of the 1950s there were three young musicians who came to prominence on the Belgian jazz scene. Drummer F√©lix Simtaine (1938) debuted in the quartet of Robert Jeanne and then accompanied a series of American and Belgian soloists. Richard Rousselet (1940) was Belgium's first modern hardbop trumpet player, and would collect several awards abroad. Guitarist Philip Catherine (1942), even before his twentieth year, jammed at la Rose Noir, played at the festivals of Comblain and Ostend and toured Europe with Lou Bennett. After 1965 he also started to compose. =The 1960s= The 1960s saw the emergence of free jazz in the United States and the rise of the supremacy of rock. The popularity of jazz music after the golden days of swing was waning everywhere and now seemed to eclipse in favor of more danceable popular music. Most people did not like to hear bebop or freejazz, and jazz had become the music of a few insiders. Not only was the audience for jazz shrinking, but it also lost young jazz musicians who in previous periods had taken initiative, and now were more attracted to pop. Of course, besides showing interest in free jazz (also called \\"New Thing\\"), most Belgian musicians continued to play the older styles (New Orleans was especially popular in Flanders) and bebop (cool jazz included), while mainstream swing was still in demand. Apart from Fred Van Hove (piano), Babs Robert (alt sax), Jos√© Bedeur and some others, the Belgian jazz musicians did not really participate in free jazz, which had more followers in Germany and the Netherlands. The orchestra of the RTB disappeared in 1965, but was taken over by that of the BRT, led by Etienne Verschueren. In the absence of employment in Belgium a lot of musicians were associated with orchestras abroad. Jacques Pelzer worked in Italy, touring with Chet Baker; Toots Thielemans worked in Germany and Sweden, composed his hit Bluesette, and then returned to the U.S. in 1964; Ren√© Thomas set up a new quartet with Jaspar, played with Pelzer and Lee Konitz at European festivals, before falling back into a lean period in 1966. Still, despite these tough times for jazz, a few young musicians managed to get noticed: Jean-Pierre Gebler (bariton sax), Robert Graham (guitar), Marc Moulin (piano), John Linsman (trumpet), Robert Pernet (drums), Bruno Castellucci (drums) and Snowy Struvay (trumpet). New clubs opened: the Blue Note and Pol's Jazz Club in Brussels, the Jazz Inn in Liege, and the Jazz Clu Hnita in Heist-Op-Den-Berg. Large outdoor gatherings called \\"festivals\\" were organized. Comblain-la-Tour is the oldest: the first edition took place in 1959. =The 1970s= Although rock still dominated in the 1970s, musical styles began to interpenetrate. With Miles Davis, jazz electrified and flirted with rock. In the United States the new style was baptized \\"jazz-rock\\", giving rise to European bands like the British group Soft Machine. A number of Belgian artists are associated with this style, also called \\"Fusion\\": Philip Catherine, Jack Van Poll, Jacques Pelzer, Richard Rousselet, Robert Jeanne and Felix Simtaine. Some musicians of the new generation made it their niche: Marc Moulin, Michel Herr (piano), Charles Loos (piano), Paolo Radoni (guitar), Steve Houben (alt sax, flute), Janot Buchem (electric bass ) and Micheline Pelzer (drums). Typical for jazz rock is the replacement of acoustic instruments (guitar, bass and piano) by their electric version. These new sounds had the advantage of bringing the rock audience closer to jazz. The recording of jazz music took a new start, often by independent labels. Popular groups at that time were Placebo (Marc Moulin), Cosa Nostra (Jack Van Poll), Open Sky Unit (Pelzer), Kleptomania and Arkham (Radoni), Solis Lacus (Herr), Cos and Abraxis (Loos). In 1971, Ren√© Thomas returned to the forefront by joining Stan Getz' new quartet. Meanwhile, Toots Thielemans was touring and recording in the U.S., with Quincy Jones, Paul Simon, Bill Evans and others. In Flanders, Etienne Verschueren toured with his sextet. Up to approximately the 1970s jazz history was more or less a succession of stylistic periods, a development that was entirely situated in America. Jazz had become an international language. From the late 1980s on it became difficult to describe the direction jazz has taken. So many different jazz styles and trends exist that the student of jazz does not get a clear view on this fragmented musical landscape. =The 1980s= At the turn of the 1980s, jazz came back in force, although it did not find its way to the general public. This return is due in part to the emergence around 1984 of the compact disc, enabling reissues of many jazz classics; the illustrious labels (Blue Note, Pacific, Verve, Impulse!..) were again widely available. However, the total sales of jazz records (about 3-5%) remained low, and attendance to clubs did not profit from the new media. The theme of jazz came up more regularly in advertising and in the daily and weekly press, as well as on the radio. Television still did not pay much attention to jazz. The best sign of this new found health, at European level, was the appearance - and even, in some countries like France, proliferation - of new festivals in the late 1970s, and especially in the 1980s. Festivals originated in this period are: the festivals of Gouvy, Franchimont, Mortroux, Ostend, Brosella, Rossignol (Gaume Jazz Festival), Oupeye (Jazz au Ch√¢teau), the Belga Jazz Festival, the Festival des Lundis d‚ÄôHortense. =Present time= Belgium has yielded a relatively high number of world-class jazz musicians: Philip Catherine, Steve Houben, Bert Joris, Charles Loos, Jean-Louis Rassinfosse, Michel Herr, Philippe Aerts, Peter Hertmans, Erwin Vann, Nathalie Loriers, Ivan Paduart, Phil Abraham, David Linx, Diederik Wissels, the Brussels Jazz Orchestra, Aka Moon... And the tradition is kept alive by a new generation of young and promising musicians in a variety of jazz styles: old-style mainstream, big band, bebop, all forms of modern jazz like the ‚Äò‚Äôjazz rock‚Äô‚Äô, avant-garde and free improvisation, Latin jazz and electric Brazilian fusion, acid jazz, world jazz, etc.. Furthermore, musicians of the older generation who are still alive and kicking keep making notable records and are performing at a high level. Toots Thielemans for one is still prominent on the jazz scene. In 2009 he was one of the main attractions during the Night of the Proms in Antwerp, and in March 2010 he played eight shows at the Blue Note Festival in New York. Composer/pianist Jef Neve, born in 1977, has quickly become a prominent figure of Belgian jazz, and his international reputation is still growing. The famous British jazz critic Stuart Nicholson wrote of him: \\"His very personal approach to the piano trio announces the arrival of a huge promising young musician that has the potential to become an important voice in the European jazz scene to be.\\" In 2012, there were three leading Belgian jazz magazines: Jazz'halo, Jazz Around (the French partner of Jazz'halo) and Jazzmoza√Øek, sponsored by the Flemish government. An important organization for the promotion of jazz was Centrum De Werf in Bruges, managed by Rik Bevernage. De Werf organizes jazz concerts, mainly for American and Belgian jazz musicians. According to jazz impresario Jos Demol, the publisher of Jazz'halo, the Belgian jazz scene is generally spoken strongly focused on American jazz.Interview for AllAboutJazz Only a few musicians did their own thing and found their own way: Fred van Hove, Kris Defoort and Gilbert Isbin for example. Demol also noted little real interaction between clubs from different countries, although the differences are sometimes marked with stereotypes as \\"the clownish Italians\\", \\"the romantic French\\", \\"the ironic Dutch\\" and \\"the straightforward Germans\\". According to Demol, Belgian jazz could benefit from a mutual influence of styles. The Brussels Jazz Orchestra big band orchestra wrote Belgian jazz history when at the end of March 2012 it was invited to a series of gigs in the famous New York Blue Note Jazz Club. Up to that date, only one Belgian had had the privilege, and that Belgian was, of course, Toots Thielemans. At the educational level, self-education that characterized previous generations, is now increasingly replaced by training in schools, at workshops and seminars. Several Belgian musicians are traveling to the United States to attend classes at Berklee College in Boston, the most famous jazz school in the world. Nowadays, jazz teaching is also organized in Belgium. At the initiative of Henri Pousseur, the Li√®ge Conservatory organized a Jazz Seminar, which would run from 1979 to 1985. Many young emerging musicians were formed there, as well as in the class of Improvisation by Garrett List. Today, the Jazz Studio in Antwerp and the Brussels Conservatory provide jazz education at an advanced level. The international competition for young jazz ensembles and composers in Hoeilaart, \\"Europ Jazz Contest Hoeilaart\\" for a long time was the only significant Belgian jazz competition, but today there is also the contest \\"Jong Jazz Talent\\" (Young Jazz Talent) in Ghent.

The brand was founded by Lowell Harder in 1998. Justin Stead is the current CEO of the brand and was appointed in May 2015.<ref name=\\"basics\\"> History =Early years= Radley founder and current Creative Director, Australian Lowell Harder, began working in the accessories industry as a weekend stall holder on London's Camden Market in 1984 selling Indian men's accessories brand Hidesign. Harder began working with the Hidesign design team and together developed new designs for the UK market. Harder's business with Hidesign soon outgrew its market stall setting and needed increased investment and infrastructure which was supplied by the handbag company Tula Group in 1991. With the backing of the Tula Group, Harder was able to continue with Hidesign and in 1997, with a new working partner, develop a new women's accessories brand, Radley. ‚ÄòHarder launched it [Radley] in 1998 after becoming \\"fed up\\" with seeing bags in the same colours ‚Äì such as black and navy. Instead she wanted to create something different and colourful,' wrote Drapers trade magazine in an interview with Harder in 2012. Initial sales of Radley were low, however through a pre-existing relationship with Department store John Lewis via Hidesign, John Lewis began to trial a selection of Radley designs. Radley became a success for John Lewis, which then led to an interest from other UK based department stores. Scottie dog logo In an October 2012 interview with Drapers trade magazine, Radley founder Lowell Harder said of the conception of the brand's dog shaped logo 'we were experimenting with different things and one of the designers came-up with it. We hung it off a bag and people loved it.' The dog logo, which hung from the bag strap, was put on a few ranges in the collection for Autumn/Winter 2000 but was added to most of the range by 2001 because of increased interest from customers. After the departure of Harder in December 2010, the new design team implemented a new version of the dog logo which saw a negative reception from the consumer. In her October 2012 Drapers magazine interview, she explained why the original design of the logo was reinstated on her return 'He was changed after I left and was made too butch. The idea of him was that he was meant to look cute and fun so we are going back to that‚Ä¶it was important to us that we changed him back.' First buy-out With the increased sales of Radley in 2002, Harder led a buyout of Tula Group from its founding members. Tula and Hidesign were maintained as brands Second buy-out Phoenix Equity Partners purchased a majority stake of Radley in a ¬£45m deal in March 2006. It was listed again for sale the following December in 2007. The majority stake was purchased in a second buyout by private equity fund Exponent Private Equity in a transaction valued at ¬£130m. Exponent Private Equity presently maintains their majority ownership to this day alongside Radley's management team and Phoenix Equity Partners reinvested as minority stakeholders. Retail =UK= The company's first store opened in 2005 on London's King's Road. There are currently 19 full-price Radley stores and 14 outlets in the UK. The brand is also currently stocked in a number of other retail locations and department stores across the UK including British retailers Fenwick Ltd, John Lewis and House of Fraser. =International= Radley is currently stocked in Germany, Switzerland, Japan, Russia, South Africa, Thailand, and New Zealand. The bags are also available at Macy‚Äôs in the United States. =Online= Radley started online trading in 2007 and is currently stocked online in the UK by John Lewis, House of Fraser, Next and Shop Direct. Rebranding The company re- branded in Autumn 2009 to Radley London. Collaborations In 2013, Radley collaborated with the Scottish fashion designer Holly Fulton for a capsule collection of accessories. In 2010, and again in 2013, Radley announced a partnership with Harris Tweed, to incorporate the Scottish textiles into their handbag designs. There have also been capsule collections with the Victoria & Albert Museum and illustrators William Grill, Emma Cowlam and Rory Crichton. Brand ambassadors From Spring/Summer 2012 through to Spring/Summer 2013, Vogue UK's contributing Editor Laura Bailey was Radley's Brand Ambassador. The partnership also saw the launch of two capsule collections co-designed by Bailey. For Autumn/Winter 2013, British model Erin O'Connor appeared in Radley's UK advertising campaign. Product offering The brand currently produces handbags, small leather goods, luggage, hats, scarves, gloves, eyewear, casual footwear, watches, gifts and stationery. Radley launched their signature fragrance Radley London in March 2015. The fragrance is available in an Eau De Parfum, body wash and body lotion. Charity =British Heart Foundation= Radley has maintained a working relationship with the British Heart Foundation, a UK based cardiovascular research charity, over the last five years. In that time Radley has produced two capsule collections with a portion of the proceeds being donated to the charity.
