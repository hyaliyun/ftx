The Rollin film also covers the interior of the larger container; if it were not sealed, the helium II would creep out and escape. The liquid helium is in the superfluid phase. As long as it remains superfluid, it creeps up the inside wall of the cup as a thin film. It comes down on the outside, forming a drop which will fall into the liquid below. Another drop will form‚Äîand so on‚Äîuntil the cup is empty. A Rollin film, named after Bernard V. Rollin, is a 30 nm-thick liquid film of helium in the helium II state. It exhibits a \\"creeping\\" effect in response to surfaces extending past the film's level (wave propagation). Helium II can escape from any non-closed container via creeping toward and eventually evaporating from capillaries of 10‚àí7 to 10‚àí8 meters or greater. Rollin films are involved in the fountain effect where superfluid helium leaks out of a container in a fountain-like manner. They have high thermal conductivity. The ability of superfluid liquids to cross obstacles that lie at a higher level is often referred to as the Onnes effect, named after Heike Kamerlingh Onnes. The Onnes effect is enabled by the capillary forces dominating gravity and viscous forces. Waves propagating across a Rollin film are governed by the same equation as gravity waves in shallow water, but rather than gravity, the restoring force is the van der Waals force. The film suffers a change in chemical potential when the thickness varies. These waves are known as third sound.

With its capital mandate and instruments, UNCDF offers ‚Äúlast mile‚Äù finance models that unlock public and private resources, especially at the domestic level, to reduce poverty and support local economic development. This last mile is where available resources for development are scarcest; where market failures are most pronounced; and where benefits from national growth tend to leave people excluded. UNCDF's financing models work through two channels: savings-led financial inclusion that expands the opportunities for individuals, households, and small businesses to participate in the local economy, providing them with the tools they need to climb out of poverty and manage their financial lives; and by showing how localized investments‚Äîthrough fiscal decentralization, innovative municipal finance, and structured project finance‚Äîcan drive public and private funding that underpins local economic expansion and sustainable development. UNCDF financing models are applied in thematic areas where addressing barriers to finance at the local level can have a transformational effect for poor and excluded people and communities. By strengthening how finance works for poor people at the household, small enterprise, and local infrastructure levels, UNCDF contributes to SDG 1 on eradicating poverty with a focus on reaching the last mile and addressing exclusion and inequalities of access. At the same time, UNCDF deploys its capital finance mandate in line with SDG 17 on the means of implementation, to unlock public and private nance for the poor at the local level. By identifying those market segments where innovative financing models can have transformational impact in helping to reach the last mile, UNCDF contributes to a number of different SDGs and currently to 28 of 169 targets. Established by the General Assembly in 1966 and with headquarters in New York City, UNCDF is an autonomous UN organization affiliated with UNDP. As part of its inclusive finance practice area, UNCDF's CleanStart programme helps a woman in Uganda to reach solar lighting solutions in off-grid areas. The original UNCDF mandate from the UN General Assembly (UNGA) is to ‚Äúassist developing countries in the development of their economies by supplementing existing sources of capital assistance by means of grants and loans‚Äù (General Assembly Resolution 2186, 13 December 1966). The mandate was modified in 1973 to serve first and foremost but not exclusively the LDCs. The current Executive Secretary of UNCDF is Judith Karl.  History  Former logo of UNCDF. Created by the General Assembly in 1966 to promote economic development, UNCDF officially was established as an \\"autonomous organization within the United Nations\\" with the purpose to \\"assist developing countries in the development of their economies by supplementing existing sources of capital assistance by means of grants and loans\\". In 1973, the Governing Council reorients UNCDF's activities towards \\"first and foremost the least developed among the developing countries\\" and it began focusing on the world's least developed countries in 1974. For the next twenty years, UNCDF financed stand-alone capital infrastructure‚Äîroads, bridges, irrigation schemes‚Äîmostly in Africa. It received about $40 million in core funding per year and operated out of UNDP country offices. In the mid-1990s, UNCDF began focusing on the role local governments could play in planning, financing, and maintaining capital investments. Promoting effective infrastructure investment and service delivery via decentralized public financial management has been UNCDF's mainstay ever since. UNCDF's other major area of expertise‚Äîmicrofinance‚Äîalso dates to the mid-1990s, when many of its rural development projects had credit components. UNCDF's resources remain modest compared to many multilateral organizations. However, it has developed a considerable track record of going where others do not, and then ‚Äúleveraging in‚Äù larger sources of public and private capital. In the words of a 2008 assessment by the Government of Sweden, ‚ÄúUNCDF should be seen as a development actor that paves the way for others, rather than a financing mechanism.‚Äù In 2013, UNCDF received the highest score in the SmartAid for Microfinance Index, a measure of overall effectiveness in microfinance. UNCDF today operates in 31 of the world's 47 least developed countries. 70 percent of its portfolio is in Africa. On 13 December 2016, UNCDF commemorated its 50th Anniversary.

Delta Mendota Canal, in blue, runs southwest to northeast, in the central part of the map. The Delta‚ÄìMendota Canal is a aqueduct in central California, United States. The canal was designed and completed in 1951 by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation as part of the Central Valley Project to supply freshwater to users downstream of the San Joaquin River. Freshwater is diverted into the Madera Canal and Friant-Kern Canal at Friant Dam. The canal begins in the Northwestern region of the San Joaquin Valley, and east of the Cascade made from mostly concrete and a slope of 3 inches per mile. At the C.W. Bill Jones Pumping Plant (formerly the Tracy Pumping Plant), roughly of water is obtained from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. The canal runs southward along the western edge of the San Joaquin Valley, parallel to the California Aqueduct, and diverges to the east after passing the San Luis Reservoir, receiving more water and eventually emptying into the San Joaquin River near the city of Mendota. The canal travels through 6 state counties, Alameda, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Merced, and Fresno counties. Clifton Court Forebay provides added water to the flow of the canal.  History  After years of drought, the state of California highlighted the importance of a large-scale water project, thus creating the California State Water Plan, but eventually being taken over by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation in 1931 due to the Great Depression. In 1937 the Central Valley Project was approved by Congress to deliver freshwater throughout the San Joaquin Valley. The Friant-Kern Canal east of Fresno was built to distribute water through the eastern parts of the Central Valley, however, altered the natural flows of the San Joaquin River between the Friant Dam and confluence of the Merced River. The Delta‚ÄìMendota Canal was approved for the exchange of water rights in the downstream portion of the San Joaquin River. With the use of the Tracy Pumping Plant, water from the Sacramento River would be diverted into the Delta‚ÄìMendota Canal. The United States Bureau of Reclamation and the San Luis Delta Mendota Water Authority are responsible for maintaining the water quality that is discharged at the south end of the canal. The Delta‚ÄìMendota Canal is also a key feature to the Delta Division Project which is managed by the Bureau of Reclamation, to minimize salt intrusion from the San Francisco Bay. Due to the length of the canal, it required several contracts to complete the construction. The first contracts given by the Bureau of Reclamation were to the Morrison Knudsen Company, Inc., and the M.H. Hasler Construction Company, who worked on the stations 185+00-231+00 and 243+00-774+00 Next series of contracts were awarded to Hubert H. Everist for station 686+00-1365+00, and workers went on strike against the subcontractor Fred J. Maurer and Son. Other contractors were the Columbia Pumping Plant, Mowry Pumping Plant, United Concrete Pipe Corporation, Western Contracting Corporation, A. Teichert & Sons, Inc. General work shifts consisted of 3 daily shifts, twenty-one hours a day, 6 days a week. The pumping plants in the Delta Division have serious impacts on the flow of the Delta and San Joaquin River Basin. During relatively dry years and a high exportation rate, flow of the San Joaquin River has been reversed. This flow reversal confuse migratory fish, and bring saline water.  Water movement  An important feature of the Central Valley Project, with regards to directing water southward through the Delta‚ÄìMendota Canal is the C.W. Bill Jones Pumping Plant, formerly known as the Tracy Pumping Plant (TPP). The pumping station is 60 miles (96 km) to the southeast from the City of San Francisco, in the rural community of Byron, California, near the city of Tracy. Water is extracted from the southern portion of the San Joaquin Delta, and pumped to contractors in the San Joaquin Valley, San Benito and Santa Clara counties to meet urban and agricultural demands. Nearly 200 feet of water is extracted from the Delta per day, and with the use of two 15 foot diameter pipes, six 22,500-horsepower motors, roughly 8,500 Acre-feet (AF) of water can be transported southward daily. The plant is named to honor a pioneer in water management for the San Joaquin Valley, and was president of the San Luis and Delta-Mendota Water Association for two decades. = Use = The water is pumped from the canal into O'Neill Forebay, and then is pumped into San Luis Reservoir by the Gianelli Pumping-Generating Plant. Occasionally, water from O'Neill Forebay is released into the canal. The Delta‚ÄìMendota Canal ends at Mendota Pool, on the San Joaquin River near the city of Mendota, west of Fresno. The Delta‚ÄìMendota Canal capacity is and gradually decreases to at its terminus. Average annual throughput is . = The Intertie Project = In order to improve water delivery in the State of California, an intertie, which is defined as a connection between 2 or more current utilities, was constructed between the Delta‚ÄìMendota Canal and the California Aqueduct. The Intertie was constructed in the rural agricultural region of the southwestern portion of the San Joaquin Valley in Alameda County, near the city of Tracy, California. A series of two 108 inch diameter pipes of 500 feet in length connect the state managed California Aqueduct and the federally managed Delta‚ÄìMendota Canal. The pipes have a capacity to pump 467 cubit feet of water per second from the California Aqueduct to the Delta‚ÄìMendota Canal. This amount of water restores 35,000 acre feet of water annually to the Central Valley Project. The pumps use vertical power, which are more efficient than horizontal pumps, as it removes the need for a gearbox, as well as requires less maintenance and space. The four pumping units are from Cascade Pump Company from Santa Fe Springs, California, Pump Model 48MF with a 48-inch diameter discharge, with the capability to pump 55,125 gallons per minute. Due to the structural deficiencies of the C.W. Bill Jones Pumping Plant, The Intertie improves the overall water delivery system, and allows maintenance and emergencies to be addressed easier. Completion of the project was April 2012. The cost of construction was an estimated $29 million, and will be repaid by the contractors who purchase water. = Protecting fish species = Another key feature of the is the Tracy Fish Collection Facility. In order to protect threatened and endangered species, a series of sloughs, channels, and tanks, help capture the fish and safely reintroduce them into the Delta waterways. Constructed in the 1950s, its objective is to protect aquatic fauna from being injured or killed by the pumps that facilitate water to the south of the state. The facility is roughly 1 km east from the Pumping Plant, and became operational 1957. Most common fish species safely moved through the series of louvers are American shad, Splittail, White Catfish, Delta smelt, Chinook salmon, and Striped bass. Historical trends show a decrease in efficient fish diversion, and it is believed due to poor water quality, increased water pollution, changes in water operations, and change of water demands for the various water users. Due to those reasons, a new fish facility is being designed.  Land subsidence  Land subsidence is prevalent throughout the San Joaquin Valley, but was unrecognized prior to the construction of the canal. After construction, discrepancies in elevation were believed to be caused by earthquake. Post construction years, the southern 30‚Äì40 miles of the canal exceeded subsidence of 6 feet. Nearly two-thirds of the canal has been impacted by subsidence, over 20 miles of the concrete lined canal, and all the earth lined portion. By 1966, 35 miles demonstrated a drop of 1 feet, 3 feet elevation drop in 15 mile stretch, 5 foot decrease in a 5-mile portion, and 2 feet of the canal demonstrated a drop of 6 feet. Land subsidence in the region is due to constant over-drafting of underground water. Another key factor is due to the San Joaquin Valley's geomorphological structure, having young continental, unconsolidated sandy-silty-clayish soils, resting on old unconsolidated marine beds. Impacts of the land subsidence lead to a decrease between bridges and water level surface. In regions of greater subsidence, portions of bridges, pipes, and cattle guards would be inundated. Unfortunately, land subsidence has led to a decrease in total water conveyance capacity available within the canal. No major negative impacts to the integrity of the structure of the canal have been noted, though minor issues requiring additional maintenance have been report.  Recirculation feasibility study  The U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation evaluated the ability to improve water quality, energy consumption and production, productive fisheries, and flow to the San Joaquin River with the use of recirculation strategies using the Central Valley Project facilities. The Recirculation Feasibility Study Project was authorized by CALFED (California Federal Bay-Delta Program) Bay-Delta Authorization Act of 2004 (118 Stat. ¬ß¬ß 1681‚Äì1702.; Public Law 108-361). History has shown that low precipitation patterns can lead to pumping stations reversing the flow in the San Joaquin River, that negatively impacts fish migration patterns.  Recreational activities  Fishing access is provided in Canal Site 2A in Stanislaus County and Canal Site 5 in Fresno county, both providing parking and restrooms. Many use the gravel road adjacent to the canal for biking and walking. No water-contact activities aside from fishing are allowed. * *United States Bureau of Reclamation *USGS annual flow data References Category:Aqueducts in California Category:Central Valley Project Category:Irrigation in the United States Category:Agriculture in California Category:Geography of the San Joaquin Valley Category:Sacramento‚ÄìSan Joaquin River Delta Category:United States Bureau of Reclamation Category:1951 establishments in California Category:Infrastructure completed in 1951 ","title":"Delta‚ÄìMendota Canal"},{"id":"2157184","text":"Ludwigia helminthorrhiza, known commonly as floating Ludwigia, originally known as Jussiaea natans Bonpl. or Jussiaea helminthorrhiza C.

The village has a wide variety of properties, with a wide range of building techniques and ages. Due to its availability, local red sandstone features heavily in buildings, both ancient and modern. The village has a 16th-century inn (the Rising Sun), a village hall, and a number of establishments offering accommodation. History The origin of the village name is open to some debate and is thought to either come from the name \\"Begas Barrow\\" (meaning badger's hill) or from an amalgamation of the family name \\"Baga\\" and the Old English word for hill, \\"beorg\\". In either case, by 1086, when the Domesday Book was compiled, the name had become Bageberge. Around Wills Neck and the Triscombe Stone are several bowl barrows and cairns dating from the Bronze Age. The parish of West Bagborough was part of the Taunton Deane Hundred. Enclosure of lands within the parish was authorised by an Act of Parliament in 1806. In October 2001 a hoard of 4th-century Roman silver was discovered in the village. The 681 coins included two denarii from the early 2nd century and eight miliarense and 671 siliqua all dating from the period AD 337 ‚Äì 367. The majority were struck in the reigns of emperors Constantius II and Julian and derive from a range of mints including Arles and Lyons in France, Trier in Germany and Rome. It became known as the West Bagborough Hoard.

History The charter for West Monkton was given to Glastonbury Abbey by the Saxon king Centwine in 682. The monks from the abbey gave the village its name Monkton, and it was called West as being west of the other estates of the abbey. The parish of West Monkton was part of the Whitley Hundred. After the dissolution of the monasteries the manor was granted to William Paulet, Marquess of Winchester, passing in 1616 to the Warres of Hestercombe and in 1872 to Viscount Portman of Orchard Portman. Milling at Bathpool in the River Tone had a chequered history. There had been a mill at this location for several centuries, which had been rebuilt or adapted as required. In March 1812, the structure was burnt down by a fire, caused, according to the Taunton Courier, by \\"the excessive friction excited in the stones used in the process of shelling clover seeds\\". Stocks of flour, grain and flax valued at ¬£2,500 were destroyed. The mill was rebuilt and later owned by Captain George Beadon. The mill was purchased by Thomas Redler in 1889 on the death of Beadon, but another fire damaged much of it two years later. Redler rebuilt it with safety in mind, and installed a steam-driven turbine as water levels were often inadequate to power the wheels. Two more turbines followed, and the water wheels were removed. Steam from the turbines was also used to heat bread ovens, which were amongst the first in the country to be heated in this way. In September 1915, another fire gutted the building, which was not rebuilt, and the ruins were demolished in the 1920s.Tony Haskell, (1994), By Waterway to Taunton, Somerset Books, In the 1820s the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal was constructed. The work included the construction of several bridges to carry roads over the canal, one of which is now the A38 road. During the restoration of the canal in the 1980s the condition of the swing bridge at Bathpool caused a change in policy. There were objections to the plan to replace it with a fixed bridge with limited headroom, and the planning application was deferred.

Geography Wiveliscombe is a former borough, market and cloth making town,The woolen industry at Wivelscombe specialized in rough kerseys and baize, which were traded to Bristol and London and exported to Guernsey and Spain (Collinson, p. ). from the border between Devon and Somerset. It is situated at the foot of the Brendon Hills and acts as a gateway to Exmoor. At an altitude of Wiveliscombe is the highest town in Somerset. The town used to have a station on the Devon and Somerset Railway which closed in 1966. Clatworthy Reservoir is nearby. Demography The town's population in 1777 was 1,533.Collinson, p. 188. While the modern population of 2,893 is small for a town, its shops and services meet the needs of a much larger population, spread through the western fifth of Taunton Deane, in scattered farms and villages. A survey in 1997 revealed that there were at least 300 businesses within a radius of the town; 14 of these were trading internationally and a further 20 nationally. Wiveliscombe is also home to two breweries, Cotleigh Brewery and Exmoor Ales. It is also one of the first towns in the UK to set up a completely free goods and services exchange forum for the local ten parishes area. The community radio station 10Radiohttp://www.10radio.org/ Community Radio for the 10 Parishes is based in the town, serving the community of the ten parishes from which its name is derived. 105.3FM in the local area and via the internet at www.10radio.org. Churches The tower of the Church of St Andrew The previous parish church was valued in 1292 at 12 marks.Collinson, pp 486ff. The present church, dedicated to St Andrew, is a grade II* listed building. It was built in 1827-9; the architect was Richard Carver who had it built from red sandstone with Hamstone dressings. Its octagonal font originated in the 14th century, and in the churchyard is a 14th-century sandstone cross. The oldest place of worship in Wiveliscombe is the Congregational Chapel in Silver Street, built in 1708 as the Independent Chapel. It joined the Congregational Union of England and Wales in 1838, and is now used by the Wiveliscombe Evangelical Congregational Church. This chapel was built because the Independent Meeting House (built in 1689 after the Act of Toleration) had become too small. This earlier Meeting House was demolished sometime after the First World War, when North Street Motors was built on the site. This has now closed, and the premises are currently being used as a garden shop. Education Wiveliscombe Primary School serves most of the surrounding villages. Kingsmead School, for pupils aged 11 to 16, houses a Theatre and Sports Hall and a youth club complementing the town's Recreation Ground where the Tennis, Rugby, Cricket and Football Clubs have their bases.

The land for the park was acquired from private owners under the State Parks Bonds Program during 1968 and opened to the public in 1972. In addition to being a state park, it is also a National Natural Landmark. Eastward-dipping limestones, sandstones, and mudstones of the Glen Rose Formation were deposited during the early Cretaceous Period approximately 113 million years ago along the shorelines of an ancient sea, and form the geological setting for the park area. Over the last million years or so, these layered formations have been eroded, dissected and sculpted by the Paluxy River which, in many places, has cut down to resistant beds and planed off sizable exposures of rock in the river bottom.  Controversy  Near Dinosaur Valley State Park, in the limestone deposits along the Paluxy River, \\"twin sets\\" of tracks were found in the Glen Rose Formation as early as 1908. These footprints were once thought to be evidence that humans and non- avian dinosaurs lived at the same time, but now are identified to be created by dinosaurs. However, young-Earth creationists continue to believe that humans and non-avian dinosaurs lived at the same time, a notion that is contrary to the standard view of the geological time scale. Biologist Massimo Pigliucci has noted that geologists in the 1980s \\"clearly demonstrated that no human being left those prints,\\" but rather \\"they were in fact metatarsal dinosaur tracks, together with a few pure and simple fakes.\\"Massimo Pigliucci, Denying Evolution: Creationism, Scientism, and the Nature of Science, (Sinauer, 2002, page 246): The family of George Adams, who claimed to have found human footprints in the Glen Rose Formation, later admitted that Adams' and some others' fossil footprints were a hoax. Zana Douglas, the granddaughter of George Adams, explained that during the 1930s' Great Depression her grandfather and other residents of Glen Rose made money by making moonshine and selling \\"dinosaur fossils\\". The faux fossils brought $15 to $30 and when the supply ran low, they \\"just carved more, some with human footprints thrown in.\\" See also * Geology * Paleontology * Trace fossil * Sedimentary structures * List of Texas state parks References  External links  * Dinosaur Valley State Park, official website * A guide to the state park by Glen J.

UNRISD was established in 1963 with the mandate of conducting policy- relevant research on social development that is pertinent to the work of the United Nations Secretariat, regional commissions and specialized agencies, and national institutions. A small team of researchers coordinates UNRISD‚Äôs research programmes, which focus primarily on the developing world, working in collaboration with national research teams from local universities and research institutes. The Institute‚Äôs work takes a holistic, multidisciplinary and political economy approach. UNRISD‚Äôs location at the United Nations Office at Geneva gives researchers access to channels of policy influence through active participation in events, meetings, conferences and working groups. History UNRISD was established in 1963 ‚Äúto conduct research into problems and policies of social development, and relationships between various types of social development and economic development‚Äù. It was originally set up with a grant from the Government of the Netherlands, and its first Board Chair was the eminent economist Jan Tinbergen, who received the first-ever Nobel prize for economics in 1969. UNRISD‚Äôs initial research focused on the design of indicators to measure development not just in terms of economic growth but also social factors, such as nutrition, health and education. As such, it employed many statisticians in its early years. Another early project focused on cooperatives as a tool for development, which produced some controversial results. In the 1970s, global population growth made food production, supply and eventually food systems into a key topic in development. UNRISD‚Äôs work on the so-called Green Revolution (the introduction of newly bred high-yield grain seeds to increase food production) took a typically critical view. It highlighted the fact that the quantity of food available was only one factor in ensuring populations in developing countries were not subject to hunger. Power inequalities impacting on the distribution of foodstuffs played a key role in determining who got enough to eat and who didn‚Äôt. By the 1980s, UNRISD was growing in size, in terms of both funding and staffing. Its remit diversified to cover popular participation and refugee issues, gradually leaving some of its early preoccupation with statistics behind. In the 1990s UNRISD thrived. A wide range of topics were addressed, ranging from political violence to the socioeconomic impact of illicit drugs. Globalization in the modern era and structural adjustment programmes in developing countries brought about social crises which UNRISD researched and criticized, arguing that unregulated markets required a healthy public sector and stable governance to function properly. Environmental issues took firm root in development debates during this decade. UNRISD‚Äôs take was typically critical: whatever the benefits of conservation, it was often happening at the expense of social justice and the livelihoods of minorities. In the 2000s, as globalization continued apace and social dimensions began to be re-introduced in the face of the sometimes catastrophic impacts of wide-ranging economic liberalization, UNRISD criticized a narrow social policy focus on safety nets and the targeting of vulnerable groups, arguing instead in favour of universal transformative social policy. In the 2010s, the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by UN member states in 2015 established new global roadmap for development. UNRISD continued to work on social policy, often in conjunction with questions related to the 2030 Agenda. It also took up the new issue of the social and solidarity economy (SSE) and its contribution to sustainable development. Output on gender issues since 2016 fell due to a lack of gender capacity in-house following staff restructuring. Environmental issues are re-emerging as a key area of work, especially as they relate to social policy and climate justice. UNRISD themes and projects The current research agenda is shaped by three major contemporary development challenges: inequalities, conflict and unsustainable practices. It consists of three programmes: *Social Policy and Development *Gender and Development *Social Dimensions of Sustainable Development These programmes pursue a variety of projects including the following, some of which are recently completed, others are still underway: *Understanding Gender-Egalitarian Policy Change: When and Why Do States Respond to Women‚Äôs Claims-Making? (2010‚Äì2014) *Politics of Domestic Resource Mobilization for Social Development (2011‚Äì2018) *Potential and Limits of Social and Solidarity Economy (2012‚Äì2013) *New Directions in Social Policy: Alternatives from and for the Global South (2013-2018) *Innovations in Care Policies (2015‚Äì2016) *Valueworks: Effects of Financialization along the Copper Value Chain (2017-2018) *Social and Solidarity Economy for the SDGs: Spotlight on the Social Economy in Seoul (2017-2018) *Just Transition Research Collaborative Phase 1 (2018) *SSE Knowledge Hub for the SDGs (2018-2019) *Overcoming Inequalities in a Fractured World: Between Elite Power and Social Mobilization (2018-2020) *Sustainable Development Performance Indicators (2018-2022) *Transformative Adaptation to Climate Change in Coastal Cities (2019) *South-South Migration, Inequality and Development Hub (2019-2023) UNRISD has recently introduced a new way of sourcing projects in the form of an ‚ÄúIdeas Incubator‚Äù, in which it actively seeks partners to expand its research portfolio. Publications UNRISD makes its research widely available through books (in partnership with publishers like Routledge, Palgrave Macmillan and Wiley Blackwell), research papers and occasional papers (which are peer-reviewed) and working papers (which are not peer-reviewed). UNRISD researchers also regularly contribute articles to scholarly journals. These publications are typically of interest to an academic audience. Other publications target an audience of policy-makers, programme designers and decision-makers. These take the form of briefs, whether research and policy briefs, or briefs concerning a specific project, issue or event. UNRISD maintains on online open access repository with over 1300 publications, in the form of the publications section of its website. The majority of items published after 1990 can be downloaded free of charge. Others are books which can be obtained from the publisher. Some of these publications have received international recognition, success and incorporation into major global debates. UNRISD regularly publishes flagship reports which synthesize a significant body of recent research. =Key publications: Flagship reports= *UNRISD. 2016.

UNRISD, Geneva UNRISD events UNRISD frequently convenes conferences and seminars, as a means of refining and developing its research and to disseminate its findings. Its events are often closely linked with its policy impact, being the forums where development policy makers and practitioners can come into contact with academics working on social development. =Recent major UNRISD conferences= In November 2018 UNRISD held a major international conference in Geneva which convened innovative research from the global South and North. The title of the conference was ‚ÄúOvercoming Inequalities in a Fractured World: Between Elite Power and Social Mobilization‚Äù. Keynote speeches were given by Fran√ßois Bourguignon and Vandana Shiva. The conference was preceded by a roundtable discussing whether elites are the engines of inequalities, featuring Naila Kabeer (London School of Economics), Saskia Sassen (Columbia University) and Jomo Kwame Sundaram (Council of Eminent Persons, Malaysia). As part of the celebrations of its 50th anniversary, UNRISD co-hosted a conference with the ILO (International Labour Organization) in 2013 entitled ‚ÄúThe Potential and Limits of the Social and Solidarity Economy‚Äù. The conference featured prominent speakers such as Guy Ryder, Jose Luis Coraggio, Paul Singer and Sarah Cook. Over 40 academics presented research findings to about 400 participants. There were several side events including a PhD poster session, book presentations, a practitioners‚Äô forum, movie screenings and a special session on alternative finance and complementary currencies hosted by the UN-NGLS. In 2011, UNRISD organized a conference held in Geneva on climate change as a social development issue called ‚ÄúGreen Economy and Sustainable Development: Bringing Back the Social Dimension‚Äù. The conference created a forum for developing a conceptual and policy framework to position social dimensions at the centre of green economy and sustainable development. Policy reports and other publications prepared for this conference informed the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) preparatory process and subsequent policy discussions. =Seminar Series= In addition to its international conferences, UNRISD organises a regular Seminar Series to provide a space for open, informed and insightful conversation around contemporary issues of concern to social development research and policy. Recent seminars have included: * Blockchain for Inclusive and Sustainable Development: Fact or Fantasy? - Helen Hai (Blockchain Charity Foundation and UNIDO Goodwill Ambassador); Ivonne Higuero (UNECE); Leander Bindewald (MONNETA / Network for Monetary Diversity) * Changing Course for Sustainable Development: Bold Alternatives to Business as Usual - Gita Sen (DAWN); Kate Donald (Center for Economic and Social Rights); Sandra Vermuyten (Public Services International); Ziad Abdel Samad (Arab NGO Network for Development) * The Challenge of Leaving No One Behind: Securing Political Commitment for Inclusive Development - David Hulme (academic) (University of Manchester); Sam Hickey (University of Manchester); Sohela Nazneen (Institute of Development Studies, UK) * Towards a Post-Neoliberal World Order: Rebuilding Human Rights-Based Multilateralism - Jeremy Corbyn (MP, United Kingdom); Arancha Gonzalez (Executive Director International Trade Centre); Nikhil Seth (Executive Director UNITAR) Outreach and communication In recent years, UNRISD‚Äôs outreach and communication strategy has focused on four core objectives: * Increase the visibility of UNRISD as an institution; * Promote the use of its research findings; * Translate research findings into strong messages that can be communicated to a range of audiences; * Document and communicate the impact of UNRISD work. Communication of the research findings has proven to be a key component in strengthening the ultimate purpose and impact of UNRISD activities as well as increasing recognition and use of UNRISD research by the UN system, academia, civil society, and funding bodies. UNRISD is currently active on LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter; on the last of these it has recently reached 31,000 followers. UNRISD also produces multimedia material as a means of making seminars and conferences available through online videos and podcasts Policy influence and impacts UNRISD‚Äôs position within the UN system allows it a significant degree of policy influence, while its governance structure and funding situation (see below) give it more latitude for independence than other UN entities enjoy. Its staff serve on UN system-wide committees, task forces and expert groups, and undertake collaborative research with other UN agencies. UNRISD's independent international events, conferences, seminars and symposiums (see above) are held in order to discuss and present research findings and debates in select fields of focus. These events often draw in the participation of local and international NGOs, government representatives, the media, universities and other research institutes, as well as individual researchers and academics. UNRISD events have also been co-hosted and co- organized with co-operating universities, NGOs and local governments. This extensive cooperation with social development stakeholders is one of the Institute's key channels of policy influence and impact. In 2014, UNRISD published a brochure detailing the impact of its work in terms of its agenda- setting capacity, its multiple spheres of influence, and its networking and capacity building.Ideas to Impacts, UNRISD 2014 UNRISD Staffing Structure UNRISD has a small core staff, located in Geneva, Switzerland, which coordinates an international network of collaborating researchers. Collaboration with UNRISD may take one of several forms. Original research may be directly commissioned for a centrally coordinated research project. Alternatively, researchers can respond to a Call for Papers and submit research already underway for publication as part of an UNRISD project. UNRISD also publishes think pieces on its website by collaborating scholars. UNRISD‚Äôs network of currently active collaborating researchers numbers over 400, with a large proportion from the global South. Governance UNRISD is overseen by a Board, headed by a Chairperson who is appointed by the UN Secretary-General. Board members are selected based on their expertise and qualifications, and membership is confirmed by the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). Board members participate in their individual capacity and do not represent UN member states. The Board reports to the Commission for Social Development biennially. Chairs of the Board * Jan Tinbergen, Netherlands (1963‚Äì1974) * H.M.A. Onitiri, Nigeria (1975) * M.T. Diawara, C√¥te d'Ivoire (1976‚Äì1982) * K.A.

This arrangement, while fluctuant, at the same time guarantees the Institute‚Äôs independent status and gives it a certain critical latitude. The following governments have contributed to UNRISD over the past 50 years: Australia, Austria, Canada, Cuba, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Iran, Iraq, Italy, Jamaica, Mexico, the Netherlands, Nicaragua, Norway, the Republic of Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Yugoslavia.

Nicolaas van Nieuwland, or Nicolas Van Nienlant (1510 in Maartensdijk - July 15, 1580 in Utrecht), was a Roman Catholic prelate who served as bishop of Haarlem and abbot of Egmond Abbey from 1562 to 1569 and as Auxiliary Bishop of Utrecht (1541‚Äì?).\\"Bishop Nicolas Van Nienlant\\" Catholic-Hierarchy.org.

Gabriel Chow. Retrieved February 29, 2016 Biography Van Nieuwland became bishop when he was still young. On 6 Jul 1541, Nicolas Van Nienlant was appointed during the papacy of Pope Paul III as Auxiliary Bishop of Utrecht and Titular Bishop of Hebron. On 11 Sep 1541, he was consecrated bishop by George van Egmond, Bishop of Utrecht, with Nicolas Bureau, Auxiliary Bishop of Tournai and Titular Bishop of Sarepta, and Pascase Maupair, Titular Bishop of Selymbria, serving as co-consecrators. It is uncertain how long he served as Auxiliary Bishop of Utrecht. =Move of the Reguliers= In 1550 he managed the move of the Reguliers, monks from the monastery in Stein, South Holland (where Erasmus was educated) to a Double monastery (also housing the Bridgettines) in Gouda. The former home of the reguliers in Land van Steyn, (:nl:Klooster Emma√ºs te Stein), had been lost in a fire in 1549. The convent they moved to in Gouda, was renovated for them by order of George van Egmond and the former sacristy was remodeled into a choir which housed eleven stained glass windows (today on display in seven windows in the Janskerk (Gouda) in the extra room called the Van der Vorm kapel). Despite these renovations, the Regulierskerk did not survive long after that, because the monastery reverted to the state after the Protestant Reformation in 1580 and the church was torn down. For centuries the Catholic Hofje (:nl:Hofje van Buytenwech), which was founded on the grounds of the monastery in 1563, was allowed to remain on the Raam in Gouda, but this too was finally torn down in 1958. In 1580, before destroying the Regulierschurch, the expensive stained glass windows and the accompanying cartoons were moved to the Janskerk, where they were most recently restored in 1922 and given a separate chapel. =Diocese Haarlem= In 1559 a new diocese was introduced, the diocese Haarlem, and Nicolaas van Nieuwland became bishop of this new diocese on November 6, 1561. He entered the city on February 1, 1562 with a formal procession. Van Nieuwland also became abbot of Egmond Abbey at the same time. At the time that Van Nieuwland was in Haarlem, the Protestant Reformation was gaining ground in the Northern Netherlands, and Haarlem was a seat of unrest due to the school there under the leadership of Dirck Volckertszoon Coornhert. Van Nieuwland was faced with a slowly shrinking Catholic population as the townspeople reverted to Protestantism and followed Coornhert, who sided with Lamoral, Count of Egmont and William the Silent, against the Catholic leaders of Van Nieuwland, the newly appointed Frederik V Schenck van Toutenburg, who received his orders from Philip II of Spain. Van Nieuwland's protector George van Egmond had died in 1559. Perhaps because of these developments, he became an alcoholic, and is registered as walking in processions drunk, earning him the local nickname Dronken Klaasje. He was asked to step down in 1569, and he was replaced by Godfried van Mierlo. Van Nieuwland returned to Utrecht, where he later died.

A swing bowler, he had a relatively short international career but is remembered for a Test debut in 1972 at Lord's where he took eight wickets in each innings, with figures of 16/137 for the match. This was a world record for a Test debutant until beaten by India's Narendra Hirwani, who took 16 wickets for just 1 run fewer. The parallels go deeper ‚Äì neither man enjoyed an extended Test career; between the two of them, they played fewer than 25 Test matches. Style Massie was regarded for his work ethic and thinking ability. An upwind bowler, he was known for his ability to swing the ball late in both directions. His nickname was \\"Ferg\\" ‚Äì from the well known tractor brand Massey-Ferguson. Early years The son of Arnold and Barbara Massie, Bob began playing cricket at age ten at the Bedford Park Youth Club, while a student at Hillcrest Primary School. He moved on to Mount Lawley Senior High School and joined Bassendean-Bayswater in Western Australia‚Äôs club competition. Massie made his debut for Western Australia against South Australia in 1965‚Äì66. He made a duck in his first innings and conceded 81 runs without taking a wicket. He did not play another Shield match for the season, nor did he play again for Western Australia that year, but went to join Kilmarnock in the Scottish league. He also trialled with Northampton in English County cricket, but was not signed after he played two matches in the second XI for a total of 3/166. First class breakthrough He was not to regain his state place until an away trip to the eastern seaboard in 1969. In his first match upon his return against South Australia, he took match figures of 4/75. His performance in the season was unspectacular, taking less than 15 wickets in the 1969‚Äì70 Australian season. When the touring England played Western Australia in the early stages of the 1970‚Äì71 season, Massie went wicketless and found his match opportunities restricted with Graham McKenzie back from international duty. He was recalled for a match against Queensland at the WACA Ground, taking match figures of 8/95 to ensure his place in the state side. At the start of the 1971‚Äì72 Australian season he gained a position in the Australian team for the second match against the Rest of the World team in Melbourne which had been quickly organised after the touring South Africans were banned due to apartheid. Massie took three wickets. In the following match in Sydney, he took 7/76 in 21 overs including the scalp of Gary Sobers to secure his selection in the squad for the 1972 Ashes tour. 1972 Ashes tour and Test debut Massie took 6/31 in the opening first class match of the tour against Worcester, but was not selected for the First Test due to injury. He took 8/84 and 8/53 in his Test debut in the Second Test at Lord‚Äôs to square the series for Australia. His display of swing bowling yielded him the third best match figures of all time up to then, 16/137 (behind Jim Laker‚Äôs 19/90 and Sydney Barnes‚Äô 17/159) and the best ever match figures on debut (later bettered by one run by Narendra Hirwani‚Äôs 16/136). Utilising his experience playing for Kilmarnock, he bowled a consistent line and length, stating \\"it could hardly have been better experience than to play on the soft wickets in the Scottish League\\". His performance was marked by a heavy emphasis on bowling around the wicket to the England batsmen. It was a tactic devised at Old Trafford where he bowled that way to his team mate Ross Edwards in the nets. He took 23 wickets at 17 in the Tests, twice taking five in an innings and once ten in a match. He was unable to replicate his form in the remaining matches, his best being 4/43 in the Third Test. End of career Upon his return to Australia, he played only two more Tests in the 1972‚Äì73 season against Pakistan. He took eight wickets but it was his batting which attracted the most attention. With Australia faltering at 8/101 in its second innings in the Third Test, with only a 75 run lead, Massie combined with John Watkins to add 83. Massie made 42 and Australia managed to win the Test and the series. Massie‚Äôs health failed him on the 1973 West Indies tour and he was unable to recover his swing and accuracy. He played only a further five first class matches before retiring.

Born into poverty, he played at both professional and international levels, mostly as a centre-half. He spent the majority of his playing career at Ipswich Town, the club with which he won both the FA Cup and the UEFA Cup. He was also named the inaugural Professional Footballers' Association Young Player of the Year at the end of the 1972‚Äì73 season, and featured in the film Escape to Victory alongside many of his Ipswich teammates. Beattie's playing career took him from rags to riches, but according to The Daily Telegraph he was \\"cursed by being both injury and accident prone\\". His playing career included some controversy, notably when he went missing after being selected for England's under-23 team. After retiring from playing he descended into unemployment and alcohol abuse, and contemplated suicide, before finding purpose once more and a new career in later life, as a football commentator on television and radio. Beattie has been called Ipswich Town's best ever player by many pundits and polls. Ipswich (and later England) manager Bobby Robson called him the best England player he had seen. Early life Thomas Kevin Beattie was born in Carlisle on 18 December 1953. His family lived in the Botcherby estate and he was one of nine children: five boys and four girls.Finch, pp. 10‚Äì11. He became known by his middle name, as his father was also named Thomas Beattie.Finch, p. 13. Beattie's mother was a cleaner at a Lipton tea shop, whilst his father worked for the National Coal Board, delivering coal. The elder Thomas played amateur football as a goalkeeper and once had a trial with Aston Villa, but turned down an offer to join the club as he could earn more working for the Coal Board. After he was forced to give up work due to a back problem, the family suffered financially and were often short of food, leading to the young Beattie taking fruit and vegetables from local allotments.Finch, pp. 14‚Äì15. In later life, he recalled, \\"There was often only food on the table when Dad had backed a winning horse, or else won a game of darts, or dominoes down at his local pub.\\"Finch, p. 11. Beattie supported his local football team, Carlisle United, and idolised players like Hughie McIlmoyle. He recalled being \\"devastated\\" when McIlmoyle was too busy to sign an autograph outside the club, resolving never to turn down such requests.Finch, p. 20. Beattie attended St Cuthbert's Roman Catholic junior school, where he began playing football for the school team, initially as a goalkeeper.Finch, pp. 15‚Äì19. His family were unable to afford the football boots he needed, but a teacher named Mr Raffety bought a pair for him. Beattie soon became a forward and modelled himself on Chelsea's Peter Osgood.Finch, pp. 20‚Äì22. Although Beattie passed his eleven-plus exams, his family could not afford the grammar school uniform, so he moved to St Patrick's Roman Catholic senior school. He began playing for Blackfriars, a local youth team managed by Raffety, and also, from the age of 14, for a pub team, alongside his father. Raffety recommended him to Carlisle United, but the club did not have a youth team. Beattie was also told that Celtic had shown an interest in him, but the club had been wrongly told that he was not a Catholic, the traditional religion of the majority of the club's fanbase. He left school aged 14, and subsequently worked as a machine fitter and delivery boy in factories, a warehouse, a dry cleaner and then a furniture company.Finch, pp. 27‚Äì28. Club career =Ipswich Town= Youth At the age of 15, Beattie was playing for Blackfriars on Sunday and for a club called St Augustine on Saturdays, when he was spotted by a football scout and offered a trial with Liverpool. Beattie travelled to Liverpool and impressed manager Bill Shankly sufficiently for him to be invited back to sign for the club. Beattie returned to Liverpool on his own, but nobody from the club arrived to meet him at Lime Street station. After waiting an hour and assuming they had lost interest, and with nothing but his boots and train ticket, he returned home to Carlisle.Finch, pp. 23‚Äì25. Shankly would later describe missing out on signing the youngster as one of his biggest mistakes. Soon after this, Beattie joined Ipswich Town as an apprentice. Ipswich manager Bobby Robson made sure that he was met at Euston station in London, played in a youth match at Fulham, and was accompanied all the way to Ipswich's Portman Road ground by the club's chief scout, Ron Gray.Finch, pp. 28‚Äì30. Robson told Gray, \\"If you miss him, you've lost your job\\". The poverty Beattie came from was evident when he arrived in Ipswich wearing his father's shoes, so when Ipswich signed him, the club immediately bought him some clothes. As a youth he had played as a striker, but Robson converted him into a defender, usually a centre-half; the player said in later life that the move suited him well, as it meant he could see all the play in front of him. Bobby Robson, Beattie's first professional manager and a lifelong admirer of the player Now earning a wage, Beattie tried to help support his family, sending money home each week.Finch, p. 36. He also stepped in to prevent domestic violence between his parents: \\"I became extremely upset when I found out that Dad was spending the money that I had been sending home on drink and Mum was going without. Not only that but I also found out that his drinking had got worse and he had started knocking Mum around.\\" Senior Beattie was given his first-team debut aged 18 against Manchester United in the opening match of the 1972‚Äì73 season in England's top division. Ipswich won the game 2‚Äì1, and afterwards he asked United's Bobby Charlton for his autograph; Charlton told Beattie that his play reminded him of Duncan Edwards and that, in years to come, he would be the one signing autographs. Beattie scored his first league goal for the club two weeks later at Elland Road in a 3‚Äì3 draw with Leeds United. That season he featured 38 times for Ipswich in the league and scored 5 goals;Hayes, p. 17. Ipswich ended in fourth place, their best finish since the Championship-winning 1961‚Äì62 season under Alf Ramsey. Beattie was also part of the 1972‚Äì73 Texaco Cup-winning team, which defeated Norwich City 4‚Äì2 on aggregate over two legs, and he was named the inaugural winner of the Ipswich Town Player of the Year award.Hayes, p. 183. The following season saw Beattie's first appearance in a European competition, with Ipswich having qualified for the UEFA Cup as a result of their fourth position in the league the previous season. He played in aggregate victories over Real Madrid (1‚Äì0), Lazio (6‚Äì4) and FC Twente (3‚Äì1), before the side lost on penalties to Lokomotive Leipzig, Beattie having scored his first European goal in the home leg.Finch, pp. 47‚Äì51. He appeared in all 42 league games for Ipswich that season (along with Mick Mills), made 15 other appearances in cup competitions,Finch, p. 171. and was presented with the inaugural Professional Footballers' Association's (PFA) Young Player of the Year award.Hayes, p. 18. He was also once again voted his club's Player of the Year. Early in the 1974‚Äì75 season Beattie was involved in mild controversy against Stoke City when his tackle at Portman Road broke John Ritchie's leg. In the return fixture at Stoke's Victoria Ground, Beattie's teammate Allan Hunter was involved in an incident that left Stoke's Denis Smith with a broken leg.Finch, pp. 56‚Äì58. The crowd erupted in anger, directed at Beattie; Robson noted \\"There was a cauldron for 20 minutes. Kevin Beattie had to beat 28,000 people out there.\\" Later that season, Beattie was awarded the captaincy for a game, against his home team Carlisle United.Finch, p. 58. Having played 52 games and scored 6 goals during the season for Ipswich, he was elected by his peers as a member of the First Division Team of the Year.Lynch, p. 140. He had helped his club reach the semi-final of the 1974‚Äì75 FA Cup and to finish the league season in third position.Finch, p. 66. Beattie made 36 appearances for Ipswich during the 1975‚Äì76 season, scoring 4 goals. Ipswich finished sixth and were knocked out of the 1975‚Äì76 FA Cup in the fourth round.Finch, p. 77. Towards the end of the season, he began to suffer from severe back pain, something he blamed on an injury incurred as a child while helping his father carry sacks of coal.Finch, p. 79. Despite the relative lack of success with his club, he was selected in the First Division Team of the Year for the second year in a row.Lynch, p. 141. The 1976‚Äì77 season started well for Ipswich with victories over Liverpool and Manchester United. Ipswich then achieved a club record- equalling 7‚Äì0 win over West Bromwich Albion: the Albion goalkeeper John Osborne said of Beattie's long-range goal that he regarded himself as fortunate he had not touched it as it would have knocked his hand off.Finch, p. 80. Beattie's season was prematurely curtailed by a self-inflicted injury:Finch, p. 82. stoking a bonfire at his home, he decided to add petrol; the ensuing flare-up gave him serious burns to his face and neck,Finch, p. 84. leading to him missing six matches. Before the injury, Ipswich were challenging for the league title, but, in Beattie's absence, the side lost four of their last six matches and missed out on winning the championship by five points. He played in 34 games for Ipswich that season, scoring 5 goals, and was selected for the PFA Team of the Year for the third time in a row, along with teammates Mick Mills and Brian Talbot. Beattie was fit to play by the start of the 1977‚Äì78 season,Finch, p. 85. but a knee injury sustained in a league match led to him withdrawing from the England squad to face Luxembourg. Further investigation revealed he had damaged cartilage in his knee, which required an operation.Finch, p. 86. Having had three weeks' recuperation and a cortisone injection, he was restored to the Ipswich squad in time to play in the third round UEFA Cup home leg against FC Barcelona. Ipswich won the fixture 3‚Äì0, and even though he suffered a reaction in his knee, he insisted he was able to play in the away leg. Robson disagreed, and Beattie was left out of the side for the game; Ipswich were knocked out on penalties.Finch, p. 87. Cortisone injections became commonplace for Beattie, who returned to the team in time for the FA Cup fourth-round victory against Hartlepool.Finch, p. 89. Although Ipswich's form in the league was poor, they were safe from relegation by the time they faced West Bromwich Albion in the FA Cup semi- final at Highbury, a game for which Beattie was given the all-clear. A 3‚Äì1 victory saw Ipswich into the final, yet the next day his knee was once again swollen and his participation in the final was in jeopardy.Finch, p. 90. According to Beattie, \\"the boss secretly told me that if I felt fit enough to play then I was in\\".Finch, p. 92. Robson did not announce the Cup final team until the last minute: it included a formation change to include five midfielders and Paul Mariner as a lone striker ‚Äì and Beattie in defence.Finch, pp. 93‚Äì94. Roger Osborne's late goal for Ipswich was the only score of the game, and they won the trophy. Beattie had three cortisone injections to get through the final.Finch, p. 100. Following the cup final success, he and teammates Robin Turner and David Geddis were awarded the freedom of Carlisle.Finch, pp. 97‚Äì98. Beattie had represented Ipswich 21 times during the course of the season, without scoring a goal. Shortly into the 1978‚Äì79 season, Beattie suffered problems with his other knee. Two further operations followed, and he was confined to treatment and physiotherapy,Finch, pp. 100‚Äì101. only, in his words, \\"wheeled out for the really big games\\".Finch, p. 103. Overall, he made 26 appearances that season, scoring twice. The 1979‚Äì80 season saw him make just 12 appearances, twice as substitute, and score twice, as his post-match recuperation took weeks, not days.Finch, p. 104. He also played a \\"bit-part\\" in the 1980‚Äì81 season, usually as a striker instead of his usual position of centre-half. However, his defensive role in the two-leg victory over the Czechoslovakian team Bohemians, in the second round of the 1980‚Äì81 UEFA Cup, for which he was awarded man of the match, proved vital to Ipswich's season.Finch, pp. 108‚Äì109. Although irregularly selected as a result of his injuries, Beattie played in the fourth round, first leg 4‚Äì1 away victory over AS Saint-√âtienne, whose team included Michel Platini and Johnny Rep. Ipswich won the home leg 3‚Äì1 without Beattie. He played his last match for Ipswich in April 1981, in an FA Cup semi-final loss to Manchester City in which he broke his arm. Ipswich won the UEFA Cup at the end of the season, but Beattie was not presented with a winner's medal as he did not play in the final or even appear on the bench, through injury; 26 years later, a petition was organised by Rob Finch, the writer of Beattie's 2007 biography The Greatest Footballer England Never Had, calling on UEFA to right the wrong. Beattie was finally awarded a medal by UEFA president Michel Platini at the 2008 UEFA Cup Final between Rangers and Zenit Saint Petersburg. Beattie retired due to injury in December 1981, following five knee operations in four years. His testimonial game took place in March 1982, against a Dynamo Moscow XI. =Later career= In the off-season of 1982, Beattie began training with Norwich City under manager Ken Brown who offered him a short-term contract.Finch, p. 124. The offer was soon withdrawn because Ipswich were reluctant to release Beattie to their local rivals. Instead, he joined another East Anglian team, Colchester United, whose player-manager was Allan Hunter, a former team-mate of Beattie. Beattie made six appearances for the club, four of those in the league, but when teammate John Lyons committed suicide, Hunter resigned,Finch, p. 125. and Beattie decided to move on. He signed for Middlesbrough, where he made five appearances during that season, scoring once, a penalty, in a 2‚Äì0 FA Cup victory over Notts County. His time at the club ended when he suffered a serious groin injury whilst playing against north-east rivals Newcastle United.Finch, pp. 128‚Äì129. Dropping into non- League football, Beattie signed for Barry Fry's Barnet, joining another ex- England international, Steve Whitworth.Finch, p. 130. Injury and, according to Beattie, \\"a combination of the drink and depression\\" curtailed his spell at the club.Finch, p. 131. After failing to secure any coaching work, Beattie took up work as a labourer, and joined local team Harwich & Parkeston to supplement his income.Finch, p. 136. Accepting an offer from Ipswich's former scout Ron Gray, Beattie joined Swedish second-tier side Sandvikens IF under manager and former Swedish international player, Thomas Nordahl.Finch, pp. 136‚Äì137. Soon afterward, Nordahl suddenly resigned and the club let Beattie go. He moved to Norway, signing for fourth division club Kongsberg IF, where he scored more than 60 goals in his first season.Finch, pp. 137‚Äì138. He signed for Norwegian second division club Nybergsund IL-Trysil in 1988, making five appearances for them before moving back to England.Finch, pp. 139‚Äì140. He also played for Clacton Town. He assisted Mike Walker and Duncan Forbes at Norwich City as a scout during Walker's time as manager and performed a similar role for Alan Ball Jr. at Portsmouth.Finch, p. 148. Beattie's first foray into coaching was a part-time position at his hometown club Carlisle United under Roddy Collins in the 2002‚Äì03 season.Finch, pp. 151‚Äì152. Collins was sacked early in the 2003‚Äì04 season, and Beattie left the club, subsequently opting to coach school children in the United States.Finch, p. 153. His last coaching position was a short spell with Barry Fry at Peterborough United. International career Former Ipswich manager and then-England manager Alf Ramsey selected Beattie to represent the England under-23 team during the 1972‚Äì73 English domestic season.Finch, p. 42. He made his debut in November 1972 against Wales under-23s at Vetch Field in Swansea, England winning 3‚Äì0. His final under-23 game also saw his only goal at that level, in a 2‚Äì0 victory, once again over Wales, this time at the Racecourse Ground in Wrexham. Beattie's senior England debut came under Don Revie, a starting role in a 5‚Äì0 victory over Cyprus at Wembley in April 1975, especially notable for Malcolm Macdonald scoring all five goals. Beattie managed to put the ball in the net, but the goal was disallowed for a foul on the goalkeeper; ultimately, the only goal he scored for his country was in May 1975, during a 5‚Äì1 victory over Scotland in the 1974‚Äì75 British Home Championship. Perry Groves, who played alongside Beattie at Colchester United, describes how Beattie, ostensibly playing at left-back, emerged to meet a cross from Kevin Keegan, beat two Scottish defenders and \\"looped a great header\\" into the goal, voted one of the top 50 goals England have scored. His final game for England was in October 1977 against Luxembourg in a qualification match for the 1978 FIFA World Cup. In total, he earned nine caps between 1975 and 1977, scoring once. Style of play Perry Groves, who began his career playing alongside Beattie, included him in the book he wrote about his 20 \\"football heroes\\". Beattie was renowned for his strength, the nickname \\"Beast\\" reflecting that, but also his quality on the ball (with the resultant other nickname of \\"Diamond\\"). Robson described him as \\"the quickest defender I ever saw... with a left foot like a howitzer\\". Perry Groves noted that Beattie's only shortcoming appeared to be his inability to throw the ball far. When Beattie arrived at Colchester, \\"into his thirties\\" and with his knees \\"all shot\\", \\"he was still the quickest player at the club over ten yards by a long way.\\" Groves recalls Robson's summary of Beattie's strengths as a player: > What a player the boy was... He could climb higher than the crossbar and > still head the ball down. He had the sweetest left foot I've ever seen and > could hit 60-yard passes, without looking, that eliminated six opposition > players from the game. He had the strength of a tank, was lightning quick > and he could tackle. During his years with Ipswich, Beattie formed a central defensive partnership with Allan Hunter. Robson described them as 'Bacon and eggs'. Interviewed in 2018, Hunter talked about their partnership: > we just gelled and if I went and done things to attack the ball he was > always behind me ‚Äì and vice-versa. We didn't need to work at it because it > was something that came naturally... We were just a good partnership... me > and Beat would be sitting on the other side of a room from each other and we > would know what the other was thinking because there were times I would, or > he would, burst out laughing and the boys would say, what you bloody > laughing at? And we would say \\"mind your own business\\"... It helped on the > field because we didn't even have to talk because we knew each other's play. Incidents and controversies In December 1974, Beattie was involved in an incident that prompted newspaper headlines across the quality and tabloid press. Called up to represent England at under-23 level against Scotland under-23s at Pittodrie,Finch, pp. 60‚Äì61. Beattie was \\"put on the right train by his manager Bobby Robson\\", yet failed to arrive in Manchester. That Beattie was \\"found\\" playing dominoes with his father in a pub in Carlisle helped substantiate the story, although England manager Don Revie sent Beattie a telegram wishing him a happy birthday, the following day. Groves' account, 30 years later, is that when Beattie's train pulled into Carlisle station, he saw the name, felt homesick and went to visit his father. Media coverage at the time ascribed Beattie's lapses to pressure; factors cited included his then four-week-old daughter, his rags-to-riches climb and a virus. Subsequent reports that he then missed training for Ipswich, allegedly preferring to stay in bed when passed fit by the club doctor, fuelled the story further. Ipswich suspended him for one match. Beattie accepted a lit cigarette from a fan and smoked it whilst collecting his FA Cup winner's medal in 1978. According to Groves, Beattie smoked 20 cigarettes a day for the duration of his playing career; he also missed part of pre-season for Colchester because he \\"strained too much\\" while defecating, resulting in a pulled stomach muscle. Post- football, family life and death Beattie was unemployed on several occasions after finishing his playing career. Groves writes about how the unemployment office where Beattie would sign on was so close to Ipswich's home ground that he would see players arriving in their \\"flash motors\\", while he signed autographs. After running a pub, he began drinking very heavily and was on one occasion given the last rites when his pancreas \\"packed up\\". He considered suicide, but was able to care for his wife who was seriously unwell, and, according to Groves, managed to get \\"his life back on the right track\\". Nonetheless, Beattie became impoverished, and despite receiving ¬£50,000 from a testimonial match organised by Ipswich Town, he depended on financial help from the PFA. In later years, Beattie worked for broadcast media; he commented on football for BBC Radio Suffolk until the day before his death. He also co- wrote his autobiography, The Beat, published in 1998. In May 2012, Beattie was convicted of benefit fraud and given a 12-week curfew. He had failed to disclose his earnings from radio, for fear of losing Income Support. He later apologised and described it as a \\"silly mistake\\". Beattie met his future wife Margaret Boldy, known as Maggie, in the late 1960s or early 1970s in a youth club near to his apprentice accommodation, Beattie describing it as \\"love at first sight\\".Finch, p. 33. They married in 1974, and soon afterward she appeared in Radio Times in a \\"Footballers' Wives\\" feature; at that point the couple were still living in a \\"modest\\" club-owned house.Finch, p. 55. Maggie was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis during the mid-1980s; she was later confined to a wheelchair,Finch, p. 151. with Beattie as her carer in their council-owned bungalow. They had three daughters, Emma, Sarah and Louise. His playing career injuries gave Beattie difficulties in later life: by the time he was 53 he was \\"unable to walk more than half a mile\\", owing to the arthritis in his knees. He refused to bow to his difficulties: \\"Maggie, bless her, never complains\\", he said to a Daily Telegraph reporter, \\"so why should I feel any anger at how life turned out?\\". On 16 September 2018, Beattie died of a suspected heart attack at the age of 64. He was survived by his wife and daughters. His funeral was held at the crematorium at Nacton on 26 October 2018. Former Ipswich and England player Terry Butcher paid tribute to Beattie, calling him \\"the complete footballer\\" and describing his left-footed shot as an \\"Exocet\\". George Burley referred to Beattie as \\"a legend\\", while John Wark, whose nickname for Beattie was \\"Monster\\", described him as the best-ever Ipswich player. Legacy Beattie was once described by Bobby Robson as the best England player he had seen, and that he could have rivalled Duncan Edwards. Beattie was inducted into the Ipswich Town Hall of Fame in 2008, was voted numerous times as Ipswich Town's \\"best ever player\\", and features as one of Perry Groves' 20 \\"Football Heroes\\" in a book published in 2009. Along with some of his Ipswich teammates, Beattie featured in the 1981 film Escape to Victory. His skills were shown on the pitch as the body double for Michael Caine's prisoner-of-war character, and the two became friends. Beattie had a cooler relationship with Sylvester Stallone, who also starred in the film: \\"There weren't too many that got on that well with him and after I beat him in an arm wrestle ‚Äì first my right arm and then my left ‚Äì he didn't speak to me again\\". A campaign for a permanent memorial to Beattie to be placed outside Portman Road, along with the existing statues of Robson and Alf Ramsey, was started soon after his death by Ipswich Star and East Anglian Daily Times editor Brad Jones. The design for the statue was revealed on 19 March 2019. It was confirmed in August 2019 that the funds required to build the statue had been raised.

MGUS resembles multiple myeloma and similar diseases, but the levels of antibodies are lower, the number of plasma cells (white blood cells that secrete antibodies) in the bone marrow is lower, and it rarely has symptoms or major problems. However, since MGUS can lead to multiple myeloma which develops at the rate of about 1.5% a year, yearly monitoring is recommended. The progression from MGUS to multiple myeloma usually involves several steps. In rare cases, it may also be related with a slowly progressive symmetric distal sensorimotor neuropathy. Signs and symptoms People with monoclonal gammopathy generally do not experience signs or symptoms. Some people may experience a rash or nerve problems, such as numbness or tingling. Severe renal disease has also been found in a subset of those with monoclonal gammopathy. MGUS is usually detected by chance when the patient has a blood test for another condition or as part of standard screening. Pathophysiology Pathologically, the lesion in MGUS is in fact very similar to that in multiple myeloma. There is a predominance of clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow with an abnormal immunophenotype (CD38+ CD56+ CD19‚àí) mixed in with cells of a normal phenotype (CD38+ CD56‚àí CD19+); in MGUS, on average more than 3% of the clonal plasma cells have the normal phenotype, whereas in multiple myeloma, less than 3% of the cells have the normal phenotype. Diagnosis MGUS is a common, age-related medical condition characterized by an accumulation of bone marrow plasma cells derived from a single abnormal clone. Patients may be diagnosed with MGUS if they fulfill the following four criteria: # A monoclonal paraprotein band less than 30 g/l (< 3g/dl); # Plasma cells less than 10% on bone marrow examination; # No evidence of bone lesions, anemia, hypercalcemia, or chronic kidney disease related to the paraprotein, and # No evidence of another B-cell proliferative disorder. =Differential diagnosis= Several other illnesses can present with a monoclonal gammopathy, and the monoclonal protein may be the first discovery before a formal diagnosis is made: Management The protein electrophoresis test should be repeated annually, and if there is any concern for a rise in the level of monoclonal protein, then prompt referral to a hematologist is required. The hematologist, when first evaluating a case of MGUS, will usually perform a skeletal survey (X-rays of the proximal skeleton), check the blood for hypercalcemia and deterioration in renal function, check the urine for Bence Jones protein and perform a bone marrow biopsy. If none of these tests are abnormal, a patient with MGUS is followed up once every 6 months to a year with a blood test (serum protein electrophoresis). Although patients with MGUS have sometimes been reported to suffer from peripheral neuropathy, a debilitating condition which causes bizarre sensory problems to painful sensory problems, no treatment is indicated. Prognosis At the Mayo Clinic, MGUS transformed into multiple myeloma or similar lymphoproliferative disorders at the rate of about 1-2% a year, or 17%, 34%, and 39% at 10, 20, and 25 years, respectively, of follow-up‚Äîamong surviving patients. However, because they were elderly, most patients with MGUS died of something else and did not go on to develop multiple myeloma. When this was taken into account, only 11.2% developed lymphoproliferative disorders. Kyle studied the prevalence of myeloma in the population as a whole (not clinic patients) in Olmsted County, Minnesota. They found that the prevalence of MGUS was 3.2% in people above 50, with a slight male predominance (4.0% vs. 2.7%). Prevalence increased with age: of people over 70 up to 5.3% had MGUS, while in the over-85 age group the prevalence was 7.5%. In the majority of cases (63.5%), the paraprotein level was <1 g/dl, while only a very small group had levels over 2 g/dl. A study of monoclonal protein levels conducted in Ghana showed a prevalence of MGUS of approximately 5.9% in African men over the age of 50. In 2009, prospective data demonstrated that all or almost all cases of multiple myeloma are preceded by MGUS. In addition to multiple myeloma, MGUS may also progress to Waldenstr√∂m's macroglobulinemia, primary amyloidosis, B-cell lymphoma, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

This is the approximate resting spot of James Snook, and is marked by two stones. The headstone (foreground) was erected by the Boxmoor Trust in 1904, whilst the footstone was installed in 1994. Robert Snooks was the last man to be executed in England for highway robbery, on 11 March 1802. Born in Hungerford in Berkshire, he was christened as James Snook on 16 August 1761.Joan and Roger Hands (2004). Royalty to Commoners - Four Hundred years of the Box Moor Trust, page 18. pub. Alpine Press. Kings Langely. The fact that his name is commonly quoted as Robert Snooks is perhaps due to a corruption of his identity as the \\"Robber\\" Snook.  The crime  On the evening of Sunday 10 May 1801 post boy John Stevens, travelling from Tring to Hemel Hempstead, was entrusted with several mail bags of post.Joan and Roger Hands (2004). Royalty to Commoners - Four Hundred years of the Box Moor Trust, page 19. pub. Alpine Press. Kings Langely. Upon reaching an isolated part of Boxmoor, near Bourne End, he was threatened by a highwayman who stole from him six leather bags containing bank notes, promissory notes and letters. The highwayman took the money, of a value of ¬£80, and discarded the unwanted letters and bags, leaving them strewn across the moor. It was revealed in the London Chronicle of 11 March 1802, that the highwayman had also discarded his saddle with a broken girth strap on the moor, a mistake that would subsequently lead to the identification of the culprit.  Investigation and trial  The day after the theft, Postmaster and High Constable John Page (of the Kings Arms in nearby Berkhamsted) initiated investigations into the crime, it was then that several people came forward and stated they remembered seeing a man at the Kings Arms fixing a broken girth-strap on his saddle. It was believed that the culprit worked at the Kings Arms as an ostler, and would thus have some knowledge of the post boy's route. The culprit was identified as James Snook. By this time James Snook was already a wanted man, in connection with several highway robberies between Bath and Salisbury. He had also been indicted for horse-stealing at the Old Bailey in 1799, under what is assumed to be his full name of James Blackman Snooks. For this charge he was acquitted, due to lack of firm evidence. A reward of ¬£200 was offered by the Postmaster General in addition to the ¬£100 offered by Parliament for the apprehending of highwaymen. He was subsequently captured in Marlborough Forest on 8 December 1801, by William Salt, a post-boy who was driving a chaise through the forest. Salt recognised Snook, and managed to apprehend the thief with the help of his passengers. At this point, Snook had ¬£200 in his pocket, as well as 'a brace of very handsome pistols'.Joan and Roger Hands (2004). Royalty to Commoners - Four Hundred years of the Box Moor Trust, page 18. pub. Alpine Press. Kings Langely. John Stevens, was unable to positively identify Snook, as it was dark at the time of the robbery, as a result, there was only circumstantial evidence that linked Snook to the crime. This included one of the stolen bank notes being traced back to being in Snook's possession, when he accidentally gave it to a serving girl in Southwark whilst trying to purchase some cloth.Joan and Roger Hands (2004). Royalty to Commoners - Four Hundred years of the Box Moor Trust, page 18. pub. Alpine Press. Kings Langely. He was initially held in Newgate Prison, before being moved to Hertford Gaol on 4 March 1802 whilst awaiting trial. Five days later, the trial took place and he was found guilty. Whilst the typical punishment for highway robbery was transportation, due to Snook's crime being \\"of a nature so destructive to society and the commercial interests to the country\\", he was sentenced to be hanged.  Punishment  Snook's punishment took place two days after his sentencing, on public ground nearest to the scene of the crime, as the law required. It is believed that thousands of people flocked to see the hanging, and it was to some of this number that Snook's is reputed to have exclaimed \\"It's no good hurrying - they can't start the fun until I get there!\\" whilst on his way to the gallows.Joan and Roger Hands (2004). Royalty to Commoners - Four Hundred years of the Box Moor Trust, page 19. pub. Alpine Press. Kings Langely. Snook's body was dug up the day after his hanging, was interred in a coffin provided by the residents of Hemel Hempstead and unceremoniously re-interred on the moor. A small headstone (bearing the name 'Robert Snooks') was erected by the Box Moor Trust in 1904, whilst a footstone was installed in 1994, as part of the Trust's 400 year anniversary. The exactly location of Snook's hanging, and subsequent burial is unknown, so the location of the stones is an approximation.  Legacy  A pub in the nearby Pavilion in Hemel Hempstead, since demolished, was named after Snooks and used the silhouette of a mounted highwayman as its sign. One of the local Explorer Scout units is also named after him. In addition to the gravestones, the Box Moor Trust has also named one of the moors 'Snook's Moor', whilst the Estate Managers house is appropriately named 'Snook's End'. .

He appears to have been a friar of the Franciscan House at Ayr. Having joined the party of reform before 1541, he fled for his life to England. There he became noted as a zealous and taking preacher. This led to his arrest for heresy under an Act of Henry VIII., \\"for abolishing diversity of opinion\\" in matters of religion. He was found guilty of preaching against purgatory, holy water, priestly confession, and prayer to the saints, and of holding that priests might lawfully be married, he was for some time confined in the Fleet prison. After the accession of Edward VI he was chaplain to Henry, Duke of Suffolk, who had married King Henry's niece, and is best known as the father of Lady Jane Grey. He preached for a time in London, in St Katherine's Church, when both he and John Knox, his fast friend, were granted general license to preach anywhere in England. Henry, Earl of Huntingdon, presented him to the rectory of Loughborough in Leicestershire, a living which he continued to hold during King Edward's reign, and again during that of Queen Elizabeth for the rest of his life. Thus in his later years he was in the unique position of being at the same time a parish minister in both England and Scotland. When Mary Tudor came to the English throne in 1553, Willock fled to Embden, in the Protestant Duchy of Friesland. There he practised as a physician with much success, and rose to some eminence. In 1555, and again in 1556, the Duchess Anne of Friesland sent him to Scotland as her Commissioner on matters of trade. In 1558 he returned home, and preached for some time in Dundee, with much acceptance among the friends of reform. In 1559, when John Knox had to leave Edinburgh in peril of his life, Willook took his place as the evangelist of the Reformation. It was then that he conducted in St Giles what is believed to have been the earliest public celebration of the Holy Communion in Scotland after the reformed ritual. In 1560, when Queen Mary of Guise lay dying, the Earls of Argyll and Moray, and other Lords of the Congregation advised her to \\"send for a godly, learned man of whom she might receive instruction\\"; and Willock was chosen to minister to her, which he faithfully did. That same year he was made Superintendent of Glasgow and the West. He was also one of the six Johns entrusted with the drawing up of the First Book of Discipline, the others being John Knox, John Winram, John Spottiswood, John Douglas, and John Row. Sometime in that year he went to England, and brought home his wife, Katherine Picknavell, an English lady. He was chosen Moderator of the General Assembly in 1563, 1564, 1565, and 1568. In 1565 Queen Mary endeavoured to put a stop to his activity by having him imprisoned in Dumbarton Castle; but the Reformers were now too strong for her, and she had to depart from her purpose. After that, Willock went back to his English rectory at Loughborough. In 1567 the General Assembly sent him a strong letter of appeal, begging him to come again to aid the good cause. This led to his return, and he was Moderator of Assembly in 1568. He went again to Loughborough, and was there in 1570 when the Regent Moray was assassinated. Knox then wished much to have the aid of his old friend in the perplexities of the time, but Willock could not come. His letter to Knox tells of his sorrow at the loss of the good regent, and of his great admiration for that departed statesman. Early life He was a native of Ayrshire, but nothing is known of his parentage. He was educated at the University of Glasgow. For some time he was a friar in Ayr, according to Archbishop Spottiswoode of the Franciscan, but according to Bishop Lesley of the Dominican Order. He then embraced the reformed religion and went to London, where, about 1542, he became preacher at St. Catherine's Church and chaplain to Henry Grey, afterwards Duke of Suffolk, the father of Lady Jane Grey. East Frisia On the accession of Mary to the English throne in 1553 he went to Emden in East Frisia, where he practised as a physician. In 1555, and again in 1556, he was sent to Scotland on a commission to Mary of Guise, the Queen Regent, from Anna of Oldenburg, the Countess and Regent of East Frisia; but according to Knox his principal purpose in visiting Scotland was \\"to assaye what God wald wirk to him in his native country. While there he was present at the supper in the house of John Erskine of Dun, when a final resolution was come to by the leading reformers against attendance at the mass. He returned to East Frisia in 1557 During the Scots Reformation He finally settled in Scotland in 1558, when, although \\"he contracted a dangerous sickness,\\" he held meetings with several of the nobility, barons, and gentlemen, \\"teaching and exhorting from his bed\\"; and, according to Knox, it was the encouragement and exhortations of Willock in Dundee and Edinburgh that made \\"the brethren\\" begin \\"to deliberate on some public reformation,\\" and resolve to send to the queen regent an \\"oration and petition\\" on the subject. Afterwards Willock went to Ayr, where, under the protection of the Earl of Glencairn, he preached regularly in St. John's Church. On 2 February 1559 he was indicted for heresy before the queen regent and her council, and for failing to appear and continuing to preach at Ayr he was outlawed on 10 May following. In March 1559 a disputation was proposed between him and Quintin Kennedy, abbot of Crossraguel Abbey, at Ayr, but as they failed to agree on the method of interpreting scripture it did not take place (see correspondence between them in , and in . The sentence of outlawry of him and others was passed, notwithstanding the assembly of a large body of armed reformers at Perth, to whom a promise had been made that Willock and his friends would not be further molested; but the outlawry could not be rendered effective. Willock had come to Perth in company with the Earl of Glencairn, and while there he and Knox had an interview with the Earl of Argyll and Lord James Stewart (afterwards Earl of Moray), from whom they received an assurance that should the queen regent depart from her agreement they would \\"with their whole powers\\" assist and concur \\"with their brethren in all time to come\\". After the destruction of the monasteries at Perth, which followed the breach of agreement by the queen regent, Willock and Knox towards the close of June 1559 entered Edinburgh along with the Lords of the Congregation. Shortly afterwards Knox was elected minister of St Giles' Cathedral, Edinburgh; but after a truce had been completed with the queen regent it was deemed advisable that Knox should for a while retire from Edinburgh, Willock acting as his substitute in St. Giles. During Knox's absence strenuous efforts were made by the queen regent to have the old form of worship re-established, but Willock firmly resisted her attempts; and in August he administered the Lord's supper for the first time in Edinburgh after the reformed manner. After the queen regent had broken the treaty and begun to fortify Leith a convention of the nobility, barons, and burghers was on 21 October held in the Tolbooth to take into consideration her conduct, and Willock, on being asked his judgment, gave it as his opinion that she \\"might justly be deprived of the government,\\" in which, with certain provisos, he was seconded by Knox. The result was that her authority was suspended, and a council appointed to manage the affairs of the kingdom until a meeting of parliament, Willock being one of the four ministers chosen to assist in the deliberations of the council. After the Scots Reformation Not long afterwards Willock left for England, but he returned with the English army in April 1560, and at the request of the reformed nobility the queen regent had an interview with him on her deathbed in June following, when, according to Knox, he did plainly show her as well the virtue and strength of the death of Jesus Christ as the vanity and abomination of that idol the mass. By the committee of parliament he was in July 1560 named Superintendent of the West, to which he was admitted at Glasgow in July 1561. He was also in July 1560 named one of a commission appointed by the Lords of the Congregation to draw up the First Book of Discipline. Life in England As a Scottish reformer Willock stands next to Knox in initiative and in influence; but it is possible that the rigid severity of Knox became distasteful to him, and, apparently deeming the religious atmosphere of England more congenial, he about 1562‚Äîin which year he was, however, in June and December Moderator of the General Assembly‚Äîbecame rector of All Saints Church, Loughborough in Leicestershire, to which he was presented by Henry Hastings, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon. Nevertheless, by continuing for several years to hold the office of Superintendent of the West, he retained his connection with the Scottish church, and he was elected Moderator of the General Assembly on 25 June 1564, 25 June 1565, and 1 July 1568. While he was in Scotland in 1565 the queen made endeavours to have him sent to the castle of Dumbarton, but he made his escape. In January 1568 the General Assembly of the Kirk sent him through Knox a letter praying him to return to his old charge in Scotland; but although he did visit Scotland and officiated as Moderator of the Assembly, he again returned to his charge in England. According to Sir James Melville, the Earl of Morton made use of Willock to reveal to Elizabeth, through the Earls of Huntingdon and Leicester, the dealings of the Duke of Norfolk with the Regent Moray, for an arrangement by which the Duke would marry the Queen of Scots. He travelled to Scotland in May 1568, and wrote that people of the north of England, who were \\"mere ignorant of religion and altogether untaught\\" were pleased at the news that Mary, Queen of Scots had escaped from Lochleven Castle. Death and namesake Willock died in his rectory at Loughborough on 4 December 1585, and was buried the next day, being Sunday; his wife Catherine survived him fourteen years, and was buried at Loughborough on 10 Oct. 1599 (Fletcher, Parish Registers of Loughborough). Though Thomas Dempster ascribed to him , it does not appear that he left any works. George Chalmers, in his \\"Life of Ruddiman,' seeks to identify Willock with one \\"John Willokis, descended of Scottish progenitors,\\" who on 27 April 1590 is referred to in a state paper as being in prison in Leicester, after having been convicted by a jury of robbery. The supposition of Chalmers, sufficiently improbable in itself, is of course disposed of by the entry of the rector's death in the parish register, but there is just a possibility that the robber may have been the rector's son. Family Willock's wife survived until 1599. His last will makes provision for his son Edmund, and Edmund's wife Grizel, also for their children John, Katherine, Mary, Bridget, Dorothy, and George.

Regression analysis quantifies a relationship between a predictor variable and a criterion variable by the coefficient of correlation r, coefficient of determination r2, and the standard regression coefficient Œ≤. Multiple regression analysis expresses a relationship between a set of predictor variables and a single criterion variable by the multiple correlation R, multiple coefficient of determination R¬≤, and a set of standard partial regression weights Œ≤1, Œ≤2, etc. Canonical variate analysis captures a relationship between a set of predictor variables and a set of criterion variables by the canonical correlations œÅ1, œÅ2, ..., and by the sets of canonical weights C and D.  Canonical analysis  Canonical analysis belongs to a group of methods which involve solving the characteristic equation for its latent roots and vectors. It describes formal structures in hyperspace invariant with respect to the rotation of their coordinates. In this type of solution, rotation leaves many optimizing properties preserved, provided it takes place in certain ways and in a subspace of its corresponding hyperspace. This rotation from the maximum intervariate correlation structure into a different, simpler and more meaningful structure increases the interpretability of the canonical weights C and D. In this the canonical analysis differs from Harold Hotelling‚Äôs (1936) canonical variate analysis (also called the canonical correlation analysis), designed to obtain maximum (canonical) correlations between the predictor and criterion canonical variates. The difference between the canonical variate analysis and canonical analysis is analogous to the difference between the principal components analysis and factor analysis, each with its characteristic set of commonalities, eigenvalues and eigenvectors.  Canonical analysis (simple)  Canonical analysis is a multivariate technique which is concerned with determining the relationships between groups of variables in a data set. The data set is split into two groups X and Y, based on some common characteristics. The purpose of canonical analysis is then to find the relationship between X and Y, i.e. can some form of X represent Y. It works by finding the linear combination of X variables, i.e. X1, X2 etc., and linear combination of Y variables, i.e. Y1, Y2 etc., which are most highly correlated. This combination is known as the \\"first canonical variates\\" which are usually denoted U1 and V1, with the pair of U1 and V1 being called a \\"canonical function\\". The next canonical functions, U2 and V2 are then restricted so that they are uncorrelated with U1 and V1. Everything is scaled so that the variance equals 1\\\\. One can also construct relationships which are made to agree with constraint restrictions arising from theory or to agree with common sense/intuition. These are called maximum correlation models. (Tofallis, 1999) Mathematically, canonical analysis maximizes U‚Ä≤X‚Ä≤YV subject to U‚Ä≤X‚Ä≤XU = I and V‚Ä≤Y‚Ä≤YV = I, where X and Y are the data matrices (row for instance and column for feature).

Early Life William Costello was born in Montreal, Quebec in 1875 to John William Costello and Elizabeth Copps. As a child, he was known as Copps Costello, the name by which he is described in the 1891 census for Calgary, having been enumerated as Michael William Costello in the 1881 census for Renfrew Village, Ontario. In adult life, he changed his middle name to his mother's maiden name, Copps, the name by which he was generally known. Copps arrived in Calgary on the historic first train to the city in 1883. His early education was in Calgary and he became an apprentice printer. After completing his apprenticeship, he began working for the Calgary Herald. He went on to study medicine at Queen's University in Kingston in 1904. He then went to London, England for a year's post-graduate education and continued with further medical studies at the Rotunda Hospital in Dublin, Ireland. While in Ireland, he visited his father's birthplace at Trienearagh, County Kerry. He married Pearl Corrigan in Kingston in 1910. Michael's father John William Costello was a trustee of the Separate School District of the Northwest Territories, and Chairman of the Board from 1899 to 1904 which would later become the Calgary Catholic School Board. The John Costello Catholic School is named in his honour. Political Career On his return to Calgary, Costello entered municipal politics. In 1913 and 1914, he was an alderman on Calgary City Council. In the latter year, he was chosen to carry the responsibilities of acting mayor, during Mayor Sinnott's absence of three months. In the election that year, he was elected Mayor of Calgary. He spent four years as mayor from January 2, 1915 to January 2, 1919. Costello served as president of the Alberta Urban Municipalities Association in 1915-1916. Costello ran unsuccessfully for mayor in the 1922 municipal election. He ran unsuccessfully as a Conservative MLA candidate in the Calgary electoral riding in the 1921 and 1926 Alberta general elections. Later Life Following his retirement from the mayoralty, Costello became connected with the Calgary Iron Works, where he worked in an executive capacity for many years before retiring for health reasons. Costello was a founding member of the Southern Alberta Pioneer and Old Timers' Association and served as Grand Knight on the Calgary Council of the Knights of Columbus. Costello died in 1936, aged 60 and is buried in Saint Mary's Pioneer Cemetery in Calgary.

While the song is well recognized today, it was all but ignored by typical Top 40 radio during its chart life, making only the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart. Career Cashman was the lead singer for a band called The Chevrons in the late 1950s through the early 1960s. He also played Minor League Baseball in the Detroit Tigers organization at around the same time. In 1967, Cashman teamed up with Gene Pistilli and Tommy West to form the pop-folk group Cashman, Pistilli and West. Their debut album, Bound to Happen (1967), included the Cashman-Pistilli composition \\"Sunday Will Never Be the Same\\", a No. 9 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 for Spanky and Our Gang that year and No. 7 in Canada. In 1969, Cashman, Pistilli and West, under the name Buchanan Brothers, charted on the Billboard Hot 100 with \\"Medicine Man\\", No. 22, and No. 15 in Canada.All but Forgotten Oldies Retrieved May 27, 2017 The follow- up, \\"Son of a Lovin' Man\\" peaked at No. 61 on the Hot 100 and No. 50 in Canada. In November 1972, Cashman & West's song \\"American City Suite\\" hit No. 27 on the Hot 100 and No. 25 on the Canadian RPM chart. In 1973, one of the Partridge family episodes featured \\"Sunshine Eyes\\" with the music and lyrics as by Terry Cashman and T.P. West. Cashman, Pistilli and West (later reduced to Cashman & West) enjoyed modest success, recording six albums through 1975. The Cashman-West team also produced all the hit recordings of singer- songwriter Jim Croce Bronson, Fred, The Billboard Book of Number One Hits, Billboard Books, 1992 p. 338. In 1975 they launched Lifesong Records, which would have hits including \\"Shannon\\" by Henry Gross and \\"Ariel\\" by Dean Friedman. Inspired by a picture he had received of Willie Mays, Duke Snider, Joe DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle, Cashman decided to write a song dedicated to 1950s baseball. The popular choral refrain in the song \\"Talkin' Baseball\\" ‚Äî \\"Willie, Mickey, and The Duke\\" ‚Äî immediately struck a chord with fans in 1981 who were disappointed by the Major League Baseball strike that summer. Cashman has since recorded multiple versions of the song for different Major League Baseball teams. Because of this, he is now known as \\"The Balladeer of Baseball\\". He also recorded a parody of the song in 1992, \\"Talkin' Softball,\\" for the end credits The Simpsons episode \\"Homer at the Bat.\\" National honors  The Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum honored Cashman in summer 2011 as part of its induction weekend.

It was adapted by Stephen Jeffreys from his play of the same name, starring Johnny Depp, John Malkovich, Samantha Morton, and Rosamund Pike. Depp stars as John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, a notorious rake and libertine poet in the court of King Charles II of England. Samantha Morton plays Elizabeth Barry, an actress whose budding talent blossoms and makes her much in demand under Rochester's tutelage. Wilmot and Barry become lovers. John Malkovich plays King Charles II, who is torn between his affection for Wilmot and the danger posed by his displays of contempt for his sovereign. Themes explored in the film include the corruption of a people by their self- indulgent monarch and the pursuit of hedonism. The film was shot on location on the Isle of Man and Wales. Wales hosts Hollywood blockbusters The setting for Rochester's home of Adderbury house was filmed on location at Montacute House, Montacute, Somerset and Charlecote Park, Warwickshire.  Plot  John Wilmot, Second Earl of Rochester (Depp), delivers a prologue of themes of his fondness for drink, his sexual proclivities, and his disdain for his audience. King Charles II (Malkovich) retracts his banishment of the earl as he has need of him in the House of Lords. Back in London, Rochester finds his \\"Merry Gang\\" friends, George Etherege (Hollander) and Charles Sackville (Vegas), in a bawdy house. Rochester encounters on the street the thief Alcock (Coyle). Impressed by his dishonesty, Rochester hires him as his gentleman. The Merry Gang introduce to Rochester who will be its newest member, 18-year-old Billy Downs (Friend). Rochester warns Downs, \\"Young man, you will die of this company.\\" The Merry Gang attend a play where the actress Elizabeth Barry (Morton) is booed off the stage, refusing to participate in a curtain call, and is fired. Rochester is taken with Barry, secures her re-employment with the theatre company, and undertakes to coach her in acting. Barry's acting improves dramatically and she delivers a brilliant performance in her next production. The King approaches Barry to spy on Rochester as to the progress of the intended tribute to the French Ambassador. Charles, in need of money from France, asks Rochester to write a play in honour of the French Ambassador's visit. The king requests it be a \\"testament\\" to his reign. Rochester writes Sodom, or the Quintessence of Debauchery, a scathing satire of the king's reign, which he claims is \\"a testament to Charles\\" ‚Äî just what the king had asked for. The play involves vulgar language, simulated sex acts, and Rochester portraying the king being serviced. At the premiere, the king interrupts the play and on the stage confronts Rochester. Downs is mortally wounded in a sword fight outside the home of a Constable; Rochester backs away from his dying friend, whispering, \\"I told you.\\" Hiding from the king in the English countryside and sick with symptoms of syphilis, Rochester peddles phony gynaecological \\"treatments\\" for women, including the selling of \\"potions\\" made from Alcock's urine. Rochester's face has become disfigured by syphilitic gummata, which he hides beneath a mask. Charles eventually tracks down Rochester, but decides that the worst punishment possible is to simply \\"let you be you.\\" Rochester returns to his estate and wife, Elizabeth (Pike), admitting to having been constantly for five years under the influence of \\"the drink\\". Elizabeth declares her love for him. Charles' choice of heir, his Roman Catholic brother James, Duke of York, leads to a showdown with Parliament with the Exclusion Bill that would deny James the throne. Rochester uses make-up and a silver nose tip to hide the indications of syphilis as he enters the House of Lords hobbling on two canes. His denunciation in the Lords of the bill ingratiates the appreciation of the king when it is defeated. When Rochester reveals his desire to have wanted Barry as his wife she reveals she never had the desire to be the wife of anyone, she had a daughter by him that he was unaware of, and this daughter is called Elizabeth. Rochester returns to his estate where he is bedridden in the care of Elizabeth, his mother, a priest summoned to \\"bring God to him\\" as she did not want Rochester to die as an atheist, and Alcock. Before he dies, Rochester asks the priest to recite from Book of Isaiah, chapter 53; he also asks his wife to retell the story of how he had abducted her when she was 18 years old and they fell in love. Rochester's death is followed by a scene of Elizabeth Barry playing the role of his wife in The Man of Mode, the play about him written by his friend Etheridge. The epilogue is Rochester slipping into the darkness of an increasingly fading candlelight, asking \\"Do you like me now?\\"  Cast   Music  The score to the film was composed by Michael Nyman, and released as The Libertine: Music for the Film by Laurence Dunmore in November 2005.

No self- respecting libertine lives that long. Johnny Depp finds sadness in the earl's descent, and a desire to be loved even as he makes himself unlovable. What a brave actor Depp is, to take on a role like this. Still, at the screenplay stage, 'The Libertine' might have seemed a safer bet than Pirates of the Caribbean, a movie [which] studio executives reportedly thought was unreleasable.\\" = Box office = The film has grossed $4,835,065 in North America and $6,016,999 in other territories, for a total of $10,852,064 worldwide. = Awards and honours = The Libertine was nominated in eight categories in the British Independent Film Awards for 2005, and won in one category, gaining a Best Performance by a Supporting Actor or Actress in a British Independent Film award for Rosamund Pike.

It is a prominent feature in the Patterdale skyline, with a distinctive rounded shape. Indeed, it figures so finely in views from the upper reach of the lake that it is sometimes referred to as ‚Äòthe Ullswater Fell‚Äô.Richards, Mark: Near Eastern Fells: Collins (2003): Topography St Sunday Crag is the high point on the north-eastern ridge of Fairfield, which runs for two miles before descending to the valley floor behind Patterdale village. From the flat Fairfield summit a rough slope descends over the subsidiary top of Cofa Pike to the col at Deepdale Hause at c680 m (2,200 ft). This is a narrow point on the ridge, deeply scarred by pedestrian traffic. The ground now rises again to St Sunday Crag, soaring above the dales on either side. Beyond the summit there is a swift drop to the lower plateau of Birks and beyond this is the further satellite of Arnison Crag. The top of St Sunday Crag is triangular in plan with a third ridge running off due east. This crosses a depression (The Cape) before the lower top of Gavel Pike at 784 m (2,572 ft) is reached. From below this is a shapely pyramid worthy of the ‚Äòpike‚Äô designation, although its subsidiarity is all too plain from above. Below Gavel Pike is the further top of Lord's Seat before the short east ridge falls away over rough ground to Deepdale. It is the north-western face above Grisedale that is St Sunday Crag's chief glory. The long graceful curve of the top is set above a wall of crag half a mile long, the whole face being neatly symmetrical. A series of vertical gullies slice through the crags, which together with the intervening ridges provide sport for scramblers and climbers. The crags peter out at about 550 m (1,800 ft), to be replaced by a steep scree slope falling to the valley floor, a further 250 m (800 ft) below. Fine views of this face can be had from Helvellyn and Birkhouse Moor across the valley. To the south-east of the fell is the valley of Deepdale, separating St Sunday Crag from Hart Crag and Hartsop above How. This face too is steep and rough, although without sustained outcropping of rock. Between Gavel Pike and Birks is Cold Cove, a hanging valley cut off by Deepdale. All of the becks from St Sunday Crag reach the head of Ullswater at Patterdale. Geology Geologically the summit area is andesite, overlaying the St Sunday Crag Member, a 50-metre-thick layer of rhyodactic lapilli-tuff which breaks the surface on the east ridge.Woodhall, DG: Geology of the Keswick District- a brief explanation of the geological map. 1:50,000 Sheet 29: British Geological Survey (2000) Summit Given the fine ridges to either side, the summit of St Sunday Crag is surprisingly level and green. Two cairns sit upon the highest area, where rocks protrude through the turf. A further cairn at the northern end of the summit area marks the prime viewpoint for Ullswater. A quartz cross, now hard to find amid the bilberry, lies above the crags marking the top of East Chockstone Gully. The view takes much of the District, Striding Edge and the crags of Fairfield being particularly prominent.Alfred Wainwright: A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Book 1: Gavel Pike provides good views of the head of Deepdale. Ascents The main starting point for ascents is Patterdale, either by climbing or traversing Birks. Arnison Crag can also be thrown in for good measure and the north-east ridge gives fantastic rearward views of Ullswater. A further Patterdale alternative is the Elmhow zig-zag which climbs the Grisedale face just north of the crags. Lord's Seat and the east ridge can be climbed from Deepdale, starting from the car park at Bridgend. St Sunday Crag can also be ascended from the west by making first for Grisedale Tarn. This puts the summit into reach from Grasmere or Dunmail Raise. St Sunday Crag now finds itself on Alfred Wainwright's popular Coast to Coast Walk, vastly increasing the traffic across the top. Name Saint Sunday is a local name for Saint Dominic, though it is not certain how this saint‚Äôs name became attached to the fell.

William the Breton was, as his name indicates, born in Brittany, probably in the town of Saint-Pol-de-L√©on. He was educated at Mantes and at the University of Paris. William gained the status of \\"Master\\" and was recorded by his contemporary Giles of Paris as one of the fifteen sages of Paris of his day. Later, he became chaplain to the French king Philip Augustus, who employed him on diplomatic errands, and entrusted him with the education of his natural son, Pierre Charlot. William is supposed to have been present at the Battle of Bouvines. His works are the Philippide and the Gesta Philippi H. regis Francorum. The former, a classicizing Latin epic poem in 12 books and composed in three redactions, gives some very interesting details about Philip Augustus and his time, including some information about military matters, and shows that William was an excellent Latin scholar. In its final form the Gesta is an epitome of the work of Rigord, who wrote a life of Philip Augustus from 1179 to 1206, and an original continuation by William himself from 1207 to 1220. In both works William speaks in very laudatory terms of the king; but his writings are valuable because he had personal knowledge of many of the facts which he relates. He also wrote a poem Karlotis, dedicated to Charlot, which is lost. William's works were edited with an introduction by Henri Delaborde as ≈íuvres de Rigord et de Guillaume le Breton (Paris, 1882‚Äì1885), and were translated into French by Fran√ßois Guizot in Collection des m√©moires relatifs a l'histoire de France, tomes xi and xii (Paris, 1823‚Äì1835). See Delaborde's introduction, and Auguste Molinier, Les Sources de l'histoire de France, tome iii (Paris, 1903). Book I of the Philippide, along with relevant selections of the Gesta, was translated into English by Gregory P. Stringer.

The Motu are native inhabitants of Papua New Guinea, living along the southern coastal area of the country. Their indigenous language is also known as Motu, and like several other languages of the region is an Austronesian language. They and the Koitabu people are the original inhabitants and owners of the land on which Port Moresby -- the national capital city ‚Äî stands. The largest Motu village is Hanuabada, northwest of Port Moresby.  History  Friedrich Ratzel in The History of Mankind reported in 1896 on tattooing in Melanesia. Among the relatively light-skinned Motu he found tattooing in patterns similar to those of Micronesia. He also reported, among the old women, blackening the body with a kind of earth which gives a lustre like black lead. This was said to be a sign of mourning. Charles Gabriel Seligman came into contact with the Motu, in 1904. He noted that, unlike many of their neighbors in the region, the Motu did not practice exogamy. Every year, they practiced the hiri, when community members made trading voyages through the Gulf of Papua. Women made pottery for sale through the hiri.  Culture  Despite increased westernization, the Motu still engage in some traditional practices. These include the value of traditional music and dance, observing the bridewealth and still retaining most of the land rights in the Port Moresby region.

The station is owned by Salem Media Group. KDIZ's studios are located in Eagan, while its transmitter is located in St. Louis Park. 1570 AM is a Mexican clear-channel frequency. History =KUXL= The station signed on the air on October 27, 1961Broadcasting Yearbook 1964, page B-84 as KUXL and has a long history of being a religion-oriented radio station. In the 1960s and 1970s, KUXL played gospel and R&B; music, prior to becoming full-time religious. During this period and for many years after, the station was restricted to daytime operation. Its studios and offices were originally located at 4820 Olson Highway in Golden ValleySecret Stash Records, page 27 and later on Duluth Street. The transmitter and antenna were first co-located with KQRS (AM) on Highway 100 and later on the station's own tower a block away from the Duluth Street studios, next to Highway 100. In the mid-1960s, the station was operated by Marvin Kosofsky. Kosofsky hired Bob Smith (a.k.a. Wolfman Jack), who relocated from Del Rio, Texas, to run the station with a mostly R&B; format. Also at KUXL at this time were Art Hoehn (a.k.a. Fat Daddy Washington) and former KDWB personality Ralph Hull (a.k.a. Preacher Paul Anthony and The Nazz). It was this trio of broadcasters who took control of \\"border blaster\\" station XERB 1090, in Baja California, in 1965. They operated the \\"Big X\\" from Minneapolis initially, then relocated to Southern California in 1966. KUXL sponsored numerous concerts by such artists as Ike and Tina Turner, the Four Tops, BB King, Solomon Burke, the Temptations, Jimmy Reed, Jr. Walker, the Impressions and Fats Domino. KUXL was a ratings success in the early 1970s. Some of the on-the-air talent from that era included Maury Bernstein, a noted musicologist/folklorist who later hosted for National Public Radio. Bernstein was the major authority on Scandinavian music in the U.S. Bob Allard was famed Twin Cities talk show host and television (KMSP) newscaster. Allard was one of the best-known voices in Twin Cities broadcasting history. Allard was known for portraying the character \\"Cactus Jim\\" on both radio and television in Iowa in the 1950s. Chris Robbins, also known as John Ryan, also worked for WTCN-TV. Brian Tolzmann was the youngest major market news director in the country at the time. He later hosted a nationally syndicated radio show, and worked with former KUXL manager Wolfman Jack on several national concert shows. Steve Blitz and talk show hosts Joe Barbeau and Jim King were also part of the staff. =KYCR= The call letters changed to KYCR in May 1988. KYCR was in 1994 purchased by Children's Broadcasting Corporation, parent of the Radio Aahs children's format, becoming a sister to Aahs flagship station WWTC (1280 AM). KYCR retained its religious format as studios were co-located with WWTC at Excelsior Boulevard and Highway 100 in St. Louis Park. In 1995, the transmitter was moved a few miles south of its longtime tower to WWTC's 4-tower transmission facility in St. Louis Park, west of Highway 100 and south of I-394. KYCR was acquired by religious and conservative broadcast company Salem Communications in 1998. Two years later, they bought WWTC, and both stations moved to the facility of Salem's KKMS in Eagan (transmission continued from the WWTC/KYCR site in St. Louis Park). From 2002 until 2007, KYCR was a time-shifted version of WWTC \\"The Patriot\\" as \\"The Patriot II\\". The format was then changed to a general talk format with its own identity, simply known as \\"AM 1570: The New Talk of the Twin Cities\\". In April 2007, KYCR lost syndicated talk-show host Don Imus from the lineup after the network cancelled the show. After two months of a \\"Dr. Laura\\" replay in the slot, the show was replaced by The War Room with Quinn and Rose from WPGB in Pittsburgh, becoming the first affiliate for the show in the midwest. Until April 2009, other programming included Dennis Miller, The Radio Factor, Laura Schlessinger, Lars Larson, Janet Parshall, and Mark Levin. On August 13, 2008, North Dakota State University announced that KYCR would become the home of NDSU Bison football broadcasts for the 2008 season. This makes the station the first affiliate in the Twin Cities area for NDSU sports. The station attempted yet another format change on March 30, 2009, this time to an all-business format, carrying programming from the Bloomberg News business network. The station's slogan changed to \\"Business 1570 -- Twin Cities Business Radio.\\" =KDIZ= On December 15, 2015, KYCR began stunting with a loop directing listeners to KDIZ 1440 AM, with KYCR's business news format moving to that station. On December 24, Salem changed the call letters of 1570 AM to KDIZ.http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi- bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/call_hist.pl?Facility_id=10828&Callsign;=KDIZ On January 11, 2016, the station relaunched as \\"Wellness Radio\\", a first-of- its-kind Health & Wellness talk format.Wellness Radio Debuting In Minneapolis - Radio Insight (published January 6, 2016) =Freedom 1570= On November 30, 2019, KDIZ began stunting with a loop of morse code, unusual noises, radio crackle, and voice messages, and advising listeners to tune in on the morning of December 2 for an announcement.

He served as a state representative in Mississippi and then was elected in 1838 as US representative from the state in the Twenty-fifth United States Congress, serving one term from 1838 to 1839. Prentiss was noted as one of the most remarkable orators of his day. Daniel Webster, known himself as a great orator, said that he had never heard a speaker as powerful as Prentiss.  Early life  Prentiss was born September 30, 1808, in Portland in Massachusetts' District of Maine. He was the son of Captain William Prentiss, a prosperous shipmaster, and his wife. Seargent contracted a virulent fever as an infant, which caused the loss of the use of his limbs for several years. His right leg never fully recovered. During the War of 1812, the economic embargo against the United Kingdom brought his father to the verge of ruin. The family relocated to Gorham, Maine, near Seargent's maternal grandfather Major George Lewis and his wife. Prentiss attended Gorham Academy and Bowdoin College in Brunswick. He graduated from Bowdoin at age 17 and began the study of law in the office of Josiah Pierce in Gorham.  Career  After graduating from Bowdoin College in 1826, he went to Natchez, Mississippi as a teacher. He continued to study law and was admitted to the bar in 1829. In 1832, he moved to Vicksburg, Mississippi and won a suit involving title to the most valuable part of the city. The property which he obtained as his fee made him one of the wealthiest men of Mississippi. He was elected to the State Legislature in 1835 as a Whig. In July 1837, Democrats John F. H. Claiborne and Samuel J. Gholson were re-elected to the United States House of Representatives in a special election. In November 1837, Mississippi held the regular election. Prentiss launched a vigorous, partisan campaign. He and fellow Whig Thomas J. Word won in an upset. Claiborne and Gholson then argued that the July result entitled them to serve full terms. The House agreed to hear Prentiss. He spoke for nine hours over three days, packing the gallery, drawing Senators, and earning a national reputation for oratory and public admiration from leading Whigs including Senators Clay and Webster. The Elections Committee then required a third election. Held in April 1838, it confirmed the November result. Both Whigs were seated in May late in the second session, also serving for the third session. He was publicly embarrassed by his mounting financial troubles. He had made property investments based on disputed land holdings. He served only one term in Congress. Prentiss later went on the lecture circuit. He reportedly rarely gave speeches from prepared notes and, instead, would ad- lib for hours to large crowds that often begged him for more. After Mississippi repudiated her state bonds, Prentiss, who had opposed this action, moved to New Orleans in 1845. He became a leader of the city's bar, and prominent in philanthropic work. His death at the age of 41 in 1850 shocked the nation. Prentiss had been considered among the most gifted young men in the nation. He is buried at Gloucester Plantation Cemetery in Natchez.  Honors and Awards  Prentiss County, Mississippi was named for Seargent Prentiss when it was formed on April 15, 1870. Prentiss, Mississippi was founded in 1903, and became the county seat of Jefferson Davis County, Mississippi in 1906.

BY-2 (cultivar Bright Yellow - 2 of the tobacco plant). Overview Tobacco BY-2 cells are nongreen, fast growing plant cells which can multiply their numbers up to 100-fold within one week in adequate culture medium and good culture conditions. This cultivar of tobacco is kept as a cell culture and more specifically as cell suspension culture (a specialized population of cells growing in liquid medium, they are raised by scientists in order to study a specific biological property of a plant cell). In cell suspension cultures, each of the cells is floating independently or at most only in short chains in a culture medium. Each of the cells has similar properties to the others. The model plant system is comparable to HeLa cells for human research. Because the organism is relatively simple and predictable it makes the study of biological processes easier, and can be an intermediate step towards understanding more complex organisms. They are used by plant physiologists and molecular biologists as a model organism. They are used as model systems for higher plants because of their relatively high homogeneity and high growth rate, featuring still general behaviour of plant cell. The diversity of cell types within any part of a naturally grown plant (in vivo) makes it very difficult to investigate and understand some general biochemical phenomena of living plant cells. The transport of a solute in or out of the cell, for example, is difficult to study because the specialized cells in a multicellular organism behave differently. Cell suspension cultures such as tobacco BY-2 provide good model systems for these studies at the level of a single cell and its compartments because tobacco BY-2 cells behave very similarly to one another. The influence of neighbouring cells behavior is in the suspension is not as important as it would be in an intact plant. As a result any changes observed after a stimulus is applied can be statistically correlated and it could be decided if these changes are reactions to the stimulus or just merely coincidental. In this moment BY-2 cells are relatively well understood and often used in research. This model plant system is especially useful for studies of cell division, cytoskeletons, plant hormone signaling, intracellular trafficking, and organelle differentiation.

He rose to prominence with the success of his single \\"Wavin' Flag\\", which was chosen as Coca-Cola's promotional anthem for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Besides hip hop, K'naan's sound is influenced by elements of Somali music and world music. He is also involved in various philanthropic initiatives. Personal life K'naan was born 16 Aprilhttps://twitter.com/KNAAN/status/959239088112095234 1978 in Mogadishu, situated in the southeastern Banaadir province of Somalia to a Habar Gidir Hawiye family. K'naan's family was from an artistic background. His grandfather was a famous poet, and his aunt Magool was a renowned singer. His name, Keynaan (), means \\"traveller\\" in the Somali language. K'naan spent his childhood in Mogadishu. His father, Abdi, had left earlier when he was still a boy to work as a taxi driver in New York City. K'naan's early years were idyllic and enveloped in poetry and song, with his aunt Magool often singing to him. This changed following the start of the civil war, when at the age of 12, three of his friends were shot by an older adolescent gunman. K'naan also narrowly escaped death one day at his school, when he mistook a grenade that he had found in the dirt for a potato and threw it away just before it detonated. These incidents and the general escalation in violence prompted his mother to seek a visa so that the family could join his father in New York. When he was 13, K'naan and his mother and two siblings, older brother Liban and younger sister Sagal, moved to the United States. They stayed in New York for half a year where K'naan's father had settled, before relocating to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, his family still resides there. K'naan himself recently went back to New York City where his dad usually lives. In his new environment, K'naan began learning English, partly by listening to hip hop albums by artists like Nas and Rakim. Despite the fact that he could not yet speak the language, he taught himself hip-hop and rap diction, copying the lyrics and style phonetically. He then also began rapping. While growing up in Toronto's Rexdale neighbourhood, K'naan lost many friends to murder, suicide, prison and deportation. K'naan was married to Deqa, a pharmacy technician, with whom he has two sons, born in 2005 and 2007. The couple divorced before K'naan started touring for the 2010 FIFA World Cup with Coca-Cola. Career K'naan became a friend and associate of Canadian promoter Sol Guy, who helped him secure a speaking engagement before the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in 1999, where K'naan performed a spoken word piece criticizing the UN for its failed peacekeeping missions to Somalia. One of the audience members, Senegalese singer Youssou N'Dour, was so impressed by the young MC's performance and courage that he invited him to contribute to his 2001 album Building Bridges, a project through which K'naan was able to tour the world. This project led to his work at other UN events, as well as the Montreal Jazz Festival and the Halifax Pop Explosion. It also helped him meet Canadian producer Brian West and Jarvis Church and his Track & Field team in 2002, who produced his debut album The Dusty Foot Philosopher, which was released in 2005 to critical acclaim. In 2006, it won the Juno Award for Rap Recording of the Year, and was nominated for the 2006 Polaris Music Prize. It also won the BBC Radio 3 Award for World Music in the newcomer category for 2007. The Dusty Foot Philosopher was re-released and repackaged as a \\"Deluxe Edition\\" featuring new mixes and a bonus DVD in the United States (and various international territories) by the emerging media company and record label iM (Interdependent Media, Inc.) in 2008. K'naan toured and collaborated with artists like Nelly Furtado, Mos Def, will.i.am, The Roots, Dead Prez, and Pharoahe Monch on tours such as Live 8 and Breedlove Odyssey. He also collaborated with Damian Marley on the \\"Welcome to Jamrock\\" touring session. K'naan released The Dusty Foot on the Road, a collection of recordings made during his world tour on Wrasse Records. K'naan rose to mainstream popularity by participating in the 2008 BET Awards Cypher. This was his first appearance on American television. His second studio album, Troubadour, was released on 24 February 2009 on A&M;/Octone Records, and distributed through Universal Music Group worldwide. The album's first single, \\"ABC's\\", was released in late 2008. K'naan's music has featured in several video games such as Madden NFL 09 (with his song \\"ABC's\\") and FIFA 06 (with his song \\"Soobax\\"). The song \\"If Rap Gets Jealous\\", a re-recording of a track of the same name ‚Äì with different verses ‚Äì from The Dusty Foot Philosopher, features Metallica lead guitarist Kirk Hammett. K'naan was also the first featured artist on X3, a collaborative project between CBC Radio 3, Exclaim! magazine and aux.tv to promote new Canadian music. In July 2010, he performed a cover of U2's \\"Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of\\" for iheartradio. On 24 January 2012, K'naan released a 5-song EP under the title More Beautiful Than Silence including songs such as \\"Nothing to Lose\\", \\"Better\\", \\"Is Anybody Out There?\\". The songs also include collaborations with Nas and Nelly Furtado. K'naan's 2012 album, Country, God or the Girl, was met with little of the critical acclaim and success that Troubadour had received. Unlike Troubadour, which was produced almost entirely by production team Track and Field, Country, God or the Girl featured a wide range of different producers, many of whom work on more mainstream projects. After the release of the album, K'naan published an article in the New York Times explaining and apologizing for the change in his sound. \\"My lyrics should change, my label's executives said; radio programmers avoid subjects too far from fun and self-absorption,\\" recounts K'naan. \\"So I began to say yes. Yes to trying out songs with A-list producers. Yes to moving production from Kingston to Los Angeles.\\" In the end, K'naan states \\"I had not made my Marley or my Dylan, or even my K'naan; I had made an album in which a few genuine songs are all but drowned out by the loud siren of ambition. Fatima had become Mary, and Mohamed, Adam.\\" In 2012, K'naan published a children's book, When I Get Older: The Story Behind Wavin' Flag.Greg Quill, \\"The story behind K‚Äônaan‚Äôs ‚ÄúWavin‚Äô Flag‚Äù\\". Toronto Star, 27 September 2012. He is featured along with Howard Shore in the Cosmopolis (2012) soundtrack. Political involvement K‚ÄôNaan has remained committed to his Somali roots and continues to be outspoken in the geopolitics of his home country. He is often regarded as a spokesperson for the Toronto Somali community. In 2007 he was invited by Canadian Broadcast Corporation to reflect on changes Somali courts- including the removal of the Islamic Courts Union.Article by the CBC K‚ÄôNaan renounced this act by Somalia and indicated his support for the Islamic Courts Union- pushing back on the Western nations critiques of Muslim governing systems. Furthermore, he has spoken out against the clan system used in Somalia and particularly its use in immigrant communities in Canada.Robin, Denselow, \\"A Brave man Doesn't Need Weapons, The Guardian, 05/25/2007 K‚ÄôNaan's engagement with his Somali roots dates back to his first hit ‚ÄúSoobax,‚Äù which in his native Somali language means come out. The song critiques the warlords that held power in Somalia's capital, Mogadishu. The song gained popularity in both Somalia and Canada, in addition to the general population in North America. Additionally, K‚ÄôNaan goes beyond reflecting on his Somali roots in his lyrics as he often raps in both English and Somali rather than one language. His choice to blend both languages has made him a stand out in hip hop, as most rappers often rap in English. K‚ÄôNaan's involvement in the rap and hip hop in Northern America has expanded the discussion on both Somali and the Black Diaspora in the West. Both his music and appearances on television and radio shows have grown the conversation on what it means to be Black in Canada. In addition to Black communities that have been residing in the country for over a century there are large Black immigrant communities from the Caribbean and Africa. Rather than speaking for a larger Black diaspora, K‚ÄôNaan speaks on his own personal experience and thus expanding on experiences of Somali's in Canada.[Campbell, Mark. \\"Other/ed\\" Kinds of Blackness: An Afrodiasporic Versioning of Black Canada. Southern Journal of Canadian Studies. 2012] K‚ÄôNaan continues to be a voice of the Toronto Somali communities. Additionally, he has expanded the greater discussion of Afrodiasporic communities in Canada and the West. K‚Äônaan's cover of the Bob Dylan song \\"With God on Our Side\\" is the closing song on Michael Moore's movie Fahrenheit 11/9. Style and influences Jim Welte has said K'naan has \\"a sound that fuses Bob Marley, conscious American hip-hop, and brilliant protest poetry.\\" His voice and style has been compared to Eminem, but his subject matter is very different; according to K'naan, he makes \\"urgent music with a message\\", talking about the situation in his homeland of Somalia and calling for an end to violence and bloodshed. He specifically tries to avoid gangsta rap clich√©s and posturing, saying: This statement was made to explain his position on the world of difference which exists between where he grew up, and the ghettos of the first world. Nonetheless, K'naan denies that he is overtly political, instead explaining that he \\"[shows] the state of the world [and] if you call it like it is you're being political.\\" His own opinion of his music is that it's a \\"mix of tradition and [a] kind of articulation of my own life and [..] my past experiences.\\" K'naan has said that he is influenced by Somali music and the traditional instruments of Somalia. His 2009 album, Troubadour, also draws heavily from Ethiopian sources, particularly Ethio-Jazz by Alemayehu Eshete and Tilahun Gessesse. K'naan's single \\"Fatima\\" is about his childhood friend who got killed in the Somali civil war. Notable live performances Prior to the release of Troubadour, K'naan performed with a small acoustic band, consisting of Rayzak (back-up vocals), Kierscey Rand (acoustic guitar) and UDOGG-The Funky Drummer (djembe and drums). This style was an essential element of what set K'naan apart from most hip-hop acts. More than that, it reflected K'naan's value of meaningful lyrics over shallow theatrics. One of the last performances of this band was on 16 March 2009 when K'naan rendered four songs from the newly launched album for CBC's program Q with Jian Ghomeshi, although Rayzak continued to join his subsequent shows and Kierscey Rand made occasional appearances, such as his World Cup Trophy Tour. Since Troubadour, K'naan has toured almost exclusively with a larger electric ensemble ‚Äì consisting of drums, bass, electric guitar, and keyboards ‚Äì and his performances now also feature elaborate lighting. This change in showmanship, along with his collaborations with such high-profile artists as Adam Levine and Mos Def, has helped to shift K'naan more into the mainstream flow of the music industry and has helped him gain exposure to a wider audience. =2010 FIFA World Cup tour= A remixed version of K'naan's single, \\"Wavin' Flag,\\" was chosen as Coca-Cola's anthem for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. It was also used in the commercials for the pre-game, which was held in South Africa. Additionally, the track is in the soundtrack for the official EA Sports 2010 FIFA World Cup video game. In December 2009, K'naan performed the song live during the sponsor's FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour, which took him to 86 countries around the world. His performance of \\"Wavin' Flag\\" was featured in the Top 10 hits in 11 different countries across the world. This also included number one hits in Mexico, Austria, China, Germany, Luxembourg and Switzerland. In order to appeal to different people around the world, K'naan also recorded the song with various local artists such as David Bisbal, Jacky Cheung, Jane Zhang, Nancy Ajram and Tattoo Colour. =No Show at Simon Fraser University = On 21 September 2010, K'naan was scheduled as the headlining act of a student organised concert for World Peace Day which was to benefit girls' education in rural Ghana. At 11pm the singer cancelled, for reasons that have been reported as relating to finances. His manager stated that, \\"this is the first time in K'naan's seven-year career that he has pulled out of a performance for such a reason\\"., archived at the Internet Wayback Machine K'naan announced on his Twitter following the concert \\"amazing how human beings need a bogeyman. It's even better when they can turn their heroes to foes. SFU, check your own back yard for faults.\\" =Coke's 125th Anniversary= On 8 May 2011, K'naan performed live at Atlanta's Centennial Olympic Park for Coca-Cola's employees in light of Coke's 125th anniversary. =\\"Decade of Difference\\" Clinton Concert= On 15 October 2011 at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, K'naan was one of eight performers at the \\"Decade of Difference\\" concert. The concert celebrated former US President Bill Clinton's 65th birthday and the 10-year anniversary of the Clinton Foundation. K'naan was the third performer of the evening, following sets by Stevie Wonder and Kenny Chesney and preceding sets by Juanes, Usher, Lady Gaga, and The Edge and Bono of U2. K'naan performed three songs ‚Äì \\"Bulletproof Pride,\\" \\"America,\\" and \\"Wavin' Flag.\\" Toward the end of \\"Bulletproof Pride,\\" K'naan surprised the audience by bringing Bono onstage for a duet. K'naan also spoke about his childhood in Somalia and how President Clinton's efforts overseas positively impacted his youth. Musical feud In 2005, the Canadian music scene featured a low-key feud between K'naan and k-os, one of the most prominent Canadian hip-hop artists. Following the release of the music video for the song \\"Soobax\\", which was shot by K'naan and a film crew in Kenya, k-os released a track \\"B-Boy Stance\\" attacking K'naan: \\"They took cameras to Africa for pictures to rhyme / Over; Oh, yes, the great pretenders [...] Religious entertainers who want to be life savers.\\" Though the feud never became high- profile, with K'naan expressing confusion at the attack and respect for k-os, he nonetheless responded with the mixtape track \\"Revolutionary Avocado\\" which argued \\"You the all-knowing with a beer bottle / Wishing you was Plato and me Aristotle? / ...Suburban negro turned hip-hop hero / Is there a reason he really hates me, though?\\" ‚Äì a rebuttal CBC's Matthew McKinnon called \\"cold- cocking the champ\\".

Thatta was the medieval capital of Sindh, and served as the seat of power for three successive dynasties. Thatta's historic significance has yielded several monuments in and around the city. Thatta's Makli Necropolis, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is site of one of the world's largest cemeteries and has numerous monumental tombs built between the 14th and 18th centuries designed in a syncretic funerary style characteristic of lower Sindh. The city's 17th century Shah Jahan Mosque is richly embellished with decorative tiles, and is considered to have the most elaborate display of tile work in the South Asia. Etymology Thatta's Sindhi name Thatto may derive from the Sindhi words 'Tatti', or 'Tatto', which all refer to riverside settlements. Villagers in the rural areas of lower Sindh often refer to the city as Thatta Nagar, or simply Nagar. History =Early= Thatta may be the site of ancient Patala, the main port on the Indus in the time of Alexander the Great,James Rennell, Memoir of a map of Hindoostan:or the Mogul's Empire, London, 1783, p.57; William Vincent, The Voyage of Nearchus from the Indus to the Euphrates, London, 1797, p.146; William Robertson, An Historical Disquisition concerning the Knowledge which the Ancients had of India, A. Strahan, T. Cadell Jun. and W. Davies; and E. Balfour, Edinburgh, 1799, p.47; Alexander Burnes, Travels into Bokhara: containing the narrative of a voyage on the Indus [...] and an account of a journey from India to Cabool, Tartary, and Persia, London, John Murray, 1835, Volume 1, p.27; Carl Ritter, Die Erdkunde im Verh√§ltniss zur Natur und zur Geschichte des Menschen, Berlin, Reimer, 1835, Band IV, F√ºnfter Theil, pp.475‚Äì476. though the site of Patala has been subject to much debate.A.H. Dani and P. Bernard, \\"Alexander and His Successors in Central Asia\\", in J√°nos Harmatta, B.N. Puri and G.F. Etemadi (editors), History of civilizations of Central Asia, Paris, UNESCO, Vol.II, 1994, p.85. Muhammad bin Qasim captured the region in 711 CE after the defeating the local Raja in a battle north of Thatta. Thatta is reported by some historians to have been the ancient seaport of Debal that was mentioned by the Arab conquerors, though others place the seaport at the site of modern Karachi. At the time of the Umayyad conquests, small semi-nomadic tribes were living in the Sindh region. The Umayyad conquest introduced the religion of Islam into the hitherto mostly Hindu and Buddhist region. =Medieval= Thatta's Makli Necropolis features several monumental tombs dating from the 14th to 18th centuries. Following Mahmud of Ghazna's invasion of Sindh in the early 11th century, the Ghaznavids installed Abdul Razzaq as Governor of Thatta in 1026. Under the rule of the Ghaznavids the local chieftain Ibn Sumar, then ruler of Multan, seized power in Sindh and founded the Sumra dynasty, which ruled from Thatta from 1051 for the next 300 years. Under Sumra rule, Thatta's Ismaili Shia population was granted special protection. The Sumra dynasty began to decline in power by the 13th century, though Thatta and the Indus Delta remained their last bastions of power until the mid 14th century. In 1351, the Samma Dynasty, of Rajput descent from Sehwan, seized the city and made it their capital as well. It was during this time that the Makli Necropolis rose to prominence as a funerary site. Muhammad bin Tughluq died in 1351 during a campaign to capture Thatta. Firuz Shah Tughlaq unsuccessfully attempted to subjugate Thatta twice; once in 1361 and again in 1365. = Portuguese = In 1520, the Samma ruler Jam Feroz was defeated by Shah Beg of the Arghun-Tarkhun dynasty, which in turn had been displaced from Afghanistan by the expanding Timurid Empire in Central Asia. The Tarkhuns fell into disarray in the mid 1500s, prompting Muhammad Isa Tarkhun (Mirza Isa Khan I) to seek aid from the Portuguese in 1555. 700 Portuguese soldiers arrived in 28 ships to determine, at the time of their arrival, that Isa Tarkhun had already emerged victorious from the conflict. After the Tarkhuns refused to pay the Portuguese soldiers, the Portuguese plundered the town, robbing its enormous gold treasury, and killing many inhabitants. Despite the 1555 sack of Thatta, the 16th century Portuguese historian Diogo do Couto described Thatta as one of the richest cities of the Orient. Nevertheless, some Portuguese presence was early in the 16th century with the conquest of Hormuz by Afonso de Albuquerque in 1507, which started the relationship with Sindi. Later in the first decade of the 16th century, traders created a factory (), and in the end of the 16th century a religious Order (Carmelitas Descal√ßos) founded a convent. =Mughal= Thatta's Shah Jahan Mosque features extensive tile work that displays Timurid influences introduced from Central Asia. The city was destroyed by Mirza Jani Beg in the 16th century.Ali, Mubarak 1994. McMurdo's & Delhoste's account of Sindh Takhleeqat, Lahore, p. 28-29. Beginning in 1592 during the reign of Emperor Jehangir, Thatta was governed by the Mughal Empire based in Delhi, which lead to a decline in the city's prosperity as some trade was shifted towards other Mughal ports. Shah Jahan, while still a prince, sought refuge in the city from his father Emperor Jahangir. In 1626, Shah Jahan's 13th son, Lutfallah, was born in Thatta. The city was almost destroyed by a devastating storm in 1637. As a token of gratitude for the hospitality he had received in the city while still a prince, Shah Jahan bestowed the Shah Jahan Mosque to the city in 1647as part of the city's rebuilding efforts, although it was not completed until 1659 under the reign of his son Aurangzeb. Emperor Aurangzeb himself had also lived in Thatta for some time as governor of the lower Sindh. Thatta regained some of its prosperity with the arrival of European merchants. Between 1652 and 1660, the Dutch East India Company had a small tradingpost (comptoir or factory) in Thatta.Floor, Willem, 1993-4. The Dutch East India Company (VOC) and Diewel-Sind (Pakistan) in the 17th and 18th centuries. Institute of Central & West Asian Studies, University of Karachi. This competed with the English one, which was established in 1635 and closed in 1662. Thatta in the 1650s was noted to have 2,000 looms that produced cloth that was exported abroad to Asia and Portugal. Thatta was also home to a thriving silk weaving industry, as well as leather products that were exported throughout South Asia. The city was considered by visiting Augustinian friars in the 1650s to be a wealthy city, though the presence of transgender hijras were taken as a sign of the city's supposed moral depravity. Thatta'a revival was short lived as the Indus River silted in the second half of the 1600s, shifting its course further east and leading to the abandonment of the city as a seaport. Despite the abandonment of the city's port functions, its Hindu merchants continued to play an important role in trade, and began using their own ships rather than relying on European ships for trade. Traders were particularly active in the region around Masqat, in modern Oman, and members of Thatta's Bhatia caste established Masqat's first Hindu temple during this period. Sindh remained an important economic centre during this period as well, and Thatta remained Sindh's largest economic centre, and its largest centre for textile production. =Mir Bejar= The Mir Bejar dynasty began to gain influence as a dynasty of feudal lords in lower Sindh, they were of Sisodia clan of Mewar, where they ruled since the middle 17th century. They were merchant rulers who flourished in Sindh during the Mughal period and eventually brought Thatta under their control in 1638, after which they became hereditary rulers of Thatta, before eventually moving to nearby Cutch State in 1750. =Kalhora= The Kalhora dynasty began to gain influence as a dynasty of feudal lords in upper Sindh, where they ruled since the middle 16th century. They eventually brought Thatta under their control in 1736, after which they moved their capital to Thatta before eventually moving it to Hyderabad in 1789. A British factory was established there in 1758, but only lasted a few years. Thatta continued to decline in the mid 18th century in importance as a trading centre throughout the 18th century, as much of the city's trading classes shifted to Shikarpur in northern Sindh, or to Gujarat. =Talpur= In 1739, however, following the Battle of Karnal, the Mughal province of Sindh was fully ceded to Nadir Shah of the Persian Empire, after which Thatta fell into neglect, as the Indus river also began to silt. The city then came under the rule of the Talpur dynasty, who seized Thatta from the Kalhoras. A second British comptoir was established during the Kalhora period in 1758, which operated until 1775.Ali, Mubarak, 2005. The English Factory in Sindh, Zahoor Ahmed Khan Fiction House, Lahore In the early 19th century Thatta had declined to a population of about 20,000, from a high of 200,000 a century before. =British= Talpur rule ended in 1843 on the battlefield of Miani when General Charles James Napier captured the Sindh for the British Empire, and moved the capital of the Sindh from Hyderabad to Karachi. In 1847, Thatta was administered as part of the Bombay Presidency. In 1920, the estimated population of the city was 10,800. =Modern= After the independence of Pakistan most of the city's Hindu population, though like much of Sindh, migrated to India, Thatta did not experience the widespread rioting that occurred in Punjab and Bengal. In all, less than 500 Hindu were killed in all of Sindh between 1947 and 1948 as Sindhi Muslims largely resisted calls to turn against their Hindu neighbours. Hindus did not flee Thatta en masse until riots erupted in Karachi on 6 January 1948, which sowed fear in Sindh's Hindus. In the 1970s under the rule of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, Thatta's monuments were restored and some industry was relocated to Thatta.  Administration  The city serves as capital of Thatta District. On 23 April 2014, the government announced the formation of Sindh's sixth division, Banbhore Division, with Thatta as capital.http://abbtakk.tv/.../94282indh-govt- declares-thatta-sixth-division-of-province... These sources reveal that this formation is made to improve governance in Thatta.http://videos.arynews.tv/sindh-government-promoted-thatta-division/ Geography Thatta's geology is characterized by volcanic and sedimentary rocks that are similar to those in the Indus plain, and Thar Desert. Soil types in the region are silty, with some clay as well. Much of the soil is exposed to salinization from the Arabian Sea.

He was the elder brother of Paul Wentworth and entered as member for Barnstaple in 1571. He later sat for the Cornish borough of Tregony in 1578 and for the town of Northampton in the parliaments of 1586‚Äì7, 1589, and 1593.David Dean, \\"Wentworth, Peter (1524-97)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edition, January 2008 Wentworth was the chief critic of Queen Elizabeth I, and Wentworth's 1576 Parliament address has been regarded as the sign of a new era in English Parliament politicking.J. E. Neale, \\"Peter Wentworth\\", The English Historical Review, Vol. 39, No. 153. (Jan., 1924), 36. Recorded speeches and parliament sessions, jotted in the diaries of MPs like those of Thomas Cromwell, began to proliferate around this time, when public interest embraced political affairs and when issues such as freedom of speech took root in parliamentary politics. For these reasons, Wentworth is often regarded as the first celebrated English parliamentarian. Early life He was the son of Sir Nicholas Wentworth of Lillingstone Lovell, chief porter of Calais, and was trained for the law in Lincoln's Inn. He inherited the estate at Lillingstone Lovell on the death of his father in 1557. Career He entered Parliament as the MP for Barnstaple in 1571 and Tregony in 1572. Wentworth firmly supported the liberties of Parliament against encroachments of the royal prerogative, about which he delivered a memorable speech on 8 February 1576. The speech was interrupted before its conclusion due to Wentworth's provocative claims, and officials imprisoned him in the Tower of London. Below are the words that concluded the spoken part of Wentworth's speech. > Amongst other, Mr. Speaker, two things do great hurt in this place, of the > which I do mean to speak: the one is a rumour which runneth about the house > and this it is, \\"Take heed what you do, the queen's majesty liketh not such > a matter. Whosoever prefereth it, she will be offended with him\\". Or the > contrary, \\"Her majesty liketh of such a matter. Whosoever speaketh against > it, she will be much offended with him\\". The other: sometimes a message is > brought into the house, either of commanding or inhibiting, very injurious > to the freedom of speech and consultation. I would to God, Mr. Speaker, that > these two were buried in hell, I mean rumours and messages, for wicked they > undoubtedly are. The reason is, the devil was the first author of them, from > whom proceedeth nothing but wickedness...Peter Wentworth's speech, as > transcribed from lost documents by Sir Simonds D'Ewes. Graves, 105. It was here that Wentworth was interrupted, and the house decided \\"that he should be presently committed to the serjeant's ward as prisoner, and so remaining should be examined upon his said speech for the extenuating of his fault therein\\".D'Ewes, quoted by Graves, 105. The unspoken remainder of Wentworth's speech was preserved from the draft, and its rhetoric and content continue on much in the same manner until its ending.See Proceedings in the Parliaments of Elizabeth I, 1558-1581 [vol. I], ed. T.E. Hartley (Leicester: University of Leicester Press, 1981), 422. Eventually, Wentworth was released from the Tower after his incarceration there, and he was readmitted to Parliament. In 1586, 1589 and 1593 he was elected to represent Northampton. In February 1587, Sir Anthony Cope (1548‚Äì1614) presented to the Speaker a bill abrogating the existing ecclesiastical law, together with a Puritan revision of the Book of Common Prayer, and Wentworth supported him by bringing forward certain articles touching the liberties of the House of Commons; Cope and Wentworth were both committed to the Tower for interference with Elizabeth I's ecclesiastical prerogative. In 1593, Wentworth again suffered imprisonment for presenting a petition on the subject of the royal succession; and he did not regain his freedom, for he died in the Tower on 10 November 1596. While in the Tower he wrote A Pithie Exhortation to her Majesty for establishing her Successor to the Crown, a notable treatise preserved in the British Library. Family Peter Wentworth was then twice married; his first wife, Laetitia Lune, with whom he had no children, was the daughter of Sir Ralph Lune and Maud Parr, who was a cousin of Catherine Parr, and his second was Elizabeth Walsingham, a sister of Sir Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth's secretary of state. He and Elizabeth had children, including a daughter, Frances Wentworth. His third son, Thomas Wentworth (Recorder of Oxford) (c. 1568-1628), was an ardent and sometime violent opponent of royal prerogative in Parliament, of which he became a member in 1604: He represented the city of Oxford from that year until his death and became recorder of Oxford in 1607.

Biography Hoyt Sherman was born in Lancaster, Ohio, the son of Charles R. Sherman, Judge of the Ohio Supreme Court. He was the younger brother of US Federal Judge Charles Taylor Sherman, US Senator John Sherman the distinguished Ohio statesman, and of Major General William T. Sherman of Civil War fame. Until eighteen years of age, Hoyt's time was divided between school and the printing office. In the spring of 1848 he came to Fort Des Moines, Iowa, then far out on the western frontier. In 1849 he was admitted to the bar and began to practice law, and also engaged in real estate business. In March of that year he was appointed by President Zachary Taylor postmaster of Des Moines, holding that position until the inauguration of President Franklin Pierce, when he resigned and was elected clerk of the District Court. In 1854, he was the senior member of the banking house of Hoyt Sherman & Co., and upon the establishment of the State Bank of Iowa he became cashier of the Des Moines branch and was one of the directors on part of the State to supervise the system and guard the public interests. When the American Civil War began Mr. Sherman was appointed by President Abraham Lincoln paymaster in the Union army with the rank of major, holding the position for three years. He was one of the organizers of the Equitable Life Insurance Company of Iowa and for many years its general manager. That institution owes much of its stability and high standing to Major Sherman's reputation for integrity and skillful management. In 1866, Major Sherman was a member of the House of the Eleventh General Assembly where he was chairman of the committee on railroads and a member of the committee of ways and means. In 1886, he was one of the founders of the Pioneer Lawmakers' Association and was one of its most influential members, serving as president and long a member of the executive committee. He contributed valuable historical articles to the Annals of Iowa on \\"Early Banking in Iowa,\\" and on the \\"State Bank of Iowa.\\" For many years he was the chief executive officer of the Associated Charities of Des Moines. Sherman married Sara Elvira Moulton on December 25, 1855. One of their daughters, Adaline Moulton Sherman, was married to Frank Bestow Wiborg, and their children included Mary Hoyt Wiborg and Sara Sherman Wiborg. Hoyt Sherman Place In 1877 Hoyt Sherman built a grand manor; the structure is now a museum and performing arts center. The original house and gallery now display a collection of 19th- and 20th-century paintings, as well as elaborately carved 17th-century furniture and other rare artifacts. The mansion, now known as Hoyt Sherman Place, lent its name to the surrounding Des Moines neighborhood of Sherman Hill.

Ancillary laws may regulate forest land acquisition and prescribed burn practices. Forest management laws generally adopt management policies, such as multiple use and sustained yield, by which public forest resources are to be managed. Governmental agencies are generally responsible for planning and implementing forestry laws on public forest lands, and may be involved in forest inventory, planning, and conservation, and oversight of timber sales. Broader initiatives may seek to slow or reverse deforestation.  Purpose  Forestry laws are intended to protect resources and prevent forest clearing, logging, hunting, and collecting vegetation. However, there are no clear limitations set within these laws in regards to allowable cuts, harvesting rotations, and minimum harvesting diameters. Forest management plans state goals for the upkeep of the land, as well as steps to achieve them. foresters create management plans that account for each differentiated forest itself. In some cases, plans are made with the assumption that ecosystems within a forest are holding a steady state, separate from the forest that surrounds them. Many foresters who are in third world countries do not have the knowledge nor training to follow by all the guidelines when making a management plan. Tongass National Forest Appropriate public policies and legislation serve to foster sustainable economic and social development in rural and urban areas. These policies work to safeguard the environment and protect flora, fauna and cultural heritage. Traditionally, environmental protection has been an element of forestry through emphasizing forest conservation and accounting for environmental impacts on soil and water. In recent years, outside influences have had a substantial impact on the objectives of forestry and the contents of forest law. In common with other sectors, forestry has been affected by the emergence of environmental awareness and legislation in the last generation. This has brought greater emphasis on the protection of wilderness and aesthetic values. Influences Biological diversity and climate change have specifically influenced forest law. When forest management plans are created, biological diversity is represented in criteria for sustainability. Due to the Kyoto Protocol, the mitigation of climate change has become an objective of forest law and policy, complementing broader climate policies and programs. However, Rosenbaum and colleagues state that there is little legislation containing specific provisions for mitigating forest-based climate change.Christy, L., & Ebrary, Inc. 2007. Forest law and sustainable development addressing contemporary challenges through legal reform. World Bank, Washington, DC. The connections between forest and other areas of law have become more complex as they have grown in ambition and scope and as other areas directly and indirectly place guidelines on how forests are managed or used. Thus the links between a country's forest laws and its general environmental laws become more important as the environmental dimensions of forest legislation increase in complexity. Forest legislation now recognizes the role of forests as a habitat for wildlife, a resource for grazing and agriculture, and a contributor to water and soil conservation. More recently, the general principles of environmental law and the more specific values of biological diversity have become a very visible part of forest law. The UN Forum on Forests, an intergovernmental policy forum created in 2000, has adopted resolutions on the sustainable development of forests, especially those on Social and Cultural Aspects of Forest and Traditional Forest-Related Knowledge. International Forest law is not easily adapted between countries, as there are immense variations in nature, importance, and role of forest resources, as well as legal and institutional settings. While there have been important comparative studies of trends in forest legislation, they seldom provide direct practical guidance on how to assess improve the law. Actual practices differ from one country to the next, however, in all cases public forests are viewed as a national resource, that is, the sovereign property of the state. For example, even though most forest land in the United States and Canada is privately owned, a considerable amount is held by the state as a \\"public good\\" but systematically leased to private timber producers. In India, the Raj took ownership of virtually all forests, declaring them to be \\"wasteland\\" and, therefore, unowned. In Indonesia, forests are legally state owned but are treated as private property, while in Brazil, the lack of national government renders forests open access commons. In this role, the conservation of forests is tightly linked to the production of timber and other commodities that generate both capital and jobs, and the economies of large regions are almost wholly dependent on natural resource production from those forests. United Nations Forest Management Plan New forest laws have been adopted in Eastern European countries as part of their transition to a market economy. These laws had considerable effect on the structure of forest land ownership, improvements in management regulations, and modernization of the forest sector's institutional framework. New forest legislation has also been developed in several countries in Western Europe in order to adapt to changing economic conditions, social demands, and more political participation of interest groups and citizens at local and regional levels. =Economic and social context= The evolution of forest legislation in the European Countries indicates that understanding of how natural resources are to be used in a sustainable manner depends on a given economic and social context. The meaning of sustainable forestry is determined by local circumstances and their significance has considerably changed over time. Today sustainable management is understood as forestry practices which respect the naturally given potentials of the ecosystems and maintain the diversity of forests in their typical landscapes. They leave multiple options for an increasing production of wood, protection of the environment, and recreation. =Regulation of use= Public provisions referring to forest uses over more than one generation are among the oldest forms of long-term environmental policies. Customary law, codified in the 14th century, regulated forest uses in accordance with the demands and options of their times. An increasing number of forest and timber ordinances, issued from the 16th century onward, followed. Meeting local needs, long-term availability of raw materials and energy, and increased outputs through better forestry practices were the issues at stake. Legislation established the requirement of a continuous flow of wood production, which meant stopping exploitation of what was available. It recognized the long-term nature of forests, and promoted the involvement of several generations in forestry activities. Increasingly, it provided for planning and management, and for measures of regeneration and reforestation. This introduced principles of utilizing renewable natural resources as a requirement for sustainability as we understand it today. Economics New policies place responsibilities for, and powers over, wood fuel management into the hands of economically interested individuals and the Forest Service. The Forest Service maintains complete control of all production and management decisions through required approval and through control of the rules by which production and management can take place. The role of private forestry reaches up to over 80 percent of forest production in some countries. However, in many countries, private forestry has never been significant and, even when land has been privatized, the state has often retained the forests. In much of Africa, individual land ownership is relatively limited so that the closest approach to private forestry is usually community forestry (although South Africa and Swaziland, among other countries, have extensive private plantations). More recently, the values of farm forestry and of private capital and management have increased official interest in private forestry. Illegal forestry activities deprive governments of billions of dollars in tax revenues, as well as cause environmental damage and threaten forests. Forest related corruption and widespread violation of forestry laws undermines the rule of law, discourages legitimate investment, and gives unfair advantages. Money generated from illegal forestry activities has even been used to finance armed conflict. Concern about the extent to which illegal logging has been contributing to forest loss has grown sharply since the 1980s. A very large proportion of the timber entering both national and international markets has been accessed, harvested, transported and traded in contravention of national law in countries such as Bolivia, Brazil, Cambodia, Cameroon, Colombia, Honduras, Indonesia, Nicaragua, Peru, Philippines, and Russia. The World Bank (2002) estimates that illegal logging results in an annual loss of around US$10‚Äì15 billion in developing countries worldwide. Although it is anticipated that better governance, increased rent capture by the state, and improved forest management can all benefit the poor indirectly, the direct impacts of illegal logging and forest law enforcement on rural livelihoods have not been a priority consideration to date. Livelihood The ways in which people use and value forests are changing. Growing populations, changing culture, technology, and science are increasing the demand for forest resources. In recent years forest laws around the world have been significantly revised in response to these changes. However, the lack of information about who really uses forests presents a major problem to forestry policy makers and supportive development agencies that are mandated to adopt a pro-poor approach. Without clear data it becomes all too easy to overlook the interests of lower income individuals when designing policy interventions aimed at improving forest management or asserting forest law. Some forest laws specifically favor poor rural households and ethnic minorities. Over the last few decades, many governments in Latin America recognized indigenous peoples' rights over large territories, but indigenous people often find it difficult to protect those territories from invasion by loggers, miners, and farmers. According to the World Bank, \\"more than 1.6 billion people depend to varying degrees on forests for their livelihoods. About 60 million indigenous people are almost wholly dependent on forests. Some 350 million people who live in or adjacent to dense forests depend on them to a high degree for subsistence and income. In developing countries about 1.2 billion people rely on agroforestry farming systems that help to sustain agricultural productivity and generate income.\\" Forest law enforcement initiatives should seek to address the full range of laws that relate to forests and forest-dependent peoples, and not just forestry laws; adopt a rights-based approach to forest law enforcement with due attention paid to strengthening human rights networks, improving the independence of the judiciary, promoting legal literacy among rural communities, and providing legal aid; be linked to governance reform programs aimed at creating public accountability and transparency in the management of natural resources; be developed through processes of broad engagement with civil society organisations and based on national governments‚Äô commitments to reform. A large portion of forestry legislation focuses on administrative requirements, fees, taxes, and property rights, rather than on how forests are really managed. Of particular importance to forestry is that, even where governments or colonial powers have been willing to recognize individual claims, based on custom or usage, to land used for agriculture or housing, they have generally ignored traditional-group rights to areas used in common, such as forest or pasture. By treating such land as ‚Äúempty‚Äù during the process of settling rights, governments around the world have vested in the state ownership of vast expanses of forest land. Enforcement Law enforcement is the last resort for obtaining compliance with the law. There are at least three approaches to overcoming the difficulties of proving offenses that have taken place in remote locations. One is to focus enforcement on more visible acts, such as transport. Another, common in civil law, is to make the official report of a sworn official admissible as evidence in further proceedings. This effectively shifts the burden of proof to the defendant. A third device is the use of evidentiary presumptions, which similarly shifts the burden of proof to the defendant. In many countries the contrast between what forestry law prescribes and what actually happens on the ground is both stark and obvious. Even where the law is strong, illegal behavior by both public and private actors often continues. Some explanations for this are that forest departments lack the financial and human resources to monitor and control forest activities, which often take place in very remote areas; government officials entrusted with enforcing the law may be under immense pressure to condone violations, or engage in violations themselves; court systems are backlogged or bankrupt; the difficulties of daily life for the rural poor may overwhelm any likely risks associated with violating the law; etc. These explanations underscore the point that while good forestry legislation is necessary, it is obviously not sufficient. The laws in many countries lie unused or underused for reasons like failure of political will, weak institutions, or even general disregard for the rule of law. A dual approach of private as well as public law schemes might possibly become an interesting modern policy mix enhancing enforcement: private law certification schemes might support public regulations (f.i. DDS, due diligence systems, like the EU Timber Regulation).Kistenkas, Frederik Hendrik, Concurring regulation in European forest law. Forest certification and the new EU Timber Regulation, GAiA 22/3 (2013): 166-168. History and development In 1992, representatives of 180 of the world's nations met in Rio de Janeiro to consider, among other things, the adoption of an Agreement on Forestry Principles, entitled a \\"Non-legally binding authoritative statement of principles for a global consensus on the management, conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests.\\" Scientific forestry was based on the precise measurement of the distribution and volume of wood in a given parcel, the systematic felling of trees, and their replacement by standard, carefully aligned rows of mono-cultural plantations that could be harvested at set times. The tendencies that become apparent from recent changes in forest laws and regulations in several European countries show a variety of approaches and may be judged from different point of views. Relevant criteria for analysis on the advancement of legislation are consistency, comprehensiveness, subsidiarity, and applicability. Consistency requires the compatibility of forest regulations with constitutional values and democratic rules, with national policies addressing land-use, economic development and environmental protection, and with international commitments and multilateral agreements. Comprehensiveness refers to the objectives of forest legislation with regard to forest protection and forestry development, to different types of forest tenures, and to the rights and responsibilities of various categories of forest owners. Subsidiarity relates to the role of forests as national, regional and local resources. It also relates to the double nature of forests as private production means that may be used according to the decisions of land owners and as resources that yield numerous benefits to the community. Subsidiarity indicates to what extent public programs support the activities of land owners. Applicability refers in particular to the organisational framework of public forest administrations in relation to changing responsibilities and tasks, and to appropriate forms of participation of forest owners and interest groups in regulating forest uses and management practices. Coordination of competencies among public entities is an important aspect in evaluating the applicability of new or amended regulations.

The game was originally released in Japan on December 1, 1995 and later in North American and PAL regions in 1996. It is the third game in the Mega Man X series and the last to appear on the SNES. Mega Man X3 takes place in a fictional future in which the world is populated by humans and intelligent robots called \\"Reploids\\". Like their human creators, some Reploids involve themselves in destructive crime and are labelled as \\"Mavericks\\". After twice defeating the Maverick leader Sigma, the heroes Mega Man X and Zero must battle a Reploid scientist named Dr. Doppler and his utopia of Maverick followers. Mega Man X3 follows in the tradition of both the original Mega Man series and the Mega Man X series as a standard action-platform game. The player traverses a series of eight stages in any order while gaining various power-ups and taking the special weapon of each stage's end boss. Mega Man X3 is the first game in the series in which Zero is a playable character (albeit in limited form) in addition to X. Like its predecessor, Mega Man X2, X3 features the \\"Cx4\\" chip to allow for some limited 3D vector graphics and transparency effects. A 32-bit version of Mega Man X3 was released on the PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and Windows in various countries. The 3DO Interactive Multiplayer version was planned, but was canceled due to the fall of the console. This version was included on the North American Mega Man X Collection in 2006. The game was also ported to Japanese mobile phones in 2010. Critical reception for Mega Man X3 has been above average. However, the game, particularly the 32-bit version, has received miscellaneous criticism from reviewers for its lack of improvements to the series. Capcom announced that the SNES version of Mega Man X3 would be coming to the Wii U Virtual Console in 2014. It was released in North America on August 28, 2014, Japan on October 8, 2014 and the PAL regions on November 6, 2014. Recently, the SNES version was released on the PC, as well as the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch as part of Mega Man X Legacy Collection (Rockman X Anniversary Collection in Japan) which released on July 24, 2018 worldwide and July 26, 2018 in Japan. 2018-04-10, Jennifer Sherman, animenewsnetwork.com Mega Man X Legacy Collections Ship for PS4, Switch, Xbox One, PC in Japan on July 26 Mega Man X Legacy Collection 1 and 2 launch July 24th -Capcom Unity, Kellen, April 10, 2018 Plot The story of Mega Man X3 is set during the 22nd century (the year \\"21XX\\"), in which after Mega Man X2 humans coexist with intelligent robots called \\"Reploids\\" (replicant androids). Due to their free will, some Reploids are prone to criminal activity and are said to go \\"Maverick\\". Dr. Cain, the inventor of the Reploids, establishes a military taskforce called the \\"Maverick Hunters\\" to prevent it. Even after two successful efforts by the Hunters Mega Man X and Zero to stop a Maverick leader named Sigma from attempting to exterminate the human race, Maverick activity seems to continue. However, the threat of the Mavericks is later neutralized thanks to the technology of the Reploid scientist Dr. Doppler, which prevents the Mavericks from going berserk. The reformed Reploids form a utopia near their new mentor called \\"Dopple Town\\". It seemed that all is well until the former Reploids suddenly revert and once again begin causing trouble, even going so far as to attack Hunter headquarters. Doppler is held accountable, and X and Zero are sent out to contain the new threat. Once the two heroes defeat Doppler and the forces that have sworn allegiance to him, the scientist comes to his senses and realizes all the damage that he has done. He explains that Sigma is alive as a computer virus, and that Doppler was corrupted in order to create a new body for Sigma. X seeks out Sigma, and after an intense battle, the Sigma Virus in its pure form chases X in an attempt to infect and possess him. Once X finds himself at a dead end, one of two things may happen. In one of the game's endings, Zero takes Doppler's true antivirus software and uploads it onto his sabre offscreen. He rushes in to save X just in time and causes Sigma to explode, destroying the lab as they evacuate. However, if Zero is injured during the game, Doppler instead uses his own body as the antivirus and sacrifices himself for the greater good. Gameplay A charged-up Zero approaches an enemy in Toxic Seahorse's stage. Mega Man X3 is the first game in the series to feature Zero as a playable character. Mega Man X3 adopts the gameplay of Mega Man X and Mega Man X2, an expansion of the gameplay model of the original Mega Man series. These action- platform games involve taking control of the protagonist X and completing a series of eight, selectable stages. Each stage has a variety of obstacles, traps, and enemy robots to fight. The stage terminates in a Maverick boss fight; defeating this boss will add a new special weapon to the player's arsenal. Each boss is particularly weak to one special weapon, so the player may complete the stages in an order that best exploits these weaknesses. The player character X retains certain abilities from past games. Namely, he is able to run, jump, dash, cling to and scale most walls, and fire his chargeable \\"X-Buster\\" arm cannon and special weapons. The player can further upgrade X's abilities by collecting armor parts (head, body, legs, and X-Buster) found within capsules in some levels. Capsules containing special chips add new abilities as well. X is generally only able to benefit from one chip at a time, allowing the player to customize the character as needed. However, one hidden capsule gives X the benefits of all four special chips. Like the two previous Mega Man X games, the player can locate power-ups such as \\"Heart Tanks\\" for extending the maximum life energy and \\"Sub-Tanks\\" for storing energy for later use. Also returning are powerful \\"Ride Armor\\" vehicles that can be piloted in some of the stages. Items hidden within certain levels can be collected which allow the player to summon vehicles at any time. Mega Man X3 is the first game in the series which allows the player to play as X's ally Zero, although his playability is more limited compared to later games in the series. Zero can be called to take X's place during nearly any stage, but he cannot collect any of X's armor parts or power-ups, and cannot fight mid-stage or end-stage bosses, with only one exception that grants access to a secret weapon for X. If Zero is ever defeated in battle, he will be unable to be called upon for the rest of the game. Development and release By the time production began, Keiji Inafune, a major contributor to the Mega Man franchise, had transitioned from his role as an artist to director, producer, and writer. Starting with Mega Man X2, Inafune wanted to use a computer virus as a plot device, something he considered a more interesting idea than a tangible villain. Inafune's other duties included merchandising the game into toys and trading cards. Although the game's scenario, character designs and artwork were done at Capcom, much of the actual game design was sub-contracted to Minakuchi Engineering, who had previously developed most of the Mega Man games on the Game Boy along with the compilation game Mega Man: The Wily Wars for the Sega Mega Drive. Inafune recalled experiencing \\"psychological turmoil\\" over allowing \\"outsiders\\" to handle the game's development. Inafune's only illustrative designs for the game were the characters X, Zero, and Vile. Inafune admitted being very \\"possessive\\" of Zero, which he had vested interest in since the character's creation for the first Mega Man X. All of the designs for the game's other characters, bosses, and its minor enemies were divided among artists Hayato Kaji, Tatsuya Yoshikawa, Shinsuke Komaki, and Kazushi Itou. Mega Man X3 is graphically similar to its two predecessors, and even utilizes the SNES Cx4 from Mega Man X2. This digital signal processor cartridge chip allows for basic 3D graphical effects such as rotation, enlarging, and shrinking of wireframe objects. The North American and the European SNES version of Mega Man X3 are very rare due to their limited run and the fact that they were released during declining support of the console. Despite higher-than-expected retail orders for their SNES products, Capcom had lowered its shipping of 16-bit titles during the fall 1995 release quarter due to supply and demand. To give the game a chance of turning a profit in spite of its limited production run, Capcom had to price it higher than any previous Mega Man title ($73.95 at retail in the USA). In more recent times, Mega Man X3 cartridges fetch very large sums of money on collector and auction websites such as eBay. A port of Mega Man X3 was released on the Sega Saturn and PlayStation in Japan in 1996 and in Europe in 1997. Capcom stated that it was licensing these versions to a USA company for release in North America, but ultimately they were never released in the region. A Windows port of this 32-bit edition was released in Japan in 1997 and in North America and Europe in 1998 . The port versions feature additional animated full-motion video cutscenes, rearranged remixed music tracks, and completely different sound effects than the original SNES version. A port for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer was announced in Japan in 1996, but was not released. The Japanese PlayStation version of Mega Man X3 was eventually re-released as part of the Sony \\"The Best for Family\\" line of budget titles. The PlayStation version of Mega Man X3 was included in Mega Man X Collection, released for the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube in North America in early 2006. Finally, Mega Man X3 was released on EZweb- compatible mobile phones in Japan in 2010. The game's soundtrack was composed by freelancer Kinuyo Yamashita, who created all the music and converted it to data in her leisure. Although the Minakuchi Engineering Staff is credited in the game's soundtrack album, Yamashita worked for them in a freelance capacity rather than being an actual employee of the company. The Japanese 32-bit editions feature two J-pop vocal songs by Kotono Shibuya: the opening theme \\"One More Time\\" and the ending theme \\"I'm Believer\\". Both the SNES and 32-bit versions of the musical score were included on the second disc of Capcom Music Generation: Rockman X1 ~ X6 soundtrack released by Suleputer in 2003. Reception Press reception for Mega Man X3 was mostly positive. Reviewers praised the game's tried-and-true gameplay, graphics, control, and the option to play as Zero. Mike Weigand of GamePro was generally pleased with the game, and, though he admitted it brought little new to the franchise, enjoyed the increased difficulty, tight controls, and new special effects. Weigand summarized, \\"It may be routine for experience players, but anyone who hasn't played a 16-bit game in the series will discover Mega magic.\\" GameFan reviewer Dave Halverson was equally impressed by the \\"speed, diversity, special FX, and power up's,\\" calling it \\"a fitting 16-bit finale to a great series\\". IGN similarly asserted Mega Man X3 as \\"a solid send-off for the 16-bit era\\", naming it the 67th-best SNES of all time on a 2011 list. Two of Electronic Gaming Monthlys reviewers considered the game an improvement over X2 with its larger levels and huge number of secrets, while the other two focused on its overt similarity to previous games in the series. Some felt Mega Man X3 was too similar to past Mega Man games. Super Play writer Jonathan Davies found the game far too similar to Mega Man X2, questioning whether or not \\"Capcom are cashing in on their loyal fans\\". All but one of the four reviewers for Electronic Gaming Monthly complained that the game is too similar to other Mega Man games, with one writing: \\"I am so sick of Mega Man, that I have dreams at night of the blue-clothed hero showing up at my house and forcing me to play more of his redundant titles. This latest release is just like all the rest.\\" Likewise, 1UP.com writer Jeremy Parish thought that the game differed little from past releases, complaining that it was \\"more of the same, but with a kitchen-sink design philosophy that made every single level feel like a sluggish, ill-designed mess.\\" GameSpot editors Christian Nutt and Justin Speer specifically felt the number of power-ups and bonuses overshadowed the gameplay, barely benefiting from the addition of Zero as a limited playable character. The port versions of the game suffered more negative criticism than their SNES counterpart. The level designs and overall gameplay were highly criticized by Computer Games Magazine contributor Nathan Smith, who reviewed the late Windows release of the game. \\"Packing more clich√© console conventions than you can shake a gamepad at,\\" Smith opined, \\"you'll need the patience of Job, the manual dexterity of a nine-year-old, and the intelligence of Forrest Gump to really enjoy this one.\\" Saturn Power denoted Mega Man X3 the worst Saturn title in the console's available game library. Matt Yeo of Sega Saturn Magazine had fair comments about Mega Man X3 as an SNES game, but labeled the UK Saturn version \\"a bit of a travesty\\" due to its lack of innovation and a \\"dubious\\" quality of the anime cutscenes. Halverson enjoyed the use of redbook audio in the 32-bit conversion despite not finding the music particularly memorable. Both Yeo and Halverson were dismayed by the use of letterbox borders in the Saturn version, which horizontally reduce the screen size.

St Fergus lies from the North Sea coast and north-west of Peterhead. The Parish of St Fergus includes the remains of Inverugie Castle and Ravenscraig Castle. The church in the village was built in 1763. The church for this parish previously stood in the old kirkyard near the shore to the east. This site on the St Fergus Links is still used as a burial ground. Prior to the change in site of the church the parish was known as Longley and at a still more remote period Inverugie. History Historically, the of St Fergus parish formed a detached portion of Banffshire. The parish was transferred to Aberdeenshire in 1891. At that time it had a population of 1,527. The beach area was classed as a risk during WW2 as a possible landing area for a German invasion. Several pillboxes and anti-tank blocks were placed along the coast. These formed part of the Rattray stop line. Anti-tank ditches are still visible today. A minefield was laid on St Fergus links and Craigwan sands. On 30 November 1941, 11-year-old John Paul, 12-year-old James Reekie and Corporal Ronald Cumbley of the Royal Engineers were killed by a landmine. Two other soldiers were also injured. On 26 March 1946, Lance Corporal Reginald Wallis, age 26, and Corporal John Wood, age 23, of 11 Bomb Disposal company were killed whilst clearing landmines from the area. Corporal Wood stepped on the mine detonating it. During mine clearing operations by 11th Company Bomb Disposal, a British Empire Medal was awarded to Sgt Robert Husband. Sgt Husband assisted a platoon officer dealing with mines that had fallen down a cliff when rough weather caused a bank of sand to collapse. The St Fergus Gas Terminal situated to the north of the village, began operating in 1977 and was officially opened on 9 May 1978. The terminal consists of plants operated by a number of different oil and gas companies, and processes up to of North Sea gas per day, amounting to 15% of the United Kingdom gas demand.

One of their first recordings, \\"Gone with the Wind\\" got them a call from Dick Clark. Subsequently, they made many appearances on Dick Clark's American Bandstand. In New York City, Morty Craft had a song he wanted them to record, \\"Alone (Why Must I Be Alone)\\". In 1957, \\"Alone\\" would become their biggest hit and their signature song. In the U.S. it reached No. 18 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart; in the UK Singles Chart it made No. 14.

He is best known for his Epigrammes in the Oldest Cut, and Newest Fashion (1599), containing epigrams on Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, and other poets of his day, and for his Ancient Funerall Monuments, the first full-length book to be dedicated to the topic of English church monuments and epitaphs, which was published in 1631, the year before his death. Life Weever was a native of Preston, Lancashire. Little is known of his early life, and his parentage is not certain. He may be the son of the John Weever who in 1590 was one of thirteen followers of local landowner Thomas Langton put on trial for murder after a riot which took place at Lea Hall, Lancashire. He was educated at Queens' College, Cambridge, where he was admitted as a sizar on 30 April 1594. Weever's first tutor at Cambridge was William Covell, himself a native of Lancashire and author of Polimanteia (1595) which contains one of the first printed notices of Shakespeare. Another of Weever's tutors was Robert Pearson, whom in later life he mentions with gratitude as a \\"reverend, learned divine\\". It is possible that Weever considered a career in the church himself but after receiving his degree on 16 April 1598 he appears to have left Cambridge and travelled to London, where he immersed himself in the literary scene. He was in York in 1603 and later apparently in Lancashire. However, he eventually settled in London and married, buying a house in the parish of St. James, Clerkenwell. Works In late 1599 Weever published Epigrammes in the Oldest Cut, and Newest Fashion, containing epigrams on Shakespeare, Samuel Daniel, Michael Drayton, Ben Jonson, Edmund Spenser, William Warner and Christopher Middleton, all of which are valuable to the literary historian. The epigram on Shakespeare is particularly interesting since it follows the typical Shakespearean sonnet form: this may indicate Weever had seen actual examples of Shakespeare's sonnets, which at that date circulated only in manuscript. Many other epigrams however relate to persons Weever knew at Cambridge and presumably were composed while he was still a student there. The book also has commendatory verses by some of Weever's Cambridge friends. In 1600 he published Faunus and Melliflora, which begins as an erotic poem in the style of Shakespeare's Venus and Adonis and after a thousand lines in this vein abruptly veers toward satire, with a description of the mythological origins of the form and translations of satires by classical authors. It concludes with references to contemporary satirists Joseph Hall and John Marston, and also to the Bishops' Ban of 1599, which ordered the calling in and destruction of satirical works by Thomas Nashe and others. In 1601 an anonymous pamphlet called The Whippinge of the Satyre was published, which attacks three figures referred to as the Epigrammatist, the Satirist and the Humorist. These three are taken to refer to the contemporary writers Everard Guilpin, author of Skialetheia. or, A shadowe of Truth (1598), his kinsman John Marston, and Ben Jonson. It has been convincingly argued that Weever was the author of this pamphlet, and that as a result he was attacked in his turn and lampooned onstage as the character Asinius Bubo in Thomas Dekker's Satiromastix, as Simplicius Faber in Marston's What You Will and as Shift in Jonson's Every Man Out of His Humour. All these three characters are represented as being very small in stature and great lovers of tobacco, two characteristics which Weever himself admits to in his later works. In 1601 Weever also published two more serious works of a religious tone, The Mirror of Martyrs and An Agnus Dei. The Mirror of Martyrs or The Life and Death of ... Sir John Oldcastle may have been part of a backlash. In his preface Weever calls it the \\"first trew Oldcastle\\", perhaps on account of the fact that Shakespeare's character Falstaff first appeared as \\"Sir John Oldcastle\\". Weever's work is influenced by John Bale's 1544 biography of Oldcastle, which presents him as a proto- Protestant martyr. In the fourth stanza of this long poem, in which Sir John is his own panegyrist, occurs a reminiscence of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar which serves to fix the date of the play. Weever's other work of this year, An Agnus Dei, is the life of Christ told in verse form. It has little literary merit but went through several editions, perhaps because it was produced as a tiny book less than two inches square. The Mirror of Martyrs was reprinted in 1872 for the Roxburghe Club. Ancient Funerall Monuments As early as his first publication in 1599 Weever had demonstrated an interest in tomb monuments. Developing this, he spent the first three decades of the seventeenth century collecting monumental inscriptions. He travelled throughout England and to parts of Scotland, France, the Low Countries and Italy. Back in England he made friends among the chief antiquaries of his time, including Sir Robert Cotton and the herald Augustine Vincent. The result of his endeavours appeared as Ancient Funerall Monuments, a folio volume published in 1631. The work included a lengthy introductory global overview of his subject, the \\"Discourse of Funerall Monuments\\"; and this was followed by a survey of over a thousand inscriptions in the four south-eastern dioceses of England: Canterbury, Rochester, London and Norwich. The book is particularly valuable on account of the subsequent loss of many of these inscriptions. However, Weever viewed the inscriptions primarily as literary survivals, and (unlike some of his contemporaries) took little interest in the genealogical evidence they provided, or in the heraldic elements of many monuments: Graham Parry comments, \\"[i]t is fair to say that he ignored half the value of a memorial.\\"Parry 1995, p. 193. Nor was he concerned with their sculptural or architectural features, and he made no drawings on his travels. The published volume contains just eighteen illustrative woodcuts, all of which appear to have been added only at the production stage, and to have been based on drawings supplied by antiquarian friends. The Society of Antiquaries holds two notebooks in Weever's own hand (MSS 127 and 128) which contain a partial early draft of Ancient Funerall Monuments, as well as other material not included in the published volume. Death and commemoration Weever died between mid- February and late March 1632, and was buried at St James, Clerkenwell. He was commemorated by a marble tablet framed with a black border, and inscribed with a lengthy encomium in verse (afterwards published in the 1633 edition of John Stow's Survey of London). The monument was lost when the church was demolished for rebuilding in 1788, despite some ineffectual efforts by the Society of Antiquaries to preserve it.Honigmann 1987, pp. 82‚Äì85. The engraved frontispiece to Ancient Funerall Monuments includes a portrait of Weever, giving his age as 55; and also the following self-penned doggerel summary of his life: > Lanchashire gave him breath, And Cambridge education. His studies are of > Death. Of Heaven his meditation.Reproduced in Parry 1995, p. 191. Personal life Weever's wife's first name was Anne, but it is unclear from the surviving records whether she was Anne Edwards, who married a man named John Weaver in St James Church, Clerkenwell, in 1614; Anne Panting, who married a John Weaver in the same church in 1617; or neither of these.Kathmann 2004 She may have been the Anne Weaver of Clerkenwell who drew up her will in 1647, and whose maiden name may have been Onion.Honigmann 1987, pp. 58‚Äì59, 81‚Äì82.

The genesis of German Fest occurred when Mayor Henry Maier challenged the local German-American community during a speech on May 20, 1980, at the 20th Anniversary of the German American National Congress (DANK) to organize a German festival. Shortly thereafter, Walter Geissler, then President of D.A.N.K., chaired a committee of five members that laid the foundation for the Fest. The charter of German Fest was subsequently written in January 1981. The first German Fest was held in August 1981. It is billed as the \\"Largest German celebration in North America\\" and \\"A Milwaukee Tradition\\". It currently occurs during the last full weekend in July. As of 1993, Milwaukee had a 52% German population, which is the largest European percentage in a major U.S. metropolitan area. German Fest celebrates the culture, food, travel, and history of Germany, as well as Switzerland, Austria, Liechtenstein, South Tyrol, and German-speaking communities around the world. Along with traditional music, many from the Europe also make the journey to perform and educate at the festival. One attraction is the cultural tent, where one can see the various groups, including both former and current provinces that proudly call themselves \\"German.\\" They range from Bavarians (Bayern), and Hessians (Hessen), to other German speaking nations like the Austrians (√ñsterreich), and groups displaced by World War II whose homelands are now located in Poland (Polen), Hungary (Ungarn), and the former Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia (Tschechoslowakei & Jugoslawien). In the center area of the grounds a parade periodically passes by, showcasing 38 German-American heritage organizations, local German immersion schools, and others celebrating their German heritage. German cuisine is also featured at German Fest. Many well-known German restaurants and food services in the area are present at the fest, including Mader's, and the Schwabenhof, as well as the biggest sausage maker in Milwaukee, Usinger's. Usinger's celebrated its 125th anniversary in 2005, in a joint anniversary of German Fest's 25th anniversary. The 40th was to have taken place in 2020; however, the COVID-19 pandemic caused officials to defer it to 2021.

The project's goal is to comprehensively catalog runestones in a machine-readable way for future research. The database is freely availableLadda ned Samnordisk runtextdatabas via the Internet with a client program, called Rundata, for Microsoft Windows and text files for other operating systems. History The origin of the Rundata project was a 1986 database of Swedish inscriptions at Uppsala University for use in the Scandinavian Languages Department. At a seminar in 1990 it was proposed to expand the database to cover all Nordic runic inscriptions, but funding for the project was not available until a grant was received in 1992 from the Axel och Margaret Ax:son Johnsons foundation. The project officially started on January 1, 1993 at Uppsala University. After 1997, the project was no longer funded and work continued on a voluntary basis outside of normal work-hours. In the current edition, published on December 3, 2008, there are over 6500 inscriptions in the database. Work is currently underway for the next edition of the database. Format of entries Each entry includes the original text, its format, location, English and Swedish translations, information about the stone itself, et cetera. The stones are identified with a code which consists of up to three parts. The first part describes the origin of the inscription. For Swedish inscriptions this contains a code for the province, and, for Extra-Nordic inscriptions, a code for the country (not ISO 3166). Province code: *Bo - Bohusl√§n *D - Dalarna *G - Gotland *Gs - G√§strikland *Hs - H√§lsingland *J - J√§mtland *Lp - Lappland *M - Medelpad *N√§ - N√§rke *Sm - Sm√•land *S√∂ - S√∂dermanland *U - Uppland *Vg - V√§sterg√∂tland *Vr - V√§rmland *Vs - V√§stmanland *√ñg - √ñsterg√∂tland *√ñl - √ñland Country code: *BR - British Islands *DR - Denmark (includes Sk√•ne, Halland, Blekinge, and Southern Schleswig). Stone numbers taken from Jacobsen & Moltke ' (1941-1942) *FR - Faroe Islands *GR - Greenland *IR - Ireland *IS - Iceland *N - Norway *X - Other areas The second part of the code consists of a serial number or a previous method of cataloging. The third part of the code is a character which indicates the age (Proto-Norse, Viking Age, or Middle Ages) and whether the inscription is lost or retranslated. *# \\\\- inscription lost, later replaced with ‚Ä† *$ - newly retranslated *M - inscription from the Middle Ages *U - inscription in Proto-Norse, i.e. before ca 800. *[inscription from the Viking Age, if M or U are not present] As such, U 88 would mean that the stone is from Uppland and that it is the 88th to be catalogued. This system has its origin in the book Sveriges runinskrifter (English: \\"Runic Inscriptions of Sweden\\") Time periods used in Rundata Most of the time, the Period/Datering information in Rundata just gives the date as V, meaning Viking Age, which is very broad. For some Danish inscriptions from Jacobsen & Moltke a more precise sub-period is given. The periods used are: * Heln√¶s- G√∏rlev ‚Äî c. 800 (or 750 - c. 900) * f√∂r-Jelling (pre-Jelling) ‚Äî c. 900 * Jelling (Jelling) ‚Äî 10th century and into the 11th century * efter-Jelling (post-Jelling) ‚Äî c. 1000 ‚Äì 1050 * kristen efter-Jelling (Christian, post- Jelling) ‚Äî 1st half of the 11th century Many of the inscriptions in Rundata also include a field called Stilgruppering. This refers to date bands determined by the style of ornamentation on the stone as proposed by Gr√§slund: The date bands are: * RAK ‚Äî c. 990-1010 AD * FP ‚Äî c. 1010-1050 AD * Pr1 ‚Äî c. 1010-1040 AD * Pr2 ‚Äî c. 1020-1050 AD * Pr3 ‚Äî c. 1050 - a generation forward (en generation fram√•t) * Pr4 ‚Äî c. 1060-1100 AD * Pr5 ‚Äî c. 1100-1130 AD Original reference works The catalog numbers refer to a variety of reference works and scholarly publications.

Detail from Found by Dante Gabriel Rossetti, 1854. A smock-frock or smock is an outer garment traditionally worn by rural workers, especially shepherds and waggoners, in parts of England and Wales throughout the 18th century. Today, the word smock refers to a loose overgarment worn to protect one's clothing, for instance by a painter. The traditional smock-frock is made of heavy linen or wool and varies from thigh- length to mid-calf length. Characteristic features of the smock-frock are fullness across the back, breast, and sleeves folded into \\"tubes\\" (narrow unpressed pleats) held in place and decorated by smocking, a type of surface embroidery in a honeycomb pattern across the pleats that controls the fullness while allowing a degree of stretch. Types of smock-frocks Walter Langley, Between The Tides, 1901, Fishermen wear knit-frocks and fisherman's smocks * The round smock is a pullover style with an open neckline and a flat, round collar. This smock is reversible front-to-back.Marshall pp. 20‚Äì22 A feature of Sussex smocks or round frocks is the lack of elaborate decoration; instead there is fine embroidery on the yoke, collar, cuffs and shoulder. Sussex smocks were thought to be the most elaborate of smocks. * The shirt smock or Surrey smock is styled like a man's shirt, with a collar and a short placket opening in the front. It is not reversible.Marshall p. 25 * The coat smock worn by Welsh shepherds is long and buttons up the front in the manner of a coat.Marshall pp. 28‚Äì32 * The fisherman's smock is a fully reversible hardwearing sailcloth smock typically dyed indigo (or white or red colour) once worn as an outer garment by Atlantic fishermen across Devon, Cornwall, Brittany and the Channel Islands, and other parts of Northwestern Europe, often worn over a knitted gansey. It is now often favoured as an artist's smock by association with the Newlyn School who often depicted characters in this dress. * The knit-frock (Cornish use), Gansey or Guernsey is a worsted knitted form of the fisherman's smock, often patterned and dyed indigo, it was again traditionally fully reversible and was again found throughout the fishing communities of the Atlantic from Brittany to the Netherlands. It was often oversized to midthigh.Mary Wright, Cornish Guernseys & Knit-frocks, 2008 Polperro Heritage Press. Development Detail from May Day by Kate Greenaway. The child in green wears a smock-frock. (Complete image here.) Liberty art fabrics advertisement showing a smocked dress, May 1888 It is uncertain whether smock-frocks are \\"frocks made like smocks\\" or \\"smocks made like frocks\\"‚Äîthat is, whether the garment evolved from the smock, the shirt or underdress of the medieval period, or from the frock, an overgarment of equally ancient origin. What is certain is that the fully developed smock- frock resembles a melding of the two older garments. From the earlier 18th century, the smock-frock was worn by waggoners and carters; by the end of that century, it had become the common outer garment of agricultural labourers of all sorts throughout the Midlands and Southern England. The spread of the smock-frock matches a general decrease in agricultural wages and living standards in these areas in the second half of the 18th century. The smocks were cheaper than other forms of outer garments, and were both durable and washable.Styles, p. 27‚Äì28 Embroidery styles for smock-frocks varied by region, and a number of motifs became traditional for various occupations: wheel- shapes for carters and wagoners, sheep and crooks for shepherds, and so on. Most of this embroidery was done in heavy linen thread, often in the same color as the smock. By the mid-19th century, wearing of traditional smock- frocks by country laborers was dying out, although Gertrude Jekyll noticed them in Sussex during her youth, and smocks were still worn by some people in rural Buckinghamshire into the 1920s. As the authentic tradition was fading away, a romantic nostalgia for England's rural past, as epitomized by the illustrations of Kate Greenaway, led to a fashion for women's and children's dresses and blouses loosely styled after smock-frocks. These garments are generally of very fine linen or cotton and feature delicate smocking embroidery done in cotton floss in contrasting colors; smocked garments with pastel-colored embroidery remain popular for babies.Marshall, pp. 17‚Äì19 Parachutist smocks During World War II, military parachutists wore wind proof jump smocks primarily to cover equipment that may have caused the parachutist to be stuck in a narrow doorway. German parachutists wore the Knochensack, British parachutists wore the Denison smock whilst US Marine paramarines wore a jump smock as well. Today the name smock is still used for military combat jackets, particularly in the UK; in the Belgian army the borrowed English term has been corrupted to smoke-vest. Examples include DPM Parachute Smock, that replaced the Denison Smock, the Canadian Para Smock and Smock Windproof DPM.

She is the founder of Comme des Gar√ßons and Dover Street Market. In recognition of the notable design contributions of Kawakubo, an exhibition of her designs entitled Rei Kawakubo/Commes des Gar√ßons, Art of the In-Between opened on 5 May 2017 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.Vogue Magazine. Announcement of Kawakubo exhibition in New York 2017  Early life and education  Rei Kawakubo was born on 11 October 1942 in Tokyo. Her early life in Japan was summarized by Judith Thurman in a New Yorker article from 2005 stating: \\"She was the oldest of her parents' three children and their only daughter... Their father was an administrator at Keio University, a prestigious institution founded by the great Meiji educator and reformer Fukuzawa Yukichi, a champion of Western culture and, according to Kawakubo, of women's rights.\\" Although not formally trained as a fashion designer, Kawakubo did study fine arts and literature at Keio University. As reported by Thurman, \\"In 1960, Kawakubo enrolled in her father's university and took a degree in 'the history of aesthetics', a major that included the study of Asian and Western art.\\" After graduation in 1964, Kawakubo worked in the advertising department at the textile company Asahi Kasei and she went on to work as a freelance stylist in 1967.[1] Two years later, she began to design and make her own clothes under the label Comme des Gar√ßons, French for \\"like the boys\\", before incorporating the label in 1973. Career: 1969‚Äì2003 In 1969, she established her own company, Comme des Gar√ßons Co. Ltd in TokyoKlensch, E. (1 August 1987). Fashion: Another world of style: Rei kawakubo. Vogue,177, 306-306, 307, 308, 309, 377. and opened up her first boutique there in 1975. Starting out with women's clothes, Kawakubo added a men's line in 1978. Three years later, she started presenting her fashion lines in Paris each season with Vladislav Bachinskyy , opening up a boutique in Paris in 1982.Bodine, S., & Idzelis, D. (2002). Kawakubo, Rei. In T. Benbow-Pfalzgraf (Ed.), Contemporary Fashion (2nd ed., pp. 365-368). Detroit: St. James Press. Comme des Gar√ßons specialises in anti-fashion, austere, sometimes deconstructed garments. After the end of her first decade with Comme de Garcons, in 1982, Kawakubo began to express her dissatisfaction with the early direction of some of her design ideas stating: \\"Three years ago I became dissatisfied with what I was doing. I felt I should be doing something more directional, more powerful. In fashion we had to get away from the influence of what had been done in the 1920s or the 1930s. We had to get away from the folkloric. I decided to start from zero, from nothing, to do things that have not been done before, things with a strong image.\\"Andrew Bolton. Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Gar√ßons: Art of the In-Between Hardcover, forthcoming 30 May 2017, Hardcover: 248 pages; Publisher: Metropolitan Museum of Art (30 May 2017); Language: English; . By 1980, CDG had flourished and according to Thurman, \\"had a hundred and fifty franchised shops across Japan, eighty employees, and annual revenues of thirty million dollars.\\" During the 1980s, her garments were primarily in black, dark grey or white. The emphasis on black clothing led to the Japanese press describing Kawakubo and her followers as 'The Crows'. The materials were often draped around the body and featured frayed, unfinished edges along with holes and a general asymmetrical shape. Challenging the established notions of beauty she created an uproar at her debut Paris fashion show where journalists labeled her clothes 'Hiroshima chic' amongst other things. Since the late 1980s, her colour palette has grown somewhat. Kawakubo likes to have input in all the various aspects of her business, rather than just focusing on clothes and accessories. She is greatly involved in graphic design, advertising, and shop interiors believing that all these things are a part of one vision and are inextricably linked. Her Aoyama, Tokyo, store is known for its sloping glass facade decorated with blue dots. This was designed in collaboration between Rei and architect Future Systems and interior designer Takao Kawasaki. Kawakubo published her own bi-annual magazine, 'Six' (standing for 'sixth sense'), in the early 1990s. It featured very little text and consisted mainly of photographs and images that she deemed inspiring. In 1996 Rei was guest editor of the high art publication Visionaire. Kawakubo is known to be quite reclusive and media shy, preferring her innovative creations to speak for themselves. Prior to 2002, Kawakubo has continued support for the use of LGBT references and cultural themes in the photography used in her advertisement and marketing campaigns promoting her clothing and accessories. Career: 2003‚Äì2018 Since 2003, Kawakubo has been referenced and cited by other major designers for her originality and contribution to fashion and design marked by a nationally broadcast program of interviews concerning her work by NHK (Japan Broadcasting Company).Unlimited: Comme des Garcons, Edited by Sanae Shimazu for NHK, Heibousha Press, 2003. During the interviews broadcast, Alexander McQueen stated: \\"When Kawakubo designs a collection, it seems kind of absurd, not just to the general public. But when you watch someone's challenging themselves like she does every season, it makes you understand why you are in fashion in the first place because of people like her.\\" During the same broadcast, Viktor & Rolf added: \\"The first time we became aware of Comme de Garcons was in the 80s. I think we were 12 or 13. It made a very strong impression because fashion in general was something that we were starting to discover and Rei Kawakubo was part of this ... an enormous outburst of creativity in the beginning of the 80s. So for us she was part of the way we started to think about fashion.\\" left Two other early supporters of Kawakubo were Jean-Paul Gaultier and Donna Karan. During the NHK broadcast for Kawakubo, Gaultier stated: \\"I believe that Kawakubo is a woman with extreme courage. She is a person with exceptional strength. Moreover, she has a poetic spirit. When I see her creations, I feel the spirit of a young girl. A young girl who still has innocence and is a bit romantic. Yet she also has an aspect of a fighting woman, one who fears nothing as she thrusts forward.\\" During the same broadcast of interviews in Japan, Donna Karan added: \\"Rei Kawakubo is a very interesting designer to me as a woman and a female designer. As a person, she is very quiet and rather withdrawn, yet her clothes make such an enormous statement.\\" According to Women's Wear Daily, she is a fashion icon but, during an interview, she said she does not think of herself as an icon. Her designs have inspired many other late designers like the Belgian Martin Margiela and Ann Demeulemeester, as well as Austrian designer Helmut Lang. Comme des Gar√ßons collections are designed in the Comme des Gar√ßons studio in Aoyama, Tokyo and are made in Japan, France, Spain, and Turkey. The 2006 autumn/winter collection dealt with the concept of the \\"persona\\", the different ways we present ourselves to the world. Fusing tailored menswear with more feminine elements such as corsets and flower printed dress fabrics, \\"Persona\\" was another collection that combined the feminine with the masculine by Comme des Gar√ßons. Junya Watanabe and, more recently, Tao KuriharaLiberty: Designer Room have started their own sub-labels under the Comme des Gar√ßons name to much acclaim. Both also were involved in designing for the casual women's knitwear line \\"Comme des Gar√ßons Tricot\\". Comme des Gar√ßons have collaborated with various other labels over the years including Fred Perry, Levi's Converse All Star, Speedo, Nike, Moncler, Lacoste, Cutler and Gross, Chrome Hearts, Hammerthor,vmagazine.com Comme des Gar√ßons and the most avant-garde underwear around S. N. S. Herning, Louis Vuitton, Supreme, and many others. Comme des Gar√ßons and H&M; collaborated on a collection which was released in the fall of 2008. Kawakubo created the 2008 autumn \\"guest designer\\" collection at H&M;, designing men's and women's clothing along with some children's and a unisex perfume. Rei is also known for establishing Dover Street Market, whose design ethos can be described as a Comme Des Garcons version of a department store. Originally created in 2004 in London's Dover Street, more DSM locations have opened in Tokyo, Beijing, Singapore, New York and Los Angeles. A multi-brand store, Dover Street Market puts particular emphasis on visual marketing and on emerging talents; DSM was the first international stockist for Russian Designer Gosha Rubchinskiy and now handle Rubchinskiy's marketing, production and operations. In an article for Business of Fashion in April 2017, Tim Blanks reported generated revenue for CDG and its affiliates as \\"over $280 million a year\\".Tim Blanks. Business of Fashion. \\"A Punk's Pain\\". 24 April 2017. . Vogue magazine and the Metropolitan Museum in New York have announced that an exhibition dedicated to Kawakubo is scheduled for its 2017 season between 4 May 2017 and 4 September 2017. In an interview with Vogue in April 2017, Andrew Bolton, the curator for the Kawakubo exhibit at the Met stated: \\"I really think her influence is so huge, but sometimes it‚Äôs subtle. It‚Äôs not about copying her; it‚Äôs the purity of her vision... Rei was really involved in the design of the exhibit\\". Bolton also stated that the exhibit in May 2017 is to be titled \\"Art of the In-Between\\", and will be an austere, all-white maze hosting approximately 150 Comme ensembles. Both the exhibit and accompanying book by Bolton are based upon the recurrent fashion dichotomies concentrating on nine thematic conceptual pairings listed as: (1) absence/presence; (2) design/not design; (3) fashion/antifashion; (4) model/multiple; (5) high/low; (6) then/now; (7) self/other; (8) object/subject; and (9) clothes/not clothes. In an early positive review of the exhibit at its opening, Matthew Schneier writing for The New York Times on 1 May 2017 referred to it stating that: \\"The exhibition, 150 outfits in all, is overpowering.\\" Writing for The New Republic on 3 May 2017, Josephine Livingston stated: \\"The clothes... are undeniable. Their presence felt like a statement: Here we are, the most influential forms from the least compromising genius. The exhibition shows about 150 pieces of Kawakubo‚Äôs women‚Äôs wear for Comme des Gar√ßons, from the early 1980s to the present day.\\"  Design work inspiration  Being one of fashion's most influential designers, Rei Kawakubo strives to challenge the form the traditional garment. Kawakubo is the second living designer to be honored for an exhibition at the Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. This Comme des Gar√ßons exhibition in particular highlights key themes that have inspired and continue to inspire her creativity as a designer. In the context of the human form, the body is radically reconsidered. She proposes new ideas of beauty by creating organic forms and protrusions in her garments, creating outfits that discard standard sizes. An example of an exhibition in which she radically questions form is her spring/summer 1997 collection, known as ‚ÄúBody Meets Dress, Dress Meets Body.‚Äù Through this exhibition Kawakubo is targeting body modification through dress, generating unstructured dresses and forms that don't highlight on erogenous zones of the body. By doing this, she is also questioning ideas surrounding gender and the body creating transgressive forms, discarding stereotypes surrounding the female. One of her latest collections in which these themes are seen is her fall/winter 2017 collection ‚Äî which she called ‚Äúthe future of silhouette‚Äù. Though Kawakubo is a female designer, she has made a point to state how her femininity doesn't at all influence her work. By generating transgressive forms she strives to completely disregard gendered stereotypes, even in context of the male. Legacy In an interview with Vanessa Friedman for The New York Times following the opening of Kawakubo's 2017 exhibition for the Met, Adrian Joffe, her husband, indicated in a taped 70-minute interview that this exhibition would likely be the last one which Kawakubo, now 74, would participate in personally. Joffe stated that Kawakubo might remain open to the possibility of allowing the current exhibition at the Met to be moved to other locations and museums around the world after it ends its venue in New York on 4 September 2017, though a newly designed exhibition on other themes or concepts was strongly discounted.  Personal life  Between the 1980s and 1990s Kawakubo was in a relationship with fellow 'Hiroshima Chic' fashion designer Yohji Yamamoto, but the relationship ended. Kawakubo later went on to marry Adrian Joffe, the current CEO of Comme des Gar√ßons and Dover Street Market. She lives in Tokyo but often travels to Paris to visit her companies' head offices in the Place Vend√¥me. She occasionally makes visits to her fashion shows. An article in Vogue magazine in April 2017 summarized her relationship with Joffe stating: \\"Joffe, South African by birth and ten years Kawakubo‚Äôs junior, joined the company in 1987. He and Kawakubo married in 1992, at the Paris City Hall. It is a partnership with its own rhythms‚Äîwhile Joffe is based in Paris, his wife lives in Tokyo, in the upscale Aoyama neighborhood, walking distance to CDG‚Äôs flagship. (Kawakubo is reportedly the first one in the office in the morning and the last to leave at night.) When you see them together, he seems to serve as her protector‚Äînot just translating for her, but also shielding her from inquiries deemed too prying.\\" Principal lines *Comme des Gar√ßons *Comme des Gar√ßons Comme des Gar√ßons *Tricot Comme des Gar√ßons *Comme des Gar√ßons Robe De Chambre (discontinued) *Comme des Gar√ßons noir *Comme des Gar√ßons Homme *Comme des Gar√ßons Homme Plus *Comme des Gar√ßons Homme Plus Evergreen *Comme des Gar√ßons Homme Deux *Comme des Gar√ßons Shirt *Play Comme des Gar√ßons *Comme des Gar√ßons Parfums *Comme des Gar√ßons Wallet *Comme des Gar√ßons Play *Comme des Gar√ßons CDG See also *Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Gar√ßons Art of the In-Between Further reading *Deyan Sudjic.

Prior to moving to the North Las Vegas Airport its main bases were McCarran International Airport (LAS), Las Vegas and Henderson Executive Airport (HND), Las Vegas.  History  The airline was established and started operations in 1971. It provided aerial tours of the Grand Canyon. The company's main competitors were Scenic Airlines and Lang Air, which eventually became Vision Airlines. Air Vegas' principal base of operations was originally at McCarran International Airport (LAS). The original fleet consisted of 2 Cessna 207s a Ceasna 337 Sky Master and a Beechcraft A 36 Bonanza. The airline was founded by Sid Petty and his original pilots were Mike Cowan, Clive Bolinger and Mitch LaFortune In the 1980s the airline in flew tours along the old tour route using Cessna 402's and while the owner, Sid Petty, flew a Beech Baron 58 from the (LAS) commuter passenger terminal. This small building was north of the old Hughes Air terminals, on the west side of McCarran. The early- to mid-1980s were the boom years for the Grand Canyon tour business. In 1986, the Grand Canyon tour business was forever changed by an unfortunate mid-air collision between a Grand Canyon Airlines Twin Otter (DHC-6) and a Bell Ranger tour helicopter. An Air Vegas Airlines Cessna 402 After the 1986, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) began research on how it might reduce any future mid-air collisions over the Grand Canyon. The result was the SFAR 50 regulatory environment that now governs Grand Canyon flight operations. Air Vegas, and all of the tour operators eventually formed a \\"Tour Operators Alliance\\" to flight excessive regulation of the Grand Canyon tour business by the federal government. In the 1990s the company made the decision to start using the faster Beechcraft C99 Airliners. Originally, Air Vegas operated under CFR 14, Part 135 as an air taxi operator; eventually, the FAA required the company to change to the more restrictive CFR 14, Part 121 airline rules. This was done to add an additional measure of safety to flight operations. In the early 2000s, the company left its it Henderson base and moved to the North Las Vegas Airport. The company continued to use the Beech 99 aircraft, until airline operations ceased on September 30, 2004, about sixteen months after the death of its founder and owner.  Fleet  The Air Vegas fleet consisted of nine Beechcraft C99 aircraft in September 2004.

Life Ptahhotep was the city administrator and vizier (first minister) during the reign of Pharaoh Djedkare Isesi in the Fifth Dynasty. He is credited with authoring The Maxims of Ptahhotep, an early piece of Egyptian \\"wisdom literature\\" meant to instruct young men in appropriate behavior. He had a son named Akhethetep, who was also a vizier. He and his descendants were buried at Saqqara. However, some believe he was instead buried near the tomb of Cleopatra. Ptahhotep's tomb is located in a mastaba in North Saqqara (Mastaba D62), where he was laid to rest by himself. His grandson Ptahhetep Tshefi, who lived during the reign of Unas, was buried in the mastaba of his father (Mastaba 64).Grimal, p.79 Their tomb is famous for its outstanding depictions.Dieter Arnold, The Encyclopaedia of Ancient Egyptian Architecture, I.B.Tauris 2003, , p.182 Next to the vizier's titles he hold many other important positions, such as overseer of the treasury, overseer of scribes of the king's document, overseer of the double granary and overseer of all royal works. Mastaba His mastaba is located at Saqqara. The entrance is on the South-east and decorated with two pillars. It follows a room with two further rooms on each side. The middle of the complex is occupied by a court with ten pillars. Going further north, several other rooms follow with one containing the false door of Ptahhotep and an offering table in front of it. Most walls of the mastaba are decorated with reliefs, but mostly only the lower parts of the scenes are preserved. They are mainly showing offerings bearers. The only family member preserved in the tomb decoration is the son Akhhotep. The name of the wife is not preserved. The Maxims of Ptahhotep For a long time it was believed by many scholars that Ptahhotep wrote the first book in history. His book was entitled The Maxims of Ptahhotep. As the Vizier, he wrote on a number of topics in his book that were derived from the central concept of Egyptian wisdom and literature which came from the goddess Maat. She was the daughter of the primordial and symbolized both cosmic order and social harmony. Ptahhotep‚Äôs instruction was written as advice to his people in the hopes of maintaining this said \\"social order\\". He wrote perspicacious advice covering topics from table manners and proper conduct for success in court circles to handy hints to the husband for preserving his wife‚Äôs beauty. Ptahhotep also wrote more social instructions such as ways to avoid argumentative persons and cultivate self-control. There are authors who date the Maxims of Ptahhotep much earlier than the 25th century BC. For instance, Pulitzer Prize winning historian Will Durant dates these writings as early as 2880 BC within The Story of Civilization: Our Oriental History, which was published in 1935. Durant claims that Ptahhotep could be considered the very first philosopher in virtue of having the earliest surviving fragments of moral philosophy (i.e., \\"The Maxims of Ptah- Hotep\\"). Ptahhotep's grandson, Ptahhotep Tshefi, is traditionally credited with being the author of the collection of wise sayings known as The Maxims of Ptahhotep,Grimal, p.79. whose opening lines attribute authorship to the vizier Ptahhotep: Instruction of the Mayor of the city, the Vizier Ptahhotep, under the Majesty of King Isesi.M. Lichtheim, Ancient Egyptian Literature, p.61 They take the form of advice and instructions from a father to his son and are said to have been assembled during the late Old Kingdom. However, their oldest surviving copies are written in Middle Egyptian dating to the late First Intermediate Period of the Middle Kingdom.James P. Allen, Middle Egyptian: An Introduction to the Language and Culture of Hieroglyphs, Cambridge University Press 2000, , p.259. That means that the book was more likely composed in the Middle Kingdom and the authorship is fictional. The 1906 translation by Battiscombe Gunn, published as part of the \\"Wisdom of the East\\" series, was made directly from the Prisse papyrus in Paris, rather than from copies, and is still in print.Battiscombe G. Gunn, \\"The Instruction of Ptah-Hotep and the Instruction of Ke'Gemni The Oldest Books in the World\\", London, John Murray, Albemarle Street, 1906, A manuscript copy, the Prisse Papyrus, is on display at the Louvre. Modern influence In the popular 1960 book Initiation, Hungarian author and spiritual teacher, Elisabeth Haich, makes the claim that in a past life she was the disciple and niece of Ptahhotep. Also, in an episode of Quantum Leap called \\"The Curse of Ptah-Hotep\\", Sam Beckett leaps into an archeologist named Dale Conway as he and a colleague uncover the tomb of Ptah-Hotep, although he is incorrectly referred to as a king rather than a vizier.

The band was formed with this lineup from the band Sunnyglade in 2001. History =Sunnyglade to formation of Juli (1996‚Äì2003)= The band was formed under the name Sunnyglade in 1996 as an all-male band, consisting of Andreas \\"Dedi\\" Herde, Martin M√∂ller (drums), Jonas Pfetzing, Marcel R√∂mer and Simon Triebel, who was also the singer. A female lead singer, Miriam Adameit, soon joined the band. With this lineup, they recorded an album called Pictures of My Mind (1998), which sold 500 copies. When Adameit and M√∂ller decided to leave the band in 2000, they were joined by Eva Briegel and Marcel R√∂mer, and the list of band members has not changed since. At that time, the group (still calling itself Sunnyglade) focused on writing and performing songs with English lyrics, and they enjoyed their first major success when they won the Hessischer Rockpreis 2000 and finished second in the Deutscher Pop-Preis contest. After the signing of their first recording contract with EMI in early 2001, Sunnyglade started working on recordings with producer Lutz Fahrenkrog-Petersen. Soon the quintet decided to turn to songs with German lyrics. At this time they also abandoned the name Sunnyglade and all their songs, and renamed themselves Juli, which they chose from the song with the same name by another band from Berlin called Tex. The band's first gigs as Juli took place in June 2002. They recorded their first professional demo in October 2002 with producer Michael Gerlach. Due to the positive feedback of various record labels, their music publisher decided to organize a showcase, which occurred on January 16, 2003, at the Oxymoron in Berlin. Three months later, on April 24 Universal Music organized an \\"Unplugged Showcase\\" for several artists in front of a jury. Singer Eva Briegel and guitarist Jonas Pfetzing contributed four songs in the name of the band. Presumably their record contract was a result of that performance; they got the contract on the recommendation of an A&R; rep who had seen them perform on January 16 and recommended them. In August 2003, four years after they had set that goal, they signed their first recording contract at Popkomm in Cologne. =Es ist Juli (2004‚Äì2005)= In June 2004, Juli release their debut single \\"Perfekte Welle\\", which turned into a kind of anthem for the new rise in popularity of German song lyrics, and also gave its name to a collection of compilations of music with German lyrics (Perfekte Welle - Musik von hier). Though the single debuted at a modest number 38 on the German singles charts and instantly fell out of the top 40 in its second week, the song soon recovered and due to heavy radio airplay and massive CD single sales, \\"Perfekte Welle\\" finally entered the German top 10 in its eleventh week. The song peaked at number 2 four months after release and eventually received a Gold certification. It has sold over 160,000 copies in Germany. However, \\"Perfekte Welle\\" (German for \\"Perfect Wave\\") was the subject of controversy and was banned from radio and TV stations after the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake (see below). The song later became and currently is available for download for Rock Band the video game. The band's critically acclaimed debut album Es ist Juli was released in September 2004 and peaked at #2 in Germany, #4 in Austria and #7 in Switzerland, selling more than 700,000 copies within a few months. By July 2006, it had sold over 1 million copies, and thus reached the status of a quadruple platinum record. Though the album became the fourth most successful album of the year (it stayed and in the German top 25 charts for a complete year) and it spawned another four singles, only \\"Geile Zeit\\", the album's second single, made it into the German Top 20. In 2005, the group represented Hesse in the Bundesvision Song Contest 2005, with the song \\"Geile Zeit\\", placing 1st with 159 points. In July of the same year, Juli participated in the Berlin Live 8 concert. After participating in a radio-tour organized by Eins Live through Nordrhein-Westfalen in September 2004, Juli started their own club tour through Germany, which was completely sold out. After that followed a tour opening for Rosenstolz through Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. After the tsunami disaster in southeast Asia in December 2004, when tidal waves killed more than 280,000 people, most radio stations took \\"Perfekte Welle\\" out of rotation right away, because, according to them, its lyrics had become involuntarily ambiguous and could cause offense. The song is actually about a surfer who is waiting for a wave to ride on, a metaphor for taking chances after long periods of waiting and hoping. Apparently at various radio stations during the first few days after the catastrophe, because of auto rotation, the song popped up right after reports from the affected area, and some of the audience considered this to be deliberate sarcasm. Some fans tried to convince the stations that the song had a positive message and nothing to do with the disaster, but the band and Universal Music showed understanding with the stations. In February 2005, the \\"Es ist Juli\\" tour started, in which the band played many concerts and festival gigs. They spent most of the 2005 on tour. They also participated in the Live 8 concert in Berlin, where they performed the songs \\"Geile Zeit\\" and \\"Perfekte Welle\\". At that time three more singles were released: \\"Regen und Meer\\", \\"Warum\\", and \\"November\\", but none had the same success as their predecessor. The video of \\"Regen und Meer\\" got some attention in the media, because the band was playing the part of a terrorist group from 1977 and referred directly to the Red Army Faction (RAF) and the abduction and murder of Hanns-Martin Schleyer. =Ein neuer Tag (2006‚Äì2009)= Eva Briegel live on the Ein neuer Tag tour. From third quarter 2005 onwards, the band made very few official appearances, choosing instead to retreat to Bochum to work on their second studio album. The band decided to keep the overall tone of the album quieter and more mature than their previous one. During 2006 they played mainly in festivals, such as the Schlossgrabenfest, Donauinselfest, and the Soundgarden Festival. In July 2006, the new album was finally completed. The time before the release of the album Ein neuer Tag (A New Day) was filled with PR work. On September 22, 2006, the first single of the album \\"Dieses Leben\\" was released, and it hit the top 5 single charts right away. On October 13, Ein neuer Tag finally hit the album charts. It sold 75,000 copies within the first week and reached position 18 in the World United Album Charts, and with more than 200,000 pre-orders, it had already reached platinum status by the release date. On November 30, 2006, Juli won the German Bambi-award in the category music national, and on December 7, 2006, they were awarded the Eins- Live-Krone, Germany's most important radio listener award. After the release of \\"Wir Beide\\", the second single from the album, Juli started touring to support Ein neuer Tag. Some of the concerts sold out weeks in advance or had to be moved into larger venues. After playing in festivals in summer, they will start the second leg of their tour in autumn. Originally they had planned \\"Am Besten sein\\" to be their next single, which was to be released in January 2007. However, the third single finally was \\"Zerrissen\\". On 7 July 2007 Juli performed at the German leg of Live Earth in Hamburg. In April 2007, the song Stolen by Dashboard Confessional was rerecorded as a duet between lead singer Eva Briegel and Chris Carrabba and released on 27 July 2007. In September 2007, there were a couple of new releases. On 21 September, the song \\"Ein neuer Tag\\" from the album of the same name was released. One week later, on 28 September, a live DVD and a live album was released, both with the name \\"Ein neuer Tag - live\\". Juli do not see themselves as a rock band, but call their own music style \\"alternative pop\\". They put high expectations into their lyrics and are always trying to reach more of an adult audience rather than teenagers. Juli are one of Germany's most-played bands on the radio; their first three singles (\\"Perfekte Welle\\", \\"Geile Zeit\\", and \\"Regen und Meer\\") all reached the top of Germany's airplay charts and all remained in the Top 10 for several months. \\"Dieses Leben\\" also repeated this success. It remained number one for five consecutive weeks. They also managed to reach the top 5 with their current single. =In Love and Insel (2010‚Äìpresent)= The last tour concerts for the album Ein Neuer Tag took place in late 2007. Following these, Juli announced that they would take a break from music. Around one year later, they published pictures and videos of their recording studio on Myspace.http://www.myspace.com/esistjuli In September 2010 they released their third studio album, In Love. \\"Elektrisches Gef√ºhl\\" (Electrical Feeling) was released as the album's first single, reaching number 12 in the German Singles Chart. It debuted on radio in July 2010 and was released on 27 August 2010. Second single \\"Immer wenn es dunkel wird\\" (Whenever it is dark) was released later in 2010 and charted at number 37 in Germany. In September 2013 Juli announced on their facebook page that they are working on a new album. On 13 June 2014 the band made an appearance at Kieler Woche and played two new songs, including the first Single Insel (Island) which was released as a download on 12 September 2014. The second single Jetzt (Now) was released on 19 September 2014, the third single Eines Tages (Someday) followed on 26 September 2014. Both were, like the first single, released exclusively as a download. The album Insel was released on 3 October 2014 as a download and on CD. It reached number 10 in the German charts and thus the lowest placement of all Juli albums. Relationships to other bands At the same time as Juli started out with their success, there were a couple of other bands with German lyrics who experienced a breakthrough. Just before Juli rose to fame, the bands Wir sind Helden (first release in 2003) and Silbermond (first release in March 2004) for example, celebrated their first success. The fact that all 3 of those bands appear with a female singer and German lyrics got them a lot of attention at first. From the start of their career they had to face such comparisons, which they strictly disclaimed. One thing that is clearly missed out in that case is that all three bands were already writing German songs, and played with the same line up before their first recording contract. In particular Silbermond, whose career started out similar to Juli's as a student band singing English songs, they are frequently compared to Wir Sind Helden by the media, which both bands consider nonsense. Juli have recently appeared in a Dashboard Confessional music video where lead singer Eva Briegel also sang.

In addition to publication of the magazine, the magazine was associated with its own record label, Flipside Records, releasing vinyl records and compact discs beginning in 1978. As one of the first and longest running U.S. punk rock fanzines, Flipside chronicled the independent and underground music scene. Known for its highly opinionated cast of writers, Flipside evolved from a photocopied fanzine to a magazine produced by web offset printing and featuring glossy covers. Publication history Los Angeles Flipside Fanzine was launched in 1977 in Whittier, California by five Whittier High School friends, Pooch, Larry Lash, Tory, X-8 and editor and publisher Al Kowalewski. The initial issues of the publication were produced by means of a photocopy machine, with Kowalewski's first modest goal set at selling 1,000 copies per issue. Beginning with a tiny local distribution in a few Los Angeles area record stores, within two years the publication had grown sufficiently to support sheet-fed offset printing on heavy white stock for production, with sales tallied in 12 American states and four countries. Later issues were produced on newsprint via a high speed web press and included a glossy magazine cover. From 1979 until 1989, the fanzine was co-owned and co-edited by Hudley \\"Hud\\" Flipside, a pseudonym of Holly Duval Cornell. By the magazine's sixth anniversary in the summer of 1983, the press run had grown to 6,500 for America, with an additional printing in Germany for European distribution. Flipside fanzine put on a Burning Man-style festival in California's Mojave Desert at a location known as Jawbone Canyon for several years during the mid-1990s. It was much smaller and more localized than the actual Burning Man festivals and often featured bands that Flipside released on their own label. Special guests included Fugazi, The Offspring and Hawkwind's Nik Turner. Flipside published a special 10-year anniversary issue titled \\"Los Angeles Flipside Fanzine Issue 5,\\" documenting the first ten years of punk rock from 1977 to 1987 with 224 pages of band interviews. Flipside Records For several years, the publishers also produced punk rock records under the label name Flipside Records. Inspired by the ability of small local labels such as Dangerhouse Records and Slash Records, Kowalewski and Peter Landswick launched the Flipside label in 1978. In 1979, Kowalewski recalled his own experiences in an effort to inspire additional DIY labels: > \\"...So anyway me and Pete were eating a pizza one day and Pete said, 'Ya > know, Al, we oughta start a record company. We though about it a while and > we decided that if Dangerhouse could put out records and if Chris Ashford > could put out records and if Slash could put out records, then we could put > out records, too.... In the next four months we (mostly Pete, he's the > president of Flipside Records) found out all about putting out a private > single. We found out about mastering and labels and pressing and acetates > and waiting and sleeves and waiting and now we know all there is to know.... > The moral of this story is 'If we can do it, you can do it.' So everybody > release your own singles!\\" Bands on the roster included Detox, Doggy Style, Bulimia Banquet, Anti-Scrunti Faction, Babyland, Sluts for Hire, Popdefect, Paper Tulips, and Sandy Duncan's Eye. Flipside Records released Vinyl - 12\\" compilations, Vol. 1, 2, and 3. Included on the vinyl compilations are a variety of punk bands from GBH to Cheetah Chrome and the Motherfuckers. Each vinyl compilation included a bands and lyrics insert. Similar to an issue of Flipside Fanzine yet designed as a newspaper. All inserts were designed by Hudley. The first Beck recordings: a split 7\\" with the band Bean and the full-length CD Stereopathetic Soulmanure was also released on Flipside Records. Rodney on the ROQ Volume 1 - 3  Los Angeles Flipside Fanzine worked on the Rodney on the ROQ compilation album projects with Posh Boy Records and Rodney Bingenheimer. The album‚Äôs inserts were issues of Los Angeles Flipside Fanzine. Each insert includes the bands of each volume (music tracks and lyrics) including pictures and interviews gathered by Flipside. Rodney on the ROQ included Flipside Fanzine insert Issue 21 (December 1980). Rodney on the ROQ Volume 2 included Flipside Fanzine Issue 28 (November 1981). Rodney on the ROQ Vol III included Flipside Fanzine Issue 35 (December 82). This was a strategic time for a radio personality, a record label and a fanzine to work together to support and promote a growing musical underground and exclusive punk scene. Bingenheimer was also responsible for three Rodney on the ROQ compilation albums as well as the compact disc and later digital download compendium, \\"The Best of Rodney on the ROQ\\" on Posh Boy Records. Flipside Video Los Angeles Flipside Video is a project created by Al, Gus and Hudley. Gus took some classes at a local Jr. College, Rio Hondo, and thus began our journey of live recordings. Cameras, editing equipment and mail order was all done in house at the Flipside office. Video 1 through 10 included many of the bands interviewed in Flipside Fanzine for example; Social Distortion, Big Boys, 100 Flowers, Toy Dolls, Pillsbury Hardcore , The Adolescents, Entropy, Final Conflict, The Dicks, Corrosion of Conformity. A special video was dedicated to GBH (band) called Brit Boys Attacked by Brats . All videos were taped live at many of the clubs and venues that were popular at the time. Key personnel The editors and staff writers contributing to Los Angeles Flipside Fanzine were jokingly referred to as the \\"Staph,\\" particularly during the fanzine's earlier years. It has been written that KROQ success was due to its renegade roots, and willingness to experiment, which came along at the same time of the birth of the punk and new wave. This is reflected in the songs it made famous. In the same vein, Flipside, and its writers helped promote the punk rock scene globally, and became part of the scene themselves.

As CEO of Sun As CEO of Sun, he dramatically amplified Sun's historically tepid embrace of open source and freely distributed software, attempting to drive adoption, in particular, of Sun's operating system, Solaris. Sun's historic decision to abandon Solaris on Intel compatible x86 computers, he stated in subsequent interviews and blog postings, had entirely undermined the hardware platforms on which Sun depended for revenue - hardware systems that ran only Sun's Solaris. Sun's stock reached a high of $26.25 in 2007, a point just prior to which private equity investors KKR invested $750m dollars in a convertible debt financing. Toward the end of 2007, with nearly a third of its revenue derived from financial services companies, the global financial crisis hit Sun especially hard. With large customers going bankrupt across the world, Schwartz began looking for a buyer for Sun, apparently contravening the wishes of Sun's founder and chairman, Scott McNealy, and stirring resentment among employees. Schwartz ultimately finalized an acquisition, signing an agreement for the sale of the company to Oracle Corporation on April 20, 2009. Oracle had been Sun's largest ISV, and the price of its database was typically a multiple of the price of the Sun hardware on which it ran. Thus, Oracle had the ability, by modifying its pricing, to determine which hardware vendors were chosen. After the acquisition, Oracle dropped the pricing of its database on Sun hardware, in an attempt to boost its performance. As CEO of Sun, Schwartz was known as one of the few Fortune 500 CEOs to use a blog for public communications. He was recognized for his efforts to bring greater transparency into the corporate world, and managed a public exchange with SEC Chairman Christopher Cox about the use of websites and blogs for the dissemination of financial information to meet Regulation Fair Disclosure. Schwartz generally believed the internet, and Sun's web presence on it, was a far more fair and efficient vehicle for the dissemination of Sun's financial information‚Äîas opposed to the expensive, and proprietary networks fostered by ratings agencies and the Wall Street Journal. Post-Sun On February 4, 2010, Schwartz resigned from his post as CEO of Sun. His resignation was a haiku on Twitter that read as follows: \\"Financial crisis/Stalled too many customers/CEO no more.\\"Sun‚Äôs Chief Executive Tweets His Resignation, blogs.nytimes.com, February 4, 2010. On August 12, 2010, Schwartz was named to Taleo Corporation's board of directors. On September 9, 2010 he announced founding a new company, Picture of Health, which later became CareZone. On April 7, 2011, Schwartz was named to Silver Spring Networks's board of directors. In May, 2012, he was appointed to Verifone's board of directors. CareZone San Francisco-based CareZone officially launched February 15, 2012.Quentin Hardy, CareZone, An Anti Facebook, NYTimes Technology, November 13, 2012; retrieved December 21, 2012. CareZone enables users to create a password-protected, centralized repository of information related to the care of children, parents or loved ones. The site serves as a private place to get organized, and privately collaborate with the individuals (family and helpers) that typically surround a loved one being cared for Users can author journals, organize personal information, store documents, and share access to a tightly controlled group of individuals. Schwartz said he started CareZone for people like himself who must simultaneously care for children and parents but find social networking sites to be inappropriate (owing to lax privacy or business models predicated on selling private information), and insufficiently targeted toward the act of caring for family members. Schwartz developed CareZone with Apple and Microsoft veteran Walter Smith. Ideology Schwartz has been an outspoken evangelist for technology as a social utility‚Äîcomparable to electricity or railroads‚Äîthat creates an opportunity to drive economic, political and societal progress.Video Highlights from the 49th Annual McKinsey Awards , discussionleader.hbsp.com; accessed February 12, 2017. He has been a consistent advocate in the halls of the United States Congress as well as globally for regulations that protect the ability of individuals to maintain rights on par with corporations in the protection and promotion of privacy, free speech and intellectual property.

Based on the sport of American football, the game puts the player in control of a football team in modes such as tournament play and sudden death. It was officially endorsed by John Madden. The game's Sega Genesis version was developed by Blue Sky Productions, which was simultaneously creating Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss. John Madden Football '93 adds new animations and features, and it allows players to play as and against famous teams such as the Oakland Raiders of 1976. Aside from Madden Football 64, the game was the last in the Madden franchise to lack the NFL license, which was featured in Madden NFL '94 onward. With over one million units in sales, John Madden Football '93 was a commercial success. Critics awarded the game high scores and praised its updated graphics; but several reviewers complained that little had changed since John Madden Football '92. Royalties from the game funded the expansion of Blue Sky Productions, and the company's director, Paul Neurath, later commented that the size of these royalties led Electronic Arts to develop future Madden titles in-house. Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy ports of the game were licensed and developed by UBI Soft but were cancelled. Gameplay The player selects a play. The timer for the quarter is on the right of the screen, while the current down and remaining yards are near the bottom. John Madden Football '93 is an adaptation of American football that takes place from an isometric perspective in a two-dimensional environment. The player begins each match by selecting such variables as the game mode, weather conditions and team(s). Game modes include pre-season, regular season, playoffs, and sudden death. In addition to the game's single- player mode, two-player competitive and cooperative modes are available. Unlike in prior games in the series, a coin toss at the beginning of every match determines which team will kick off, and which team will defend each goal. Before every down, the player selects a personnel grouping, formation, play and, on defense, coverage shell from a menu. The game contains fifty-five offensive plays and seventy-one defensive plays, such as screen and play- action passes, blitzes and man-to-man defense. During a down, the player may control one team member at a time or allow the entire team to execute a play automatically. On offense, depending on the play, the player controls the quarterback, running back or kicker. After a pass, control automatically changes to the ball receiver. On defense, the player may at any time switch control between any members of the team. Instant replay is available to review plays. New features in John Madden Football '93 include no-huddle offense, overturning certain calls made by referees, taunting, stumbling, head-butting and one-handed catches. As with its predecessors, the game features updated statistics for the twenty-eight NFL teams in the game, based on their performance in the previous season. In addition to these teams, eight famous team line-ups, such as the Oakland Raiders of 1976 and the Dallas Cowboys of 1977, are available. An \\"All-Madden Greats\\" team is compiled from the best players in the history of the sport and an \\"All-Madden\\" team is compiled of recent standout players. No official player or team names, colors, or stadium names are used. A special version of the game for the Sega Genesis, titled John Madden Football: Championship Edition, was initially released as a rental-only game before it was later re-released exclusively via direct mail. This version of the game uses only \\"championship caliber\\" line-ups from the 1966-1991 era. Although it still lacks official names, this version features correct team colors. Development John Madden Football '93 was developed for the Sega Genesis by Blue Sky Productions (credited as \\"Looking Glass Technology\\"), which was simultaneously working on Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss. The game was not a port, but was rather an original work by the company. They were approached by Electronic Arts soon after production on Ultima Underworld began, an event that company head Paul Neurath later attributed to contacts he had within the publisher, thanks to his involvement with the Electronic Arts project Chuck Yeager's Advanced Flight Trainer. Neurath said that Electronic Arts was dissatisfied with the work that another studio had been doing on John Madden Football '93, and that the publisher was \\"scrambling to find a [replacement] team\\" to meet the game's rapidly approaching deadline. Blue Sky received the source code of John Madden Football '92 and had to develop a sequel in five months. Neurath later said that development was \\"part out-of-house and part in-house\\". The game's visuals were made by Doug Wike, who also created graphics for Ultima Underworld. In 1991, Neurath contracted the outside programmer Mark Lesser, who had previously worked on Mean 18, to develop the game's technical aspects. According to Lesser, this was necessary because none of Blue Sky's employees had experience programming for the Sega Genesis. Neurath believed that Blue Sky introduced \\"some nice improvements\\" to the franchise. A preview in Mega noted that the game had \\"a lot of added animation\\" compared to its predecessors. A writer for Mega Drive Advanced Gaming believed that \\"the most obvious addition is the digitised speech\\", which did not appear in the game's Super NES version. In its November 1992 issue, Electronic Gaming Monthly estimated that the game was \\"100% complete\\". The game's Genesis and SNES versions were released at the same time. As with earlier John Madden Football titles, John Madden Football '93 lacks the NFL license, which prevented the inclusion of official teams, colors, player names and stadiums. Sega's competing title, the Joe Montana-endorsed NFL Sports Talk Football '93, had received the license that year. Reception John Madden Football '93 was a commercial success, with over one million copies sold. It has been cited as the highest-selling game developed by Looking Glass Studios, and Neurath later called it \\"one of the most successful games I've ever worked on\\". Paul Mellerick of Mega commented that \\"the only noticeable difference between [John Madden Football '93] and its two predecessors is the animation\\". He wrote that this new animation \\"makes the game incredibly good to look at\\" and that new motions like stumbling increase the game's difficulty. Although he believed that the \\"two-player mode is just as exciting as ever\\", he was disappointed by the lack of a full-season mode, which he called \\"unforgivable\\" in light of this feature's appearance in Sega's NFL Sports Talk Football '93. He concluded that John Madden Football '93 was \\"the best game the Mega Drive has to offer\\", but he wrote, \\"If you own John Madden Football '92, or even the original John Madden American Football for that matter, then you should ignore this game completely\\". A writer for GamePro noted that John Madden Football '93 was \\"at first glance\\" largely identical to its predecessor; but he believed that, \\"once you get down to serious business, you'll notice a wealth of All-Star enhancements\\". He wrote that the \\"game play is now faster and smoother\\", and that \\"the graphics are sharper, more detailed, and even better animated\\". He believed that \\"Electronic Arts has [...] made the best even better\\", and he concluded, \\"John Madden Football '93 is even more fun to play than Madden '92\\". The staff of Mean Machines Sega called the game \\"hopelessly redundant\\" and \\"very, very disappoint[ing]\\", and they believed that the John Madden Football series was \\"on its last legs\\". They considered the game to be arguably worse than its predecessors, largely because of framerate problems. The reviewers concluded that it was \\"not a bad game at all\\", but they suggested that readers buy \\"the slightly better John Madden Football '92 if [they are] after the definitive American Football game\\". Reviewing the SNES version of John Madden Football '93, a GamePro writer believed that it was \\"a major improvement\\" over the previous SNES John Madden Football title. He wrote that the game's visuals were the biggest leap, particularly after the \\"slow and chunky\\" graphics of the earlier release. He enjoyed its sound effects, but he noted the lack of voice clips present in the Genesis version. He concluded that the series was now roughly even across the two consoles, and he wrote that the game was \\"a strong candidate for SNES Sports Cart of the Year\\". A writer for Nintendo Power wrote, \\"Madden '93 is easy to play and has the feel of the real game\\". He believed that the most noticeable additions were the new teams and \\"new play options\\", although he found it \\"awkward\\" to select plays. He finished, \\"Really the only thing missing is an option to play an entire season\\". Carl Rowley of N-Force called the visuals \\"sharper than ever\\" and believed that the character sprites were \\"small but well defined\\". He found that the game played \\"brilliantly\\", and he praised the instant replay feature as \\"superb\\" and \\"amazing\\". He wrote that his \\"only niggle is the lack of sampled speech\\", which he considered to be \\"a bit of a let down\\". Finishing his review, Rowley wrote that the game was the \\"best American football game available\\". =Legacy= After the game's development concluded, programmer Mark Lesser was contracted by Electronic Arts to work on NHL '94, a series that he remained on \\"for many years\\". Neurath said that the royalties Blue Sky received from John Madden Football '93 \\"were quite substantial\\", and that \\"it was really the royalties of Madden more than anything else [...] that allowed us to grow the [company]\\". Neurath believed that the size of these royalties led Electronic Arts to develop future Madden games in-house, in order to maximize profit. Aside from Madden Football 64, John Madden Football '93 was the last game in the Madden franchise to lack the NFL license, which the series first obtained with Madden NFL '94. In 2012, Michael Rundle wrote in The Huffington Post that John Madden Football '93 \\"really set the bar\\" for the franchise, and he believed that its gameplay was superior to that of Madden NFL 13.

He was president of Brown University and pastor of the First Baptist Church in America in Providence, Rhode Island. In Washington, D.C., Wayland Seminary was established in 1867, primarily to educate former slaves, and was named in his honor. (In 1899, Wayland Seminary merged with another school to become the current Virginia Union University, at Richmond, Virginia.) Early Life and Family Francis Wayland's father was an Englishman of the same name, who was also a Baptist pastor. Born in New York City in 1796, Wayland graduated from Union College in 1813 and studied medicine in Troy, under Dr. Ely Burritt. Dr. Burritt, a son of the Rev. Blackleach Burritt, graduated from Williams College, class of 1800 and was licensed to practice medicine at Troy, New York, on March 29, 1802, and quickly gained recognition for his medical skills. Dr. Wayland said the following about his former teacher: \\"Dr. Ely Burritt was a man of remarkable logical powers of enthusiastic love of his profession, and of great and deserved confidence in his own judgment. He stood at the head of his profession in Troy, and in the neighboring region, and was a person of high moral character.\\" Dr. Wayland also studied medicine in New York City, but in 1816 entered Andover Theological Seminary, where he was greatly influenced by Moses Stuart. He was too poor to conclude his course in theology, and in 1817-1821 was a tutor at Union College, to which, after five years as pastor of the First Baptist Church of Boston, he returned in 1826 as professor of natural philosophy. He was one of the founders of Newton Theological Institution in 1825.Hovey, Alvah, Historical Address Delivered at the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Newton Theological Institution, June 8, 1875 (Boston, 1875), p. 9. He was an early advocate of the temperance and anti- slavery causes, for many years was \\"inspector of the state prison and Providence county jail,\\" president of the Prison Discipline Society, and active in prison reform and local charities. He was one of the \\"law and order\\" leaders during the \\"Dorr Rebellion\\" of 1842, and was called \\"the first citizen of Rhode Island.\\" One of the individuals that he supported, trained and encouraged was Leonard Black, author of The Life and Sufferings of Leonard Black, a Fugitive from Slavery who became a Baptist minister.The Life and Sufferings of Leonard Black, a Fugitive from Slavery. Written by Himself. New Bedford: Benjamin Lindsey, 1847. Wayland worked hard to prevent the local Baptist denominations from splitting into pro-slavery and anti-slavery factions, but ultimately failed in this attempt. Wayland was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1851.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory Brown Presidency In 1827 he became president of Brown University. In the twenty-eight years of his administration he gradually built up the college, improving academic discipline, formed a library and gave scientific studies a more prominent place. He also worked for higher educational ideals outside the college, writing text-books on ethics and economics, and promoting the free school system of Rhode Island and especially (1828) of Providence. His Thoughts on the Present Collegiate System in the United States (1842) and his Report to the Corporation of Brown University of 1850 pointed the way to educational reforms, particularly the introduction of industrial courses, which were only partially adopted in his lifetime. Wayland's attempts to reform Brown's medical school were met with antagonism and resistance from the school's faculty and staff to the point where they resigned, and the medical program was eliminated. Wayland was vividly remembered by members of the Brown community, including Charles T. Congdon and James B. Angell, who are quoted in the Encyclopedia Brunoniana. Charles T. Congdon wrote in his Reminiscences: > He was disobeyed with fear and trembling, and the boldest did not care to > encounter his frown. He was majestic in manner, and could assume, if he > pleased, a Rhadamanthine severity. It was a calamity to be called into that > awful presence; and no student, of whatever character, ever made the least > pretence of not being frightened at the summons. ... However loosely our > tongues might wag, we thoroughly respected and even reverenced the > president; and upon public occasions, when he put on his academic gown and > cap, we were rather proud of his imposing appearance. ... In his later days, > I have been told he exhibited marked urbanity and sweetness of disposition. > Certainly there were small traces of either when any undergraduate was > detected in an act of meanness or a flagrant violation of the university > statutes. He had a heavy foot for a student‚Äôs door when it was not promptly > opened after his official knock. President of the University of Michigan James B. Angell Class of 1849, who wrote in Memories of Brown: > The discipline of the college was wholly in his hands. In administering it > he was stern, at times imperious. But no graduate of his time ever failed to > gain from him higher ideals of duty or lasting impulses to a noble and > strenuous life. He said so many wise things to us and uttered them in so > pithy and sententious a style that one could never forget them. I presume > that my experience is like that of others, when I say that hardly a week of > my life has passed in which I have not recalled some of his apt sayings and > to my great advantage. Is there any better proof than that of the power of a > teacher over his pupils? He resigned the presidency of Brown in 1855, and served from 1857 to 1858 as pastor of the historic First Baptist Church in America, in Providence. Role in the development of public libraries Wayland was a long time vocal advocate for libraries. His donation to the town of Wayland, Massachusetts, in 1851 for the establishment of a public library was the catalyst for legislation in Massachusetts allowing towns to establish libraries. Published work Besides several volumes of sermons and addresses and the volumes already mentioned, he published: * (repeatedly revised and translated into foreign languages) * in which he advocated free trade [a debate with Rev. Richard Fuller of South Carolina] * Harriet Ware founded the Children's Friend Society Adoniram Judson was a missionary to Burma *Elements of Intellectual Philosophy (1854) *Notes on the Principles and Practices of Baptist Churches (1857) *Letters on the Ministry of the Gospel (1863) *a brief Memoir of Thomas Chalmers (1864).The Life and Labors of Francis Wayland (2 vols, New York, 1867) by his sons Francis and Heman Lincoln; the shorter sketch (Boston, 1891) by James O Murray in the \\"American Religious Leaders\\" series; and an article by GC Verplanck in vol. xiv. of the American Journal of Education. Other works:    Legacy The town of Wayland, Massachusetts was named in his honor. Wayland Seminary in Washington D.C., a predecessor of Virginia Union University was named for him.

Thai houses usually feature a bamboo or wooden structure, raised on stilts and topped with a steep gabled roof. The houses from each of Thailand's regions have distinctive styles, which reflect the people's living style, including social and cultural beliefs or religious customs and occupations. Construction The traditional Thai house at King Rama II Memorial Park Using renewable natural materials including timber and bamboo, the dwellings are often built without the use of metal including nails.

The long overhanging eaves can protect from sun or rain. The wide terrace outside the house is suitable for summer use.

The additional part has three styles: a style with a roof overlapping a rice storage building, a style which is separated from the main house with all stilts buried into the soil and a style which is built with a middle pole which stops at the beam and is not attached to the soil. The last type is a \\"permanent house\\", which has three styles: overlap house, twin style house, and single house. All stilt houses had a few narrow windows and only one door in the front, then the inside was darker than the other stilt houses.

KALEA house, an ancient style of LAN-NA people which is decorated by a cross of wood in a V or X shape at the top front. The other roof type is known as ‚Äúwind spaces house‚Äù and the structure was influenced from the central region with a high roof with the halo of the sun in the middle of a gabled roof and the roof tiles are made from baked clay in a fish scale pattern. The last type is a ‚Äúmiddle period house‚Äù from the period of RAMA 5, and was improved from a basic LAN-NA house, with more complicated layers on the roof and more holes in the walls to make the doors and windows. It is decorated by using stained wood, an influence from western countries that traded with Thailand at that time, such as France or England. *Notable contemporary examples: **Ban Dongphayom =Southern Thai traditional house style= There are three types of southern stilt houses, RUEN KHRUENG PHOOK (Meeting house with rope),Pattaya location beach front.

The defining characteristics of the stilt houses of the southern region are the structure of the roof and the stilts on cement poles. The weather of the south of Thailand always rainy with many typhoons, so the house must be stronger than in the other regions. The structure of the southern stilt house is also unique. The walls are made from layers of wood boards, the windows are narrow, using mortise and tension joint instead of the nails, and it has a lower gable roof than other regions. There are three roof styles that were influenced by other countries. Firstly, the gable roof follows the basic style. The tiles are made of grass, baked clay, or rhomboid tiles depend on the status of the owner. The roof will be decorated with carved wood if the owner is of high status. The second style, PANYA or LIMA roof was influenced by Indonesian and Malaysian design.Pattaya location beach front. The traditional Thai house.

Originally based on existing Native American foot trails winding their way through river valleys, the Siskiyou Trail provided the shortest practical travel path between early settlements in California and Oregon. Development The earliest European or American visitors along the Siskiyou Trail were likely hunters and trappers connected with the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) who, in the 1820s, began to travel the rivers of Southern Oregon and Northern California in search of fur and pelts. The HBC had established itself on the Columbia River, and built Fort Vancouver, its regional headquarters in 1824. HBC parties began to explore south toward California in 1825. Alexander McLeod led exploration and trapping parties south beginning in 1826, reaching the Klamath River in 1827, and the Sacramento River in 1828. In 1829 he led the first HBC trapping expedition to the Sacramento Valley, which allowed later expeditions to reach as far south as French Camp near today's Stockton. McLeod's exploring and trapping expeditions essentially established the Siskiyou Trail, linking Fort Vancouver with the Sacramento Valley. At first it was known by names such as the California Brigade Trail and the Southern Party Trail. McLeod and other members of his parties reported that the Native Americans south of the Umpqua River, along the Klamath and Siuslaw Rivers, had never seen white men before. Although the 42nd parallel (today the boundary between California and Oregon) marked the northern border of Mexican California, the Mexicans knew little about the interior and the HBC trappers ranged south at will. Other HBC trappers who made early use of the Siskiyou Trail include Peter Skene Ogden and Michel Laframboise. In 1834, Ewing Young brought a herd of horses and mules over the Siskiyou Trail from missions in California for sale at British and American settlements in Oregon. Although this initial effort was met with suspicion by Hudson's Bay Company officials in Oregon, Young returned to California in 1837, where he purchased 700 head of cattle which he drove over the Siskiyou Trail to Oregon. This monumental task, requiring nearly three months, helped widen and establish the trail thereby solidifying the new American settlements in Oregon. In 1841, an overland party of the United States Exploring Expedition came down the Siskiyou Trail with the first scientists and cartographers in the region. The California Gold Rush, beginning in 1848, ushered in dramatically increased use of the Siskiyou Trail. The discovery of gold in Siskiyou County in 1851, and especially at Yreka, California, brought thousands more miners along the trail in search of riches. The terrain was so rugged over the mountains of the trail that travel was restricted to mule trains and horses. Early travelers were able to travel perhaps in a day, stopping at wayside inns and hostels, such as at Portuguese Flat, Upper Soda Springs and Sisson, in Northern California. It was not until the 1860s that toll roads usable by stagecoaches were finally carved through the mountains of Northern California, permitting uninterrupted stagecoach travel for the length of the Siskiyou Trail. The first telegraph line connected early towns along the trail in 1864. Development accelerated with the arrival of the Central Pacific Railroad track completed in 1887, which followed the path of the Siskiyou Trail. Route The historic route of the Siskiyou Trail extended from the Columbia District headquarters of the Hudson's Bay Company, at Fort Vancouver in southern Washington, to the San Francisco Bay Area. In California the trail went through or near modern-day Redding, Dunsmuir and Yreka. In Oregon the route went through or near modern- day Ashland, Grants Pass, Roseburg, Eugene, Salem and Portland. The trail used the valleys of the Willamette, Umpqua, Rogue, Klamath, Shasta and Sacramento rivers to make the connection between Oregon and California, and to traverse the rugged mountains of Northern California and Southern Oregon (Siskiyou Mountains). The trail crested at the Siskiyou Summit (elevation ) just north of the Oregon-California border, and went past or near landmarks such as Mount Shasta, Upper Soda Springs, Castle Crags and Sutter Buttes. Modern roads Between 1869 and 1887, the Oregon & California Railroad Company built a railroad along this route, crossing Siskiyou Summit in 1887. In the mid-1910s, the pioneering Pacific Highway, later numbered as U.S. Highway 99, provided the first easy automobile access along the path of the trail. Interstate 5 was built in the 1960s along the route of the original 1820s Siskiyou Trail. About 4 miles (7 km) north of the California border, and just south of Ashland, Oregon, the highway crosses Siskiyou Summit, the highest point on I-5 (elevation ). The railroad and interstate highway deviate from the original trail in small ways according to the needs and engineering available to their builders.

A warrant of attorney was a security for money in the form of an authority to a solicitor named by a creditor, empowering him to sign judgment in an action against the debtor for the sum due, with a defeasance‚Äîa clause that the warrant shall not be put into force in case of due payment of the money secured. It was often used as a collateral security, either for the payment of an annuity or with mortgages, in order that the mortgagee, by entering up judgment, might obtain priority in the administration of the assets of the mortgagor. The Debtors Act 1869 contained various provisions for making known to the debtor the extent of the liability incurred by him, among others that the warrant must be executed in the presence of a solicitor named by the debtor, and that it and the defeasance must be written on the same paper.

It may also be used for essential tremors. The dose may be based on levels measured in the blood. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include sleepiness, poor coordination, nausea, and loss of appetite. Severe side effects may include suicide, psychosis, a lack of blood cells. Use during pregnancy may result in harm to the baby. Primidone is an anticonvulsant of the barbiturate class. How it works is not entirely clear. Primidone was approved for medical use in the United States in 1954. It is available as a generic medication. A month supply in the United Kingdom costs the NHS about 68.40 ¬£ as of 2019. In the United States the wholesale cost of this amount is about US$13.20. In 2017, it was the 238th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than two million prescriptions. Medical uses =Epilepsy= Licensed for generalized tonic-clonic and complex partial seizures in the United Kingdom. In the United States, primidone is approved for adjunctive (in combination with other drugs) and monotherapy (by itself) use in generalized tonic-clonic seizures, simple partial seizures, and complex partial seizures, and myoclonic seizures. In juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), it is a second-line therapy, reserved for when the valproates or lamotrigine do not work and when other second-line therapies--acetazolamide work either. Open-label case series have suggested that primidone is effective in the treatment of epilepsy. Primidone has been compared to phenytoin, phenobarbital, mephobarbital, ethotoin, metharbital, and mephenytoin. In adult comparison trials, primidone has been found to be just as effective. =Essential tremor= Primidone is considered to be a first-line therapy for essential tremor along with propranolol. In terms of tremor amplitude reduction, it is just as effective as propranolol, reducing it by 50%. Both drugs are well studied for this condition, unlike other therapies, and are recommended for initial treatment. 250 mg/day (low- dose therapy) is just as good as 750 mg/day (high-dose therapy). Primidone is not the only anticonvulsant used for essential tremor; the others include topiramate and gabapentin. Other pharmacological agents include alprazolam, clonazepam, atenolol, sotalol, nadolol, clozapine, nimodipine, and botulinum toxin A. Many of these drugs were less effective (according to Table 1), but a few were not. Only propranolol has been compared to primidone in a clinical trial. =Psychiatric disorders= In 1965, Monroe and Wise reported using primidone along with a phenothiazine derivative antipsychotic and chlordiazepoxide in treatment-resistant psychosis. What is known is that ten years later, Monroe went on to publish the results of a meta-analysis of two controlled clinical trials on people displaying out-of-character and situationally inappropriate aggression, who had abnormal EEG readings, and who responded poorly to antipsychotics; one of the studies was specifically mentioned as involving psychosis patients. When they were given various anticonvulsants not only did their EEGs improve, but so did the aggression. In March 1993, S.G. Hayes of the University of Southern California School of Medicine reported that nine out of twenty-seven people (33%) with either treatment-resistant depression or treatment-resistant bipolar disorder had a permanent positive response to primidone. A plurality of subjects were also given methylphenobarbital in addition to or instead of primidone. Adverse effects Primidone can cause drowsiness, listlessness, ataxia, visual disturbances, nystagmus, headache, and dizziness. These side effects are the most common, occurring in more than 1% of users. Transient nausea and vomiting are also common side effects. Dupuytren's contracture of the fourth digit (ring finger). Dupuytren's contracture, a disease of the fasciae in the palm and fingers that permanently bends the fingers (usually the little and ring fingers) toward the palm, was first noted to be highly prevalent in epileptic people in 1941 by a Dr. Lund, fourteen years before primidone was on the market. Lund also noted that it was equally prevalent in individuals with idiopathic and symptomatic epilepsy and that the severity of the epilepsy did not matter. However, only one quarter of the women were affected vs. half of the men. Thirty-five years later, Critcheley et al. reported a correlation between how long a patient had had epilepsy and his or her chance of getting Dupuytren's contracture. They suspected that this was due to phenobarbital therapy, and that the phenobarbital was stimulating peripheral tissue growth factors. Dupuytren's contracture is almost exclusively found in Caucasians, especially those of Viking descent, and highest rates are reported in Northern Scotland, Norway, Iceland, and Australia. It has also been associated with alcoholism, heavy smoking, diabetes mellitus, physical trauma (either penetrating in nature or due to manual labor), tuberculosis, and HIV. People with rheumatoid arthritis are less likely to get this, and Drs. Hart and Hooper speculate that this is also true of gout due to the use of allopurinol. This is the only susceptibility factor that is generally agreed upon. Anticonvulsants do not seem to increase the incidence of Dupuytren's contracture in non-whites. Primidone has other cardiovascular effects in beyond shortening the QT interval. Both it and phenobarbital are associated with elevated serum levels (both fasting and six hours after methionine loading) of homocysteine, an amino acid derived from methionine. This is almost certainly related to the low folate levels reported in primidone users. Elevated levels of homocysteine have been linked to coronary heart disease. In 1985, both drugs were also reported to increase serum levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol, and apolipoproteins A and B. It was first reported to exacerbate hepatic porphyria in 1975. In 1981, it was shown that phenobarbital, one of primidone's metabolites, only induced a significant porphyrin at high concentrations in vitro. It can also cause elevations in hepatic enzymes such as gamma-glutamyl transferase and alkaline phosphatase. Less than 1% of primidone users will experience a rash. Compared to carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and phenytoin, this is very low. The rate is comparable to that of felbamate, vigabatrin, and topiramate. Primidone also causes exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens‚ÄìJohnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. right Primidone, along with phenytoin and phenobarbital, is one of the anticonvulsants most heavily associated with bone diseases such as osteoporosis, osteopenia (which can precede osteoporosis), osteomalacia and fractures. The populations usually said to be most at risk are institutionalized people, postmenopausal women, older men, people taking more than one anticonvulsant, and children, who are also at risk of rickets. However, it has been suggested that bone demineralization is most pronounced in young people (25‚Äì44 years of age) and one 1987 study of institutionalized people found that the rate of osteomalacia in the ones taking anticonvulsants --one out of nineteen individuals taking an anticonvulsant (vs. none among the thirty-seven people taking none) --was similar to that expected in elderly people. The authors speculated that this was due to improvements in diet, sun exposure and exercise in response to earlier findings, and/or that this was because it was sunnier in London than in the Northern European countries which had earlier reported this effect. In any case, the use of more than one anticonvulsant has been associated with an increased prevalence of bone disease in institutionalized epilepsy patients versus institutionalized people who did not have epilepsy. Likewise, postmenopausal women taking anticonvulsants have a greater risk of fracture than their drug-naive counterparts. Anticonvulsants affect the bones in many ways. They cause hypophosphatemia, hypocalcemia, low Vitamin D levels, and increased parathyroid hormone. Anticonvulsants also contribute to the increased rate of fractures by causing somnolence, ataxia, and tremor which would cause gait disturbance, further increasing the risk of fractures on top of the increase due to seizures and the restrictions on activity placed on epileptic people.Increased fracture rate has also been reported for carbamazepine, valproate and clonazepam. The risk of fractures is higher for people taking enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants than for people taking non-enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants. In addition to all of the above, primidone can cause arthralgia. Granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and red-cell hypoplasia and aplasia, and megaloblastic anemia are rarely associated with the use of primidone. Megaloblastic anemia is actually a group of related disorders with different causes that share morphological characteristics--enlarged red blood cells with abnormally high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratios resulting from delayed maturation of nuclei combined with normal maturation of cytoplasm, into abnormal megakaryocytes and sometimes hypersegmented neutrophils; regardless of etiology, all of the megaloblastic anemias involve impaired DNA replication. The anticonvulsant users who get this also tend to eat monotonous diets devoid of fruits and vegetables. This antagonistic effect is not due to the inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase, the enzyme responsible for the reduction of dihydrofolic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid, but rather to defective folate metabolism. In addition to increasing the risk of megaloblastic anemia, primidone, like other older anticonvulsants also increases the risk of neural tube defects, and like other enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants, it increases the likelihood of cardiovascular defects, and cleft lip without cleft palate. Epileptic women are generally advised to take folic acid, but there is conflicting evidence regarding the effectiveness of vitamin supplementation in the prevention of such defects. Additionally, a coagulation defect resembling Vitamin K deficiency has been observed in newborns of mothers taking primidone. Because of this, primidone is a Category D medication. Primidone, like phenobarbital and the benzodiazepines, can also cause sedation in the newborn and also withdrawal within the first few days of life; phenobarbital is the most likely out of all of them to do that. In May 2005, Dr. M. Lopez-Gomez's team reported an association between the use of primidone and depression in epilepsy patients; this same study reported that inadequate seizure control, posttraumatic epilepsy, and polytherapy were also risk factors. Polytherapy was also associated with poor seizure control. Out of all of the risk factors, usage of primidone and inadequate seizure control were the greatest; with ORs of 4.089 and 3.084, respectively. They had been looking for factors associated with depression in epilepsy patients. Schaffer et al. 1999 reported that one of their treatment failures, a 45-year-old woman taking 50 mg a day along with lithium 600 mg/day, clozapine 12.5 mg/day, trazodone 50 mg/day, and alprazolam 4 mg/day for three and a half months experienced auditory hallucinations that led to discontinuation of primidone. It can also cause hyperactivity in children; this most commonly occurs at low serum levels. There is one case of an individual developing catatonic schizophrenia when her serum concentration of primidone went above normal. Primidone is one of the anticonvulsants associated with anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome, others being carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital. This syndrome consists of fever, rash, peripheral leukocytosis, lymphadenopathy, and occasionally hepatic necrosis. Hyperammonemic encephalopathy was reported by Katano Hiroyuki of the Nagoya City Higashi General Hospital in early 2002 in a patient who had been stable on primidone monotherapy for five years before undergoing surgery for astrocytoma, a type of brain tumor. Additionally, her phenobarbital levels were inexplicably elevated post-surgery. This is much more common with the valproates than with any of the barbiturates. A randomized controlled trial whose results were published in the July 1985 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine found that primidone was more likely to cause impotence than phenytoin, carbamazepine, or phenobarbital. Like phenytoin, primidone is rarely associated with lymphadenopathy. Primidone can also cause vomiting; this happens in 1.0‚Äì0.1% of users. =Overdose= The most common symptoms of primidone overdose are coma with loss of deep tendon reflexes and, during the recovery period, if the patient survives, disorientation, dysarthria, nystagmus, and ataxia, lethargy, somnolence, vomiting, nausea, and occasionally, focal neurological deficits which lessen over time. Complete recovery comes within five to seven days of ingestion. The symptoms of primidone poisoning have generally been attributed to its biotransformation to phenobarbital; however, primidone has toxic effects independent of its metabolites in humans. The massive crystalluria that sometimes occurs sets its symptom profile apart from that of phenobarbital. The crystals are white, needle-like, shimmering, hexagonal plates consisting mainly of primidone. In the Netherlands alone, there were thirty-four cases of suspected primidone poisoning between 1978 and 1982. Out of these, Primidone poisoning was much less common than phenobarbital poisoning. Twenty-seven of those adult cases were reported to the Dutch National Poison Control Center. Out of these, one person taking it with phenytoin and phenobarbital died, twelve became drowsy and four were comatose. Treatments for primidone overdose have included hemoperfusion with forced diuresis, a combination of bemegride and amiphenazole; and a combination of bemegride, spironolactone, caffeine, pentylenetetrazol, strophanthin, penicillin and streptomycin. In the three adults who are reported to have succumbed, the doses were 20‚Äì30 g. However, two adult survivors ingested 30 g 25 g, and 22.5 g. One woman experienced symptoms of primidone intoxication after ingesting 750 mg of her roommate's primidone. Interactions Taking primidone with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) such as isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil), procarbazine (Matulane), selegiline (Eldepryl), tranylcypromine (Parnate) or within two weeks of stopping any one of them may potentiate the effects of primidone or change one's seizure patterns. Isoniazid, an antitubercular agent with MAOI properties, has been known to strongly inhibit the metabolism of primidone. Like many anticonvulsants, primidone interacts with other anticonvulsants. Clobazam decreases clearance of primidone, Mesuximide increases plasma levels of phenobarbital in primidone users, both primidone and phenobarbital accelerate the metabolism of carbamazepine via CYP3A4, and lamotrigine's apparent clearance is increased by primidone. In addition to being an inducer of CYP3A4, it is also an inducer of CYP1A2, which causes it to interact with substrates such as fluvoxamine, clozapine, olanzapine, and tricyclic antidepressants. It also interacts with CYP2B6 substrates such as bupropion, efavirenz, promethazine, selegiline, and sertraline; CYP2C8 substrates such as amiodarone, paclitaxel, pioglitazone, repaglinide, and rosiglitazone; and CYP2C9 substrates such as bosentan, celecoxib, dapsone, fluoxetine, glimepiride, glipizide, losartan, montelukast, nateglinide, paclitaxel, phenytoin, sulfonamides, trimethoprim, warfarin, and zafirlukast. It also interacts with estrogens. Primidone and the other enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants can cut the half-life of antipyrine roughly in half (6.2 ¬± 1.9 h vs. 11.2 ¬± 4.2 h), and increases the clearance rate by almost 70%. Phenobarbital reduces the half-life to 4.8 ¬± 1.3 and increases the clearance by almost 109%. It also interferes with the metabolism of dexamethasone, a synthetic steroid hormone, to the point where its withdrawal from the regimen of a 14-year-old living in the United Kingdom made her hypercortisolemic. Tempelhoff and colleagues at the Washington University School of Medicine's Department of Anesthesiology reported in 1990 that primidone and other anticonvulsant drugs increase the amount of fentanyl needed during craniotomy based on the patient's heart rate. Mechanism of action The exact mechanism of primidone's anticonvulsant action is still unknown after over fifty years. It is believed to work via interactions with voltage-gated sodium channels which inhibit high-frequency repetitive firing of action potentials. The effect of primidone in essential tremor is not mediated by PEMA. The major metabolite, phenobarbital, is also a potent anticonvulsant in its own right and likely contributes to primidone's effects in many forms of epilepsy. According to Brenner's Pharmacology textbook, Primidone also increases GABA- mediated chloride flux: thereby hyperpolarizing the membrane potential. Pharmacokinetics Primidone converts to phenobarbital and PEMA; it is still unknown which exact cytochrome P450 enzymes are responsible. The phenobarbital, in turn, is metabolized to p-hydroxyphenobarbital. The rate of primidone metabolism was greatly accelerated by phenobarbital pretreatment, moderately accelerated by primidone pretreatment, and reduced by PEMA pretreatment. In 1983, a new minor metabolite, p-hydroxyprimidone, was discovered. Primidone, carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin are among the most potent hepatic enzyme inducing drugs in existence. This enzyme induction occurs at therapeutic doses. In fact, people taking these drugs have displayed the highest degree of hepatic enzyme induction on record. In addition to being an inducer of CYP3A4, it is also an inducer of CYP1A2, which causes it to interact with substrates such as fluvoxamine, clozapine, olanzapine, and tricyclic antidepressants, as well as potentially increasing the toxicity of tobacco products. Its metabolite, phenobarbital, is a substrate of CYP2C9, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2A6, CYP3A5, CYP1E1, and the CYP2E subfamily. The gene expression of these isoenzymes is regulated by human pregnane receptor X (PXR) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR). Phenobarbital induction of CYP2B6 is mediated by both. Primidone does not activate PXR. The rate of metabolism of primidone into phenobarbital was inversely related to age; the highest rates were in the oldest patients (the maximum age being 55). People aged 70‚Äì81, relative to people aged 18‚Äì26, have decreased renal clearance of primidone, phenobarbital, and PEMA, in ascending order of significance, and that there was a greater proportion of PEMA in the urine. The clinical significance is unknown. The percentage of primidone converted to phenobarbital has been estimated to be 5% in dogs and 15% in humans. Work done twelve years later found that the serum phenobarbital 0.111 mg/100 mL for every mg/kg of primidone ingested. Authors publishing a year earlier estimated that 24.5% of primidone was metabolized to phenobarbital. However, the patient reported by Kappy and Buckley would have had a serum level of 44.4 mg/100 mL instead of 8.5 mg/100 mL if this were true for individuals who have ingested large dose. The patient reported by Morley and Wynne would have had serum barbiturate levels of 50 mg/100 mL, which would have been fatal. History Primidone's effectiveness for epilepsy was first demonstrated in 1949 by Yule Bogue. It was introduced a year later by the Imperial Chemical Industry (ICI), now known as AstraZeneca in the United Kingdom and Germany. In 1952, it was approved in the Netherlands. That same year, Drs. Handley and Stewart demonstrated its effectiveness in the treatment of patients who failed to respond to other therapies; it was noted to be more effective in people with idiopathic generalized epilepsy than in people whose epilepsy had a known cause. Dr. Whitty noted in 1953 that it benefitted patients with psychomotor epilepsy, who were often treatment-resistant. Toxic effects were reported to be mild. That same year, it was approved in France. Primidone was introduced in 1954 under the brandname Mysoline by Wyeth in the United States. The first report associating it with megaloblastic anemia came in 1954 from Drs. Chalmers and Boheimer. Between 1954 and 1957, twenty-one cases of megaloblastic anemia associated with primidone and/or phenytoin were reported. Most cases were due to folic acid deficiency; however, there was one that only responded to B12 therapy and one that required Vitamin C. Some cases were associated with deficient diets; one patient ate mostly bread and butter, another ate bread, buns, and hard candy, and another could rarely be persuaded to eat in the hospital. The idea that folic acid deficiency could cause megaloblastic anemia was not new. What was new was the idea that drugs could cause this in well-nourished people with no intestinal abnormalities. In many cases, it was not clear which drug had caused it. It was speculated that this might be related to the structural similarity between folic acid, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and primidone. Folic acid had been found to alleviate the symptoms of megaloblastic anemia in the 1940s, not long after it was discovered, but the typical patient only made a full recovery--cessation of CNS and PNS symptoms as well as anemia--on B12 therapy. Five years earlier, folic acid deficiency was linked to birth defects in rats. Primidone was seen by some as too valuable to withhold based on the slight possibility of this rare side effect and by others as dangerous enough to be withheld unless phenobarbital or some other barbiturate failed to work for this and other reasons (i.e., reports of permanent psychosis). =Successive anti- convulsants= In Europe, up until 1963, it was not uncommon to prescribe primidone and phenobarbital in combination, often with a stimulant. They were believed to be the most useful for seizures occurring upon awakening, while phenytoin was the most useful for nocturnal seizures. Primidone and phenobarbital were prescribed in combination with phenytoin in diffuse epilepsies. They were third and fourth line-agents, respectively, in the treatment of partial seizures. By 1963, carbamazepine was marketed in most of Europe. It soon became clear that its efficacy in generalized tonic-clonic seizures was the same as phenytoin, that its ability to control partial seizures was superior, along with its tolerability. Sodium valproate was approved in France in 1967. Because the doses were so low (200‚Äì400 mg/day), it was viewed as a moderately effective anticonvulsant whose best quality was its nonsedating nature. In spite of the availability of carbamazepine and valproate, physicians practicing in Mediterranean countries still preferred phenobarbital. Other medications were seen as not usually necessary. Phenytoin was to be used as adjunctive therapy only. In spite of these advances, primidone was still considered to be a \\"sheet-anchor\\" anticonvulsant in the United Kingdom as late as 1969, along with phenobarbital and phenytoin, for the treatment of pediatric epilepsy in spite of its side effects and one of two drugs (the other being sultiame) that were tried in adult patients if a combination of phenytoin and phenobarbital failed to control seizures. A review published that same year stated that carbamazepine did not live up to the claims of those who advocated its use in epilepsy. In 1968, a Dr. Meadow encountered six babies with cleft lip and palate in addition to other congenital abnormalities whose mothers had been taking anticonvulsants. Meadow wrote a letter in The Lancet asking for cases of cleft lip and palate in babies whose mothers had taken anticonvulsants. That same year, Milunsky, Graef, and Gaynor reported cases of cleft lip and palate associated with attempted abortion with methotrexate and aminopterin, which are folic acid antagonists. While it was widely accepted by 1969 that these drugs could interfere with folic acid and that folic acid supplementation might have beneficial somatic effects, it was believed that folic acid supplementation could exacerbate seizures; this included the routine supplements given to pregnant women to prevent megaloblastic anemia. By 1970, the doctor had collected thirty-two cases. Sixteen of them were born to women taking primidone. 25% of the thirty-two cases had congenital heart defects; the reported rate in cleft lip and palate was 3-5%. Meadow emphasized that there was no proof of an association, the immense value of anticonvulsants and the probably small odds of any one epileptic woman having a child with a congenital abnormality. Roman and Caratzali reported in 1971 that the offspring of mice treated with primidone had more abnormal bone metaphases than controls; this was due to chromosomal lesions. By the mid-1970s, it was obvious that this antagonistic effect of primidone was not due to the inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase, the enzyme responsible for the reduction of dihydrofolic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid, but rather to defective folate metabolism. Carbamazepine was approved in the United States for the treatment of adult epilepsy in 1974. Its lack of sedating properties relative to phenobarbital and lack of somatic effects relative to phenytoin generated much interest. Within two years, primidone was no longer seen as the drug of choice for psychomotor epilepsy in the United States. This was because while carbamazepine and primidone are of roughly equal effectiveness, the former is less likely to cause sedation and cognitive impairment. Also, primidone has a greater tendency to cause undesirable psychiatric side effects compared with carbamazepine, which was noted to lessen pre-existing depressive symptoms. By 1978, it looked as if its superior side effect profile would increase its use in epilepsy in the United States. That same year, a review was published stating that primidone and phenobarbital were used less often in the United Kingdom due to their greater tendency to cause behavior disorders and interfere with learning in young children. Valproate was heralded by some as \\"the greatest thing since Greta Garbo\\" and carbamazepine had also risen in popularity. By 1980, primidone was seen as not worth mentioning as an option for childhood temporal lobe epilepsy by doctors in the United Kingdom. In January 1981, Dr. O'Brien and colleagues reported that primidone had a positive effect on the essential tremor of one of their patients. This led them to initiate a twenty-person prospective study. Twelve of the participants responded well. By 1984, valproic acid was the drug of choice for juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and not the equally effective primidone. However, as late as 1985, primidone was still one of the most widely used anticonvulsants. At the close of the 1980s, primidone was still the preferred anticonvulsant for complex partial seizures in Germany. In 1989, Dainippon Pharmaceutical launched Exegran (zonisamide), the first new, chemically unique, non- benzodiazepine anticonvulsant in decades. In 1990, primidone, along with phenobarbital, was a second-line agent in partial epilepsy with or without secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures and was one of four agents (the others being carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital) that was used along with ethosuximide or a benzodiazepine for any absence or myoclonic seizures when valproate failed to control tonic-clonics (at least in the United States). After zonisamide, other new anticonvulsants came onto the market: felbamate, gabapentin, lamotrigine, and vigabatrin. All four were structurally distinct both from other anticonvulsants already on the market. They all had larger protective indexes than conventional agents and unlike these agents, the new ones did not cause birth defects in laboratory animals or antagonize folic acid. They seemed to be relatively mild in terms of side effects. Out of all of them lamotrigine was the most similar to phenytoin in its pattern of efficacy. Felbamate was the most effective for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and was seen as a second-line agent in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy after valproate. These new agents were aggressively marketed. In 1994, felbamate became the anticonvulsant of last resort after ten people out of 100,000 came down with aplastic anemia. By 1994, primidone was no longer one of the most widely used anticonvulsants. Phenytoin was still regarded as the drug of choice for partial seizures due to its long half-life and low cost; but for children, carbamazepine was seen as the best one due to phenytoin's effects on physical appearance. Topiramate was approved two years later. It, along with the others, was mainly used in patients refractory to carbamazepine and valproate. These new agents were often described as having \\"innovative\\" and \\"selective\\" mechanisms of action; in reality, most of them also worked similarly to older agents. On February 28, 1998, √âlan Corporation, plc, bought the trademark and exclusive product distribution rights for Mysoline from Wyeth in Canada and the United States at a cost of $46 million and a royalty on future sales. The actual manufacture and distribution was done by Athena Neurosciences; their name appeared on a Mysoline package information sheet dated June 1998. On November 30, 1999, levetiracetam was approved for the adjunctive treatment of partial epilepsy in adults in the United States. By the year 2000, primidone was something that was prescribed in the event that the patient had tried all other anticonvulsants and was not a candidate for surgery in the United States. In April 2001, √âlan decided to concentrate its efforts towards Zanaflex, Zonegran, Skelaxin, Abelcet, Azactam, Maxipime, Myobloc, and Cutivate. Mysoline was rationalized along with many other products that did not meet \\"certain commercial criteria.\\" Yamanouchi Pharma Technologies, a Palo Alto-based subsidiary of Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, manufactured the actual drug. By 2003, most of the people taking primidone for epilepsy were elderly people who had been taking the drug for many years. In July 2004, Acorus Therapeutics Ltd. took over the manufacture and distribution of Mysoline from AstraZeneca February 3, 2005: almost four years after acquiring it from Elan, Xcel was acquired by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International. On April 1, 2005, Yamanouchi merged with Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd to form Astellas Pharma. As of 2005, it is widely used in the treatment of many forms of epilepsy in developing countries. Available forms Primidone is available as a 250 mg/5mL suspension, and in the form of 50 mg, 125 mg, and 250 mg tablets. It is also available in a chewable tablet formulation in Canada. It is marketed as several different brands including Mysoline (Canada, Ireland, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States), Prysoline (Israel, Rekah Pharmaceutical Products, Ltd.), Apo-Primidone, Liskantin (Germany, Desitin), Resimatil (Germany, Sanofi-Synth√©labo GmbH), Mylepsinum (Germany, AWD.pharma GmbH & Co., KG)., and Sertan (Hungary, 250 mg tablets, ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc.) Other animals Primidone has veterinary uses, including the prevention of aggressive behavior and cannibalism in gilt pigs, and treatment of nervous disorders in dogs and other animals.

He may be best known as a friend of future Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King. Harper is commemorated by a statue on Parliament Hill after his death while trying to save someone from drowning. Born to Henry and Margaret-Ann Harper in Cookstown, Ontario, Harper moved with his family to Barrie in 1880, where he graduated from Barrie Central Collegiate Institute eleven years later. He attended the University of Toronto where he befriended Mackenzie King, who was a fellow student. After completing his Honours degree in Political Science in 1895, Harper became a journalist in London and Toronto, before eventually becoming the Ottawa correspondent for the Montreal Daily Herald. The statue of Sir Galahad in honour of Harper In Ottawa, Harper shared an apartment with Mackenzie King, who was then leading the effort to establish the new Department of Labour under the government of Wilfrid Laurier. In 1900 Harper resigned from the Herald, to work for Mackenzie King as the assistant editor of the Labour Gazette, the Department's main publication. On December 6, 1901, Harper was attending a skating party held on the frozen Ottawa River by the Governor General, the Earl of Minto. Andrew George Blair's daughter Bessie, and Alex Creelman, fell through a patch of weak ice - though Creelman pulled himself to safety, Harper dove into the river to save Blair, and both ultimately drowned. His last words were reportedly \\"What else can I do?\\" when their companions tried to dissuade his rescue attempt, another telling says that he quoted Galahad's famous \\"If I lose myself, I save myself\\" before jumping into the water.Whitaker, Muriel. The Legends of King Arthur in Art. Cambridge: D.S. Brewer, 1990. Their bodies were recovered the following day and Harper was buried in Cookstown on December 9. Mackenzie King was deeply affected by his friend's death, and arranged to become head of the government committee charged with finding some way to honour his sacrifice. Both Mackenzie King and Harper had been fond of Tennyson's Arthurian works, and Mackenzie King decided that Harper would be honoured by a statue of Sir Galahad outside the parliament buildings, with the quote cut into the stone base. Sculptor Ernest Wise Keyser was commissioned and the statue was unveiled in 1905. It remains in place today, in one of the most prominent locations in the city just in front of the main entrance to Parliament Hill. It is the only statue not portraying a politician or monarch. In 1906, Mackenzie King published a book The Secret of Heroism about his friend whom he recalled in his diary entries as \\"the man I loved as I have loved no other man, my father and brother alone excepted\\"In 1909, King's first speech before the House of Commons was preceded by the statement that he marked the eighth anniversary of Harper's sacrifice by placing ten white roses on the base of the statue. His diaries, memos and correspondence with King are kept in the National Archives of Canada.http://www.cain-rcia.ca/cain- bin/cainMain/ItemDisplay?sessionKey=1030035271006_142_13_29_85&l;=0&lvl;=2&v;=0&coll;=1&itm;=185111&rt;=1&bill;=1 Henry Harper is buried in the Harper family plot at the Old Presbyterian Cemetery at Wilson's Hill, located about two miles south of Cookstown.

It is closely associated with the film American Graffiti. Locations and naming There are a number of Mel's in Northern California that share the same general American Graffiti nostalgia theme and the similarly styled Mel's logo. These restaurants are called ‚ÄúOriginal Mels‚Äù. Their locations are not listed on the official Mel's Drive-In website but they have there own website, although an article from the Sacramento Business Journal shows that they're related. A family rift caused the Weisses to part ways and form two chains. The elder Weiss sold his company to Larry Spergel in 1994, who formed a group of about 50 stockholders that now owns the chain. The Walnut Creek, California, location features a history of the original San Francisco Mel's.A 24-hour diner, Original Mels, soon to open on Howe - Sacramento Business Journal: Some Mel's Drive-In locations are not actually drive-ins, but rather diners. For example, while founded in San Francisco, none of the locations in the city currently serve food to patrons‚Äô cars. Mel's Drive-In in the historic Max Factor Building in Hollywood Signage and menus on the original Mel's Diners did not have a possessive apostrophe in the name, as would be expected. However, when Universal Studios recreated the diners at their theme parks in Hollywood, Orlando, Japan, and Singapore, they opted to include the apostrophe in all Mel's Drive-In signage, literature, and media. One location near downtown San Francisco, rechristened Mel's Kitchen, has gone upscale, serving $12 cocktails, $16 burgers with locally sourced beef, ahi poke, acai smoothies, and avocado toast. That site was almost demolished to build housing. Protest In October 1963, the Mel's Drive-In chain was picketed and subjected to a sit-in by the Ad Hoc Committee to End Discrimination over the fact that while the restaurant would serve food to African Americans and hired them as cooks, they were not allowed to work ‚Äúup front‚Äù where they could be seen by white customers. More than 100 protesters were arrested. The picketing ended when Harold Dobbs, a San Francisco City supervisor who had run for mayor and lost, settled with the protesters and began to allow black workers up front. \\"From Freedom Now! to Free Speech: How the 1963-64 Bay Area Civil Rights Demonstrations Paved the Way to Campus Protest\\" by Jo Freeman In popular culture In 1972, the restaurant was selected as a feature location by George Lucas for his 1973 film American Graffiti. The Mel's used was located at 140 South Van Ness Avenue in San Francisco.http://www.melsdrive-in.com/aboutus/history.html It serves as the setting for the opening scene of the film as well as the backdrop for the opening credits, accompanied on the soundtrack by Bill Haley‚Äôs ‚ÄúRock Around the Clock‚Äù. The prominent play given to the location has been credited with having saved the company from possibly going out of business. Signage and artwork from the Mel‚Äôs chain is frequently used in marketing for the film. Universal Studios built a replica of Mel‚Äôs Drive-In on its lot, pursuant to the restaurant being used in American Graffiti ‚Äì this amusement attraction also served as a gift shop for years. Prior to American Graffiti, Mel‚Äôs was used as a location in the 1967 film Guess Who‚Äôs Coming to Dinner. Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn are out for a drive, and Tracy pulls into Mel‚Äôs and orders Oregon boysenberry ice cream; he then has a minor traffic altercation with a black man. The Mel‚Äôs was located in the Excelsior district of San Francisco. Hepburn and Tracy never actually visited the location. Mel‚Äôs restaurants have since been featured in other media, such as Melrose Place (1996, Season 5, Episode 1), Doonesbury comics (December 18, 1989), and the book The American Drive-in by Mike Witzel.

It began as a revolution in three northern districts (Ili, Tarbaghatai and Altai) of Xinjiang Province of the Chinese Republic, resulting in the Ili Rebellion. In 1946 it canceled its independent participation and joined the Xinjiang Provincial Coalition Government, but maintained de facto autonomy. In August 1947, the officials of the ETR withdrew from the Xinjiang Provincial Coalition Government and re-asserted their independence. The rest of Xinjiang was under Kuomintang control. This region is now part (mainly Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture) of the Northern Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of the People's Republic of China (PRC).  Background  From 1934 to 1941 Xinjiang was under the influence of the Soviet Union. The local warlord Sheng Shicai was dependent on the Soviet Union for military support and trade. Soviet troops entered Xinjiang twice, in 1934 and 1937, for limited periods of time to give direct military support to Sheng Shicai's regime. After suppressing the 36th Division General Ma Chung-yin in 1934 and the withdrawal of Soviet troops in 1935, the USSR sent a commission to Xinjiang to draw up a plan for reconstruction of the province, led by Stalin's brother-in-law, Deputy Chief of Soviet State Bank, Alexander Svanidze, which resulted in a Soviet five-year loan of five million gold rubles to Sheng Shicai's regime. The draft was signed by Sheng Shicai on 16 May 1935, without consultation or approval by the Central Government of China. After Soviet intervention in 1937 and quelling of both Tungan and Uyghur rebels on the South of Xinjiang with liquidation of the 36th Tungan Division and 6th Uyghur Division, the Soviet Government did not withdraw all Soviet troops. A regiment of soldiers from the Ministry of Internal Affairs remained in Kumul beginning in October 1937, in order to prevent a possible offensive by the Imperial Japanese Army into Xinjiang via Inner Mongolia. In exchange, concessions were granted for oil wells, tin and tungsten mines and trade terms highly favorable to the USSR. In 1936, after Sheng Shicai expelled 20,000 Kazakhs from Xinjiang (Barkol area) to Qinghai, Hui led by General Ma Bufang massacred their fellow Muslim Kazakhs, until only 135 remained. On November 26, 1940, Sheng Shicai concluded an agreement granting the USSR additional concessions in the province of Xinjiang for fifty years, including areas bordering India and Tibet. This placed Xinjiang under virtually full political and economic control of the USSR, making it part of China in name only. Sheng Shicai recalled in his memoir, \\"Red Failure in Sinkiang,\\" published by the University of Michigan in 1958, that Joseph Stalin pressured him to sign the secret Agreement of Concessions in 1940. The Agreement of Concessions, prepared by Stalin and seventeen articles long, would have resulted in Xinjiang sharing the same fate as Poland. Sheng Shicai was informed of this intended result by Soviet representatives in √úr√ºmqi Bakulin and Karpov. The first article of the agreement stated that The Government of Sinkiang agrees to extend to the Government of the USSR within the territory of Sinkiang exclusive rights to prospect for, investigate and exploit tin mines and its ancillary minerals. Allen S.Whiting and General Sheng Shih-ts'ai \\" Sinkiang: Pawn or Pivot? \\" Michigan State University Press, East Lansing, Michigan 1958, page 280 The USSR established a trust known as Sin-Tin as an independent juridical person subject only to legislative procedures of the USSR for implementation of the provisions of the agreement on Concessions in accordance with Article 4 with the right to establish without hindrance branch offices, sub-branch offices and agencies within the whole territory of SinkiangAllen S.Whiting and General Sheng Shih-ts'ai \\" Sinkiang: Pawn or Pivot? \\" Michigan State University Press, East Lansing, Michigan 1958, page 282 with all supplies of needs of concessions, deliveries of equipment and materials and other imports from USSR and exports of minerals from Sinkiang free of custom duties and other imposts and taxes and payment of a fixed price of five percent of the cost of mined minerals to the Xinjiang Government.Agreement of Concessions, Article 7.

The rental for such allotted areas shall be paid with the products of Sin-tin as provided for in Article 7Allen S.Whiting and General Sheng Shih-ts'ai \\" Sinkiang: Pawn or Pivot? \\" Michigan State University Press, East Lansing, Michigan 1958, page 282,283 Following this agreement on Concessions, large-scale geological exploration expeditions were sent by the Soviets to Xinjiang in 1940 to 1941 and large deposits of uranium, beryllium and other minerals were found in the mountains near Kashgar and in the Altai region. Ores of both minerals continued to be delivered from Xinjiang Altai mines to the USSR until the end of 1949. Soviet geologists continued to work in Xinjiang until 1955, when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev refused Mao Zedong's demand to hand over the technology to produce PRC nuclear weapons. A Chinese atomic project was initiated using facilities built by the Soviet Union in Chuguchak and Altai in Northern Xinjiang. These facilities were used by the Soviet Union for nuclear weapon design and the creation of the first Soviet atomic bomb, successfully tested in the USSR on 29 August 1949. Following Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, and the entry of the United States into World War II in December 1941, the Soviet Union became a less attractive patron for Sheng than the Kuomintang. By 1943 Sheng Shicai switched his allegiance to the Kuomintang after major Soviet defeats at the hands of the Germans in World War II, all Soviet Red Army military forces and technicians residing in the province were expelled,Lin 2007, p. 130. and the Republic of China National Revolutionary Army units and soldiers belonging to Ma Bufang moved into Xinjiang to take control of the province. Ma Bufang helped the Kuomintang build roads linking Qinghai and Xinjiang, which helped both of them bring Xinjiang under their influence. At August 1942 Sheng met Dekanozov, former Soviet ambassador to Nazi Germany and Vice Commissar of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the USSR, in √úr√ºmqi and demanded that the Soviet Union withdraw all military forces and political officers from Xinjiang in three months and remove all Soviet equipment from the territory of Soviet Concessions, including closing the Soviet oil fields in Dushanzi (Jungaria) and the Soviet Aircraft Assembly Plant in √úr√ºmqi (disguised as Agricultural Implements Manufacturing Factory) Allen S.Whiting and General Sheng Shih-ts'ai \\" Sinkiang: Pawn or Pivot? \\" Michigan State University Press, East Lansing, Michigan 1958, page 225. On 29 August 1942, the day after Dekanozov left √úr√ºmqi, Sheng met Madame Chiang Kai-shek, wife of the Chinese Generalissimo, who flew to √úr√ºmqi with a letter from Chiang Kai-shek promising his forgiveness to Sheng for all of his previous deals. Sheng was appointed the head of the Kuomintang branch in Xinjiang in 1943 and allowed Kuomintang cadres into the province. To forge his ties with Kuomintang, on 17 September 1942 Sheng arrested a number of Chinese communists sent to Xinjiang by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1938 and executed them in 1943. Among the executed was Mao Zemin, brother of Mao Zedong. In the summer of 1944, following the German defeat on the Eastern Front, Sheng attempted to reassert control over Xinjiang and turned to the Soviet Union for support again. He arrested a number of Kuomintang cadres in √úr√ºmqi and sent a letter to Stalin offering to \\"incorporate Xinjiang into USSR as its 18th Soviet Socialistic Republic.\\" Sheng Shicai asked Stalin for the post of ruler of the new Soviet Republic. Stalin refused to deal with Sheng and forwarded the confidential letter to Chiang Kai-shek. As a result, the Kuomintang removed him from the province in August 1944 and appointed him to a low-level post in the Ministry of Forestry in Chongqing. In 1944, the Soviets took advantage of discontent among the Turkic peoples of the Ili region in northern Xinjiang to support a rebellion against Kuomintang rule in the province in order to reassert Soviet influence in the region.  Rebellion  Many of the Turkic peoples of the Ili region of Xinjiang had close cultural, political, and economic ties with Russia and then the Soviet Union. Many of them were educated in the Soviet Union and a community of Russian settlers lived in the region. As a result, many of the Turkic rebels fled to the Soviet Union and obtained Soviet assistance in creating the Sinkiang Turkic People's Liberation Committee (STPNLC) in 1943 to revolt against Kuomintang rule during the Ili Rebellion. The pro-Soviet Uyghur who later became leader of the revolt and the Second East Turkestan Republic, Ehmetjan Qasim, was Soviet-educated and described as \\"Stalin's man\\" and as a \\"communist-minded progressive\\". Qasim Russified his surname to \\"Kasimov\\" and became a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Liu Bin-Di was a Hui Muslim Kuomintang (KMT) officer and was sent by officials in √úr√ºmqi to subdue the Hi area and crush the Turkic Muslims, who were prepared to overthrow Chinese rule. His mission failed because his troops arrived too late. Several Turkic cavalry units armed by the Soviets crossed into China in the direction of Kuldja. In November 1944 Liu was killed by Uyghur and Kazakh rebels backed by the Soviet Union. This started the Ili Rebellion, with the Uyghur Ili rebel army fighting against Republic of China forces. Following Sheng Shicai's departure from Xinjiang, the new Kuomintang administration had increasing trouble maintaining law and order. On September 16, 1944, troops that had been sent to Gongha county, a majority Kazakh region, were unable to contain a group of rioters. By October 8, the rioters had captured Nilka, the county seat. During October, the Three Districts Rebellion broke out south of Ghulja in the Ili, Altay and Tarbagatay districts of northern Xinjiang. Aided by the Soviet Union, and supported by several Xinjiang exiles trained in the Soviet Union, the rebels quickly established control over the three districts, capturing Ghulja in November. The ethnic Chinese population of the region was reduced by massacre and expulsion. According to United States consular officials, the Islamic scholar Elihan T√∂re declared a \\"Turkistan Islam Government\\": The rebels assaulted Kulja on 7 November 1944 and rapidly took over parts of the city, massacring KMT troops, however, the rebels encountered fierce resistance from KMT forces holed up in the power and central police stations and did not take them until the 13th. The creation of the \\"East Turkestan Republic\\" (ETR) was declared on the 15th. The Soviet Army assisted the Ili Uyghur army in capturing several towns and airbases. Non-communist Russians like White Russians and Russian settlers who had lived in Xinjiang since the 19th century also helped the Soviet Red Army and the Ili Army rebels. They suffered heavy losses. Many leaders of the East Turkestan Republic were Soviet agents or affiliated with the Soviet Union, like Abdulkerim Abbas, Ishaq Beg, Saifuddin Azizi and the White Russians F. Leskin, A. Polinov, and Glimkin. When the rebels ran into trouble taking the vital Airambek airfield from the Chinese, Soviet military forces directly intervened to help mortar the Airambek and reduce the Chinese stronghold. The rebels engaged in massacres of Han Chinese civilians, especially targeting people affiliated with the KMT and Sheng Shicai. In the \\"Kulja Declaration\\" issued on 5 January 1945, the East Turkestan Republic proclaimed that it would \\"sweep away the Han Chinese\\", threatening to extract a \\"blood debt\\" from the Han. The declaration also declared that the Republic would seek to especially establish cordial ties with the Soviets. The ETR later de-emphasized the anti-Han tone in their official proclamations after they were done massacring most of the Han civilians in their area. The massacres against the Han occurred mostly during 1944‚Äì45, with the KMT responding in kind by torturing, killing, and mutilating ETR prisoners. In territory controlled by the ETR like Kulja, various repressive measures were carried out, like barring Han from owning weapons, operating a Soviet-style secret police, and only making Russian and Turkic languages official and not Chinese. While the non-Muslim Tungusic peoples like the Xibe played a large role in helping the rebels by supplying them with crops, the local Muslim Tungan (Hui) in Ili gave either an insignificant and negligible contribution to the rebels or did not assist them at all. The demands of the rebels included termination of Chinese rule, equality for all nationalities, recognised use of native languages, friendly relations with the Soviet Union, and opposition to Chinese immigration into Xinjiang. The military forces available to the rebellion were the newly formed Ili National Army (INA) and later renamed the East Turkestan National Army, which included mostly Uighur, Kazakh and White Russian soldiers (around 60,000 troops, armed and trained by the Soviet Union, strengthened with regular Red Army units, that included up to 500 officers and 2,000 soldiers), and a group of Kazakh Karai tribesmen under the command of Osman Batur (around 20,000 horsemen). The Kazakhs expanded to the north, while the INA expanded to the south. By September 1945, the Kuomintang Army and the INA occupied positions on either side of the Manasi River near √úr√ºmqi. By this time the ETR held Zungaria and Kashgaria, while the Kuomintang held the √úr√ºmqi (Tihuwa) area. The \\"Ili National Army\\" (INA) which was established on 8 April 1945 as the military arm of the ETR, was led by the Kirghiz Ishaq Beg and the White Russians Polinov and Leskin, and all three were pro-Soviet and had a history of military service with Soviet-associated forces. The Soviets supplied the INA with ammunition and Russian-style uniforms, and Soviet troops directly helped the INA troops fight against the Chinese forces. The INA uniforms and flags all had insignia with the Russian acronym for \\"East Turkestan Republic\\", VTR in Cyrillic (Vostochnaya Turkestanskaya Respublika). Thousands of Soviet troops assisted Turkic rebels in fighting the Chinese army.Potter 1945, \\"Red Troops Reported Aiding Sinkiang Rebels Fight China\\" p. 2 In October 1945 suspected Soviet planes attacked Chinese positions. As the Soviet Red Army and Uyghur Ili Army advanced with Soviet air support against poorly prepared Chinese forces, they almost reached √úr√ºmqi; however, the Chinese military created rings of defences around the area, sending Chinese Muslim cavalry to halt the advance of the Turkic Muslim rebels. Thousands of Chinese Muslim troops under General Ma Bufang and his nephew General Ma Chengxiang poured into Xinjiang from Qinghai to combat the Soviet and Turkic Uyghur forces. Much of the Ili army and equipment originated from the Soviet Union. The Ili rebel army pushed the Chinese forces across the plains and reached Kashgar, Kaghlik and Yarkand. However, the Uyghurs in the oases gave no support to the Soviet-backed rebels and, as a result, the Chinese army was able to expel them. The Ili rebels then butchered livestock belonging to Kirghiz and Tajiks of Xinjiang. The Soviet- backed insurgents destroyed Tajik and Kirghiz crops and moved aggressively against the Tajiks and Kirghiz of China. The Chinese beat back the Soviet- supported rebellion in Sarikol from August 1945 ‚Äì 1946, defeating the siege of the \\"tribesman\\" around Yarkand when they had rebelled in Nanchiang around Sarikol, and killing Red Army officers. The Chinese Muslim Ma Clique warlord of Qinghai, Ma Bufang, was sent with his Muslim cavalry to √úr√ºmqi by the Kuomintang in 1945 to protect it from the Uyghur rebels from Ili.Preston & Partridge & Best 2000, p. 63 Jarman 2001, p. 217. In 1945, the Tungan (Hui) 5th and 42nd Cavalry were sent from Qinghai to Xinjiang where they reinforced the KMT Second Army, composed of four divisions. Their combined forces made for 100,000 Hui and Han troops serving under KMT command in 1945. It was reported the Soviets were eager to \\"liquidate\\" Ma Bufang. General Ma Chengxiang, another Hui Ma Clique officer and nephew of Ma Bufang, commanded the First Cavalry Division in Xinjiang under the KMT, which was formerly the Gansu Fifth Cavalry Army. A cease-fire was declared in 1946, with the Second East Turkestan Republic in control of Ili and the Chinese in control of the rest of Xinjiang, including √úr√ºmqi. Negotiations and Coalition Government in √úr√ºmqi, and the end of ETR Coalition government representatives in 1946 including Chairman Zhang Zhizhong (front row fifth from right) and Vice- chairman Ehmetjan Qasimi (front row fourth from right).

In August 1945, China signed a Treaty of Friendship and Alliance granting the Soviet Union a range of concessions that the United States promised at the Yalta conference. This ended overt Soviet support for the East Turkestan Republic. The Kuomintang's central government of China reached a negotiated settlement with the leaders of the ETR in June 1946. According to the negotiated settlement, on 27 June 1946, the Committee of the Government of ETR laid down Resolution 324, to transform the Committee of the Government of ETR into the council of the Ili Prefecture of Xinjiang Province (the resolution use 'East Turkestan' to denote Xinjiang Province), and end the ETR. The new council was not a government, and the Three Districts were respectively and directly led by the newly founded Xinjiang Provincial Coalition Government along with the other seven districts in Xinjiang. On 1 July 1946, the Xinjiang Provincial Coalition Government was established in √úr√ºmqi. This government was constituted by three sides: the central government of China, the Three Districts, and the Uyghur-inhabited, anti-revolutionary Seven Districts (at the time, Xinjiang Province was divided into ten districts, and the Seven Districts were treated as a unit in the Coalition Government). In the 25 members of the Committee of the Coalition Government, there were seven from the central government, eight from the Three Districts, and ten from the Seven Districts. The communist Ehmetjan Qasim, the leader of the Three Districts, became the Provincial Vice Chairman.ÂéâÂ£∞ (2003) 204-206.ÂæêÁéâÂúª (1998) 132. As the establishment of the Coalition Government, the unpopular governor Wu Zhongxin (chairman of the Government of Xinjiang Province) was replaced by Zhang Zhizhong (chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial Coalition Government), who implemented pro-minority policies to placate the minority population in the Three Districts. After the establishment of the Coalition Government, in effect, little changed in the Three Districts. The Three Districts remained a de facto separate pro-Soviet area with its own currency and military forces. At the beginning, all the three sides of the Coalition Government placed their hopes in it. The Three Districts side discussed with the Coalition Government and the Seven Districts the union of the economy, finance, transport, postal-service systems of the ten districts in Xinjiang again. They discussed the army reorganization of the Three Districts, too. The Three Districts had withdrawn their army from the Seven Districts. However, as the domestic and international situation changed, and the contradiction in the Coalition Government deepened, the Coalition Government was on the verge of collapse in 1947. During 1946 and 1947, the Kuomintang actively supported some politicians opposing the Three Districts. By this time, these opposition politicians included Kazakh leader Osman Batur, who broke with the other rebels when their pro-Soviet orientation became clear. In the Coalition Government, there were several important anti-revolutionary Uyghurs appointed by the Kuomintang, such as Muhammad Amin Bughra, Isa Yusuf Alptekin and Masud Sabri. These three Uyghurs returned to Xinjiang with Zhang Zhizhong in 1945, when the negotiations started.ÂæêÁéâÂúª (1998) 171‚Äì174. As there were too many difficulties, Zhang Zhizhong, the chairman of the Coalition Government, decided to escape from Xinjiang. Bai Chongxi, the Defense Minister of China and a Hui Muslim, was considered for appointment in 1947 as Governor of Xinjiang. But finally, according to Zhang Zhizhong's recommendation, the position was given instead to Masud Sabri, a pro-Kuomintang, anti-Soviet Uyghur. On 21 May 1947, the central government appointed Masud Sabri the new chairman, and Isa Yusuf Alptekin the secretary-general of the Coalition Government. This was fiercely opposed by the Three Districts side, but supported by the Seven Districts side. Masud Sabri was close to conservatives in the CC Clique of the Kuomintang and undid all of Zhang Zhizhong's pro- minority reforms, which set off revolts and riots among the Uyghurs in the oases like Turfan (one of the Seven Districts. Riots in Turfan started in July 1947). On 12 August 1947, Ehmetjan Qasim (the vice-chairman of the Coalition Government and the leader of the Three Districts) left √úr√ºmqi and returned to Ili. Soon afterwards, all the representatives in the Coalition Government from the Three Districts side returned to Ili, too. So the Coalition Government collapsed. After the collapse, the Three Districts reverted to a de facto separate pro-Soviet area. However, this time the Three Districts never rebuilt the old ETR, but remained in Xinjiang Province. The leadership was firmly in the hands of communists. On 3 February 1947, the People's Revolutionary Party (in the Three Districts) and the Xinjiang Communist Union (in √úr√ºmqi) incorporated into the Democratic Revolutionary Party (the chairman was Abdulkerim Abbas), and the party constitution clearly stipulated that one of the party's goals was to oppose the 'Pan-Turkism' and 'Pan-Islam'. Ehmetjan Qasim, Abdulkerim Abbas and other leaders of the Three Districts publicly declared that the Three Districts would not recreate the ETR, but must remain in Xinjiang and China. In order to establish a new organization to govern the Three Districts (from the beginning of the Coalition Government, when the government of ETR dissolved, the Three Districts lost a united government), in August 1948, the Xinjiang Democratic League of Peace Safeguarding was organized. It was both a political party and a leading organization of the Three Districts. To be noticeable, the party used \\"Xinjiang\\" in its name, but did not use \\"East Turkestan\\". This was a milestone for the Three Districts side.ÂéâÂ£∞ (2003) 208-210. After the Collapse of the Coalition Government At the end of Chinese Civil War, in September 1949, when the Kuomintang army and provincial government of Xinjiang switched to the Communist Party of China (CPC) side, the Three Districts joined the CPC side, and accepted the leadership of CPC. Their revolution ended. The leaders of the Three Districts joined CPC (such as Saifuddin Azizi), and the army was reformed into the Fifth Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, then in the 1950s it was transformed into a part of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps. Anti-ETR Uyghurs The KMT CC Clique employed countermeasures in Xinjiang to prevent the conservative, traditionalist religious Uyghurs in the oases in southern Xinjiang from defecting to the pro-Soviet, pro-Russian ETR Uyghurs in Ili in northern Xinjiang. The KMT allowed three anti-Soviet, pan-Turkic nationalist Uyghurs, Masud Sabri, Muhammad Amin Bughra and Isa Yusuf Alptekin to write and publish pan-Turkic nationalist propaganda in order to incite the Turkic peoples against the Soviets, angering them. Anti-Soviet sentiment was espoused by Isa while pro-Soviet sentiment was espoused by Burhan. In 1949, according to Abdurahim Amin, violence broke out at Xinjiang College in Dihua (√úr√ºmqi) between supporters of the Soviets and supporters of Turkey following the screening of a film on the Russo-Turkish wars. The unpopular governor Wu Zhongxin was replaced after the cease-fire with Zhang Zhizhong, who implemented pro-minority policies to placate the Uyghur population. Bai Chongxi, the Defense Minister of China and a Muslim, was considered for appointment in 1947 as Governor of Xinjiang, but the position was given instead to Masud Sabri, a pro-Kuomintang, anti-Soviet Uyghur. Masud Sabri was close to conservatives in the CC Clique of the Kuomintang and undid all of Zhang Zhizhong's pro-minority reforms, which set off revolts and riots among the Uyghurs in the oases like Turfan. American telegrams reported that the Soviet secret police threatened to assassinate Muslim leaders from Ining and put pressure on them to flee to \\"inner China\\" via Tihwa (√úr√ºmqi), White Russians grew fearful of Muslim mobs as they chanted, \\"We freed ourselves from the yellow men, now we must destroy the white.\\" The pan-Turkist 3 Effendis (√úch √Ñp√§ndi), Aisa Alptekin, Memtimin Bughra and Masud Sabri were anti-Soviet Uyghur leaders. The Second East Turkestan Republic attacked them as Kuomintang \\"puppets\\". Achmad (Ehmetjan Qasim) strongly opposed Masud Sabri becoming governor. Ehmetjan Qasim (Achmad-Jan), the Uyghur Ili leader, demanded that Masud Sabri be sacked as governor and that prisoners be released from Kuomintang jails as some of his demands to agreeing to visit Nanjing. Uyghur linguist Ibrahim Muti'i opposed the Second East Turkestan Republic and the Ili Rebellion because it was backed by the Soviets and Stalin. The former ETR leader Saifuddin Azizi later apologized to Ibrahim and admitted that his opposition to the East Turkestan Republic was the correct thing to do. Over 60,000 soldiers were in the Ili army according to General Sung. Kazakh Defection Osman Batur, the Kazakh leader, defected to the Kuomintang, and started fighting against the Soviet and Mongolian armies during the Pei-ta- shan Incident. The Tungan (Chinese Muslim or Hui) 14th Cavalry Regiment, which worked for the Kuomintang, was sent by the Chinese government to attack the Soviet and Mongol armies at Peitashan on the Xinjiang-Mongolia border. The Salar Muslim Gen. Han Youwen, who served under Ma Bufang, commanded the Pau- an-dui (pacification soldiers), composed of three 340-man battalions. They were composed of men of many groups, including Kazakhs, Mongols and White Russians serving the Chinese regime. He served with Osman Batur and his Kazakh forces in battling the Three Districts Ili Uyghur and Soviet forces. The Three Districts forces in the Ashan zone were attacked, defeated and killed by Osman's Kazakh forces during an offensive in September 1947, supported by the Chinese. Osman's Kazakhs seized most of the towns in the Ashan zone from the Three Districts. The acting Soviet consul at Chenghua, Dipshatoff, directed the Red Army in aiding Three Districts Ili forces against Osman's Kazakhs. Pei-ta-shan Incident The Pei-ta-shan Incident was a border conflict between the Republic of China and the Mongolian People's Republic. The Chinese Muslim Hui cavalry regiment was sent by the Chinese government to attack Mongol and Soviet positions, resulting in the conflict. A Xinjiang police station manned by a Chinese police force with Chinese sentry posts existed in Xinjiang both before and after 1945. Chinese Muslim and Kazakh forces working for the Kuomintang, battled Soviet and Mongol troops. In June 1947, the Mongols and the Soviets attacked the Kazakhs, driving them back to the Chinese side of the border. Fighting continued for another year, with thirteen clashes taking place between 5 June 1947, and July 1948. Mongolia invaded Xinjiang to assist Li Rihan, the pro-Russian Special Commissioner, gain control of Xinjiang from Special Commissioner Us Man (Osman), who supported the Republic of China. The Chinese defence ministry spokesman announced that Outer Mongolian soldiers were captured at Peitashan, and stated that troops were resisting near Peitashan. Elite Qinghai Hui cavalry were sent by the Kuomintang to destroy the Mongols and the Russians in 1947. Chinese troops recaptured Peitashan and continued to fight against Soviet and Mongolian bomber planes. China's Legislative Yuan demanded a firmer policy against Russia. The Chinese General Ma Xizhen and the Kazakh Osman Batur fought the Mongol troops and airplanes throughout June 1947. The MPR used a battalion- size force and had Soviet air support in June 1947. The Mongolians repeatedly probed the Chinese lines. Osman continued to fight against the Uyghur forces of the Yili regime in north Ashan after being defeated by Soviet forces. Absorption by the People's Republic of China Ehmetjan Qasimi, Chairman of the Xinjiang Democratic League of Peace Safeguarding, in 1948, Ghulja Saifuddin Azizi, Xi Zhongxun (father of 6th paramount leader of China Xi Jinping), Burhan Shahidi in July 1952 after successful quelling of Ospan Batyr Kazakh insurgency in Xinjiang. In August 1949, the People's Liberation Army captured Lanzhou, the capital of the Gansu Province. Kuomintang administration in Xinjiang was threatened. The Kuomintang Xinjiang provincial leaders Tao Zhiyue and Burhan Shahidi led the government and army's switch to the Communist Party of China (CPC) side in September 1949. By the end of 1949, some Kuomintang officials fled to Afghanistan, India and Pakistan, but most crossed over or surrendered to the CPC. On 17 August 1949, the Communist Party of China sent Deng Liqun to negotiate with the Three Districts' leadership in Ghulja (Yining in Chinese). Mao Zedong invited the leaders of the Three Districts to take part in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference later that year. The leaders of the Three Districts traveled to the Soviet Union on August 22 by automobiles through Horgos, accompanied by Soviet vice-consul in Ghulja Vasiliy Borisov, where they were told to cooperate with the Communist Party of China. Negotiations between Three Districts and Soviet representatives in Alma-Ata continued for three days and were difficult because of the unwillingness of Three Districts leader Ehmetjan Qasimi (whose strategy was opposed by two other delegates-Abdulkerim Abbas and Luo Zhi, while Generals Ishaq Beg and Dalelkhan supported Ehmetjan) to agree to incorporate the Three Districts into the future Chinese communist state, supposedly in 1951. The People's Republic of China was proclaimed two years earlier, on 1 October 1949. Ehmetjan regarded the current situation as a historic opportunity for Uyghurs and other people of Xinjiang to gain freedom and independence that shouldn't be lost. So, the Three Districts delegation was offered to continue negotiations in Moscow directly with Stalin before departure to Beijing. On August 25, the eleven delegates, Ehmetjan Qasimi, Abdulkerim Abbas, Ishaq Beg, Luo Zhi, Dalelkhan Sugirbayev and accompanying officers of the Three Districts, boarded Ilyushin Il-12 plane in Alma-Ata, Kazakhstan, officially heading to Beijing, but flight was diverted for Moscow. On September 3, the Soviet Union informed the Chinese government that the plane had crashed near Lake Baikal en route to Beijing, killing all on board. On the same day Molotov sent a telegram to Ghulja to inform Saifuddin Azizi (interim leader of the Three Districts when Ehmetjan Qasimi was not in Ili, and a member of Communist Party of Soviet Union) about the Tragic death of devoted revolutionaries, including Ehmetjan Qasimi, in airplane crash near Lake Baikal en route to Beijing. In accordance with instructions from Moscow, Saifuddin Azizi kept the news secret from the population of the Three Districts and it was unreported by Beijing for several months Allen S. Whiting and General Sheng Shih-ts'ai \\" Sinkiang: Pawn or Pivot? \\" Michigan State University Press, 1958, East Lansing, Michigan, page 143 until January 1950, when the then-unrecognisable bodies of the Three Districts leaders were delivered from the USSR and when the People's Liberation Army of China had already secured most of the regions of the former Xinjiang Province. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, some former KGB generals and high officers (among them Pavel Sudoplatov) revealed that the five leaders were killed on Stalin's orders in Moscow on 27 August 1949, after a three-day imprisonment in the former Tsar's stables, having been arrested upon arrival in Moscow by the Head of MGB Colonel General Viktor Abakumov, who personally interrogated the Three Districts leaders, then ordered their execution. This was allegedly done in accordance with a deal between Stalin and Mao Zedong,A brief introduction of Uyghur history Birkbeck, University of LondonThe quest for an eighth Turkic nation Taipei Times but this allegation has never been confirmed. The remaining important figures of the Three Districts, including Saifuddin Azizi (who led the Second delegation of the Three Districts, which participated in Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in September in Beijing, which proclaimed the People's Republic of China on 1 October 1949), agreed to incorporate the Three Districts into the Xinjiang Province and accept important positions within the administration. However, some Kazakhs led by Osman Batur continued their resistance until 1954.Xinjiang by S. Frederick Starr Saifuddin then became the first chairman of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, which replaced Xinjiang Province in 1955. First People's Liberation Army units arrived at √úr√ºmqi airport on 20 October 1949 on Soviet airplanes, provided by Stalin, and quickly established control in northern Xinjiang, then, together with units of the National Army of the Three Districts, entered southern Xinjiang, thus establishing control over all ten districts of Xinjiang Province. Earlier, on a single day, on 26 September 1949, 100,000 Kuomintang Army troops in the province switched their allegiance from Kuomintang to the Communist Party of China together with the Chairman of Xinjiang Provincial Government Burhan Shahidi, who was among the few who knew what actually happened to the First delegation of the Three Districts in August in the USSR. On 20 December 1949 the Ili National Army joined PLA as its 5th Army. The province's final status was instituted in 1955, when it was reorganised into an autonomous region for the 13 nationalities of Xinjiang ( Uyghur, Han Chinese, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Hui, Mongol, Tajik, Uzbek, Tatar, Russian, Xibe, Daur, Manchu people). National army The National Army of the Second East Turkestan Republic was formed on 8 April 1945, and originally consisted of six regiments: # Suidun infantry regiment # Ghulja regiment # Kensai regiment # Ghulja reserve regiment # Kazakh cavalry regiment # Tungan regiment # Sibo battalion # Mongol battalion General conscription of all races, except the Chinese, into the National Army was enforced in the Ili zone. Later, Sibo and Mongol battalions were upgraded to regiments. When Kazakh irregulars under Osman Batur defected to the Kuomintang in 1947, the Kazakh cavalry regiment of National Army also defected to Osman Batur. The motorized part of Army consisted of an Artillery Division, which included twelve cannons, two armoured vehicles, and two tanks. National aviation forces included forty-two airplanes, captured at a Kuomintang air base in Ghulja on 31 January 1945; all of them were damaged during the battle for the base. Some of these aircraft were repaired and put into service by Soviet military personnel in ETR. These airplanes participated in the battle between Ili rebels and the Kuomintang for Shihezi and Jinghe in September 1945. This battle resulted in the capture of both KMT bases and oil fields in Dushanzi. During the battle, one more Kuomintang airplane was captured, detachments of National Army reached Manasi River north of √úr√ºmqi, which caused panic in the city. Government offices were evacuated to Kumul. An offensive on Xinjiang's capital was cancelled due to direct pressure from Moscow on Ili rebels' leadership, which agreed to follow orders from Moscow to begin peace talks with Kuomintang. Moscow ordered the National Army to cease fire on all frontiers. First peace talks between Ili rebels and Kuomintang followed Chiang Kai-shek's speech on China State Radio, offering \\"to peacefully resolve Xinjiang crisis\\" with the rebels. These peace talks were mediated by the Soviet Union and started in √úr√ºmqi on 14 October 1945. The National Army enlisted 25,000 to 30,000 troops. In accordance with the peace agreement with Chiang Kai-shek signed on 6 June 1946, this number was reduced to 11,000 to 12,000 troops and restricted to stations in only the Three Districts (Ili, Tarbaghatai and Altai) of northern Xinjiang. National Army detachments were also withdrawn from southern Xinjiang, leaving the strategic city of Aksu and opening the road from √úr√ºmqi to the Kashgar region. This allowed the Kuomintang to send 70,000 troops from 1946 to 1947 and quell the rebellion in the Pamir Mountains. The rebellion was broken on 19 August 1945, in the Sariqol area of Taghdumbash Pamir. Rebels led by the Uyghur Sadiq Khan Khoja from Kargilik and the Sariqoli Tajik Karavan Shah captured all the border posts near the Afghan, Soviet and Indian borders (Su-Bashi, Daftar, Mintaka Qarawul, Bulunqul), and a Tashkurgan fortress, killing Kuomintang troops. The rebels took Kuomintang troops by surprise as they celebrated the capitulation of Japanese Army in Manchuria. A few Kuomintang forces in Sariqol survived and fled to India during the rebel attack. The original base of the rebellion was situated on the mountainous Pamir village of Tagarma, near the Soviet border. On 15 September 1945, Tashkurgan rebels took Igiz-Yar on the road to Yangihissar, while another group of rebels simultaneously took Oitagh, Bostan- Terek and Tashmalik on the road to Kashgar. By the end of 1945, Tashkurgan rebels had attacked Kashgar and Yarkand districts. On 2 January 1946, while the Preliminary Peace Agreement was signed in √úr√ºmqi between Ili rebels and Kuomintang representatives under Soviet mediation, rebels took Guma, Kargilik and Poskam, important towns controlling communications between Xinjiang, Tibet and India. On 11 January 1946, the Kuomintang Army counter-attacked the Yarkand military zone, bringing reinforcements from Aksu Region. The counter- attackers repelled Tashkurgan rebels from the outskirts of Yarkand, recaptured the towns of Poskam, Kargilik and Guma and brought the Tashkurgan Region back under Chinese control by the summer of 1946. Only a few hundred of the 7000 rebels survived. The survivors retreated to the mountainous Pamir base in Qosrap (village in present-day Akto County). The National Army was partially active in Kashgar and Aksu from 1946 to 1949 until the arrival of People's Liberation Army (PLA) units in Xinjiang. Deng Liqun, a special envoy of Mao Zedong, arrived at Ghulja on 17 August 1949 to negotiate with the Three Districts leadership about the districts' future. Deng sent a secret telegram to Mao about the Three Districts forces the following day. He listed these forces as including about 14,000 troops, armed mostly with German weapons, heavy artillery, 120 military trucks and artillery-towing vehicles, and around 6,000 cavalry horses. Soviet military personnel were present in the Army and serviced fourteen airplanes, which were used as bombers. On 20 December 1949, the National Army was incorporated into the PLA as its Xinjiang 5th Army Corps. Press The newspaper of East Turkestan was Azat Sherkiy Turkistan (Free Eastern Turkestan), first published on 17 November 1944, in Ghulja five days after the establishment of the Second ETR Government. The newspaper was later renamed as Inqlawiy Sherkiy Turkistan (Revolutionary Eastern Turkestan). Related events and people According to her autobiography, Dragon Fighter: One Woman's Epic Struggle for Peace with China, Rebiya Kadeer's father served with pro-Soviet Uyghur rebels under the Second East Turkestan Republic in the Ili Rebellion (Three Province Rebellion) in 1944‚Äì1946, using Soviet assistance and aid to fight the Republic of China government under Chiang Kai-shek.Kadeer 2009 , p. 9. Kadeer and her family were close friends with White Russian exiles living in Xinjiang and Kadeer recalled that many Uyghurs thought Russian culture was \\"more advanced\\" than that of the Uyghurs and they \\"respected\\" the Russians a lot.Kadeer 2009 , p. 13. In the Xinjiang conflict, the Soviet Union again backed Uyghur separatists against China, starting in the 1960s. The Soviet Union incited separatist activities in Xinjiang through propaganda, encouraging Kazakhs to flee to the Soviet Union and attacking China. China responded by reinforcing the Xinjiang-Soviet border area specifically with Han Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (\\"Bingtuan\\" in Chinese) militia and farmers.Starr 2004 , p. 138. The Soviets intensified their broadcasts inciting Uyghurs to revolt against the Chinese via Radio Tashkent since 1967 and directly harbored and supported separatist guerilla fighters to attack the Chinese border, in 1966 there were 5.000 Soviet- sponsored separatist attacks on China.Starr 2004 , p. 139. The Soviets transmitted a radio broadcast from Radio Tashkent into Xinjiang on 14 May 1967, boasting of the fact that the Soviets had supported the Second East Turkestan Republic against China. In addition to Radio Tashkent, other Soviet media outlets urged Uyghurs to proclaim independence and revolt against China, including Radio Alma-Ata and the Alma-Ata published Sherki T√ºrkistan Evazi (\\"The Voice of Eastern Turkestan\\") newspaper. After the Sino-Soviet split in 1962, over 60,000 Uyghurs and Kazakhs defected from Xinjiang to the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, in response to Soviet propaganda which promised Xinjiang independence. Uyghur exiles later threatened China with rumors of a Uyghur \\"liberation army\\" in the thousands that were supposedly recruited from Sovietized √©migr√©s. The Soviet Union was involved in funding and support for the East Turkestan People's Revolutionary Party (ETPRP), the largest militant Uyghur separatist organization in its time, to start a violent uprising against China in 1968.Dillon 2003 , p. 57.Clarke 2011 , p. 69.Dillon 2008 , p. 147.Nathan 2008, . In the 1970s, the Soviets also supported the United Revolutionary Front of East Turkestan (URFET) to fight against the Chinese.Reed 2010 , p. 37. \\"Bloody incidents\\" in 1966‚Äì67 flared as Chinese and Soviet forces clashed along the border as the Soviets trained anti-Chinese guerillas and urged Uyghurs to revolt against China, hailing their \\"national liberation struggle\\". In 1969, Chinese and Soviet forces directly fought each other along the Xinjiang-Soviet border.Tinibai 2010, Bloomberg Businessweek p. 1 The Soviet Union supported Uyghur nationalist propaganda and Uyghur separatist movements against China. Soviet historians claimed that the Uyghur native land was Xinjiang and Uyghur nationalism was promoted by Soviet versions of Turcological history. Soviet Turcologists like D.I. Tikhonov wrote pro-independence works on Uyghur history and the Soviet-supported Uyghur historian Tursun Rakhimov wrote more historical works supporting Uyghur independence and attacking the Chinese government, claiming that Xinjiang was an entity created by China from parts of East Turkestan and Zungharia. These Soviet Uyghur historians waged an \\"ideological war\\" against China, emphasizing the \\"national liberation movement\\" of Uyghurs throughout history. The Soviet Communist Party supported the publication of works which glorified the Second East Turkestan Republic and the Ili Rebellion against China in its anti-China propaganda war. Soviet propaganda writers wrote works claiming that Uyghurs lived better lives and were able to practice their culture only in Soviet Central Asia and not in Xinjiang. In 1979 Soviet KGB agent Victor Louis wrote a thesis claiming that the Soviets should support a \\"war of liberation\\" against \\"imperial\\" China to support Uighur, Tibetan, Mongol and Manchu independence.Wong 2002 , p. 172.Liew 2004 , p. 175. The Soviet KGB supported Uyghur separatists against China.Wang 2008 , p. 240. Xinjiang's importance to China increased after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, leading to China's perception of being encircled by the Soviets.Clarke 2011 , p. 76. China supported the Afghan mujahideen during the Soviet invasion, and broadcast reports of Soviet atrocities on Afghan Muslims to Uyghurs in order to counter Soviet propaganda broadcasts into Xinjiang, which boasted that Soviet minorities lived better and incited Muslims to revolt. Chinese radio beamed anti-Soviet broadcasts to Central Asian ethnic minorities like the Kazakhs. The Soviets feared disloyalty among the non-Russian Kazakh, Uzbek and Kyrgyz in the event of Chinese troops attacking the Soviet Union and entering Central Asia. Russians were goaded with the taunt \\"Just wait till the Chinese get here, they'll show you what's what!\\" by Central Asians when they had altercations.Meehan 1980. The Chinese authorities viewed the Han migrants in Xinjiang as vital to defending the area against the Soviet Union.Clarke 2011 , p. 78. China opened camps to train the Afghan Mujahideen near Kashgar and Khotan and supplied them with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of small arms, rockets, mines, and anti-tank weapons.Starr 2004 , p. 149.Starr 2004 , p. 158. Similar Soviet-supported states The Soviet Union set up similar puppet-states in Pahlavi-dynasty Iran in the form of the Azerbaijan People's Government and Republic of Mahabad. The Soviet Union used comparable methods and tactics in both Xinjiang and Iran upon establishing the Kurdish Republic of Mahabad and Autonomous Republic of Azerbaijan. The American ambassador to the Soviet Union sent a telegram to Washington DC noting the similarity of the situations in Iranian Azerbaijan and in Xinjiang.

Environment The Bar Room includes a restaurant, a lounge and, as the name implies, a bar. The walls and ceiling of the Bar Room are covered with antique toys and sports memorabilia donated by famous patrons. Perhaps the best known feature of 21 is the line of painted cast iron lawn jockey statues which adorns the balcony above the entrance. In the 1930s, some of the affluent customers of the bar began to show their appreciation by presenting 21 with jockeys painted to represent the racing colors of the stables they owned. There are 33 jockeys on the exterior of the building, and 2 more inside the doors. History The first version of the club opened in Greenwich Village in 1922, run by cousins Jack Kreindler and Charlie Berns. It was originally a small speakeasy known as the Red Head. In 1925 the location was moved to a basement on Washington Place and its name was changed to Front√≥n. The following year it moved uptown to 42 West 49th Street, changed its name to the Puncheon Club, and became much more exclusive. In late 1929, to make way for the construction of Rockefeller Center, the club moved to its current location and changed its name to \\"Jack and Charlie's 21\\". Although raided by police on many occasions during Prohibition, the premises staff had methods to protect the club from the authorities. As soon as a raid began, a system of levers was used to tip the shelves of the bar, sweeping the liquor bottles through a chute and into the city's sewers. The bar also included a secret wine cellar, which was accessed through a hidden door in a brick wall which opened into the basement of the building next door (number 19). Though still used as a wine cellar today, part of the vault has been remodeled to allow a party of up to 20 guests to dine in private. The club also stored the private wine collections of John F. Kennedy; Richard Nixon; Gerald Ford; Joan Crawford; Elizabeth Taylor; Hugh Carey; Ernest Hemingway; the Nordstrom sisters; Frank Sinatra; Al Jolson; Gloria Vanderbilt; Sophia Loren; Mae West; Aristotle Onassis; Gene Kelly; Gloria Swanson; Judy Garland; Sammy Davis, Jr.; and Marilyn Monroe. At Christmas time, the regular clientele received silk scarves decorated with a motif of the club insignia. Each scarf is numbered and has the Jockey logo and also features the railings associated with the building. Some of the most unusual and desirable were designed by Ray Strauss, founder of Symphony Scarves, in the 1950s and '60s. A number of these can be seen in a 1989 book by Andrew Baseman, The Scarf. Siggie Nordstrom had a collection of several dozen of these she'd received through the years. The prestigious International Debutante Ball, which has presented many daughters and granddaughters of U.S. presidents to high society at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City, has hosted its pre-ball parties at 21 Club.

Early life Straight was born in New York City, the son of Willard Dickerman Straight (1880‚Äì1918), an investment banker who died in Michael's infancy, and Dorothy Payne Whitney (1887‚Äì1968), a philanthropist. Straight was educated at Lincoln School in New York City and, after his mother's remarriage to Leonard Knight Elmhirst (1893‚Äì1974), in England at his family's Dartington Hall, followed by studies at the London School of Economics. His siblings were racing driver Whitney Straight and Academy Award-winning actress Beatrice Straight. Straight's maternal grandparents were Flora Payne and William Collins Whitney (1841‚Äì1904), the United States Secretary of the Navy during the first Cleveland administration. Flora was the daughter of Senator Henry B. Payne of Ohio and sister of Colonel Oliver Hazard Payne. Career While a student at Trinity College, Cambridge in the mid-1930s, Straight became a Communist Party member and a part of an intellectual secret society known as the Cambridge Apostles. Straight worked for the Soviet Union as part of a spy ring whose members included Donald Maclean, Guy Burgess, Kim Philby and KGB recruiter Anthony Blunt, who had briefly been Straight's lover. A document from Soviet archives of a report that Blunt made in 1943 to the KGB states, \\"As you already know the actual recruits whom I took were Michael Straight\\". After returning to the United States in 1937, Straight worked as a speechwriter for President Franklin D. Roosevelt and was on the payroll of the Department of the Interior. Beginning in 1938, Straight carried on a covert relationship with Iskhak Akhmerov, the KGB spy. In 1940, Straight went to work in the Eastern Division of the United States Department of State. In 1942, Straight joined the United States Army Air Forces, where he served as the pilot of a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, although he never saw combat. After the war, he took over as publisher of The New Republic, which was owned by his family. During his tenure, Straight hired former US vice president and future presidential candidate Henry A. Wallace to serve as the magazine's editor. Straight's writing for the magazine included a glowing review of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings when it was published.\\"The Fantastic World of Professor Tolkien\\", Michael Straight, January 17, 1956, New republic In 1956, Straight left the magazine and began writing novels. However, in 1963, in response to an offer of government employment in Washington, D.C., Straight faced a background check, and decided voluntarily to inform family friend and presidential special assistant Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. about his communist connections at Cambridge. This led directly to the exposure of Blunt as the recruiter of the Cambridge Five spy ring. Straight served as the deputy chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts from 1969 to 1977. In 1988, he published Nancy Hanks: An Intimate Portrait, which told the story of the second chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, with whom he had worked. =Memoirs and novels= Straight wrote several novels, including Carrington (1960), about the Fetterman massacre of 1866, and A Very Small Remnant\\"Except the LORD of Hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like unto Gomorrah.\\" Isaiah 1:9. (1963), about the Sand Creek massacre of 1864, both Westerns that received respectful reviews, as well as Happy and Hopeless (1979), a love story set in the Kennedy Administration that he published himself. In 1983, Straight detailed his Communist activities in a memoir entitled After Long Silence. (). His second memoir, On Green Spring Farm: The Life and Times of One Family in Fairfax County, Va., 1942 to 1966 was published posthumously by Devon Press. Personal life The Newton D. Baker House, Straight's Georgetown home until 1976 In September 1939, he married Belinda Crompton (1920‚Äì2015) of Wilton, New Hampshire who was a child psychiatrist. Together with Belinda, until their divorce in 1969, he had five children: * David Straight * Michael Straight Jr. * Susan Straight * Diana Straight (Krosnick) * Dorothy Straight (b. 1958), who was the youngest published author. In 1965, Straight purchased the former Georgetown home of Jackie Kennedy, located at 3017 N Street, for $200,000 (). Kennedy bought the home when she moved out of the White House and Straight purchased it when Kennedy moved to New York City. In 1974, Straight married his second wife, Nina G. Auchincloss Steers, the daughter of Nina Gore and Hugh D. Auchincloss. Steers was the half-sister of writer Gore Vidal and, coincidentally, a stepsister of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Nina had previously been married to Newton Steers from 1957-1974 and with him she had three children: Hugh Auchincloss Steers (1963‚Äì1995), Ivan Steers, and Burr Steers (born 1965). The wedding was attended by Hugh D. Auchincloss, Janet Auchincloss, Jackie Kennedy, Renata Adler, Beatrice Straight, and Peter Cookson. Straight lived in the Georgetown home from 1964 until 1976 when he sold it to Yolande Bebeze Fox, the former Miss America 1951. Straight and his wife spent $125,000 () renovating the home and decided to move to Bethesda, Maryland in 1976 when he was vice chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts. They subsequently divorced and in 1998, he married Katharine Gould, a child psychiatrist and art historian. Straight died of pancreatic cancer at his home in Chicago, Illinois, on January 4, 2004, aged 87. He also had a home on Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts.

And it also known by its nickname ‚Ä≥ill Pllate‚Ä≥.Island History In the 1840s there was sufficient guano on the island to make it worthwhile excavating, and it was still won in the 20th century. A visitor in 1905 stated that 1500 tons had been taken off the island the month before he arrived. He also reported on the island's ‚Äúbeautiful plantation of coconuts which yields about 20,000 a month,‚Äù the fine condition of the palms presumably due to the guano rich soil. The island was not always so productive. In 1864 the Great Britain Civil Commissioner complained that ‚Äúdespite 18 years‚Äô occupation only 17 coconut trees have been planted‚Äù. In 1828 Platte was proposed as a suitable location for an isolation camp for leprosy sufferers, but in 1838 the island was taken over by the British administration for use as a quarantine station for visiting ships instead. It did not prove entirely satisfactory. Being at some distance from authority, the crews of the ships, in particular the whalers, tended to run amok, causing ‚Äúdepredations‚Äù. By 1864 the Civil Commissioner had further complaints about the use of Platte as a quarantine island. He did not think it ‚Äùof much potential utility because it is 71 miles from Mah√© and vessels of 500 tons burden cannot approach nearer than 5 miles because of the dangerous reef. Also during the SE monsoon it is almost inaccessible to any vessel‚Äù. He was dubious as to the possibility of building any infrastructure on the island because ‚Äúan erection on Flat Island would be‚Ä¶expensive ‚Äì it is entirely coral with no timber, trees having been removed to plant coconuts‚Ä¶The only house is a hut constructed of leaves. No provisions except for fish are available. There is sufficient dead wood to burn lime and there is coral for building but all labourers and rations would have to come from Mah√© at great expense‚Äù. He noted that the last time a ship was put in quarantine, Long Island was actually used, but his preference was to use Moyenne Island as the quarantine station. =Coral reefs= Barrier reefs, over which the sea breaks heavily, extend north, east, and south of the island, making it a pseudo-atoll. Within the barrier reefs, the lagoon is quite smooth, and landing is safe and easy. A submerged coral reef rim extends west and south of the island, obviously the remnants of a sunken atoll, creating a complex of almost in length north-south and in width east-west and covering an area of roughly 270 km2. There are two tricky passages through the reef on the northwest side, available only for small vessels with local knowledge only. La Perle Reef lies at the southwestern end of the reef rim, about southwest of Platte Island. Depths of less than can exist on this reef where breakers have been observed. Demographics There is a small settlement on the western shore with the manager's house and a few guest cottages to the northwest. There is also an abandoned Church and abandoned hospital. The Island Development Company (IDC) plans to build a hotel instead of the guesthousesPlatte Island plancourt sustains new Platte resort Administration Platte island is administered by the Island Development Company (IDC). Due to its small population, there are no government buildings or services. Many services are only provided in the Seychelles' capital Victoria, which is difficult to reach. Workers have to undergo a medical examination before coming to the Island to prove their physical ability to stay there for a longer term without quick access to health care. The IDC replenishes all consumption goods needed by Platte island every three month, e.g. food, fuel, medicine, and working equipment. Transport Platte island is bisected by a 1000 m airfield that follows the long north-south axis, 23 m wide east-west, and 3 m above the sea level. The island is occasionally serviced by an Island Development Company (IDC) aircraft from Mah√©. Platte Island also has a jetty 3 m deep that a landing craft of 400-500 t can reach at a minimum tide of 1.5 m. Economics The inhabitants on the island are engaged in very small scale farming and fishing activities mainly for self-supply as of 2004. An plan proposed by IDC for Platte's development in the future involves a mixture of tourism, fishery, agriculture, building development and conservation. Flora and fauna The island is known for its rich fish life. The red-footed booby and sooty tern used to breed there but are now extinct. The brown noddy and white-tailed tropicbird still breed while hundreds of lesser noddies and bridled terns roost at night. Barn owls were introduced in 1949 but died out in 1951-1952. The red fody also breeds on the island. A year-long turtle study conducted in 1998 demonstrated that Platte has significant populations of some 40 female hawksbill sea turtles nesting annually.

She wrote on moral philosophy, theological tracts, and had a voluminous correspondence. Trotter's work addresses a range of issues including necessity, the infinitude of space, and the substance, but she focuses on moral issues. She thought that moral principles are not innate, but discoverable by each individual through the use of the faculty of reason endowed by God. In 1702, she published her first major philosophical work, A Defence of Mr. Lock's [sic.] An Essay Concerning Human Understanding. John Locke was so pleased with this defence that he made gifts of money and books to his young apologist acting through Elizabeth Burnet who had first made Locke aware of Trotter's \\"Defence\\". Her work attracted the attention of William Warburton, who prefaced her last philosophical work. She also had a request from the biographer Thomas Birch to aid him in compiling a collection of her works. She agreed to the project but died before the work could be printed. Birch posthumously published a two- volume collection entitled The Works of Mrs. Catharine Cockburn, Theological, Moral, Dramatic, and Poetical in 1751. It is largely through this text that readers and history have come to know her. Early years and education Catharine Trotter was born in London, on 16 August, 1674 or 1679. Both her parents were Scotch. Her father, Captain David Trotter, was a commodore in the Royal Navy, personally known to King Charles II, and the Duke of York, who admired his high qualities and appreciated his distinguished services. Captain Trotter assisted in the demolition of Tangier in 1683, and being subsequently sent to convoy the fleet of merchant ships belonging to the Turkey Company, died of the plague at Alexandretta (Iscanderoon), early in the year 1684. His property having fallen into dishonest hands, the two-fold affliction of bereavement and poverty fell at once upon his widow and children. Her mother was Sarah Bellenden, a near relation of Lord Bellenden, and of the Duke of Lauderdale, and the Earl of Perth. Trotter was raised Protestant but converted to Roman Catholicism at an early age. During the short remainder of King Charles II.‚Äôs reign, Mrs. Trotter had a pension from the Admiralty, and Queen Anne made her an allowance of 20 ¬£ a-year. It is to be supposed that the widow also received assistance from her husband‚Äôs brother, and from her own high- born and wealthy cousins, in bringing up her two fatherless children. Both were daughters. The elder married Dr. Inglis, a medical officer, who attended the Duke of Marlborough in his campaigns, and became physician-general to the army. Catharine, the youngest, was early remarkable for her sagacious intellect, for her facility in acquiring knowledge, her cleverness in teaching herself the art of penmanship, and her delight in making extemporary verse. Nothing is recorded of her education, but from her own allusion to it in her \\"Poem on the Busts\\", it may be inferred to have been slight and ordinary. Nothing, however, could repress her eager desire for information; and obstacles, as usual, proved incentives to effort. She read with avidity, and wrote with emulative zeal; works of imagination occupying, as in such cases they are wont, her childish attention; and these, as her reasoning powers matured, and her judgment became formed, giving place to tractates and treatises on moral philosophy and religion. She taught herself the French language, and, with the assistance of a friend, acquired the Latin. Her Verses written at the age of fourteen, and sent to Mr. Beville Higgons, on his sickness and recovery from the small-pox, though rather a bold avowal of sympathy with the ‚Äúlovely youth,‚Äù and of admiration for his matchless charms,‚Äù were evidently well-meant admonitions to resignation, and to the conscientious application of the high qualities and fine ‚Äúparts‚Äù ascribed to him. Early productions Her muse was always didactic, and although her Songs, after the fashion of her time, were full of amatory context, they inculcated self- government and morality. The professional connections of her father, the aristocratic relationships of her mother, and the celebrity early won by her own extraordinary talents, gained her a large circle of acquaintance; and although straitened in the means of subsistence, and probably possessing little of her own but the earnings of her pen, Trotter moved in the best society, and was a frequent and welcome guest in the houses of the rich and great. Her beauty, and the unaffected sweetness of her manners, bore the charm of unasserted mental superiority. The title page of a 1696 edition of Trotter's Agnes de Castro. Trotter was a precocious and largely self-educated young woman, who had her first novel (The Adventures of a Young Lady, later retitled Olinda's Adventures) published anonymously in 1693, when she was but 14 years old. Her first published play, Agnes de Castro, was staged two years later, in the year 1695, at the Theatre Royal, and printed in the following year, with a dedication to the Earl of Dorset and Middlesex, from which it appears that his Lordship was one of her personal friends and advisers. This tragedy was not based upon historic fact, but upon Aphra Behn‚Äôs English translation of a French novel. In 1696, she was famously satirised alongside Delarivier Manley and Mary Pix in the anonymous play, The Female Wits. In it, Trotter was lampooned in the figure of \\"Calista, a lady who pretends to the learned languages and assumes to herself the name of critic.\\" The following year, Trotter addressed to William Congreve a set of complimentary verses on his The Mourning Bride, and thus either created or strengthened the interest which that poet took in her literary proceedings. His published letter to her shows that they had been previously acquainted. In 1698, her second tragedy and arguably best-liked play, Fatal Friendship, was performed at the then-new theatre in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields. It was afterwards printed with a dedication to the Princess of Wales, and not only established Trotter's reputation as a dramatic writer, and brought a shower of complimentary verses, but increased the number of her powerful, fashionable, and eminent friends. It may reasonably be supposed, produced great pecuniary profit. Prefixed to her Fatal Friendship are many sets of eulogistic verses addressed to the authoress; one by P. Harman, who also wrote the prologue; one by an anonymous writer, probably Lady Sarah Piers; and yet another, written by the playwright, John Hughes, who hailed her as ‚Äúthe first of stage reformers.‚Äù The language is plain and unaffected, but occasionally deformed, after the colloquial fashion introduced at the Restoration, by the abbreviated words ‚Äú ‚Äôem‚Äù for them. The plot is commonplace, but well complicated, and it produces some good dramatic situations. The moral drawn at the conclusion is:‚Äî ‚ÄúNone know their strength, let the most resolute Learn from this story to distrust themselves, Nor think by fear the victory less sure; Our greatest danger is when we‚Äôre most secure.\\" This tragedy, having been deemed by contemporary critics of the time as the best of Trotter's dramatic compositions, left the reader little cause to join in Dr. Birch's regret that want of space enforced the omission of the four other plays from his edition of her works. In 1700, she was one of the presumptuous Englishwomen who, under the several names of the Nine Muses, bewailed in verse the death of John Dryden. She was consequently praised and addressed as a Muse by a troop of admiring rhymers. Early in the year 1701, her comedy of Love at a Loss, or Most Votes carry it, was performed at the Theatre Royal, and published in the month of May of the same year, with a dedication to Lady Piers. ‚ÄúShe had,‚Äù remarks Dr. Birch, ‚Äúcontracted a very early esteem for, and most intimate and unreserved friendship,‚Äù with Trotter. Later in the same year, her third tragedy, The Unhappy Penitent, was performed at Drury Lane, and published in August, with a dedication to Lord Halifax, and a set of verses, by Lady Piers, prefixed, inscribed ‚ÄúTo the excellent Mrs. Catherine Trotter‚Äù. Also in 1701, she wrote her Defence of Mr. Locke‚Äôs Essay of Human Understanding, and it was published in May, 1702. This gained for her the personal friendship of Locke and of Lady Masham, and was, through them, the means of introducing her to many eminent persons, among them being Mr. Peter King, then a barrister and member of parliament, who was the maternal nephew of Locke. Religious conversions =Roman Catholic Church= Considering the position and connections of her parents, it is probable that Trotter had not been trained at an early age to piety, and consequently when a crisis of the soul occurred, she probably met with a Roman Catholic teacher, and, as a natural result, she zealously adopted his creed. In this she continued for many years, resting quiescently upon its first impressions. Meanwhile, her strict observance of the fast-days proved so injurious to her health, that in October, 1703, her friend and physician, Dr. Denton Nicholas, wrote her a letter of serious remonstrance upon the subject, and desired her ‚Äúto abate of those rigours of abstinence, as insupportable to a constitution naturally infirm,‚Äù requesting that his opinion might be communicated to her friends and to her confessor. Her health, even at its best, was too delicate to allow her to walk more than a mile to church and back, on a summer's day, without fatigue which amounted to illness; and a weakness of sight always rendered it painful to her to write by candlelight. Yet this fragile woman possessed self-relying energy which enabled her not only to sustain the mental and manual labour of careful literary composition through continuous months and years, but also to transact with methodical exactness all the complicated business attendant upon the performance, printing, and publication of her works. From 1701, until her marriage in 1708, Catherine Trotter kept up a regular correspondence with her friend George Burnet, Esq., of Kemnay. During the greater part of the period he traveled in foreign lands, and more especially at the courts of Berlin and Hanover, where be spread the fame of ‚Äúla nouvelle Sappho-Ecossoise,‚Äù and excited the curiosity of Leibnitz to become acquainted with her philosophical works. It may be inferred from many passages in his letters that he would gladly have raised for himself an amorous interest with this young friend; and from hers, that, with unaffected candour and cordial esteem, she repelled every approach towards a declaration of love. She had many admirers, but never was led by the persuasions of her friends, or the temptations of wealth and rank, to encourage the addresses of men for whom she felt no preference. In 1704, Trotter composed a poem on the Duke of Marlborough's gaining the battle of Blenheim, which, being highly approved of by the hero and his family, was put into print. About that period she had some hopes of obtaining, through the powerful interest of the Marlborough family, a pension from the crown, to which her father's long services and losses in the cause of his King and country gave a plausible claim. This, however, she failed to obtain, and received only a gratuity. After the battle of Ramilies, in 1706, she produced another poem in praise of the Duke of Marlborough, and on both occasions her verses were ranked among the best which recorded his fame. In the same year, her tragedy, called The Revolution of Sweden, founded on Vertot's account of Gustavus Ericson, was performed at the Queen's Theatre in the Haymarket; and subsequently printed, with a dedication to Lady Harriet Godolphin, eldest daughter of the great Duke, and after his decease Duchess of Marlborough in her own right. Her sister, Mrs. Inglis, residing at Salisbury, and her mother spending much of her time there, Catherine was induced to make long visits to that city, extending sometimes to the period of fifteen months. But her favourite abode was at ‚ÄúMr. Finney‚Äôs, in Beaufort Buildings on the Strand,‚Äù where, in private lodgings, she could, without domestic restraint or the disturbance of young children, give herself up to literary occupations. Among the happy results of her sojournings at Salisbury was her acquaintance with Bishop Gilbert Burnet, and with his third wife, Elizabeth, eldest daughter of Sir Richard Blake, and widow of Robert Berkeley, Esq, of Spetchley. Mrs. Burnet, who had a large, independent income, took an affectionate interest in Trotter until Mrs. Burnet died in 1709. =Return to the Church of England= In Trotter's mind a sense of duty towards God, and a desire to reform and benefit the world, were ever predominant; but at different periods of her life she sought to effect this object by different means. In the year 1707, after a course of severe study, deep reflection, and earnest prayer, she abjured the Roman Catholic faith, and wrote and published her Two Letters concerning a Guide in Controversies, to which a preface by Bishop Burnet was prefixed. The first letter was addressed to Mr. Bennet, a priest, and the second to Mr. Harman, as a rejoinder to an answer which she had received. She made strong, clear and reasoned arguments for her change of faith. No scruple ever again affected her staunch adherence to the orthodox faith of the Church of England. Reverend Cockburn In the summer of 1707, while staying with Madame de Vere, an invalid who resided at Ockham Mills, near Ripley, Surrey, she met with a young clergyman named Fenn, of whose preaching, conversation, and character, she thoroughly approved. Mr. Fenn fell deeply in love with her, made her an offer of marriage, and obtained for his suit the sanction and intercession of Lady Piers. Catherine Trotter accepted his friendship, and, but for the preference she already felt for another person, would have judged it right to marry him. The favoured rival was Rev. Patrick Cockburn, a scholar and a gentleman, distantly related to the Burnet family and to her own, with whom she had for some months held a friendly correspondence, in which they discussed those subjects of philosophical and practical religion which were of principal interest to both. The addresses of Mr. Fenn brought mutual conviction, and matters came to a climax. =Pause in writing= Rev. Cockburn confessed his love, proposed, and was accepted. He took holy orders in the Church of England in 1708, married Trotter, received the ‚ÄúDonative‚Äù of Nayland, near Colchester, and, leaving his bride in London to arrange her affairs and to purchase furniture, he took possession of his pastoral charge in June, and welcomed her to their new home in the autumn of the same year. How long they resided there, neither Dr. Birch nor Trotters's writings suggest; but, in the course of time, Rev. Cockburn accepted the curacy of St. Dunstan's Church, Fleet-street, and returned with his family to London, where they resided until the year 1714, when the death of Queen Anne took place. The oath of abjuration required on the accession of King George I. aroused scruples in the mind of Rev. Cockburn, and he refused to take it, although he conscientiously offered up the public prayers for the reigning sovereign and the royal family. He was consequently deprived of his employment in the church, and reduced to poverty. During the next twelve years, he maintained his family by teaching Latin to the students of the Academy in Chancery Lane, while his wife, ever anxious for self-improvement, took up household duties, industriously applied herself to needlework, and all sorts of manual occupations, and cheerfully devoted her faculties to the solace of her husband, and to the education of her children. =Return to writing= From the year of her marriage, 1708, until 1724, Trotter had published nothing. In the latter year, she wrote her \\"Letter to Dr. Holdsworth\\", and having sent it to him, and received an elaborate controversial answer, she published her \\"Letter\\" in January, 1727. To this, Dr. Winch Holdsworth publicly replied, and Trotter wrote an able rejoinder; but the booksellers not being willing to undertake its responsibility, the \\"Vindication of Mr. Locke‚Äôs Christian Principles from the injurious imputations of Dr. Holdsworth\\", remained in manuscript until it was published among her collected works. The best of her productions in verse was \\"A Poem, occasioned by the Busts set up in the Queen‚Äôs Hermitage, designed to be presented with a book in vindication of Mr. Locke, which was to have been inscribed to Her Majesty\\". With considerable skill and persuasive sweetness she drew an argument from the honour done by Queen Caroline to the busts of Clarke, Locke, and Newton, and the patronage which Her Majesty had extended even to the rural bard, Nicholas Duck. Although much has been said and written about Locke by the ablest metaphysicians of his age, and of each succeeding generation, it may be questioned whether his own meaning in his own words has ever been more truly construed than by Trotter. What she wrote concerning his opinions during his life was approved by Locke himself; what she wrote of them after his decease was acknowledged to be correct by his most intimate associates, to whom he had frequently and familiarly expounded them. In 1726, Rev. Cockburn convinced himself of the propriety of taking the Oath of Abjuration upon the ascension of George I, to which he had so long objected. He was appointed to St. Paul's Chapel in Aberdeen in the following year. Thither he was accompanied by his family; and his wife bade, in that year, an everlasting farewell to London, the scene of her many triumphs and many trials. Soon after their removal, her friend, the Lord High Chancellor King, presented her husband to the living of Long Horseley, near Morpeth, in the county of Northumberland; but they continued at Aberdeen until the year 1737, when the Bishop of Durham ordered him to take up his residence in his parish. The clerical residence stood so far from the church of Long Horseley, that when rough weather and feeble health disabled Trotter from riding on horseback to attend the Sunday services, she was constrained to stay at home, unless a still more distant neighbor, Mrs. Ogle, chanced to be in the country, and to give her a seat in her chaise and four, or her coach and six. In 1732, while living at Aberdeen, she wrote the \\"Verses occasioned by the Busts in the Queen‚Äôs Hermitage\\", which were printed in the Gentleman‚Äôs Magazine for May 1737. In August, 1743, her \\"Remarks upon some Writers in the Controversy concerning the Foundation of Moral Duty and Obligation\\" were published in a serial called \\"The History of the Works of the Learned\\". These ‚Äò\\"Remarks\\" were well received, and excited great admiration, and Trotter's friend, Dr. Sharp, archdeacon of Northumberland, having read them in manuscript, engaged her in an epistolary discussion on the subject of which they treat. The correspondence began August 8, 1743, and was concluded October 2, 1747. Dr. Rutherford's \\"Essay on the Nature and Obligations of Virtue\\" having appeared in 1744, her active mind was again aroused for public controversy, and in April 1747, her \\"Remarks upon the Principles and Reasonings of Dr. Rutherford‚Äôs Essay on the Nature and Obligations of Virtue, in Vindication of the contrary Principles and Beasonings enforced in the Writings of the late Dr. Samuel Clarke\\", were published with a preface by Bishop Warburton. The extraordinary reputation acquired by this able work, suggested to some friends, who submitted the scheme to Lady Isabella Finch, the thought of raising a subscription for the republication of all Trotter's works, which the author herself undertook to edit. This plan was zealously supported by Trotter's fashionable and eminent friends, but uncontrollable circumstances prevented its full execution. Style and themes In some verses entitled \\"Calliope‚Äôs Directions how to Deserve and Distinguish the Muse‚Äôs Inspirations\\", the strong, clear sense of Trotter is conspicuously shown by her definition of the uses of tragic, comic, and satiric poetry. Of course, as Calliope, she presided only over heroic strains and general eloquence, and it would have been inappropriate to treat of any other kind of verse. The quotation of a few lines demonstrates the style:‚Äî Trotter's long suspension from writing -sixteen to eighteen years- was noted by the public, as was her resumption of writing. The commentators upon her works over-restrained her own words on the first part of this subject, and drawn from them an unwarranted inference. It should be understood that during those years, Trotter read few new books, yet she had undoubtedly possessed her Bible, the works of Shakespeare and Milton, of Lord Bacon, Cudworth, and Bishop Cumberland. She had lived so long in the propulsive centre of British activity that, when sunk into obscurity, the gathering in of her reflections enriched her more than continued opportunities of observation would have done; and her fine faculties were kept bright and keenly edged by constant use. Extracts of her controversial writings show her style. In the preface to her \\"Letter to Dr. Holdsworth\\", Trotter said the following, with the person here alluded to probably being Lord King:‚Äî In a letter to her niece, dated ‚ÄúLong Horseley, September 29, 1748,‚Äù Trotter said:‚Äî It is interesting to know Trotter's opinion of the most illustrious of all her contemporaries, Bishop Butler. In letters to Mrs. Arbuthnot, written at Aberdeen, in 1738, she thus mentions him:‚Äî In letters of subsequent date, Mrs. Cockburn repeatedly mentioned Bishop Butler with a still deeper sense of the value of his writings. Dating from ‚ÄúLong Horseley, October 2, 1747,‚Äù and again addressing Mrs. Arbuthnot, she said the following, which was an all-sufficient exposition of Trotter's theological opinions:‚Äî Personal life Mr. and Mrs. Cockburn had three daughters, Mary, Catherine, and Grissel, and one son, John. A letter of advice to the former, written by his mother for his guidance in early manhood, is full of wisdom and piety. Religion, employment, and women, are the subjects of her discourse. Under the second she says :‚Äî‚Äú Divinity is the profession you have been designed for from your birth; but let no views determine your choice to that sacred calling but a sincere desire of promoting the glory of God, and the salvation of men.‚Äù In subsequent letters to her niece, Mrs. Arbuthnot, Trotter often alludes to her ‚Äúgood son‚Äù with all the satisfaction of a happy mother. In 1743, a daughter died; and in January, 1749, her husband did as well. Under this severe shock, her feeble health gave way. Trotter died at Longhorsley near Morpeth on 11 May 1749. She was buried beside her husband and her youngest daughter, at Longhorsley, and on their tomb was inscribed one sentence, altered from Proverbs xxxi. 31, ‚ÄúLet their own works praise them in the gates.‚Äù Legacy Despite her one-time renown, Trotter's reputation has steadily waned over the last three centuries and has only been rescued from near obscurity by the efforts of feminist critics, such as Anne Kelley,See Catharine Trotter: an early modern writer in the vanguard of feminism, Aldershot: Ashgate, 2002 in the last two decades. Arguably, the predicament of her reputation is attributable to her having written a large amount of work very early in her life and less in her mature years. In other words, her career was extremely front-loaded, and the literati of her period (especially the men) tended to focus on her youth and beauty at the expense of her work. Some literary historians attribute her relative obscurity to a persistent emphasis being placed upon her philosophical work at the expense of her creative writing (especially by her biographer Thomas Birch, who included only one play in his two volume collection of her work and did not mention Olinda's Adventures at all). Though skillful, her philosophical writings were sometimes dismissed as derivative, especially her defence of Locke's Essay‚Äîa judgment that could hardly help her reputation. Much of the scholarly interest in Trotter's dramatic writing now centres on gender studies. Indeed, Trotter herself was cognizant of the limitations her gender placed upon her and often voiced her protest in writing. In the dedication to Fatal Friendship (1698), for example, she remarks that \\"when a Woman appears in the World under any distinguishing Character, she must expect to be the mark of ill Nature,\\" especially if she enters into \\"what the other Sex think their peculiar Prerogative.\\" Both Trotter's literary works, in which women dominate the action, and her personal life provide rich subject matter for feminist criticism.

Overview The BGM-109G was developed as a counter to the mobile MRBM and IRBM nuclear missiles (SS-20 Saber) deployed by the Soviet Union in Eastern Bloc European countries. The GLCM and the U.S. Army's Pershing II may have been the incentives that fostered Soviet willingness to sign the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF treaty), and thus possibly reduced the threat of nuclear wars in Europe. GLCM is also a generic term for any ground-launched cruise missile. Since the U.S. deployed only one modern cruise missile in the tactical role, the GLCM name stuck. The GLCM was built by General Dynamics. History =Design and employment= A conventionally configured cruise missile, the BGM-109 was essentially a small, pilotless flying machine, powered by a turbofan engine. Unlike ballistic missiles, whose aimpoint is usually determined by gravitic trajectories, a cruise missile is capable of complicated aerial manoeuvres, and can fly a range of predetermined flight plans. Also, it flies at much lower altitudes than a ballistic missile, typically with a terrain-hugging flight plan. The trade-off for this low- observability flight is strike time; cruise missiles travel far more slowly than a ballistic weapon, and the GLCM was typical in this regard. National Museum of US Air Force. GLCM was developed as a ground-launched variant of the Tomahawk missile in use by the U.S. Navy (along with an undeveloped air- launched version, the Medium Range Air to Surface Missile (MRASM)) Unlike other variants of the Tomahawk, the GLCM carried only a W84 thermonuclear warhead; no conventional capability was provided. The W84 warhead is a 0.2‚Äì150kt variable-yield weapon. This yield contrasts with the yield of the W80 warhead found on other versions of the Tomahawk and on the ALCM from which the W84 was derived, which has a selectable yield of 5 or 150 kt.. The Pentagon credited the GLCM with a range of 2000‚Äì2500 kilometers. Like other U.S. cruise missiles of this period, accuracy after more than 2000 km of flight was approximately 30 meters. The missile was entirely subsonic, powered by a turbofan engine with a rocket booster assisting at launch. Militarily, the GLCM was targeted against fixed targets‚Äîat the outer edge of its range, the missile's flight time with its subsonic turbofan was more than 2¬Ω hours. The missiles were launched from an elevated launcher, with the missile ejected from its canister for about 13 seconds of solid rocket booster flight. The fins extended at 4 seconds, the air inlet and wings deployed at 10 seconds and the jet engine started at the end of the boost phase. Flying at low level, the missile was guided by TERCOM (terrain contour matching) to the target. This contrasted strongly with Pershing II, which had a flight time of 10‚Äì15 minutes. However, the range of the GLCM gave it the ability to strike deep within then-Soviet territory, and the missile guidance and low radar cross- section would have made it far more difficult to intercept a GLCM even if the launch were detected in time. BGM-109G personnel were trained at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona, by the 868th Tactical Missile Training Squadron from 1 July 1981. On 1 October 1985, the squadron became part of the 868th Tactical Missile Training Group. The group and squadron were inactivated on 31 May 1990. An area near Fort Huachuca, Arizona was used for field training for GLCM flights. GLCM testing was conducted at the Dugway Proving Ground in Utah, with many of the people involved in the testing going to operational wings as they were activated. =NATO deployment and protests= Ground Launched Cruise Missile GAMA (GLCM Alert and Maintenance Area) GAMAs at RAF Molesworth, England. 4 GAMAs, 1 per flight, each holding 16 missiles, total 64 missiles. Molesworth was completely reconstructed between 1981 and 1985, being transformed from a largely abandoned World War II Eighth Air Force B-17 base to a modern NATO facility. The large World War II \\"J\\" type hangar in the upper left was retained as a memorial to the World War II 303d Bombardment Group. Both Bob Hope and Glenn Miller performed USO shows in that hangar during the war years. A dispersed launch site for a BGM-109G Gryphon missile TEL A Soviet inspector examines a BGM-109G ground-launched cruise missile in 1988 prior to its destruction. BGM-109G missiles would be based at six locations throughout Europe; in the United Kingdom (at RAF Greenham Common and RAF Molesworth), Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, and Comiso Air Station in Italy. Each location had its own unique problems, but all required extensive construction by the USAF. Initial operating capability (IOC) occurred in 1983.General Dynamics/McDonnell Douglas BGM-109G \\"Gryphon\\" Ground-launched Cruise Missile Normal basing was in blast shelters at military installations. Each BGM-109G station was controlled by a Wing that consisted of a Tactical Missile Squadron (TMS), which was responsible for operation and deployment of the missiles; and a Tactical Missile Maintenance Squadron (TMMS), which was responsible for the support of the system. Each TMS consisted of several flights, made up of 69 people and 22 vehicles. The missile was designed to operate in a flight with sixteen missiles. The flight would be normally on base, with the missiles and vehicles secured in the hardened storage area called the GAMA (GLCM Alert and Maintenance Area). Four transporter erector launchers (TEL) each carried four BGM-109G missiles in their containers and ready for launch. Two launch control centers (LCC), each with two launch officers, were connected to the TELs and interconnected for launch. Each TEL and LCC was towed by a large MAN KAT1 8x8 tractor and was capable of traversing rough terrain. There were 16 support vehicles for the flight commander, normally a captain, 19 maintenance technicians, a medical technician and 44 security personnel. During periods of increased tension, the flights would be deployed to pre-surveyed, classified locations in the countryside away from the base. The members of the flight would dig in, erect camouflage netting to hide the vehicles, and prepare for launch. Flight commanders were tasked to survey and select possible deployment sites, with all details closely held, and the commander selected the location preferred when the flight deployed from the base. When deployed, the flight was self-sustaining, and secured with special intrusion detection radar. The launchers (sans warheads) were sent out on a number of simulated scrambles. Although deployed in the face of a range of Soviet IRBMs, including the brand- new and extremely capable SS-20 Saber, the GLCM (sometimes referred to by its phonetic nickname, Glick-em) faced widespread public protest in Europe. Anti- nuclear groups such as the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament felt that the United States was deploying weapons meant to win a tactical nuclear war, without adequate consideration of the effects that even a 'victory' would bring. Critics also argued that the Reagan Administration was unduly escalating tensions in Central Europe. Between them, GLCM and Pershing II made a lethal combination. GLCM missiles could be launched, undetected, followed 2 hours later by a Pershing strike, which would fly so quickly that it was possible no response could be made before the Pershings struck. Aside from presenting a course of action to NATO commanders in the event of war, it put the Kremlin leaders (in range of the GLCM and possibly the Pershing, even in Moscow) in a position of fearing a decapitating NATO first strike, which could have moved them toward a launch on warning policy as the only way to maintain mutually assured destruction. However, the USSR did have submarine-launched missiles (i.e. Golf and Hotel class SSBNs armed with R-27 Zyb and SS-N-5s) available during this time, so any fears of a decapitating first strike were not necessarily justified. =Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty= Despite initial fears of greater instability, the deployment of GLCM ultimately caused Soviet leaders to enter into negotiations for, and finally signature of, the INF treaty. The recognition by Soviet leaders of the threat posed by the GLCM and Pershing II missiles made them far more inclined to agree to negotiate their own intermediate-range weapons, especially the SS-20, out of service, in exchange for the elimination of the threat posed by the GLCM and the Pershing II. Unlike SALT II or START I, which set limits to maximum nuclear arsenals, the INF Treaty banned whole categories of intermediate-range tactical nuclear weapons outright. All ground-launched cruise missiles and ballistic missiles with ranges greater than 500 but less than 5500 kilometers were barred to the U.S. and USSR under this treaty. This meant the withdrawal of GLCM and Pershing II on the American side. The Soviets withdrew the GLCM's most direct counterpart, the SSC-4 or RK-55, and its supersonic follow-on, the SSC-X-5. In addition, various Soviet MRBMs, IRBMs, and LRBMs were withdrawn: the SS-4 Sandal, SS-5 Skean, SS-12 Scaleboard, SS-20 Saber, SS-22 Scaleboard B, and SS-23 Spider. All of these equivalent weapons had been developed and deployed against NATO forces before the introduction of the GLCM, despite the categorization of the GLCM deployment by communists as 'aggressive'. GLCM was removed from Europe beginning in 1988, and over the next three and a half years all units were transported to Davis Monthan AFB and destroyed or converted into displays by 1991. Eight missiles survive for inert static display only. In February 2018, U.S. military officials confirmed they were developing a new ground-launched, intermediate-range cruise missile to counter Russian development of a similar weapon system that violates the INF Treaty.Pentagon Confirms It‚Äôs Developing Nuclear Cruise Missile to Counter a Similar Russian One.

He was a political prisoner during the Franco era. In his youth, Garc√≠a became affiliated with libertarianism and his family belonged to the Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT). As a young newsboy, after being hurt at a rally for greater pay, he left Barcelona for France, where he learned the language. During the Spanish Civil War, he drove arms across the French border into Republican Spain. While his fellow Barcelonans confronted a government building, Garc√≠a led a cohort to raid gunshops in the wealthier part of the city. During the war, he fought on the Saragossa and Madrid fronts, and after the anarchists' defeat, spent two and a half years in a concentration camp where he befriended Josep Llu√≠s i Facerias and El Quico. Upon their release, they together joined the Spanish Resistance, in which they reorganized the CNT, smuggled guns and people across borders, and sabotaged Franco and the Axis. Garc√≠a was among the few who survived. Garc√≠a was captured in 1949 and sentenced to death, but international pressure led his sentence to be reduced to 20 years in prison. He met Stuart Christie in the Carabanchel Prison. After his release and exile in 1969 Garc√≠a wrote about his incarceration in Franco's Prisoner (1971). Reviews compared his autobiography to In Hiding, written by a socialist mayor who opposed anarchists. Garc√≠a's book was translated into German. Garc√≠a became fluent in Italian and learned rudimentary English in prison so as to read the English-language press. He decided to travel across Western Europe to speak against Francoist Spain and organize wider resistance. In London, in the mid-1970s Garcia was running the Centro Iberico at Chalk Farm (later in Holborn and, after his death, on the Harrow Road, Notting Hill), a meeting place for sympathetic exiles and anarchists exiles. Through the Anarchist Black Cross, which published Black Flag, Miguel helped raise funds for Spanish prisoners and their families. He worked with Albert Meltzer who wrote of Garc√≠a's influence on The Angry Brigade, the First of May Group, and the Iberian Liberation Movement, among other groups internationally.

Over 1250 poems related to the love of Radha and Krishna in Bengali with the bhanita of Chandidas are found with three different sobriquets along with his name, ', Dvija and Dina as well as without any sobriquet also. It is not clear whether these bhanitas actually refer to the same person or not. It is assumed by some modern scholars that the poems which are current in the name of Chandidas are actually the works of at least four different Chandidas, who are distinguished from each other by their sobriquets found in the bhanitas. It is also assumed that the earliest of them was Ananta Chandidas, who has been more or less identified as a historical figure born in the 14th century in Birbhum district of the present-day West Bengal state and wrote the lyrical Srikrishna Kirtan (Songs in praise of Krishna). Srikrishna Kirtan In 1916, the Bangiya Sahitya Parishad published the manuscript of the Srikrishna Kirtan discovered by Basanta Ranjan Roy Bidwatballabh at Bankura. The Srikrishna Kirtan, as its name suggests, narrates the story of Krishna and his companion Radha. The storyline is derived from Shrimad Bhagavatam. However, Baru Chandidas managed to add substantial originality, making it a masterpiece of medieval Bengali literature. He gives the yearning of Radha a distinctly Bengali rendition, and in the process captures much of the social conditions of the day. As such he is considered to be a prominent Early Middle Bengal poet, however the date of his poem Srikrsnakirtana is still under question, while the text remains one of the most important evidences of early portrayal of the popular story of \\"Lord Krishna's love for the cowherd girl Radha\\". The 412 songs of Srikrsnakirtana are divided into thirteen sections that represent the core of the Radha-Krsna legendary cycle, with many variants providing excellent comparative material. The manuscript clearly suggests that the songs meant to be song, and implies particular ragas for the recitation. There is a considerable debate as to the authenticity of the text that has significant religious meaning. Humanism According to Banglapedia, Chandidas was the first Bengali-language poet to be a humanist. He asserted \\"Shobar upor manush shotto tahar upore nai\\" (\\"Above all is humanity, none else\\"). Later literature has also often eulogized Chandidas' love for a Rajakini (a female cloth washer), whether this has any historical basis is not known.

Jean-√âtienne Montucla (5 September 1725 ‚Äì 18 December 1799) was a French mathematician and historian. Montucla was born at Lyon, France. In 1754 he published an anonymous treatise on quadrature, Histoire des recherches sur la quadrature du cercle.J. Montucla (1873) History of the Quadrature of the Circle, J. Babin translator, William Alexander Myers editor, link from HathiTrust Montucla's deep interest in history of mathematics became apparent with his publication of Histoire des Math√©matiques, the first part appearing in 1758. According to George Sarton, the Histoire is :a history of the mathematical sciences, and might almost be called a history of science from the mathematical angle, even as many histories of medicine are to some extent histories of science written from the medical angle.George Sarton (1936) Jean-Etienne Montucla (1725‚Äì1799). His Life and Works, Osiris 1: 519‚Äì67 He was appointed intendant-secretary of Grenoble in 1758, secretary to the expedition for colonizing Cayenne in 1764, and chief architect and censor-royal for mathematical books in 1765. In 1778 he re- edited Jacques Ozanam's Recreations math√©matiques, afterwards published in English by Charles Hutton (4 vols, London, 1803). The French Revolution deprived him of his income and left him in great destitution. The offer in 1795 of a mathematical chair in one of the schools of Paris was declined on account of his infirm health. He was still in straitened circumstances in 1798, when he published a second edition of the first part of his Histoire. After his death, his Histoire was completed by J√©r√¥me Lalande, and published at Paris in 1799‚Äì1802 (4 vols). Ivor Grattan-Guinness described the Histoire as a milestone: :His first volume covered Greek, Roman, and Eastern traditions, while the second covered geometry, mechanics and optics up to the seventeenth century. Forty years later the second edition began to appear, although the author then died and task of completion fell to J√©r√¥me Lalande. With the help of various colleagues, he completed the third volume and wrote the fourth within four years. The first two volumes covered the same material as before, while the other two handled all aspects of the eighteenth century; the whole encompassed around 3000 pages, including indexes (themselves an excellent feature)...One curious feature of the work, especially in chapters on applied mathematics, is the lack of mathematical symbolism in the text: Montucla and Lalande were often content with a verbal account of the work without entering into symbolic renderings. Of course many basic aspects of the history of mathematics were thus left out.Ivor Grattan-Guinness (1994) Companion Encyclopedia of the History and Philosophy of the Mathematical Sciences, volume 2, page 1666, Routledge References * External links * Category:1725 births Category:1799 deaths Category:People from Lyon Category:18th-century French mathematicians Category:Members of the French Academy of Sciences Category:Historians of mathematics ","title":"Jean-√âtienne Montucla"},{"id":"2157801","text":"A Lolo Ball, also known as a POGO BAL, Springbal, Lolobal, Disc-O, Pogo ball, or Pogo-It, is a toy.

From there boats carried the heavy stone to Charlestown for construction of the Bunker Hill Monument. The Granite Railway is popularly termed the first commercial railroad in the United States, as it was the first chartered railway to evolve into a common carrier without an intervening closure. The last active quarry closed in 1963; in 1985, the Metropolitan District Commission purchased , including Granite Railway Quarry, as the Quincy Quarries Reservation. History In 1825, after an exhaustive search throughout New England, Solomon Willard selected the Quincy site as the source of stone for the Bunker Hill Monument. After many delays and much obstruction, the railway itself was granted a charter on March 4, 1826, with right of eminent domain to establish its right-of-way. Businessman and state legislator Thomas Handasyd Perkins organized the financing of the new Granite Railway Company, owning a majority of its shares, and he was designated its president. The railroad was designed and built by railway pioneer Gridley Bryant and began operations on October 7, 1826. Bryant used developments that had already been in use on the railroads in England, but he modified his design to allow for heavier, more concentrated loads and a three-foot frost line. The railway ran from quarries to the Neponset River. Its wagons had wheels in diameter and were pulled by horses, although steam locomotives had been in operation in England for 13 years. The wooden rails were plated with iron and were laid apart, on stone crossties spaced at 8-foot intervals. By 1837 these wooden rails had been replaced by granite rails, once again capped with iron.Wood, Frederick J. The Turnpikes of New England. Marshall Jones Company, Boston, 1919, p. 208. In 1830, a new section of the railway called the Incline was added to haul granite from the Pine Ledge Quarry to the railway level below. Wagons moved up and down the long incline in an endless conveyor belt. The incline continued in operation until the 1940s. The railway introduced several important inventions, including railway switches or frogs, the turntable, and double-truck railroad cars. Gridley Bryant never patented his inventions, believing they should be for the benefit of all. The novelty of the new railroad attracted tourists who journeyed out from Boston to witness the revolutionary technology in person. Notable visitors such as statesman Daniel Webster and English actress Fanny Kemble were early witnesses to the new railway. Miss Kemble described her 1833 visit in her journal. The Granite Railway was the site of one of the first fatal railway accidents in the United States, on July 25, 1832, when the wagon containing Thomas B. Achuas, of Cuba, derailed as he and three other tourists were taking a tour. The accident occurred while the wagon‚Äîempty of stone but now carrying the four passengers‚Äîwas ascending the Incline on its return trip and a cable broke. The occupants of the car were thrown over a cliff, approximately . Mr. Achuas was killed and the three other passengers were badly injured. In 1871 the Old Colony and Newport Railway took over the original right-of-way of the Granite Railway, replacing its track with contemporary construction, and steam trains then took granite from the quarries directly to Boston without need of barges from the Neponset River. This portion of the Old Colony Railroad through Quincy and Milton was later absorbed into the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad and later closed. During the early twentieth century, metal channels were laid over the old granite rails on the Incline and motor trucks were hauled up and down on a cable. Most of the right of way of the railway was eventually incorporated into much of the Southeast Expressway in Milton and Quincy. Preservation The railway's Incline was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 19, 1973, and a surviving portion of the railroad bed, just off the end of Bunker Hill Lane, was added on October 15, 1973. A centennial historic plaque from 1926, an original switch frog, a piece of train track, and a section of superstructure from the Granite Railway are in the gardens on top of the Southeast Expressway (Interstate 93) as it passes under East Milton Square. The frog had been displayed at the World's Columbian Exposition at Chicago in 1893. The commemorative display is at the approximate site of the railroad's right-of-way as it went through Milton on its way to the Neponset River. In Quincy, visitors can walk along several parkland trails that reveal vestiges of the original railway trestle and the Incline. These trails connect to the quarries, most of which are now filled for safety purposes with dirt from the massive Big Dig highway project in Boston. In years past, many persons were injured ‚Äî and some killed ‚Äî while diving into the flooded abandoned quarries from great heights. The Department of Conservation and Recreation maintains the Quincy Quarries Reservation, which has facilities for rock climbing, and trails connecting the remains of the Granite Railway.

Publication history Glorious Godfrey first appeared in Forever People #3 (June 1971) and was created by Jack Kirby. In 1971, an article in The New York Times Magazine about \\"relevant comics\\" described \\"a handsome toothy character named Glorious Godfrey, a revivalist. Godfrey is drawn to look like an actor playing Billy Graham in a Hollywood film biography of Richard Nixon starring George Hamilton.\\" The character was intended to embody the powerful, charismatic speaker who could talk people into justifying violence and evil. Fictional character biography Godfrey has a sister named Amazing Grace who is also a member of Darkseid's Elite. The siblings have similar powers. Whereas Amazing Grace's specialty is manipulation, Godfrey's is persuasion. In his first appearance he confronts the Forever People, who had stumbled upon a recruitment program for Earth-based warriors for Darkseid. He personally leads an attack of Justifiers that almost kills the young warrior Serafin. Despite the efforts of the Forever People's semi-sentient Super-Cycle, Godfrey's attack would have succeeded in killing Serafin; however, Highfather chose at that moment to recall all his people (and the cycle) home via teleportation.\\"Forever People\\" Vol. 1 #6-7 (Feb-March 1972) Godfrey remained a relatively unimportant character until 1986 (he had a total of three appearances over a decade and a half), when Legends (the first crossover since the Crisis on Infinite Earths) was published. In it, Darkseid attempts to deprive the world of its heroes, not only so that they would be ineffective against Darkseid, but also in the hopes that the people of Earth would more willingly surrender to his rule. John Byrne The first phase of the plan consists simply of creating immense amounts of collateral damage by sending creatures to Earth to fight the superheroes. The public begins to resent the heroes in their midst, and therefore Darkseid starts the second phase of his plan by sending the master manipulator Glorious Godfrey to Earth. Assuming the identity of G. Gordon Godfrey (a reference to G. Gordon Liddy), he starts a hate campaign against the superheroes that proves to be very effective, riling the public and ultimately leading to a presidential decision to outlaw any super-heroic activity. The final phase of the plan consists of the Apokoliptian warhounds, cybernetic creatures that are bonded to human hosts, for which Godfrey is able to find an ample number of 'volunteers' among his hypnotized public. He leads his charges to Washington D.C., only to be confronted by a cadre of assembled heroes. The heroes are able to defeat the Warhounds and separate them from their human hosts, with Godfrey jeopardising his image when he strikes a little girl who had been standing between the heroes and Godfrey's group of adults. After his initial weak attempt to justify his attack fails, Godfrey makes one last ploy by putting on the helmet of Doctor Fate in the hopes of obtaining his awesome might. Instead, the helmet mindwipes Godfrey, leaving him nothing more than an empty shell. He is sent to Belle Reve sanitarium, which he would later be broken out of by the Female Furies under the order of Darkseid. Godfrey has subsequently made brief appearances among assemblages of all the Apokoliptian Gods. =Final Crisis= In Final Crisis #1, Reverend Godfrey Good appears on a TV news report, decrying the situation in Bl√ºdhaven and the lack of government aid and assistance in dealing with the crisis in the ruined city.Final Crisis #1 In between Final Crisis #1 and #2, Good is captured and transformed into a host for the essence of Glorious Godfrey. Godfrey taunts Dan Turpin and Batman, as Batman is imprisoned and Turpin transformed into the final host body for Darkseid. In Final Crisis #4, Godfrey is present when Darkseid takes control over Turpin's body. However, in Final Crisis #5, Darkseid responds to his minion's impending death (presumably due to the fact that Godfrey's host body was not modified to successfully contain Godfrey's dark essence) by watching them die in front of him.Final Crisis #5 (2008) A one-shot revealed that Godfrey had been chosen by Darkseid to be the secretive, personal assistant to the Earth-based villain Libra. The man is given generic technology to support him throughout the years because Darkseid believed the man had potential for greatness. Godfrey's assistance turns out to be invaluable, as Libra is the key to Darkseid's defeat of Earth.\\"Final Crisis: Secret Files and Origins\\" December 2008 =The New 52= In The New 52 (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Glorious Godfrey makes his first appearance by giving greetings to Batman and Ra's al Ghul from Apokolips. He has a new look, sporting a beard and an all-black uniform with red gloves and belt.Batman and Ra's al Ghul #32 (2014) Glorious Godfrey's reason for coming to Earth is to retrieve the Chaos Shard, a powerful crystal which once belonged to Darkseid which Ra's al Ghul revealed was hidden inside the sarcophagus he crafted for Damian. After detecting a trace signature of the shard coming from inside Damian's body, and despite the assistance of the Justice League, Glorious Godfrey escapes with the corpse back to Apokolips, with Batman vowing to get Damian Wayne's corpse back.Batman and Ra's al Ghul #33 (2014) Powers and abilities Glorious Godfrey retains several attributes of a native of Apokolips, such as a limited level of superhuman strength, endurance and invulnerability. In addition, Godfrey has extended lifespan which allows him to exist indefinitely and he has an advanced immune system. However, Glorious Godfrey is a sub-par athlete and hand-to-hand combatant, whose greatest gifts are his overwhelming speaking voice and his extraordinary powers of persuasion. Whether these are natural gifts or have been augmented by the power of Darkseid has yet to be determined. Godfrey employs a private army called the Justifiers, composed of Earthmen who believe Godfrey's rhetoric and have had their perceptions completely contorted by Godfrey's words. The special helmets worn by the Justifiers allow Glorious Godfrey to control his soldiers even when they are not in his presence. Inspiration Jack Kirby biographer Mark Evanier states that Glorious Godfrey was based on evangelist Billy Graham. \\"A lesser villain who toiled in the service of Darkseid was inspired more directly by evangelist Billy Graham, who was then rather difficult to avoid on TV. Kirby was appalled at some of Graham's apocalyptic sermons which ‚Äî to Jack ‚Äî were more calculated to instill fear than faith, and to stampede people into service of Graham's causes. Jack called the foe Glorious Godfrey, the name being a Kirbyesque pun. The comic book evangelist was \\"god-free\\" and also had some of the traits of TV pitchman Arthur Godfrey, though the main reference and the visual came from Billy Graham. Not evident in on the pages he drew was Jack's belief ‚Äî which he expressed on several occasions ‚Äî that Graham and the president he counseled were both virulent anti-Semites.\\" In other media =Television= * A different version of Glorious Godfrey appeared in the Justice League animated series. This version had blonde hair, rather than the comic version's orange. In the two-part episode \\"Eclipsed\\", \\"Glorious\\" G. Gordon Godfrey (voiced by Enrico Colantoni) is the host of a sensationalist talk show which he uses to attack the Justice League's credibility with hypocritical questions and things not related like how 50 percent of marriages end in divorce and the other percent in death. (His fans are simpletons who believe everything he says, given the relatively empty studio.) When Flash goes on his show to explain the League is above greed and exploitation, G Gordon twists it to make it seem like Flash said the League thinks they're above everyone else. It is not revealed if he is connected with Darkseid or has his powers of persuasion; it appears that he is a normal human. In poetic justice, after the Justice League successfully prevented the destruction of the sun, his sponsors dropped him and the network moved his show to four o'clock in the morning. At one point on his talk show, Godfrey holds up a book called The Innocent Seduced and refers to its author, Dr. Frederic. This is a reference to Seduction of the Innocent, an actual book written by Fredric Wertham which had great influence during the early 1950s and accused comic books of corrupting minors. * Godfrey appears on the tenth and final season of Smallville, portrayed by Michael Daingerfield. Godfrey, who is a radio shock jock personality against vigilantes, superheroes, and illegal aliens, is heard on the radio in the episode \\"Shield\\" and appears in the subsequent episode, \\"Supergirl\\". He becomes a vessel for Darkseid since he had great darkness in his heart. Through him, he becomes a famous author for a best-selling anti-heroes book, trying to spread the seeds of mistrust and doubt through people's hearts and make the people lose faith in their heroes. Lois Lane, tired of watching him take cheap shots at heroes, follows him to Club Desaad to try to expose him, but Darkseid takes over and breaks out of his bonds while saying that taking over her body would have been \\"fun\\". Godfrey/Darkseid tortures Lois and says her suffering will bring the Blur to him and enjoys her \\"playful\\" torture. In the series finale, when Apokolips, the planet of Darkseid, descended to Earth, he, Granny Goodness, and Desaad had a meeting with the corrupted Oliver Queen. They gave him a gold Kryptonite wedding ring so he could remove Clark's powers permanently, leaving no one to stop Darkseid, but, unknown to them, Clark managed to remove Oliver's Omega symbol. As the final moments of Apopkolips' rapture approached, Oliver appeared to the prophets, now cleansed of their influence. Godfrey was shocked by this and the three tried to kill him, though before they could Oliver used his arrows to destroy them all. * Godfrey first appears in the Young Justice: Invasion episode \\"Happy New Year\\", voiced by Tim Curry in season two and by James Arnold Taylor in season three. He appears using the name G. Gordon Godfrey as in the comics, a news show host with a xenophobic and anti-alien agenda. Godfrey reports about the incident about Lobo's attack on Secretary-General Tseng which revealed that Tseng was a Krolotean in disguise, while sowing fears about other aliens being in the Justice League. In \\"Alienated\\", Godfrey commends the Justice League on their act of setting up technology that will detect alien life on Earth, yet is suspicious about how they managed to obtain the technology so quickly. As the episode progresses, other citizens are shown accepting Godfrey's ideologies. In \\"Depths\\", G. Gordon Godfrey questions Carol Ferris at a press conference about the idea of Ferris Aircraft launching a communication satellite to Mars, considering the recent alien attacks, and refuses to believe in any positive effects to the satellite launch. In \\"Before the Dawn\\", G. Gordon Godfrey comments about the Reach appearing at the United Nations wanting peace with Earth and states that at least they \\"used the front door\\" unlike the alien members of the Justice League. In \\"Cornered\\", G. Gordon Godfrey comments about Captain Atom and the Reach Ambassador meeting in private following their meeting at the United Nations. G. Gordon Godfrey later comments about the Reach Ambassador exposing the info about the Justice League's Watchtower. In \\"True Colors\\", G. Gordon Godfrey comments about the Justice League's Watchtower and asks the viewers how long the viewers can stand for this. He also says that the Reach have partnered with Lex Luthor to work on ways to end world hunger and other projects. In \\"The Hunt\\", G. Gordon Godfrey interviews the Reach Ambassador and questions him about the Reach ships that have been under Earth's oceans all this time. The Reach Ambassador tells G. Gordon Godfrey that they were there to help Blue Beetle as G. Gordon Godfrey asks if this is a part of the Reach's \\"bold-faced lies.\\" In \\"Endgame\\", G. Gordon Godfrey reports that Secretary- General Tseng has resigned and that Lex Luthor is a candidate to become the new Secretary-General after helping to stop the Reach invasion. Later, G. Gordon Godfrey is seen with Vandal Savage and Desaad on Apokolips when Vandal Savage meets with Darkseid. Later in Young Justice: Outsiders G. Gordon is seen still hosting his show, and openly criticizes his guest Gretchen Goode's VR Goggles and her efforts to stop metahuman trafficking. In \\"Elder Wisdom\\", in an interview with UN Secretary Lex Luthor, G. Gordon Godfrey unexpectedly deviates from their pre-arranged script to show up Luthor's verbal attacks against the Outsiders. Later in his makeup room, G. Gordon calls on Luthor's personal vendetta against the Outsiders, given that they had destroyed a spider-bot factory secretly owned by him, prompting Luthor to change tactics to \\"embrace and co-opt\\". =Film= G. Gordon Godfrey appears in the 2019 animated film Reign of the Supermen, voiced by Trevor Devall. This version of the character is an editorialist who is interviewed in the films opening montage about an article he has written saying that the people of Earth must be their own heroes instead of relying upon the titular characters who have risen in the wake of Superman's apparent death. This message implicitly inspires ordinary people who are both manipulated by Darkseid and who fight against him throughout the film. Godfrey does not reappear in the film, or the subsequent film featuring Darkseid's third invasion of Earth, implying that this incarnation of the character was not an agent of Apokolips.

He was born at Arnstadt, the son of Heinrich Bach, Johann Sebastian Bach's first cousin once removed and the first cousin of J.S. Bach's father, Johann Ambrosius Bach. He was also the uncle of Maria Barbara Bach, J. S. Bach's first wife and second cousin. Johann Christoph married Maria Elisabeth Wiedemann in 1667. They had seven children, including four sons who became musicians: Johann Nicolaus (10 October 1669 - 4 November 1753), Johann Christoph Jr. (29 August 1676 ‚Äì 1738), Johann Friedrich (1682‚Äì1730), and Johann Michael (1685‚Äìunknown). He is not to be confused with Johann Sebastian Bach's son, Johann Christoph Friedrich Bach. Johann Christoph had a reputation as a composer that was only equalled by that of Johann Sebastian within the Bach family during his lifetime. He was organist at Eisenach and later a member of the court chamber orchestra there. His brother, Johann Michael Bach (Johann Sebastian Bach's father-in-law and Maria Barbara's father), was also a composer. Some of the works were later attributed to Johann Sebastian, but were recently recognized as written by Johann Christoph. One of the most famous works is the cantata ', based on the Song of Solomon. Despite his success as a musician, Johann Christoph experienced financial difficulties, which may have resulted in his not having been selected as the guardian of Johann Sebastian when the latter's parents died. Yet Johann Christoph found the money to have his portrait painted in oil several times, including the well-known portrait of him that is on display in a Berlin museum. Johann Christoph was heavily in debt when he died at Eisenach. He died just ten days after his wife Maria died. Sebastian Bach described him in his Genealogy (, 1735) as \\"the profound composer\\", thus hinting at his reputation, not just within the family, but within society.

The term waterwolf is an example of zoomorphism, in which a non-living thing is given traits or characteristics of an animal (whereas a non-living thing given human traits or characteristics is personification). The traits of a wolf most commonly given to lakes include ‚Äúsomething to be feared‚Äù, ‚Äúquick and relentless‚Äù,‚Äù an enemy of man‚Äù. The Netherlands, meaning ‚Äúlow countries‚Äù, is a nation where 18% of the land is below sea level, and half of the land under one meter above sea level, and is prone to flooding. Before modern flood control, severe storms could cause flooding that could wipe out whole villages in the area of the waterwolf. Much of the land in the Netherlands is considered peat bogs. Peat is known to be an organic matter substance consisting of 10% carbon and 90% water and is usually found in colder climates where the plant growth and plant decay are slow. Peat is considered a carbon sequestration, and when dried can be burned as a fuel. Historically peat was the primary source of fuel in the Netherlands, and farmers would mine the peat to burn or sell, thus contributing to the erosion of the landscape. The first great step to reclaiming land taken by the waterwolf was made with the creation of windmills that could pump water out of the surrounding area, allowing for the creation of polders, or areas inhabited below sea level with an artificially managed water table. Modern flood control in the Netherlands consists of maintaining polders, levees, and is highlighted by the world's largest dam project: The Delta Works. While modern flood control has conquered the waterwolf, new events such as rising sea levels from climate change could once again bring the waterwolf.

Life Sima Hui was from Yangzhai County (), Yingchuan Commandery (), which is around present-day Yuzhou, Henan. He lived in northern Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan). He is popularly remembered as the one who recommended Zhuge Liang and Pang Tong to the warlord Liu Bei in the 14th- century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, even though historically it was his friend Pang Degong (ÈæêÂæ∑ÂÖ¨; Pang Tong's uncle) who did so. Sima Hui was known to never mention others' shortcomings or flaws. His reply to both good and bad news would always be \\"hao\\" (Â•Ω; literally \\"good\\" or \\"yes\\"). When someone asked him, \\"How are you?\\", he replied, \\"Good.\\" When somebody told him that their son had died, he said, \\"Very good.\\" His wife chided him for that, saying, \\"Everyone sees you as a person of good moral conduct so they are willing to share their problems with you. Why do you say 'very good' when someone tells you that his son had died?\\" Sima Hui replied, \\"It's also good to hear what you've just said.\\" This gave rise to the Chinese idiom haohao xiansheng (Â•ΩÂ•ΩÂÖàÁîü; literally \\"Mr. Yes\\" or \\"Mr. Good\\"). In Romance of the Three Kingdoms and popular culture In Chapter 37 of the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Sima Hui is described to be a carefree, wandering man who is well-versed in many arts. He has a close relationship with Pang Tong, and refers to Pang Tong as a younger brother. Sima Hui is also featured in Chan Mou's manhua The Ravages of Time as the teacher of the \\"Eight Enigmas\\", a group of elite strategists and advisers.

His title, Nawab was awarded by the British in 1880. He was one of the first Muslims in nineteenth century India to embrace the idea of modernization.  Early life  Latif was born in 1828 at the village of Rajapur, Faridpur District (present Bangladesh). His father Fakir Mahmud was a lawyer in the civil court of Kolkata. He obtained the highest degree in Arabic, French and English language from Calcutta Madrassah (now the Aliah University).  Career  Latif started his career as a teacher of Dhaka Collegiate School in 1846. By 1847, while still in his teens, he was appointed by the government as assistant to one of the Ameers of Sindh. He worked in this capacity for about a year. He was next appointed a teacher in the Dhaka Collegiate School. Here too he served for a brief period. In 1847, an Anglo- Arabic class in the Calcutta Madrassa was opened for imparting instruction in English. In 1848, he was appointed Anglo-Arabic professor in-charge of this class. Latif joined government service in 1849 as a deputy magistrate and was promoted to the post of presidency magistrate in 1877. While serving as the deputy magistrate of Satkhira, he witnessed the repression and exploitation of the peasants by the English indigo planters. He encouraged the farmers there to become united and tell the government about their grievances. He himself took some initiative in this Indigo revolt. Finally, the British government formed the Indigo Commission in 1860 due to his initiative with the goal of putting an end to the repressions of indigo planters. Latif was nominated a member of the Bengal Management Council when it was constituted in 1862 during the rule of Lord Canning. In 1863, he was appointed a member of the examination board for civil and military services and a fellow of the University of Calcutta. He was appointed as 'justice of the peace' following the formation of Calcutta Corporation (Municipal Authority) in 1865. He remained in that position until 1875. When there was intense anger among the Muslim community following the adoption of a proposal by the Indian Management Council in 1865, he put forward arguments in favour of amending the bill through a memorandum submitted to the British government. = Mohammedan Literary Society = In 1863, Nawab Abdul Latif founded the Mohammedan Literary Society. The Society gave a remarkable impetus to the cause of Muslim advancement throughout India. It attracted the notice of successive administrations, the wants and grievances of the Indian Muslim community in regard to education, legislation and other cognate matters affecting the well- being of society. The Society was the precursor of similar institutions in other parts of India.  Awards  The British government, in recognition of his meritorious services, honoured him with titles and decorations from time to time. In 1877, at the Imperial Assemblage, at Delhi, Viceroy Lord Lytton conferred upon him the title of \\"Khan Bahadur\\" and presented him with an \\"Empress Medal.\\" In April 1880, Lord Lytton conferred upon him the high title of \\"Nawab.\\" In 1883, Viceroy Lord Ripon honoured him with a \\"Companionship of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire.\\" In 1887, on the occasion of Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee, Viceroy Lord Dufferin conferred upon him the highest Muslim title of \\"Nawab Bahadur.\\" He received the title of 'Order of the Majedi of Third Class' from the Turkish government.  Death  Latif died on 10 July 1893. Legacy Latif's achievements include working to turn Hindu College into Presidency College and thus open it for non-Hindus as well. He also established numerous educational institutes, including Rajshahi Madrasah. As a prominent personality of mid 19th century Bengal, he was the pioneer of Muslim modernization and the architect of the Muslim Renaissance, was one of those great men who appeared as saviors of their frustrated, humiliated, demoralized and disorganized fellow countrymen under colonial rule His chief contribution was in the field of education. He was among the first to understand that young Bengali Muslims should receive modern education. He understood that the Muslims of Bengal had fallen behind in everything because of their prejudices against modern education. He devoted his whole life to removing this self-destructive prejudice from their minds. However, Bangladeshi educationist Ahmed Sharif criticized him for promoting Urdu over Bengali as the language of Bengali Muslims. Shaista Suhrawardy Ikramullah was Latif's great-granddaughter.

It grows in locations from the lowlands up to in the Alps. Like most grasses, it grows best in acid soils, ideally pH values of between 3.5 and 5, however, it can continue to live under more extreme conditions, sometimes to as low as 2. It is common on moist heathland, bogs and moorland throughout Britain and Ireland. Introduced populations exist in northeastern and northwestern North America. The specific epithet caerulea means \\"deep blue\\" and refers to the purple spikelets. Description Molinia caerulea is a herbaceous perennial bunchgrass (tussock-forming), growing up to tall (taller when sheltered by gorse and heather), with many closely packed stems. The leaves are coarse, green, taper to a point, long, flat and sometimes slightly hairy on top.Grasses by C E Hubbard, 1978, published by Penguin books Due to the dense tussock it is very resistant to heath fires. Its ligule is a ring of hairs, as in heath grass (Danthonia decumbens). The long narrow purple spikelets are a major identification feature ‚Äì the panicle is long. It flowers between July and September, later than any other species. Ecology The caterpillars of some Lepidoptera use it as a foodplant, e.g., the chequered skipper (Carterocephalus palaemon). Claviceps purpurea is an ascomycetous fungus which grows on the seeds of purple moor grass. Purple moor grass and rush pastures is a United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan habitat, on account of its rarity.UK BAP Purple Moor and Rush Pastures Cultivation Molinia caerulea is cultivated for its panicles of purple spikelets on yellow stems.

It is a capital of a separate gmina (municipality) and home to 4224 inhabitants as of 2006. The surrounding commune is inhabited by additional 5,327 people. The town is notable for the fact that between 1945 and 1992 it was a secret Soviet military base, erased from all maps and it was not transferred to Polish jurisdiction until October 1992. History The town of Borne Sulinowo traces back its roots to two distinct villages founded in the area in the 16th century by local Pomeranian nobility. Modern town occupies the place of the village of Linde (linden tree), which in 1590 had 12 inhabitants. A nearby village named Gro√üborn was home to 14 peasants. Both villages developed very slowly. In the late 19th century, the area of the village of Linde was bought by the Prussian government and converted into a military training ground. However, it was not until the advent of Nazism in Germany that changes really arrived there. During the first World War, there was an outcamp from Schneidemuhl prisoner of war camp at Gross Born. In 1933 the new German authorities bought all of the area and started the construction of a large military base, a training ground and various testing grounds there. Most of the local inhabitants were resettled and their homes razed to the ground. In place of the village of Linde, a small military garrison and a town was built. Paradoxically, it was given the name of the nearby village of Gross Born (which was also levelled), despite the fact that the actual namesake was located several kilometres to the south-east. All facilities were officially opened by Adolf Hitler on August 18, 1938. Soon afterwards the Artillery School of the Wehrmacht was moved there. Shortly before the outbreak of the Polish Defensive War of 1939, the training grounds housed Heinz Guderian's XIX Army Corps. During the later stages of World War II an artificial desert was built there for the units of Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps (the other such training ground was established in the B≈Çƒôd√≥w Desert near Olkusz). At the same time the area became part of the so-called Pomeranian Rampart, a line of almost 1000 concrete bunkers guarding the pre-war Polish-German border and eastern approaches to Berlin. In September 1939 in the military barracks a German POW camp was established for Polish soldiers, as well as for Russian, French and Yugoslavian POWs-Stalag 302, where more than 30,000 were murdered. Later it became an oflag. See main article Oflag II-D. After January 22, 1945, the Pomeranian Rampart lines of defences around Gross-Born were manned by local artillery school NCOs and local fighting for the area started. Actual engagements with the Polish Army and the Red Army started in early February and lasted for more than a month. The town however was located behind the lines and survived the war almost undamaged. After the war, the area of two military bases and the town itself was taken by the Red Army. There the Soviet military established one of the biggest military camps of the Northern Group of Forces. The town was excluded from Polish jurisdiction and erased from all maps, even though officially part of the People's Republic of Poland. In official documents of the surrounding communes, the area of former Gross-Born and the surrounding 180 km¬≤ were called forest areas and remained a secret for almost 50 years. and after World War II it remained in Soviet hands, as a military base. Following the peaceful change of political system in Poland in 1989, an agreement was finally reached to withdraw the Soviet Army from Poland. The last of the large units, the 15,000 men strong 6th Guards Motor Rifle Division Vitebsk-Novgorod (later renamed the 166th Guards Motor Rifle Brigade of the Russian Federation) was withdrawn from Borne Sulinowo in October 1992. The town became a part of Poland. It was briefly controlled by the Polish Army, with a small contingent of the Polish 41st Mechanized Regiment stationed there. However, in April of the following year the Polish unit was withdrawn and the town was finally passed to civilian authorities - for the first time since the 19th century. On June 5, 1993, at 12 am, the town was officially opened to the public. On September 15 of the same year the Council of Ministers granted the town with a city charter and a process of settlement started. Among the first inhabitants of the town were Polish repatriates from Russian Siberia and Kazakhstan, who were finally allowed to return to Poland after more than 50 years of forcible resettlement in Soviet Union. International Gathering of Military Vehicles Since 2004, Borne Sulinowo has hosted the International Gathering of Military Vehicles (Miƒôdzynarodowy Zlot Pojazd√≥w Militarnych). The event takes place over one weekend in August and has slowly grown into a general gathering of military enthusiasts and history buffs, with live concerts and cavalry shows for entertainment. The event offers attendees a chance to ride in a variety of vehicles, including tanks. Military surplus and historical items are sold in the bazaar. Many individuals choose to camp on-premises for the duration, and a large number wear military uniforms from different countries and time periods - World War II being the most popular.

Early life and education Wade was the eldest son of Armagil Wade, the traveller, who sailed with a party of adventurers for North America in 1536, later, one of the clerks of the privy council in London and a member of parliament, and his first wife, Anne Waller. Both his parents died in 1568, and Wade succeeded to the family property, his father's sons by his first wife having predeceased him. In 1571 he was admitted a student of Gray's Inn, and a few years later, doubtless with a view to entering the service of the government, he began travelling on the continent. Career In July 1576 Waad was living in Paris and frequently supplied political information to William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, whose \\"servant\\" he is described as being.Lansd. MS. 23, art. 75 He claimed \\"familiar acquaintance\\" with the celebrated French publicist Jean Bodin, from whom he seems to have derived some of the news he forwarded to Burghley. In the autumn of 1576 Amias Paulet took Wade to Blois.Cal. State Papers, For. 1575-7 During the winter of 1578‚Äì79 he was in Italy, from where he forwarded to Burghley reports on its political condition. From Venice in April 1579 he sent Burghley fifty of the rarest kinds of seeds in Italy.Cal. Hatfield MSS. ii. 254 In May he was in Florence, and in February 1579/80 he was living in Strasbourg. In the following April he was employed on a delicate mission in Paris by Sir Henry Cobham. Among appointments in London, Waad undertook a number of ambassadorial missions, in 1580 to Portugal;Sloane MS 1442, f. 114 ‚Äì Instructions to, as Ambassador to Portugal, [1580] then in 1581 he became secretary to Sir Francis Walsingham and in 1583 he was appointed as one of the clerks of the Privy Council.Cal.

In the same month Waad was sent to Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots, to induce her to come to terms with Elizabeth, and his account of the interview is printed by Froude.Froude, 448-51 In February 1584-5 he was appointed to accompany Nau to the court of King James VI of Scotland, but his appointment was cancelled at the last minute.Cal.

Henry III was willing to consider the request, but the Catholic League and the Guises were violently opposed to it and even instructed the Duc d'Aumale to waylay Waad and rescue Morgan on their way to the coast. Waad, however, convinced that he could not secure Morgan, contented himself with obtaining a promise that Morgan should be detained in prison in France, but Aumale nevertheless attacked the envoy near Amiens and inflicted on him a severe beating as an answer to his demand for the extradition of a Roman Catholic from France. In August, Waad accompanied William Davison to the Low Countries to negotiate an alliance with the States-General of the Netherlands. A year later he took a prominent part in arranging the seizure of Mary Stuart's papers, which implicated her in the Babington Plot. He himself went down to Chartley in August 1586, and, while Mary was decoyed away on a hunting expedition, arrested her secretaries Nau and Curle, and having ransacked her cabinet, carried back a valuable collection of papers to London.Cal. State Papers, Simancas, 1580-6 pp. 625‚Äì6Paulet pp. 288 sqqFroude xii. 160 sqq For this important service he was paid thirty pounds.Acts P. C. 1586-7, p. 211 In 1587 Waad was again in France. During the remainder of the reign of Elizabeth I of England, he was much occupied in searching for Jesuits and in discovering plots against the life of the queen. James I, who knighted him in 1603. employed him in similar ways, and he was occupied that year in unravelling the Bye Plot and Main Plot. Waad was Lieutenant of the Tower of London at the time of the Gunpowder Plot and questioned Guy Fawkes. For some time Waad was a member of the Parliament of England, elected as MP for Aldborough (1584), Thetford (1589), Preston (1601) and West Looe (1604). Later life He retired from public life in 1613, at the instigation of Frances Howard, Countess of Essex. She wanted Wade replaced with a less honest Lieutenant of the Tower, Sir Gervase Helwys, as part of her scheme to murder the prisoner Thomas Overbury, who was opposed to her affair with Robert Carr. Wade had allowed Lady Arbella Stuart a key to her quarters in the Tower, and this was made the pretext for his replacement by Helwys. Wade was later praised by Lloyd, who claimed that \\"to his directions we owe Rider's Dictionary, to his encouragement Hooker's Polity, and to his charge Gruter's Inscriptions.James Granger, A biographical history of England from Egbert the Great to the Revolution (3rd edition, 1779), p. 402 A wall tablet within the church of St Mary the Virgin at Manuden in Essex commemorates Wade (named Waad on the tablet).

She was elected a Member of the American Philosophical Society in 2019. Childhood and education Born in New York City, on October 4, 1929, Judith (Jarvis) Thomson was the second child of Theodore Jarvis (Javitz), an accountant, and Helen (Vostrey) Jarvis, an English teacher. Her mother was of Catholic Czech extraction, and her father was descended from a line of Eastern European rabbis, including Rabbi Hayyim Eliezer Wachs of Kalish and Rabbi Jacob Emden. Raised in an observant family on the Lower East Side, Theodore Javitz changed his name to Jarvis in 1918. His relationship with his wife, which began at socialist summer camp, was a source of tension for both their families. Helen Jarvis died when Judith was six, and Theodore Jarvis remarried two years later. His second wife had two children. She was a successful interior designer and an arts and antique dealer and importer. Judith attended elementary school in New York City and in Yonkers, graduating from Hunter College High School in January 1946. She went on to receive a B.A. from Barnard College in 1950, a second B.A. from Cambridge University in 1952 (at Newnham College, Cambridge), an M.A. from Cambridge in 1956, and a Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1959, all in philosophy. In 1962, she began teaching at Barnard College, and in 1962 she met and married the British philosopher James Thomson, who was a visiting professor at Columbia University. After spending 1962‚Äì1963 at Oxford, the couple moved to Boston, where James Thomson was appointed professor of philosophy at MIT. Judith Thomson taught for a year at Boston University and, in 1964, was appointed to the faculty at MIT, where she is currently Laurence S. Rockefeller Professor of Philosophy. The Thomsons were separated in 1976 and divorced in 1980; they remained colleagues until James Thomson‚Äôs death in 1984. Later career Judith Thomson has been visiting professor at the University of Pittsburgh (1976), the University of California at Berkeley Law School (1983), and Yale Law School (1982, 1984, 1985), and has held fellowships from the Fulbright Foundation (1950‚Äì1951), the American Association of University Women (1962‚Äì1963), the National Endowment for the Humanities (1978‚Äì1979, 1986‚Äì1987), the Guggenheim Foundation (1986‚Äì1987), and the Center for Advanced Study in Oslo, Norway (1996). In 1989, she was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and in 1992‚Äì1993 she served as president of the American Philosophical Association (APA), Eastern Division. In 1999, she gave the Tanner Lectures on Human Values on \\"Goodness and Advice,\\" at Princeton University, and in 2003, she gave the Paul Carus Lectures on \\"Normativity,\\" at the APA Central Division meetings. She taught at MIT for the majority of her career, remaining there as professor emerita. In 2012, she was awarded the Quinn Prize by the American Philosophical Association. In 2015, she was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Cambridge, and in 2016 by Harvard University. In 2016, she was elected to a Corresponding Fellowship of the British Academy. Research areas and publications Thomson's main areas of research are moral philosophy and metaphysics. In moral philosophy she has made significant contributions to meta-ethics, normative ethics and applied ethics. Her contribution to her book with Gilbert Harman, Moral Relativism and Moral Objectivity (1996) defends the objectivity of morality against Harman's relativism. The papers collected in Rights, Restitution and Risk (1986) include discussions of assisted suicide, abortion, self-defense, and preferential hiring. And her work published in Goodness and Advice (2001) and The Realm of Rights (1992) cover basic issues in normative moral theory concerning the basis of moral rights and an account of goodness. Her work in metaphysics focuses on issues concerning action and events, time and parthood. \\"A Defense of Abortion\\" One thought experiment for which Thomson is especially well-known occurs in her paper A Defense of Abortion: : You wake up in the morning and find yourself back to back in bed with an unconscious violinist. A famous unconscious violinist. He has been found to have a fatal kidney ailment, and the Society of Music Lovers has canvassed all the available medical records and found that you alone have the right blood type to help. They have therefore kidnapped you, and last night the violinist's circulatory system was plugged into yours, so that your kidneys can be used to extract poisons from his blood as well as your own. ... To unplug you would be to kill him. But never mind, it's only for nine months. By then he will have recovered from his ailment, and can safely be unplugged from you. The scenario is meant to suggest that the human right not to be killed can be trumped by another person's right to control her own body, when these two rights come into conflict. In this paper, Thomson argues on the basis of the violinist thought experiment that \\"the right to life consists not in the right not to be killed, but rather in the right not to be killed unjustly.\\" Therefore, to show that abortion is morally impermissible, \\"it is by no means enough to show that the fetus is a person and to remind us that all persons have a right to life--we need to be shown also that killing the fetus violates its right to life, i.e., that abortion is unjust killing. And is it?\\" Thomson's article defends abortion rights and functions primarily as an argument by analogy in regards to the idea of mother/fetus consanguinity. The paper meets reactions and criticisms from many different philosophers and bioethicists. Philippa Foot, a prominent Aristotelian ethicist argued that negative non-provision of service, as in the case of the violinist, is different from active killing, or interference, as in abortion (see Foot's book Moral Dilemmas, 86‚Äì87). Thomson's thought experiment has also been replied to by Oxford philosopher John Finnis in \\"The Rights and Wrongs of Abortion: a reply to Judith Thomson\\".John Finnis, \\"The Rights and Wrongs of Abortion: a reply to Judith Thomson\\" in Human Rights and the Common Good Thomson in turn replied to Finnis in her paper, \\"Rights and Deaths\\", reprinted in her volume of essays, Rights, Restitution, and Risk.

Retrieved 1 June 2013.Irish Transport and General Workers' Union papers, National Library of Ireland. Retrieved 1 June 2013. Initially drawing its membership from branches of the Liverpool-based National Union of Dock Labourers, from which Larkin had been expelled, it grew to include workers in a range of industries. The ITGWU logo was the Red Hand of Ulster, which is synonymous with ancient Gaelic Ulster. The ITGWU was at the centre of the syndicalist-inspired Dublin Lockout in 1913, the events of which left a lasting impression on the union and hence on the Irish Labour Movement. After Larkin's departure for the United States in 1914 in the wake of the Lockout, James Connolly led the ITGWU until his execution in 1916 in the wake of the Easter Rising. In turn, William X. O'Brien became the union's leading figure, and ultimately served as general secretary for many years. Throughout World War I, the ITGWU consistently opposed Irish belligerence, and staunchly supported the advanced nationalist cause. In fact, ITGWU members, in the uniform of the Irish Citizen Army, played a leading role in the Easter Rising, while the Transport Union led a national strike that crippled an attempt to introduce conscription to Ireland in 1918.Phelan, Mark, 'World War I and the Legacy of the Dublin Lockout, 1914‚Äì1916', in √âire-Ireland (Winter, 2016) In 1923, Larkin formed a new union, the Workers' Union of Ireland, to which many of the ITGWU's Dublin members affiliated.Irish Transport and General Workers' Union papers, National Library of Ireland. Retrieved 1 June 2013. The ITGWU nevertheless remained the dominant force in Irish trade unionism, especially outside the capital. William O'Brien and James Larkin remained bitter personal enemies, and when Larkin and his supporters were readmitted into the Labour Party in the early 1940s, O'Brien engineered a split in the party, with the new National Labour Party claiming that the main party had been infiltrated by communists. A further split occurred in the Irish Trades Union Congress when that body accepted the WUI's membership in 1945. The ITGWU left the Congress and established the rival Congress of Irish Unions. From the 1950s on proposals to merge the two unions were floated.

Gregory Salinger made his live-action debut in the third season of the Marvel Cinematic Universe television series Jessica Jones, portrayed by Jeremy Bobb. Publication history The original Foolkiller was introduced in Man-Thing #3 and killed in the next issue. He was created by Steve Gerber and Val Mayerik. In his brief Man-Thing appearance, the Foolkiller attempted to kill two major characters in the series: F.A. Schist, a real estate developer whose projects threatened the ecology of the Florida Everglades, and Richard Rory, a disc jockey who had denounced the Foolkiller's activities. His real name was not given until a later flashback in The Amazing Spider-Man #225, which stated that it was Ross G. Everbest (a variant of Gerber's Reg Everbest pseudonym with his middle name attached to it). Gerber, Mary Skrenes and Jim Mooney created Greg Salinger, the second version of the character, which first appeared in Omega the Unknown #9 (plus a one-panel cameo in #8, which was written by Roger Stern and drawn by Lee Elias). Gerber's Foolkiller miniseries, illustrated by J. J. Birch, was published from October 1990 to October 1991. It focused on a new version, Kurt Gerhardt. A new Foolkiller, Mike Trace, has appeared in two five-issue MAX series: Foolkiller (2007) and Foolkiller: White Angels (2009). He was created by Gregg Hurwitz and Lan Medina. In 2016, Marvel announced Foolkiller's return in his own series, penned by Max Bemis, picking up the story of Greg Salinger as a personal therapist and, again, as the Foolkiller. Fictional character biography =Ross G. Everbest= The original Foolkiller was more of a reactionary crusader than subsequent versions of the character. Upset by anti- Vietnam War protests and counterculture movements, he decided that sinners, dissidents, and criminals alike were \\"fools\\" who must be eliminated, and that he had been chosen by God to do so. He was inspired by a faith healer, Reverend Mike Pike,surname revealed in Foolkiller #2 who cured his childhood paralysis. As a result, he became an evangelist with Reverend Mike as his mentor and soon became as popular as the Reverend. After catching Reverend Mike in a drunken orgy, he killed his former hero, preserved the corpse in formaldehyde, and used the preacher's money to fund his vigilante activities. He donned a flamboyant Zorro-like costume and acquired (by unknown means) his \\"purification gun\\", a raygun which disintegrated people instantly. Some of his victims were given a 24-hour warning in the form of a calling card: \\"Foolkiller / e pluribus unum / You have 24 hours to live. Use them to repent or be forever damned to the pits of hell where goeth all fools. Today is the last day of the rest of your life. Use it wisely or die a fool\\". The Foolkiller had sought to kill Ted Sallis (whom he knew to be the Man-Thing based on connecting news reports), disc jockey Richard Rory, and businessman F.A. Schist. During a struggle with the monstrous Man-Thing in the Man-Thing's swamp, the Foolkiller died in a freak accident, impaled in the heart by a shard of glass from the tank containing Reverend Mike.Man-Thing #3‚Äì4. Marvel Comics. Everbest's soul is apparently in Mephisto's Hell battling others in the \\"Arena of Lost Souls\\".Thunderbolts Annual 2000. Marvel Comics. =Gregory P. Salinger= Greg Salinger, imprisoned for disorderly conduct, heard the story of the first Foolkiller from his cellmate, Richard Rory, incarcerated on a trumped-up kidnapping charge.Man-Thing #20. Marvel Comics (New York). After being released, Salinger stole the Foolkiller's equipment and assumed his identity, using the \\"purification gun\\" to kill a number of people in New York including the supervillain Blockbuster. Unlike his religiously inspired predecessor, Salinger defined \\"fools\\" as those guilty of materialism and mediocrity, or anyone who lacked \\"a poetic nature\\".Omega the Unknown #8‚Äì9. Marvel Comics (New York). Rory, feeling responsible for Salinger's breakdown and crimes, tried to help the Defenders arrest Salinger, by persuading him that he could join them as a superhero. However, Salinger had decided the Defenders were \\"fools\\" after their failure to capture another supervillain; he sought to kill Lunatik, and burned down their headquarters and was captured by the Defenders, but escaped in a road accident.The Defenders #73‚Äì75, written by Ed Hannigan. Marvel Comics. Salinger reappeared, studying at Empire State University, where teaching assistant Peter Parker (Spider-Man) befriended him, then stopped him in the midst of another killing spree. When a homeless witness suggested that only a fool would fight Spider-Man, Salinger attempted to shoot himself, but was stopped, arrested, found criminally insane and institutionalized for good at the Central Indiana State Mental Institution in Weldon Creek, Indiana.Stern, Roger (w). The Amazing Spider-Man #225‚Äì226. Marvel Comics (New York). He appeared briefly as a mental patient, where he was questioned by Captain America concerning a possible connection with the vigilante known as Scourge of the Underworld.Gruenwald, Mark (w). Captain America #319. Marvel Comics (New York). He also appeared as a seemingly much saner inmate, and was interviewed on the Runyan Moody TV show. He advised the third Foolkiller (Gerhardt) through a computer bulletin board, though their contact was finally discovered by psychiatrist Dr. Mears and the police.Gerber, Steve (w). Foolkiller #1‚Äì10. Marvel Comics (New York). Salinger (now wearing an armored costume, and wielding conventional weaponry) would go on to join Deadpool's Heroes for Hire (later rechristened the Mercs for Money). While with the group, Salinger acquired a degree in psychiatry, which led to him becoming Deadpool's reluctant personal therapist. S.H.I.E.L.D. then recruited Salinger as a psychiatrist to rehabilitate supervillains, with a catch: if they do not cooperate or make progress, then he is allowed to execute them.\\"Foolkiller (2016) #1\\". Marvel Comics. Retrieved September 4, 2019. =Kurt Gerhardt= Kurt Gerhardt had reached a state of homicidal despair after the random murder of his father, a divorce, the loss of his bank job (part of the savings and loan crisis), and being brutally robbed at his new job in a fast-food restaurant. The first issue shows much of Salinger's life in the mental institution. He details nightmares and guilt to his doctor. He expresses a desire to write out his feelings, believing it will make him feel better. The doctor points out that the last time Salinger was given a pencil, he drove it into his own neck. Salinger promises it will not happen again. The therapist allows Salinger to use one of the institution's computers' word processors so that he can write letters. He decides to send his memoirs and thoughts to media and publication centers. No reply comes back. Salinger is noted by a popular talk show host, Runyan Moody, who browbeats his way into an interview with Salinger. Gerhardt sees this and via Salinger's secret use of the modem in his therapist's computer, they set up a correspondence via a computer bulletin board. Salinger directs Gerhardt to an old confidant who provides him with the Foolkiller costume and \\"purification gun\\". He eventually abandoned the gaudy costume, substituting a bondage-style leather mask and outfit (or appearing in a variety of disguises), and created a simpler calling card: \\"Foolkiller / e pluribus unum / Actions have consequences\\". Initially, Gerhardt directed his vigilante campaign at violent criminals, garnering some praise from the public, but his anger at abuse and neglect in general led him to kill drug-addicted negligent mothers and even their (albeit violent) children in a series of escalating massacres. His ever- broader definition of \\"fools\\" who deserved death broadened to include those guilty of what Gerhardt believed to be rank hypocrisy or stupidity. At Burger Clown, Gerhardt develops a promising romantic relationship with a co-worker, Linda Klein. He becomes a popular man in his neighborhood. Acting heroically, even without the gun, Gerhardt saves an acquaintance from being run down by a drunk. Gerhardt, however, must be stopped from beating on the driver. In a move celebrated by his friends at the restaurant, he gains a job at a credit agency. His work-neighbor is a crass, older man who enjoys using his power for thrills and cheap revenge. In a moment of weakness, Gerhardt even considers using his gun on this man, along with others who are guilty of only being annoying. This includes a younger man that he perceived as a possible competitor for Linda Klein's affections. Gerhardt was especially frustrated at the public's thoughtless pursuit of instant or momentary gratification and this became the centralizing theme of his killing spree. Gerhardt abruptly broke off his relationship with Linda and sent a manifesto to the Daily Bugle newspaper. His ever-increasing kills become more violent, taking place in front of, and traumatizing, many innocent people. Once such incident is viewed by Linda who had recognized Kurt's voice although, for reasons unknown, she elected not to inform the police. Gerhardt even goes after 'foolish' celebrities, killing an industrialist who was stripping Amazon rain forest land to raise cattle for beef after learning of his criminal associations, and his having placed a bounty on his head in an attempt to turn the public hostile towards the Foolkiller. At the end of the miniseries, after escaping the police (his online communications with Salinger having been discovered) and having killed his drug lord nemesis, Gerhardt has his face altered with the assistance of his predecessor's friend. She carefully uses acid to mar his face. He leaves New York City to assume a new identity in Arizona and live in peace. As pointed out in the Appendix to The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe, Gerhardt's new identity resembles Richard Rory. Ultimate Gerhardt, of an identical history to the original Gerdhart bar with a more sociopathic outlook on life, appeared in New Avengers as a Raft inmate, although the circumstances surrounding his capture have not been revealed. After Electro organizes a massive breakout, he was seen attacking Spider-Man with many other villains, after which he escaped.New Avengers #02. Marvel Comics. The Hood hired him as part of his criminal organization to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the Superhuman Registration Act. At some point he was captured and sent to Crossmore Prison for the Criminally Insane, where he came into conflict with fellow inmate Deadpool.Deadpool (vol. 4) #40‚Äì42. Marvel Comics. After repeatedly attempting to gain therapy from and then teach back what it means to be the Foolkiller, all while acting on the orders of the Hood, Gerdhart is shot in the face and killed by Salinger.Footkiller #10 (2016). Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities Each version of the Foolkiller (except Mike Trace) primarily used a \\"purification gun\\", a pistol capable of shooting a laser-like beam of energy capable of totally incinerating a human being within seconds. They also used mobile computer systems and surveillance systems to locate and track victims. The first two also employed an armored truck outfitted with similar systems which also acted as a mobile headquarters. All of the Foolkillers have been athletic men with no superhuman powers and all of them are criminally insane. Everbest was a charismatic preacher and skilled in several forms of hand-to-hand combat. Salinger is an amateur poet and is a self-trained fair hand-to-hand combatant. At one time he was said to have been in the army but was discharged for medical reasons, possibly related to his mental instability. Gerhardt was skilled in basic hand-to-hand combat and had developed a high tolerance for pain. He was also a good strategist and a master of disguise. Trace does not use the purification gun; instead his weapon of choice is a swordstick. Other versions =Mike Trace= A new five-issue Foolkiller miniseries, written by Gregg Hurwitz, debuted under Marvel's MAX adult imprint, in October 2007. In a 2007 Newsarama interview, Hurwitz declared: > I‚Äôm a Punisher guy. What Garth Ennis has done with Frank Castle really is > what made me realize what comic books could do. The Foolkiller is obviously > different in a number of ways from the Punisher, but he‚Äôs also perhaps the > closest thing the Marvel Universe has to him. Similarly, Axel Alonso, stated: > He was interested in writing a crime thriller and Punisher was off the > table. The Foolkiller of the Marvel MAX title is Mike Trace, a man who treats his murders as works of art. Typically, he will leave the bodies at the scene along with ironic indications of why they were killed. In one case, he murders a corporate industrialist and leaves the body in a trashcan filled with toxic waste from the industrialist's own factories. The story of this Foolkiller, however, is told mostly through the eyes of Nate McBride, a former enforcer for a loansharking operation. When Nate steals money to pay for his daughter's much-needed heart operation, his employers punish him by killing his wife and younger daughter and threatening to kill his invalid daughter in 30 days if the money is not paid back. Nate, fearing for the safety of his hospitalized daughter, decides to enlist the help of the Foolkiller, whom he had heard about from the news and from whispered rumors on the street. Although the Foolkiller initially berates Nate as a fool due to the life he leads, he takes an interest in their possible connection to a mob boss known as the Cheese. Nate acts as the Foolkiller's assistant, gathering information on the Cheese's henchmen and operations. As the Foolkiller begins to eliminate the Cheese's enforcers, the Cheese calls in a diminutive assassin known as Sickle Moon, due to the sickle-shaped blade he employs. The Foolkiller, concluding that Sickle Moon will abort his mission if his employer is killed, decides to go after the Cheese directly, with Nate acting as a diversion. While the Foolkiller is successful in killing the Cheese, Nate is killed by Sickle Moon who, as expected, retreats after realizing that his employer is dead. The Foolkiller carries Nate's body to the hospital and announces that Nate's heart should be suitable for a transplant for his daughter. It is not certain if the operation was carried out. In the second five-issue miniseries Foolkiller: White Angels, his latest target is a white supremacist gang called the White Angels, which lynched an ex-convict who had become a white-collar worker and had evidently turned his life around. The Punisher appears in the second issue, since he is also targeting the White Angels. In keeping with the realism of the Marvel MAX line, Mike Trace does not dress in a costume or use a purification ray gun. He will employ whatever weapons are available, but his favorite weapon is a sword cane. He leaves a tarot card of The Fool at all of his killings. The tarot card has handwritten on it \\"Are you?\\". Trace also appears to be the only Foolkiller in the MAX continuity. However, there are oblique references to the Foolkillers of the mainstream Marvel Universe, such as the naming of a prison as the Gerhardt Detention Facility. In the first issue of the MAX series, while discussing rumors about the mostly unseen Foolkiller, there was a reference in character dialogue to the purification ray gun and Zorro-like costume of the original Marvel version, as well as the fact that one of them briefly worked at a Burger Clown restaurant. Since the Foolkiller's activities of the mainstream Marvel universe were publicly known, it is likely that these were meant to be tongue in cheek. = Foolkillers 2099 = A cabal of fundamentalist super-soldiers modeled themselves after the Foolkillers of the 20th century. One of their number was encountered by the X-Men of 2099 after he embarked on a mission to assassinate all former members of Xi'an Chi Xan's original team, \\"the Lawless\\".  Notes on continuity  *In the New Avengers: Most Wanted Files, Spider-Man recalls that he found it unusual that during the Raft breakout, Gerhardt called him out, along with other inmates who had a vendetta against Spider Man. Although Spider-Man does make an appearance in Foolkiller #8, he does not encounter Gerhardt. He also recalls hearing that Salinger was briefly released by renegade government agent Mike Clemson to go on a killing spree in order to frame Vengeance. This was briefly seen in Marvel Comics Presents #172, where the framing scheme was a failure. * New Avengers Most Wanted Files also incorrectly states that the Foolkiller killed his drug dealer nemesis, Backhand. The man instead escaped, though he was seriously crippled by Gerhardt's attack. * The ending of Omega the Unknown #9 (Salinger's first appearance) had a blurb referring to the content of the next issue: \\"Greg's secret sorrow\\". This refers to a story that was planned but replaced at the last minute when it was realized that the series would be cancelled with issue #10. Salinger would not appear again until Defenders #74. * In issue #4 of the 1990‚Äì1991 Foolkiller miniseries, Merle Singer explains that Salinger killed many more fools than is publicly known. The ashen remains were typically easy to dispose of, being washed down a sewer by rain, for example. The only \\"fool\\" that Salinger is publicly known to have killed is the Blockbuster. In Omega the Unknown #9, the other two unnamed people he killed in public could not be directly connected to him, as he was not clearly seen at the time. Upon killing the Blockbuster later in that issue, Salinger did openly address Omega within earshot of bystanders while delivering his catchphrase \\"Live a poem or die a fool\\". Issue #225 of Amazing Spider-Man supports the premise that Salinger made it improbable that anyone would connect his murder of the FBI agents to him. However, Salinger's killing of them was mentioned by Runyan Moody during his television interview. =Marvel Universe trading card series= In 1990, Marvel released a Foolkiller (Kurt Gerhardt) card in their Marvel Universe trading card series as a rookie superhero. In other media Gregory Sallinger (spelled with two L's) appears in the Marvel Cinematic Universe TV series Jessica Jones, portrayed by Jeremy Bobb. This version is a polymath who holds numerous degrees in law, psychology, chemistry, engineering, particle physics, and biology and is well trained in contact wrestling. He had an abusive father who preferred his brother Donny over him. While not confirmed, it is implied that his brother was his first victim. He then killed his friend and fellow wrestler Nathan Silva after growing jealous of him. Years later, he attempted to kill Erik Gelden when he found out about his murders, only to accidentally stab Jessica Jones instead. He starts to target and accuse her of being a \\"fraud\\" due to her gaining superpowers. Sallinger manages to outsmart Jessica, even kidnapping Erik and torturing him. Despite her rescuing him, he is not arrested due to lack of evidence, among other reasons. Sallinger decides to kill Dorothy Walker in order to get to Jessica, but ends up being attacked by Dorothy's daughter Trish instead. After being hospitalized, he forces Jessica to destroy any evidence she collected on him or else he will release a photo of Trish attacking him. Once Sallinger leaves the hospital, he seeks out Jessica's help to escape Trish and protect him. Despite all this, Sallinger captures and tortures Jessica, only for her to reveal that she has recorded a confession from him, and he is immediately arrested. Still angry over her mother's death, Trish corners Sallinger in the elevator after subduing his guard detail and kills him while he is being transported to prison.

It took place on October 15, 1969, followed a month later, on November 15, 1969, by a large Moratorium March in Washington, D.C. Fred Halstead writes that it was \\"the first time [the anti-war movement] reached the level of a full-fledged mass movement.‚Äù First Moratorium =Background= When the new Republican president, Richard Nixon, took office on January 20, 1969, about 34,000 Americans had been killed fighting in Vietnam by that point.Karnow, Stanley Vietnam: A History, New York: Viking Press, 1983 p.601. During Nixon's first year in office, from January 1969 to January 1970, about another 10,000 Americans were killed fighting in Vietnam. Though Nixon talked much in 1969 of his plans for \\"peace with honor\\" and Vietnamization, the general feeling at the time was that Nixon's policies were essentially the same as Lyndon Johnson's. The Moratorium developed from Jerome Grossman's April 20, 1969 call for a general strike if the war had not concluded by October. David Hawk and Sam Brown, who had previously worked on the unsuccessful 1968 presidential campaign of Eugene McCarthy, changed the concept to a less radical moratorium and began to organize the event as the Vietnam Moratorium Committee with David Mixner, Marge Sklenkar, John Gage, and others. Brown, who was 25 years old in 1969, was a former divinity student who had worked hard as a campaign volunteer for Senator McCarthy in 1968, developed the concept of the moratorium protests.Karnow, Stanley Vietnam: A History, New York: Viking Press, 1983 p.598. Brown felt that protests should take place in communities rather than on university campuses so that \\"the heartland folks felt it belonged to them\\". Brown and other moderate leaders of the anti-war movement believed that the best way of bringing pressure on Nixon was to ensure the movement had a \\"respectable\\" face in order to win the support of the largest number of Americans, many of whom did not much like either the hippie counterculture or the radical New Left movement. The Vietnam Moratorium Committee sought the support of \\"respectable\\" groups like the civil rights movement, churches, university faculties, unions, business leaders, and politicians. Before the Moratorium of October 15, the North Vietnamese Premier Ph·∫°m VƒÉn ƒê·ªìng released a letter praising the marchers for trying to save young American men \\"from a useless death in Vietnam\\".Lannguth, A.J. Our Vietnam, New York: Simon & Schuster 2000 p.594 In a speech written by Patrick Buchanan, the Vice President, Spiro Agnew, demanded that the organizers of the Moratorium disallow ƒê·ªìng's letter and accused them of being \\"communist dupes\\". As with previous large anti-war demonstrations, including the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam's April 15, 1967 march on the United Nations and their 1967 March on the Pentagon, the event was a clear success, with millions participating throughout the world. Future U.S. President Bill Clinton, then a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford, organized and participated in the demonstration in England; this later became an issue in his Presidential campaign. =March= In New York City, the day marked Game 4 of the 1969 World Series and included controversy as Mayor John Lindsay wanted the US flag to be flown at half-staff; however, Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn overruled the mayor and ordered the flag to be flown at full staff. Also, Mets Game 4 Starter Tom Seaver had his face on some anti-Moratorium Day literature distributed before the game. Seaver claimed that his picture was used without his knowledge or approval. The Mets won that day's game in 10 innings and would go on to win the Series the next day. Over a quarter of million people attended the Moratorium march in Washington, D.C., where they marched down Pennsylvania Avenue in the evening bearing candles led by Coretta Scott King to the White House.Karnow, Stanley Vietnam: A History, New York: Viking Press, 1983 p.599. Scott King told the marchers that it would have delighted her assassinated husband, Martin Luther King Jr., to have seen people of all races rallying together for the cause of peace. The rallies in New York, Detroit, Boston (where about 100,000 attended a speech by anti-war Senator George McGovern), and Miami were also well attended. Unlike the protests at the Democratic Convention in Chicago in August 1968 which led to a police riot, the Moratorium marches on October 15 were completely peaceful with the main theme being grief and sorrow over the war, instead of anger and rage. The journalist Stanley Karnow wrote the Moratorium marches were \\"...a sober, almost melancholy manifestation of middle class concern...\\". Speakers at the Moratorium marches included Coretta Scott King, Dr. Benjamin Spock, David Dellinger, W. Averell Harriman, and Arthur Goldberg. In his speech in New York, Harriman predicted that Nixon \\"is going to have to pay attention\\". About Nixon's statement that he would not be affected by Moratorium marches, the comedian Dick Gregory told the crowd: \\"The President says nothing you kids do will have any effect on him. Well, I suggest he make one long-distance call to the LBJ ranch\\". =Aftermath= In a statement to the press, President Nixon stated: \\"Under no circumstances will I be affected\\" as \\"policy made in the streets equals anarchy\\". On October 15, 1983, the White House press secretary declared that Nixon was completely indifferent to the Moratorium and that day had been \\"business as usual\\". In private, Nixon was enraged by the Moratorium and felt very much besieged as he felt that the Moratorium had undercut his policy of winning \\"peace with honor\\" in Vietnam. Nixon ordered his aides to start writing a speech to rebut the Moratorium protests, which took two weeks to produce a version that was satisfactory to the president. On October 19, 1969, Agnew in a speech in New Orleans charged that \\"a spirit of national masochism prevails, encouraged by an effete corps of impudent snobs who characterize themselves as intellectuals\\".Wornsnop, Richard \\"United States\\" from Encyclopedia Britannia Yearbook 1970 p. 783. Agnew also accused the peace movement of being controlled by \\"hardcore dissidents and professional anarchists\\" who were planning \\"wilder, more violent\\" demonstrations at the next Moratorium. In its coverage of the first marches, an article in Time remarked that the Moratorium had brought \\"new respectability and popularity\\" to the anti-war movement. In various locations all over the United States, over 15 million people took part in marches against the war on October 15. The success of the Moratorium marches was due largely to avoiding the violence that many Americans associated with the New Left and the hippie \\"sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll\\" sensibility that was widely considered to be anti-social. In response to the Moratorium of October 15, on the evening of November 3, 1969 Nixon went on national television to give his \\"silent majority speech\\" asking for the support of the \\"silent majority\\" of Americans for his Vietnam War policy.Karnow, Stanley Vietnam: A History, New York: Viking Press, 1983 p.599-600. In his speech, Nixon professed to share the goal of the protesters of peace in Vietnam, but he argued that the United States had to win in Vietnam, which would require keeping the war going until such a time that the government of North Vietnam ceased trying to overthrow the government of South Vietnam.Karnow, Stanley Vietnam: A History, New York: Viking Press, 1983 p.600. Nixon implicitly conceded the point to the anti-war movement that South Vietnam was not important, saying the real issue was America's credibility, as he maintained that America's allies would lose faith if the United States did not stand by South Vietnam. Nixon promised that his policy of Vietnamization would gradually lower American losses in Vietnam; stated he was willing to compromise provided that North Vietnam recognized South Vietnam; and finally warned that would take \\"strong and effective measures\\" if the war continued. Nixon ended his \\"silent majority speech\\" with: \\"And so tonight, to you, the great silent majority of my fellow Americans-I ask for your support. Let us be united for peace. Let us be united against defeat. Because let us understand: North Vietnam cannot defeat or humiliate the United States. Only Americans can do that\\". The public response to Nixon's \\"silent majority speech\\" was very positive with the phone lines to the White House becoming jammed in the hours after he gave his speech as too many people called the White House to congratulate the president. Likewise, the response to Agnew's speech attacking the media was positive in certain quarters of America, through unlike Nixon's \\"silent majority speech\\" where he professed to be speaking on behalf of the \\"silent majority\\", Agnew's speech was intentionally meant to be provocative and polarizing. As Nixon's public approval ratings soared, he told his aides in a meeting in the Oval Office: \\"We've got those liberal bastards on the run now, and we're going to keep them on the run\\". On November 13, in Des Moines, Agnew lashed out in a speech against the Moratorium declaring that it was all the work of the media who were \\"a small and unelected elite that do not-I repeat do not-represent the view of America'. Agnew accused the media of being biased against Nixon and for the peace movement, and further stated his belief that the media \\"to a man\\" represented \\"the geographic and intellectual confines of New York and Washington\\". Agnew in particular singled out The New York Times and The Washington Post for criticism. Second Moratorium =Developments= In early November 1969, two disclosures put the wind back into the sails of the antiwar movement. Colonel Robert Rheault of the U.S. Army Special Forces was charged with ordering the murder of a South Vietnamese official suspected of being a Viet Cong spy, which was described euphemistically in an Army report as \\"termination with extreme prejudice\\". More shockingly to the American people, it was revealed on November 12, 1969 by the journalist Seymour Hersh that on March 16, 1968 Lieutenant William Calley commanding the Charlie Company had ordered the My Lai Massacre, which led to Calley being charged with murder.Karnow, Stanley Vietnam: A History, New York: Viking Press, 1983 p.600-601. The My Lai massacre become a symbol to the anti-war movement of the brutality of the Vietnam war, and much of the success of the second Moratorium march was due to the revelation of the My Lai massacre. Karnow described the United States by the fall of 1969 as being very much a polarized and divided nation with about roughly half of the nation supporting Nixon's policies in Vietnam and the other half opposed. =March= The first nationwide Moratorium was followed on Saturday, November 15, 1969, by a second massive Moratorium march in Washington, D.C., which attracted over 500,000 demonstrators against the war, including many performers and activists. This massive Saturday march and rally was preceded by the March against Death, which began on Thursday evening and continued throughout that night and all the next day. Over 40,000 people gathered to parade silently down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House. Hour after hour, they walked in single file, each bearing a placard with the name of a dead American soldier or a destroyed Vietnamese village. The march was silent except for the playing of six drums, which played funereal tunes. The marchers finished in front of the Capitol building, where the placards were placed in coffins. Despite his public disdain, Nixon watched the march on television, staying up until 11 pm as he obsessively watched the demonstration outside of the White House and tried to count how people were participating, eventually reaching the figure of 325,000.Lannguth, A.J. Our Vietnam, New York: Simon & Schuster 2000 p.594-595 Nixon joked that he should send helicopters to blow out the candles. The vast majority of demonstrators during these days were peaceful; however, late on Friday, conflict broke out at DuPont Circle, and the police sprayed the crowd with tear gas. The people of Washington, D.C., generously opened schools, seminaries, and other places of shelter to the thousands of students and others who converged for this purpose. In addition, the Smithsonian Museum complex was opened to allow protesters a place to sleep. A daytime march before the White House was lined by parked tour buses and uniformed police officers, some flashing peace symbols on the inside of their jackets in a show of support for the crowd. The second Moratorium drew an even larger crowd than the first, and it is considered to have been the largest demonstration ever in Washington, D.C.Lannguth, A.J. Our Vietnam, New York: Simon & Schuster 2000 p.595 The Woodstock Music Festival had drawn about 400,000 people in August 1969, and it was estimated by some that the second Moratorium had brought out a number equal to \\"two Woodstocks\\". President Richard Nixon said about the march, \\"Now, I understand that there has been, and continues to be, opposition to the war in Vietnam on the campuses and also in the nation. As far as this kind of activity is concerned, we expect it; however, under no circumstances will I be affected whatever by it.\\" On Moratorium Day, half a million demonstrators gathered across from the White House for a rally where they were led by Pete Seeger in singing John Lennon's new song \\"Give Peace A Chance\\" for ten minutes or more. His voice above the crowd, Seeger interspersed phrases like, \\"Are you listening, Nixon?\\", \\"Are you listening, Agnew?\\", \\"Are you listening, Pentagon?\\" between the choruses of protesters singing, \\"All we are saying ... is give peace a chance\\".See, for example, this PBS documentary and this recording. Others who joined the second Moratorium included the composer Leonard Bernstein, the folk music group Peter, Paul and Mary, the singer John Denver, the folk musician Arlo Guthrie and the Cleveland String Quartet who all played for the crowd. Four touring companies arrived to perform songs from the hippie musical Hair. After the main demonstration about 10,000 protesters headed to the Justice Department. When rocks and sticks were thrown at the building, police responded with a massive tear gas attack while other police units blocked Constitution Avenue. Two thousand people trying to get between the Museum of Natural History and a concrete underpass could move no faster than a very slow walk. Big clouds of tear gas covered the crowd. Police fired more cannisters of gas into the air so that they landed and exploded in the midst of the crowd on the feet and clothing of the retreating demonstrators.https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1969/11/17/police-tear-gas- routs-demonstrators-in/ In San Francisco, over a quarter million of people took part in the march against the war on November 15. The school boards in San Francisco refused permission for high school students to take part in the second moratorium, declaring that the moratorium was \\"unpatriotic\\". As a result, over 50% of the students in San Francisco high schools missed classes on November 14, as they instead went out to protest against the war the day before the march.Moratorium Day: When anti-Vietnam War march brought out ‚Äòsquares‚Äô and students. SF Chronicle https://www.sfchronicle.com/chronicle_vault/article/Moratorium-Day-When-anti- Vietnam-War-march-14501388.php =Aftermath= Activists at some universities continued to hold monthly \\"Moratoria\\" on the 15th of each month. Australian Moratoriums =Background= Following the success of the November 1969 Moratorium in the United States, a series of citizen groups opposed to the war in Vietnam decided to band together to put on a Moratorium in Australia. Late in 1969, they formed the Vietnam Moratorium Campaign or VMC, which had its own executive, a permanent secretary and a number of affiliated organizations. The group that claims credit for mooting the idea is the Congress for International Co-operation and Disarmament (or CICD), a pacifist organization formed out of the Melbourne Peace Congress of 1959. The VMC and CICD certainly shared a number of members, among them Jim Cairns, who was made Chairman, and John Lloyd, secretary of both organizations. The VMC was, however, a much more representative body, including a wide variety of pre-existing Australian groups: Church groups, Trade Unions, radical and moderate student organizations, pacifist groups and anti-war groups. The VMC inherited the CICD's interstate connections with the Association for International Co- operation and Disarmament (its NSW equivalent), the Campaign for Peace in Vietnam (SA) and the Queensland Peace Council for International Co-Operation and Disarmament, giving it a truly national character. The structure of the Moratorium, in Victoria at least, was conflicted - the VMC executive vied for control with the Richmond Town Hall mass public meetings, which could involve up to 600 members and usually went late into the evening, full of arguments over slogans and policies. Vietnam Moratorium protesters in the City Square, Melbourne, September 18, 1970 =Moratoriums= Work began quickly to organize the Moratorium. The original date was set for April 1970, but changed soon after to May 8, 9 and 10, to coincide with protests in the US, just days after the killings of four students at Kent State.

Similar demonstrations were held in Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide and Hobart. Across Australia, it was estimated that 200,000 people were involved. The Australian, May 9, 1970, estimated the crowd as 100,000. Also Strangio, Paul. \\"Farewell to a conscience of the nation\\", The Age, 2003-10-13.

It is situated near Kivik in the southeastern portion of Scania, Sweden. The site is what remains of an unusually grand Nordic Bronze Age double burial c. 1400 BC.Bredar√∂r i Kivik (Joakim Goldhahn, Department of Archaeology, University of Gothenburg) Site The site is located about from the shore of the eastern coast of Scania. These two burials are unique. In both construction and in size‚Äîit is a circular site measuring in diameter‚Äîthis tomb differs from most European burials from the Bronze Age. Most importantly, the cists are adorned with petroglyphs. The images carved into the stones depict people, animals (including birds and fish), ships, lurs being played, symbols and a chariot drawn by two horses and having four-spoked wheels. History Reconstructed entrance to the tomb The site was used as a quarry for construction materials until 1748, when two farmers discovered a tomb, with a north-south orientation, constructed with ten slabs of stone. Still, the quarrying continued and some of the stones disappeared. In 1756 the site was analyzed by antiquarian and archaeologist Nils Wessman (1712-1763). Wessman had undertaken extensive trips to Scania in the 1740s and 1750s for archaeological investigations. The site was excavated by archaeologist Gustaf Hallstr√∂m (1880‚Äì1962) starting in 1931. From 1925 until his retirement in 1945, Hallstr√∂m worked as an antiquarian at the Swedish National Heritage Board (Riksantikvarie√§mbetet). Between 1931‚Äì1933, a thorough excavation was undertaken and the remains of a Stone Age settlement was found under the massive cairn, including a great deal of flintstone shards. Only teeth, fragments of bronze, and some pieces of bone were found, dating from the Bronze Age. Gustaf Hallstr√∂ms arkiv (Research Archives, Ume√• University) The mound contained two cists. On the left side of the cist's southern end, there were raised slabs of stone from a long and wide cist. It was named the King's Grave due to its size, long before it was known to contain two burials. Since the site has been subject to numerous lootings, there are no reliable finds, but it is believed that the two graves were built at the same time. After the excavation, the tomb was restored, but no one knows whether it looks similar to its original state. A comparison with other contemporaneous graves suggests that the site might have been three times higher than the as restored. The restoration was based on etchings from the 18th century and conjecture. A new chamber was constructed out of concrete and a tunnel extended into the cists. Today, it is possible for visitors to the site to enter the tomb and to see the engraved stones.

The blinds then remove their bets, ending the hand. Chopping the blinds is a common occurrence in live ring games, whereas it is not allowed in tournament play (the small blind must raise, call or fold and cannot reclaim their bet), and is seldom, if ever, possible in play on the internet.  Why players chop  Players generally chop for one of two reasons. #Many players do not enjoy playing heads-up, and would rather play multi-way pots, so if the first few players at a table fold rather than calling the big blind, the entire table may fold. In this case, chopping is more of a social custom. #Chopping allows the blinds to avoid paying the rake for a hand that is unlikely to develop into a large pot. In this case, chopping is more of an economic decision. In higher limit games, players tend to be tighter, and it is more common for everyone to fold to the blinds. In this case, chopping would occur so frequently that it would be pointless. Furthermore, higher limit games are much more likely to be short- handed. Finally, the rake in higher limit games is usually much smaller in comparison to the size of the pot, and if a collection is taken instead of a rake, this removes the economic reason for chopping. For all these reasons, chopping is much more common in lower limit games than in higher limit games.  Ethics of chopping  While chopping is a very common practice, some players feel it is antithetical to the nature of poker, especially in short- handed games. Mason Malmuth gives the following reasons why he believes chopping damages a poker game: #Chopping creates the illusion of partnerships. #Chopping takes the killer instinct out of the game. #Chopping allows a tight player to play ante-free. #Chopping creates confusion and hard feelings. #Chopping ruins short-handed games. Many of these reasons overlap. For example, players who know each other tend to chop more often. This sometimes encourages these players to chop on future betting rounds, when everyone else has left the pot. This can be very confusing for other players, as it can give the illusion of partnership and collusion, even if such collusion is unintended.  General etiquette  There are some general guidelines that have developed in regard to chopping the blinds, which are as follows: #The decision whether to chop or not should be made prior to the hand being dealt. Specifically, the decision to chop should not be based on the strength of one's cards. Otherwise, players would only chop their weak blind hands when it comes around to them. #Generally, a player should adhere to a consistent chopping policy for each game they play. For example, a common chopping policy which many players adopt for community card games such as Texas hold 'em is to always chop if there are at least 6 players dealt in, and to never chop if there are fewer than 6 players dealt in. Another common policy is simply never to chop at all. The important point is that a player's chopping policy should be made public and should be consistent whenever they play. If a player decides to deviate from his or her usual chopping policy for a single hand or a single session, this should be publicly announced. Players who constantly change their chopping policy from session to session, or worse, from hand to hand, in order to secure an advantage, are generally considered to be engaging in unethical behaviour.

Lord Clanricarde was a Catholic Royalist, who had overall command of the Irish forces during the later stages of the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. He was created Marquess of Clanricarde in 1646. Background He was the son of Richard Burke, 4th Earl of Clanricarde by his wife Frances Walsingham. Ulick's father was from an Anglo-Norman family who had been long settled in the west of Ireland and had become Gaelicised. Although during the early sixteenth century the family had rebelled against the Crown on several occasions, Ulick's father had been a strong supporter of Queen Elizabeth I. He fought on the Queen's side during Tyrone's Rebellion, notably during the victory at the Battle of Kinsale, where he was wounded. After the war he married the widow of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, a recent commander in Ireland, who was the daughter of the English Secretary of State and spymaster Sir Francis Walsingham. Family  In 1622, Ulick married Lady Anne Compton, the daughter of William Compton, 1st Earl of Northampton and his wife, Elizabeth Spencer. They had a single child, Lady Margaret Burke (died 14 August 1698), who married: *firstly Charles MacCarty, Viscount Muskerry, and had issue including Charles, 3rd Earl of Clancarty, *secondly Robert Villiers, son of Robert Danvers or Villiers, who was himself the suppositious son of John Villiers, 1st Viscount Purbeck, by whom she had further issue, *thirdly the notorious rake and soldier of fortune Robert Fielding (nicknamed Beau Fielding). After her death Fielding made a scandalous and bigamous marriage to the former royal mistress Barbara Palmer, 1st Duchess of Cleveland, having only two weeks earlier married Mary Wadsworth in the mistaken belief that she was an heiress. Early career  Ulick was summoned to the House of Lords as Lord Burgh in 1628, and succeeded his father as 5th Earl of Clanricarde in 1635. In 1636, he inherited Somerhill House on the death of his father. (p 332, p 333) He was a staunch opponent of the policies of the Lord Deputy of Ireland, Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, who had attempted to seize much of the great Burke inheritance in Connacht for the Crown; there was also personal ill-feeling between the two men since the dispute was thought by many to have hastened the death of Ulick's elderly father. He sat in the Short Parliament of 1640 and attended King Charles I on the Scottish expedition. Charles, unlike Strafford, liked and trusted Lord Clanricarde. Wars of the Three Kingdoms Somerhill was sequestered by Parliament in 1645, following the Battle of Naseby. During the Irish Confederate Wars, Lord Clanricarde supported the Royalist leader Ormonde in defending Ireland for Charles I against the Parliamentarians by uniting Catholic and Protestant nobles (he being Catholic). He did not join the Catholic Confederate Ireland, but instead helped to broker a military alliance between the Confederates and English Royalists. He commanded the forces of this alliance during the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, after Lord Ormonde fled the country, and soldiers of his Connaught army helped to win a minor victory at the Battle of Tecroghan. Only a few months later, however, his army was wiped out during the Battle of Meelick Island. Clanricarde was a skillful diplomat but not a great soldier. Like Ormonde, Clanricarde was distrusted by most Catholics in Ireland (he was widely considered to be a friend of the notorious Charles Coote) and thus was thus not capable of halting the Parliamentarian conquest of the country. He was also widely regarded as a man whose actions were governed almost entirely by self-interest. Later life In 1652, he made peace with the victorious Oliver Cromwell. He lost his lands in the Act of Settlement 1652 but his heirs regained them after the Restoration of Charles II in the Act of Settlement 1662.

The program has consisted of: * RADARSAT-1 (1995‚Äì2013) * RADARSAT-2 (2007‚Äì) * RADARSAT Constellation (2019-)  Overview  = RADARSAT-1 = The RADARSAT-1 project consisted of collaboration between the Canadian federal government and provinces, the United States, and the private sector. RADARSAT-1 was launched by NASA on November 4, 1995, although it was owned and controlled by the Canadian Space Agency. The project had a projected lifetime of 5 years, but operated for 18 years before failing in 2013. The goal of this project was to produce a satellite for earth observation by way of a Synthetic Aperture Radar, which is an advanced radar sensor and powerful microwave instrument capable of producing high quality images of the Earth during day or night and across a wide range of weather conditions including cloud cover, smoke, and haze. As a result of the versatility of RADARSAT-1, it has proven highly beneficial to both commercial and scientific users. = RADARSAT-2 = RADARSAT-2 was constructed with several improvements over the RADARSAT-1 project, making it one of the most advanced radar imaging satellites in the world. Some of the improvements over RADARSAT-1 include increased spatial resolution, multiple polarization filters, solid state recorders, and GPS receivers on board. = RADARSAT Constellation = Main article: RADARSAT Constellation RADARSAT Constellation was constructed in order to make improvements on the previous model (RADARSAT-2). This rendition will use a constellation of three small satellites to provide greater coverage while minimizing service interruptions. This system allows for one of the three satellites to pass over an exact location every 4 days in comparison to the 24 day time frame of its predecessors. RADARSAT Constellation has an orbit around Earth at 600km making a full pass every 96 minutes with each of the three satellites separated by a span of 32 minutes. The mission aims to aide with disaster management as well as monitor ecosystems. RADARSAT International RADARSAT International (RSI) was formed in 1989 to market, process, and distribute data from RADARSAT-1. It was owned by a consortium of aerospace companies consisting of MDA, Spar Aerospace, COM DEV International, and Lockheed Martin. RSI provided Earth-observation data and derived information products from RADARSAT-1 along with data from other commercially available Earth-observation satellites including Landsat 4, Landsat 5, Landsat 7, IKONOS, IRS, ERS, QuickBird, and ENVISAT. In 1999, MDA completed a buyout of the other RSI shareholders and incorporated the company as MDA Geospatial Services Inc. (MDA GSI), a wholly owned subsidiary. MDA GSI holds the operating license for RADARSAT-2 under contract from the Canadian Space Agency.  Main users of RADARSAT data  The Canadian Ice Service (CIS) is one of the largest processors of the RADARSAT data. Once the CIS has processed the data at the Canadian Center for Data Processing (CCTD) in Gatineau, Quebec, it is then provided to clients such as the Canadian Coast Guard (CCG). Since RADARSAT data is readily available in near-real time, it is one of the best source of information to use for coastal monitoring, ship detection and maritime ice navigation.

The town is also in the middle of an important agricultural area, especially for growing strawberries and tomatoes. The largest nearby locality is L√°zaro Cardenas, home to 16,294 people as of the 2010 census. The whole area (6 localities) houses roughly 25,000 people, up from 20,000 in 2000. This is the largest population cluster south of Ensenada within the state. The coast also has many sand dunes, and is a popular place for off-road vehicles. The town is on the west coast of the central Baja California Peninsula, near the Bah√≠a de San Quint√≠n, 300 km (187 mi) south of the San Ysidro-Tijuana international border along Federal Highway 1. The Misi√≥n Santo Domingo de la Frontera lies 20 km north of San Quint√≠n. Business San Quintin is home to the largest agricultural company in Baja California- Los Pinos. History In the 1880s, a British land company with plans for a wheat empire purchased much of the San Quint√≠n area from the US‚Äìbased International Land Company; at the time, ILC owned most of northern Baja. In response to promises of agricultural wealth, around a hundred English colonists purchased subdivided land tracts from the parent company, planted wheat, and constructed a gristmill. For flour transportation, the English built a pier on inner Bahi√° San Quint√≠n and began constructing a railway to link up with the Southern Pacific tracks to the north in California. Thirty kilometers of track were laid, including a rail causeway from the west bank of inner Bahi√° San Quint√≠n, before the colony failed. A 17-ton, six-wheeled locomotive still lies underwater at the mouth of the bay, the remains of a loading accident for the aborted railway. A drought devastated one of the first wheat harvests, and by 1900 all the colonists abandoned San Quint√≠n. Remnants of the gristmill, the railroad causeway, the pier, and an English cemetery still stand along the perimeter of the inner bay. The English names on the cemetery's heavily weathered wooden crosses have faded from sight, and more recent Mexican graves are beginning to crowd out their neglected English counterparts. Recently there has been foreign (especially Chinese) investment in San Quintin for the development of shellfish harvesting and export (especially abalone). A tourist hotel is also planned. San Quintin has been running an abalone conservation project, a project to repopulate depleted areas and prevent extinction. The conservation process involves farm growing abalone for two-three years and put back into its natural habitat. Farmers wait three years after that, and abalone is extracted for commercialization. On October 28, 2015 residents voted 17,580 to 7,548 in favor of San Quintin becoming its own municipality. On February 27, 2020 San Quintin separated from the municipality of Ensenada and became the state's sixth municipality. The agricultural plain roughly 50 kilometers from Camalu to Vicente Carranza, recorded a total of roughly 80,000 people in 2010. Climate The temperatures tend to run warmer in summer and cooler in winter compared to San Diego, but out along the Pacific Ocean coastline about 5 miles west of San Quintin, the climate is virtually identical to San Diego's weather, year- round.  Aquaculture  Fishing in the San Quintin Bay In the realm of aquaculture, there are immense possibilities for growth. The extensive shoreline along the Pacific and the Sea of Cortes is in ideal condition, both biologically and economically speaking. The development and adaptation of aquaculture technology by Baja Californian institutions and the vocation of cultivating marine fish and mollusks have influenced the practice, making it a reality in present-day Baja California. Due to the development in the cultivation of oysters, mussels and abalones, aquaculture has secured its place in the fishing industry and the demand for fishing products is increasing on a global scale. Baja California is a pioneer in the practice and at the forefront in aquaculture. Natural resources are at their maximum exploitation or have entered over-exploitation. Aquaculture has proved to be an answer to this crisis, as it is the area in the primary food sector where there are significant records of growth. Fishing has become a tradition for many in Baja California, being distinguished worldwide for its high quality and variety. Business is conducted with distant locations such as Europe and Asia in addition to the United States and parts of Mexico. There is infrastructure in fisheries of all kinds, including technological, scientific, and specialized educational infrastructure. Ensenada has many processing plants, canning machines, freezers, as well as fresh and live products, and gel production from seaweed. Several factories produce packages of different materials, such as tin cans, cardboard boxes, and extracted polyethylene packaging. The adjacent industrial areas in Baja California also facilitate the acquisition of equipment and spare parts. There are shipyards and workshops to support the fishing industry as well as prestigious research centers for aquaculture that prepare students from a specialized secondary education, through technology programs in high school focusing on oceanography, to doctoral degrees in science. Resources have increased substantially in recent years, considering the aquaculture industry in Baja California began just two decades ago. To date, significant progress has already been made, with the greatest development being the cultivation of the oyster in San Quint√≠n, with Ostiones Guerrero, SA de CV being the oldest and largest producer of both Pacific Gigas and Kumamoto oysters in Bahia Falsa and home to La Ostionera, its signature restaurant on the bay where locals and tourists alike come to enjoy fresh oysters and other \\"mariscos\\". The local oyster harvests produce over 1000 tons annually as well as mussels, abalone and other local species. The Bahia Falsa is certified by the Food and Drug Administration of the United States which guarantees the quality of the products and facilitates the commercial concurrence to the markets of that country. Another view of the San Quintin Bay Recently, Ostiones Guerrero, SA de CV signed a collaboration agreement with Stellar Biotechnologies of Port Hueneme, California to grow giant keyhole limpets (megathura crenulata) at their aquaculture facilities at La Chorera, constructed for abalone farming. Under this collaboration, the animals will be grown for the extraction of a rare blood protein from the limpets called KLH, used in immunotherapy treatments of cancer, lupus, Alzheimers and in early stages of clinical trials for treatment of diabetes. In addition to the natural wealth and the relative absence of pollution, it shares a border with a California, an important market. The most diverse shipments of seafood from Baja California cross the international border between Tijuana, B.C. and San Diego, California. The Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) is located 138 miles from the border with Mexico. From there, regular shipments of live fish and fresh seafood are made, using a route from the Baja California fishing fields ending at the Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo, Japan.

Roosevelt on post World War II foreign policy. Predecessors included the similar Advisory Committee on Problems of Foreign Relations and the Division of Special Research. It was created by Secretary of State Cordell Hull at the suggestion of his assistant Leo Pasvolsky and Norman Davis of the Council on Foreign Relations.Shoup & Minter, p.148 The committee appointed subcommittees on political problems, economic reconstruction, territorial matters, legal questions and the creation of an international organization, all under the direction of Pasvolsky. After four sessions, the main committee disbanded, Hull preferring to rely on the smaller subcommittees. Chairman of the committee was Secretary of State Cordell Hull; vice chairman, Under Secretary of State Sumner Welles, Dr. Leo Pasvolsky (director of the Division of Special Research) was appointed Executive Officer. The committee included Dean Acheson, Esther C. Brunauer, Lauchlin Currie, Laurence Duggan, Herbert Feis, Alger Hiss, Harry Hawkins, Philip Jessup, Archibald MacLeish, Charles W. Yost, George C. Marshall, Henry Wadleigh, Henry Agard Wallace, and Harry Dexter White. Several experts were brought in from outside the State Department, mostly members of the Council on Foreign Relations such as Hamilton Fish Armstrong, Isaiah Bowman, Benjamin V. Cohen, Norman H. Davis, Anne O'Hare McCormick, James T. Shotwell and Myron Taylor.Shoup & Minter, p.152 The international organizations subcommittee, the Special Subcommittee on International Organization included Welles, Bowman, Pasvolsky, Cohen, Shotwell, Notter, Green Hackworth, the State Department legal adviser and later Clark Eichelberger of the League of Nations Association, and eventually produced a draft charter of a new international organization. The economic policy subcommittee was led by Dean Acheson, and the economic reconstruction subcommittee by Adolph Berle. From March 1942, the committee was supplied with research secretaries by the Council on Foreign Relations' War and Peace Studies project, with each subcommittee being served by the secretary of a corresponding Council study group. Meetings were scheduled to allow secretaries to carry out Council work during the first half of each week with the remainder of the week spent at the State Department. In early 1943, as the committee declined in importance, much of its work was taken over by the Informal Political Agenda Group composed of Hull, Welles, Taylor, Davis, Bowman and Pasvolsky.

Dennis Franz portrayed the character for its entire run.Dennis Franz Character overview Sipowicz was a New York City police detective working in the detective squad of the fictitious 15th Precinct of the NYPD, placed on the lower east side of Manhattan.The real 15th Precinct, which closed in 1964, was in midtown Manhattan, with a station house at 160 East 35th Street. Its area was subsequently absorbed by the 13th and 17th Precincts. Precincts in Manhattan were originally numbered from south to north, with odd numbered precincts being on the east side of Manhattan and even numbered precincts on the west side. The number \\"15\\" is thus too high for a precinct on the Lower East Side, which is in fact covered by the 7th and 9th Precincts. He was the central character of the show during its twelve-year run, and the only one to have been a regular cast member in every episode. (Detective Greg Medavoy (Gordon Clapp) did not appear until episode 3 of the first season and did not become a regular until the start of season 2.) In October 2018, creators Jesse Bochco, Matt Olmstead, and Nick Wootton revealed that the pilot for an NYPD Blue sequel was in production. The sequel will focus on Andy Sipowicz's son Theo, who has joined the police department and earns promotion to detective while trying to solve the murder of his father. Background and personality Jason Gay of The Boston Phoenix described Sipowicz as a \\"drunken, racist goon with a heart of gold\\" who was \\"the moral core\\" of NYPD Blue. In 1997, he described Sipowicz as becoming \\"sobered up\\" but said Sipowicz \\"won't ever go totally soft.\\" Gay describes Dennis Franz as adding \\"underrated, edgy mixture of grit and sensitivity\\" to Sipowicz.\\"Detective Andy Sipowicz ,\\" The Boston Phoenix According to a second- season episode aired in 1995, Sipowicz was about to celebrate his 47th birthday on April 7, implying he was born in 1948. (This would make the character three and a half years younger than the actor.) He is from Brooklyn, where he worked in a local candy store as a boy, later returning under sad conditions when a son of the shop owners organized a robbery that led to his mother's death. Both his mother and father were of Polish origin and had blue- collar backgrounds. His father was an alcoholic whose frequent drunkenness cost him his job as a meter reader. He defiantly returned to finish his route after dark, but was stabbed in the eye by a black man who mistook him for a robber. He claimed that the black man had tried to rob him; Andy grew up hearing the story, which was the basis for his racism. In season 6, however, he realizes that his father was lying, and begins to question the values he was raised with. Before becoming a policeman, Sipowicz served in the U.S. Army, including an 18-month tour in Vietnam that he did not talk much about; however, it is an underlying theme in the show. He once became incensed when an obnoxious fellow cop named Sgt. Ray Kahlins, also a Vietnam veteran, lied about being in combat, and told Kahlins he could lie to his heart's content about anything else, but not about his Vietnam War service. Although the precise year is not stated, he joined the NYPD \\"right out of 'Nam\\" (as referenced in episode 4 of season 4),thus making his entrance to the force most likely no later than 1973. While in uniform, Sipowicz served under Al Angelotti, then a sergeant, in the 25th precinct. One of his early police assignments was infiltrating the Black Panthers organization and posing as a white leftist radical. These events accentuated his already-developing racist tendencies. In 1979, Sipowicz received the gold shield of Detective Third Grade (the \\"beginning\\" rank) and briefly worked in the Robbery Squad before transferring to the 15th in the same year.NYPD Blue season 8, episode 9, \\"Oh Golly Goth\\" He was promoted to Second Grade at an unknown time prior to the start of the series in fall 1993, and was promoted to First Grade in late 2001. Sipowicz carries a .38 caliber Smith & Wesson Model 36 five-shot revolver as his main sidearm. This shows his \\"old school\\" approach as most of his fellow officers carry Glock pistols. The Model 36 was at one time an approved sidearm for NYPD Detectives until the switch to semi autos in 1994. Older officers were allowed to retain their revolvers if they so chose. Role within the show In the first season of NYPD Blue, Sipowicz's partner is John Kelly, who leaves the force in 1994 after withholding evidence in a murder investigation of his lover Janice Licalsi. After Kelly's resignation, Bobby Simone becomes Sipowicz's partner. They soon become best friends; Sipowicz is devastated when Simone dies of a heart infection. In 1994, Andy begins to date Assistant District Attorney Sylvia Costas, with whom he previously clashed due to professional differences (Sipowicz calls her a \\"pissy little bitch\\" in the pilot episode). They get married in 1995 and have a son, Theo, in 1996. Andy was married to Katie Sipowicz for 11 years and they had a son, Andy Jr. (born 1973). However, by 1993 both his ex-wife and son were estranged from him, due to his heavy drinking. After being shot six times in an ambush by a mobster named Alphonse Giardella and almost dying, Sipowicz decides to change his life. He stops drinking, focuses on the job, and rebuilds his relationship with his son. On his route to becoming a better man, Sipowicz struggles to overcome his bigotry with the help of his black detective squad commander, Lieutenant Arthur Fancy, and Simone. He also eventually comes to terms with his homophobia, mainly due to his initially grudging friendship with precinct Police Administrative Assistant John Irvin. With the birth of his second son, Sipowicz's life seems to be going well. However, a series of devastating personal tragedies over the next few years arise: in May 1996, Andy Jr., who is about to start work as a policeman in Hackensack, New Jersey, is shot and killed while trying to stop a robbery. The shooting sends Andy Sr. into an alcoholic relapse, during which Sylvia briefly throws him out of the house. In November 1998, Bobby Simone dies of an infection caused by heart transplant complications, and less than a year later in May 1999, Sylvia is accidentally killed by the distraught father of PAA Dolores Mayo (whose killer she had been prosecuting) in a courtroom. This is then followed by the disappearance and subsequent murder of Simone's successor Danny Sorenson during an undercover assignment in 2001. He also survives a serious bout with prostate cancer in 1998. With the exception of Andy Jr.'s death, however, Sipowicz remains sober in the face of all of these tragedies. He also has to deal with the fact that he had been instrumental in putting an innocent black man in prison for 18 years for the murder of a teenager, remembering that he had no experience as a detective and deferred to a lazy veteran cop. He is the only cop to apologize when the man is released (he learns that the perpetrator was a white man who later died of a drug overdose, and while Sipowicz and the now-retired veteran cop basically knew he'd been murdered, the end result of the case was left unresolved). In 2003, Sipowicz marries for the third time, this time to a fellow detective named Connie McDowell, who had recently joined the squad. The year before, Connie's pregnant sister is killed by her abusive husband. The baby survives, so Connie and Sipowicz take custody of the child and name her Michelle, after her mother. Soon after, Connie, who had believed she could not have children due to scarring of her Fallopian tubes, becomes pregnant and gives birth to a baby boy named Matthew. With two infants to raise, Connie resigns from the police force to be a stay-at-home mother. Later that year, Sipowicz overcomes a personality clash with new Lt. Thomas Bale, is promoted to sergeant, and persuades a reluctant chief of detectives to name him the new squad commander. Sipowicz would have reached the mandatory NYPD retirement age of 63 in 2011 and, in the unaired pilot for a planned revival of the show, was murdered by an unknown assailant in 2019 at the age of 71.https://tvline.com/2019/08/05/nypd-blue-revival-pilot-abc-cancelled/ \\"The Sipowicz\\" Sipowicz was often portrayed in a tie and short sleeved shirt, coining the term \\"The Sipowicz\\" to describe such attire.

During his tenure in the United States House of Representatives, he was included in several lists of Fire-Eaters--men who adamantly urged the secession of southern states from the United States, and who resisted measures of compromise and reconciliation, leading to the American Civil War. Keitt is notable for being involved in two separate acts of legislative violence in the Congressional chambers. In the first, Keitt assisted Representative Preston Brooks (D-SC) in his 1856 attack on Senator Charles Sumner (R-MA) in the Senate chamber by brandishing a pistol and cane to prevent other Senators from coming to Sumner's aid. The second was in 1858, when he attacked and attempted to choke Representative Galusha Grow (R-PA) during an argument on the floor of the U.S. House. When the Civil War began, he served as a deputy of the Provisional Confederate States Congress and later as a colonel in the Confederate States Army, until he was mortally wounded at the Battle of Cold Harbor in June 1864.  Early life and education  Keitt was born at Puritan Farm in Orangeburg County (present-day Calhoun County, South Carolina). He graduated from South Carolina College in 1843, studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1845, and practiced in Orangeburg.  Career  = Early career = A member of the Democratic Party, he served in the South Carolina House of Representatives from 1848 to 1853. From 1853 to 1856, he served in the U.S. House of Representative from South Carolina's 3rd District. = Caning of Charles Sumner = Keitt was censured by the House in 1856 for aiding Rep. Preston Brooks in his Caning of Charles Sumner. Brooks had considered challenging Sumner to a duel after Sumner's anti-slavery The Crime Against Kansas speech, which Brooks interpreted as an insult to his cousin, Senator Andrew Butler. After consulting with Keitt and deciding that Sumner was no gentleman, and therefore not worthy of a duel, Brooks resolved to beat Sumner with a cane instead. With Keitt and Virginia Representative Henry A. Edmundson on hand to assist, on May 22, 1856, Brooks entered the Senate chamber and began beating the defenseless Sumner with his gold-headed cane, while Edmundson and Keitt prevented others from stopping Brooks or aiding Sumner. Keitt drew a pistol from his belt and brandished his own cane, holding off the horror-struck senators who tried to assist Sumner, loudly announcing \\"Let them be!\\" In July, the House censured Keitt for his part in the attack. He resigned in order to create a vacancy that would be filled by special election, thus giving his constituents the opportunity to ratify or condemn his conduct. They supported Keitt's actions, overwhelmingly returning him to Congress in the August special election. He served until December 1860, when South Carolina seceded from the Union. = Later career = On February 5, 1858, Keitt started a massive brawl on the House floor during a tense late-night debate. Keitt, offended by Pennsylvania Congressman (and later Speaker of the House) Galusha A. Grow, a Republican, having stepped over to the Democratic side of the House chamber, dismissively demanded that Grow sit down, calling him a \\"black Republican puppy\\". Grow responded by telling Keitt that \\"No negro- driver shall crack his whip over me.\\" Keitt became enraged and went for Grow's throat, shouting that he would \\"choke [him] for that\\". A large brawl involving approximately 50 representatives erupted on the House floor, ending only when a missed punch from Rep. Cadwallader Washburn of Wisconsin upended the hairpiece of Rep. William Barksdale of Mississippi. The embarrassed Barksdale accidentally replaced the wig backwards, causing both sides to erupt in spontaneous laughter.Congressional Globe. 35th Cong., 1st sess. 8 Feb. 1858. 603. Perhaps Keitt's most famous quotation best summarized his political views and dominant agenda. In 1860, Congressman Keitt said, \\"The anti-slavery party contends that slavery is wrong in itself, and the government is a consolidated national democracy. We of the South contend that slavery is right, and that this is a confederate republic of sovereign states.\\" After South Carolina's secession Keitt served as a delegate to the Provisional Confederate Congress from 1861 to 1862.  American Civil War and death  Keitt later joined the Confederate States Army, and attained the rank of colonel as commander of the 20th South Carolina Volunteer Infantry Regiment. He later commanded Kershaw's Brigade, succeeding to this position after Kershaw advanced to command of a division. Mortally wounded at the Battle of Cold Harbor on June 1, 1864, Keitt died the next day near Richmond, Virginia. He is buried at West End Cemetery in St. Matthews, South Carolina.

He was the brother of Johann Christoph Bach, as well as first cousin, once removed and father-in-law of Johann Sebastian Bach (he was the father of J.S. Bach's first wife Maria Barbara Bach). He is sometimes referred to as the \\"Gehrener Bach\\" to distinguish him from the \\"Wuppertaler Bach\\", Johann Michael Bach (1745‚Äì1820).Johann Michael Bach, der ¬ªGehrener Bach¬´ (1648-1694), in: Musik und Gottesdienst 1994, 50-57There is a problematic reference to a \\"Johann Michael Bach (1660-1723)\\"(?) born in Arnstadt and organist in Gehren in Allgemeine illustrierte Encyklop√§die der Musikgeschichte 1902 ed Hermann Ritter \\"(Johann Michael Bach, der 1660 in Arnstadt geboren wurde, war Organist und Stadtschreiber in Gehren [F√ºrstentum Schwarzburg-Sondershausen], wo er 1723 starb\\" This appears to be a misprint, since the dates of birth are not of the \\"Gehrener Bach\\" but of Johann Lorenz Stauber (1660-1723)Provokation und Tradition: Hans-Martin Linde, Regula Rapp - 2000 \\"Hier bot sich nun endlich die Gelegenheit, Johann Michael Bach (II) als den ,Wuppertaler' Bach vorzustellen, als der er sich f√ºr uns inzwischen erwiesen hatte und dessen Kantate wir im Januar 1986 beiseite gelegt hatten. \\"Hugo Riemann (1849-1919): Leben, Werk und Wirkung Michael Arntz - 1999 \\"Es gab sogar noch einen weiteren b√ºhnentauglichen Schreiber in der Dynastie, Johann Michael Bach hie√ü er, ... fand sein Auskommen als Musiklehrer eines Gymnasiums im bergischen Elberfeld, heute Wuppertal, wo er 1820 mit 75 Jahren starb.\\" Life Johann Michael was born at Arnstadt, the son of Heinrich Bach, who was the great uncle of Johann Sebastian Bach. In 1673, Johann Michael became the organist and town clerk of Gehren, where he lived until his death. Works His most-performed work is the small chorale prelude for organ, In Dulci Jubilo, which for many years was attributed to J. S. Bach (it was ascribed the catalog number BWV 751). His other most important works include cantatas Ach, bleib bei uns, Herr Jesu Christ (for choir, strings and continuo), Liebster Jesu, h√∂r mein Flehen (for soprano, alto, two tenors, bass, strings and continuo), and Ach, wie sehnlich wart' ich der Zeit (also for soprano, strings, and continuo). *Das Blut Christi *Ach wie sehnlich wart ich der Zeit *Auf, lasst uns den Herren loben *Halt was du hast *F√ºrchtet euch nicht *Sei lieber Tag willkommen *Ich weiss, dass mein Erl√∂ser lebt *Herr, ich warte auf dein Heil *Herr, wenn ich dich nur habe *Unser Leben w√§hret siebenzig Jahre In addition to composing music, J.

Early musical life Goldy was born in San Diego, California. Before Dio, he played in the bands Vengeance, Rough Cutt, and Giuffria. He replaced Jake E. Lee in Rough Cutt and was himself replaced by Amir Derakh. While with Rough Cutt, Goldy played on demos produced by Ronnie James Dio. Giuffria Shortly after leaving Rough Cutt, Goldy would join Giuffria, the eponymous band of former Angel keyboardist, Gregg Giuffria. Performing on Giuffria's self-titled debut album, released in 1984, Goldy is heard on the band's biggest hit, \\"Call to the Heart,\\" which hit #15 on the Billboard charts in early 1985. Dio Goldy performed on the Dio album Dream Evil, but this first stint with the band was short lived and he left due to unknown reasons. In 2000, Goldy returned to Dio and helped record Magica, but shortly thereafter left again due to family commitments. Doug Aldrich replaced him for the album, Killing the Dragon. However, Goldy was back in the Dio fold for what turned out to be the band's final studio album, Master of the Moon, in 2004. Goldy temporarily left the group for the third time in 2005, after suffering a hand injury on tour through Russia. He was again replaced by Doug Aldrich for the duration of the tour. Other projects Goldy was featured in Hear 'n Aid - Stars project while still in Giuffria, alongside other players such as Adrian Smith and Dave Murray of Iron Maiden, Yngwie Malmsteen, Brad Gillis and others. Goldy was the original guitarist of a supergroup consisting of himself, singer Rob Rock, bassist Rudy Sarzo, and drummer Tommy Aldridge. But before the recording of Project Driver, he left the group to join Dio and was subsequently replaced by Tony MacAlpine. After exiting Dio, Goldy formed his own band, Craig Goldy's Ritual, and signed a deal with Grand Slamm Records for the release of Hidden In Plain Sight in 1991. The album featured lead vocals by Goldy's former Guiffria bandmate David Glen Eisley and future Queensr√øche guitarist Mike Stone. Goldy co-wrote the song \\"Lady Luck\\" with David Lee Roth on the latter's 1991 album A Little Ain't Enough. In 1993, Goldy released his first solo album, Insufficient Therapy, on Shrapnel Records, with Jeff Pilson co-writing and contributing lead vocals on 4 songs. A follow-up, the all-instrumental Better Late Than Never, was released in 1995. During that time, Goldy and Pilson also collaborated in a progressive heavy rock project named 13th Floor although no album was ever released. In February 2008 Goldy accompanied Welsh heavy metal pioneers Budgie on their first tour of Australia and subsequently continued playing with the group as 'guest guitarist'. Budgie's live activities came to an abrupt end when vocalist/bassist Burke Shelley was hospitalized on November 9, 2010 in Wejherowo, Poland with an aortic aneurism. Shelley can no longer sing and play at the same time. In 2011, Goldy became a member of Dio Disciples along with former Dio band members Scott Warren, Rudy Sarzo and Simon Wright, and former Judas Priest vocalist Tim \\"Ripper\\" Owens. Goldy and Warren are currently the only members left of the original Dio Disciples line-up. In 2014, Goldy announced a new collaboration with former Quiet Riot vocalist Mark Huff and the release of 2 songs, \\"Hole In My Heart\\" and \\"Dark Rainbow\\", in tribute to his former mentor Ronnie James Dio. The duo has since been joined by Brazilian born bassist Dario Seixas, MSG guitarist/keyboardist Wayne Findlay, and former Cry Wolf drummer Chris Moore. In October 2014, Goldy was announced as part of the 2015 XG Extreme Guitar Tour line-up alongside Uli Jon Roth and Vinnie Moore. Goldy is set to perform with his all-star band Black Knights Rising featuring drummer Vinny Appice, vocalist Mark Boals, keyboardist Allesandro Bertoni, and bassist Elliott Rubinson. In January 2016, Goldy released a new collaboration called Resurrection Kings with drummer Vinny Appice, bassist Sean McNabb and vocalist Chas West. The recording was released January 26, 2016 on Frontiers Records. On 17 September 2018, Goldy's latest project, Dream Child, will release their debut album entitled Until Death Do We Meet Again, on Frontiers Records. The line-up consists of Craig Goldy on guitar, Wayne Findlay on guitars & keys, Rudy Sarzo on bass guitar, Simon Wright on drums & Diego Valdez on vocals. Guitars His main guitar was a B.C. Rich Warlock, however, he now uses an ESP M-II through ENGL Powerball amplifiers. He has modified the guitar by switching the EMG pickups with Seymour Duncan pickups.

He is the reason anyone really even knows who I am at all and why I exist. He rescued me from sleeping in a car on the streets of San Diego and Los Angeles and brought me into his world where dreams come true, kindness to strangers and fans, warmth, humility and integrity are paramount and where creativity could be without boundaries that could change people's lives forever. I know he changed mine.

The name may derive from the wallet that such people carried, but there is no other known derivation. The word appears in several of Sir Walter Scott's books. Gaberlunzies were also known as King's Bedesmen or blue gouns (the gowns were part of the alms given by the monarch). Scott gives an account of the customs and of particular Bedesmen he knew in the introduction to The Antiquary. Scotsman Donald Farfrae uses the word in Thomas Hardy's The Mayor of Casterbridge: \\"There are not perpetual snow and wolves at all in it!‚Äîexcept snow in winter, and‚Äîwell‚Äîa little in summer just sometimes, and a 'gaberlunzie' or two stalking about here and there, if ye may call them dangerous.\\"Hardy, T. (1886), The Mayor of Casterbridge, Chapter 8. The word also makes an appearance in novels in Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey‚ÄìMaturin series - Treason's Harbour and The Hundred Days. The word is also referenced in the Outlander series--Episode 8 of Season 1. A character by the name of Hugh Munro wears many tokens on his chest, granting him permission to beg in different Scottish parishes. It can be spelled gaberlunyie, since the z was originally a yogh.

Designed by Thomas Cubitt and built between 1829 and 1847, it is named after Woburn Abbey, the main country seat of the Dukes of Bedford, who developed much of Bloomsbury. The original construction was of 41 houses, smaller than those of adjoining Gordon Square and hence with lower rents. The square was built on the boundary between the parishes of St. Pancras and Holborn and the boundary marker stones are still visible in the gardens. The two squares were built to improve land that was originally marshland. This narrow square was longer, extending down towards Russell Square, before the southern half and the Lewis Vulliamy designed Christ Church were demolished in the 1970s to make space for new buildings for the School of Oriental and African Studies and the Institute of Education.

His paternal uncle Rev Hiram Watson (1813-1891) was a minister of the Free Church of Scotland and John appears to have chosen to follow in his shoes.Ewing, William Annals of the Free Church He studied at Edinburgh University, then trained as a Free Church minister at New College in Edinburgh, also undertaking some postgraduate study at T√ºbingen. In 1874 he was licensed by the Free Church of Scotland and became assistant minister of Edinburgh Barclay Church. In 1875 he was ordained as minister at Logiealmond in Perthshire. In 1877 he was transferred to St Matthews Free Church in Glasgow. In Glasgow he lived at 44 Windsor Terrace.Glasgow Post Office Directory 1879 In 1880 he became minister of Sefton Park Presbyterian Church in Liverpool, from which he retired in 1905. During this period he was a main mover in the founding of the Westminster College in Cambridge. In 1896 he was Lyman Beecher lecturer at Yale University, and in 1900 he was moderator of the synod of the English Presbyterian Church. While travelling in the United States he died from blood poisoning, following a bout with tonsilitis,Papers Past - Nelson Evening Mail, Volume XLII, 8 May 1907, Page 4 at Mount Pleasant, Iowa. His body was returned to England, and buried in Smithdown Cemetery in Liverpool. Maclaren's first stories of rural Scottish life, Beside the Bonnie Brier Bush (1894), achieved extraordinary popularity, selling more than 700,000 copies, and was succeeded by other successful books, The Days of Auld Lang Syne (1895), Kate Carnegie and those Ministers (1896), and Afterwards and other Stories (1898). By his own name Watson published several volumes of sermons, among them being The Upper Room (1895), The Mind of the Master (1896) and The Potter's Wheel (1897).

Accessed 15 March 2001. was an English Baroque composer, the younger brother or cousin of Henry Purcell. Biography Like Henry Purcell before him, Daniel Purcell joined the choir of the Chapel Royal at about the age of 14. In his mid-twenties he was appointed organist of Magdalen College, Oxford where he began to compose. In 1695 he moved to London to compose for the theatre providing incidental music for more than 40 plays. One of his first engagements was to complete the concluding Masque for Act V of the semi-opera The Indian Queen, the preceding music for which had been written by Henry Purcell during the early months of 1695. It is unclear if Daniel Purcell had been engaged because of pressure to complete the score in time for the first performance or as a result of Henry Purcell's failing health and subsequent death.Robert King 1994 \\"Henry Purcell, a greater musical genius England never had\\" p.219. London: Thames and Hudson. The performance history of the piece is uncertain, and the first performance may have gone ahead without Daniel Purcell's contribution. In 1701, he came third in a competition for the best musical setting of William Congreve's masque, The Judgment of Paris. His instrumental compositions published c.1710 included sets of sonatas and trio sonatas for recorder in addition to works for violin. In 1713, at the age of 49 he was appointed organist of St Andrew's, Holborn, a position he held until his death. He was subsequently buried in St Andrew's Church where he had worked. The most frequently performed of his compositions are probably the Magnificat and Nunc dimittis in E minor, liturgical pieces written for use in the Church of England service of Evensong.

In French Polynesia it has nearly disappeared, except for some villages in the Marquesas. General This tapa cloth was made in Papua New Guinea. Tapa can be made from the inner bark of paper mulberry or breadfruit trees. right The cloth is known by a number of local names although the term tapa is international and understood throughout the islands that use the cloth. The word tapa is from Tahiti and the Cook Islands, where Captain Cook was the first European to collect it and introduce it to the rest of the world. In Tonga, tapa is known as ngatu, and here it is of great social importance to the islanders, often being given as gifts. In Samoa, the same cloth is called siapo, and in Niue it is hiapo. In Hawaii, it is known as kapa. In Rotuma, a Polynesian island in the Fiji group, it is called ‚Äòuha and in other Fiji islands it is called masi. In the Pitcairn islands it was called ahu. It is also known as tapia. All these words give some clue to the origin. Masi could mean the (bark of the) dye-fig (Ficus tinctoria), endemic to Oceania, and probably the one originally used to make tapa. Somewhere in history, during the voyages of migration the hiapo or siapo was introduced from Southeast Asia, the paper mulberry tree (Broussonetia papyrifera). The bark of this tree is much better to use, and put the use of the dye-fig into oblivion. Only its name remained in Fiji. Tapa finally has the meaning of border or strip. It seems likely that before the glueing process became common to make large sheets (see below) only narrow strips were produced. Tapa can be decorated by rubbing, stamping, stencilling, smoking (Fiji: \\"masi Kuvui\\") or dyeing. The patterns of Tongan, Samoan, and Fijian tapa usually form a grid of squares, each of which contains geometric patterns with repeated motifs such as fish and plants, for example four stylised leaves forming a diagonal cross. Traditional dyes are usually black and rust-brown, although other colours are known. In former times the cloth was primarily used for clothing, but now cotton and other textiles have replaced it. The major problem with tapa clothing is that the tissue loses its strength when wet and falls apart. However, it was better than grass-skirts, which usually are either heavier and harder or easily blown apart, but on the low coral atolls where the mulberry does not grow, people had no choice. It is also labour- intensive to manufacture. Tapa cloth was made by both the men and women in ancient times. An example is the Hawaiian men, who also made their own weapons. Nowadays tapa is often worn on formal occasions such as weddings. Another use is as a blanket at night or for room dividers. It is highly prized for its decorative value and is often found hung on walls as decoration. In Tonga a family is considered poor, no matter how much money they have, if they do not have any tapa in stock at home to donate at life events like marriages, funerals and so forth. If the tapa was donated to them by a chief or even the royal family, it is more valuable. It has been used in ceremonial masks in Papua New Guinea and the Cook Islands (Mangian masks). It was used to wrap sacred objects, e.g., \\"God staffs\\" in the Cook Islands.There are also many more uses of tapa which are not mentioned here. Stripping the bark from the trees in Nomuka Fabrication The following describes the fabrication of Tapa cloth in Tonga, where it is still part of daily life. There may be small or large differences for other locations. In Tonga hiapo is the name given to the paper mulberry tree. People have bunches of them growing in a corner of their plantations. They are cut and brought home where the first task is to strip the bark from the trees. The strips are about hand wide and person long. The wood left-over is named mokofute. The bark consists of two layers; the outer bark is scraped or split off from the inner bark. This work is called haalo. The outer bark is discarded; the inner bark, named tutu or loututu, is left-over. It is dried in the sun before being soaked. Nukualofa After this, the bark is beaten on a wooden tutua anvil using wooden mallets called ike. In the beating the bark is made thinner and spread out to a width of about 25 cm. This phase of the work is called tutu (or tutua). The mallets are flat on one side and have coarse and fine grooves on the other sides. First the coarse sides are used and, towards the end of the work, the flat side (tƒÅ-tua). The continuous \\"thonk\\" beats of the tapa mallet is a normal sound in Tongan villages. If several women work together they can make a concert out of it. In that case there might be one who tukipotu, beats the end of the tutua to set the rhythm. Eua When the strips are thin enough, several are taken and beaten together into a large sheet. Some starch from the kumala, or manioke may be rubbed on places which are unwilling to stick. This part of the work is called opoopo, the glue is called tou and the resulting sheet of tapa is called fetaaki. It then consists of two layers of strips in perpendicular direction, the upper one called lauolunga and the lower one laulalo. A knife or sharp shell, named mutu, is used to trim the edges, and the pieces fallen off in this process are called papanaki. When the white fetaaki is smoked brown, it is called sala. Often the women of a whole village work together on a huge sheet of tapa. A donation is made to the church or their chief at an important occasion. Such sheets are about 3 m wide and 15 or 30 m, or sometimes even 60 m long. The 15 meter pieces are called launima (meaning five-sheet, because the sheet is five squares), and the 30 m pieces are called lautefuhi. Ratzel (1896) described the fabrication of tapa as follows: > \\"A circular cut is made with a shell in the bark above the root of the tree; > the tree is broken off, and in a few days, when the stem is half-dry, the > bark and bast are separated from it. The bast is then cleaned and macerated > in water, after which it is beaten with the ribbed club on a wooden block. > This beating enlivens a village in Tonga as threshing does in Europe. In > half an hour the piece will have changed in shape from a strip almost to a > square. The edges are snipped with shells, and a large number of the pieces > are drawn separately over a semi-cylindrical wooden stamp, on which the > pattern, worked in coco-fibre, is stretched and smeared with a fluid at once > adhesive and colouring. On each a second and third layer is placed; and the > piece, three layers thick, is coloured more strongly in the parts which are > thrown into relief by the inequalities of the bed. Others are annexed to it > both at the side and the end, until pieces a yard wide, and 20 to 25 yards > long, are produced. Painting The fetaaki is almost always painted. It then becomes ngatu, the Tongan word for the final product. The painting is done over the whole length, but only the central 2.5 metre in the width direction. On both sides there is an unpainted border of about 20 cm wide, which is called the tapa (in Tonga). To paint it, the sheets are put over a huge wooden drum covered with stencils or kupesi (upeti in Samoa). These stencils are made from coconut front midribs (or any other sticks of a few millimeter thick) and made in the pattern which will be used. There are a handful of standard kupesi designs, like the 'pine road' (the road from the palace to the royal cemetery), or the 'shield of Tonga', or the 'lion' (the king), or the 'dove' (the king as ruler), and more abstract figures like the 'Manulua' (two birds). A Tongan woman accentuating the kupesi design The tapa sheet is put over the drum and the women rub with force a dabber with some brown paint (made from the koka tree (Bischofia javanica)) over the sheet. This work is called tatai. Where they rub over a rib of the kupesi more paint will stick to that position while very little will stick elsewhere. In this way the basic pattern is put on the sheet. Once a part is done, they lift up the sheet and proceed to the next strip and so forth. Only when the whole sheet has been preprocessed, it will be spread out on the ground and with a brush (made from Pandanus seeds). The women will accentuate the faintly visible marks with some more generous paint, this time made from the tongo, the mangrove (Rhizophora mangle). Both koka and tongo paint are always brown, but the latter is much darker. Black is not used in Tonga, although it is characteristic for Fiji. It is customary that during the paint process lines are drawn on the ngatu along the width every 45 cm or more. The kupesi too are made to the size that they will fit in the divisions thus made. Such a division is known as langanga and they are numbered (on the blank tapa) from one to as many as needed for the whole length. When a smaller piece of ngatu is needed, the sheet is cut along a langanga division. A 4 to 6 langanga piece is called folaosi. An 8-piece is fƒÅtuua, while a 10 langanga piece of ngatu is known as toka hongofulu. Less common are the double fƒÅtuua, named fƒÅtufƒÅ or double of that again, the fƒÅtuvalu. These are the traditional ngatu, as evidenced by the extensive vocabulary used (still many more terms exist). Nowadays for the tourist trade other sizes and designs can be made as well.

Macomb was the field commander at the Battle of Plattsburgh during the War of 1812 and, after the stunning victory, was lauded with praise and styled \\"The Hero of Plattsburgh\\" by some of the American press. He was promoted to Major General for his conduct, receiving both the Thanks of Congress and a Congressional Gold Medal. Early life Born at British-held Detroit in 1782, Macomb was the son of Alexander Macomb, a merchant and fur trader from upstate New York, and Mary Catherine Navarre, she of ethnic French descent.Geo. H. Richards, Memoir of Alexander Macomb (NY: M'Elrath, Bangs & Co., 1833), 14. and at Internet archive. He moved with his parents to New York City, where his father gained wealth as a land speculator, particularly in the millions of acres of New York land released by the federal government for sale after the Iroquois nations had been largely forced from the state into exile in Ontario following British defeat in the American Revolutionary War. The son received a classical education at Newark Academy in New Jersey. Early career In 1798, at the age of 16, Macomb joined a New York militia company. In January 1799, with the recommendation of Alexander Hamilton, he was commissioned a Cornet in the Regular Army during the French emergency. In March he was promoted to second lieutenant, and he was honorably discharged in June 1800. In February 1801, he was commissioned a second lieutenant, 2d Infantry, serving as secretary to a commission that treated with the Indians of the Southeast. He was commissioned a first lieutenant in the Army Corps of Engineers, which was established in 1802 at West Point to constitute a military academy. He was one of the first officers to receive formal training there. For five years, Macomb directed construction of coastal fortifications in the Carolinas and Georgia. He also established fortifications at Fort Gratiot, Michigan, Chicago, Mackinaw, Prairie du Chien, St. Peter's, and St. Mary's in what was considered the Northwest area - Michigan and Illinois.Jenkins, John S. (1856) \\"Alexander Macomb\\". In Daring Deeds of American Generals, (New York: A. A. Kelley, Publisher) At the beginning of the War of 1812, in July 1812 Macomb was promoted at the age of 30 to colonel of the newly organised 3rd Artillery Regiment. He was in command of the Sacketts Harbor garrison. Under Winfield Scott, he took part in the Capture of Fort George. He was part of James Wilkinson's failed St. Lawrence expedition. Command at the Battle of Plattsburgh He won acclaim during the War of 1812 as brigadier general in command of the Right Division of the Northern Army, responsible for defending the frontier of northern New York. At the Battle of Plattsburgh on September 11, 1814, with only 1,500 regular troops and some detachments of militia, he was opposed by a British force of 10,531 men under Lieutenant General Sir George Prevost. Macomb's heavily outnumbered troops fell back before the British columns in a series of encounters as Prevost advanced towards the American defensive works. In the weeks leading up to the battle, Macomb, knowing full well he would be greatly outnumbered, worked with his men to move trees and create fake roads; in order to obscure the genuine roads and lead the British into dead-end traps far from the three nearby American forts (a maneuver Macomb called abattis).General Macomb's report to the Secretary of War Sept 15, 1814 The British attack was diffused by these efforts. The long narrow lines of marching soldiers were unable to easily stop and about-face. They became entangled in the narrow false road maze, where they became targets for American ambush. The British were about to launch an assault on the American defenses when the news came through of the defeat of the British naval squadron on Lake Champlain. Prevost needed the British Lake Champlain squadron to supply his planned advance into Vermont. Without it, he had no choice but to abandon the expedition. The British invaders returned to Canada. Macomb was showered with praise and styled \\"the Hero of Plattsburgh\\" by some in the American press. He was promoted to major general for his conduct at this battle, and received the formal thanks of Congress and a Congressional Gold Medal. Commanding General of the United States Army When Major General Jacob Brown, the Army's commanding general, died in February 1828, Macomb was the senior brigadier general on the Army register, although, as the Army's chief of engineers, he was paid only at the rank of a colonel. President John Quincy Adams promoted him to commanding general of the Army with the rank of major general. The Army's two serving brigadier generals -- Winfield Scott and Edmund P. Gaines -- had been vying for the position. Their quarrels over seniority had scandalized the Army and Adams bypassed them to offer the post to Macomb. The general's last active service in a theater of war was in the Seminole War in Florida, in 1835.Brown, John Howard, The Cyclopaedia of American Biography: Comprising the Men and Women of the United States Who Have Been Identified with the Growth of the Nation V5 (Published by Kessinger Publishing, 2006) 700 pages, Alexander Macomb, p. 305. , , Macomb's tenure as Commanding General was marked by \\"continuing uncertainty about the responsibilities and authority of his position. To secure his seniority over Scott and Gaines, both two-star brevet major generals, Macomb added a provision in the 1834 regulations that 'the insignia of the major general commanding in chief should be three stars.' In the same document he sought to define his relationship to the Secretary of War and establish his primacy over the bureau chiefs, including his successor as Chief of Engineers. This was easier said than done. Most issues were not fully resolved until early the next century.\\" He advocated doubling Army strength, increasing enlisted pay, providing relief for some widows and orphans, and regularizing the officer retirement and replacement system. In 1840 the Army Corps of Engineers adopted the castle uniform insignia and first described the Corps of Engineers' distinctive Essayons button (Motto in French, meaning: \\"Let us try\\"). Macomb was succeeded by Major General Winfield Scott, who had worked \\"hard at mending fences in the intervening 13 years...\\" within the Army. Writings and other works In 1809, Macomb was the author of a seminal book (republished in 2006) on martial law and the conduct of courts-martial. It was the first book written on American procedures. During this period he was serving as a judge- advocate general (JAG) in the Army. He published a revised, updated book solely on courts martial in 1809. Republished: He also wrote a play on the siege of Detroit by Ottawa chief Pontiac. It features Macomb's maternal grandfather, Robert Navarre, who helped defend the settlement. See Published Works and Further Reading, infra. In addition, Macomb is recognized as an artist. His painting Detroit as Seen from the Canadian Shore in 1821, a watercolor and pencil work, is held by the Detroit Institute of Arts.Gibson, Arthur Hopkins.

Engineers as commanding generals Macomb was the first of five Commanding Generals (Chiefs of Staff after the 1903 reorganization) who had held Engineer commissions early in their careers. All had transferred to other branches before being appointed to this top position. The others were George B. McClellan, Henry W. Halleck, Douglas MacArthur, and Maxwell D. Taylor.

Historical recognition Alexander Macomb is recognized by a Michigan Historical Marker installed at the corner of Gratiot Avenue and Macomb Street in Mount Clemens, Michigan, the county seat of Macomb County, named for him. It is Registered Site S0418, erected in 1974. It states: He is memorialized by several statues. One was sculpted by Adolph Alexander Weinman and erected in 1906 in downtown Detroit, Michigan. This statue was made from melted down cannons, and was a notable and monumental task. Another is in downtown Mount Clemens, Michigan, in front of the Circuit Court building at 40 N. Gratiot Avenue. Several others exist. Macomb died while in office at Washington, D.C. He was originally buried at the Presbyterian Burying Ground, but in 1850 his remains were disinterred and he was reburied at Congressional Cemetery. His remains, and those of his wife, Catherine, were disinterred again in June 2008 so that the brick-lined burial vault beneath their 6-ton, 13-foot-tall marble monument could be repaired to prevent its impending collapse. During the month it took to make the necessary repairs, the couple's remains were held at the Smithsonian; they were viewed by several of the general's descendants, including his great-great-great granddaughter. After the $24,000 repairs were completed by the Department of Veterans Affairs, their remains were re-interred on July 17, 2008. The monument to Alexander Macomb is \\"one of the most unusual in the nation.\\" =Societies= During the 1820s, Macomb was a member of the Columbian Institute for the Promotion of Arts and Sciences, who counted among their members former presidents Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams and many prominent men of the day, including well-known representatives of the military, government service, medical and other professions.

After her death in September 1920 he married secondly Olga Marie Grumler, daughter of Jeanes Georges Grumler, in 1921. Both marriages were childless. Lord Alness died in October 1955, aged 87, when the barony became extinct.

The fort underwent massive restoration efforts and reopened in 2012. However, the complex lacks in visitor information. There are no exhibits or brochures available to learn more about this large space or guides at hand to provide further details so people either need to go on a tour or explore on their own. History of Bahla Fort Bahla Fort The fort is believed to have been built between the 12th and 15th century by the Banu Nebhan tribe who inhabited the area at the time and were known for controlling the trade of frankincense at the time. As part of the complex, there is also a citadel oasis adjacent to the fort and an ancient wall spanning 13 kilometres part of which are still standing. The majority of the oasis is in ruins but the structure and some of the houses still stand. As the fort was built with bricks made of mud and straw, erosion damaged the structure until rehabilitation efforts were launched. There are a lot of legends surrounding the castle.  Structure of Bahla Fort  There are three main parts inside the fort. The oldest part of the fort is Al-Qasabah. Bait al-Hadith, or new house, was built by the Ya‚Äôriba dynasty (1624-1743). Bait Al-Jabal was erected in the 18th century.  Risks to the Fort  * The unfired brick is likely to decay * Drainage is bad * Modern materials are used on the rebuilding of the souk  Previous restorations  Preservation attempt in 1995 was found to be a renovation not a restoration because the aim of the remodeling was to make the fort look new. This renovation began without prior archaeological, topographic, architectural or technical surveys. Original building was mud-brick and mortar and plaster. Restoration unjustifiably used stone and cement to cover the walls so severely that the original walls couldnt e seen at all Irrigation is an issue, as there have not been any recent efforts to conserve this system. Parts of the ancient wall surrounding the fort have been destroyed or altered because of nearby building construction.

Raised in Germany, Hoffnung was brought to London as a boy, to escape the Nazis. Over the next two decades in England, he became known as a cartoonist, tuba player, impresario, broadcaster and raconteur. After training at two art colleges, Hoffnung taught for a few years, and then turned to drawing, on the staff of English and American publications, and later as a freelance. He published a series of cartoons on musical themes, and illustrated the works of novelists and poets. In 1956 Hoffnung mounted the first of his \\"Hoffnung Festivals\\" in London, at which classical music was spoofed for comic effect, with contributions from many eminent musicians. As a broadcaster he appeared on BBC panel games, where he honed the material for one of his best-known performances, his speech at the Oxford Union in 1958. Early years Born in Berlin, and named Gerhard, Hoffnung was the only child of Jewish parents, Hildegard and Ludwig Hoffnung.Ingrams, Richard. \\"Hoffnung, Gerard (1925‚Äì1959)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004.

Gerard went with his mother to London, where she rented a house in Hampstead Garden Suburb, where Hoffnung lived for the rest of his life. In 1939 he enrolled at Highgate School, where, according to one biographer, he was \\"remembered for his anarchic spirit\\". Among the artists he most admired when he was growing up was Walter Trier, long associated with Lilliput magazine.\\"Mr Gerard Hoffnung ‚Äì Artist and Musician\\", The Times, 29 September 1959, p. 17 Hoffnung had his first cartoon published in the same publication while he was still at school. After leaving Highgate, Hoffnung studied at Hornsey College of Art, but was expelled for his lack of gravity in the life class. He then attended Harrow School of Art,Spiegl, Fritz, \\"Hoffnung, Gerard\\", Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online, Oxford University Press.

Retrieved 17 March 2013 He was a staff artist to Cowles Magazines Inc in New York in 1950, and otherwise pursued a career as a freelance cartoonist. He contributed to Punch, The Strand Magazine and The Tatler, and to other British, continental, and American magazines. He also produced advertising work for Kia-Ora, Guinness, and other companies. He presented one-man exhibitions of his work, including one at the Little Gallery, Piccadilly (1949), and two at the Royal Festival Hall (1951 and 1956). Musical drawings In the words of his biographer Richard Ingrams, Hoffnung > developed a distinctive style which owed something to the German illustrator > Wilhelm Busch. He mainly drew with a mapping pen and Indian ink, and also > used watercolours and wax crayons. His illustrations in colour for Colette's > libretto for Ravel's opera L'enfant et les sortil√®ges were outstanding. Much of Hoffnung's humour centred on the world of music, particularly the various instruments of the orchestra with which he was fascinated. He published a series of books of cartoons poking gentle fun at conductors and orchestral instrumentalists. Examples include the drawing of a musician being devoured by the serpent he is trying to play;Hoffnung, unnumbered page in \\"The Hoffnung Symphony Orchestra\\" section another shows a singer whose waistcoat buttons are control knobs labelled On/off, ppp/fff, Wobble, and Sobs.Hoffnung, unnumbered page in \\"The Hoffnung Music Festival\\" section He depicted Malcolm Sargent as \\"Elegantemente\\", conducting with a full-length mirror at the front of his rostrum. After Hoffnung's death, some of the cartoons were turned into short animated films by Halas and Batchelor with music by Francis Chagrin in the television series Tales from Hoffnung (1965). Broadcasts and concerts In 1950 Hoffnung began a career as a broadcaster for the BBC, as both raconteur and regular contestant in panel games including One Minute Please, the predecessor of Just a Minute. He was, in the words of Ingrams, \\"a brilliant improviser with a dry wit and a masterly sense of timing\\". Probably the best-known example of Hoffnung as a humorous speaker is an account of a bricklayer's misfortunes when raising some bricks in a barrel to the top of a building. It was part of a speech to the Oxford Union on 4 December 1958. The derivation of the story is confused, but it first arises in the 1930s. It was published in Reader's Digest in 1940 as a letter from a naval officer who had supposedly received it from an enlisted man explaining his late return from leave. Hoffnung first saw the story in The Manchester Guardian in 1957;\\"Miscellany ‚Äì Stoic\\", The Manchester Guardian, 11 June 1957, p. 5 the version printed there is identical with the text used by Hoffnung, except for the location, which he changed from Barbados to Golders Green. Hoffnung used the piece to warm up the audience before each recording session of One Minute, Please. In these performances he perfected the timing before the Oxford Union speech. The story was part of his speech in a debate called Life Begins at 38 and was recorded by the BBC. The tale itself was not, Ingrams comments, especially funny, but \\"[Hoffnung's] manner and delivery reduced his audience to hysterics\\". Among Hoffnung's other well-known subjects were his supposedly helpful advice to tourists in London (\\"Have you tried the famous echo in the Reading Room of the British Museum?\\") and allegedly genuine letters in fallible English from continental hoteliers (\\"There is a French widow in every bedroom affording delightful prospects\\").Hoffnung at the Oxford Union. Decca DFE 8682 (1968) In 1956 Hoffnung took part in one of the popular \\"April Fool's\\" concerts in Liverpool, organised by Fritz Spiegl.

In addition to his public persona as an eccentric and wit, Hoffnung had a deeply serious and moral side. He joined the Quakers in 1955 and was active in their prisoner visiting scheme. According to a biographical sketch by Joel Marks, first published in Essays in Arts and Sciences (University of New Haven, Volume XXI, 10/1992), \\"Hoffnung's outlook on race relations, homosexuality, nuclear disarmament, the treatment of animals (especially hunting) and, for that matter, the music of Bart√≥k and Schoenberg [was] liberal and impassioned.\\" A week before he died he took part in a show at the Festival Hall in aid of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, along with Peggy Ashcroft, Benjamin Britten, C.

Prior to this appointment in 2017, Halberstam was a Professor of American Studies and Ethnicity, Gender Studies, and Comparative Literature and the Director of The Center for Feminist Research at University of Southern California (USC). Halberstam was the Associate Professor in the Department of Literature at the University of California at San Diego before working at USC. Halberstam is a gender and queer theorist and author. Focusing on the topic of tomboys and female masculinity for his writings, his 1998 Female Masculinity book discusses a common by-product of gender binarism, termed \\"the bathroom problem\\" with outlining the dangerous and awkward dilemma of a perceived gender deviant's justification of presence in a gender-policed zone, such as a public bathroom, and the identity implications of \\"passing\\" therein. Assigned female at birth, he accepts masculine and feminine pronouns, and the name \\"Judith\\" in addition to \\"Jack\\", for himself. Halberstam lectures in the United States and internationally on queer failure, sex and media, subcultures, visual culture, gender variance, popular film and animation. Halberstam is currently working on several projects including a book on fascism and (homo)sexuality. Early life, education and gender identity  Halberstam earned a B.A. in English at the University of California, Berkeley in 1985, an M.A. from the University of Minnesota in 1989, and a Ph.D. from the same school in 1991. Halberstam is Jewishhttps://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/twice-blessed-jewish-and-gay- in-the-21st-century/ of Bohemian descent.http://www.jackhalberstam.com/ Assigned female at birth, Halberstam goes by the pronouns he/his and the name \\"Jack\\", but says that he is \\"loosey goosey\\" and a \\"free floater\\" when it comes to his gender. He says \\"some people call me Jack, my sister calls me Jude, people I've known forever call me Judith\\" and \\"I try not to police any of it. A lot of people call me he, some people call me she, and I let it be a weird mix of things.\\" He says that \\"the back and forth between he and she sort of captures the form that my gender takes nowadays\\" and that the floating gender pronouns have captured his refusal to resolve his gender ambiguity. He does, however, say that \\"grouping me with someone else who seems to have a female embodiment and then calling us 'ladies', is never, ever ok!\\" Career =Female Masculinity= In Female Masculinity (1998), Halberstam seeks to identify what constitutes masculinity in society and within the individual. The text first suggests that masculinity is a construction that promotes particular brands of male-ness while at the same time subordinating \\"alternative masculinities\\". The project specifically focuses on the ways female masculinity has been traditionally ignored in academia and society at large. To illustrate a cultural mechanism of subordinating alternative masculinities, Halberstam brings up James Bond and GoldenEye as an example, noting that gender performance in this film is far from what is traditional: M is the character who \\"most convincingly performs masculinity\\", Bond can only perform masculinity through his suave clothing and gadgets, and Q can be read \\"as a perfect model of the interpenetration of queer and dominant regimes\\". This interpretation of these characters challenges long-held ideas about what qualities create masculinity.Halberstam, Judith (1998). Female masculinity. Duke University Press. . Halberstam also brings up the example of the tomboy, a clear case of a youthful girl exerting masculine qualities‚Äîand raises the complication that within a youthful figure, the idea of masculinity expressed within a female body is less threatening, and only becomes threatening when those masculine tendencies are still apparent as the child progresses in age. Jack Halberstam lecturing on Trans* Bodies at the CCCB (Centre de Cultura Contempor√†nia de Barcelona), on February the 1st 2017 Halberstam then focuses on \\"the bathroom problem\\". Here, the question of the gender binary is brought up. Halberstam argues that the problem of only having two separate bathrooms for different genders, with no place for people who do not clearly fit into either category to use, is a problem. The assertion is further made that our bathroom system is not adequate for the different genders found in society. The problem of policing that occurs around the bathrooms is also a focal point for examination of the bathroom problem; not only is this a policing on the legal level, but also on the social level. The social aspect of policing, according to Halberstam, makes it even more difficult for people who do not clearly and visibly fall into one category or another to use public restrooms without encountering some sort of violent or uncomfortable situation. =The Queer Art of Failure= In The Queer Art of Failure, Halberstam argues that failure can be productive, a way of critiquing capitalism and heteronormativity. Using examples from popular culture, like Pixar animated films, Halberstam explores alternatives to individualism and conformity. L. Ayu Saraswati calls The Queer Art of Failure \\"a groundbreaking book that retheorizes failure and its relationship to the process of knowledge production and being in the world.\\" Introduction: Low Theory In his introduction, Halberstam proposes low theory as a way to deconstruct the normative modes of thought that have established uniform societal definitions of success and failure. Low theory is a term that Halberstam borrows from cultural theorist Stuart Hall, using it to undermine heteronormative definitions of success and to argue that failure to live up to societal standards can open up more creative ways of thinking and being in the world. Halberstam points out that queer and feminine success is always measured by male, heterosexual standards. The failure to live up to these standards, Halberstam argues, can offer unexpected pleasures such as freedom of expression and sexuality. Halberstam clarifies his points encouraging failure in a lecture called \\"On Behalf of Failure\\": \\"My basic point with failure is that in a world where success is countered in relationship to profit ... or relayed through heteronormative marriage, failure is not a bad place to start for a critique of both capitalism and heteronormativity.\\" Halberstam describes low theory as a \\"utility of getting lost over finding our way\\". In reference to societal norms and definitions of success, Halberstam asks the reader how to avoid those forms of knowing and being that relegate other forms of knowing to redundancy and irrelevancy. Halberstam provides several examples of publications, films and popular cultural artifacts in order to aid in explaining the concept of low theory. These include SpongeBob SquarePants, Monsters, Inc., Little Miss Sunshine, and the writings of Monique Wittig and Barbara Ehrenreich among others. Chapter One: Animating Revolt and Revolting Animation In the first chapter of his book Jack Halberstam focuses on certain animated films and how they inherently teach children about revolt. He then relates this sort of revolt into her idea about Queer Theory. He opens the chapter by simply stating how animated films \\"revel in the domain of failure\\". He states how it isn't enough for an animated film to focuses on success and triumph because that it not what happens in childhood. He explains how childhood is \\"growing sideways,\\" as stated by Kathryn Bond Stockton in her work The Queer Child or Growing Sideways in the Twentieth Century. Halberstam goes on to speak about how Stockton has shown that childhood is queer in nature but society trains children to be heterosexual, by our parents placing emphasis and guiding their kids toward marriage and heterosexual reproduction. Simply put heterosexuality is made, not born. Halberstam explains that revolt and rebellion are inherent in children, and if these traits weren't, then society would have no reason to train them. He then makes the transition back to animated films, saying how they address the disorderly child who sees the large world beyond his controlling family. These animated films get to the root of the struggle between human and non-human creatures. He gives these animated films a name, calling them \\"Pixarvolt\\" films. Pixar, referring to the company that created the first-ever computer-animated feature film. Pixarvolts have themes that would never be seen in adult films, according to Halberstam. These films also make subtle and obvious connections between communist revolt and queer embodiment. Halberstam argues that although Marxist scholars have dismissed queer theory as 'body politics', these films do a great job of showing \\"that alternative forms of embodiment and desire are central to the struggle against corporate domination\\" (Halberstam 29). He begins talking about Toy Story (1995), the first movie Pixar created. What made Toy Story such a success was its ability to engage children with the fantasy world of talking, living toys and also capture the nostalgia of older generations by employing the cowboy main character, Woody. He argues that the narratives of the film, past and present, adult and child, live and mechanic, show all the possibilities that this new animation world has created. Toy Story set the themes that are involved in all Pixarvolt film. These films are interested in social hierarchies, the outside world versus the imaginary world, and these films are all powered by revolution, transformation and rebellion. Most Pixarvolt films deal with escape to a utopian freedom. One such film about an escape to utopia is Chicken Run (2000). These chickens escape using a natural solution combined with an engineering solution, which is using all the chicken's flying abilities to power one large plane so they can escape. The queer element of this film is that most all these chickens are female so the utopia is full of free green pastures of chickens with only a few roosters around. \\"The revolution in this instance is feminist and animated\\" (Halberstam 32). Halberstam then speaks of how humans project our worlds onto animals. He explains the term of human exceptionalism, which he defines in two ways: Humans thinking they are more superior, and unique to other animals and Humans using cruel forms of anthropomorphism. He most speaks about anthropomorphism, which is the attribution of human characteristics to an animal. He speaks of a New York Times \\"Modern Love\\" article in which the author begins training her husband with the same techniques she saw the trainer in Sea World using on Shamu the killer whale. Halberstam first knocks how committed this shows humans are to failing structures, like marriage, that we think we ourselves are failing and must try different things. He then goes on to explain how drawing on animal behavior makes humans feel heterosexuality is more natural or primal. She imposes her boring domestic lifestyle on the life of this exotic animal, which is anthropomorphism, just to maintain her flawed sense of natural heterosexuality. Halberstam moves on to talk about the successful documentary, March of the Penguins (2005). Like other animal documentaries, this humanizes animal life and reduces animals to human ways of life. He explains how this film perpetuates heterosexuality in a false way. The film leaves out key facts about penguins journey to find love and have a baby. The first fact it leaves out is that penguins are not monogamous; they mate for one year and move on. They also leave their babies after they know they are able to swim in the water. The baby penguins then gain five years of their lives on their own, before starting another mating cycle. Halberstam claims, \\"the long march of the penguins is proof neither of heterosexuality in nature nor of the reproductive imperative nor of intelligent design\\" (Halberstam 41). Lastly Halberstam talks about monstrous animations and their direct connection to the queer way of thinking. Animation started to create these odd human-like figures that were not human, but not animal either. Halberstam goes on to reference the movie Monsters, Inc. (2001). In this movie the corporate world relies on screams of little children to power themselves. When one monster goes to scare a little girl, and she is not scared, it scares him partially. Halberstam relates this to allowing the child to stand up to its 'boogeyman'-type figure, but at the same time form an affectionate relationship with the figure. This bond is queer in that it lets the child control the transgression of its own boundaries. It interrupts the more conventional romantic bond with a bond that seems odd and misplaced. He ends the first chapter by giving the differences on Pixarvolt films versus regular animated films. The main difference is that regular animated films stress family, human individuality and extraordinary individuals. Pixarvolt films focus more on collectivity, social bonding and diverse communities. Halberstam explains that, \\"Two thematics can transform a potential Pixarvolt film into a tame and conventional cartoon: an overemphasis on nuclear family and a normative investment in coupled romance\\" (Halberstam 47). He lastly says how Pixarvolt films show the importance in recognizing weirdness of bodies, sexuality and gender, but do it through other animal worlds. Chapter Two: Dude, Where's My Phallus? In the second chapter of Judith Halberstam's The Queer Art of Failure, Halberstram highlights things such as stupidity, forgetfulness, and how they have impacted views on Queer culture. The second chapter really illuminates how stupidity is viewed differently upon men and women, and how it can sometimes even be a gateway for the queer culture. He highlights certain movies scenes and novels where stupidity and forgetfulness couple together to actually opens the door for certain groups of individuals such as the LGBT community. Jack Halberstam lecturing on the topic \\"Trans* Bodies\\", with Miquel Miss√© S√°nchez sitting on the right, at CCCB (Centre de Cultura Contempor√†nia de Barcelona), February the 1st 2017 Halberstam begins to define stupidity on page 54 where she says \\"Stupidity conventionally means different things in relation to different subject positions; for example, stupidity in white men can signify new modes of domination, but stupidity in women of all ethnicities inevitably symbolizes their status as, in psychoanalytic terms, \\"castrated\\" or impaired.\\" Stupidity can mean a variety of things depending on the scenario. Right off the bat he gives an example of how stupidity in men is generalized compared to that of women. Stupidity in women seems to be strictly looked down upon, while stupidity in men can be seen as charming. Women have always been oppressed by the idea, which was created by past hierarchy systems, that women are just not as intelligent as men.. \\"Stupidity is as profoundly gendered as knowledge formations in general; thus while unknowing in a man is sometimes rendered as part of masculine charm, unknowing in a woman indicates a lack and a justification of a social order that anyway privileges men. Though we both punish and naturalize female stupidity, we not only forgive stupidity in white men, but we often cannot recognize it as such since white maleness is the identity construct most often associated with mastery, wisdom, and grand narratives.\\"Halberstam, Judith. The Queer Art of Failure. Durham: Duke UP, 2011. N. pag. Print. White males were the symbolization of knowledge and power, not stupidity. The election of 2004, between George W. Bush and John Kerry, was used as an example of how stupidity is beneficial in certain scenarios for men. John Kerry was the well-educated, hard-working, and well-spoken candidate who gets edged out by George W. Bush, a man who sold himself on being a fun-loving, fun to be around type of guy. Bush sold himself to the public in a way to show that he was just an average person like \\"everyone else\\". Society loved that he was a Yale student but not a 4.0 kind of student. Stupidity in men does not hurt their chances in society, unlike that of women. In a male-dominated culture, stupidity in men does not have a negative downside. In this case, it actually helped the person. Stupidity can also help shed light on queer culture also. Halberstam goes on to talk about the movie, Dude, Where's My Car? and how the film used the stupidity and forgetfulness of the main characters, Jesse and Chester, to show that in given situations that would normally be uncomfortable for heterosexual white males, is not uncomfortable at all. The stupidity of Chester and Jesse in Dude, Where's My Car? led to many homosexual and transsexual references throughout the film. Halberstam says that by interjecting this idea of forgetting into Jesse and Chester's characters causes a certain queer phenomenon throughout the film. Jesse willingly knew that he was receiving a lap dance from a transsexual, but forgets the social norms that would typically go along with that. Most white heterosexual men would not willingly accept a lap dance from a transsexual, but Jesse is too stupid to realize what is taking place. His stupidity takes sexual orientation out of the equation because he doesn't think about the fact that it's a transsexual giving him the lap dance. Although Massachusetts was the first state to legalize gay marriage in 2004, Dude, Where's My Car? was released in 2000.Avery, Alison, et al. \\"America's changing attitudes toward homosexuality, civil unions, and same-gender marriage: 1977‚Äì2004.\\" Social Work 52.1 (2007): 71-79.). The film brought light to the gay community using stupidity and forgetfulness as a staple. In 2000, gay acceptance was not nearly what it is today, thus making Dude, Where's My Car? somewhat controversial. It was not until 2015 that same-sex marriage had become legal in all 50 states.Traurig, Greenburg. \\"Supreme Court Rules Same-Sex Marriage Is a Fundamental Right.\\" LexisNexis Academic [LexisNexis]. N.p., 15 July 2015. Web. 28 Sept. 2016. Even though it is legal in all 50 states, some states such as Mississippi tried to pass a law that protects those who object to same-sex marriage, but was blocked.Law360, and John Kennedy. \\"5th Circ. Won't Unblock Law Shielding Gay Marriage Objectors.\\" LexisNexis Academic [LexisNexis]. N.p., 15 Aug 2016. Web. 27 Sept. 2016. The queer culture was brought to light in this film when Jesse and Chester share their convincing kiss at the end in their car next to a heterosexual couple. The stupidity of Jesse and Chester was the gateway into the kiss. Halberstam says that forgetting is one of the best ways for the queer group to break through. To forget about the past, forget family traditions and start new without having to conform to old societal norms. He goes on to explain that forgetting family as the standard mother and husband is essential to create a gateway for the queer community. We must forget these societal norms in order to make way for equality. Forgetfulness in the case of Dory in the film Finding Nemo brings about a queer version of selfhood. Since Dory's memory is so bad, it causes her to live in the present and forget about the past essentially. Dory cannot remember her past, causing her to forget and live in the moment. Forgetting is a way to keep the disturbing memories of the past, in the past. Forgetting opens up the doors for new things while suppressing the awful memories. Halberstam notes the importance of forgetfulness in the queer community and how positive that can be. Forgetting in this way can help one handle the stress of being oppressed for being part of a community such as the LGBT which is and has been discriminated against. Forgetting simply makes it easier for those to move on and accept a new beginning. Chapter Six: Animating Failure: Ending, Fleeing, Surviving In Chapter 6 of The Queer Art of Failure, Judith Halberstam focuses more on the specific works of queer theory scholars, and examines works such as \\"Kung Fu Panda\\" and \\"Disney\\", to push her points forward. The sixth chapter truly encompasses the way animation is a \\"... rich, technological field for rethinking collectives, transformation identity, animality and post humanity.\\" A few of the large and popular examples she uses to prove her point and argue those of queer theory scholars are comparison of \\"George W. Bush\\" to the \\"Kung Fu Panda\\", Disney films and cartoons as a form of revolt, and the depth of form in Pixar films, such as Finding Nemo, Monsters, Inc. and A Bug's Life. In the chapter \\"Animating Failure: Ending, Fleeing, Surviving\\", Halberstam starts off by criticizing the view of Slavoj Zizek on Kung Fu Panda. Zizek compares the panda to George W. Bush, explaining that just like Bush, the panda rose to success because of the system, and that it was inherently tipped in his favor. Halberstam states that Kung Fu Panda \\"... joins new forms of animation to new conceptions of the human-animal divide to offer a very different political landscape than the one we inhabit, or at least the one Zizek imagines ...\\" In addition to Kung Fu Panda, Halberstam goes in-depth on the complexity of animation, specifically in A Bug's Life, where a new form of \\"crowd scenes\\" were introduced. Once the technique behind the animation of the \\"crowd\\" is available, you then must make it believable by adding the proper story line. For example, in the film Fight Club, there is a scene of the brain created with much complexity, using L-systems, and is not as much an image of the brain or of cells as it is \\"an animation of the theory of cellular life\\". The first step to animation is the technique, a \\"... heady mix of science, math, biology ...\\" However, without the narrative, it will not be effective, and the inner complexity of the image is what propels it forward to accurately represent what it is attempting to. Stop-motion animation is the last point Halberstam touches on in this chapter. She goes into examples of \\"SpongeBob SquarePants\\", \\"Mr. Fox\\", \\"Chicken Run\\" and \\"Coraline\\" explaining how ideas of racism, entrapment, masculinity and political progression are present heavily in stop-motion films. Themes of remote control and imprisonment are also heavily present in stop-motion animation. The use of stop-motion animation can help evoke different emotions as well. For example, in Chicken Run, the start- stop jerkiness allows the narrative to be even more humorous. Themes of remote control and imprisonment are also heavily present in stop-motion animation. However, we must remember that \\"... the comedic soul of Chicken Run is not its operatic escape ... it's about the viewer's personal relationship with his or her inner chicken.\\" =\\"Telling Tales: Brandon Teena, Billy Tipton, and Transgender Biography\\"= \\"Telling Tales\\" is an essay concerned with the politics of \\"passing\\" as well as the ethics of transgender biography. The essay discusses how women who \\"pass\\" are often accused of being deceptive, and they are subjected to brutal violations which often terminate their lives. Halberstam poses questions about who controls narratives that circulate about the lives of transgender people. The paper discusses \\"transgender biography as a sometimes violent, often imprecise project, one which seeks to brutally erase the carefully managed details of the life of a passing person and which recasts the act of passing as deception, dishonesty and fraud\\" (Halberstam 14). The essay also provides a brief transgender history that is accompanied by a definition of terms such as female masculinity, transsexual, realness, the 'real', female-to-male transsexuals (FTM), butch, and femme. The author thinks that trans bodies have a certain illegibility, and he is suspicious of \\"experts\\" who try to read, document, and pin down \\"lives filled with contradiction and tension\\" (Halberstam 20). =Gaga Feminism= In Gaga Feminism Halberstam uses Lady Gaga as a symbol for a new era of sexual and gender expression in the 21st century. The book has been noted as \\"a work that engages in the theorizing of contemporary gender relations and their cultural narratives, and the practice of calling for a chaotic upending of normative categories in an act of sociopolitical anarchy.\\" Halberstam describes five tenets of Gaga feminism: > *Wisdom lies in the unexpected and the unanticipated. *Transformation is > inevitable, but don't look for the evidence of change in the everyday; look > around, look on the peripheries, the margins, and there you will see its > impact. *Think counterintuitively, act accordingly. *Practice creative non- > believing. *Gaga Feminism is outrageous ... impolite, abrupt, abrasive and > bold.Halberstam, Judith (2005). Gaga Feminism. Boston: Beacon Press, 2012. Halberstam uses contemporary pop culture examples such as SpongeBob SquarePants, Bridesmaids, and Dory from Finding Nemo to explore these tenets. =Other works= In a Queer Time and Place: Transgender Bodies, Subcultural Lives, published in 2005, looks at queer subculture, and proposes a conception of time and space independent of the influence of normative heterosexual/familial lifestyle. Halberstam coedits the book series \\"Perverse Modernities\\" with Lisa Lowe. Trans*: A Quick and Quirky Account of Gender Variability, published in 2018, examines recent developments in the meanings of gender and gendered bodies. Through dissecting gendered language and creations of popular culture, Halberstam presents a complex view of the trans* body and its place in the modern world. Personal life Halberstam is one of six children, including Naomi, Lucy, Michael, Jean and John. Halberstam's father, Heini Halberstam, and mother, Heather Peacock, were married until Heather's death in a car accident in 1971. Heini Halberstam married Doreen Bramley shortly thereafter, and they had a marriage of 42 years until Heini's death on January 25, 2014 in Champaign, Illinois at the age of 87. Halberstam is openly attracted to women. After a relationship of 12 years, Halberstam has been romantically involved with Macarena Gomez-Barris, a sociology professor from Los Angeles, since 2008. Halberstam has said that he feels no pressure to marry, viewing marriage as a patriarchal institution that should not be a prerequisite for obtaining health care and deeming children \\"legitimate\\". Halberstam believes that \\"the couple form is failing\\". Honors and awards Halberstam has been nominated three times for Lambda Literary Awards, twice for the non-fiction book Female Masculinity.

Examples of credentials include academic diplomas, academic degrees, certifications, security clearances, identification documents, badges, passwords, user names, keys, powers of attorney, and so on. Sometimes publications, such as scientific papers or books, may be viewed as similar to credentials by some people, especially if the publication was peer reviewed or made in a well- known journal or reputable publisher. Types and documentation of credentials A person holding a credential is usually given documentation or secret knowledge (e.g., a password or key) as proof of the credential. Sometimes this proof (or a copy of it) is held by a third, trusted party. While in some cases a credential may be as simple as a paper membership card, in other cases, such as diplomas, it involves the presentation of letters directly from the issuer of the credential its faith in the person representing them in a negotiation or meeting. Counterfeiting of credentials is a constant and serious problem, irrespective of the type of credential. A great deal of effort goes into finding methods to reduce or prevent counterfeiting. In general, the greater the perceived value of the credential, the greater the problem with counterfeiting and the greater the lengths to which the issuer of the credential must go to prevent fraud. =Diplomacy= In diplomacy, credentials, also known as a letter of credence, are documents that ambassadors, diplomatic ministers, plenipotentiary, and charg√©s d'affaires provide to the government to which they are accredited, for the purpose, chiefly, of communicating to the latter the envoy's diplomatic rank. It also contains a request that full credence be accorded to his official statements. Until his credentials have been presented and found in proper order, an envoy receives no official recognition. The credentials of an ambassador or minister plenipotentiary are signed by the head of state, those of a charg√© d'affaires by the foreign minister. Diplomatic credentials are granted and withdrawn at the pleasure of the issuing authority, based on widely varying criteria. A receiving government may reject a diplomat‚Äôs credentials by declining to receive them, but in practice this rarely happens. =Medicine= In medicine, the process of credentialing is a detailed review of all permissions granted a medical doctor, physician assistant or nurse practitioner at every institution at which he or she has worked in the past, to determine a risk profile for them at a new institution. It vets the practitioner for both receiving practice insurance and the ability to bill to insurance for patient care. As well, it certifies legal and administrative body requirements, such as the Joint Commission. Medical practitioners must also have credentials in the form of licenses issued by the government of the jurisdictions in which they practice, which they obtain after suitable education, training, and/or practical experience. Most medical credentials are granted for a practice specific group. They may also be withdrawn in the event of fraud or malpractice by their holders. Typically they require continuing education validation and renewal to continue practice. =Information technology= Information systems commonly use credentials to control access to information or other resources. The classic combination of a user's account number or name and a secret password is a widely used example of IT credentials. An increasing number of information systems use other forms of documentation of credentials, such as biometrics (fingerprints, voice recognition, retinal scans), X.509, public key certificates, and so on. =Operator licensing= Operators of vehicles such as automobiles, boats, and aircraft must have credentials in the form of government-issued licenses in many jurisdictions. Often the documentation of the license consists of a simple card or certificate that the operator keeps on his person while operating the vehicle, backed up by an archival record of the license at some central location. Licenses are granted to operators after a period of successful training and/or examination. This type of credential often requires certification of good health and may also require psychological evaluations and screening for substance abuse. Operator licenses often expire periodically and must be renewed at intervals. Renewal may simply be a formality, or it may require a new round of examinations and training. =Cryptography= Credentials in cryptography establish the identity of a party to communication. Usually they take the form of machine-readable cryptographic keys and/or passwords. Cryptographic credentials may be self-issued, or issued by a trusted third party; in many cases the only criterion for issuance is unambiguous association of the credential with a specific, real individual or other entity. Cryptographic credentials are often designed to expire after a certain period, although this is not mandatory. An x.509 certificate is an example of a cryptographic credential. =Security clearances= In military and government organizations, and some private organizations, a system of compartmenting information exists to prevent the uncontrolled dissemination of information considered to be sensitive or confidential. Persons with a legitimate need to have access to such information are issued security clearances, which can be tracked and verified to ensure that no unauthorized persons gain access to protected information. Security clearances are among the most carefully guarded credentials. Often they are granted to individuals only after a lengthy investigation and only after their need to have access to protected information has been adequately justified to the issuing authority. The most elaborate security-clearance systems are found in the world's military organizations. Some credentials of this type are considered so sensitive that their holders are not even permitted to acknowledge that they have them (except to authorized parties). Documentation of security clearances usually consists of records keep at a secure facility and verifiable on demand from authorized parties. Breaches of security involving security clearances are often punished by specific statutory law, particularly if they occur in the context of deliberate espionage, whereas most other counterfeiting and misuse of credentials is punished by law only when used with deliberate intent to defraud in specific contexts. Security clearances are regularly withdrawn when they are no longer justified, or when the person holding them is determined to be too great a security risk. =Journalism= In many democratic nations, press credentials are not required at the national or federal level for any publication of any kind. However, individual corporations, and certain government or military entities require press credentials, such as a press pass, as a formal invitation to members of the press which grants them rights to photographs or videos, press conferences, or interviews. Press credentials indicate that a person has been verified as working for a known publication, and holding a press pass typically allows that person special treatment or access rights. Some governments impose restrictions on who may work as a journalist, requiring anyone working for the press to carry government-issued credentials. Restricting press credentials can be problematic because of its limitations on freedom of the press, particularly if government leaders selectively grant, withhold, or withdraw press credentials to disallow critique of government policy. Any press coverage published under governments that restrict journalism in this way is often treated with skepticism by others, and may not be considered any more truthful or informative than propaganda. =Trade credentials= Some trades and professions in some jurisdictions require special credentials of anyone practicing the trade or profession. These credentials may or may not be associated with specific competencies or skills. In some cases, they exist mainly to control the number of people who are allowed to exercise a trade or profession, in order to control salaries and wages. Persons acting as merchants, freelancers, etc., may require special credentials in some jurisdictions as well. Here again, the purpose is mainly to control the number of people working in this way, and sometimes also to track them for tax- reporting or other purposes like people evaluation. =Academic and professional credentials= The academic and professional world makes very extensive use of credentials, such as diplomas, degrees, certificates, and certifications, in order to attest to the completion of specific training or education programs by students, to attest to their successful completion of tests and exams, and to provide independent validation of an individual's possession of the knowledge, skills, and ability necessary to practice a particular occupation competently. (For example: Arun Paul MSW, MPHIL) Documentation of academic and professional credentials usually consists of a printed, formal document. The issuing institution often maintains a record of the credential as well. Academic credentials are normally valid for the lifetime of the person to whom they are issued. Professional certifications are normally valid for a limited number of years, based on the pace of change in the certified profession, and require periodic recertification through reexamination (to demonstrate continuing competency as occupational standards of practice evolve) or continuing professional development (to demonstrate continually enhanced competency). Acquisition of these credentials often leads to increased economic mobility and work opportunity, especially for low-income people. A general term for academic credentials in the form of a resume is Curriculum Vitae, abbreviated as CV. =Titles= Titles are credentials that identify a person as belonging to a specific group, such as nobility or aristocracy, or a specific command grade in the military, or in other largely symbolic ways. They may or may not be associated with specific authority, and they do not usually attest to any specific competence or skill (although they may be associated with other credentials that do). A partial list of such titles includes *personal titles, such as Lord, Knight, Right Honourable, indicating an earned or inherited rank or position within a formal power structure; *command ranks, such as Captain, Sergeant, etc., indicating likewise a very specific position in a command hierarchy, e.g. police rank or military rank; *an academic degree or professional designation such as PhD, EurIng, P.Eng or M.D., whether this be purely honorary or symbolic, or associated with credentials attesting to specific competence, learning, or skills; *labor union and club memberships; *persons allowed access to specific areas during special events, such as concerts and shows; *citizenship, as in the case of passports and birth certificates.

But after taking first-class honours in mathematical moderations (preliminary examinations) in 1891, he studied Greats (ancient history and philosophy) taking first-class honours in 1894. He also played tennis for Oxford against Cambridge. On leaving Oxford he spent a brief period working for a firm of solicitors in London, before returning to Oxford where he spent the rest of his life, first as Fellow of Hertford College (1895‚Äì98) and then of Trinity College (1898‚Äì1924). He took early retirement from Trinity in 1924 on grounds of ill health, but recovered and was elected White's Professor of Moral Philosophy in 1928 and became a fellow of Corpus Christi College. He retired in 1937. Philosophical work Prichard gave an influential defence of ethical intuitionism in his \\"Does Moral Philosophy Rest on a Mistake?\\" (1912), wherein he contended that moral philosophy rested chiefly on the desire to provide arguments, starting from non-normative premises, for the principles of obligation that we pre-philosophically accept, such as the principle that one ought to keep one's promises or that one ought not steal. This is a mistake, he argued, both because it is impossible to derive any statement about what one ought to do from statements not concerning obligation (even statements about what is good), and because there is no need to do so since common sense principles of moral obligation are self-evident. The essay laid a groundwork for ethical intuitionism and provided inspiration for some of the most influential moral philosophers, such as John Rawls. =Criticism of Utilitarianism= Prichard attacks Utilitarianism as not being capable of forming obligation. He states that one cannot justify an obligation by pointing to the consequences of the obligated action because pointing to the consequences only shows that the action is desirable or advisable, not that it is obligatory. In other words, he claims that, while Utilitarianism may encourage people to do actions which a moral person would do, it cannot create a moral obligation to do those actions. =Deriving moral obligation= H. A. Prichard is an ethical intuitionist, meaning he believed that it is through our moral intuitions that we come to know right and wrong. Further, while he believes that moral obligations are justified by reasons, he does not believe that the reasons are external to the obligation itself. For instance, if a person is asked why he ought not torture chipmunks, the only satisfying answer that could be given is that he ought not torture chipmunks. Prichard, along with other intuitionists, adopts a foundationalist approach to morality. Foundationalism is a theory of epistemology which states that there are certain fundamental principles which are the basis for all other knowledge. In the case of ethics, foundationalists hold that certain fundamental moral rules are their own justification. Walter Sinnott-Armstrong explains: > The deepest challenge in moral epistemology, as in general epistemology, is > raised by a skeptical regress argument: Someone is justified in believing > something only if the believer has a reason that is expressible in an > inference with premises that the believer is already justified in believing. > This requires a chain of inferences that must continue infinitely, close > into a circle, or stop arbitrarily. Academic skeptics reject all three > options and conclude that there is no way for anyone to be justified in > believing anything. The same regress arises for moral beliefs . . . The > simplest way to stop this regress is simply to stop. If a believer can work > back to a premise that the believer is justified in believing without being > able to infer that premise from anything else, then there is no new premise > to justify, so the regress goes no further. That is how foundationalists > stop the regress in general epistemology. Moral intuitionists apply > foundationalism to moral beliefs as a way to stop the skeptical regress > regarding moral beliefs. Therefore, Prichard concludes that just as observation of other people necessitates that other people exist, the observation of a moral obligation necessitates that the obligation exists. Prichard finishes his essay by answering a few obvious problems. Most notably, he explains how people should guarantee the accuracy of their moral intuitions. Clearly, observations can be misleading. For instance, if someone sees a pencil in water, he may conclude that the object in the water is bent. However, when he pulls the pencil from the water, he sees that it is straight. The same can occur with moral intuition. If one begins to doubt one's intuition, one should try to imagine oneself in the moral dilemma related to the decision. If the intuition persists, then the intuition is accurate. Prichard further supports these claims by pointing out how it is illegitimate to doubt previously believed moral intuitions: > With these considerations in mind, consider the parallel which, as it seems > to me, is presented though with certain differences by Moral Philosophy. The > sense that we ought to do certain things arises in our unreflective > consciousness, being an activity of moral thinking occasioned by the various > situations in which we find ourselves. At this stage our attitude to these > obligations is one of unquestioning confidence. But inevitably the > appreciation of the degree to which the execution of these obligations is > contrary to our interest raises the doubt whether after all these > obligations are, really obligatory, i.e., whether our sense that we ought > not to do certain things is not illusion. We then want to have it proved to > us that we ought to do so, i.e., to be convinced of this by a process which, > as an argument, is different in kind from our original and unreflective > appreciation of it. This demand IS, as I have argued, illegitimate. Hence in > the first place, if, as is almost universally the case, by Moral Philosophy > is meant the knowledge which would satisfy this demand, there is no such > knowledge, and all attempts to attain it are doomed to failure because they > rest on a mistake, the mistake of supposing the possibility of proving what > can only be apprehended directly by an act of moral thinking.

Artificial Intelligence. Entry points to the game embedded into the film's promotion centered on the fictional Jeanine Salla and the death of her friend Evan Chan. In 2142, Jeanine learns that Evan was murdered and her investigation uncovers a network of murders of humans and artificial intelligences. The game launched on March 8, 2001 and continued running past its initially scheduled end date on June 29, the film's release date.Duggan, E. (2017) \\"Squaring the (Magic) Circle: A Brief Definition and History of Pervasive Games\\". In Nijholt, A. ed. Playable Cities: The City as a Digital Playground. Springer. Singapore. pp. 111‚Äì135. Players were led through a network of websites created by Warner Bros., registered to fake names, and further clues were given in subsequent promotional materials and events for the film. The game drew a large, tight-knit player base who created online groups dedicated to the game, most prominently the Yahoo! Group Cloudmakers. The Beast was described as \\"unprecedented even by Hollywood standards\\" and is considered among the most influential early alternate reality games.  Game  The Beast centers around the fictional Jeanine Salla, who investigates the death of her friend Evan Chan and discovers a cover-up involving a string of murdered humans and artificial intelligences. Players were led through a network of over forty websites created by Warner Bros. via clues left in trailers, print ads, posters, telephone messages, and live promotional events for the film A.I. Artificial Intelligence. The game launched on March 8, 2001 and continued running past its initially scheduled end on June 29, the release date for the film. = Premise = Set in 2142, roughly forty years after A.I. Artificial Intelligence, Evan Chan is said to be killed in a boating accident aboard his artificial intelligence-enhanced boat Cloudmaker. Dr. Jeanine Salla receives a cryptic message revealing he was murdered and leads an investigation. She discovers that he was having an affair with Venus, a companion bot reprogramed to kill Evan, and that the ensuing cover-up triggers further murders of humans and artificial intelligences. Simultaneously, the Mann Act is brought before the legislature and the president and ultimately put to referendum to decide if artificial intelligence will be treated equal to human citizens. = Plot development = Clues to the game were distributed through trailers, print ads, posters, telephone messages, and live promotional events for the film A.I. Artificial Intelligence and even in graffiti in public restrooms in major cities throughout the United States. Online, the game was presented through numerous websites in text, photograph, video, and audio based formats. Players entered the game through one of three entry points, called \\"rabbit holes\\" by the development team, centering on Dr. Jeanine Salla: trailers and posters credited Jeanine Salla as the production's \\"sentient machine therapist\\", a phone number hidden in another trailer ultimately led to Jeanine, and a promotional poster sent to technology and entertainment media outlets had a code stating, \\"Evan Chan was murdered. Jeanine is the key.\\" The Beast was launched on March 8, 2001; however, only roughly one hundred players discovered the game in the first few weeks. Harry Knowles brought broad attention to The Beast with an Ain't It Cool News article about Jeanine and the websites referencing her. In April, Harry Knowles of Ain't It Cool News received an email from someone calling himself \\"claviusbase,\\" a reference to 2001: A Space Odyssey, urging he search the internet for Jeanine Salla. He obliged and discovered numerous websites registered to the same IP address, including one for a Bangalore World University, founded in 2028 and claiming to be Jeanine's employer. He posted an article about the websites to the Ain't It Cool News website on April 11, drawing 25 million hits to The Beast websites that day and over 22,000 messages about The Beast to Ain't It Cool News over two months. CNN stated that Knowles' article was believed to be the first written about the game. In May, during a presentation of A.I Artificial Intelligence at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, producer Kathleen Kennedy and actor Haley Joel Osment accepted a question from a presumedly planted audience member about their experience working with Jeanine Salla, and Kennedy afterward distributed business cards for Jeanine containing another game clue. Later that month, \\"Anti-Robot Militia\\" rallies in New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles were staged with actors pretending to protest artificial intelligence. Jeanine Salla and other characters of The Beast are listed in the film's closing credits. = Cloudmakers and player base = Cloudmakers, named after the boat on which Evan was murdered, is a Yahoo! Group and website dedicated to the game. The Cloudmakers website was described to be among the first dedicated to the game. Though the total number of players was uncertain, the Cloudmakers group was said to include a majority of the player base. Before the film's release 4,500 to nearly 5,000 users were registered to the group's message board. The founder of the website stated in June 2001 that the discussion list generated tens of thousands of messages weekly. The game was being developed as it was played. While most players came to the plotlines after they had been solidified, the Cloudmakers group was constantly on the cutting edge of the game, pushing the game's developers and influencing the plot. Warnings and messages sent by Cloudmakers members to characters in the story regularly turned up in the plot, and designs/blueprints and databases produced by the group were referenced by and even featured on in-game websites and magazines (as were the efforts of a smaller group, SphereWatch). After the game, the Puppetmasters admitted that they relied on the vast storehouse of knowledge amongst the Cloudmakers and other player groups to be able to meet any puzzle the designers created. For instance, a puzzle near the end of The Beast required that the players understand lute tablature, and sure enough there were Cloudmakers who could solve it.  Creation and production  Though The Beast does not directly reference A.I Artificial Intelligence, the film's producer Kathleen Kennedy stated that the game's intention was develop the film's fictional setting and create a foundation for a series of video games released over five years as part of a \\"very elaborate long term project with Microsoft and Xbox\\". The project was estimated to cost over $1 million to produce. Jordan Weisman created the original concept, and it was further designed and developed by Elan Lee. Science fiction writer Sean Stewart was brought to the project as head writer. The game was originally scheduled to end with the release of the film on June 29, 2001, but it continued running throughout the summer. Ultimately, fifty websites with a total of about one thousand pages were created for the game. To prevent a connection between the websites and A.I. Artificial Intelligence promotion, the websites were registered to various individuals with the surname Ghaepetto, a reference to Geppetto, and under fake phone numbers and addresses. The game's creators later became known as the \\"Puppetmasters\\".. Kevin McLeod was one of the Puppetmasters. He was assisted by Thuc Doan Nguyen on sites like Cybertronics, Eliza's Tea Room and others. Microsoft also initially denied involvement in the game's development, though this was believed to be part of maintaining the integrity of the game's intrigue. Pete Fenlon served as content lead. The name The Beast was actually the design team's internal appellation which remained undisclosed until the Puppetmasters the game's end; at the time players referred to this endeavor as the A.I. webgame or, simply, The Game. The narrative visual content fell to director/dp Tarquin Cardona and producers Rudy Callegari and Bob Fagan.  Reception and legacy  The game was described by the Los Angeles Times as \\"one of the most elaborate movie promotions ever conceived\\" that is \\"unprecedented even by Hollywood standards\\". The Atlantic cites it as the \\"first truly successful alternate reality game\\", and Polygon stated it was the first of its kind. The Beast was compared to The Blair Witch Project marketing campaign, though Knowles felt The Blair Witch Project campaign was more successful due to the broader appeal of the concept and the longer lifespan of the footage. Knowles believed that the game's popularity placed pressure on director Steven Spielberg and the studio to produce a film innovative enough to match the interest in the game, stating that the production's secretiveness raised expectations. Despite its success, the game failed to draw an audience to A.I Artificial Intelligence, which domestically grossed less than its budget.

It was established on 7 October 1944 by the Polish Committee of National Liberation, effectively replacing the pre-war police force. The Citizen's Militia would remain the predominant means of policing in Poland until 10 May 1990, when it was transformed back into Policja. The term milicja had been adapted from the cognate term, militsiya, used in several communist countries. The term is derived from militia, which in turn claims its etymology from the concept of a military force composed of ordinary citizens. Contrary to implied meaning, in most cases it represented rather a state- controlled force used to exert political repression on the citizens, especially with its elite ZOMO squads. Under both communist and post-communist governments, the Polish police system has traditionally operated under the auspices of national authority. Starting at the end of World War II, Poland fell under the influence of the Soviet Union. In 1948, the country's turn toward Stalinism brought the beginning of totalitarian rule, \\"in which one Party ruled autonomously over all sections of society\\".Kemp-Welch, A. (2008). Poland under Communism: A Cold War History, p. 26. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. . The highly centralized nature of the militia and its lack of any great power placed it largely under the control of the Security Bureau, which used it to instill fear in the local populace. Training for the force was conducted in the town of Legionowo. Organisation European Solidarity Centre An actor dressed in a militiaman's uniform The Citizens' Militia was divided into a Public Order Department, Traffic Militia (Highway patrol), Criminal Investigations (Major crimes, forensics), Investigations Militia and an Infrastructure Security Section (Security of government buildings, airports, installations). There were regional, district, city and local detachments of the force. The ZOMO motorized riot troops, which played the most visible role in quelling demonstrations in 1980 and 1981, were reduced in size somewhat by the early 1990s and renamed Preventive Units of the Citizens' Militia (‚ÄîOPMO). OPMO forces are restricted to roles such as crowd control at sporting events, ensuring safety in natural disasters, and assisting the regular police. In theory, higher government authority would be required for large OPMO contingents to be used.http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi- bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+pl0277%29 From the 1960s through the 1980s, ORMO forces, which at one time numbered as many as 600,000 civilian volunteers, were used to augment regular police personnel at key trouble spots. In the early 1980s, ORMO harassed Solidarity members and prevented independent groups from organizing. Largely staffed by industrial workers who gained substantial privileges by monitoring their peers in the workplace, ORMO was the object of extreme resentment throughout the 1980s. Kiszczak attempted to promote ORMO as a valuable auxiliary police force, but the organization was abolished by the Sejm in 1990.

It is descended from the Chinese sheng, of the Tang Dynasty era, although the sh≈ç tends to be smaller in size than its contemporary sheng relatives. It consists of 17 slender bamboo pipes, each of which is fitted in its base with a metal free reed. Two of the pipes are silent, although research suggests that they were used in some music during the Heian period. The instrument's sound is said to imitate the call of a phoenix, and it is for this reason that the two silent pipes of the sh≈ç are kept‚Äîas an aesthetic element, making two symmetrical \\"wings\\". Similar to the Chinese sheng, the pipes are tuned carefully with a drop of a dense resinous wax preparation containing fine lead shot. As (breath) moisture collected in the sh≈ç's pipes prevents it from sounding, performers can be seen warming the instrument over a small charcoal brazier or electric burner when they are not playing. The instrument produces sound when the player's breath is inhaled or exhaled, allowing long periods of uninterrupted play. The sh≈ç is one of the three primary woodwind instruments used in gagaku, Japan's imperial court music. Its traditional playing technique in gagaku involves the use of tone clusters called aitake (ÂêàÁ´π), which move gradually from one to the other, providing accompaniment to the melody. A larger size of sh≈ç, called u (derived from the Chinese yu), is little used, although some performers, such as Hiromi Yoshida and Ko Ishikawa, began to revive it in the late 20th century. A detailed book in English on the sh≈ç and the gagaku (court orchestra music) it is associated with is titled Music of a Thousand Autumns: The Togaku style of Japanese Court Music by Robert Garfias. In contemporary music Playing sh≈ç The sh≈ç was first used as a solo instrument for contemporary music by the Japanese performer Mayumi Miyata. Miyata and other sh≈ç players who specialize in contemporary music use specially constructed instruments whose silent pipes are replaced by pipes that sound notes unavailable on the more traditional instrument, giving a wider range of pitches. Beginning in the mid-20th century, a number of Japanese composers have created works for the instrument, both solo and in combination with other Japanese and Western instruments. Most prominent among these are Toshi Ichiyanagi, Toru Takemitsu, Takashi Yoshimatsu, Jo Kondo, Maki Ishii, Joji Yuasa, Toshio Hosokawa, and Minoru Miki. The American composer John Cage (1912‚Äì1992) created several Number Pieces for Miyata just before his death, after having met her during the 1990 Darmstadt summer course. Other notable contemporary performers, many of whom also compose for the sh≈ç and other instruments, include Hideaki Bunno (Japan), Tamami Tono (Japan), Hiromi Yoshida (Japan), K≈ç Ishikawa (Japan), Remi Miura (Japan), Naoyuki Manabe (Japan), Alessandra Urso (United States), Randy Raine- Reusch (Canada), and Sarah Peebles (Canada). Peebles has extensively incorporated sh≈ç in improvised, composed and electroacoustic contexts, including an album of music with photo essay dedicated to the instrument (\\"Delicate Paths‚ÄìMusic for Sh≈ç\\", Unsounds 2014). Other notable 20th-century composers who also studied the instrument in Japan include Benjamin Britten and Alan Hovhaness, the latter of whom composed two works for the instrument. German avant-garde composer Helmut Lachenmann used the sh≈ç at the climax of his opera, Das M√§dchen mit den Schwefelh√∂lzern. Otomo Yoshihide, a Japanese experimental improv musician, incorporates the sh≈ç in some of his music. The instrument was introduced to a wider audience by the German musician Stephan Micus (in his albums Implosions, Life, and Ocean) and the Icelandic singer- songwriter Bj√∂rk, who used it as the primary instrument in three songs performed by Miyata for the soundtrack album to Drawing Restraint 9, a film by her former boyfriend Matthew Barney, about Japanese culture and whaling. Composer Vache Sharafyan (1966, Armenia) used sh≈ç in his composition \\"My Lofty Moon\\" scored for five eastern and eight western instruments that was premiered by the Atlas Ensemble in Amsterdam's Muziekgebouw aan 't IJ in 2007. It was played on the ISS by Koichi Wakata. See also *Sheng (instrument) *Saenghwang  Notes   Further reading  * *F. T.

Its name is a play on the word amphora. The cup was originally designed by Leslie Buck of the Sherri Cup Co. in 1963, to appeal to Greek-owned coffee shops in New York City, and was later much copied by other companies. The original Anthora depicts an image of an Ancient Greek amphora, a Greek key design on the top and bottom rim, and the words \\"WE ARE HAPPY TO SERVE YOU\\" in an angular typeface resembling ancient Greek, for example with an E resembling a capital sigma (\\"Œ£\\", a letter pronounced like English \\"s\\"). The blue and white colors were inspired by the flag of Greece. The cup subsequently became the metropolitan area's definitive coffee-to-go cup. Sales of the cup reached 500 million in 1994 (when it was by far the most popular design for the company's cups), but had fallen to about 200 million cups annually by 2005. One New York Times writer in 1995 called the Anthora \\"perhaps the most successful cup in history\\". By 2007 it was mentioned in passing in a New York Times television review as \\"one of those endangered artifacts\\". The trademark was acquired by the Solo Cup Company, which licenses sales of the cup. The Anthora coffee cup is featured in movies and television shows that are set in New York such as Goodfellas, The Sopranos, Nurse Jackie, Archer, Brooklyn 99, NYPD Blue, Suits, Friends, Men in Black, How I Met Your Mother, Succession, the Law & Order franchise, Marvel's Daredevil, and Flight of the Conchords. Buck never made royalties from his design, but as a salesman he was well-remunerated for the success of the product. When he retired from Sherri Cup Co. in 1992, he was presented with 10,000 Anthoras printed with a testimonial inscription. After Buck's death in 2010, a New York Times writer described the motto on the cup as having \\"welcome intimations of tenderness, succor and humility\\".

In the late 1930s the German Army built a large base and training ground at which the XIX Army Corps of General Heinz Guderian was based.  Camp history In September 1939 two Stalags, Stalag 302 and Stalag 323 were established to house Polish prisoners from the German September 1939 offensive. The Polish POWs were transferred to other camps on 1 June 1940 and Oflag II-D was established to house French officers from the Battle of France. By February 1941 there were 3,166 officers and 565 orderlies in the camp. In 1942 some of the French officers may have been transferred to other camps and replaced with Polish officers. In 1942 a large camp (Stalag 323) was built for Soviet prisoners. It was located at the other end of the training ground. Conditions in this camp were deplorable, as the rules of the Third Geneva Convention were not observed for Soviet prisoners. In October 1944 most of the officers from the Warsaw Uprising were brought to this camp. The roster of 1 January 1945 showed that there were 5,014 officers and 377 orderlies in the camp. In November 1944 the officers created a bank which printed banknotes.  Evacuation and repatriation  When the offensive of the Soviet Red Army resumed in 1945, all inmates were marched westward on 28 January 1945. Only those too sick to walk were left behind. After an eight-week march in bitterly cold weather they reached Stalag X-B and Marlag und Milag Nord in Sandbostel. The prisoners were liberated there by units of the British Army on 5 May 1945.

Playing career Hrabosky played both baseball and football at Savanna High School in Anaheim, California and was originally drafted by the Minnesota Twins in the 11th round of the 1967 amateur draft, but did not sign with the club. Two years later the Cardinals made him their first round choice. Within a year, at the age of 20, he made his major league debut, pitching a scoreless inning against the San Diego Padres. During his time with the Cardinals, Hrabosky became a fan favorite for his antics on the mound. When entering a game, he would turn his back to the batter, walk towards second base, vigorously rub the ball between his palms several times, take a deep breath, and pound the ball into his mitt. He would then storm back to the mound, staring down the batter. Although the crowd would roar in delight, most batters were not fond of the pitcher's routine. Arguably, Hrabosky's best year was 1975 when he led the National League in saves with 22 (a career best) en route to winning the Sporting News \\"NL Fireman of the Year\\" award. He also finished the season with a career high in wins posting a 13-3 record with an ERA of just 1.67. After eight seasons in St. Louis, the Cardinals traded Hrabosky to the Kansas City Royals in a swap of closers for Mark Littell. Following just two years with the Royals, he was released and signed with the Atlanta Braves. Early in his career with the Cardinals, Hrabosky enhanced his menacing appearance with long hair, and a horseshoe moustache. When Vern Rapp became Cardinals manager and imposed a grooming code on the players in 1977, Hrabosky cut his hair and shave the moustache despite his vehement opposition. He explained, \\"Relief pitching is 75 per cent mental. How am I going to scare hell out of the hitters with my new image? How am I going to convince them I'm a dangerous madman if I look like a golf-pro? I've never been blessed with great ability. My mystique was what made me successful.\\"Boswell, Thomas. \\"Opposing Batters Stop Needling Mad Hungarian,\\" The Washington Post, Wednesday, March 23, 1977. Retrieved September 8, 2020 The enmity between Hrabosky and Rapp persisted throughout the season and included the former being suspended on May 21 for what Cardinals management stated as \\"rank insubordination.\\"\\"Hrabosky Is Suspended,\\" The Associated Press, Saturday, May 21, 1977. Retrieved September 8, 2020 Perhaps Hrabosky's most memorable performance came during an ABC Monday Night Baseball game on May 9, 1977, against the Cincinnati Reds. In the top of the ninth with the game tied at 5‚Äì5, Hrabosky allowed the first three hitters (all left-handed), Ken Griffey, Joe Morgan, and Dan Driessen to reach base and load the bases. As the Redbirds home crowd roared, Hrabosky went into his \\"Mad Hungarian\\" routine described above and proceeded to strike out right-handed power hitters George Foster, Johnny Bench, and Bob Bailey. The Cardinals went on to win 6‚Äì5 on a Ted Simmons home run in the 10th inning. On December 8, 1977, he was traded to the Kansas City Royals for Mark Littell and Buck Martinez. The following year, he went 8‚Äì7 for the Royals while having a 2.88 ERA with 20 saves in 75 innings of work and 58 games pitched. He had 60 strikeouts and 35 walks while allowing fewer hits and runs than the year before. He appeared in three games of the ALCS that year, his first and only time pitching in the postseason. He appeared in the eighth inning of Games 1, 2, and 3, allowing a combined total of three hits and one run, although the Royals lost in four games. The following year, he went 9‚Äì4 with a 3.74 ERA while having 11 saves in 65 innings. He allowed more hits and runs (67 and 31, respectively) while having 39 strikeouts and 10 walks. He was granted free agency after the season, and he subsequently signed with the Atlanta Braves. During his time with the Braves he saw diminished playing time and recorded just seven saves over three seasons. Hrabosky's last appearance in the majors was on August 18, 1982 at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium against the Montreal Expos. He pitched the final two innings of a blowout, allowing four runs on four hits with a strikeout and two home runs (hit by Andre Dawson and Tim Wallach) allowed in a 12‚Äì2 loss. Twelve days later, he was released by the Braves. Hrabosky signed with the Chicago White Sox during Spring training in 1983 but retired before the season began. In 13 seasons he recorded 64 wins, 35 losses, and 97 saves with an ERA of 3.10. Broadcasting career left Following his playing career, he has provided color commentary for Cardinals games since 1985 and has been with Fox Sports Midwest since 1997. Hrabosky also hosted his own radio show on KFNS 590AM in St. Louis. He also serves as an occasional fill-in analyst on the Cardinals Radio Network.

Originally created for Superman: The Animated Series, the character appeared in March 1997 in Superman Adventures #5 (based on the animated series). Her first mainstream comic book appearance was in Action Comics #835 (March 2006). In television, the character was voiced by Lori Petty in Superman: The Animated Series and Maria Canals in Justice League. In live-action Superman-based television series, she has been portrayed by Anna Mae Routledge in Smallville and Brit Morgan in Supergirl. Fictional character biography =DC Animated Universe= Leslie Willis was once a popular and controversial Metropolis radio shock jock. No one was immune to her venomous words, not even Superman. She took cynical joy in attacking him during her broadcasts. Among her audience, Lex Luthor enjoyed listening to her. One evening during a severe thunderstorm Willis was hosting a rock concert in honor of her third anniversary working at the radio station in Centennial Park in downtown Metropolis. Ignoring her producer's warnings about the storms, the public safety concerns of Metropolis authorities, and the changeable skies, Willis demanded the show go on. Livewire, in Superman: The Animated Series. It was at about that time Superman showed up to help the police break up the event. Willis' fans showed support for her by throwing stuff at the Man of Steel, when suddenly, lightning struck the stage, setting it on fire. Superman pushed Willis to safety as a second bolt of lightning electrified the metal tower on the stage; the electricity ran through Superman's body and into a wire on stage which Willis then stepped on, shocking Willis and changing her appearance. When Willis woke up, she saw that her skin had turned ghostly white and her hair turned blue and stood on end. She watched Superman talking to reporters on live TV about the accident: one reporter insinuated that Superman, fed up with Willis's hateful comments, may have pushed her into harm's way to punish her, which he denies of course. Willis angrily blames Superman for the transformation caused by the accident and was about to throw a clock-radio at the TV when the radio suddenly turned on in her hands without being plugged in. She discovered she has the power to control electricity. Willis then escaped from the hospital by turning herself into an electric current. Confronting Superman, she had rearranged the electrons of the hospital gown she was wearing into a black leotard with a lightning bolt down the front and black boots. She then declared herself to be Livewire now, and took over telephones, televisions, radios, effectively controlling all of the local media. However, she had to drain electricity to continue her takeover and Superman chased her to a hydroelectric plant and stopped her when he doused her with water. Again hospitalized, Luthor generously pays Willis' hospital bills due to their shared contempt for Superman. She had a short-lived alliance with Parasite and later had an alliance with Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy. Lori Petty voiced Livewire in Superman: The Animated Series and The New Batman Adventures. An uncredited Maria Canals voiced Livewire in Justice League. Her powers and appearance have striking similarities to the controversial Superman Blue, although predating the arc by three years. In an episode of the Justice League animated series, Livewire teamed up with the Superman Revenge Squad to get revenge on Superman. When some of its members were defeated and Toyman's machine sent Superman into the future with them thinking that Superman is dead, Kalibak and Livewire later attacked the scene of the incident with Copperhead, Volcana, Star Sapphire, and Deadshot. When it came to Season 3 of Justice League Unlimited, Livewire later returned as a member of Gorilla Grodd's Secret Society. Superman Adventures In the Superman Adventures comics, based on the DCAU animated series, Livewire makes an appearance in issue #5, \\"Balance of Power\\", the two-part \\"War Games\\" (#22‚Äì23) and in the two-part finale (#65‚Äì66), \\"Power Play\\", the latter also featuring Lex Luthor and Darkseid. She is portrayed more sympathetically in the comics, teaming up with Professor Hamilton and putting all of her energy into stopping Brainiac in \\"War Games\\", which puts her into a coma until she awakens in \\"Power Play\\", where she officially reforms. =Comics= In Action Comics #835, Gail Simone and John Byrne brought Livewire into the mainstream DC Universe, in the same tradition as Harley Quinn. Much like the DCAU version of Livewire, before she gained her abilities, she was also a shock jock. Going by the DJ name Leslie, her show was dedicated to bashing upon Superman every night, claiming that Superman was only saving people in the name of grandstanding and showing off. She also shows a disdain for fellow broadcaster Billy Batson, aka Captain Marvel. Her career as a shock jock was cut short when the owner of the station, Miguel, decided to turn the station into a country station (a reference to popular real-world shock jock, Howard Stern, who lost his first DJ job in a similar fashion). Miguel was also quite pleased that she was fired because his wife was saved by Superman. Unlike the DCAU version of Livewire, she was born with the gift of controlling electricity. Enraged at the loss of her job, she went to the top of the station where she was struck by lightning. Absorbing a large amount of energy from the lightning bolt, her appearance changed to a chalk- white skin with blue hair. With that change, she decided that she would now take her revenge out on Superman. Superman was weakened by his battle with the Queen of Fables in the previous issue and was unable to withstand Livewire's attacks. Now too weak to fight her directly he defeated her by cunning, shorting out her powers. Helping to save the world Livewire gets kidnapped along with most of the other Metahumans on Earth by a being dubbed the 'Auctioneer'.Action Comics #842 (October 2006) This being scours the universe looking for unique items to acquire (often by theft) before selling them to the highest bidder. Livewire's unique powers allow her, Superman and several other captives to escape their containment fields. She teams up with Nightwing, Superman, the Veteran, Blue Jay and other heroes in fleeing their situation and gaining intelligence. A dampening field provides a psychological barrier against utilizing their powers. With the help of Mister Terrific, who communicates through Livewire's natural electricity, the field is soon neutralized. During the escape attempt, Livewire accidentally creates a link between the makeshift team and every single television on Earth. This proves hard to shut off. Soon the team confronts the Auctioneer.Action Comics #843 (November 2006) With great difficulty, Livewire gains control over the being's communication systems. Under Superman's suggestions, they threaten to broadcast the Auctioneer's entire database to every alien system possible unless he agrees to release the heroes and leave the Earth alone. He reluctantly does so and returns everyone to Earth. The entire adventure was seen on every Earth TV and due to the Auctioneer selling the dramatic story rights, on many alien planets as well. During this story arc she also shows that she is physically attracted to Nightwing. In Teen Titans #51, Livewire is shown to be under the control of Starro. She recently caused a blackout of Gotham City. However, she is easily defeated by Batgirl VI, who was wearing an insulated Batsuit.Batgirl vol. 2 (Jan 2010) #4 During Brightest Day, Livewire is shown battling Wildcat after being possessed by the Starheart.Justice Society of America (vol. 3) #41 In the Superman: Grounded storyline, Livewire attacks Jimmy Olsen and takes hostages in Las Vegas to get the attention of Superman. Superman then puts a modified version of the suit he had to wear when he was briefly converted into an energy being on Livewire (who promptly changes the S-shield on it to an L-shield), which returns her power levels to normal. She is arrested, but does not receive a hard sentence as she only damaged property, no one was wounded, and Superman spoke on her behalf. Iron Munro also chooses to use his influence in the justice department to help. When asked by Jimmy why he would help Livewire, Superman says that, in America, everyone deserves a second chance.Superman #711 With the help of Iron Munro and Serling Roquette, an employee of S.T.A.R. Labs, Livewire is declared reformed. She and Munro are given signal watches as part of an ad hoc 'Supermen of America' group that Superman recruits because he comes to understand he cannot be everywhere at once.\\"Superman\\" #714 (October 2011) The New 52 In the new continuity, Livewire appears as a member of the Secret Society of Super Villains after the events of Forever Evil.Justice League #30 She has previously faced against Superman, who found himself unable to defeat her, since she is made of pure energy, and teamed up with Batman in order to do so.Batgirl #41 Her origin is later given in an issue of Batgirl, where it is revealed that Leslie Willis was once a popular vlogger known for her pranks and makeup tutorials. During a stunt where she tried to reroute all the power in the city in order to spell out a dirty message that would be visible from space, she was accidentally electrocuted, granting her superhuman abilities.Batgirl (vol. 4) #42 Powers and abilities Livewire is a being of pure electricity, able to absorb vast quantities of electricity from external sources and transform her entire body into living electricity (her skintight costume is made up of ionized air). She can manipulate electricity (along with electric and magnetic fields) and generate lightning blasts of various intensities. Her lightning blasts are powerful enough to weaken or stun Superman. She can transform her body into an electric arc in order to travel through anything that will conduct an electric current, possess/control electronic devices such as computers and telecommunications networks, and even control the entire electrical grid. In the comics (as stated by Superman in Action Comics #843) Livewire has the ability to broadcast the energy she has stored in the form of a coherent signal (radio wave, etc.), without directing the energy at a target. Livewire's main weakness is water. Even a small amount of water will cause her stored energy to go haywire. However, if she has enough power, she can survive being splashed without completely losing her powers and suffering only a minor drain. Livewire has to be drenched in water to be fully drained of her energy. She also has another weakness, silicon dust. When she is coated in a large quantity of the dust, its electrical resistance properties render her powerless.Batman: The Animated Series episode \\"Girls' Night Out\\" When drained of her electricity, she reverts to her solid form and cannot use most of her abilities or transform into living electricity until absorbing at least a minimal amount of electric power from some source. However, even when depowered, she can direct the flow of free electricity from an exposed energy source to re-power herself. In the episode \\"Livewire\\" of Superman: The Animated Series, when she wanted to recharge her powers at a hydroelectric plant, Livewire displayed extraordinary strength by lifting one of the power units that stored electricity that she could drain.

Supergirl finally defeats her by dousing her with water from an underground water pipe, shorting her out. She is then imprisoned at the DEO‚Äîthe first transhuman (later coined as metahuman) to be incarcerated there, since this world does not yet have the means to counter them. She made a second appearance in The Flash/Supergirl crossover as one of the main villains alongside another former CatCo employee, Silver Banshee (Siobhan Smythe). In it, Silver Banshee breaks Livewire out of the DEO so they can go after Cat Grant, Supergirl and Kara Danvers (not realizing Kara and Supergirl are one and the same person).

Once covered in deciduous forest, this ecoregion has been degraded through agriculture and the extraction of timber so that it currently has a scanty covering of thorny scrub dominated by such trees as Acacia senegal, Acacia leucophloea and Prosopis cineraria. Where the soils are particularly saline, there are patches of semi-desert. A number of mammals are found in this habitat and about four hundred species of bird. Some small areas are protected but the collection of firewood and the conversion of the land to subsistence farming continues. Location and description The ecoregion encircles the Thar Desert and Indus Valley Desert ecoregions. It stretches along the border lowlands and hills between India and Pakistan and includes: the western half of Gujarat (excluding the mountain of Girnar), and extending through Rajasthan, where it is bounded on the southeast by the Aravalli Range; most of Haryana and Punjab states of India as well as the Jammu region of Jammu and Kashmir, extending to the foothills of the Himalayas; in Pakistan, most of Punjab province, extending into easternmost Northwest Frontier and Baluchistan provinces and western Sindh. This ecoregion, together with the Thar Desert and Indus Valley Desert ecoregions, form Miklos Udvardy's \\"Thar Desert\\" Biogeographic province. Flora The Northwestern thorn scrub forests are thought to be tropical dry forests that have been degraded through intensive agriculture and grazing into stunted and open thorn scrub, dominated by trees such as Acacia senegal and Acacia leucophloea, as well as Prosopis cineraria, Capparis zeylanica, and species of Salvadora, Gymnosporia, Grewia, and Gardenia. However the region also contains patches of semi-desert where the soil is particularly saline.Champion, H. G., and S. K. Seth. 1968. A revised survey of the forest types of India.

New Delhi, India: Oxford & IBH Publishing Company Fauna Despite the large scale forest clearance large mammals still remain in the ecoregion including leopard and their prey such as chinkara (Gazella bennettii) and the threatened species chousingha (Tetracerus quadricornis), and blackbuck (Antilope cervicapra). The scrubland is also home to another large cat, the caracal, which preys on mice, birds, and reptiles. There are two endemic mammals, both bats: Triaenops persicus and the small mouse-tailed bat (Rhinopoma muscatellum) . There are more than 400 species of birds in the region including the endemic rufous-vented grass babbler (Laticilla burnesii), the near-endemic white-winged tit (Parus nuchalis) and the threatened great Indian bustard (Ardeotis nigriceps) and lesser florican (Eupodotis indica). Threats and preservation Over 90% of the ecoregion has been converted to human use, and the remaining habitat is highly fragmented. There are many protected areas but they are very small and unconnected and even these are liable to invasion for firewood collecting and clearance for planting. However the traditions of the Bishnoi community based in this region extend protection to some wildlife, especially the blackbuck and the tree.

Some also include those who have a decreased ability to see because they do not have access to glasses or contact lenses. Visual impairment is often defined as a best corrected visual acuity of worse than either 20/40 or 20/60. The term blindness is used for complete or nearly complete vision loss. Visual impairment may cause difficulties with normal daily activities such as driving, reading, socializing, and walking. The most common causes of visual impairment globally are uncorrected refractive errors (43%), cataracts (33%), and glaucoma (2%). Refractive errors include near- sightedness, far-sightedness, presbyopia, and astigmatism. Cataracts are the most common cause of blindness. Other disorders that may cause visual problems include age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, corneal clouding, childhood blindness, and a number of infections. Visual impairment can also be caused by problems in the brain due to stroke, premature birth, or trauma among others. These cases are known as cortical visual impairment. Screening for vision problems in children may improve future vision and educational achievement. Screening adults without symptoms is of uncertain benefit. Diagnosis is by an eye exam. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 80% of visual impairment is either preventable or curable with treatment. This includes cataracts, the infections river blindness and trachoma, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, uncorrected refractive errors, and some cases of childhood blindness. Many people with significant visual impairment benefit from vision rehabilitation, changes in their environment, and assistive devices. As of 2015 there were 940 million people with some degree of vision loss. 246 million had low vision and 39 million were blind. The majority of people with poor vision are in the developing world and are over the age of 50 years. Rates of visual impairment have decreased since the 1990s. Visual impairments have considerable economic costs both directly due to the cost of treatment and indirectly due to decreased ability to work. Classification A typical Snellen chart that is frequently used for visual acuity testing. The definition of visual impairment is reduced vision not corrected by glasses or contact lenses. The World Health Organization uses the following classifications of visual impairment. When the vision in the better eye with best possible glasses correction is: * 20/30 to 20/60 : is considered mild vision loss, or near-normal vision * 20/70 to 20/160 : is considered moderate visual impairment, or moderate low vision * 20/200 to 20/400 : is considered severe visual impairment, or severe low vision * 20/500 to 20/1,000 : is considered profound visual impairment, or profound low vision * More than 20/1,000 : is considered near-total visual impairment, or near total blindness * No light perception (NLP) : is considered total visual impairment, or total blindness Blindness is defined by the World Health Organization as vision in a person's best eye with best correction of less than 20/500 or a visual field of less than 10 degrees. This definition was set in 1972, and there is ongoing discussion as to whether it should be altered to officially include uncorrected refractive errors. =United Kingdom= Severely sight impaired * Defined as having central visual acuity of less than 3/60 with normal fields of vision, or gross visual field restriction. * Unable to see at what the normally sighted person sees at . Sight impaired * Able to see at , but not at , what the normally sighted person sees at * Less severe visual impairment is not captured by registration data, and its prevalence is difficult to quantify Low vision * A visual acuity of less than 6/18 but greater than 3/60. * Not eligible to drive and may have difficulty recognising faces across a street, watching television, or choosing clean, unstained, co-ordinated clothing.Cupples, M., Hart, P., Johnston, A., & Jackson, A. (2011) Improving healthcare access for people with visual impairment and blindness BMJ (Clinical Research Ed.) In the UK, the Certificate of Vision Impairment (CVI) is used to certify patients as severely sight impaired or sight impaired. The accompanying guidance for clinical staff states: \\"The National Assistance Act 1948 states that a person can be certified as severely sight impaired if they are 'so blind as to be unable to perform any work for which eye sight is essential'\\". Certification is based on whether a person can do any work for which eyesight is essential, not just one particular job (such as their job before becoming blind). In practice, the definition depends on individuals' visual acuity and the extent to which their field of vision is restricted. The Department of Health identifies three groups of people who may be classified as severely visually impaired. #Those below 3/60 (equivalent to 20/400 in US notation) Snellen (most people below 3/60 are severely sight impaired). #Those better than 3/60 but below 6/60 Snellen (people who have a very contracted field of vision only). #Those 6/60 Snellen or above (people in this group who have a contracted field of vision especially if the contraction is in the lower part of the field). The Department of Health also state that a person is more likely to be classified as severely visually impaired if their eyesight has failed recently or if they are an older individual, both groups being perceived as less able to adapt to their vision loss. =United States= In the United States, any person with vision that cannot be corrected to better than 20/200 in the best eye, or who has 20 degrees (diameter) or less of visual field remaining, is considered legally blind or eligible for disability classification and possible inclusion in certain government sponsored programs. In the United States, the terms partially sighted, low vision, legally blind and totally blind are used by schools, colleges, and other educational institutions to describe students with visual impairments. They are defined as follows: *Partially sighted indicates some type of visual problem, with a need of person to receive special education in some cases. *Low vision generally refers to a severe visual impairment, not necessarily limited to distance vision. Low vision applies to all individuals with sight who are unable to read the newspaper at a normal viewing distance, even with the aid of eyeglasses or contact lenses. They use a combination of vision and other senses to learn, although they may require adaptations in lighting or the size of print, and, sometimes, braille. **Myopic ‚Äì unable to see distant objects clearly, commonly called near-sighted or short-sighted. **Hyperopic ‚Äì unable to see close objects clearly, commonly called far-sighted or long- sighted. *Legally blind indicates that a person has less than 20/200 vision in the better eye after best correction (contact lenses or glasses), or a field of vision of less than 20 degrees in the better eye. *Totally blind students learn via braille or other non-visual media. In 1934, the American Medical Association adopted the following definition of blindness: > Central visual acuity of 20/200 or less in the better eye with corrective > glasses or central visual acuity of more than 20/200 if there is a visual > field defect in which the peripheral field is contracted to such an extent > that the widest diameter of the visual field subtends an angular distance no > greater than 20 degrees in the better eye. The United States Congress included this definition as part of the Aid to the Blind program in the Social Security Act passed in 1935. In 1972, the Aid to the Blind program and two others combined under Title XVI of the Social Security Act to form the Supplemental Security Income program which states: > An individual shall be considered to be blind for purposes of this title if > he has central visual acuity of 20/200 or less in the better eye with the > use of a correcting lens. An eye which is accompanied by a limitation in the > fields of vision such that the widest diameter of the visual field subtends > an angle no greater than 20 degrees shall be considered for purposes of the > first sentence of this subsection as having a central visual acuity of > 20/200 or less. An individual shall also be considered to be blind for > purposes of this title if he is blind as defined under a State plan approved > under title X or XVI as in effect for October 1972 and received aid under > such plan (on the basis of blindness) for December 1973, so long as he is > continuously blind as so defined. Health effects Visual impairments may take many forms and be of varying degrees. Visual acuity alone is not always a good predictor of the degree of problems a person may have. Someone with relatively good acuity (e.g., 20/40) can have difficulty with daily functioning, while someone with worse acuity (e.g., 20/200) may function reasonably well if their visual demands are not great. The American Medical Association has estimated that the loss of one eye equals 25% impairment of the visual system and 24% impairment of the whole person; total loss of vision in both eyes is considered to be 100% visual impairment and 85% impairment of the whole person. Some people who fall into this category can use their considerable residual vision ‚Äì their remaining sight ‚Äì to complete daily tasks without relying on alternative methods. The role of a low vision specialist (optometrist or ophthalmologist) is to maximize the functional level of a patient's vision by optical or non-optical means. Primarily, this is by use of magnification in the form of telescopic systems for distance vision and optical or electronic magnification for near tasks. People with significantly reduced acuity may benefit from training conducted by individuals trained in the provision of technical aids. Low vision rehabilitation professionals, some of whom are connected to an agency for the blind, can provide advice on lighting and contrast to maximize remaining vision. These professionals also have access to non-visual aids, and can instruct patients in their uses. The subjects making the most use of rehabilitation instruments, who lived alone, and preserved their own mobility and occupation were the least depressed, with the lowest risk of suicide and the highest level of social integration. Those with worsening sight and the prognosis of eventual blindness are at comparatively high risk of suicide and thus may be in need of supportive services. Many studies have demonstrated how rapid acceptance of the serious visual handicap has led to a better, more productive compliance with rehabilitation programs. Moreover, psychological distress has been reported to be at its highest when sight loss is not complete, but the prognosis is unfavorable. Therefore, early intervention is imperative for enabling successful psychological adjustment. =Associated problems= Blindness can occur in combination with such conditions as intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, hearing impairments, and epilepsy. Blindness in combination with hearing loss is known as deafblindness. It has been estimated that over half of completely blind people have non-24-hour sleep‚Äìwake disorder, a condition in which a person's circadian rhythm, normally slightly longer than 24 hours, is not entrained (synchronized) to the lightdark cycle. Cause The most common causes of visual impairment globally in 2010 were: #Refractive error (42%) #Cataract (33%) #Glaucoma (2%) #Age-related macular degeneration (1%) #Corneal opacification (1%) #Diabetic retinopathy (1%) #Childhood blindness #Trachoma (1%) #Undetermined (18%) The most common causes of blindness worldwide in 2010 were: #Cataracts (51%) #Glaucoma (8%) #Age-related macular degeneration (5%) #Corneal opacification (4%) #Childhood blindness (4%) #Refractive errors (3%) #Trachoma (3%) #Diabetic retinopathy (1%) #Undetermined (21%) About 90% of people who are visually impaired live in the developing world. Age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy are the leading causes of blindness in the developed world. Among working-age adults who are newly blind in England and Wales the most common causes in 2010 were: #Hereditary retinal disorders (20.2%) #Diabetic retinopathy (14.4%) #Optic atrophy (14.1%) #Glaucoma (5.9%) #Congenital abnormalities (5.1%) #Disorders of the visual cortex (4.1%) #Cerebrovascular disease (3.2%) #Degeneration of the macula and posterior pole (3.0%) #Myopia (2.8%) #Corneal disorders (2.6%) #Malignant neoplasms of the brain and nervous system (1.5%) #Retinal detachment (1.4%) =Cataracts= Cataracts are the congenital and pediatric pathology that describes the greying or opacity of the crystalline lens, which is most commonly caused by intrauterine infections, metabolic disorders, and genetically transmitted syndromes. Cataracts are the leading cause of child and adult blindness that doubles in prevalence with every ten years after the age of 40. Consequently, today cataracts are more common among adults than in children. That is, people face higher chances of developing cataracts as they age. Nonetheless, cataracts tend to have a greater financial and emotional toll upon children as they must undergo expensive diagnosis, long term rehabilitation, and visual assistance. Also, according to the Saudi Journal for Health Sciences, sometimes patients experience irreversible amblyopia after pediatric cataract surgery because the cataracts prevented the normal maturation of vision prior to operation. Despite the great progress in treatment, cataracts remain a global problem in both economically developed and developing countries. At present, with the variant outcomes as well as the unequal access to cataract surgery, the best way to reduce the risk of developing cataracts is to avoid smoking and extensive exposure to sun light (i.e. UV-B rays). =Glaucoma= Glaucoma is a congenital and pediatric eye disease characterized by increased pressure within the eye or intraocular pressure (IOP).<>. Glaucoma causes visual field loss as well as severs the optic nerve.Glaucoma Research Foundation. \\"High Eye Pressure and Glaucoma.\\" Glaucoma Research Foundation. N.p., 5 Sept. 2013. Web.<>. Early diagnosis and treatment of glaucoma in patients is imperative because glaucoma is triggered by non-specific levels of IOP. Also, another challenge in accurately diagnosing glaucoma is that the disease has four causes: 1) inflammatory ocular hypertension syndrome (IOHS); 2) severe uveitic angle closure; 3) corticosteroid-induced; and 4) a heterogonous mechanism associated with structural change and chronic inflammation. In addition, often pediatric glaucoma differs greatly in cause and management from the glaucoma developed by adults. Currently, the best sign of pediatric glaucoma is an IOP of 21 mm Hg or greater present within a child. One of the most common causes of pediatric glaucoma is cataract removal surgery, which leads to an incidence rate of about 12.2% among infants and 58.7% among 10-year-olds. =Infections= The burden of onchocerciasis: children leading blind adults in Africa Childhood blindness can be caused by conditions related to pregnancy, such as congenital rubella syndrome and retinopathy of prematurity. Leprosy and onchocerciasis each blind approximately 1 million individuals in the developing world. The number of individuals blind from trachoma has decreased in the past 10 years from 6 million to 1.3 million, putting it in seventh place on the list of causes of blindness worldwide. Central corneal ulceration is also a significant cause of monocular blindness worldwide, accounting for an estimated 850,000 cases of corneal blindness every year in the Indian subcontinent alone. As a result, corneal scarring from all causes is now the fourth greatest cause of global blindness.(Vaughan & Asbury's General Ophthalmology, 17e) =Injuries= Re-educating wounded. Blind French soldiers learning to make baskets, World War I. Eye injuries, most often occurring in people under 30, are the leading cause of monocular blindness (vision loss in one eye) throughout the United States. Injuries and cataracts affect the eye itself, while abnormalities such as optic nerve hypoplasia affect the nerve bundle that sends signals from the eye to the back of the brain, which can lead to decreased visual acuity. Cortical blindness results from injuries to the occipital lobe of the brain that prevent the brain from correctly receiving or interpreting signals from the optic nerve. Symptoms of cortical blindness vary greatly across individuals and may be more severe in periods of exhaustion or stress. It is common for people with cortical blindness to have poorer vision later in the day. Blinding has been used as an act of vengeance and torture in some instances, to deprive a person of a major sense by which they can navigate or interact within the world, act fully independently, and be aware of events surrounding them. An example from the classical realm is Oedipus, who gouges out his own eyes after realizing that he fulfilled the awful prophecy spoken of him. Having crushed the Bulgarians, the Byzantine Emperor Basil II blinded as many as 15,000 prisoners taken in the battle, before releasing them.Finlay, George (1856). History of the Byzantine Empire from DCCXVI to MLVII, 2nd Edition, Published by W. Blackwood, pp. 444‚Äì445. Contemporary examples include the addition of methods such as acid throwing as a form of disfigurement. =Genetic defects= People with albinism often have vision loss to the extent that many are legally blind, though few of them actually cannot see. Leber congenital amaurosis can cause total blindness or severe sight loss from birth or early childhood. Recent advances in mapping of the human genome have identified other genetic causes of low vision or blindness. One such example is Bardet‚ÄìBiedl syndrome. =Poisoning= Rarely, blindness is caused by the intake of certain chemicals. A well-known example is methanol, which is only mildly toxic and minimally intoxicating, and breaks down into the substances formaldehyde and formic acid which in turn can cause blindness, an array of other health complications, and death. When competing with ethanol for metabolism, ethanol is metabolized first, and the onset of toxicity is delayed. Methanol is commonly found in methylated spirits, denatured ethyl alcohol, to avoid paying taxes on selling ethanol intended for human consumption. Methylated spirits are sometimes used by alcoholics as a desperate and cheap substitute for regular ethanol alcoholic beverages. =Other= * Amblyopia: is a category of vision loss or visual impairment that is caused by factors unrelated to refractive errors or coexisting ocular diseases. Amblyopia is the condition when a child's visual systems fail to mature normally because the child either suffers from a premature birth, measles, congenital rubella syndrome, vitamin A deficiency, or meningitis. If left untreated during childhood, amblyopia is currently incurable in adulthood because surgical treatment effectiveness changes as a child matures. Consequently, amblyopia is the world's leading cause of child monocular vision loss, which is the damage or loss of vision in one eye. In the best case scenario, which is very rare, properly treated amblyopia patients can regain 20/40 acuity. * Corneal opacification * Degenerative myopia * Diabetic retinopathy: is one of the manifestation microvascular complications of diabetes, which is characterized by blindness or reduced acuity. That is, diabetic retinopathy describes the retinal and vitreous hemorrhages or retinal capillary blockage caused by the increase of A1C, which a measurement of blood glucose or sugar level. In fact, as A1C increases, people tend to be at greater risk of developing diabetic retinopathy than developing other microvascular complications associated with diabetes (e.g. chronic hyperglycemia, diabetic neuropathy, and diabetic nephropathy). Despite the fact that only 8% of adults 40 years and older experience vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy (e.g. nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy or NPDR and proliferative diabetic retinopathy or PDR), this eye diseased accounted for 17% of cases of blindness in 2002. * Retinitis pigmentosa * Retinopathy of prematurity: The most common cause of blindness in infants worldwide. In its most severe form, ROP causes retinal detachment, with attendant visual loss. Treatment is aimed mainly at prevention, via laser or Avastin therapy. * Stargardt's disease * Uveitis: is a group of 30 intraocular inflammatory diseases caused by infections, systemic diseases, organ-specific autoimmune processes, cancer or trauma. That is, uveitis refers to a complex category of ocular diseases that can cause blindness if either left untreated or improperly diagnosed. The current challenge of accurately diagnosing uveitis is that often the cause of a specific ocular inflammation is either unknown or multi-layered. Consequently, about 3‚Äì10% uveitis victims in developed countries, and about 25% of victims in the developing countries, become blind from incorrect diagnosis and from ineffectual prescription of drugs, antibiotics or steroids. In addition, uveitis is a diverse category of eye diseases that are subdivided as granulomatous (or tumorous) or non- granulomatous anterior, intermediate, posterior or pan uveitis. In other words, uveitis diseases tend to be classified by their anatomic location in the eye (e.g. uveal tract, retina, or lens), as well as can create complication that can cause cataracts, glaucoma, retinal damage, age-related macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy. *Xerophthalmia, often due to vitamin A deficiency, is estimated to affect 5 million children each year; 500,000 develop active corneal involvement, and half of these go blind. Diagnosis Scientists track eye movements in glaucoma patients to check vision impairment while driving It is important that people be examined by someone specializing in low vision care prior to other rehabilitation training to rule out potential medical or surgical correction for the problem and to establish a careful baseline refraction and prescription of both normal and low vision glasses and optical aids. Only a doctor is qualified to evaluate visual functioning of a compromised visual system effectively. The American Medical Association provides an approach to evaluating visual loss as it affects an individual's ability to perform activities of daily living. Screening adults who have no symptoms is of uncertain benefit. Prevention The World Health Organization estimates that 80% of visual loss is either preventable or curable with treatment. This includes cataracts, onchocerciasis, trachoma, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, uncorrected refractive errors, and some cases of childhood blindness. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that half of blindness in the United States is preventable. Management Tommy Edison, a blind film critic, demonstrates for his viewers how a blind person can cook alone. =Mobility= Folded long cane A blind man is assisted by a guide dog in Bras√≠lia, Brazil Mana village, Uttarakhand Visually impaired girl negotiating a rock while rock climbing Many people with serious visual impairments can travel independently, using a wide range of tools and techniques. Orientation and mobility specialists are professionals who are specifically trained to teach people with visual impairments how to travel safely, confidently, and independently in the home and the community. These professionals can also help blind people to practice travelling on specific routes which they may use often, such as the route from one's house to a convenience store. Becoming familiar with an environment or route can make it much easier for a blind person to navigate successfully. Tools such as the white cane with a red tip ‚Äì the international symbol of blindness ‚Äì may also be used to improve mobility. A long cane is used to extend the user's range of touch sensation. It is usually swung in a low sweeping motion, across the intended path of travel, to detect obstacles. However, techniques for cane travel can vary depending on the user and/or the situation. Some visually impaired persons do not carry these kinds of canes, opting instead for the shorter, lighter identification (ID) cane. Still others require a support cane. The choice depends on the individual's vision, motivation, and other factors. A small number of people employ guide dogs to assist in mobility. These dogs are trained to navigate around various obstacles, and to indicate when it becomes necessary to go up or down a step. However, the helpfulness of guide dogs is limited by the inability of dogs to understand complex directions. The human half of the guide dog team does the directing, based upon skills acquired through previous mobility training. In this sense, the handler might be likened to an aircraft's navigator, who must know how to get from one place to another, and the dog to the pilot, who gets them there safely. GPS devices can also be used as a mobility aid. Such software can assist blind people with orientation and navigation, but it is not a replacement for traditional mobility tools such as white canes and guide dogs. Some blind people are skilled at echolocating silent objects simply by producing mouth clicks and listening to the returning echoes. It has been shown that blind echolocation experts use what is normally the \\"visual\\" part of their brain to process the echoes. Government actions are sometimes taken to make public places more accessible to blind people. Public transportation is freely available to the blind in many cities. Tactile paving and audible traffic signals can make it easier and safer for visually impaired pedestrians to cross streets. In addition to making rules about who can and cannot use a cane, some governments mandate the right-of-way be given to users of white canes or guide dogs. =Reading and magnification= Braille watch Most visually impaired people who are not totally blind read print, either of a regular size or enlarged by magnification devices. Many also read large- print, which is easier for them to read without such devices. A variety of magnifying glasses, some handheld, and some on desktops, can make reading easier for them. Others read braille (or the infrequently used Moon type), or rely on talking books and readers or reading machines, which convert printed text to speech or braille. They use computers with special hardware such as scanners and refreshable braille displays as well as software written specifically for the blind, such as optical character recognition applications and screen readers. Some people access these materials through agencies for the blind, such as the National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped in the United States, the National Library for the Blind or the RNIB in the United Kingdom. Closed-circuit televisions, equipment that enlarges and contrasts textual items, are a more high-tech alternative to traditional magnification devices. There are also over 100 radio reading services throughout the world that provide people with vision impairments with readings from periodicals over the radio. The International Association of Audio Information Services provides links to all of these organizations. =Computers and mobile technology= Access technology such as screen readers, screen magnifiers and refreshable braille displays enable the blind to use mainstream computer applications and mobile phones. The availability of assistive technology is increasing, accompanied by concerted efforts to ensure the accessibility of information technology to all potential users, including the blind. Later versions of Microsoft Windows include an Accessibility Wizard & Magnifier for those with partial vision, and Microsoft Narrator, a simple screen reader. Linux distributions (as live CDs) for the blind include Vinux and Adriane Knoppix, the latter developed in part by Adriane Knopper who has a visual impairment. macOS and iOS also come with a built-in screen reader called VoiceOver, while Google TalkBack is built in to most Android devices. The movement towards greater web accessibility is opening a far wider number of websites to adaptive technology, making the web a more inviting place for visually impaired surfers. Experimental approaches in sensory substitution are beginning to provide access to arbitrary live views from a camera. Modified visual output that includes large print and/or clear simple graphics can be of benefit to users with some residual vision.Gregor, P., Newell, A.F., Zajicek, M. (2002). Designing for Dynamic Diversity ‚Äì interfaces for older people. Proceedings of the fifth international ACM conference on Assistive technologies. Edinburgh, Scotland. Session: Solutions for aging. Pages 151‚Äì156. =Other aids and techniques= tactile feature on a Canadian banknote Blind people may use talking equipment such as thermometers, watches, clocks, scales, calculators, and compasses. They may also enlarge or mark dials on devices such as ovens and thermostats to make them usable. Other techniques used by blind people to assist them in daily activities include: *Adaptations of coins and banknotes so that the value can be determined by touch. For example: ** In some currencies, such as the euro, the pound sterling and the Indian rupee, the size of a note increases with its value. ** On US coins, pennies and dimes, and nickels and quarters are similar in size. The larger denominations (dimes and quarters) have ridges along the sides (historically used to prevent the \\"shaving\\" of precious metals from the coins), which can now be used for identification. ** Some currencies' banknotes have a tactile feature to indicate denomination. For example, the Canadian currency tactile feature is a system of raised dots in one corner, based on braille cells but not standard braille. ** It is also possible to fold notes in different ways to assist recognition. *Labeling and tagging clothing and other personal items *Placing different types of food at different positions on a dinner plate *Marking controls of household appliances Most people, once they have been visually impaired for long enough, devise their own adaptive strategies in all areas of personal and professional management. For the blind, there are books in braille, audio-books, and text- to-speech computer programs, machines and e-book readers. Low vision people can make use of these tools as well as large-print reading materials and e-book readers that provide large font sizes. Computers are important tools of integration for the visually impaired person. They allow, using standard or specific programs, screen magnification and conversion of text into sound or touch (braille line), and are useful for all levels of visual handicap. OCR scanners can, in conjunction with text-to-speech software, read the contents of books and documents aloud via computer. Vendors also build closed-circuit televisions that electronically magnify paper, and even change its contrast and color, for visually impaired users. For more information, consult Assistive technology. In adults with low vision there is no conclusive evidence supporting one form of reading aid over another. In several studies stand-mounted devices allowed faster reading than hand-held or portable optical aids. While electronic aids may allow faster reading for individuals with low vision, portability, ease of use, and affordability must be considered for people. Children with low vision sometimes have reading delays, but do benefit from phonics-based beginning reading instruction methods. Engaging phonics instruction is multisensory, highly motivating, and hands-on. Typically students are first taught the most frequent sounds of the alphabet letters, especially the so-called short vowel sounds, then taught to blend sounds together with three-letter consonant-vowel-consonant words such as cat, red, sit, hot, sun. Hands-on (or kinesthetically appealing) VERY enlarged print materials such as those found in \\"The Big Collection of Phonics Flipbooks\\" by Lynn Gordon (Scholastic, 2010) are helpful for teaching word families and blending skills to beginning readers with low vision. Beginning reading instructional materials should focus primarily on the lower-case letters, not the capital letters (even though they are larger) because reading text requires familiarity (mostly) with lower-case letters. Phonics-based beginning reading should also be supplemented with phonemic awareness lessons, writing opportunities, and many read-alouds (literature read to children daily) to stimulate motivation, vocabulary development, concept development, and comprehension skill development. Many children with low vision can be successfully included in regular education environments. Parents may need to be vigilant to ensure that the school provides the teacher and students with appropriate low vision resources, for example technology in the classroom, classroom aide time, modified educational materials, and consultation assistance with low vision experts. =Communication= Communication with the visually impaired can be more difficult than communicating with someone who doesn't have vision loss. However, many people are uncomfortable with communicating with the blind, and this can cause communication barriers. One of the biggest obstacles in communicating with visually impaired individuals comes from face-to-face interactions.Bialistock, R. (2005). Towards better communication, from the interest point of view. or-skills of sight-glish for the blind and visually impaired. International Congress Series, 1282, 793‚Äì795. There are many factors that can cause the sighted to become uncomfortable while communicating face to face. There are many non-verbal factors that hinder communication between the visually impaired and the sighted, more often than verbal factors do. These factors, which Rivka Bialistock mentions in her article, include: *Lack of facial expressions, mimics, or body gestures/responses *Non-verbal gestures that could imply the visually impaired individual not appearing interested *Speaking when not anticipated or not speaking when anticipated *Fear of offending the visually impaired *Standing too close and invading the personal comfort level *Having to exercise or ignore feelings of pity *Being uncomfortable with touching objects or people *A look of detachment or disengagement *Dependency *Being reminded of the fear of becoming blind The blind person sends these signals or types of non-verbal communication without being aware that they are doing so. These factors can all affect the way an individual would feel about communicating with the visually impaired. This leaves the visually impaired feeling rejected and lonely. Adjusting attitude In the article Towards better communication, from the interest point of view. Or‚Äîskills of sight-glish for the blind and visually impaired, the author, Rivka Bialistock comes up with a method to reduce individuals being uncomfortable with communicating with the visually impaired. This method is called blind-glish or sight-glish, which is a language for the blind, similar to English. For example, babies, who are not born and able to talk right away, communicate through sight-glish, simply seeing everything and communicating non-verbally. This comes naturally to sighted babies, and by teaching this same method to babies with a visual impairment can improve their ability to communicate better, from the very beginning. To avoid the rejected feeling of the visually impaired, people need to treat the blind the same way they would treat anyone else, rather than treating them like they have a disability, and need special attention. People may feel that it is improper to, for example, tell their blind child to look at them when they are speaking. However, this contributes to the sight-glish method. It is important to disregard any mental fears or uncomfortable feelings people have while communicating (verbally and non-verbally) face-to- face. Surroundings Individuals with a visual disability not only have to find ways to communicate effectively with the people around them, but their environment as well. The blind or visually impaired rely largely on their other senses such as hearing, touch, and smell in order to understand their surroundings. =Sound= Sound is one of the most important senses that the blind or visually impaired use in order to locate objects in their surroundings. A form of echolocation is used, similarly to that of a bat. Echolocation from a person's perspective is when the person uses sound waves generated from speech or other forms of noise such as cane tapping, which reflect off of objects and bounce back at the person giving them a rough idea of where the object is. This does not mean they can depict details based on sound but rather where objects are in order to interact, or avoid them. Increases in atmospheric pressure and humidity increase a person's ability to use sound to their advantage as wind or any form of background noise impairs it. =Touch= Touch is also an important aspect of how blind or visually impaired people perceive the world. Touch gives immense amount of information in the person's immediate surrounding. Feeling anything with detail gives off information on shape, size, texture, temperature, and many other qualities. Touch also helps with communication; braille is a form of communication in which people use their fingers to feel elevated bumps on a surface and can understand what is meant to be interpreted. There are some issues and limitations with touch as not all objects are accessible to feel, which makes it difficult to perceive the actual object. Another limiting factor is that the learning process of identifying objects with touch is much slower than identifying objects with sight. This is due to the fact the object needs to be approached and carefully felt until a rough idea can be constructed in the brain. =Smell= Certain smells can be associated with specific areas and help a person with vision problems to remember a familiar area. This way there is a better chance of recognizing an area's layout in order to navigate themselves through. The same can be said for people as well. Some people have their own special odor that a person with a more trained sense of smell can pick up. A person with an impairment of their vision can use this to recognize people within their vicinity without them saying a word. Communication development Visual impairment can have profound effects on the development of infant and child communication. The language and social development of a child or infant can be very delayed by the inability to see the world around them. =Social development= Social development includes interactions with the people surrounding the infant in the beginning of its life. To a child with vision, a smile from a parent is the first symbol of recognition and communication, and is almost an instant factor of communication. For a visually impaired infant, recognition of a parent's voice will be noticed at approximately two months old, but a smile will only be evoked through touch between parent and baby. This primary form of communication is greatly delayed for the child and will prevent other forms of communication from developing. Social interactions are more complicated because subtle visual cues are missing and facial expressions from others are lost. Due to delays in a child's communication development, they may appear to be disinterested in social activity with peers, non-communicative and uneducated on how to communicate with other people. This may cause the child to be avoided by peers and consequently overprotected by family members. =Language development= With sight, much of what is learned by a child is learned through imitation of others, whereas a visually impaired child needs very planned instruction directed at the development of postponed imitation. A visually impaired infant may jabber and imitate words sooner than a sighted child, but may show delay when combining words to say themselves, the child may tend to initiate few questions and their use of adjectives is infrequent. Normally the child's sensory experiences are not readily coded into language and this may cause them to store phrases and sentences in their memory and repeat them out of context. The language of the blind child does not seem to mirror their developing knowledge of the world, but rather their knowledge of the language of others. A visually impaired child may also be hesitant to explore the world around them due to fear of the unknown and also may be discouraged from exploration by overprotective family members. Without concrete experiences, the child is not able to develop meaningful concepts or the language to describe or think about them.Strickling, C., (2010, October 6). Impact Of Visual Impairment On Development. Texas, USA Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired =Healthcare access= Visual impairment has the ability to create consequences for health and well being. Visual impairment is increasing, especially among older people. It is recognized that those individuals with visual impairment are likely to have limited access to information and healthcare facilities, and may not receive the best care possible because not all health care professionals are aware of specific needs related to vision. Accommodation may require alternative means of communication. Epidemiology The WHO estimates that in 2012 there were 285 million visually impaired people in the world, of which 246 million had low vision and 39 million were blind. Of those who are blind 90% live in the developing world. Worldwide for each blind person, an average of 3.4 people have low vision, with country and regional variation ranging from 2.4 to 5.5.World Health Organization By age: Visual impairment is unequally distributed across age groups. More than 82% of all people who are blind are 50 years of age and older, although they represent only 19% of the world's population. Due to the expected number of years lived in blindness (blind years), childhood blindness remains a significant problem, with an estimated 1.4 million blind children below age 15. By gender: Available studies consistently indicate that in every region of the world, and at all ages, females have a significantly higher risk of being visually impaired than males. By geography: Visual impairment is not distributed uniformly throughout the world. More than 90% of the world's visually impaired live in developing countries. Since the estimates of the 1990s, new data based on the 2002 global population show a reduction in the number of people who are blind or visually impaired, and those who are blind from the effects of infectious diseases, but an increase in the number of people who are blind from conditions related to longer life spans. In 1987, it was estimated that 598,000 people in the United States met the legal definition of blindness. Of this number, 58% were over the age of 65. In 1994‚Äì1995, 1.3 million Americans reported legal blindness. Society and culture =Legal definition= To determine which people qualify for special assistance because of their visual disabilities, various governments have specific definitions for legal blindness. In North America and most of Europe, legal blindness is defined as visual acuity (vision) of 20/200 (6/60) or less in the better eye with best correction possible. This means that a legally blind individual would have to stand from an object to see it‚Äîwith corrective lenses‚Äîwith the same degree of clarity as a normally sighted person could from . In many areas, people with average acuity who nonetheless have a visual field of less than 20 degrees (the norm being 180 degrees) are also classified as being legally blind. Approximately fifteen percent of those deemed legally blind, by any measure, have no light or form perception. The rest have some vision, from light perception alone to relatively good acuity. Low vision is sometimes used to describe visual acuities from 20/70 to 20/200. =Literature and art= Antiquity The Moche people of ancient Peru depicted the blind in their ceramics.Berrin, Katherine & Larco Museum. The Spirit of Ancient Peru:Treasures from the Museo Arqueol√≥gico Rafael Larco Herrera. New York: Thames and Hudson, 1997. In Greek myth, Tiresias was a prophet famous for his clairvoyance. According to one myth, he was blinded by the gods as punishment for revealing their secrets, while another holds that he was blinded as punishment after he saw Athena naked while she was bathing. In the Odyssey, the one-eyed Cyclops Polyphemus captures Odysseus, who blinds Polyphemus to escape. In Norse mythology, Loki tricks the blind god H√∂√∞r into killing his brother Baldr, the god of happiness. The New Testament contains numerous instances of Jesus performing miracles to heal the blind. According to the Gospels, Jesus healed the two blind men of Galilee, the blind man of Bethsaida, the blind man of Jericho and the man who was born blind. The parable of the blind men and an elephant has crossed between many religious traditions and is part of Jain, Buddhist, Sufi and Hindu lore. In various versions of the tale, a group of blind men (or men in the dark) touch an elephant to learn what it is like. Each one feels a different part, but only one part, such as the side or the tusk. They then compare notes and learn that they are in complete disagreement. \\"Three Blind Mice\\" is a medieval English nursery rhyme about three blind mice whose tails are cut off after chasing the farmer's wife. The work is explicitly incongruous, ending with the comment Did you ever see such a sight in your life, As three blind mice? Modern times Blind Woman by Diego Vel√°zquez The Sense of Touch by Jusepe de Ribera depicts a blind man holding a marble head in his hands. Poet John Milton, who went blind in mid-life, composed On His Blindness, a sonnet about coping with blindness. The work posits that [those] who best Bear [God]'s mild yoke, they serve him best. The Dutch painter and engraver Rembrandt often depicted scenes from the apocryphal Book of Tobit, which tells the story of a blind patriarch who is healed by his son, Tobias, with the help of the archangel Raphael.Julius Held, Rembrandt and the Book of Tobit, Gehenna Press, Northampton MA, 1964. Slaver-turned-abolitionist John Newton composed the hymn Amazing Grace about a wretch who \\"once was lost, but now am found, Was blind, but now I see.\\" Blindness, in this sense, is used both metaphorically (to refer to someone who was ignorant but later became knowledgeable) and literally, as a reference to those healed in the Bible. In the later years of his life, Newton himself would go blind. H. G. Wells' story \\"The Country of the Blind\\" explores what would happen if a sighted man found himself trapped in a country of blind people to emphasise society's attitude to blind people by turning the situation on its head. Bob Dylan's anti-war song \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" twice alludes to metaphorical blindness: How many times can a man turn his head // and pretend that he just doesn't see... How many times must a man look up // Before he can see the sky? Contemporary fiction contains numerous well-known blind characters. Some of these characters can see by means of devices, such as the Marvel Comics superhero Daredevil, who can see via his super-human hearing acuity, or Star Trek's Geordi La Forge, who can see with the aid of a VISOR, a fictional device that transmits optical signals to his brain. =Sports= Blind and partially sighted people participate in sports, such as swimming, snow skiing and athletics. Some sports have been invented or adapted for the blind, such as goalball, association football, cricket, golf, tennis, bowling, and beep baseball. The worldwide authority on sports for the blind is the International Blind Sports Federation. People with vision impairments have participated in the Paralympic Games since the 1976 Toronto summer Paralympics. =Metaphorical uses= The word \\"blind\\" (adjective and verb) is often used to signify a lack of knowledge of something. For example, a blind date is a date in which the people involved have not previously met; a blind experiment is one in which information is kept from either the experimenter or the participant to mitigate the placebo effect or observer bias. The expression \\"blind leading the blind\\" refers to incapable people leading other incapable people. Being blind to something means not understanding or being aware of it. A \\"blind spot\\" is an area where someone cannot see: for example, where a car driver cannot see because parts of his car's bodywork are in the way; metaphorically, a topic on which an individual is unaware of their own biases, and therefore of the resulting distortions of their own judgements (see Bias blind spot). Research A 2008 study tested the effect of using gene therapy to help restore the sight of patients with a rare form of inherited blindness, known as Leber's congenital amaurosis or LCA. Leber's Congenital Amaurosis damages the light receptors in the retina and usually begins affecting sight in early childhood, with worsening vision until complete blindness around the age of 30. The study used a common cold virus to deliver a normal version of the gene called RPE65 directly into the eyes of affected patients. Remarkably, all 3 patients, aged 19, 22 and 25, responded well to the treatment and reported improved vision following the procedure. Due to the age of the patients and the degenerative nature of LCA, the improvement of vision in gene therapy patients is encouraging for researchers. It is hoped that gene therapy may be even more effective in younger LCA patients who have experienced limited vision loss, as well as in other blind or partially blind individuals. Two experimental treatments for retinal problems include a cybernetic replacement and transplant of fetal retinal cells. There is no high-quality evidence on the effect of assistive technologies on educational outcomes and quality of life in children with low vision as of 2015, nor is there evidence on magnifying reading aids in children. Low-vision rehabilitation does not appear to have an important impact on health-related quality of life, though some low-vision rehabilitation interventions, particularly psychological therapies and methods of enhancing vision, may improve vision-related quality of life in people with sight loss. Other animals Statements that certain species of mammals are \\"born blind\\" refers to them being born with their eyes closed and their eyelids fused together; the eyes open later. One example is the rabbit. In humans, the eyelids are fused for a while before birth, but open again before the normal birth time; however, very premature babies are sometimes born with their eyes fused shut, and opening later. Other animals, such as the blind mole rat, are truly blind and rely on other senses. The theme of blind animals has been a powerful one in literature. Peter Shaffer's Tony Award-winning play, Equus, tells the story of a boy who blinds six horses. Theodore Taylor's classic young adult novel, The Trouble With Tuck, is about a teenage girl, Helen, who trains her blind dog to follow and trust a seeing-eye dog.

Roberts is a founding member of the famed Upright Citizens Brigade improv and sketch comedy troupe. Life and career Roberts was born in Queens, New York, to parents Don and Penny Roberts, but spent the majority of his childhood in Secaucus, New Jersey, where he moved at age four.Comic who grew up in Secaucus stars in a new Spike TV series Roberts is a 1987 graduate of Grinnell College in Iowa, where he majored in theater. After graduating from college, Roberts moved to Milwaukee and eventually to Chicago where he became involved in improvisational comedy, studying improv under comedy legend Del Close. In the early 1990s, Roberts and Matt Besser (along with several other Chicago improv comics) would eventually form the Upright Citizens Brigade sketch comedy troupe. Amy Poehler and Matt Walsh would later join the group, forming the UCB foursome who went on to create their own Comedy Central series and later opened the affiliated Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in New York and Los Angeles. Both theaters have become well-known hotspots for watching live alternative comedy and improv shows and in recent years have helped launch the careers of many of today's most popular comedians. Roberts wrote and starred in the limited release film Martin & Orloff, and appeared with memorable supporting roles in films such as Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, Bring It On, Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, Drillbit Taylor, Reno 911!: Miami and Semi-Pro. On the Upright Citizens Brigade's sketch series on Comedy Central, Roberts was often seen as the UCB Agent Antoine, but also portrayed many other sketch characters such as Steve Youngblood and Astronaut Mike Birchwood. A running joke on the sketch series was that his character (Agent Antoine) was thought by the other UCB Agents (Colby, Trotter, Adair) to be a cyborg despite his constant assertions to the contrary. Roberts, along with his other UCB castmates, has regularly appeared in sketch comedy segments on Late Night with Conan O'Brien for many years. Roberts also had a recurring character in the sitcom Arrested Development, Dr. Fishman (AKA The Literal Doctor, AKA Dr. Wordsmith), and also returned for several episodes for the show's revived 4th season on Netflix in 2013. Roberts was one of the additions to the cast of Reno 911! in its final season, playing the role of Sgt. Jack Declan. In 2010. Roberts starred alongside UCB partner Matt Walsh in the Spike TV improvised comedy series Players, which was created by Walsh. Roberts and Walsh starred as two brothers who run a sports bar, the two also directed several episodes on the show. The series ran for one season, concluding on August 14, 2010. In September 2010, Roberts appeared with Conan O'Brien in a series of commercials promoting O'Brien's new show on TBS. Roberts played the captain of the \\"Conan Blimp\\", with O'Brien riding along as a passenger. Roberts has written several screenplays with writing partner Jay Martel, one of which was recently sold to DreamWorks, with Steven Brill in talks to direct. Roberts and Martel wrote the script for the comedy Get Hard, starring Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart. Roberts and Martel were also the showrunners for all five seasons of the Comedy Central sketch series Key & Peele. They currently are executive producers and showrunners of the 2016 TV Land series Teachers. Personal life Roberts lives in Agoura Hills, California with his wife Katie and their two children, Declan and Josie.

After the aircraft reaches the decision height (DH) or decision altitude (DA), guidance is advisory only. Controllers monitoring the PAR displays observe each aircraft's position and issue instructions to the pilot that keep the aircraft on course and glidepath during final approach. It is similar to an instrument landing system (ILS) but requires control instructions. One type of instrument approach that can make use of PAR is the ground-controlled approach (GCA). Air traffic controllers must transmit a minimum of every 5 seconds to the pilot their relation to the azimuth portion and, once intercepting the glidepath, their elevation. The approach is terminated when the aircraft reaches the OCA/H (Obstacle Clearance Altitude/Height). Nevertheless, information is provided until threshold and aircraft may be monitored by controller until touchdown. Controller in charge of PAR should not be responsible for any duty other than the PAR approach concerned. The upper portion of the display indicates elevation, the lower portion azimuth. Controllers must be able to interpret radar returns for the azimuth as a \\"top view\\" to inform them if the aircraft is left or right of course. An Air Force air traffic controller is reflected in the precision approach radar scope (1980) Precision approach radars are most frequently used at military air traffic control facilities. Many of these facilities use the AN/FPN-63, AN/MPN, or AN/TPN-22. These radars can provide precision guidance to a distance of 10 to 20 miles. The OJ-333 Radar scope is the indicator which the air traffic controller uses to provide instructions to the pilots. In the United States, PAR are used mostly by the Navy. This is because they present a more covert type of precision approach for use on aircraft carriers. An ILS installed on a ship could provide guidance to enemy missiles, but a PAR does not provide accurate guidance without controller instruction. Non- traditional PAR using SSR transponder reply There are systems that provide PAR functionality without using primary radar. These non-traditional PAR systems use transponder multilateration, triangulation and/or trilateration. One such system, Transponder Landing System (TLS) precisely tracks aircraft using the mode 3/A transponder response received by antenna arrays located near the runway. These antennas are part of a measurement subsystem that is used to precisely determine the aircraft 3-dimensional position using TOA, DTOA and AOA measurement techniques. The aircraft position is then displayed on a high-resolution color graphics terminal that also shows the approach centerline and the glide path. A GCA controller is then able to use this screen for reference to issue GCA instructions to the pilot. The signal strength for the secondary surveillance radar subsystem of a non-traditional PAR is not attenuated by rain since the frequency is within the long range band, L-band. Therefore, a non-traditional PAR does not experience noticeable rain fade and in the case of the TLS has an operational range of 60 nm. This system is co-operative depending, it means that in the case of transponder failure no aircraft detection will be provided. Flight inspection of the PAR A traditional PAR flight inspection procedure is performed without a navigation signal available to compare directly to a truth reference. A traditional PAR is flight inspected by comparing written notes between two observers, one taking notes at a truth reference system such as a theodolite and the other observer taking notes while observing the radar console, see ICAO Document 8071. The Transponder Landing System (TLS) non-traditional PAR can transmit an ILS signal that corresponds to the aircraft position relative to the precision approach. Therefore, the graphical depiction can be directly verified using Instrument Landing System (ILS) flight inspection techniques. This direct measurement removes some ambiguity from the PAR flight inspection process.

The zoo holds various youth-directed programs, including Junior Zookeepers, birthday parties and holiday events.  Local Impact  Cosley Zoo and the Willowbrook Wildlife Center have teamed up in an effort to increase the population of the endangered Blanding's turtle. Eggs are incubated and hatched at the Willowbrook Wildlife Center, where the baby turtles also spend their first year of life. Their second year is spent at Cosley Zoo, and then they are released into the wild. The program has helped to release 2,100 turtles since 1996.

It opened as Cosley's Children's Park and Museum in August 1974. In 1975, the zoo acquired a retired caboose that sat next to the former train station. The zoo gained enough funding to expand by 2 acres in 1976. In the same year, the park changed its name to Cosley Animal Farm and Museum. In 1987, the Vern Keibler Learning Center was completed. The zoo continued adding exhibits and updating old ones to more natural-looking habitats. In 1999, the zoo staff and the Wheaton Park District decided to give the park its current name, Cosley Zoo. In 2000, the Zoo received accreditation by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. It started its work with the DuPage County Forest Preserve District to rehabilitate Illinois' Blanding's Turtle population in the same year. In 2008, Cosley Zoo worked with an Eagle Scout to turn the old caboose shell into an interactive learning exhibit.

Life Though born in Kiev, Pavel and his family moved to Moscow in 1922. He studied at the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute and at the Moscow Institute of History, Philosophy and Literature. Kogan twice hiked the trails of central Russia. He learned about World War II while on a geological expedition to Armenia. Returning immediately to Moscow, he tried to enlist in the army, but was turned down due to his poor health. Undeterred, he finished a series of courses and became a military interpreter. In 1942, Kogan was killed by the Germans while leading a reconnaissance mission, aged 24. All of his poems were published posthumously. They became famous during the Khrushchev Thaw, mainly due to a popular song called \\"Brigantina\\" (Brigantine, 1937) which was written using his lyrics.

Originally all on foot, in recent decades it has also featured one or two small floats. Fountain and other local jazz musicians played through much of the parade. The krewe's current route, basically unchanged since the mid-1970s, starts at 7 AM on Mardi Gras morning, at world-famous Commander's Palace Restaurant on Washington Avenue in the Garden District. The krewe then proceeds downtown on St. Charles Avenue and after a brief interlude on Canal Street, enters the French Quarter at Bourbon Street, winds around the Quarter and eventually ends up at the Monteleone Hotel in the early afternoon. The \\"Half-Fast\\" is one of the best known marching Krewes that parades in New Orleans on Mardi Gras. The original name was \\"The Half-Assed Walking Club\\" and was an excuse to take a \\"lubricated\\" musical stroll down the parade route. Pete changed the name under pressure exerted by the parade organizers. On Mardi Gras 2007 Pete once again joined his Half Fast Walking Club, having missed the event in 2006 due to illness. He died in 2016. One of the more famous members of the Half-Fast Walking Club was singer and bandleader Phil Harris famous as a Disney voice and as Jack Benny's orchestra leader. In his last appearance in 1990, Harris did not walk due to age but was chaufferred in a convertible while waving to the crowd and throwing trinkets.

It is the sixth-tallest building in the city. When completed in 1961, it surpassed the Simms Building to become the tallest building in the state, and was itself surpassed by the Bank of the West Tower two years later. The Bank of New Mexico Building, as it was originally known, was built in 1959‚Äì1961 on the site of the old Wright's Trading Post building at Fourth and Gold. The building was dedicated on January 16, 1961, in a ceremony featuring Native American dancers and a speech by a sombrero-wearing Winthrop Rockefeller, who was one of the original owners. The building's main 12-story block has black tinted glass curtain walls on the north and south sides, while the windowless east and west sides and the protruding elevator shaft on the south side are faced with brick. It sits atop a larger one-story base, with a recessed second story in between. The architect was Willard C. Kruger. History The Bank of New Mexico Building, as it was originally known, was built in 1959‚Äì1961 by the Bank Realty Company, which had Winthrop Rockefeller as one of its main partners. Rockefeller was also one of the developers of Winrock Center and would later be elected governor of Arkansas. Built on a five-lot parcel at 4th Street and Gold Avenue, the building replaced several older structures including Wright's Trading Post. It was dedicated on January 16, 1961, in a ceremony featuring Native American dancers and speeches by Rockefeller, dressed in a sombrero for the occasion, and Chairman of the City Commission Maurice Sanchez. The project's total cost was about $4 million. Designed by local architect Willard C. Kruger, the 14-story building surpassed the Simms Building across the street to become the tallest in New Mexico. The 14th floor housed the private Petroleum Club, while the namesake Bank of New Mexico had its headquarters on the ground floor. In 1981, the bank's holding company re-branded its banks with the First Interstate Bank name, and the building was renamed accordingly. The building was given a $5 million remodeling in 1986, which included major mechanical work as well as replacing the original curtain walls with the current black tinted glass. Kruger & Associates were the architects for the remodeling as well, though Kruger himself had died in 1984. The bank headquarters eventually ended up in the hands of Norwest Bank, which moved out in 1994 as it already had headquarters nearby. In 1996, The Bank of New Mexico (unrelated to the original bank) moved in and put its name on the building, but this bank was also acquired by Norwest two years later. Since the early 2000s it has been the headquarters of New Mexico Bank & Trust. Architecture The New Mexico Bank & Trust Building is tall and has 14 above-ground floors plus a mechanical penthouse. It was designed by Willard C. Kruger, who was also the architect of the New Mexico State Capitol among other works. Stylistically, it fits into the International Style and is quite similar in appearance to the older Simms Building across the street. Like the Simms Building, it has curtain walls on the north and south sides, windowless brick on the east and west sides, a recessed second story exposing the structural columns, and a larger one-story base. The curtain walls were originally clear glass alternating with opaque turquoise-colored panels, but this was replaced by black tinted glass set in a coral-colored frame during the 1986 remodeling. On the south side, the building has a protruding, brick- faced elevator shaft.

Baron Pentland was born John Sinclair to George Sinclair (1826-1871)son of Sir John Sinclair, 6th baronet of Dunbeath. He studied in the United Kingdom and in 1892, entered the House of Commons as an elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Dunbartonshire. He was elected for a second term from Forfar in 1897 and served in the British Parliament from 1892 to 1895 and 1897 to 1909. He also served as an Aide-de-Camp and secretary to Lord Aberdeen. Sinclair was appointed to the Privy Council in 1905. He served as the Secretary for Scotland from 1905 to 1912 and as the Governor of Madras from 1912 to 1919. He died in 1925. During his tenure as Governor of Madras, Pentland became popular in India for the interest he showed in the indigenous tradition and culture. At the same time, he is also remembered for his crackdown on Annie Besant and leaders of the Home Rule Movement. A radical Liberal, Sinclair was supportive of reforms aimed at promoting social justice. As noted by Veronica Strong-Boag \\"As much as anyone in the new Cabinet after the 1905 election, he embodied the new liberalism of state intervention on the side of the weak. He was also a staunch proponent of legislation tailored to Scottish circumstances. His advocacy of the Scottish Education Act of 1908, which provided for improved teacher training and school facilities and meals for students, very much followed the spirit of Lord Aberdeen‚Äôs practices on his own estates. So, too, did Sinclair‚Äôs support for legislation to secure the land rights of Scottish crofters.\\" Early life and ancestry John Sinclair was born at 6 Moray Place, Edinburgh to Captain John Sinclair (1826‚Äì1871), an officer in the Bengal Army and Agnes Sinclair, daughter of John Learmonth of Dean who constructed the Dean Bridge of Edinburgh, on 7 July 1860. John Sinclair was the eldest of three sons. Captain John Sinclair of Lyth was the grandson of Sir John Sinclair of Barrock, 6th baronet of Dunbeath, and descended from George Sinclair of Mey (himself third son of the 4th Earl of Caithness), who died 1616. He was thus a distant cousin of the contemporary Earls of Caithness who were descended from the 7th Baronet, of Mey.  Education and military career  Sinclair was educated at Edinburgh Academy and Wellington College. He left Wellington in 1878 and the next year passed out fifth from the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. On completion of the one-year Sandhurst course, Sinclair was commissioned into the 5th Royal Irish Lancers. He served in the Sudan expedition and returned as captain in 1887.Kelly, Pg 1339  Early political career  Sinclair participated in political activities from an early age. He was among those who moved to Toynbee Hall along with Samuel Augustus Barnett, where he strived to promote education and sport, and was one of the founders of the London Playing Fields Society, a sports ground established for the sake of the poor. Sinclair joined the Liberal Party in the 1880s and contested elections to the House of Commons from the Ayr Burghs in Scotland on the promise of Home Rule for Ireland, but lost. Pentland served as Aide-de-Camp and Official Secretary to Lord Aberdeen while he was serving as Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland in 1886, and had the same roles in Canada while Lord Aberdeen was Governor-General there. In January 1889 he was elected to the first London County Council as a Progressive councillor representing Finsbury East. He served a single three-year term, retiring from the council in 1892.  Parliament of the United Kingdom  In 1892, Sinclair was elected a Liberal Member of Parliament for Dunbartonshire, a seat he held until 1895, and returned to the Commons representing Forfarshire from 1897 to 1909. He then acted as Parliamentary Secretary to Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman for many years. He was appointed a Privy Councillor on 11 December 1905 and was created Baron Pentland, of Lyth in the County of Caithness on 15 February 1909. Marriage and family On 12 July 1904 he married Lady Marjorie Adeline Gordon (7 December 1880 ‚Äì 26 July 1970), elder daughter of his former patron the 1st Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair. They had two children # Henry John Sinclair, 2nd Baron Pentland, (b. 6 June 1907 d. 1984); succeeded his father 1925, also known as a former president of The Gurdjieff Foundation of New York; married 11 September 1941 Lucy Elisabeth Smith; they had issue 1 daughter, who is married, and lives in New York. # Hon. Margaret Ishbel Sinclair (b. October 1906) As Secretary for Scotland Pentland served as the Secretary for Scotland from 1905 to 1912. During his tenure, women's suffrage was introduced in the councils and Lavinia Malcolm was elected as provost of Dollar, Clackmannanshire, being both the first lady provost and first lady town councilor in Scotland., Numerous resolutions were passed to implement greater autonomy for Scotland but all of them failed when put to vote. Pentland introduced the Taxation of Land Values (Scotland) Bill which recommended the creation of a new Board of Agriculture for Scotland to implement a sweeping land settlement programme. However, though the bill was approved by the House of Commons it was defeated by the House of Lords. A second government bill by Pentland was also defeated by the House of Lords. Pentland was a favorite of the Prime Minister, Campbell-Bannerman. Pentland's Agriculture Act made the Secretary of Scotland answerable to the House of Commons for issues relating to agriculture. In 1907, he assured Scottish MPs in the House of Commons that the Government is aware of issues that plague Scotland. Pentland was Secretary of State for Scotland during the Oscar Slater miscarriage of justice in 1909. Although he commuted Slater's death penalty to life imprisonment he did not investigate concerns, raised by many including Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, that the Glasgow Police, James Neil Hart (the Procurator Fiscal) and the Lord Advocate Ure conspired to protect the then influential Charteris and Birrell families of Glasgow. Slater's appeal was upheld in 1928. In February 1912, Pentland retired as the Secretary for Scotland and was succeeded by T. McKinnon Wood. As Governor of Madras St Andrew's Kirk, Madras Pentland served as the Governor of Madras from 1912 to 1919. For the most part of his tenure as Governor of Madras, British India was embroiled in the First World War. =Construction of the Pamban Bridge= In June 1911, Arthur Lawley had commissioned the construction of a railway bridge connecting Pamban Island with the Indian mainland. The existing railway line ended with the town of Ramanathapuram and it was felt that its extension to Pamban island would boost trade and tourism. It would also make it easier for pilgrims to travel to the sacred Hindu shrine of Rameswaram. The construction of the 2.06 km long cantilever railway bridge was undertaken by the German engineer Scherzer and completed in 2 years at a cost of Rs. 2,000,000 by 600 workers with no loss of life. The bridge was opened by Lord Pentland for traffic on 24 February 1914. The Pamban bridge is India's largest sea bridge and an UNESCO World Heritage monument. =Pentland and Geddes= In 1914, Pentland invited the Scottish botanist and architect Patrick Geddes to conduct an exhibition on town-planning in Madras city. He reached Madras on 20 December 1914 after journeying overland from Calcutta through Vizagapatam, Guntur and Bellary.Geddes, Pg 256 Pentland had been interacting with Geddes and was fascinated with his models since 1890.Lady Pentland, Pg 213 Geddes had prepared for a detailed exhibition at Madras with a series of illustrations and maps. However, the ship by which they were slated to arrive in Madras, the \\"Clan Grant\\", was sunk to the south of Cape Comorin by the German ship Emden.Geddes, p. 253 This calamity delayed Geddes' visit to Madras by a couple of months and he had to recreate his presentations and illustrations. The Cities and Town Planning Exhibition opened in the senate of the Madras University on 17 January 1915 and was inaugurated by the Governor who also gave an introductory speech.Geddes, p. 260 Patrick Geddes gave a detailed lecture on cost-effective town planning and sanitation with the aid of real- life examples and a presentation with detailed illustrations and maps. Geddes spent the next few months in Madras touring the countryside and making reports and illustrations of the different towns in the Presidency. He persuaded Pentland to appoint a town planning advisor and suggested the name of H. V. Lancaster who was a Vice-President of the Royal Institute of British Architects. Accordingly, in October 1915, Lancaster joined the service of the Madras government. =During the First World War= Pentland set up a hospital ship which plied regularly between Africa and India and then, between India and the Middle East, caring for sailors injured at sea and treating them. This hospital ship was paid for and maintained by some of the prominent citizens of Madras. In 1914, the Department of Industries, which had earlier been disbanded in face of protests from the Madras Chamber of Commerce, was re- established. This department commenced the rapid industrialization of the province to cater to the economic and industrialization needs of the war. Factories manufacturing soap, ink, adhesives, paper-making, oil-pressing, food processing and decoration of groundnuts were established all over the province. Industries were set for manufacturing military equipment for the British army. ; Shelling of Madras by SMS Emden On 22 September 1914, the German cruiser Emden which was patrolling the Bay of Bengal launched a surprise attack on Madras shelling the oil tanks of the Burmah Oil Company that we set up on the shore. Five tanks were hit out of which two caught fire. Nearly, 425,000 gallons of oil were lost in the attack. Three Indians were killed and the Indian liner Chupra was damaged in the attack. The battle lasted fifteen minutes and Emden sailed away towards Pondicherry when the coastal defenses of Madras started to retaliate. Though the casualties due to the attack were minimal, there was a great deal of material damage caused by the shelling. The people of Madras were terrified by these attacks that SMS Emden has carved out a place for itself in local folklore. ; Home Rule Movement In 1915, the Home Rule Movement was started in order to demand home rule for India. In Madras, it was led by Irishwoman Annie Besant and Sir S. Subramania Iyer. As the movement gathered strength, Pentland responded with Annie Besant's arrest in June 1917 for hoisting the provisional flag of free India and a crackdown on the leaders of the movement. Other freedom-fighter as George Arundale and B. P. Wadia were subsequently arrested. These arrests were strongly condemned and her case argued by Mohammad Ali Jinnah. =Pentland and Rameswaram= Lord and Lady Pentland were deeply interested in Hindu religion and philosophy. He appeared captivated by the Hindu shrine at Rameswaram which he visited during the inauguration of Pamban Bridge and recommended to the Viceroy to establish a committee to conduct a detailed undersea exploration at the site. =Pentland's policy= Pentland was one of the classical British Indian politicians who shared their views on appeasing Indians and that words were more important than actions. The half-measures at industrial development were primarily undertaken to sustain the wartime economy of the First World War. In 1917, he is believed to have told Edwin Samuel Montagu, the Secretary of State for India: Lord Pentland is also remembered for having assisted the Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan make his journey to England. On the general poverty of the masses, Pentland remarked that laborers of Madras city had the habit of frequenting cinema halls to watch movies and suggested that this could be one of the possible reasons for their poverty. Pentland's statement also hints at the possibility of a drastic increase in the number of cinema goers during his Governorate. Death the modest grave of John Sinclair, Baron Pentland, Dean Cemetery John Sinclair died in 1925, and was succeeded to the barony by his son. He is buried in Dean Cemetery in Edinburgh, with a humble grave, set back from the path behind other stones. It lies in the north-west section of the original cemetery. Honours Pentland was made a Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire in 1912 and a Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India in 1918.

They are mentioned in both Beowulf and in Widsith, where they are in conflict with the Danes. However, in the Norse tradition the Hea√∞obards had apparently been forgotten and the conflict is instead rendered as a family feud,The Relation of the Hrolfs Saga Kraka and the Bjarkarimur to Beowulf by Olson, 1916, at Project Gutenberg or as a conflict with the Saxons, where the Danes take the place of the Hea√∞obards.The article Starkad in Nordisk familjebok (1909).

Widsith  Whereas Beowulf never dwells on the outcome of the battle with Ingeld, the possibly older poem Widsith refers to Hro√∞gar and Hro√∞ulf defeating the Hea√∞obards at Heorot:Lines 45‚Äì59. {  :Hro√æwulf ond Hro√∞gar heoldon lengest :sibbe √¶tsomne suhtorf√¶dran, :si√æ√æan hy forwr√¶con wicinga cynn :ond Ingeldes ord forbigdan,'' :forheowan √¶t Heorote Hea√∞obeardna √ærym.  :Hro√∞ulf and Hro√∞gar held the longest :peace together, uncle and nephew, :since they repulsed the Viking-kin :hewn at Heorot Hea√∞obards' fame. :and Ingeld to the spear-point made bow,  } References Category:Early Germanic peoples Category:English heroic legends Category:Migration Period ","title":"Hea√∞obards"},{"id":"2158372","text":"Nene Washes is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest on the bank of the River Nene east of Peterborough in Cambridgeshire.

This is described by Natural England as one of Britain's few remaining areas of washland which are vital for the survival of wildfowl and waders. It is used as a flood storage reservoir for the River Nene and is flooded for most of the winter and is pasure in the summer. It is important for birds all year. In the wintering wildfowl include wigeons, teals, pintails and Bewick's swans. In the breeding season the nesting species include common crane, black-tailed godwit, garganey and common snipe. The cranes also winter in the area and flock in nearby fields. They reserve is also good for birds of prey including Western marsh harrier, Eurasian hobby and short-eared owl. The rich flora in ditches include uncommon species such as frogbit, water violet and flowering rush. There is also an important population of spined loach in the drainage channels in and around the washes, and the presence of this species is one of the primary reasons for the site's designation as a Special Area of Conservation.

The games can be copied to the hard drive from within the program, or by using a computer with image dumping software that outputs to a specific custom format. The HD Loader software does not require an original Sony hard drive to function properly, however some drives may be impossible to attach without modifying connectors. Games may also refuse to detect the drive if it is unofficial. Reaction Sony's public stance on HD Loader is that it is not supported and is illegal (it can enable game piracy by allowing games to be installed, then played later without owning the disc). In October, 2006, a federal court in California ordered defendants to pay in excess of $9 million in damages for Digital Millennium Copyright Act violations for selling HD Loader. A clone of the patched version of the official version is being sold as HD Advance, is still being manufactured and can be purchased from many online retailers. Compatibility HD Loader is not 100% compatible with all PS2 games. Some incompatibilities exist because game software depends on certain peculiarities of the PS2 drive hardware. Additional incompatibilities arise from the use of dual-layer DVDs in some PS2 games, which are sometimes not parsed properly by HD Loader (incidentally, dual-layer games can only be installed from a PC but as of 0.8c it's possible to install them from HD Loader). Finally, there are intentional impediments introduced by some recent high-profile PS2 titles, such as God of War and Gran Turismo 4, to prevent them from being executed off the hard drive. In response to the limitations of HD Loader, a number of independent programmers have developed patches which extend the functionality of HD Loader to improve game compatibility or different software entirely (e.g., OpenPS2Loader). These include a fix to improve dual-layer support, one to implement a non-aligned data buffer (which allows Gradius V to be played from the HD), one to defeat newer copy-protection measures (popularly known as the God of War fix), one to support the new \\"slimline\\" SCPH-70000 series PlayStation 2 hardware and one to implement 48-bit Logical Block Addressing (which allows HD Loader to take full advantage of hard drives larger than 137 GB; or 128 GiB, as reported by HD Loader) as of 0.7c hard drives of up to 2 Terabytes can be used. These unofficial patches have been accumulated into the HD Loader release known as 0.8b, The unofficial HD Loader is currently at version 0.8c as of April 2007. Version 0.8c continues support for 48-bit (up to 2 Terabyte hard drives), patches for Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories and God of War II, 3 more modes and support for installing and running dual layer games directly off the hard drive. Some games need to be patched in order to be played with HD Loader. Another may require using tricks, such as starting the game with an older, digital controller and then switching to DualShock 2, or refuse to install. According to PS2HD.COM, the compatibility rate of patched HD Loader is around 88.2%. Original Playstation games are not compatible with this method. Version history Official HD Loader is extracted and released to the internet as a retaliation to the free library files used in its creation. 0.6d - the first unofficial version that improved game compatibility. 0.7c - fix for Suikoden V, patches for 48bit HDDs (up to 2 Terabytes), DMA modes (UDMA/MDMA) and DVD9 fix to allow dual layer games to be played were added. A stable GUI Patching app was created and allowed one to choose which patches and other various edits to apply to an Official unpatched version. Updated compatibility menu added. 0.7e - patches that fixed Shadow of the Colossus and Super Monkey Ball were added. This version enabled playing many previously incompatible games. Updated compatibility menu and changed modes description. 0.8 - A patch that fixed GTA: Liberty City Stories and the ability to edit the DMA button configuration. 0.8b - fixes a bug with HDL0.8 not installing to HDDs over 128 GB and a few other minor errors. Updated compatibility menu. 0.8b+ - A patch that fixed God of War II was added. This version is known under different names because author did not rename the version. Additionally, this patch breaks support for Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories. 0.8c - A fix for the buffer alignment was added into the GUI Patcher app and made both GOW2 and GTA:LCS run without crashing. This is the current version. The unofficial releases can be run on a console with a modchip installed, or by using an exploit such as Free McBoot or PS2 Independence Exploit. =HD Advance= HD Advance is a cloned version of the HD Loader software for the PlayStation 2, which allow users to play games installed to the optional hard drive peripheral available for the PS2. HD Advance is identical in functionality to many patched versions of HD Loader freely available online (that include DVD-9 support and 48-bit hard drive addressing) - only with a different theme and some changed text strings. The only benefit of HD Advance is that it is distributed on a pressed disk, giving a patched version of HD Loader that can run on a console without a modchip installed, and also without the need of the PS2 Independence Exploit or any other software modification. However, players who were using HD Advance 2.0 retail pressed discs (CD or DVD) to format a Maxtor hard disk with 80 GB capacity and subsequently use the disc to play PS2 games from the HDD were reported experiencing a strange problem. HD Loader versions up to 0.7c boot up perfectly via the Independence Exploit but subsequent versions of HD Loader from 0.8 onwards freezes on the splash screen and refuses to start up if formatted with a HD Advance disc. This is possibly due to newer patches that are not in any HD Advance discs;a solution is to reformat the hard disk with HD Loader version 0.8 or higher, which is recommended for newer PS2 games. However, this is not confirmed to work 100% across the board as certain PS2 models (mainly PAL 7xxx consoles) was reported to still freeze at splash screen; a currently-unfixable problem related to HD Loader version 0.8 or higher on PAL single-port network adapter models was the main problem. =Open PS2 Loader= Open PS2 Loader, abbreviated as OPL, is an open-source program that allows playing of commercial games and homebrew installed from external storage devices. . It has support for the Hard Disk Drive (like HD Loader), USB (like HD Advance), and SMB (over network). It also has additional features, like the GSM feature that is used to disable videos and change the resolution of the game output, virtual memory cards (allowing you to save on USB, HDD, or SMB), usage of the DualShock3 controller over USB and Bluetooth (using a dongle) and a cheat engine. The interface of Open PS2 Loader can be customized with themes. It has been developed in version control since September 27, 2009.

It lies in a valley of Cserh√°t Mountains, surrounded by low peaks. The natural environment is protected.  History  In the middle of the 13th century, in the aftermath of the Mongol invasion, construction of Holl√≥k≈ë castle first began as a means to protect the area against future attacks. At this time, the area around Holl√≥k≈ë was held by the Kacsics noble clan. The castle was first mentioned in records in 1310. The original village was built just below the castle walls. The Ottomans captured the castle in 1552 and for the next 150 years, control alternated between Ottoman and Hungarian forces. At the end of the Ottoman era (1683) the castle and the village were finally abandoned and the present village grew up below. Many of the existing houses were first built around this time. The houses, which contain wood in their structure, have had to be rebuilt many times throughout the years due to periodic fires, the last being in 1909.

History Mina was founded as a railroad town in 1905 and was named for Ferminia Sarras, a large landowner and famed prospector known as the 'Copper Queen.' The Carson and Colorado Railway, a division of Southern Pacific Railroad, had a station in the town. The railroad is long gone, but at one time a local shuttle called the \\"Slim Princess\\" allowed Native Americans to ride free of charge atop the railcars, and passengers and crew would shoot wild game from open windows. The train moved slowly enough that hunters were able to retrieve their game and reboard.

Gee Jon, a 29-year-old member of the Hop Sing Tong, became the first person to be executed by lethal gas. The execution was at the Nevada State Prison on February 8, 1924. =Name= Some sources states that the name is derived from the Spanish word meaning 'mine.' Other sources state that John C. Fulton (or John M. Fulton), division general manager for the Southern Pacific Railway, named the town after Fermina Sarras (or Serrias), a Nicaraguan woman who was operating nearby copper prospects. Initially a railroad station was intended to be at Sodaville, but agreement between the railroad and land speculators could not be reached, so Mina, Nevada was platted two miles north of Sodaville.

By accepting an argument, they directly give access to functions of web sites, as opposed to filling web forms at the respective web site for accessing these functions. Smart bookmarks can be used for web searches, or access to data on web sites with uniformly structured web addresses (e.g., user profiles in a web forum). Smart bookmarks first were introduced in OmniWeb on the NEXTSTEP platform in 1997/1998, where they were called shortcuts. The feature was subsequently taken up by Opera, Galeon and Internet Explorer for Mac, so they can now be used in many web browsers, most of which are Mozilla based, like Kazehakase and Mozilla Firefox. In Web, smart bookmarks appear in a dropdown menu when entering text in the address bar. By selecting a smart bookmark the respective web site is accessed using the text as argument. Smart bookmarks can also be added to the toolbar, together with their own textbox. The same applies to Galeon, which also allows the user to collapse and expand the textboxes within the toolbar. Smart bookmarks can also be shared, and there is a collection of them at the web site of the Galeon project.  Usage  There are two ways to employ smart bookmarks: either through the assignment of keywords or without. E.g., Mozilla derivatives and also Konqueror requires the assigning of keywords that can then be typed directly into the address bar followed by the term. Epiphany does not allow assigning keywords. Instead, the term is typed directly into the address bar, then all smart bookmarks appear on the address bar, can be dropped down the list, and selected.

He was commandant of the convict settlement at Norfolk Island for a period in 1839. He later served in New Zealand and British India. Biography Born on 19 May 1791 in Gibraltar, Bunbury was educated in England. He joined the 90th Regiment in 1807 and fought in the Peninsular War during which he was wounded. After the war, he considered becoming an artist, spending time in Paris. In 1822, he joined the 80th Regiment, based in Malta. In 1825, he transferred to the 85th Regiment of Foot for a period of service in Spain before returning to the 80th Regiment, with which he later served in England. In 1837, Bunbury was sent to Australia and in due course the Governor of New South Wales, George Gipps, ordered him take command of the garrison and convict settlement at Norfolk Island. He was commandant at Norfolk Island from April to July 1839. As commandant, he was confident in his ability to manage the hardened convicts under his command. He wrote that he could not understand why \\"a villain who has been guilty of every enormity, should feel shame at having his back scratched with the cat-o-nine- tails when he felt none for his atrocious crimes.\\" He also claimed that \\"if a man is too sick to work he is too sick to eat\\" and claimed that the queue at the hospital was halved. Although his punishments were harsh, he replaced hand hoeing with ploughs, rewarded good behaviour with improved jobs and gave older convicts lighter work. He earned the ire of the soldiers on the island by ordering the destruction of huts built on the small gardens they kept for their own use and for trafficking with the convicts. The soldiers mutinied, a warship was sent to restore peace and Bunbury was recalled in July 1839. In 1840, after William Hobson, Lieutenant-Governor of New Zealand, suffered a stroke, Bunbury was sent by Gipps to New Zealand with instructions to take over as Lieutenant-Governor if Hobson was incapacitated, but he had recovered. Bunbury took the Treaty of Waitangi to the South Island on HMS Herald and took possession of the island. He was made a magistrate in 1841 and acted as Deputy Governor in January 1844. Later in 1844 he was sent to India. While in transit to Calcutta, his ship was wrecked on the Andaman Islands. For his leadership of the 600 odd survivors until they were rescued, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath. He later served in the First Anglo-Sikh War and was present at most of the major battles of the campaign in India, including the Battle of Sobraon. Bunbury retired from the British Army on 31 December 1849 with the rank of lieutenant-colonel and returned to England, marrying soon after his arrival in the country. He wrote his memoirs which were published in 1861. He died early the following year.

It was released as the third single from the album in October 2001. It peaked at number 18 on the UK Singles Chart. The song features a horn section loop sampled from \\"Modesty Blaise\\", a piece by British jazz musician John Dankworth. Rapper Del tha Funkee Homosapien is the only artist to provide vocals for the song. Music video The music video for \\"Rock the House\\" was directed by Jamie Hewlett and Pete Candeland. The inspiration for the video is said to have come from Hewlett's angst at the time, as the band was going through the process of being sued by another band named Doppelgangerz, who claimed that Gorillaz was a stolen idea. It starts with a shot of the gate of Kong Studios. The camera then follows Noodle on a tricycle through the hallways of the building. It leads past a door to a room where Gorillaz are performing. A white mist appears among them and Russel passes out. Then the floor has turned into the ghost of Del, who rises up and throws the Gorillaz to the ground. Del is outfitted with protective gear including a helmet. In Rise of the Ogre it explains he is dressed as Mr. Freedom. Del takes a few steps when from behind him a series of spring-loaded guns shoot billiard balls at him, but he diverts them with his glove. A series of inflatable female gorillas appear and start to do cheerleading. 2-D is dodging the balls being shot at him by doing dance moves, but then he is hit by a few balls and knocked out. Murdoc then begins to divert the balls with a padded jockstrap he is wearing, hitting them away with his pelvic thrusts. He is successful a dozen times until a ball ricochets off the padded wall and hits his unprotected buttocks. The ball ricochets and hits Russel in the head, waking him up and making Del disappear. Russel looks around, noticing 2-D laying on the floor, Murdoc is standing bowlegged, and Noodle smiling and holding her guitar. The final shot is simply the introduction, but reversed.

Murdoc is stunned by this and repeats his disbelief briefly during the section on the video. Though the track was selected for a single and received generally good reactions, Rise of the Ogre claims that Gorillaz were never particularly satisfied with \\"Rock the House\\", with Murdoc expressing his opinions by claiming he \\"won this song in a raffle\\" and 2-D thinking that the track should not have made it on the album at all. For the radio edit of the song, the line which features the words \\"Shake your ass-crack\\" is cut. Instead, the edit features the orchestral type sound, which features after the trumpet riff at the start of the song, so that the last two words are not heard.

The group formed as part of the same 1960s Texas psychedelic scene in which the Thirteenth Floor Elevators formed. While studying art at the University of St. Thomas, the members signed with independent label International Artists. Their confrontational, experimental approach employed noise and \\"free-form freak-outs\\", presaging the development of industrial rock and winning them a small cult following. The Red Crayola disbanded in the late 1960s, but were resurrected in the late 1970s when Thompson moved to England and found favor in the post-punk scene. Thompson has continued using the name, in its legally altered spelling for performances or releases in the USA, for his musical projects since. The group has released recordings on European labels such as Rough Trade and Recommended. In the mid-1990s, Thompson returned to the United States, signing with Drag City and releasing further albums. History =1960s= In 1966, the band signed to International Artists, home label to fellow psych-rockers The 13th Floor Elevators, which was run by Lelan Rogers (brother of country musician Kenny Rogers). In 1967, the label released the psychedelic album Parable of Arable Land, featuring six songs by the original three members interwoven with a cacophony generated by approximately 50 anonymous followers known as The Familiar Ugly, who appear on a number of noise tracks called Free-Form Freak-Outs. 13th Floor Elevators frontman Roky Erickson also makes guest appearances on \\"Hurricane Fighter Plane\\" (playing organ) and \\"Transparent Radiation\\" (on harmonica). The album's title track was a tape loop of electronic sounds with musical improvisations layered on top of it; a sound that foreshadowed the Red Krayola's second recording. The album Coconut Hotel was recorded in 1967 but rejected by International Artists for its lack of commercial potential. It departed completely from the full-sounding guitar/bass/drums/vocals rock sound of the Red Krayola's first album. Coconut Hotel featured such self-described tracks as \\"Organ Buildup\\", \\"Free Guitar\\" and a series of atonal \\"One-Second Pieces\\" for piano, trumpet and percussion. The album did not see release until 1995. During this period, the band performed a concert in Berkeley, California, where they attached a contact microphone to a sheet of aluminium foil that was set under a block of melting ice; this performance is captured on Live 1967. The Red Krayola also performed with guitarist John Fahey and recorded an entire studio album of music in collaboration with him, but label head Lelan Rogers demanded possession of the tapes, and recorded documentation of those sessions has been missing ever since. The band's second album to see release (and the first to be released with the new \\"Krayola\\" spelling) was 1968's God Bless the Red Krayola and All Who Sail With It. God Bless presented a middle ground between Parable of Arable Land and Coconut Hotel, having veered away from the cacophonous psychedelic approach of their first album, but performing short, minimalist songs on electric guitar, bass and drums (interspersed with occasional a cappella harmonies and piano interludes) to achieve some surprisingly melodic results and even more surprisingly off-kilter lyrics. Hints of the as yet unheard music on Coconut Hotel also revealed themselves (the track \\"Listen to This\\" is a one-second piece with spoken introduction, and \\"Free Piece\\" sounds like an outtake from Coconut Hotel). The album was not as well received as the band's first release and the Red Krayola's original lineup disbanded. Studio demos by the original Red Crayola were released on the 1980 compilation of International Artists rarities, Epitaph for a Legend. In 1969, Thompson recorded a solo album called Corky's Debt to His Father for a small label called Texas Revolution. =1970s‚Äì1980s= Mayo Thompson continued to make music, both under his own name and as The Red Crayola (reverting to the original name in Europe). The next incarnation of the group was a duo: Thompson and American drummer Jesse Chamberlain. The two recorded the single \\"Wives in Orbit\\" and the album Soldier Talk, both of which could be seen as musical responses to punk rock. Radar Records reissued Parable of Arable Land in 1978 in the UK, accompanied by a flexi-disc, on which was an up-tempo version of Hurricane Fighter Plane recorded in July 1978, with an apparent punk rock influence as well. His collaborations in the 1970s and 1980s read like a roll-call of the avant-garde and experimental artists and musicians of the era. The Red Crayola teamed up with the British-American conceptual art collective Art & Language,John Walker. (1987). \\"Art-Language & Red Crayola\\" . In Cross-Overs: Art into Pop, Pop into Art.

(also featuring The Raincoats' Gina Birch, Lora Logic of Essential Logic and Swell Maps' Epic Soundtracks) and 1983's Black Snakes. Thompson joined Pere Ubu for a period in the early 1980s, performing on their albums The Art of Walking and Song of the Bailing Man, and provided soundtrack music for Derek Jarman. Throughout this time he was prolific as a producer for many other seminal experimental and alternative rock acts, including The Fall (1980's Grotesque (After the Gramme)), The Raincoats, Scritti Politti, Blue Orchids, Cabaret Voltaire, Stiff Little Fingers, Kleenex/LiLiPUT, The Chills and Primal Scream. =1990s‚Äìpresent= The 1990s found The Red Krayola with a new audience, who came to the group via musicians associated with Chicago's post-rock scene and in particular the Drag City label, who had joined the band's ever-shifting line-up for a number of releases including the LPs The Red Krayola (1994), Hazel (1996), and Fingerpainting (1999). These were, among others, Jim O'Rourke and David Grubbs of Gastr del Sol, the post-conceptual visual artist Stephen Prina, German painter Albert Oehlen, George Hurley (formerly of Minutemen and Firehose), Tom Watson of Slovenly, Sandy Yang, Elisa Randazzo and John McEntire of Tortoise. In 2006, the group issued an album, Introduction, and an EP, Red Gold. In 1995, Drag City released 1967's Coconut Hotel LP and in 1998 issued The Red Krayola Live 1967 with material from the Angry Arts Festival and Berkeley Folk Music Festival including their live collaboration with John Fahey. In 2007, Drag City released Sighs Trapped by Liars, another collaboration of Red Krayola with Art & Language, followed in 2010 with another, Five American Portraits, which consists of musical portraits of Wile E. Coyote, President George W Bush, President Jimmy Carter, John Wayne, and Ad Reinhardt, with vocals by Gina Birch. In 2016 came Baby and Child Care, recorded in 1984. Covers Pere Ubu covered \\"Horses,\\" a track from Mayo Thompson's solo album Corky's Debt to His Father, on 1980s The Art of Walking, while Thompson was a member. Houston, Texas hardcore punk band Really Red recorded a cover of \\"War Sucks\\" for their 1984 Rest in Pain LP and followed it with a soundscape piece entitled \\"Just the Facts Ma'am\\", which is an obvious tribute to the free-form freakouts on \\"Parable of Arable Land\\". British space rock group Spacemen 3 recorded a version of \\"Transparent Radiation\\" from the Red Krayola's Parable of Arable Land, and the same album's lead track \\"Hurricane Fighter Plane\\" was covered by Nik Turner's post-Hawkwind outfit Inner City Unit, UK Goth rock legends Alien Sex Fiend in 1986 and by Scottish act Future Pilot AKA in 1996, as well as by ultra-violent punkrockers The Dwarves (who were originally a psychedelic garage band). Also covering \\"Hurricane Fighter Plane\\" was New Zealand post-punk band The Pin Group, led by future solo performer Roy Montgomery. Boston-based indie outfit Galaxie 500 covered \\"Victory Garden\\" from the Red Krayola's second album on their own second album On Fire. In April 2009, Spectrum, fronted by ex-Spacemen 3 frontman Peter Kember, released an EP named for and headlined by a cover of \\"War Sucks\\".

The monument commemorates the Battle of Bennington during the American Revolutionary War. In that battle, on 16 August 1777, Brigadier General John Stark and 1,400 New Hampshire men, aided by Colonels Warner and Herrick of Vermont, Simonds of Massachusetts, and Moses Nichols of New Hampshire, defeated two detachments of General John Burgoyne's British army, who were seeking to capture a store of weapons and food maintained where the monument now stands. While the battle is termed the Battle of Bennington, it actually occurred about away, in Walloomsac, New York; the Bennington Battlefield, a U.S. National Historic Landmark, is entirely within the state of New York. In 1877, a local historical society began to plan a monument for the battle's centenary, and considered many designs. One which called for a slender stone column only tall was showcased during the battle's centennial celebration, which was attended by President Rutherford B. Hayes. The committee eventually accepted J. Phillip Rinn's design with some changes. The monument's cornerstone was laid in 1887, and it was completed in November 1889 at a total cost of $112,000 (including the site). It is constructed of Sandy Hill Dolomite from present day Hudson Falls, New York, a blue-gray magnesian limestone containing numerous fossils. Dedication ceremonies were delayed until 1891, when President Benjamin Harrison attended the ceremonies and held a reception at the nearby Walloomsac Inn. Today the Bennington Battle Monument is a Vermont State Historic Site. From its observatory level at , which can be reached by elevator (but not the stairs, which are closed), one can see Vermont along with the other U.S. states of Massachusetts and New York. A kettle captured from General Burgoyne's camp at Saratoga is visible in the monument along with a diorama of the second engagement, and information on how the monument was built. Statues of John Stark (\\"Live free or die\\"), Seth Warner, and other notables ornament the grounds. The monument, while from the relevant battlefield, is located very close to what was once the site of the Catamount Tavern, where Ethan Allen and the Green Mountain Boys planned the capture of Fort Ticonderoga in 1775.

A follow up to their 1974 book All the President's Men, The Final Days concerns itself with the final months of the Presidency of Richard Nixon including battles over the Nixon White House tapes and the impeachment process against Richard Nixon. Background and writing Not long after the resignation of Richard Nixon in August 1974, Woodward and Bernstein took a leave of absence from The Washington Post in order to begin work on the book. They originally intended to cover just the last hundred days of the Nixon presidency but then expanded it further back. They hired two research assistants, Scott Armstrong and Al Kamen, and among them they interviewed 394 people involved in the tale. People were anxious to talk in an effort to get their (sometimes self-serving) perspective on the events included in the narrative, and almost all of the sources were promised anonymity in return. In this way, Woodward and Bernstein constructed a fly on the wall type narrative of the events in question.Marshall, Watergate's Legacy and the Press, p. 114. While the book was being written, there were some intimations that it was going to be a \\"blockbuster\\" in terms of content, but Woodward demurred, saying instead that it would be \\"a book of a hundred small surprises.\\" According to Jon Marshall's 2011 retrospective look at Watergate and the press, although Bernstein got co-equal credit on the cover, he in fact did relatively few interviews and not only less of the writing than Woodward, but also less than either Armstrong or Kamen.Marshall, Watergate's Legacy and the Press, p. 240n. (It could also be noted that Woodward wrote the foreword to Marshall's book.) As noted in the book's foreword, all the information and scenarios depicted were taken from interviews with 394 people who were involved. The content of the interviews was considered on the record, but the identity of the sources remained confidential. Every detail was thoroughly checked, and any information that could not be confirmed by two separate accounts was left out of the book. In an example of the book's approach, J. Fred Buzhardt co-operated with Woodward and Bernstein during the research for the book, by sitting for eight \\"extensive\\" interviews. One person was interviewed as many as 17 times. Promotion and the Newsweek excerpts Release of the book was preceded by the publishing of excerpts in Newsweek magazine, which included a number of the authors' more vivid narrations. (At the time, Newsweek was owned by The Washington Post Company.) At the same time, revelations from these excerpts appeared in many newspaper stories. Two revelations that caught the most attention regarded Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. One was the disparaging comments about Nixon that Kissinger supposedly made to his staff, such as a reference to \\"our meatball President.\\" The other, which received even more attention, was a memorable August 7, night-before-resignation-announcement scene with the president, in which a sobbing Nixon asked Kissinger to kneel and pray with him in the Lincoln Sitting Room, with Nixon ending up curled on the floor, beating the carpet with his fist whilst bemoaning his fate. The sensational nature of some of the excerpts brought significant criticism. Other items revealed by the excerpts included Nixon's deteriorating mental state, fears among his sons-in-law that he posed a possible danger to himself, Nixon's strong strain of anti-Semitism, and that the president and First Lady Pat Nixon were estranged and had been for some time. The promotion was effective: this issue of Newsweek became the fastest selling one in the magazine's history. The debate over these particular incidents colored much of the subsequent reaction to the book. Content The book contains two parts, with twenty chapters. The first carries on from where All the President's Men leaves off, in particular from April 30, 1973, when John Dean, the White House counsel, was fired, and brings the narrative through developments of later in 1973 and then up to late July 1974. Part II consists of a day-by-day account of the title-referenced final days, beginning with \\"Wednesday, July 24\\" and continuing through \\"Friday, August 9\\". There is also a Cast of Characters at the beginning, starting at Robert Abplanalp and finishing with Ronald L. Ziegler, and a Chronology at the end, running from November 5, 1968 through August 9, 1974. Both are intended to help the reader keep the complex chain of events and people in mind. As published by Simon & Schuster, the book contained some photographic illustrations and cost $10.95. After it became the fastest selling book in the publisher's history, the price was raised to $11.95, supposedly to defray paper costs and, in the publisher's words, as part of \\"maintaining priority press time so that [it] can get on press before other books.\\" Critical response Reviews of the book focused both on the disclosures within it and the methods by which it was written. Regarding the first, the Los Angeles Times said the book was \\"Fascinating, macabre, mordant, melancholy, frightening....\\" Newsweek, which ran the excerpts, described it as \\"An extraordinary work of reportage on the epic political story of our time.\\" The book as a whole gave a more balanced, at times sympathetic, portrait of Nixon. The New York Times daily review by Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said that the book was \\"Unprecedented...[Nixon] emerges from the book as a tragic figure weathering a catastrophic ordeal (of his own making, to be sure, but that is the nature of truly tragic ordeals), and weathering it with considerable courage and dignity.\\" This fuller depiction did much to ameliorate the initial denunciations of the book. Making reference to the debate swirling around the book, the Times wrote: In a perspective from The New York Times Book Review, author Richard Reeves said that the book \\"is a spectacular piece of reporting, with all the delights and limitations of journalism.\\"http://article.archive.nytimes.com/1976/04/18/357307982.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJBTN455PTTBQQNRQ&Expires;=1486737795&Signature;=3w9aGRupaaMIeweln1sB%2BgY%2FKeE%3D Reeves also expressed concern over the sourcing matter, saying that they should have gotten some of their sources to go on record. All the same he concluded, \\"Hell, I trust Woodward and Bernstein,\\" saying \\"not only are they great reporters,\\" but that some of his own findings in researching the first days of the Presidency of Gerald R. Ford had confirmed some of their reporting regarding the last days of the Nixon one. In a look back from three decades later, The Guardian called the book \\"a meticulous recreation of the last hundred days of the Nixon presidency.\\" In a 2018 retrospective ranking by Politico of all of Woodward's 20 books, including his newly released Fear, the ranking of The Final Days was second best, trailing only All the President's Men.\\"I Read Every Bob Woodward Book. Here‚Äôs How They Stack Up\\", Chris Suellentrop, Politico, September 7, 2018 The Politico writer said of The Final Days that \\"This book ... is fantastic, the model for all [by Woodward] that came after.\\" Still, the manner of sources for the book remained a subject for debate as well. Commercial response The book was a major commercial success. It became Simon & Schuster's fastest selling book, surpassing by half again the rate of the publisher's previous fastest, 1960's The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. It debuted atop The New York Times best seller list for the week of April 25, 1976.First week, at no. 1: http://www.hawes.com/1976/1976-04-25.pdf It stayed in the top spot for 18 weeks,First week not at no. 1: http://www.hawes.com/1976/1976-08-29.pdf and on the full list for 29 weeks total.Last entry: http://www.hawes.com/1976/1976-11-07.pdf Altogether The Final Days sold some 630,000 copies in hardcover.Michael Schudson, Watergate in American Memory: How We Remember, Forget, and Reconstruct the Past (Basic Books, 1993), p. 133. Paperback rights to the book were in April 1976 sold to Avon Books in a record-setting deal for $1.55 million, eclipsing a previous mark for any publisher for non-fiction works held by The Joy of Cooking. At the same time, the paperback edition of All the President's Men was atop that bestseller list and the film All the President's Men was the biggest box-office success in the land.Jon Marshall, Watergate's Legacy and the Press: The Investigative Impulse (Evanston, Illinois: Northwestern University Press, 2011), p. 115. All of these successes made both authors wealthy. Legacy The book was the last collaboration between Woodward and Bernstein; quite dissimilar in personality, and with different approaches towards their newfound wealth, they soon went their separate ways. The pair did reunite in print for the first time three and a half decades later, for a Washington Post op-ed column in 2012. In it they said that subsequent archival evidence and other historical accounts indicated that in the words of the column's title, \\"Nixon was far worse than we thought.\\" Making reference to The Final Days, the pair said that their inclusion of anti-Semitic remarks and attitudes by Nixon in the book had been borne out by later revelations. The pair also sat for a joint retrospective '40 years later' interview on their Watergate reporting with CBS in 2014. In his 1978 memoir RN: The Memoirs of Richard Nixon, the former president gave an account of the famous night-before-resignation-announcement scene that presents it as shorter and more business-like, but allows that his sense of \\"agony\\" and \\"loss\\" became \\"most acute\\" for him that night.Nixon, Richard. RN: The Memoirs of Richard Nixon (New York: Grosset & Dunlap, 1978), pp. 1076‚Äì1077. Kissinger's 1982 memoir Years of Upheaval calls the Woodward and Bernstein narrative \\"an unfeeling account\\" but presents a description of the encounter that is not that far away from theirs.Kissinger, Henry. Years of Upheaval (Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1982), pp. 1207‚Äì1210, 1255n. Both Nixon and Kissinger have the encounter starting in the Lincoln Sitting Room but ending in the Lincoln Bedroom. In other media In 1989, a television adaptation of the book, also named The Final Days, aired. It starred Lane Smith as Nixon. It was nominated for five Primetime Emmy Awards and one Golden Globe Award. On Saturday Night Live there was a parody sketch with Dan Akroyd as Nixon and John Belushi as Kissinger.

The BDO was a founder member of the World Darts Federation which was formed in 1976 but following a WDF ruling in 2019 they became considered as an associate member.https://www.dartswdf.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/WDF-Letter-BDO-NON- SANCTIONING-.pdf The BDO went into liquidation in September 2020. The BDO was made up of 66 member counties in Britain and organised tournaments for semi- professionals and amateurs, including the first World Professional Darts Championship in 1978. In 1990 many of the top players came together and founded the World Darts Council (WDC). A few years later, WDC broke away completely from the BDO, rebranding as the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) in 1997 following legal action resulting in a Tomlin order. Over time more of the leading players left the BDO to join the more lucrative PDC. History The BDO set the rules which govern the game of darts, including the distance of the throwing oche (2.37m / 7 ft 9 ¬º inches) and the height and dimensions of the board. The BDO organised the first World Professional Darts Championship in 1978, known for many years as The Embassy due to its sponsorship by Imperial Tobacco. It was then known as the Lakeside World Professional Darts Championship, or Lakeside for short, and is now being played at a new venue, and is no longer recognised by the World Darts Federation. Split in darts After the World Championship began, televised darts became more prevalent with many major tournaments appearing on ITV and BBC. But by 1984, darts had lost many of its sponsors and only the World Championship remained on television. Some players became frustrated by the lack of opportunity to make a living professionally. A group of 19 players (including all previous World Champions who were still active in the game) created the World Darts Council (WDC), later the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) towards the end of 1990. They wanted more tournaments to be staged and to appoint a PR consultant to improve the image of the game. The 1993 Embassy World Championship was the last unified world darts championship. On 7 January 1993, the rebel players issued a joint statement affirming that they would only compete in the 1994 tournament if it was held under the auspices of the WDC. The BDO responded by banning the rebel players from all BDO tournaments. After a long legal battle, the BDO was forced to acknowledge the WDC's legitimacy and the right of players to choose which body they competed for. In return the WDC dropped its claim to being the sport's governing body and renamed itself the Professional Darts Corporation. Since the split Since there have been two World Championships from 1994 onwards, there have been calls for head-to-head matches between the two Winners. There have been two head-to-head matches between the reigning champions of the two organisations. The challenge matches, held in 1999 and 2004, were officially recognised as undisputed championship matches. In their respective matches, the incumbent BDO champions Raymond van Barneveld and Andy Fordham were defeated by the PDC champion Phil Taylor. The BDO board have continued to support players from the grassroots of the game since the \\"split\\", although there have been several high-profile players who have made a name within the organisation only to later join the PDC. Raymond van Barneveld's career in the BDO helped boost the popularity of the sport in his home country, the Netherlands. Dutch broadcaster SBS6 has broadcast the World Championship since 1998, and used to show two major BDO tournaments, the International Darts League and World Darts Trophy. Both no longer exist. However, the popularity of the sport has possibly contributed to the Netherlands making more star players, including the 2006 BDO World Champion, Jelle Klaasen, and the 2006 World Masters Champion, Michael van Gerwen. Exodus of players Due to the greater prize money available on the PDC tour, a growing number of BDO players have \\"defected\\" to the PDC. Four-time world champion Raymond van Barneveld was the highest profile switch, doing so in 2006. John Part (1997), Richie Burnett (2000), Steve Beaton (2001), Jelle Klaasen (2007), Mark Webster (2009), Ted Hankey (2012), Les Wallace (2013), Christian Kist (2014), Stephen Bunting (2014) and Glen Durrant (2019) are the other past BDO champions who subsequently switched to the PDC. BDO number 1 Robert Thornton decided to move to the PDC in May 2008. 2006 Winmau World Masters winner Michael van Gerwen switched without defending his title. Long time BDO player Mervyn King (who once claimed he would never play for the PDC) followed suit a month later. Gary Anderson and Webster were the top two ranked players when they signed with the PDC in January 2009. 2008 Lakeside runner-up Simon Whitlock also signed with the PDC in 2009. Very few players have moved the other way. 2004 Lakeside champion Andy Fordham moved to the PDC in 2009 and returned to the BDO in 2013. Three time BDO women's champion Anastasia Dobromyslova switched to the PDC in 2008, before returning in 2011. Ted Hankey, after switching to the PDC in 2012, returned to the BDO in 2014. Of recent though Andy Hamilton and Wes Newton began playing in BDO events at the start of 2018 after losing their PDC tour cards and both qualified for the 2019 BDO world championship. 2011 Annual General Meeting Prior to the 2011 Annual General Meeting of the BDO, many players and officials within the organisation had expressed increasing degrees of dissatisfaction with the performance of the existing Board of Directors. Particular areas of concern were the BDO's apparent stagnation in terms of creating new televised events and gaining new sponsors. An open letter was circulated to the various counties within the BDO structure, setting out the perceived issues, although the said letter was vague as to actual suggestions for improvement. Matters culminated at the subsequent AGM, where all but one of the incumbent Board were voted out of office (other than Dave Alderman who had already resigned), with only Vic Sexton retaining his seat. 2019 issues and WDF demotion There were a number of problems at the 2019 World Masters. Several seeded players opted not to participate in the event in protest at a change to qualifying criteria. Other players who did attend found they were unregistered, having been unaware of a new rule which required them to register in advance online. Due to the confusion, officials announced that there would be a redraw, which included fake names, apparently so they could be substituted if more real players arrived. Players were also not informed of the event's prizemoney in advance. Due to the issues at the World Masters, the World Darts Federation subsequently released a statement announcing that the BDO was to be demoted to \\"associate member\\" status and the WDF would no longer recognise BDO-organised tournaments. They cited the recent \\"breach of rules\\" and \\"draw changes during their competition\\", adding \\"we cannot be a part of or support such activities.\\" On 30 December 2019, five days before the start of the 2020 BDO World Championship, BDO chairman Des Jacklin announced that prizemoney for the upcoming event would have to be \\"reduced somewhat\\", although the BDO did not confirm what the new prize fund would be. He cited the failure to secure a sponsor for the event, and the fact that only 15% of tickets had been sold. The reduction in the prize fund and the failure to confirm the reduced amounts that players would receive was criticised by a number of players. In protest at the reduced prizemoney on offer, Fallon Sherrock, runner-up in the 2015 women's event, confirmed that she would be withdrawing from the competition. Ultimately, champion Wayne Warren received ¬£23,000, a 77% reduction on the previous year's prizemoney and the lowest amount received by a winner of the tournament since 1989. In September 2020, the company went into liquidation bringing an end to 47 years of history. Major tournaments BDO Events Ltd is the commercial arm of the BDO (British Darts Organisation) and was set up in 2013. The annual BDO Major events comprises the following British televised events: =World Professional Championship= The World Championship is the biggest of the tournaments, held at the Lakeside Country Club, Frimley Green, UK. The tournament started in 1978 and for the first 15 years it was a unified World Championship, before a separate competition (the PDC World Championship) began in 1994. There have been 24 different winners of the event and Eric Bristow is the player with the most BDO World titles including a hat-trick between 1984 and 1986. Raymond van Barneveld matched his overall haul of five world titles when he won the PDC version in 2007. Phil Taylor has also won the PDC title 14 times to bring his tally to 16 world titles. In December 2019 the World Darts Federation announced that it would no longer recognise the BDO as the ruling body of darts in the UK, no longer recognised the BDO World Championships and thus it no longer became a recognised world championship. In January 2020, the WDF assumed full responsibility for the running of the event and will be launching the tournament under the WDF banner. =World Masters= The World Masters is the longest running BDO major title, having started as far back as 1974. It is the second biggest major title on the BDO stage. Having been first staged in Fulham, the tournament has been to Wembley, Earls Court, Kensington, the Lakeside Country Club and others. It is currently held at the Circus Tavern in Purfleet. The tournament features shorter sets than the World Championship ‚Äì each set is the best of three legs instead of five at Lakeside. In the 40-year history of the event, only 7 players have managed to win the title on more than one occasion. Eric Bristow holds the record for most tournament wins with five. Bob Anderson and Martin Adams hold the record of winning the title three years running 86, 87, 88 for Anderson and 08, 09, 10 for Adams. Only 14 players have won both the Masters and World titles in their career. In January 2020, the WDF assumed full responsibility for the running of the event and will be launching the tournament under the WDF banner. =The BDO World Trophy= The BDO World Trophy is the Newest \\"Major\\" Darts tournament added to the BDO's events calendar from 2014 onwards, organized by the BDO Events ‚Äì the new commercial arm of the British Darts Organisation.. Current ranked tournaments Former televised tournaments =Topic International Darts League= The Topic International Darts League was a tournament staged in the Netherlands and formed the second leg of the Grand Slam having been introduced in 2003. Whilst its format has evolved in recent years, it features players competing in a round-robin tournament. The 2006 event featured 32 players in 8 groups of 4, which were then reduced to 4 further groups of 4. The top two in each group then went through to the knockout stages. When Raymond van Barneveld switched to the PDC in 2006, the tournament organisers agreed with the BDO to invite four players from the rival organisation. Van Barneveld (PDC) went on to win the title for the third time in 2006 and Gary Anderson (BDO) won the 2007 event. This remains the only major event to date that Phil Taylor hasn't won in either the BDO or PDC. =Bullit World Darts Trophy= The World Darts Trophy (WDT) was the third BDO major of the year and the second to be held in the Netherlands. Its straight knock-out format is comparable to the two versions of the World Championship. The WDT followed the International Darts League by inviting four PDC players to the tournament in 2006, and again a PDC player (Phil Taylor) won the title. =British Gold Cup= The British Gold Cup began in 1978 and was held in Stoke. It was broadcast on BBC until 1982, with the 1983 tournament blacked out due to a technician's strike. It was then broadcast in 2008 on Setanta Sports in the UK, After a brief stint on the short-lived channel Wire TV (94‚Äì95). Discontinued tournaments =British Professional Championship= The Unipart British Professional Championship was a tournament televised by the BBC between 1981 and 1988. After the 1988 championships, the BBC withdrew their coverage of the event and it left UK terrestrial television with only one televised tournament ‚Äì the World Championships. The game was at an all- time low and players eventually went on to set up the World Darts Council in an attempt to bring back sponsors and television. Jocky Wilson won the title a record four times ‚Äì John Lowe also reached four finals but lost them all. =British Matchplay= British Matchplay ran from 1976 to 1983 with a brief revival in 1986. The tournament was broadcast on the ITV network in 1978, but usually broadcast regionally including Anglia Television in 1977 and Central in 1986. =Bullseye Darts Championship= Not to be confused with the long- running game show Bullseye, this was a BBC2 tournament which ran for three years during the peak of darts boom period at the turn of the eighties. Jocky Wilson was twice the winner. =Butlins Grand Masters= ATV broadcast the Butlins Grand Masters between 1977 and 1988. Matches were played over the best of nine legs. The tournament was held at a pub in Birmingham. Bobby George was twice the winner and Eric Bristow won a hat-trick of titles. =World Matchplay= The MFI World Matchplay championship was short-lived but historic in darts as it featured the first ever televised nine-dart finish on 13 October 1984 when John Lowe won ¬£102,000 for the perfect game of darts against Keith Deller. Lowe went on to win the title that year. The tournament was broadcast on ITV and originally came from the Fulcrum Centre, Slough before switching to Festival Hall, Basildon. ITV ceased coverage after the 1988 championships and the tournament ended. ITV also pulled coverage of the World Masters after the 1988 event, leaving the BBC as the only broadcaster of darts until 1992. The PDC introduced a new version of World Matchplay in 1994.

Overall, her crews were awarded six clasps to the Naval General Service Medals, with two taking place in the French Revolutionary Wars, three during the Napoleonic Wars and the sixth in the War of 1812. Three of the clasps carried the name Phoebe. During her career, Phoebe sailed to the Mediterranean, the Baltic, the Indian Ocean, South East Asia, North America and South America. Once peace finally arrived, Phoebe was laid up, though she spent a few years as a slop ship during the 1820s. She was then hulked. The Admiralty finally sold her for breaking up in 1841. Construction She was one of four frigates that the Admiralty ordered on 24 May 1794 to a design by Sir John Henslow, Surveyor of the Navy, to be a faster version of the 1781 Perseverance class frigates. The contract for the first ship was placed with the Thames-side yard of John Dudman, where the keel was laid in June 1794.

Phoebe sighted the N√©r√©ide at 10am; the pursuit started at 11:30am and ended at 10:45pm with N√©r√©ide's surrender. During the chase N√©r√©ide fired her stern guns at Phoebe and the two vessels exchanged broadsides shortly before the N√©r√©ide surrendered. Phoebe lost three men killed and 10 wounded; N√©r√©ide lost 20 men killed and 55 wounded. Part of the reason for the disparity in casualties was that the ratio of the weight of the broadsides was 407 pounds to 268 pounds.James (1837), Vol.2, pp.92-93. In 1847, the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Phoebe 21 Decr. 1797\\" to all remaining members of her crew who had participated in the action. On 11 October 1799, Phoebe captured the French privateer Grand Ferrailleur. Grand Ferrailleur was armed with sixteen brass 6-pounder guns and had a crew of 121 men. She was 16 days from Bordeaux but had not taken any prizes. On 21 February 1800, Phoebe captured the French privateer Bellegarde (or Belle Garde) of Saint-Malo. Bellegarde carried 14 guns and a crew of 114 men. She had been out 16 days and had captured Chance, of London and sailing from Martinique, and the brig Friends, of Dartmouth, sailing from St. Michael's to Bristol. Later, on 24 February, recaptured Chance.The Naval chronicle, Volume 3, p.320. =Heureux= On 5 March, Phoebe captured the privateer Heureux in the English Channel off Bordeaux. Heureux had intended to cruise the West Indies. Instead, she arrived at Plymouth on 25 March. Heureux, of 22 long brass 12-pounders and 220 men, mistook Phoebe for an East Indiaman, and approached her. Heureux did not discover her mistake until she had arrived within point-blank musket-shot. Heureux fired on Phoebe in an \\"Act of Temerity to be regretted\\". Her hope was that well-directed fire would disable Phoebe's masts, rigging, and sails, and thereby enable Heureux to escape.James (1837), Vol. 3, pp.33-4. Phoebe returned fire and Heureux was forced to strike her colours. Phoebe had three seamen killed or mortally wounded, and three slightly wounded. Heureux had 18 men killed and 25 wounded, most of whom lost limbs. She had been out 42 days but had captured only a small Portuguese sloop that the wind had pushed out to sea while the sloop was sailing from Limerick to Galway with a cargo of wine. Barlow described Heureux as \\"the most complete flush Deck Ship I have ever seen, coppered, Copper fastened, highly finished and of large Dimensions... The Accounts given of her Sailing are very extraordinary; she will be considered as a most desirable Ship for His Majesty's Service.\\" The British took her into service as . =Africaine= On 19 February 1801, about six miles east of Gibraltar, Phoebe sighted a French ship off Ceuta, also sailing eastwards. Barlow chased the French vessel for two-and-a-half hours before he could bring her to a close action. After about two hours the French vessel struck her colours; she had five feet of water in her hold and was almost a wreck. Phoebes fire had dismounted her guns and left her decks strewn with hundreds of casualties. She proved to be Africaine, of twenty-six 18-pounders and eighteen 9-pounders; she had sailed from Rochefort on the 13th. She was under the command of Capitaine Majendie and she flew the broad pennant of Commandant de Division Saunier. She had a crew of 315 men, but also was ferrying 400 troops under General Desfourneaux to reinforce the French invasion force in Egypt. The French reported that they had suffered 200 killed in the action, including Saunier, the Chef de Brigade and two army captains, and 143 wounded, the later including Desfourneaux and Majendie, who was wounded in two places. The heavy casualties were the result of French troops crowding the upper deck despite their small arms fire contributing little or nothing in the dark to her defense. The troops had refused shelter below deck on the basis of mistaken valour.James (1837), Vol. 3, pp.139-41. Phoebe lost one man killed, and 12 men wounded. Her masts, sails and rigging were badly damaged but she was able to limp to Port Mahon. Weak winds resulted in the voyage, in company with Africaine, taking two weeks. The British took Africaine into service under her existing name. Barlow received a knighthood. Phoebes first lieutenant, John Wentworth Holland, who had been wounded, received a promotion to commander. In 1847 the action earned Phoebe's crew the clasp \\"Phoebe 19 Feby. 1801\\" to the Naval General Service Medal (1847). Captain Thomas Baker subsequently took command of Phoebe in May 1801. Napoleonic Wars In June 1802 Capt. James Shephard took command. Captain The Hon. Thomas Bladen Capell followed him and recommissioned Phoebe in September. She then sailed for the Mediterranean on 28 September. In 1803 Phoebe was sailing out of Malta. At some point, perhaps during the summer, her boats participated in a disastrous attack on two French privateers off Civitavecchia. The privateers repulsed the British, who lost eight men killed and wounded.The fireside book; a miscellany. (Philadelphia), Vol. 1, p.397. On 1 August, Phoebe captured two sett√©es, which a French squadron recaptured. In recapturing the settees, the French squadron involved lost an opportunity to capture Phoebe, though they did capture the schooner and a transport.Marshall (1823-1835), Vol. 4 Part 1, p.283-4. arrived at Gibraltar in March 1804 and then sailed from there to join Nelson off Toulon in company with Phoebe,Nelson and Nicholas (1845 - 1846), p.330. but the vessels became separated during a gale in the Gulf of Lyons. Shortly thereafter Hindostan caught fire and was totally destroyed.Fortunately, all but three of the 259 people on board were saved. On 13 June Phoebe and Amazon made ready to engage two French frigates anchored under the guns of the north-most fort at Toulon. The fort fired at Phoebe, but she was out of range. When the French fleet sortied, the British vessels rejoined their squadron, however the French fleet returned to port without engaging.James (1837), Vol. 2, p.237-8. On 24 August 1804 Phoebe and captured Venscab. On 10 November Phoebe captured Cacciatore. Then Phoebe and Hydra shared the proceeds from the capture between 9 and 15 November of the vessels Paulina and Sesostris. was passing the island of Toro (off Mallorca; ) on 4 April 1805 when Phoebe brought the news that the French fleet under Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve had escaped from Toulon. While Nelson made for Sicily to see if the French were heading for Egypt, Villeneuve entered Cadiz to link up with the Spanish fleet. Then, while Nelson was pursuing the French fleet from Toulon to the West Indies, Capel, in Phoebe, was in charge of a small squadron of five frigates and two bomb vessels with the mission of covering Sicily, Sardinia and the route to Egypt. Phoebe joined the blockade of Cadiz later in the summer. =Trafalgar= The arrival of the additional frigates Phoebe, , , , and off Cadiz allowed Nelson to detach them to disrupt local shipping supplying provisions for the Franco-Spanish Combined Fleet in Cadiz. In October, the frigate squadron was acting as the eyes of the British fleet. When the Combined Fleet put to sea on 19 October, Phoebe was first in line, followed by Naiad and the third rate . Capel spotted the Combined Fleet's exit and notified Nelson. As the combined fleet approached the British over the next couple of days, the frigates shadowed it, reporting on its movements. During the subsequent Battle of Trafalgar, Phoebe relayed Nelson's signals to the rest of fleet, and remained close to the action although she did not actually engage the enemy. In the gale that followed a few days later and Phoebe assisted two of the prizes, and Bahama, with the result that they were saved.In later life, Cappel would sit on the committee that would issue the Naval General Service Medal, one of the clasps of which read \\"Trafalgar\\". =North Sea and Baltic= In January 1806 Captain James Oswald took command. Phoebe then served in the North Sea and the Channel. On 9 July Phoebe, and were deployed to the Shetland Islands to find a French squadron reported to be destroying British and Russian fishing and merchant vessels in the Arctic.James (1837), Vol. 2, p.249. Although Phoebe met with no success, Blanche encountered and captured . Phoebe then sailed to the West Indies. On 18 January 1808, Phoebe sailed for the Mediterranean. In April 1809 Captain Hassard Stackpoole took command for the Baltic.> Between 7 and 12 July, Phoebe captured the Russian vessels Saint Nicholas 1 and Saint Nicholas 2, and another vessel, name unknown. In August Captain James Hillyar replaced Stackpoole. On 6 January 1810 Phoebe sailed from Torbay for off the √éle de Batz. Later she was in the Gulf of Livonia where her boats took numerous prizes. Between March and July 1810 Phoebe underwent repairs at Plymouth. She then sailed for the East Indies on 18 July. =Indian Ocean= By 21 November Phoebe was off the island of Rodrigues preparing for a joint naval and military expedition to take the √éle de France. The expedition arrived on 28 November and the French signed the capitulation on 3 December. In March 1811, Phoebe survived two major hurricanes in the Indian Ocean. Phoebe the participated in the Battle of Tamatave, where she fought another N√©r√©ide, under Captain Jean-Fran√ßois Lemaresquier. In the severe action the British captured Renomm√©e; N√©r√©ide surrendered subsequently on the 25th at Tamatave. The British took both vessels into service, N√©r√©ide as and Renomm√©e as . Phoebe suffered seven dead and 24 wounded. N√©r√©ide suffered some 130 men dead and wounded. In 1847 this battle earned Phoebe's surviving crew the clasp \\"Off Tamatave 20 May 1811\\" to the Naval General Service Medal. =Java= On 3 August 1811, Phoebe joined the fleet involved in the invasion of Java. Lieutenant-general Sir Samuel Auchmuty was the military commander-in-chief, and Commodore William Robert Broughton of the 74-gun third rate was the naval commander-in-chief. Later, Rear-Admiral Robert Stopford took charge of the naval forces. On 31 August Stopford detached the frigates , President, and Phoebe, and the sloop to take Cheribon, a seaport about 35 leagues east of Batavia. They arrived at dark on 3 September and the fort surrendered the next morning without a shot being fired.James (1837), Vol. VI, pp.38-9. On 11 September, all squadron re-embarked the seamen and marines that had landed, together with about 700 prisoners, including 237 Europeans. At 4 a.m. Nisus and Phoebe weighed and steered for Taggal, a port about 20 or 25 leagues further to the east. The next day Phoebe arrived off the harbour. Together with a landing party of seamen, marines, and some sepoys, Captain Hillyar took quiet possession of the fort and public stores. Phoebe, Nisus, President, and joined Stopford with Scipion and on 14 September. The next day they sailed for Surabaya. On 17 September they anchored off Ledayo on the Java shore where three transports with 450 men joined them. There they learned that the Dutch and French had surrendered the day before. The troops landed two days later and took possession of the place on 20 September under the general terms of the capitulation. In 1847 the Admiralty authorized the issuance of the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Java\\" to all remaining survivors of the campaign. Phoebe arrived at Plymouth Dock on 18 January 1812 with dispatches from the East Indies. War of 1812 On 9 April 1812 Phoebe sailed with a convoy for Quebec. She returned to Deal on 2 August. On 30 September she was in Plymouth, having brought dispatches from Halifax. She then underwent a refit. In late December 1812, Phoebe captured two American schooners. One was the Vengeance, an American letter of marquee 12-gun schooner from New York, bound to Bordeaux, laden with sugar and coffee. Vengeance arrived in Plymouth on 8 January. The Royal Navy took Vengeance into service as . Vengeance was closely followed by Hunter, a privateer schooner, of 14 guns and 100 men. The capture of Hunter occurred on 23 December after a chase during which she threw 12 of her guns overboard. Earlier, Hunter had captured a transport and a brig from a convoy under the escort of hired armed cutter Nimrod.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4736. A few days later, Phoebe was sailing off the Azores in the company of the 74-gun third rate , under the command of Francis Austen, the brother of the acclaimed novelist Jane Austen, together with . On 27 December they captured the American privateer schooner Swordfish of Gloucester, John Evans, master. Swordfish was 16 days out of Boston and had a crew of 82 men, and originally twelve 6-pounder guns. However, she had thrown 10 overboard during the chase, which took 11 hours and covered more than 100 miles. On 18 March 1813 Phoebe left Portsmouth with a convoy for Brazil and the East Indies. On 6 July Phoebe, the sloop-of-war , and sailed from Rio de Janeiro around Cape Horn to the Juan Fern√°ndez Islands. There, Racoon continued on to the fur trading outpost of Fort Astoria. Phoebe and Cherub remained to search for the 36-gun . Hillyar was under orders to capture the Essex \\"at all costs\\". =USS Essex= On 8 February 1814 Phoebe and Cherub arrived at Valpara√≠so, a neutral port, where Essex and her prizes were anchored. Having trapped Essex in the harbour, Hillyar waited six weeks for her to come out and thwarted all of the efforts of her captain, David Porter, to escape. Eventually, on 28 March, Porter attempted to break out of the harbour. A squall took off his main topmast and he attempted to return to harbour but Phoebe and Cherub drove Essex into a nearby bay and defeated her in a short engagement. Phoebe and Cherub also captured Essex's tender, Essex Junior, the ex-British whaler Atlantic. In the engagement with Essex, Phoebe had four men killed, including her first lieutenant, and seven men wounded. Cherub had one killed and three wounded, including her captain. The British reported that Essex had 24 killed and 45 wounded, though the Americans reported higher casualties. In 1847 the then surviving crew members of Phoebe and Cherub were awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasps \\"Phoebe 28 March 1814\\" and \\"Cherub 28 March 1814\\". On 31 May Phoebe and Essex set sail for England, with Lieutenant Pearson of Phoebe commanding the prize crew on Essex. On the way they stopped for some time in Rio de Janeiro. The two ships finally anchored in Plymouth sound on 13 November. The Admiralty promoted Pearson to Commander, and repaired Essex, taking her into service as HMS Essex. On 19 June, Cherub recaptured near the Sandwich Islands. Sir Andrew Hammond was a whaler that Porter had captured and left at Nuka Hiva, together with other captured vessels, including the Greenwich and the former British letter-of-marque whaler, USS Seringapatam, the whole being under the command of Lieutenant John M. Gamble USMC. When Gamble made preparations to leave the island, many of his party mutinied. Gamble and seven men (four unfit for duty) escaped and sailed Sir Andrew Hammond 2000 miles before they had the misfortune to meet up with Cherub.Mooney (1976), Vol. 6, p.517. Fate Phoebe was paid off in 1814 and laid up at Plymouth in August 1815. Between January 1823 and October 1826 she was a receiving ship and slop ship. She became a hulk in 1826 at Plymouth. Phoebe was sold for breaking up to Joshua Crystall for ¬£1,750 on 25 May 1841.

It is composed of the elements uodal- meaning \\"(noble) heritage\\" and -rich meaning \\"rich, powerful\\". Attested from the 8th century as the name of Alamannic nobility, the name is popularly given from the high medieval period in reference to Saint Ulrich of Augsburg (canonized 993). The surname Ulrich is most prevalent in Germany and has the highest density in Switzerland. This last name was found in the United States around the year 1840. Most Americans with the last name were concentrated in Pennsylvania, which was home to many German immigrant communities. Nowadays in the United States, the name is distributed largely in the Pennsylvania-Ohio region . History Documents record the Old High German name Oadalrich or Uodalrich from the later 8th century in Alamannia.Oadalrich (791, 808), Hoadalrich (805), Uadalricus (803), Uodalrich (Annales Alamannici), Udalrich (Annales Fuldenses) E. F√∂rstemann, Altdeutsches Namenbuch (1856), 980f. The related name Adalric (Anglo-Saxon cognate √Üthelric) is attested from the 6th century (Athalaric King of the Ostrogoths; √Üthelric of Bernicia). The name of Agilolfing duke Odilo (fl. 709-748) may represent a short form of the name. Count Udalrich I (fl. 778-814), a son of Gerold of Vinzgau, founded the Alamannic Udalriching dynasty, ancestral to the counts of Bregenz. The given name occurred frequently in the Alamannic Hunfriding dynasty in the 9th to 10th centuries; examples include Odalric, Count of Barcelona (fl. 850s) and Odalric, Count of Thurgau (fl. 920s). The name is recorded in an Icelandic form as √ì√∞alr√≠kr only in the later medieval period.Sk√°lholtsb√≥k; see Gu√∞r√∫n P. Helgad√≥ttir, Hrafns Saga Sveinbjarnarsonar (1987), p. 87. In the Middle High German period the name generally commemorated Saint Ulrich, Bishop of Augsburg (c. 890 ‚Äì 4 July 973), who twice defended Augsburg from attacks by Magyars. The Swiss Reformer Ulrich Zwingli etymologized his given name as Huldrych (Huldricus, Huldaricus), i.e. \\"rich in grace\\". Zwingli's given name was Ulrich, but he used the latinized spelling Huldricus or Huldrychus Zwinglius beginning in the 1520s. In his enrolement in the University of Vienna (1500), he still latinised his name as Udalricus Zwingling de Lichtensteig. (Jackson, Huldreich Zwingli : the reformer of German Switzerland (1900), p. 57.) His signature at the Marburg Colloquy (1529) was Huldrychus Zwinglius (Schuler, Schultess (eds.), Huldrici Zuinglii opera, 1830, p. 55). In the wake of Zwingli, during the 16th century and well into the 18th century, it became a fashion - especially for Protestant writers - to latinise the given name Ulrich as Huldricus.e.g. Huldricus Mutius (Ulrich Hugwald), Huldricus Huttenus (Ulrich von Hutten), 'Hulrdicus Euchaustius, so in a 1776 edition of the acts of the Council of Trent. The name was popularly given in 20th-century Switzerland, especially from the 1940s to the 1960s, peaking at rank 16 in 1947, but dropping below rank 100 in 1972.behindthename.com (Ulrich) In Czechoslovakia, Old≈ôich was popularly given in the 1940s to 1950s, peaking at rank 18 during 1946-1951. behindthename.com (Oldrich) Variants The German given name was adopted in Czech and Slovak as Old≈ôich, Oldrich and in Scandinavian as Ulrik, in Slovenian as Urh, in Latvia as Uldis. Common German hypocoristics are Uli or Ulli (Swiss Ueli) and historically Utz. A Czech/Slovak hypocoristic is Volek and a Polish one Ryczek. A feminine form Ulrike, Ulrica is recorded from the early modern period.

There exist 34 naturally occurring nuclei that are believed to undergo double electron capture, but the process has been confirmed by observation in the decay of only three nuclides: , , and . One reason is that the probability of double electron capture is stupendously small; the half-lives for this mode lie well above 10 years. A second reason is that the only detectable particles created in this process are X-rays and Auger electrons that are emitted by the excited atomic shell. In the range of their energies (~1‚Äì10 keV), the background is usually high. Thus, the experimental detection of double electron capture is more difficult than that for double beta decay. Double electron capture can be accompanied by the excitation of the daughter nucleus. Its de-excitation, in turn, is accompanied by an emission of photons with energies of hundreds of keV.  Modes with positron emission  If the mass difference between the mother and daughter atoms is more than two masses of an electron (1.022 MeV), the energy released in the process is enough to allow another mode of decay, called electron capture with positron emission. It occurs along with double electron capture, their branching ratio depending on nuclear properties. When the mass difference is more than four electron masses (2.044 MeV), the third mode, called double positron decay, is allowed. Only six naturally occurring nuclides can decay via these three modes simultaneously.  Neutrinoless double electron capture  The above-described process with the capture of two electrons and emission of two neutrinos (two-neutrino double electron capture) is allowed by the Standard Model of particle physics: No conservation laws (including lepton number conservation) are violated. However, if the lepton number is not conserved, or the neutrino is its own antiparticle, another kind of process can occur: the so-called neutrinoless double electron capture. In this case, two electrons are captured by nucleus, but neutrinos are not emitted. The energy released in this process is carried away by an internal bremsstrahlung gamma quantum. Example: :{ border=\\"0\\" - style=\\"height:2em;\\"  + 2 ‚Üí  } This mode of decay has never been observed experimentally, and would contradict the Standard Model if it were observed.

Originally known simply as the U.S. Courthouse and Federal Office Building, the building was renamed in honor of longtime U.S. Senator Dennis Chavez in 1976. The Dennis Chavez Building was designed by the Albuquerque firm of Flatow, Moore, Bryan, and Fairburn, which had previously been responsible for other local highrises like the Simms Building and Bank of the West Tower. The steel-framed building is faced with polished granite, with New Mexico marble used in the ground floor lobby. It is in height and has 13 above-ground floors with a basement and underground parking garage. When built, it was the third-tallest building in New Mexico after the Bank of the West Tower and the New Mexico Bank & Trust Building. It is currently the seventh-tallest building in Albuquerque.

The series started in the 1930s and finishes in the 1960s. They form part of the 'realistic adventure' tradition in children's literature, following on from similar works by E. Nesbit and Arthur Ransome. Plot The stories are set mainly in the Berkshire countryside, at the farmhouse home of the children's grandmother, a Scottish-born woman named Mrs Hawthorne. The farm is called Smockfarthing, and is near to an imaginary village called Smockfarthing Wick, which in turn is close to a town called Riverton. Although these names are invented, they are based on real places - Smockfarthing is actually a house called Stonehill House, and Riverton is Abingdon. The house is mainly inhabited by John, Mary and their aunt 'Push', as well as their grandmother, and they are all real people - Push is Grace James herself, 'Mrs Hawthorne' is her mother, and John and Mary (or Giovanni and Maria) are her nephew and niece. John and Mary's parents live in RomeHorti Flaviani - the Cavalletti family home, where John and Mary lived when they were in Rome (later converted into a hotel), as their father is Italian and works there apparently as a diplomat (his work is described in John and Mary Revisit Rome as \\"involving a great deal of travelling about to far-off places\\") - he is married to John and Mary's mother, Push's sister (their real names were Henry and Elspeth Cavalletti). John and Mary are educated at home by a governess called Miss Rose Brown, although they spend about half their time in Rome, and indeed are bilingual in English and Italian. Smockfarthing carries a full complement of servants, including Mrs. Dyer the cook, Ellen the parlourmaid, Lizzie (whom the children call Lisetta) the maid, and Edie Kittiwake, the nurse. Edie's father Kittiwake looks after the farm with his son Reggie, and they and Mrs. Kittiwake live in a house on the farm called the Round House. Other characters, such as schoolmasters, vicars, postmistresses and so on, crop up in the books from time to time as well. Although the series covers about thirty years, John and Mary are never allowed to grow up (only from about the ages of four to twelve) and nothing ever changes very much in their surroundings. This leads to situations such as the war and rationing being discussed during the 1940s, and television and washing machines being mentioned in the 1960s. (One can only assume that Grace James wished to appeal to a constantly fresh readership, although children of the 1960s could possibly have found it rather odd that John and Mary would still have a governess and maids running around after them, in that era.) The John and Mary stories involve the children doing fairly normal and day-to-day things within their environment (mainly the countryside), although James makes sure that they meet unusual people and have adventures along the way. The stories are written in a realistic way and the adventures are the kind of adventures that any children could have under the same circumstances. John and Mary's Aunt is not about John and Mary at all, but is about James herself and her upbringing as a child in Japan. We learn that she was born in Tokyo and lived there until she was about twelve, although no exact dates are given. She does mention that her father was part of a naval mission and was there as an instructor - this seems to fit in with the time of the 'Douglas Mission' to Japan, which commenced in 1873 (hence the photographs in the book of her and her siblings in Victorian children's clothing). The books were published by Frederick Muller and were illustrated by Mary Gardiner.

The party boycotted 2002's general election along with several other opposition groups, but did take part in 2006's parliamentary election, in which it won no seats. The party is the direct descendant of the militant organisation, the Islamic Front for the Liberation of Bahrain, whose members were pardoned after wide ranging political reforms instigated by King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa in 2001.Religious body floats demands for elections , Habib Toumi, gulfnews, March 8, 2006 With the reforms, they returned from exile or were released from prison and formed the Islamic Action Society.

He was though expelled to Iran after he set up the Front, but in 1981 he attempted to return to Bahrain as the head of a theocratic government in a failed coup d'√©tat. The Front was accused by the government for a series of terror attacks on civilian targets in the 1990s including a bomb attack on the Diplomat Hotel in Manama in 1996 injuring four people. A spokesman claiming responsibility for the bombings told the Associated Press \\"We put a bomb in the Diplomat hotel 20 minutes ago ... after the feast ... tell the government that we will destroy everyplace.\\"HOTEL-LOBBY EXPLOSION INJURES 4 IN BAHRAIN, Adnan Malik, Deseret News, Monday, Feb. 12, 1996 The party often calls for public demonstrations and political seminars focusing on the issues affecting the majority Shƒ´ ªa, who have been ruled by the minority Sunnis for many decades. In September 2005, its license was temporarily suspended after a crowded festival was held honouring those imprisoned by the government on suspicion of involvement in an alleged 1981 coup. The party resumed activities after the temporary suspension.

Lymexylidae belong to the suborder Polyphaga and are the sole member of the superfamily Lymexyloidea. Habitat and behavior Example of an infested tree Lymexylon, Elateroides, and Melittomma are pests to forest trees such as chestnut, poplar, and oak, and can be found worldwide. Some species are parasitic, causing decay in living trees and damaging timber structures such as houses and ships. Wood boring activities occur primarily in the larva stage, with the larvae damaging both sapwood and heartwood. Lymexylidae larvae bore into living and decaying wood (e.g. Chestnut, Populus, and Oak) where they consume the fungus Endomyces hylecoeti. =Symbiotic relationship with fungi= Lymexylidae larvae have a symbiotic association with certain types of fungi. The fungi grow in sheltered environments where they are tended by the larvae, such as the holes burrowed into the wood and, in return, the larvae feed on the fungi. Elateroides dermestoides lays eggs into boreholes of bark beetles on a fallen beech Specifically, this species has evolved a relationship with the yeast-like fungus Endomyces hylecoeti. Every egg the female lays is coated with fungal spores from a pouch near her ovipositor. The larvae hatch and subsequently collect some of the spores by remaining close to the egg shells for a period of time, before tunneling further into the wood. The fungi grow on the tunnel walls created by the larvae. The larvae then consume the fungus, rather than the wood itself. As the fungi require air flow to grow, the larvae ensure the tunnels are free of any debris.

Muller Repository for Germinal Choice, after Nobel laureate Hermann Joseph Muller) was a sperm bank that operated in Escondido, California from 1980 to 1999. The repository is commonly believed to have accepted only donations from recipients of the Nobel Prize, although in fact it accepted donations from non-Nobelists, also. The first baby conceived from the project was a girl born on April 19, 1982. Founded by Robert Klark Graham, the repository was dubbed the \\"Nobel prize sperm bank\\" by media reports at the time. The only contributor who became known publicly was William Shockley, Nobel laureate in physics. Management Robert Graham managed the bank until his death in February 1997 and the responsibilities were passed to Floyd Kimble, a businessman from Ohio who had shown interest in the bank. At the time of Graham's death, the bank claimed to have produced 229 children, none of them from sperm donated from Graham's initial focus, Nobel Prize winners.A Bizarre Tale of the Rise and Fall of an Elitist Sperm Bank, Janet Maslin, New York Times, June 2, 2005 When Kimble died in 1998 the combined relatives of both men decided to close down the bank. All sperm samples were destroyed; it remains unclear what happened to the Repository's records. Donors Although most news articles of the time made much of the Repository's \\"Nobel sperm\\" standards, in fact the Repository is only known to have stocked the sperm of one Nobelist, William Shockley. Other donors were recruited from among the ranks of scientists and academics Graham and his assistant, Paul Smith, considered to be \\"the future Nobel laureates\\". Graham's initial attempts to recruit Nobel laureates who lived near the Repository yielded only three volunteers, Shockley among them; however, when the news media began reporting on the existence and intentions of the Repository, two of the laureates broke off their ties to Graham and did not donate. Only Shockley remained, and even he donated only once. Paul Smith was charged with recruiting new donors, and he traveled throughout California, focusing mainly on college campuses, in search of volunteers. Smith later estimated his \\"hit rate\\" of donors signed up compared to men he invited to be \\"six or eight, maybe ten\\" out of one hundred. The search was expanded to country-wide, and eventually more donors were recruited, although none of them were ‚Äì then or currently ‚Äì Nobel laureates. At the time of his death, Graham had expanded his requirements to allow athletes, artists, and businessmen as donors. One donor named Jason Kaiser, known as Orange Red at the repository, was featured in the 2003 documentary Genius Sperm Bank, which the Discovery Channel broadcast in 2004. The documentary briefly touched upon his viewpoints at the time, and reunited him with three of the nine children that reputedly had resulted from his donations. Although not a Nobel laureate, Kaiser did achieve a master of science degree in cytogenetics. Recipients As with the Repository's criteria to accept sperm donors, its criteria for women to receive sperm from the bank were not as high as initially reported. Rumors that women were required to be members of Mensa were false; in fact, women did not need to meet any particular intellectual requirement. Essentially, any woman who was married, in good health, and not homosexual was accepted; the only women reported to have been refused sperm were \\"one [woman] who took lithium, [and] another who was obese and diabetic.\\" Outcomes Graham's original intention was to monitor the outcomes of children produced through the bank's sperm, and he asked families using the bank's sperm to agree to periodic surveys; however, most recipients showed no interest in sharing information on their children once the procedure was over, and when he sent out a survey to recipient families in the early 1990s, few families responded. Two women who claimed to have been the recipients of Repository sperm and to have raised children born of that sperm responded anonymously to a series of articles in Slate in 2001. Both stated that their children were extremely intelligent and healthy. A later segment of the same Slate article reported on the highlights of the lives of fifteen of the resultant children. Of the fifteen, six reportedly had 4.0 GPAs and two were reported to be \\"artistically precocious\\". Still others were reported to be \\"geniuses\\" and \\"whizzes\\" at various disciplines. All the children contacted by Slate were in good health, except one, who had what his mother described as a \\"developmental disability\\". In media Journalist David Plotz wrote several articles on the repository for the online magazine, Slate. Plotz would later write a book about his experiences investigating the repository in the book The Genius Factory: The Curious History of the Nobel Prize Sperm Bank (2005). Moreover, a documentary, which aired on BBC Horizon in 2006, went over the history of the Repository and various statements made by Graham. The program also featured discussion from another donor, University of Central Oklahoma biology professor James Bidlack.The genius sperm bank The Big Bang Theory's pilot episode satirizes the repository when Leonard and Sheldon visit the \\"high-IQ sperm bank,\\" intending to donate specimens, only to leave after Sheldon suffers a moral crisis over committing \\"genetic fraud\\" by donating sperm that may not produce the promised genius offspring. Episode 5 of This is Life with Lisa Ling focused on the sperm bank, interviewing people who donated, people who went to the sperm bank seeking donated sperm, and people who were born as a result. The German novel Fast genial (\\"Almost Genius\\") by Benedict Wells tells the story of a fictitious child produced by the sperm bank, who searches for his biological father.

Development The RWD 4 was constructed by the RWD team of Stanis≈Çaw Rogalski, Stanis≈Çaw Wigura and Jerzy Drzewiecki in Warsaw. It was based upon their earlier RWD 2 design, but enlarged and fitted with more powerful inline engine. It retained the same fish-shaped fuselage without a direct view forward from the pilot's seat, though the view improved due to thin fuselage profile before the pilot. Also a silhouette became slimmer. The aircraft development was ordered by the Ministry of Communication especially for participation in the Challenge 1930 international air competition. At the same time, the RWD developed similar liaison aircraft project, the RWD 3, which shared many features with the RWD 4. The first three aircraft (registration SP-ADK, -ADL and -ADM) were completed and flown by the designer Jerzy Drzewiecki in early 1930. In late 1930, a further six aircraft were built for the Polish Aero Club (registration SP-AEK, -AEL, AEY, -AEZ, -AFC, -AGP). Service The first three aircraft took part in the Challenge 1930 competition in July. Only Jerzy Bajan completed the race on SP-ADM on the 32nd place (of 35 classified and 60 starting crews). Franciszek ≈ªwirko (flying with Stanis≈Çaw Wigura) withdrew due to engine failure, while the third pilot Tadeusz Karpi≈Ñski withdrew due to illness. RWD 4s were later used in Polish local air competitions, with some success (for example, F. ≈ªwirko won the 3rd Polish Light Aircraft Contest in 1930, and other RWD 4s took the 2nd, 5th and 6th place). In 1931, in an international air meeting in Zagreb, Jerzy Bajan won 2nd place overall and the 1st place in aerobatics. RWD 4s were also used for training and glider towing in regional aero clubs.

Darts career According to Bray himself, his calling career began one night when the regular caller failed to show for a county match. Russ was then contracted to call for the PDC in 1996 and was given his debut at the World Matchplay in Blackpool. He was the caller when Phil Taylor hit the PDC's first-ever televised nine-darter in 2002 at the same event. He has called seven more nine-darters live on TV since then including the first televised nine-darter outside of Europe by Mervyn King in Johannesburg, South Africa. Bray was a county player for Hertfordshire and subsequently played on the pro circuit. He teamed up with Eric Bristow to win the Norway and Finland pairs. Bray also hit the bullseye on a standard dartboard from 10 feet, outdoors, on Blackpool's North Pier, thus achieving a Guinness World Record in the process. Russ beat the day's previous best of 9' 6\\" which was achieved by fellow PDC official, Scott Gibling. Other work Bray has made use of his raspy voice in more commercial work in recent years.

She then took a family hostage and shot another man, non-fatally, before killing herself. Early life Dann was born in Chicago and grew up in Glencoe, a north suburb of Chicago. She was the daughter of an accountant, Norman Wasserman, and his wife, Edith Joy. Those who knew Dann described her as shy and withdrawn. She graduated from New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois, in 1975, and although she had poor grades in high school she was able to attend Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa. When her grades improved, she transferred to the University of Arizona with the goal of becoming a teacher. She began dating a pre-med student, and the relationship soon became serious, but she was becoming possessive and demanding. In the summer of 1977 she attended the University of Wisconsin in Madison, taking a course in home economics. In 1980, with the relationship failing, Dann moved back to her parents' home. She then transferred to Northwestern University to complete her degree, but she dropped out of all her classes and never graduated. Marriage and divorce She met and married Russell Dann, an executive in an insurance broker firm in September 1982, but the marriage quickly soured as Russell's family noted signs of obsessive-compulsive disorder and strange behavior including leaving trash around the house. She saw a psychiatrist for a short period, who identified her childhood and upbringing as a cause of her problems. Laurie and Russell Dann separated in October 1985. The divorce negotiations were acrimonious, with Laurie claiming that Russell was abusive. In the following months, the police were called to investigate various incidents, including several harassing phone calls made to Russell and his family. In April 1986, Laurie Dann accused Russell of breaking into and vandalizing her parents' house, where she was then living. Shortly after, she purchased a Smith & Wesson .357 Magnum, telling the salesman that she needed it for self-defense. The police were concerned about her gun ownership and unsuccessfully tried to persuade Dann and her family that she should give up the gun. In August 1986, she contacted her ex-boyfriend, who was by then a resident at a hospital, and claimed to have had his child. When he refused to believe her, Dann called the hospital where he worked and claimed he had raped her in the emergency room. In September 1986, Russell Dann reported he had been stabbed in his sleep with an icepick. He accused Laurie of the crime, although he had not actually seen his attacker. The police decided not to press charges against Laurie based on a medical report which suggested that the injury might have been self- inflicted, as well as Russell's abrasive attitude towards the police and his failed polygraph test. Russell and his family continued to receive harassing hang-up phone calls, and Laurie was arrested for calls made to Russell's sister. The charges were dropped due to lack of evidence. Just before their divorce was finalized in April 1987, Laurie accused Russell of raping her. There were no physical signs supporting Laurie's claim, although she passed two polygraph tests. In May 1987, Laurie accused Russell of placing an incendiary device in her home. No charges were filed against Russell for either alleged event. Laurie's parents believed her claims and supported and defended her throughout. By this time, Laurie Dann was being treated by another psychiatrist for obsessive-compulsive disorder and a \\"chemical imbalance\\"; the psychiatrist told police that he did not think Laurie was suicidal or homicidal. Final year Dann worked as a babysitter, and some employers were happy with the care she provided their children. Others made complaints to the police about damage to their furniture and the theft of food and clothes. Despite the complaints, no charges were pressed. Dann's father did pay for damages in one case. In the summer of 1987, Dann sublet a university apartment in Evanston, Illinois. Once again, her strange behavior was noted, including riding up and down in elevators for hours, wearing rubber gloves to touch metal, and leaving meat to rot in sofa cushions. She took no classes at the university. In the fall of 1987, Dann claimed she had received threatening letters from Russell and that he had sexually assaulted her in a parking lot, but the police did not believe her. A few weeks later, she purchased a .32-caliber Smith & Wesson revolver. With her condition deteriorating, Dann and her family sought specialized help. In November 1987, she moved to Madison, Wisconsin, to live in a student residence while being observed by a psychiatrist who specialized in obsessive-compulsive disorder. She had already begun taking clomipramine, a drug for OCD, and her new psychiatrist increased the dosage, adding lithium carbonate to reduce her mood swings and initiating behavioral therapy to work on her phobias and ritualistic behaviors. Despite the intervention, her strange behavior continued, including riding elevators for long periods, changing television channels repetitively, and an obsession with \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" numbers. There were also concerns about whether she was bulimic. Dann purchased a .22 semi- automatic Beretta at the end of December 1987. In March 1988, she stopped attending her appointments with the psychiatrist and behavior therapist. At about the same time, she began to make preparations for the attacks. She stole books from the library on poisons, and she diluted arsenic and other chemicals from a lab. She also shoplifted clothes and wigs to disguise herself and was arrested for theft on one occasion. Both her psychiatrist and her father tried to persuade her to enter the hospital as an inpatient, but she refused. Dann continued to make numerous hang-up phone calls to her former in-laws and babysitting clients. Eventually, the calls escalated to death threats. An ex- boyfriend and his wife also received dozens of threatening calls. In May 1988, a letter, later confirmed to have been sent by Laurie Dann, was sent to the hospital administration where her ex-boyfriend then worked, again accusing him of sexual assault. Since the phone calls were across state lines, the FBI became involved, and a federal indictment against Dann was prepared. However, the ex-boyfriend, fearful of publicity, and concerned about Dann getting bail and then attempting to fulfill her threats against him, decided to wait until other charges were filed in Illinois. In May 1988, a janitor found her lying in the fetal position inside a garbage bag in a trash room. This precipitated a search of her room and her departure back to Glencoe. Attacks During the days before May 20, 1988, Laurie Dann prepared rice cereal snacks and juice boxes poisoned with the diluted arsenic she had stolen in Madison. She mailed them to a former acquaintance, ex-babysitting clients, her psychiatrist, Russell Dann, and others. In the early morning of May 20, she personally delivered snacks and juice \\"samples\\" to acquaintances, and families for whom she had babysat, some of whom had not seen her for years. Other snacks were delivered to Alpha Tau Omega, Psi Upsilon, and Kappa Sigma fraternity houses and Leverone Hall at Northwestern University in Evanston. Notes were attached to some of the deliveries.Sources ascribe similar notes to different recipients. For example, Associated Press articles mention that a note \\"Love your little sisters. Enjoy\\" was sent to a family, while a Chicago Tribune article, and Kaplan et al. book suggests that similar notes (\\"Love, your little sisters. Enjoy\\" and \\"To the ATOs, from your little sisters\\") were received by fraternities. Similarly, a longer text \\"I'm going to be in Glencoe when your in town-look forward to seeing you guys. I was going to send you coffee cake, but I was making rice crispy treats for school and decided to send some. Enjoy. Love, Laurie\\" was sent by mail according to the Kaplan et al. book, and attached to the fraternity deliveries according to the Egginton book.Ray Gibson and Linnet Myers, \\"School Killer Left A Trail Of Poison Fraternities, Homes Receive Tainted Food\\", Chicago Tribune (22 May 1988) 1. The drinks were often leaking and the squares unpleasant-tasting, so few were actually consumed. In addition, the arsenic was highly diluted so nobody became seriously ill. At about 9:00 a.m. on the 20th, Dann arrived at the home of the Rushe family, former babysitting clients in Winnetka, Illinois, to pick up their two youngest children. The family had just told Dann they were moving away. Instead of taking the children on the promised outing, she took them to Ravinia Elementary School in Highland Park, Illinois, where she erroneously believed that both of her former sister-in-law's two sons were enrolled (in fact, one of Dann's intended targets was not even a student at the school). She left the two children in the car while she entered the school and tried to detonate a fire bomb in one of the school's hallways. After Dann's departure, the small fire she set was subsequently discovered by students, and quickly extinguished by a teacher. She drove to a local daycare attended by her ex- sister-in-law's daughter and tried to enter the building with a plastic can of gasoline, but was stopped by staff. Next Dann drove the children back to their home and offered them some arsenic-poisoned milk, but the boys spat it out because it tasted strange to them. Once at their home, she lured them downstairs and used gasoline to set fire to the house, trapping their mother and the two children in the basement (they managed to escape). She drove three and a half blocks to the Hubbard Woods Elementary School with three handguns in her possession. She wandered into a second grade classroom for a short while, then left. Finding a boy in the corridor, Dann pushed him into the boys' washroom and shot him with a .22 semi-automatic Beretta pistol. Her Smith & Wesson .357 Magnum revolver jammed when she tried to fire it at two other boys, and she threw it into the trash along with the spare ammunition. The boys ran out of the washroom and raised the alarm. Dann then reentered the second grade classroom where students were working in groups on a bicycle safety test. She ordered all the children into the corner of the room. The teacher refused and attempted to disarm Dann, managing to unload the Beretta in the struggle. Dann drew a .32 Smith & Wesson from the waistband of her shorts and aimed it at several groups of the students. She shot five children, killing eight-year-old Nick Corwin and wounding two girls and two boys before fleeing in her car. Dann was prevented from leaving the area by car because the roads were closed for a funeral cortege. She decided to drive her car backwards down the nearby street, but the road dead-ended into a private drive. Abandoning her car, she removed her bloodstained shorts and tied a blue garbage bag around her waist. With her two remaining guns she made her way through the woods and came upon the house of the Andrew family. Dann entered the house and met a mother and her twenty-year-old son, who were in the kitchen. She claimed she was raped and had shot the rapist in the struggle. The Andrews were sympathetic and tried to convince her that she need not fear the police because she had acted in self-defense. Mrs. Andrew gave Dann a pair of her daughter's pants to wear. While she was putting them on, Philip Andrew was able to pick up and pocket the Beretta. He suggested that she call her family. Dann agreed and called her mother, telling her she had done something terrible and that the police were involved. Philip took the phone and explained Dann's story about the rape and shooting, suggesting that Mrs. Wasserman come to get Dann; Mrs. Wasserman said she could not come because she did not have a car. Mr. Andrew arrived home, and they continued to argue with Dann, insisting she give up the second gun. Dann called her mother again and this time Mr. Andrew spoke with Mrs. Wasserman, asking her to persuade Dann to give up the gun. While Dann spoke with her mother, Mrs. Andrew left the house and alerted the police. Mr. Andrew told Dann that he would not remain in the house if she did not put down the gun, and also left the house. Dann ordered Philip to stay. Just before noon, seeing the police advancing on the house she shot Philip in the chest, but he managed to escape out the back door before collapsing and being rescued by the police and ambulance personnel. With the house surrounded, Dann went upstairs to a bedroom. The Wassermans and Russell Dann were brought to the house. At about 7:00 p.m., an assault team entered the house while Mr. Wasserman attempted to get Dann's attention with a bullhorn. The police found her body in the bedroom; she had shot herself in the mouth. Aftermath Nicky Corwin remembered at March for Our Lives on 24 March 2018 in Washington, D.C. All but one of the victims wounded by Dann recovered from their injuries, including the schoolgirl who was shot and suffered severe internal injuries. The victims, school children, and parents received extensive support to help them cope with the psychological after- effects of the attacks. Parents and members of the community subsequently devoted many years to gun control policy. Philip Andrew gave interviews about gun control from his hospital bed, and later became active in local and state gun control organizations as the executive director of the Illinois Council Against Handgun Violence; he subsequently became a lawyer and then an FBI agent. The Dann shootings also fueled the debate about criteria for committing mentally ill people to mental health facilities against their will. Some favored the involuntary commitment of a person who is determined to be mentally ill and incapable of making informed decisions about treatment; civil libertarians like Benjamin Wolf (staff counsel for the ACLU of Illinois) opposed the idea saying, \\"It would be a shame if we cut back on the civil liberties of literally millions of mentally ill people because of the occasional bizarre incident.\\" A book called Murder of Innocence was written by Eric Zorn about the tragedy, and a made-for-television film of the same name was based on it. In the film, Dann's name is changed to Laurie Wade. She was played by Valerie Bertinelli. Russell Dann helped coach Bertinelli while she was preparing for the role. Search for a rationale Some blamed Dann's family for defending and protecting her in spite of the signs of her deteriorating mental health. Investigations were hampered by the Wassermans' refusal to be interviewed by police or to provide access to Dann's psychiatric records‚Äîthe records were eventually obtained by court order. On the night of Dann's death, the Wassermans allowed only a very brief search of her bedroom, after which they cleaned it and removed potential evidence. The police were criticized for not sealing off Dann's room as part of the crime scene. Parents of the shooting victims subsequently sued the Wasserman family for damages. Further criticism was directed at Dann's psychiatrists for failing to identify or take action regarding the signs of Dann's decreasing mental stability. At the time of her suicide, Dann was taking an unlicensed drug, clomipramine. The effects of this drug were initially considered as contributing factors to Dann's mental well-being, but ultimately ruled out. Two newspaper clippings were found among Dann's possessions after her death. One described a man who randomly killed two people in a public building. The other described a depressed young man who had attempted to commit suicide in the same way that Dann did; he survived and discovered that his brain injury had cured him of his obsessive-compulsive disorder. One theory of Dann's rationale was that she targeted people who had \\"disappointed\\" her in some way: her ex-husband, her former sister-in-law (through the firebombing attempts at her children's schools and daycare), her ex-boyfriend and his wife, the family who was moving away, as well as former friends and babysitting clients. Dann was also briefly investigated as a possible suspect in the Chicago Tylenol murders, but no direct connection was found. In his book The Myth of Male Power, author Warren Farrell suggested that Laurie Dann's actions were an example of women's violence against men. He claimed, erroneously, that all of Dann's victims were male, that she burned down a Young Men's Jewish Council, burned two boys in a basement, shot her own son, and alleged that she killed an eight-year old rapist. Men's rights activists, academics, and the media have repeated Farrell's errors and conclusion. Farrell later issued a correction on his web site.

He published many emerging American and European writers. Life and career Thayer was born in Worcester, Massachusetts on 12 December 1889 to Edward D. Thayer and Florence (n√©e Scofield) Thayer. The Thayers were a prominent and wealthy Massachusetts family. Scofield's father was the owner of several area woollen mills, a founding investor in the Crompton & Thayer Loom Company, and a director of the Worcester Trust Company. Scofield's uncle Ernest Thayer was the author of the well-known poem \\"Casey at the Bat\\". Thayer was a Harvard University student. His Harvard years would prove formative; during them Thayer would serve on the staff of the Harvard Monthly. During these years Thayer would also meet many other young poets and authors, including E. E. Cummings, Alan Seeger, Lincoln MacVeagh, Arthur Wilson (later known as Winslow Wilson) and Gilbert Seldes. A large dormitory for freshmen at Harvard, in which E. E. Cummings once roomed (room 306), is named after the Thayer family. Thayer graduated from Harvard in 1913. After Harvard, Thayer went to Oxford for post-graduate studies at the same time as T. S. Eliot.Kirsch, Adam, \\"The Rebellion of E.E. Cummings\\", The Harvard Magazine, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, March‚ÄìApril 2005. Thayer married Elaine Orr on 21 June 1916. He commissioned his friend E. E. Cummings to write his poem \\"Epithalamion\\" as a wedding present. The marriage did not last long, however, and Thayer moved to his own place. By 1919 Elaine was having an affair with Cummings, giving birth to their daughter, Nancy, in December of that year. Thayer's involvement with The Dial began in April 1918 when he purchased $600 USD worth of stock in the magazine. In late 1919, Thayer and his fellow Harvard alumnus Dr. James Sibley Watson, Jr. purchased The Dial from the owner, Martyn Johnson, who was suffering financial trouble. Dr. Watson became the magazine's president while Thayer took up the post of editor. The new team produced its first issue of Dial in January 1920. The issue featured works from E. E. Cummings, Gaston Lachaise, Arthur Wilson (Winslow Wilson) and Carl Sandburg. In July 1921, Thayer sailed for Europe. He settled in Vienna, and, although he would remain there for more than two years, he continued to direct the operations of The Dial. He solicited financial backing from European investors and sent layout and content instructions back to the magazine's offices in New York regularly. While in Vienna he was psychoanalysed by Sigmund Freud. During the mid-1920s Thayer began to suffer a series of mental breakdowns, and began to deteriorate. He resigned as editor of The Dial in June 1926, and spent the remainder of his life in the care of relatives and various institutions and sanatoria. He was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. Watson continued with The Dial, working with editor Marianne Moore. Their final issue was published in July 1929. Thayer was certified insane in 1937, the year after his mother died. He thenceforth lived the secluded life of a rich man, surrounded by servants, and moving among homes in Bermuda, Florida, Boston, and his family home on Martha's Vineyard. He died on 9 July 1982 at the age of 93, leaving a bequest of 400 items from his art collection to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He left his Aubrey Beardsley collection of drawings to the Fogg Art Museum. He is buried in Rural Cemetery in Worcester, Massachusetts.

His prosecution by the McCarran Security Committee led to his move to England, where he became an English classical scholar and eventually master of Darwin College, Cambridge. His most notable work is The Ancient Economy (1973) in which he argued that the economy in antiquity was governed by status and civic ideology, rather than rational economic motivations. Early life Finley was born in 1912 in New York City to Nathan Finkelstein and Anna Katzenellenbogen. About 1946, he took the surname Finley. He was educated at Syracuse University, where, aged fifteen, he graduated magna cum laude in psychology, and at Columbia University. Although his M.A. was in public law, most of his published work was in the field of ancient history, especially the social and economic aspects of the classical world. Career =United States= Finley taught at Columbia University and City College of New York, where he was influenced by members of the Frankfurt School who were working in exile in America. He then taught at Rutgers University. Red scare On 5 September 1951, an ex-communist, Karl Wittfogel, testified before HUAC that Finley was a communist. On 28 March 1952, Finley appeared before HUAC and invoked the Fifth Amendment regarding his connections to communism. On 7 September 1952, Lewis Webster Jones, the president of Rutgers University, announced his intention to appoint Trustee and Faculty Committees to review the cases of professors involved in government inquiries. On 15 November 1952, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover met with Jones to discuss the cases. On 12 December 1952, Rutger's Board of Trustees resolution declared, \\"It shall be cause for immediate dismissal of any member of faculty or staff\\" to fail to co-operate with government inquiries. On 31 December 1952, Rutgers fired Finley. Rutgers University records show: > On 3 December 1952, the Special Faculty Committee issued a report stating > there should be no charges against Heimlich or Finley and that the > University should take no further action in the matter. However, the > Trustees, who had the final say in the matter, issued a resolution on 12 > December 1952: \\"it shall be cause for immediate dismissal of any member of > faculty or staff\\" who invokes the Fifth Amendment before an investigatory > body in refusing to answer questions relating to communist affiliations and > that Professors Heimlich and Finley would be dismissed as of December of 31, > 1952 unless they conformed to thevnew policy. Neither chose to do so. There > was protest at the decision by members of the faculty, who formed an > Emergency Committee on the matter. In 1954, he appeared before the United States Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security (SISS), which asked him whether he had ever been a member of the Communist Party USA. He again invoked the Fifth Amendment and refused to answer. =Britain= Finley immigrated to Britain, where he was appointed university lecturer in classics at Cambridge (1955‚Äì1964) and, in 1957, elected to a fellowship at Jesus College. He was reader in ancient social and economic history (1964‚Äì1970), professor of ancient history (1970‚Äì1979) and master of Darwin College (1976‚Äì1982).Article on Finley in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, 2004 He broadened the scope of classical studies from philology to culture, economics, and society. He became a British subject in 1962 and a Fellow of the British Academy in 1971, and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1979. He was a doctorate adviser to Paul Millett, now a senior lecturer in Classics at the University of Cambridge. Work Among his works, The World of Odysseus (1954, revised ed. with additional essays 1978) proved seminal. In it, he applied the findings of ethnologists and anthropologists like Marcel Mauss to illuminate Homer, a radical approach that was thought by his publishers to require a reassuring introduction by an established classicist, Maurice Bowra. Paul Cartledge asserted in 1995, \\"... in retrospect Finley's work can be seen as the seed of the present flowering of anthropologically-related studies of ancient Greek culture and society\\".Cartledge, Paul. \\"The Greeks and Anthropology\\", Anthropology Today, Vol. 10, No. 3\\\\. (1994), p. 4 (available online). Following the example of Karl Polanyi, Finley argued that the ancient economy should not be analysed using the concepts of modern economic science, because ancient man had no notion of the economy as a separate sphere of society, and because economic actions in antiquity were determined not primarily by economic, but by social concerns. This text later came under scrutiny, with varied criticism coming from, amongst others, Kevin Greene, who argues that Finley underplays the importance of technological innovation, and C. R. Whittaker, who rejects the concept of a \\"consumer city\\".  Marriage and death  In 1932 Finley married Mary (, who later changed to her mother's surname, Thiers), a schoolteacher, and the two enjoyed a happy and mutually reinforcing marriage.

History Fonthill Castle was the home of the archaeologist and tile maker Henry Chapman Mercer. Built between 1908 and 1912, it is an early example of poured-in-place concrete and features 44 rooms, over 200 windows, 18 fireplaces, 10 bathrooms and one powder room. The interior was originally painted in pastel colors, but age and sunlight have all but eradicated any hint of the former hues. One room in the Terrace Pavilion (built on the site of the former home's barn), has a restored paint job so visitors can view the home's former glory. The castle contains built-in furniture and is embellished with decorative tiles, made by Mercer at the height of the Arts and Crafts movement. The castle is filled with an extensive collection of ceramics embedded in the concrete of the house, as well as other artifacts from his world travels, including cuneiform tablets discovered in Mesopotamia dating back to over 2300 BCE. The home also contains around 1,000 prints from Mercer's extensive collection, as well as over six thousand books, almost all of which were annotated by Mercer himself. The Castle was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, and was later included in a National Historic Landmark District along with the Moravian Pottery and Tile Works and the Mercer Museum. These three structures are the only poured-in- place concrete structures built by Mercer. The Moravian Pottery and Tile Works is located on the same property as Fonthill Castle, and the Mercer Museum is located about a mile away. Fonthill Castle and the Mercer Museum are operated by the Bucks County Historical Society, whereas the Moravian Pottery and Tile Works is operated by the County of Bucks.  Visiting  Fonthill Castle is open seven days a week for guided one-hour tours. Due to its historic nature, Fonthill Castle has limited accessibility with steep stairs and narrow, uneven passages throughout the site. Personal photography is permitted during tours; commercial, wedding, or event photography permits are available. Community Programs Throughout the year, community programs are held at Fonthill Castle as enrichment activities and/or fundraisers for the Bucks County Historical Society. These events have included Winter Wonderland Tours, Shakespeare in the Park, Candlelight Holiday Tours, Tower Tours for Families, Mercer's Night Tales, Behind the Scenes Tours, Escape Rooms, etc. Popular culture The house is featured (by name and description) in Lewis Shiner's 1990 novel Slam, although in the book it has been relocated to Galveston, Texas. On the Viva La Bam Seasons 2 & 3 DVD, it is revealed that Bam Margera shot the video for \\"And Love Said No\\" by HIM at Fonthill Castle. In 2007, Margera filmed parts of Minghags at the Fonthill Castle.

He was best known as the chief executioner of Emperor Nicholas II of Russia, his family, and four retainers on the night of 17 July 1918. Biography =Early life= Yakov Mikhailovich Yurovsky was the eighth of ten children born to Mikhail Yurovsky, a glazier, and his wife Ester Moiseevna (1848-1919), a seamstress. He was born on in the Siberian city of Tomsk, Russia. The Yurovsky family were Jewish. The historian Helen Rappaport writes that the young Yurovsky studied the Talmud in his early youth, while the family seems to have later attempted to distance themselves from their Jewish roots; this may have been prompted by the prejudice toward Jews frequently exhibited in Russia at the time.Rappaport, Helen. The Last Days of the Romanovs: Tragedy at Ekaterinburg. , . New York: St. Martin's Press, 2009. p. 32. Shortly before fully devoting himself to the cause of revolution, in the early twentieth century, Yurovsky converted to Lutheranism. A watchmaker by trade, he lived for a short time in the German Empire in 1904. After returning to Russia during the Russian Revolution of 1905, he joined the Bolsheviks. He received the party ticket no.1500 in the Krasnopresnenskaya organization. Arrested several times over the years, he became a devoted Marxist. He was a Chekist for a short period of time in 1917. =Execution of the imperial family= On the night of 16/17 July 1918, a squad of Bolshevik secret police (Cheka), led by Yurovsky, executed Russia's last emperor, Nicholas II, along with his wife Alexandra, their four daughters-Olga, Tatiana, Maria, and Anastasia-and son Alexei. Along with the family, four members of the imperial household (court physician Eugene Botkin, chambermaid Anna Demidova, cook Ivan Kharitonov and footman Alexei Trupp) were also killed. All were shot in a half-cellar room (measured to be 25 feet x 21 feet) of the Ipatiev House in Yekaterinburg, a city in the Ural Mountains region, where they were being held prisoner. The firing squad comprised three local Bolsheviks and seven soldiers. It has been documented that the order to assassinate the imperial family came from Yakov Sverdlov in Moscow and had been initiated by Lenin himself. It is also well documented that Yurovsky had visited the Bolshevik leadership in Moscow, and notably Sverdlov, only a few weeks before the killing took place. To prevent the development of a personality cult of the former imperial family, the corpses were stripped and dismembered; then taken to the countryside, where they were initially thrown into an abandoned mineshaft. The following morning, when rumours spread in Yekaterinburg regarding the disposal site, Yurovsky removed the bodies. When the vehicle carrying the bodies broke down on the way to the next chosen site, he made new arrangements and threw the bodies into a pit on Koptyaki Road, a since-abandoned cart track 12 miles north of Yekaterinburg, and doused the dismembered remains with sulfuric acid then burned them with gasoline before finally sealing the pit with concrete. = Post-Civil War = During and after the Russian Civil War, Yurovsky worked as a head of local Cheka in Moscow, then a member of Vyatka Cheka, head of Yekaterinburg Cheka (1919). In 1921, he worked in the Rabkrin and became Chief of the Gold Department of the Soviet State Treasury. Yurovsky achieved a solid reputation by combating corruption and theft. He also worked in management at the Polytechnical Museum starting in 1928 and became its director in 1930. He died in 1938 of a peptic ulcer. Yurovsky was survived by a wife, two sons, and a daughter. In 1920, a British officer who met Yurovsky alleged he was remorseful over his role in the execution of the Romanovs.Yakov Yurovsky, a biographical sketch adapted from In popular culture The character of Yakov Yurovsky appeared in several historical films dealing with the execution of the Russian imperial family. In 1971 British epic Nicholas and Alexandra, Yurovsky was depicted much older than 40 (his real age in 1918), as he was played by 65-year-old Alan Webb. In the 1991 Russian film Tsareubiytsa, Yurovsky was portrayed by Malcolm McDowell. In the 2019 American docudrama The Last Czars, Yurovski was portrayed by Duncan Pow.

Life Quinton was born at 5, Seaton Road, Gillingham, Kent, the only son of Royal Navy surgeon captain Richard Frith Quinton (1889‚Äì1935) and his wife (Gwenllyan) Letitia (n√©e Jones).https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-103164 A fellow of All Souls, he became a Fellow of New College, Oxford, in 1955. He was President of Trinity College, Oxford, from 1978 to 1987. Quinton was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1975 to 1976. He was chairman of the board of the British Library from 1985 to 1990. On 7 February 1983, he was created a life peer as Baron Quinton, of Holywell in the City of Oxford and County of Oxfordshire. To BBC Radio audiences, Quinton became well known as a presenter of the long-running Round Britain Quiz. Metaphysics In the debate about philosophical universals, Quinton defended a variety of nominalism that identifies properties with a set of \\"natural\\" classes. David Malet Armstrong has been strongly critical of natural class nominalism: Armstrong believes that Quinton's 'natural' classes avoid a fairly fundamental flaw with more primitive class nominalisms, namely that it has to assume that for every class you can construct, it must then have an associated property. The problem for the class nominalist according to Armstrong is that one must come up with some criteria to determine classes that back properties and those which just contain a collection of heterogeneous objects. Quinton's version of class nominalism asserts that determining which are the natural property classes is simply a basic fact that is not open to any further philosophical scrutiny. Armstrong argues that whatever it is which picks out the natural classes is not derived from the membership of that class, but from some fact about the particular itself. While Quinton's theory states that no further analysis of the classes is possible, he also says that some classes may be more or less natural‚Äîthat is, more or less unified than another class. Armstrong illustrates this intuitive difference Quinton is appealing to by pointing to the difference between the class of coloured objects and the class of crimson objects: the crimson object class is more unified in some intuitive sense (how is not specified) than the class of coloured objects. In Quinton's 1957 paper, he sees his theory as a less extreme version of nominalism than that of Willard van Orman Quine, Nelson Goodman and Stuart Hampshire.

He is viewed as a charismatic speaker, enamoring many Muslims, radiating a certain magnetism in his oratory. He spent much of his career in opposition to the Bathist government, and he spent many years in exile, particularly in Bahrain. al-Modarresi returned to Iraq following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and administers humanitarian projects in there.  Family  al-Modarresi was born into a distinguished Shia religious family in Karbala in Iraq. His father is Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad-Kadhim al-Modarresi, the grandson of grand Ayatollah Sayyid Muhammad- Baqir Golpayegani (also known as Jorfadiqani). His mother is the daughter of grand Ayatollah Sayyid Mahdi al-Shirazi. He claims descent from Zayd ibn Ali (died c. 740 AD), the great-great-grandson of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad.  Biography  = Early life = al-Modarresi began his religious education in the religious seminaries of Karbala, at the age of thirteen. He actively sought his religious studies under the auspices of many high ranking scholars, such as Sheikh Hasan al-A'lami, Sheikh Muhammad al-Karbassi, Shaykh Jafar al- Rushti, Shaykh Muhamamd-Husayn al-Mazindarani and his uncles, Sayyids Muhammad, Hassan and Sadiq al-Shirazi. In the late sixties, he and his uncle, Mujtaba al-Shirazi, attended the class of Sayyid Ruhollah Khomeini, and became one of his closest students. He completed the advanced level of his religious education in his early twenties. = Bathist opposition = al-Modarresi's advocacy of political freedom and strong stance against terrorism started from an early age when Saddam Hussein took power in Iraq. Seventeen members of his wife's family‚Äìal-Qazwini‚Äìwere executed by Saddam's regime or simply disappeared in the notorious Bathist penitentiaries. al-Modarresi wrote the first book to openly attack the regime, published by a religious scholar. Published under a pseudonym in Beirut, the book was titled No To Rulers of Iraq and sparked a massive political crisis in Baghdad and caused the Bathist regime to issue an ultimatum for the removal of all Lebanese nationals from Iraq within 72 hours. al-Modarresi eluded execution by moving from house to house, often living in cellars for months and traveling in disguise. When his uncle, Hasan was imprisoned, and the pressures of the Bathists anti-Shia sentiment peaked, al-Modarresi left Iraq in 1970, for Lebanon, and then briefly joined his brother Muhammad-Taqi, in Kuwait. = Bahraini leadership = In 1973, he emigrated to Bahrain, and exercised his religious activism there. In 1974, he was granted Bahraini citizenship. In Bahrain, al-Modarresi rose to national prominence, and was awarded with power of representation from grand religious authorities such as Muhammad al-Shirazi, Ruhollah Khomeini, Shihab al-Din al-Marashi, and Abd al-A'la al-Sabziwari, being labelled as a scholar \\"worthy of taking a leadership position\\" and urging Muslims to follow his lead. In 1979, the Bahraini authorities placed a travel ban on al- Modarresi, after his organisation, the Islamic Front for Liberation of Bahrain (a branch of his brother's (Muhammad-Taqi) larger risali movement), was announced in the press, being dubbed as an organisation that wanted to import the Iranian revolution into Bahrain, and pointing the finger at al-Modarresi, as its leader. In August of that year, he was kidnapped by the Bahraini intelligence and locked up in a car for up to fourteen hours. However, there was an international uproar, with the interference of some of the Islamic republic's senior leaders, and Yasser Arafat personally, that pressured the Bahraini government to release him, and send him over to Iran, with an apology. =Exile in Iran= Whilst in Iran, al-Modarresi continued his activism and kept supporting the Bahraini population against the Al Khalifah regime. The IFLB came to prominence as the front organisation for the 1981 coup, which attempted to install al-Modarresi as the spiritual leader of a newly established theocratic Shia state. However the coup failed, and so al- Modarresi reorganised the structure of the Front, focusing on its information efforts in Europe. al-Modarresi became a founding member of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI), and was among the active figures of the Iraqi opposition in exile. He was closely involved in efforts to expose and bring down the regime in Baghdad. He managed to escape a number of assassination attempts abroad, including one in Brazil in 1991 as well as two more attempts in Syria, by the Bathist intelligence operatives, in 2001. = Return to Iraq = Upon returning to Iraq after the fall of Saddam's regime, he was greeted by over thirty thousand people in Baghdad, fifty thousand in Sadr City and a similar crowd in his hometown, Karbala. al- Modarresi established a television station upon his return to his hometown. He is also involved in several large-scale humanitarian projects in Iraq and has been involved in the building of mosques, schools, medical clinics, orphanages, and has been a staunch advocate of women's rights and consistently speaks out against the oppression of women in his lectures and books. He also facilitates marriage by providing financial help to people who wish to get married and has organized several large mass marriage ceremonies. sl-Modarresi also founded and currently heads the League of Religious Scholars which brings together many high ranking Shi‚Äôite scholars or their representatives in Iraq.  Personal life  al-Modarresi is married to the daughter of prominent scholar, Hashim al-Qazwini (d. 2009), the elder brother of Murtadha al- Qazwini. He has five sons (Mahdi, Muhammad-Ali, Mustafa, Husayn and Muhammad- Kadhim). All of his sons are clerics. = COVID-19 = During the outbreak of the COVID-19, al-Modarresi expressed the opinion that the virus was a signal of Godly punishment for the Chinese population, because of the foods they consume, that are deemed Islamically unlawful, as well as their mistreatment of the Uighur Muslims. However al-Modarresi did clarify in his speech, that despite the disease affecting a specific nation [at the time of the statement], all nations must cooperate and not take advantage of the disease for political gain, because the disease can still affect us all, hence we must all work collectively to treat this virus, and that this is the responsibility of the entire world. In March 2020, al-Modarresi contracted the virus, but has since recovered and reported to be in good health.  Works  al-Modarresi has authored more than 250 books. Some of his books were published under different pen names such as 'Muhammad Hadi' and 'Abdallah al-Hashimi, and 'Muhammad al-Amin Association'.

Development The RWD 2 was constructed by the RWD team of Stanis≈Çaw Rogalski, Stanis≈Çaw Wigura and Jerzy Drzewiecki in the Aviation Section of Mechanic Students' Club of Warsaw University of Technology. It was a development of their first design RWD-1. Its feature was a unique, fish-shaped fuselage, with good aerodynamics, but without a direct view forward from the pilot's seat. For this reason, they were later nicknamed: blind mice. The first prototype (registration SP-ACE) was completed and flown by the designer Jerzy Drzewiecki in July 1929. Since it appeared successful in sports flying, three more RWD-2s were built in 1930 (registration SP-ADJ, -ADG, -ADH). Use In August‚ÄìSeptember 1929, Franciszek ≈ªwirko and Stanis≈Çaw Wigura flew the prototype across Europe, on the 5000 km Warsaw-Paris-Barcelona-Warsaw route (it was the first long foreign raid of the Polish-designed aircraft). On 16 October, 1929, ≈ªwirko and Antoni Kocjan set an international FAI altitude record of 4,004 m (13,133 ft) in the light tourist plane class (below 280 kg / 616 lb empty weight). Three serial aircraft took part in the Challenge 1930 international touring planes competition in July 1930. Stanis≈Çaw P≈Çonczy≈Ñski took the 19th place, as the best Pole (for 35 qualified and 60 starting crews), and Edward Wiƒôckowski took the 21st place (the third J√≥zef Mu≈õlewski was disqualified due to time exceeding, but he completed the rally off the contest). In the Challenge, RWD-2s won the trial of lowest fuel consumption (5.2 kg / 100 km). According to Flight, they \\"appear to possess particularly good air-sailing qualities\\".Flight, August 8, 1930, p.890 RWD 2s were also used in several Polish air competitions and other minor international ones, with some success.

It was organized as a competitor to the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad, but was soon taken over by that company. History Map of the Water Level Routes of the New York Central Railroad (purple), West Shore Railroad (red) and Erie Canal (blue) A West Shore Railroad three-car train used third-rail electric power between Syracuse and Utica, N. Y., ca. 1911 The first part of the line was built as the Saratoga and Hudson River Railroad, incorporated April 16, 1864, and opened in Spring 1866. After only about a year of independent operation, the line served as a branch of the New York Central Railroad (NYC), splitting at Athens Junction near Schenectady and running southeast and south along the west side of the Hudson River to Athens, New York. Early plans included acquiring the Saratoga and Schenectady Railroad as a northern extension. The Saratoga and Hudson River was bought and merged into the New York Central as their Athens Branch on September 9, 1867. The terminal at Athens was destroyed by fire in 1876. The line ran intermittently from then into the 1880s, with its tracks being torn up for good in 1888. It had been called the \\"White Elephant\\" Railroad for most of its existence because it quickly outlived whatever usefulness it may have had. Today a row of brick houses known as the Brick Row Historic District which was built in 1850 for the workers of the failed railroad stand in Athens as the only remaining structure related to the \\"White Elephant\\" Railroad project. Ferries departing Weehawken Terminal, c. 1900 At the south end of the route, the Ridgefield Park Railroad was incorporated April 4, 1867. This was planned as a branch of the New Jersey Rail Road, splitting at Marion Junction and running north on the west side of the New Jersey Palisades via Ridgefield Park to the state line at Tappan, New York. Across the state line, the Rockland Central Railroad was incorporated May 23, 1870, to continue the line to Haverstraw, and the Rockland Central Extension Railroad, incorporated May 29, 1872, was to continue further north along the west side of the Hudson River. The Rockland Central and Rockland Central Extension merged on July 29, 1872, to form a new Rockland Central Railroad, and that company merged with the Ridgefield Park to form the Jersey City and Albany Railroad on June 24, 1873, with the intention of building a full line from Jersey City to Albany. The line first opened in 1872 as a spur of the New Jersey Midland Railway, which had built the section south of Ridgefield Park. At that time, the northern terminus was at Tappan; the extension north to Haverstraw, New York, opened in 1879. Bankruptcy struck soon, and the New York section of the line was sold on September 28, 1877, and reorganized October 12, 1878, as the Jersey City and Albany Railway. The part in New Jersey was sold August 17, 1878, and reorganized with the same name, and the two companies merged in January 1879 to form a consolidated Jersey City and Albany Railway. The North River Railway was incorporated April 3, 1880, to extend the line north to Albany with a branch to Schenectady and a connection to the New York, Ontario and Western Railway (O&W;) at Cornwall, New York. The North River Railway was consolidated with the Jersey City and Albany on May 5, 1881, to form the North River Railroad, again forming a single planned line between Jersey City and Albany. The Hudson River West Shore Railroad was incorporated February 16, 1867, and the West Shore Hudson River Railroad was incorporated October 28, 1867, absorbing the Hudson River West Shore on February 16, 1867. This was a second proposed line on the west shore of the river from New Jersey to Albany. The New York, West Shore and Chicago Railroad was incorporated July 13, 1870, and absorbed the West Shore Hudson River on July 21, 1877, with a planned line not only to Albany but then west along the south bank of the Mohawk River to Buffalo. That company was sold and reorganized as the New York, West Shore and Buffalo Railway on February 18, 1880, and on June 14, 1881, the North River Railroad was merged into it, forming one company in charge of the whole route from New Jersey to Buffalo. thumb In 1883, the newly formed company inaugurated service from Newburgh and Jersey City at the Pennsylvania Railroad Depot, where passengers transferred to ferries across the river. A new alignment was built along the east side of the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway (formerly the New Jersey Midland) to North Bergen. By 1886, service operated to Weehawken Terminal through a tunnel under Bergen Hill that had been built in the three preceding years. The company leased the Athens Branch of the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad, the old Saratoga and Hudson River Railroad, and incorporated it into their main line between Coxsackie and Fullers. At Ravena, along the Athens Branch, the main line turned northwest towards Schenectady, while a new branch continued north to Kenwood Junction on the Albany and Susquehanna Railroad in Albany. This full line formed an immediate threat to the NYC monopoly. In addition to its owned trackage, the West Shore (WS) also had trackage rights over the Suspension Bridge and Erie Junction Railroad and Erie International Railroad, providing a route from Buffalo to Ontario. After the New York Central took over the West Shore, this was useless, as the New York Central had a parallel line, the Buffalo and Niagara Falls Railroad. The West Shore also had relations with the Boston, Hoosac Tunnel and Western Railway (BHT&W;), which would have run from the Hoosac Tunnel in Massachusetts west to Buffalo. Instead the BHT&W; built only to Rotterdam Junction west of Schenectady; it was later taken over by the Fitchburg Railroad. Bond of the West Shore Railroad Company, issued 16. January 1903 In 1881, the WS had been planned as a link in a new cross-country line from New York to San Francisco, using the Nickel Plate Road, Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway, Northern Pacific Railroad and Oregon Navigation Company. However, William Henry Vanderbilt of the NYC had bought the Nickel Plate in 1882, killing that plan. The NYC then proceeded to drive the New York, West Shore and Buffalo into bankruptcy. The Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) recognized that the WS would make a great addition to their system, allowing them to penetrate deep into NYC territory. At the same time, the NYC was building the South Pennsylvania Railroad across southern Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania Railroad's territory. The two railroads came to an agreement, where the NYC would buy the WS and stop building the South Pennsylvania (sections of which were later used for the Pennsylvania Turnpike). The NYC bought the New York, West Shore and Buffalo Railway on November 24, 1885, and reorganized their new acquisition as the West Shore Railroad on December 5, leasing it for 475 years from January 1, 1886. In many sections, the WS ran on a straighter path than the NYC, and was thus used for through freight. For instance, between Oneida and Utica, the WS followed the general line of the never-built Syracuse and Utica Direct Railroad, which had been merged into the NYC. Various connections (red) made the WS (orange) into a bypass of Albany and Schenectady =Named trains and route stations= Freight Schedule (no timetable authority) of New York Central's River Division on the eve of the Penn Central merger.

The line became part of Penn Central in 1968, and passed to Conrail in 1976 after Penn Central's bankruptcy. When Conrail was divided between CSX Transportation and Norfolk Southern, the West Shore Railroad, along with most of the old New York Central lines, became part of CSX. It became CSX's River Subdivision, which begins west of the Hudson Palisades at North Bergen Yard in Hudson County, New Jersey. Proceeding north it passes through Bergen County and Rockland County, New York, and up the west side of the Hudson River to Selkirk Yard, from which there are connections to points west and east. South of North Bergen Yard it connects to the Northern Running Track, part of Conrail. The tunnel under the Palisades is part of the Hudson Bergen Light Rail which emerges at the Hudson Waterfront at Weehawken Port Imperial. West Shore Regional Proposal Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, New Jersey Transit, the main provider of contemporary rail and bus service in the locale, expressed interest in potentially restoring passenger service to the line due to ever-increasing ridership on the local bus lines. In 1997, a $3.97 million grant was given to New Jersey Transit by the Federal Transit Administration. At the time, many towns along the line supported the idea, and went as far as conducting zoning procedures to allow room for the new additions the railroad would bring. Considering the current line is not under proprietorship of New Jersey Transit, a new right-of-way would be installed parallel to the existing freight line. However, funding remained an issue, as did disagreement with CSX. Ultimately, focus on the project was dropped in favor of progress on the Northern Branch Corridor Project and Meadowlands Rail Line (completed in 2009). An official status on the project has not since been noted.

The inhabitants are primarily members of the Igbo nation. It was the headquarters of the Ogoja province before the creation of the Southeastern State in 1967. Etymology The name Abakaliki originally means Aba Nkaleke and is the name of a community in Izzi land (Nkaleke). Economy Abakaliki, as in the past, is a center of agricultural trade including such products as yams, cassava, rice, and both palm oil and palm kernels,. It is also known for its local lead, zinc, salt, and limestone mining or quarrying. They host a golf course and many hotels. There are also isolated poultry and egg production farms across the state. History Abakaliki was an important center for the slave trade in the 17th century. The slave trade continued in the area with Aro raids into Abakaliki and surrounding areas through the 18th century. The Odozi Obodo Society was a secret cult that operated between 1954 and 1958 in Abakaliki. Old Abakaliki, ca.1910 Population The last known population of Abakaliki was 438,700 (year 2015).

Its location in front of Buffalo City Hall defines the center of Buffalo that all of the main roads converge on. The monument was commissioned by the State of New York and dedicated September 6, 1907 to the memory of William McKinley, 25th President of the United States, who was fatally shot while attending the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo on September 6, 1901. Daniel H. Burnham influenced the process of designing the monument by advising that a obelisk should be built in order to call to the importance and significance of the monument. A full restoration had occurred in 2017 as the result of environmental conditions compromising the integrity of the monument. Description The McKinley Monument consists of an obelisk of Vermont and Italian marble with marble lions surrounding the base. It was designed by architects Carr√®re and Hastings, who had led the design of the Pan-American Exposition, with animal sculptures by Alexander Phimister Proctor that include both sleeping lions (symbols of strength) and turtles (emblems of eternal life). The circular plot of land donated by the government of Buffalo, New York was 9 feet (2.7m) in diameter and was entirely filled with the base of the monument. Along with the donation of land, the sum appropriated for the project was approximately $100,000. An addition of $40,000 was expended on repairs of the surrounding neighborhoods. Corporations have spent over $30,000 to conform to the monument site. The commission to oversee the entire project was composed Edward H. Butler, John C. Milburn, General E. A. Curtis, and George E. Matthews. When the monument was fully constructed the base was 7 feet square with the height of 24 feet, while the obelisk extends 69 feet above the base. = Lion Sculpture = In 1905, a model of the four lions that would surround the base of the McKinley Monument was completed by Alexander Phimister Proctor, who was a very popular American sculptor at the time. Each one of the lions would be sculpted four times larger than an actual lion and made entirely out of white marble. These lions were modeled after Sultan, a veteran lion from the Bronx Zoological Park and weigh approximately 12 tons and are 12 feet long (3.7m). The combination of traditional architecture (obelisk) and wild animals was relatively new to American art, but was expressed within this monument. = Inscriptions = At the base of the column, the following inscriptions are found: > \\"This shaft was erected by the State of New York to honor the memory of > William McKinley, twenty-fifth President of the United states of America.\\" > \\"William McKinley was born at Niles, Ohio, January 29, 1843.\\" \\"Was enlisted > in Twenty-third Ohio Volunteers June 11,1865, as Major by brevet for > gallantry under fire.\\" \\"William McKinley was elected to Congress as a > Representative of Ohio in 1876, 1878, 1880, 1882, 1884, 1886.\\" \\"Was elected > Governor of Ohio in 1891 and 1893, and President of the United States in > 1896 and 1900.\\" \\"William McKinley died in Buffalo September 14, 1901.\\" > \\"Victim of a treacherous assassin who shot the President as he was extending > to him the hand of courtesy.\\" \\"The monument was built under the direction of > a commission composed of E. H. Butler and George E. Matthews of Buffalo; > John G. Milburn of New York, formerly of Buffalo, and at whose home > President McKinley died, and E. A. Curtis of Fredonia.\\"  Influence of Daniel H. Burnham  Architect Daniel H. Burnham had a major impact on the obelisk form of the McKinley Monument. He expressed his opinion on the type of monument to be built after being called in by Buffalo government officials. The location in Niagara Square in an already existing park posed some constrains to the monument. The tall buildings around the park along with the unknown expansion would call for a monument that commands attention but would still allow for the use of the park. This lead Burnham to the conclusion of an obelisk monument along with a pedestal base. According to Burnham, a fountain feature would be necessary in the monument but would be difficult to maintain in New York's harsh winters. He determined that the pedestal should have artistic value whether or not water was added to the architecture.  Dedication  The McKinley Monument was dedicated on September 6, 1907 to commemorate the assassination of William McKinley during the Pan-American Exposition in 1901 during the Old Home Week Celebration. The day of the dedication a heavy downpour occurred but an estimation of 100,000 observers came to remember a beloved president despite the rain. The ceremony began at 3:00PM with a parade of American and Canadian troops expressing international goodwill. Specifically the troops of two battalions of the Twelfth United States Infantry, the Sixty Fifth Regiment, the National Guard of New York, and Thirteenth Royal Canadian Regiment participated in the dedication. Governor Charles Evans Hughes spoke at the dedication of The McKinley Monument. He celebrated the people of democracy who dedicate themselves to public service, encouraging visitors to conserve the ideals that others had set and died for. Poet Carl Sandburg wrote a poem about the monument called Slants at Buffalo, New York, beginning: \\"A forefinger of stone, dreamed by a sculptor, points to the sky. / It says: This way! this way!\\"  Restoration Project  The McKinley Monument has been significantly affected by exposure to the elements for over a century, so a complete restoration occurred June 2017 to September 2017. The Flynn Battaglia Company was selected to restore the monument. They started by removing damaged marble blocks and replacing them with new blocks from the same quarry in Vermont. The paving stones and stairs were removed and reset in ground, stone poles were cleaned while two were replaced, and the fountains were relined to prevent leaking.

It has been open since antiquity and contains a large amount of graffiti. Contemporary plans of the tomb There are two known plans of the tomb's layout contemporary to its construction. One on papyrus (now located at the Egyptian Museum in Turin) provides a detailed depiction of the tomb at 1:28 scale. All of the passages and chambers are present, with measurements written in hieratic script. The papyrus plan also depicts the pharaoh's sarcophagus surrounded by four concentric sets of shrines, the same layout of shrines that were found intact within Tutankhamun's tomb. The other plan of the tomb was found inscribed on a slab of limestone not far from the tomb's entrance, and is a rough layout of the tomb depicting the location of its doors. The latter plan may have just been a \\"workman's doodle\\" but the papyrus plan almost certainly had a deeper ritual meaning, and may have been used to consecrate the tomb after it was built. Tomb layout A hieratic ostracon has been discovered mentioning the initiation of the tomb, its location selected by the local governor and two of the pharaoh's chief attendants in the second year of his reign. Ramesses IV ascended the throne late in life, and to ensure that he would have a sizable tomb (during what would be a relatively brief reign of about six years), he doubled the size of the existing work gangs at Deir el-Medina to a total of 120 men. Though sizable, KV2 has been described as being \\"simplistic\\" in its design and decoration.The Tomb of Ramesses IV, Valley of the Kings, Egypt, accessed July 15, 2009 The tomb was excavated at the base of a hill on the northwest side of the Valley of the Kings. Like other tombs of the 20th Dynasty, KV2 is laid out along a straight axis. The successors of Ramesses III from this dynasty constructed tombs that follow this pattern and most were decorated in a similar manner to one other. The tomb has a maximum length of 88.66 m and consists of three slowly descending corridors labeled B, C, and D. This is followed by an enlarged chamber (E), and then the burial chamber (J). Past the burial chamber lies a narrow corridor (K) flanked by three side chambers [Ka, Kb and Kc]. Isometric, plan and elevation images taken from a 3d model The tomb is mostly intact and is decorated with scenes from the Litany of Ra, Book of Caverns, Book of the Dead, Book of Amduat and the Book of the Heavens. The sarcophagus is broken (probably in antiquity), and the mummy was relocated to the mummy cache in KV35. Visits in antiquity The tomb was one of about eleven tombs open to early travelers. KV2 contains the second-highest number of ancient graffiti within it (after KV9), with 656 individual graffitos left by both Ancient Greek and Roman visitors. This tomb also contains around 50 or so examples of Coptic graffiti, mostly sketched onto the right wall by the entranceway, The tomb was likely used as a dwelling by Coptic monks, and there are also depictions of Coptic saints and crosses on the tomb's walls. Early European visitors to the area included Richard Pococke, who visited KV2 and designated it \\"Tomb B\\" in his Observations of Egypt, published in 1743. The savants accompanying Napoleon's campaign in Egypt surveyed the Valley of the Kings and designated KV2 as \\"IIe Tombeau\\" (\\"2nd Tomb\\") in their list. Other visitors of note included James Burton, who mapped out the tomb in 1825, and the Franco-Tuscan Expedition of 1828-1829, who did an epigraphic survey of the tomb's inscriptions. Modern archeological work Archeologist Edward Ayrton excavated the entranceway to the tomb during 1905/1906, followed by Howard Carter in 1920. Both of them found remnants of the materials which had originally come from inside the tomb, such as shabtis, numerous ostraca and fragments of wood, glass and Faience.

Roosevelt, 32nd president of the United States. Early life Roosevelt was born on July 16, 1828 in Hyde Park, New York to businessman Isaac Daniel Roosevelt and Mary Rebecca Aspinwall, sister of William Henry Aspinwall. Isaac's parents were businessman and politician Jacobus Roosevelt III and Catherine Welles. James' maternal grandparents were John Aspinwall and Susan Howland. In 1847, James Roosevelt graduated from Union College in Schenectady, New York. Career After obtaining a law degree from Harvard University, Roosevelt joined the law firm of Benjamin D. Silliman, the latter arranging Roosevelt serve on the founding board of directors to the company's client, the Consolidated Coal Company of Maryland. Doug Wead wrote that Roosevelt applied the skills he learned from watching the growth of this company to his own enterprise. Roosevelt's business interests were primarily in coal and transportation. He was vice president of the Delaware and Hudson Railway and president of the Southern Railway Security Company. During an 1853 trip to London shortly after his marriage, Roosevelt called upon United States Minister to the United Kingdom James Buchanan and accepted an invitation by Buchanan to serve as the minister's secretary at the embassy. Conrad Black wrote that this began the tradition of members of the Hyde Park Roosevelt family being affiliated with Democratic presidents. Following the 1863 death of his father, Roosevelt inherited both his wealth and status as patriarch of the family. Roosevelt purchased an estate that he bestowed the name \\"Springwood\\". In 1871, Roosevelt was elected town supervisor of Hyde Park and was pursued as a potential candidate for the New York state assembly or senate or Congress, requests that he turned down despite having an interest in politics. In the 1880s, Roosevelt donated to the New York gubernatorial campaign of Grover Cleveland and Cleveland's presidential campaign two years later. After the 1884 United States presidential election, in which Cleveland was elected president,, the Roosevelt family regularly met with the Clevelands in visits to the White House. Roosevelt was seen by the press as a possible appointee for a diplomatic appointee within the Cleveland administration, though he turned down these rumors. Roosevelt did contribute to his eldest son James being appointed to the post of First Secretary of the United States Legation in Vienna. Personal life Following graduation from Union College in 1847, Roosevelt traveled through Western Europe and the Holy Land before matriculating at Harvard Law School in 1849. In 1853, he married his second cousin, Rebecca Brien Howland, the sister of Meredith Howland. They had one son the next year, James Roosevelt \\"Rosey\\" Roosevelt, who married Helen Schermerhorn Astor. 1875 saw Rebecca's health falter as she demonstrated symptoms of heart disease and she was advised by doctors to stop climbing stairs, leading James to install elevators for her to use in both Springwood and their New York home. In August 1876, the couple traveled on James' yacht for a cruise to Long Island Sound, during which Rebecca experienced a massive heart attack when the pair were underway and died a short time afterward. Four years after Rebecca's death, he met a sixth cousin named Sara Ann Delano, daughter of merchant Warren Delano Jr., at a party celebrating the graduation of his distant cousin Theodore Roosevelt Jr. from Harvard University. James and Sara were married on October 7, 1880, and became the parents of Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1882, who married Eleanor Roosevelt. James reportedly was a caring father to Franklin, but his recurring heart problems eventually made him an invalid. Franklin reacted by becoming fiercely protective of his father. By the autumn of 1900, Roosevelt's health declined further after his yacht exploded and sank and the exploits of his grandson Tadd that included dropping out of Harvard prior to a disappearance that was proceeded by mocking from the press that also served to disillusion James. James died twenty years after he married Sara and left the bulk of his estate to her, and a modest inheritance to Franklin. He is buried at the churchyard at St. James Episcopal Church in Hyde Park; his grave is flanked by those of his wives. In popular culture Roosevelt is voiced by John Lithgow in The Roosevelts, a 2014 documentary series by Ken Burns. Legacy In 1927 Franklin and Sara Roosevelt donated money to the town of Hyde Park for the construction of a new library, named after James, and still in use today.

She described the war from within her upper-class circles of Southern planter society, but encompassed all classes in her book. She was married to a lawyer who served as a United States senator and Confederate officer. Chesnut worked toward a final form of her book in 1881‚Äì1884, based on her extensive diary written during the war years. It was published in 1905, 19 years after her death. New versions were published after her papers were discovered, in 1949 by the novelist Ben Ames Williams, and in 1981 by the historian C. Vann Woodward. His annotated edition of the diary, Mary Chesnut's Civil War (1981), won the Pulitzer Prize for History in 1982.

Life  Mary Chesnut was born on March 31, 1823, on her maternal grandparents' plantation, called Mount Pleasant, near Stateburg, South Carolina, in the High Hills of Santee. Her parents were Stephen Decatur Miller (1788‚Äì1838), who had served as a U.S. Representative, and Mary Boykin (1804‚Äì85). In 1829 her father was elected governor of South Carolina and in 1831 as a U.S. Senator. The family then lived in Charleston. Mary was the oldest of four children; she had a younger brother Stephen and two sisters: Catherine and Sarah Amelia. At age 13, Miller began her formal education in Charleston, where she boarded at Madame Talvande's French School for Young Ladies, which attracted daughters from the √©lite of the planter class. Talvande was among the many French colonial refugees who had settled in Charleston from Saint-Domingue (Haiti) after its Revolution. Miller became fluent in French and German, and received a strong education.Nomination for Mulberry Plantation National Park Service, accessed May 29, 2008 Leaving politics, her father took his family to Mississippi where he bought extensive acreage. It was a crude, rough frontier compared to Charleston. He owned three cotton plantations and hundreds of slaves. Mary lived in Mississippi for short periods between school terms but was much more fond of the city. Marriage In 1836, while in Charleston, thirteen-year-old Mary Boykin Miller met her future husband, James Chesnut, Jr. (1815‚Äì85), who was eight years her senior. At age seventeen, Miller married Chesnut on April 23, 1840.\\"Mary Boykin Chesnut\\", Encyclopedia of World History They first lived with his parents and sisters at Mulberry, their plantation near Camden, South Carolina. His father, James Chesnut, Sr. (whom Mary referred to throughout her diaries as the ‚ÄúOld Colonel‚Äù), had gradually purchased and reunited the land holdings of his father John. He was said to own about five square miles at the maximum and to hold about 500 slaves by 1849. In 1858, by then an established lawyer and politician, James Chesnut, Jr. was elected a U.S. Senator from South Carolina and served as such until South Carolina's secession from the Union in December 1860, shortly following the election of Abraham Lincoln. Once the Civil War broke out, Chesnut became an aide to President Jefferson Davis and was commissioned a brigadier general in the Confederate Army. The couple resided at Chesnut Cottage in Columbia during the Civil War period. Intelligent and witty, Mary Chesnut took part in her husband's career, as entertaining was an important part of building political networks. She had her best times when they were in the capitals of Washington, DC, and Richmond. She suffered from depression, in part because of her inability to have children, and would occasionally self-medicate with opium. The Chesnuts' marriage was at times stormy owing to their differences in temperament (she was more hot-tempered and sometimes considered her husband reserved), but their companionship was mostly warm and affectionate. As Mary Chesnut describes in her diary, the Chesnuts had a wide circle of friends and acquaintances in the upper society of the South and government of the Confederacy. Among them were, for example, Confederate general John Bell Hood, politician John L. Manning, general and politician John S. Preston and his wife Caroline, general and politician Wade Hampton III, politician Clement C. Clay and his wife Virginia, and general and politician Louis T. Wigfall and his wife Charlotte (also known as Louise). The Chesnuts were also family friends of Confederate President Jefferson Davis and his wife Varina Howell. Also among these circles were Sara Agnes Rice Pryor and her husband Roger, a Congressman. Sara Pryor, Virginia Clay-Clopton and Louise Wigfall Wright wrote memoirs of the war years which were published in the early twentieth century; their three works were particularly recommended by the United Daughters of the Confederacy to their large membership.Sarah E. Gardner, Blood And Irony: Southern White Women's Narratives of the Civil War, 1861‚Äì1937, University of North Carolina Press, 2006, pp. 128‚Äì130 Like many of the planter elite, the Chesnuts fell on hard times after the war. They lost 1,000 slaves as property through emancipation.A Belle of the Fifties: Memoirs of Mrs. Clay, of Alabama, Covering Social and Political Life in Washington and the South, 1853-66, New York: Doubleday, Page & Company, 1905, c1904, full online text available at Documenting the American South, University of North Carolina James Chesnut, Sr. died in 1866; his will left his son the use of Mulberry Plantation and Sandy Hill, both of which were encumbered by debt, and eighty-three slaves by name, who were by then freedmen. The younger Chesnut struggled to build up the plantations and support his father's dependents. By his father's will, James Chesnut, Jr. had the use of Mulberry and Sandy Hill plantations only during his lifetime. In February 1885, both he and Mary's mother died. The plantations passed on to a male Chesnut descendant, and Mary Boykin Chesnut received almost no income for her support. She also found her husband had many debts related to the estate which he had been unable to clear. She struggled in her last year, dying in 1886 at her home, Sarsfield, in Camden, South Carolina. She was buried next to her husband in Knights Hill Cemetery in Camden, South Carolina.Muhlenfeld (1992), pp. 218‚Äì19 Writing and the diary Mary Boykin Chesnut began her diary on February 18, 1861, and ended it on June 26, 1865. She would write at the outset: ‚ÄúThis journal is intended to be entirely objective. My subjective days are over.‚ÄùBurns, Ken. The Civil War: ‚ÄúThe Cause‚Äù, minute mark 42:00 and after. Chesnut was an eyewitness to many historic events as she accompanied her husband to significant sites of the Civil War. Among them were Montgomery, Alabama and Richmond, Virginia, where the Provisional Congress of the Confederate States of America convened; Charleston, where she was among witnesses of the first shots of the Civil War; Columbia, South Carolina, where her husband served as the Chief of the Department of the Military of South Carolina and brigadier general in command of South Carolina reserve forces; and again Richmond, where her husband served as an aide to the president. At times they also lived with her parents-in-law at their house at Mulberry Plantation near Camden. While the property was relatively isolated in thousands of acres of plantation and woodland, they entertained many visitors. Chesnut was aware of the historical importance of what she witnessed. The diary was filled with the cycle of changing fortunes of the South during the Civil War. Chesnut edited it and wrote new drafts in 1881‚Äì1884 for publication, and retained the sense of events unfolding without foreknowledge. She had the sense of the South's living through its time on a world stage, and she captured the growing difficulties of all classes of the Confederacy as the society faced defeat at the end of the war. Politically aware, Chesnut analyzed and portrayed the various classes of the South through the years of the war, providing a detailed view of southern society and especially of the mixed roles of men and women. She was forthright about the complex and fraught situations related to slavery, particularly the abuses of women's sexuality and the power exercised by white men. For instance, Chesnut discussed the problem of white planters' fathering mixed-race children with enslaved women within their extended households. Examination of Mary Chesnut's papers has revealed the history of her development as a writer and of her work on the diary as a book. Before working to revise her diary as a book in the 1880s, Chesnut wrote a translation of French poetry, essays, and a family history. She also wrote three full novels that she never published: The Captain and the Colonel, completed about 1875; and Two Years of My Life, finished about the same time. She finished most of a draft of a third long novel, called Manassas. Elisabeth Muhlenfeld, who edited the first two novels for publication by the University of Virginia Press in 2002 and wrote a biography of Chesnut, described them as her writing \\"apprenticeship.\\"Chesnut, Mary Boykin, Two Novels, Elisabeth Muhlenfeld, ed., University of Virginia Press, 2002. Chesnut used her diary and notes to work toward a final version in 1881‚Äì1884. Based on her drafts, historians do not believe she was finished with her work. Because Chesnut had no children, before her death she gave her diary to her closest friend Isabella D. Martin and urged her to have it published. The diary was first published in 1905 as a heavily edited and abridged edition. Williams' 1949 version was described as more readable, but sacrificing historical reliability and many of Chesnut's literary references. The 1981 version by C. Vann Woodward retained more of her original work, provides an overview of her life and society in the introduction, and was annotated to identify fully the large cast of characters, places and events. =Publication history= *1905: A Diary From Dixie.

Reception and legacy Chesnut's reputation rests on the fact that she created literature while keeping the sense of events unfolding; she described people in penetrating and enlivening terms and conveyed a novelistic sense of events through a \\"mixture of reportage, memoir and social criticism\\".Taylor, William R. \\"Mary Chesnut's Diary\\". New York Times, \\"Letters to the Editor\\" section, May 17, 1981. Critic and writer Edmund Wilson summarized her achievement: > The very rhythm of her opening pages at once puts us under the spell of a > writer who is not merely jotting down her days but establishing, as a > novelist does, an atmosphere, an emotional tone...Starting out with > situations or relationships of which she cannot know the outcome, she takes > advantage of the actual turn of events to develop them and round them out as > if she were molding a novel. Chesnut has had some detractors, notably history professor Kenneth S. Lynn, of Johns Hopkins University. He described her work as a \\"hoax\\" and a \\"fabrication\\" in a 1981 New York Times review of Woodward's edition of the diaries. Lynn argues that the diary was \\"composed\\" (rather than simply rewritten) in the 1881-84 period, emphasizing that Chesnut both omitted a great deal from the original diaries and added much new material: \\"She dwelt upon the personalities of people to whom she had previously referred only briefly, plucked a host of bygone conversations from her memory and interjected numerous authorial reflections on historical and personal events.\\"Lynn, Kenneth S. \\"The Masterpiece That Became a Hoax\\", New York Times, April 26, 1981. But, since neither Chesnut nor her later editors conceded that she had heavily revised her work, Lynn's view that the whole project is a fraud is a minority one. In 1982, Woodward's edition of Chesnut's diary won a Pulitzer Prize. A few years later, Ken Burns used extensive readings from Chesnut's diary in his documentary television series, The Civil War. Academy Award-nominated actress Julie Harris read these sections. In 2000, Mulberry Plantation, the house of James and Mary Boykin Chesnut in Camden, South Carolina, was designated a National Historic Landmark, due to its importance to America's national heritage and literature. The plantation and its buildings are representative of James and Mary Chesnut's elite planter class.  Notes  References *Chesnut, Mary Boykin.

The state change is a result of the free charge created by ionization in or close to an important node of a logic element (e.g. memory \\"bit\\"). The error in device output or operation caused as a result of the strike is called an SEU or a soft error. The SEU itself is not considered permanently damaging to the transistor's or circuits' functionality unlike the case of single-event latch-up (SEL), single-event gate rupture (SEGR), or single-event burnout (SEB). These are all examples of a general class of radiation effects in electronic devices called single-event effects (SEEs). History A single event upset in the flight computers of this Airbus A330 during Qantas Flight 72 on 7 October 2008 is suspected to have resulted in an aircraft upset that nearly ended in a crash after the computers experienced several malfunctions. Single-event upsets were first described during above- ground nuclear testing, from 1954 to 1957, when many anomalies were observed in electronic monitoring equipment. Further problems were observed in space electronics during the 1960s, although it was difficult to separate soft failures from other forms of interference. In 1972, a Hughes satellite experienced an upset where the communication with the satellite was lost for 96 seconds and then recaptured. Scientists Dr. Edward C. Smith, Al Holman, and Dr. Dan Binder explained the anomaly as a single-event upset (SEU) and published the first SEU paper in the IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science journal in 1975. In 1978, the first evidence of soft errors from alpha particles in packaging materials was described by Timothy C. May and M.H. Woods. In 1979, James Ziegler of IBM, along with W. Lanford of Yale, first described the mechanism whereby a sea-level cosmic ray could cause a single event upset in electronics. Cause Terrestrial SEU arise due to cosmic particles colliding with atoms in the atmosphere, creating cascades or showers of neutrons and protons, which in turn may interact with electronic circuits. At deep sub-micron geometries, this affects semiconductor devices in the atmosphere. In space, high-energy ionizing particles exist as part of the natural background, referred to as galactic cosmic rays (GCR). Solar particle events and high-energy protons trapped in the Earth's magnetosphere (Van Allen radiation belts) exacerbate this problem. The high energies associated with the phenomenon in the space particle environment generally render increased spacecraft shielding useless in terms of eliminating SEU and catastrophic single-event phenomena (e.g. destructive latch-up). Secondary atmospheric neutrons generated by cosmic rays can also have sufficiently high energy for producing SEUs in electronics on aircraft flights over the poles or at high altitude. Trace amounts of radioactive elements in chip packages also lead to SEUs. Testing for SEU sensitivity The sensitivity of a device to SEU can be empirically estimated by placing a test device in a particle stream at a cyclotron or other particle accelerator facility. This particular test methodology is especially useful for predicting the SER (soft error rate) in known space environments, but can be problematic for estimating terrestrial SER from neutrons. In this case, a large number of parts must be evaluated, possibly at different altitudes, to find the actual rate of upset. Another way to empirically estimate SEU tolerance is to use a chamber shielded for radiation, with a known radiation source, such as Caesium-137. When testing microprocessors for SEU, the software used to exercise the device must also be evaluated to determine which sections of the device were activated when SEUs occurred. SEUs and circuit design By definition, SEUs do not destroy the circuits involved, but they can cause errors. In space-based microprocessors, one of the most vulnerable portions is often the 1st and 2nd-level cache memories, because these must be very small and have very high-speed, which means that they do not hold much charge. Often these caches are disabled if terrestrial designs are being configured to survive SEUs. Another point of vulnerability is the state machine in the microprocessor control, because of the risk of entering \\"dead\\" states (with no exits), however, these circuits must drive the entire processor, so they have relatively large transistors to provide relatively large electric currents and are not as vulnerable as one might think. Another vulnerable processor component is the RAM. To ensure resilience to SEUs, often an error correcting memory is used, together with circuitry to periodically read (leading to correction) or scrub (if reading does not lead to correction) the memory of errors, before the errors overwhelm the error-correcting circuitry. In digital and analog circuits, a single event may cause one or more voltages pulses (i.e. glitches) to propagate through the circuit, in which case it is referred to as a single-event transient (SET). Since the propagating pulse is not technically a change of \\"state\\" as in a memory SEU, one should differentiate between SET and SEU. If a SET propagates through digital circuitry and results in an incorrect value being latched in a sequential logic unit, it is then considered an SEU. Hardware problems can also occur for related reasons. Under certain circumstances (of both circuit design, process design, and particle properties) a \\"parasitic\\" thyristor inherent to CMOS designs can be activated, effectively causing an apparent short-circuit from power to ground. This condition is referred to as latch-up, and in absence of constructional countermeasures, often destroys the device due to thermal runaway. Most manufacturers design to prevent latch-up, and test their products to ensure that latch-up does not occur from atmospheric particle strikes. In order to prevent latch-up in space, epitaxial substrates, silicon on insulator (SOI) or silicon on sapphire (SOS) are often used to further reduce or eliminate the susceptibility. Notable SEU In the 2003 elections in Brussels's municipality Schaerbeek (Belgium), an anomalous recorded number of votes triggered an investigation that concluded a SEU was responsible for giving a candidate 4,096 extra votes.

She was the mother of First Lady of the United States, Eleanor Roosevelt. Anna was described as a celebrated beauty. Early life Anna Rebecca Hall was born on March 17, 1863. She was the eldest of seven children born to Valentine Gill Hall Jr. and Mary Livingston Ludlow of the Livingston family. Their marriage \\"...united a member of a prominent New York merchantile family with Hudson River gentry\\". Anna was born in New York City and was a granddaughter of Edward Hunter Ludlow. Her brothers, Valentine III and Edward, were both tennis champions and, later, alcoholics who spent beyond their means and inheritances. Anna's four sisters were Elizabeth, Mary, Edith, and Maude. Her father died without leaving a will when Anna was 17, and she was forced to take control of the family and help manage the finances. Anna was one of the leading debutantes of the 1881 season. A prominent figure among the New York City social elite, she was a skilled horsewoman. It is believed that Anna and Elliott Bulloch Roosevelt, the brother of future President Theodore Roosevelt, became engaged Memorial Day, 1883, at a house party given by their friend, Laura Delano, at Algonac, the Delano estate on the Hudson River at Newburgh, New York. At the time, Anna was living at Oak Terrace, her family's estate far upriver at Tivoli, New York. Married life On December 1, 1883, she married Roosevelt in Calvary Church at Gramercy Park in New York City. The couple moved into a brownstone house in the fashionable Thirties. Anna bore Elliott three children: * Anna Eleanor Roosevelt (1884‚Äì1962) * Elliott Bulloch Roosevelt, Jr. (1889‚Äì1893) * Gracie Hall Roosevelt (1891‚Äì1941). Anna Roosevelt was responsible for numerous social events and charity balls. Her brother-in-law Theodore considered her frivolous. At the time of their marriage on December 1, 1883, Elliott was already known as a heavy drinker addicted to laudanum. Often subject to headaches and depressions, Anna was somewhat ashamed of her daughter Eleanor's plainness and nicknamed Eleanor \\"Granny\\", due to the child's serious demeanor. In the spring of 1887, the family sailed to Europe aboard the S.S. Britannic. One day out of port, their ship was rammed by the S.S. Celtic, the bow of which pierced a full ten feet into the side of the S.S. Britannic, killing several passengers and injuring numerous others. The Roosevelt party was evacuated to lifeboats before continuing their voyage aboard another ocean liner. Upon their return, Elliott commenced construction of his Long Island country residence, Half Way Nirvana. Parties at their estate included polo and riding-to-the-hounds. In 1889, after the birth of their second child, Elliott's drinking only increased, and the family traveled to Austria in search of treatment. After three months, they moved to Paris, where Anna's third child, a son, (Gracie) Hall, was born. The marriage teetered on collapse during their time in France. Soon afterward, Elliott and Anna separated. When Eleanor was eight, Anna contracted diphtheria and died at age 29 at her home, 52 East 61st Street in Manhattan. Elliott died at his home, 313 West 102 Street on August 14, 1894, from a seizure after a suicide attempt and the cumulative effects of alcoholism.Burns, Ken, The Roosevelts: An Intimate History, Public Broadcasting Service, Episode 1 (2015) The remains of both Anna and Elliott are interred in the Hall family vault at the cemetery of St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Tivoli. Anna's daughter Eleanor would go on to become First Lady of the United States when her husband, Elliott's fifth cousin Franklin Delano Roosevelt, became President of the United States in March 1933.

The school part of the Glendale Unified School District. History Glendale High School was founded as Glendale Union High School in 1901 by the residents of the villages of Glendale, La Crescenta, Burbank, Eagle Rock, Ivanhoe, Tropico and West Glendale. The first classes were held at the Glendale Hotel. The first principal was Mr. Llewellyn Evans and the school had of two teachers and 29 students. The next year, a new school building was built at the corner of what is today Brand Boulevard and Broadway. George Moyse was appointed principal and continued in his role for 35 years until 1937. The school continued to grow rapidly and the school moved several times, in 1907 to Harvard Street and in 1914 to Maryland Street. The school continued to grow, as enrollment reached 800 in 1920 and 1,050 in 1921. It was decided then to move the Grade 10, 11 and 12 classes to a new campus at the corner of the present-day Broadway and Verdugo Road (Grade 9 students remained at the Maryland Street campus, and were later integrated into area Middle Schools). The school has remained in this location (1440 East Broadway, at the southeast corner of Verdugo) since 1924.Glendale High School website: History . Retrieved March 10, 2016. The Class of 1960 was Glendale's largest, with 903 graduates. Crescenta Valley High School opened in September 1960, taking a sizable portion of Glendale's students. The school suffered extensive damage during spring break on March 22, 1964, when a student who was concerned about his grades set fire to the room in which he thought the grade information was stored. The fire quickly spread throughout the administration building and to adjacent buildings on the campus. The decision was made to reconstruct the campus, leaving the swimming pool, baseball field, tennis courts and football stadium as the only remnants of the old campus. In 1966, Captain Max Schumacher, an aerial traffic reporter for local radio station KMPC, landed his helicopter on the football field during a school assembly and spoke about traffic safety. He was later killed in a crash with a police helicopter near Dodger Stadium. In the early 1990s, the decision was made by the School Board to reintegrate ninth graders into the Glendale Unified School District high schools (with the exception of Crescenta Valley High School, which had already transitioned to a four-year high school in September 1983). As a result, the 'J' building was constructed in 1994‚Äì1995, opening in September 1995. In 2001, Glendale High School celebrated its centenary. The student population was then 3,500 and there were over 100 teachers.2001CRE807B GLENDALE HIGH SCHOOL 100 YEAR ANNIVERSARY ‚Äì gov.us.fed.congress.record.extensions  Google Groups.

In 2003, the program won another award, the Creative Ticket National School of Distinction Award from the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.. Glendale High School was the only public high school to be awarded this honor. On July 1, 2005, Katherine Fundukian replaced LeRoy Sherman and Lou Stewart as co- principals, as part of a School District decision to move Glendale High School back to a \\"traditional\\" one-principal system from the two-principal system that had been in place.

He was the father of First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and the younger brother of Theodore Roosevelt (1858‚Äì1919), the 26th president of the United States. Elliott and Theodore were of the Oyster Bay Roosevelts; Eleanor later married her Hyde Park distant cousin Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1882‚Äì1945), the 32nd President. Youth Elliott Roosevelt was the third of the four children of Theodore Roosevelt Sr. (1831‚Äì1878) and Martha Stewart \\"Mittie\\" Bulloch (1835‚Äì1884). In addition to elder brother Theodore Jr., he had a younger sister named Corinne (1861‚Äì1933) and an elder sister named Anna (1855‚Äì1931), who was known as \\"Bamie\\". Mittie's brothers Irvine (1842‚Äì1898) and James (1823‚Äì1901) were Civil War Confederate veterans who accompanied Elliott when he left Europe in 1892 to admit himself into an asylum in Virginia.Wilson, Walter E. and Gary L.

Along The Way: Two Paths from One Ancestry Xlibris Corporation, 2014Brogan, Hugh and Mosley, Charles American Presidential Families October 1993, page 568 At a young age, Elliott was academically more successful than Theodore; however, he eventually was surpassed by his older brother. This competition continued into the next generation with their own daughters. Elliott enrolled at St Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire in September 1875. He performed well academically though had to soon withdraw and return home after unexpectedly falling ill. Elliott maintained a charming and winsome personality all his life, which masked a growing drinking problem that started at a young age. Hunting trips to Texas In 1876 and 1877, young Roosevelt made two hunting trips into West Texas. The first journey ignited his interest in the wilderness. In his second trip, the 16-year-old Elliott was accompanied by a cousin, 23-year-old John Roosevelt. The two traveled first to Dallas and planned to hunt bison in the area between Waxahachie, Texas and Houston, Texas. They also intended to spend some time at Fort McKavett in Menard County. Once in Dallas, however, their plans changed after they met a group of other young men, one of whom was the sportsman Andrew Jameson, whose family made a fortune in Irish whiskey. These young men talked Elliott and John to go directly to West Texas to hunt bison. On January 2, 1877, the group of eight men left Dallas. By mid-January they were at a location just west of Graham, Texas where they listened to\\" the panther and wolves crying and howling\\" and kept their firearms within easy reach. Roosevelt wrote: ‚ÄúIt is a glorious free life,\\" so exciting that he did not grow homesick. The party passed through Fort Griffin, Texas, where they found in abundance bison, deer, antelope, quail, wild turkeys, and rabbits. When they cooked their game, the scent attracted unwanted guests of wolves and panthers. On February 3, Roosevelt entered into his diary: \\"[We] made our permanent camp at the bottom of a huge canyon by a fine water hole.‚Äù They were probably at the time in southern Crosby County, Texas, some 40 miles east of Lubbock, Texas. After 300 miles of travel, the party soon found hunting bison to be most hazardous. Elliott and John at one point faced a herd of bison stampeding toward them. They waited until the bison were in close range before they fired their weapons. A near fatal incident took place when Elliott was charged by a huge bull, which he had wounded. He barely could reload his rifle in time to fire a shot that struck one of the front legs of a bison. The animal crashed to the ground directly in front of Elliott. When raiders, either other buffalo hunters or the Comanche, stole most of their horses, they had to walk the 140 miles back to Fort Griffin. In other diary entries, Elliott wrote: \\"Trails bad-freezing night no water...Again only mud no water freezing hard...Fright ful [sic] thirst.‚Äù They reached Fort Griffin on George Washington's birthday and a week later returned to Dallas. Then, Elliott and John resumed their originally planned route. They were back in New York in late May 1877. Personal life Hall, Eleanor, and Elliott Jr., in 1892 On his father's death in 1878, Roosevelt inherited a fortune and lived the life-style of the idle rich by, among other pursuits, hunting tigers in India. On October 27, 1880, Elliott was Theodore's best man at Theodore's first marriage to Alice Hathaway Lee. In 1883, Roosevelt wed a rich debutante, Anna Rebecca Hall (1863‚Äì1892), the eldest daughter of Valentine Gill Hall Jr., and Mary Livingston Ludlow. The wedding was held on December 1, 1883 in Calvary Church in New York City. The couple had three children: * Anna Eleanor Roosevelt (October 11, 1884 ‚Äì November 7, 1962), called Eleanor * Elliott Bulloch Roosevelt Jr. (September 29, 1889 ‚Äì May 25, 1893), who died from scarlet fever * Gracie Hall Roosevelt (June 28, 1891 ‚Äì September 25, 1941), called Hall After this point, Elliott Sr. developed a \\"casual drinking\\" problem, which soon became alcoholism, an affliction to which his son Hall later succumbed. Due to his drinking problem, Elliott was exiled to Abingdon, Virginia, where he constantly wrote letters, mostly to Eleanor.

Theodore Roosevelt became the conservator for his spendthrift brother. Elliott fathered a son with Catherine \\"Katy\\" Mann (1862‚Äì1941),Genealogy a young servant girl employed by Anna. His brother sent a detective who specialized in likenesses to look at the child and subsequently the Roosevelts settled out of court for $10,000. The sum was placed in a trust, but according to the Manns the child never received a dime as the money apparently was looted by Katy's lawyers. There was some correspondence between Eleanor Roosevelt and her half-brother Elliott Roosevelt Mann (c. 1891‚Äì1976).H.W. Brands, T.R.

Its classification has not yet reached a satisfactory or stable state. Since the end of the 20th century, increasing availability of molecular phylogenetic data for this hugely successful radiation has led to several competing proposals for a taxonomic arrangement that correctly represents the relationships between the major lineages. Briefly, the disputes center on the fact that in old treatments (which were just as unable to reach a general consensus) the distinctness of some groups, such as the Arctiidae or Lymantriidae, was overrated due to their characteristic appearance, while some less-studied lineages conventionally held to be Noctuidae are in fact quite distinct. This requires a rearrangement at least of the latter family (by simply including anything disputed within it). This is quite unwieldy, and various more refined treatments have been proposed in response to it. While there is general agreement on what the basal families of Noctuoidea are, the more diverse advanced group may be treated as one all-encompassing Noctuidae, two huge and two smaller, or even (if Arctiidae or Lymantriida are kept distinct) more than four families, which are in some cases still quite sizeable. Recent developments There are several recent studies suggesting a radical change in the traditional family level classification. Recent works in redefining the families within the Noctuoidea has been carried out by Kitching (1984), Poole (1995), Kitching and Rawlins [1998], Speidel et al. (1996), Mitchell et al. (1997, 2000, 2006), Fibiger and Lafontaine (2005), Lafontaine and Fibiger (2006) and Zahiri et al. (2010). The Noctuoidea can be divided into two broad groups, those with a trifid forewing venation (Oenosandridae, Notodontidae and Doidae), and those with a quadrifid forewing venation (e.g., Arctiidae, Lymantriidae, Nolidae, Noctuidae). What has emerged from these investigations is that the quadrifid Noctuoidea form a monophyletic group. In 2005, Fibiger and Lafontaine arranged the quadrifid (forewing) group into several families, including the quadrifine (hindwing) Erebidae and trifine (hindwing) Noctuidae, based on evidence that suggested that the trifine noctuid subfamilies were derived from within the quadrifine subfamilies, so the family Erebidae would not be strictly monophyletic. Lafontaine and Fibiger in 2006 then redefined the Noctuidae to include the entire quadrifid group, believing the Arctiidae, Lymantriidae, and Nolidae to be derived from within this expanded concept of Noctuidae (and closely related to the subfamily Catocalinae). In essence, groups such as the Arctiidae, which had previously been treated as a separate family, were more closely related to groups within the Noctuidae than to non-noctuid families. In order to address this, a revised classification would have meant either recognizing over 20 (often weakly defined) families, or a single well-defined family with numerous subfamilies. The latter was adopted (Lafontaine and Fibiger 2006). More recent evidence from nuclear genes (Zahiri et al. 2010) confirms that the quadrifid (forewing) noctuoids form a monophyletic group, but also that this group can be further arranged into four monophyletic subgroups: 1) the quadrifine subfamilies; 2) the trifine subfamilies; 3) the Nolinae; and 4) the Euteliinae. Considering the massive size of the family, and the large number of subfamilies, tribes, and subtribes to arrange into a classification, Zahiri et al. (2010) chose the option of recognizing these four groups as families, namely Erebidae, Noctuidae, Nolidae, and Euteliidae, in addition to the basal trifid families. Systematics This follows Lafontaine & Fibiger (2006), with the additions of Thiacidinae Hacker & Zilli, 2007 and taxa in Micronoctuidae Fibiger, 2005. Note that the placement of Arctiidae, Lymantriidae and Nolidae as subfamilies of Noctuidae has been largely rejected by subsequent authors. An updated classification for North American Noctuoidea has recently been published (Lafontaine & Schmidt, 2010) and further changes are imminent for a global molecular review of the superfamily

EBS has more than 400,000 customers and distributes its products through a branch and franchised agency network. It handles direct business by telephone and the Internet. The institution's previous name was Educational Building Society, which reflected the role played by school teachers in its establishment, but \\"Educational\\" was later replaced by \\"EBS\\", forming a redundant acronym. History EBS Building Society was founded in 1935 by Alex McCabe and other teachers to provide affordable housing finance for teachers and other civil servants. EBS was one of the last two Irish building societies owned by their members but since July 2011, has been a subsidiary of AIB Bank. With 70 branches throughout Ireland, EBS offers residential and commercial mortgages, personal loans, savings accounts, investment products and a financial planning service. It formerly did not offer current accounts using its own resources and instead through an agreement with Allied Irish Banks, an ATM card service was operated using AIB's Banklink system. This has now been withdrawn and a debit card is provided in conjunction with MasterCard. Similarly, credit cards were formerly offered in conjunction with MBNA. EBS Logo 1991-2011 In the 2004 and 2005 \\"Ireland Great Place to Work\\" awards, EBS was named as the \\"Best Company to work for in Ireland with 500-1000 employees\\". In both these years, EBS was also named as one of the top 100 Best Places to Work in Europe. In 2006, EBS became a tied insurance agent of Irish Life, PLC for the provision of life and investments products. All investment products sold through EBS are managed by Irish Life Investment Managers. During 2007, a wholly owned subsidiary was established. Haven Mortgages focusses exclusively on the broker market as a separate lender in its own right. On 1 July 2011, EBS Building Society ceased to exist and, after being granted a banking licence, and demutualising, EBS Building Society became EBS Ltd., a subsidiary of AIB. On 12 September 2016, EBS Limited re- registered as a designated activity company (d.a.c.), as required under the Companies Act 2014. The registered name of the legal entity is now EBS d.a.c. EBS were the shirt sponsors of Sligo Rovers FC in 1994, in their treble winning season. Noticeably they beat Derry City in the FAI cup final, qualified for Europe and gave Club Brugge a run for their money. Emergency government rescue In June 2010, the European Commission authorised the Irish government to inject ‚Ç¨875 million as emergency rescue aid into the society to combat the post-2008 Irish banking crisis. This bailout money came with the demand that the EBS must submit a restructuring plan to the Commission.EU authorises ‚Ç¨875m EBS cash injection The European Commissioner for Competition, Joaqu√≠n Almunia, said \\"EBS needs a significant recapitalisation to comply‚Äîand to continue to comply in the coming years‚Äîwith capital requirement rules.\\" By March 2011 the total external bailout needed to save the institution was estimated at ‚Ç¨1.5 billion.

Life Zabarella was born into a noble Paduan family. He received a humanist education and entered the University of Padua, where he received a doctorate in 1553. His teachers included Francesco Robortello in humanities, Bernardino Tomitano in logic, Marcantonio Genua in physics and metaphysics, and Pietro Catena in mathematics. In 1564 he succeeded Tomitano in a chair of logic. In 1577 he was promoted to the first extraordinary chair of natural philosophy. He died in Padua at the age of 56 in 1589. His entire teaching career was spent at his native university. His successor was Cesare Cremonini. Work Title page of Opera logica (1578). Zabarella's work reflects his teaching in the Aristotelian tradition. His first published work was Opera logica (Venice 1578), followed by Tabula logicae (1578). His commentary on Aristotle's Posterior Analytics appeared in 1582. His great work in natural philosophy was De rebus naturalibus, published posthumously in 1590. It constituted 30 treatises on Aristotelian natural philosophy, the introduction to which was written only weeks before his death. His two sons edited his incomplete commentaries on Aristotle's texts, also published posthumously (the commentary on the Physics in 1601 and the commentary on On the Soul (1605).Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy Zabarella consulted newly recovered Greek commentators such as Alexander of Aphrodisias, Philoponus, Simplicius, and Themistius, as well as medieval commentators like Thomas Aquinas, Walter Burley, and Averroes. Unlike some earlier scholastic philosophers, he was literate in Greek, and was therefore able to use the Greek texts of Aristotle. He devoted much effort to presenting what he considered to be the true meaning of Aristotle's texts.

The company was founded in 1945 by Robert E. Rich, Sr., after his development of a non-dairy whipped topping based on soybean oil. Since then, the company has expanded its non-dairy frozen food offerings, and also supplies products to retailers, in-store bakeries, and foodservice providers. Rich's employs 11,000 employees worldwide, with manufacturing facilities in Brazil, Canada, India, China, Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States. The company sells more than 2,000 products in 112 countries. Rich's currently ranks number 116 on Forbes list of America's Largest Private Companies. In addition to Farm Rich, the company mostly sells products under other brands it has acquired, such as SeaPak; French Meadow, Casa Di Bertacchi; Byron's Barbecue; Carvel, f'real and Jon Donaire. CoffeeRich is one of the company's few exceptions; nearly all of its products are \\"sold not under the Rich brand name.\\" Company history =1940s= Rich's began in 1945, when Robert E. Rich, Sr., sought a replacement for dairy-based whip cream due to milk shortages during World War II. Through the use of soybeans, Rich created a cream that was less expensive than dairy-based whipped cream, yet lasted longer in the refrigerator and could \\"remain frozen for more than a year without degrading.\\" =1950s= In 1954, the company introduced the first commercial line of frozen √©clairs and cr√®me puffs, which are still produced today. =1960s= During the 1960s, Rich‚Äòs expanded further, introducing CoffeeRich, a non-dairy frozen creamer in 1961. The company also constructed a manufacturing plant in Fort Erie, Ontario, Canada the following year. This facility is now known as Rich Products of Canada, Ltd. The acquisition of Elm Tree Baking Co., in 1969, expanded Rich's offerings to include frozen baked goods. =1970s= The 1970s were also a decade of growth for Rich's, with the acquisition of nine new production facilities as well as SeaPak, a company based in St. Simons, Georgia, that produces frozen seafood specialties. In 1973, they bought the rights to renamed the Buffalo Bills stadium to Rich Stadium for $60,000 each year for 25 years ($1.5 million total).The 25 year stadium naming deal expired in 1998. It was named Wilson Stadium until 2016, when it became New Era Field. =1980s= In 1980, Rich's introduced Freeze-Flo, a process that allows foods to remain soft while frozen. The company introduced another product, On Top, a non-dairy dessert topping, in 1986, which was notable for its packaging ‚Äì a pastry bag with its own tip. Rich's also expanded its product line through the acquisition of Casa Di Bertacchi, a specialty meat and frozen pasta producer, in 1982, and Byron's, a barbecue and meat producer, in 1986. =1990s= During the 1990s, Rich's expanded internationally, opening facilities in Mexico, London, Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Australia, among others. In 1997 the company was described as a \\"20-plant, $1 billion global food- processing corporation.\\" =2000s= Since 2000, Rich's has acquired a number of companies to diversify its offerings. These include frozen dessert and bakery mix producer JW Allen & Co.,Buffalo Business First Jon Donaire Desserts, and donut producer Rolling Pin Manufacturing. Rich's integration of French Meadow Bakery and acquisition of World Catch LLC (all-natural seafood) and GLP Manufacturing (gluten-free baked goods) entered the company into the health and wellness food sector. In 2005, the company celebrated 60 years as a family-owned company with the \\"60 Delicious Years\\" worldwide birthday party on March 14. As part of the celebration, Rich's renovated lunch and break rooms at all of its manufacturing sites and launched an employee recognition program. With over 2,000 products sold in \\"more than 85 countries,\\" 2005 sales, worldwide, was $2.5 billion. =2010s= On August 23, 2013, Rich's celebrated the 50th anniversary of its Fort Erie, Ontario plant. On June 24, 2014, Rich's unveiled its new Innovation Center and Atrium @ Rich's. On 1 January, 2020, Richard Ferranti became Rich Product's new CEO.  Product portfolio  Rich's offers a diverse body of products, including: toppings and icings; sweet goods; finished desserts; appetizers; bread and rolls; pizza products; Italian specialties; barbecue; and shrimp and seafood.

Legal battles The dairy industry fought Rich's nondairy products, as it did over a century ago against margarine. As with the margarine battle, the fight was state by state, Some of the company's early-day advertising used the term \\"coffee whitener\\" rather than non-dairy. \\"1963.. in Baltimore ... Rich deliberately used the generic disclaimer coffee whitener rather than non-dairy creamer to avoid as much as possible stepping on the toes of dairy interests.\\" Rich Products was sued in 36 states, the founder's older son Robert E. Rich Jr. said. Eventually, his father's \\"court victories played an important role in legitimizing nondairy products.\\"  Sports  In 1972, Rich Products signed a 25-year deal for the naming rights to the Buffalo Bills' new stadium, then under construction in suburban Orchard Park. The Robert E. Rich family reportedly, at one point, suggested calling the stadium Coffee Rich ParkMost of the Rich Products Corporation's offerings are not crowned with the Rich company/family name. Coffee Rich, introduced in 1961, (at which point Pennsylvania claimed violation of state dairy labeling laws, section 235) was then/is perhaps the best known and longest existing one. See \\"History of Soy Ice Cream and Other Non-Dairy Frozen Desserts\\" , by William Shurtleff & Akiko Aoyagi (2013), p. 296 From 1973 to 1998 this stadium was known as Rich Stadium. This is one of the earliest examples of the sale of naming rights to a stadium in North American sports; it was for $1.5 million, or $60,000 per year. When the original deal expired in 1998 and Rich chose not to renew at a much higher rate, the stadium was renamed in honor of Ralph C. Wilson, the Bills' owner and founder (as of 2017, the stadium is now called New Era Field). Rich's also owns three minor league baseball teams, most notably the Buffalo Bisons, Triple-A International League affiliate of the Toronto Blue Jays. The other two teams are the Northwest Arkansas Naturals (Double-A affiliate of the Kansas City Royals), and the West Virginia Black Bears (formerly the Jamestown Jammers, the Single-A Short Season affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates). On November 4, 2010, Bob Rich announced that Rich Products shall be the official kit sponsor of the English Northern League Division One team Bedlington Terriers F.C. In 2013, Rich's Farm Rich brand became sponsor for Front Row Motorsports' David Ragan in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, and in its first race as sponsor, Ragan won the 2013 Aaron's 499 at Talladega Superspeedway; Farm Rich again served as Ragan's sponsor at Richmond International Raceway in the 2013 Federated Auto Parts 400. FarmRich came back on in 2014 to sponsor Ragan again for three races at Phoenix, Daytona, and Atlanta. FarmRich did not come back on in 2015.

The film was directed by Betty Thomas, with a screenplay by Laurice Elehwany, Rick Copp, Bonnie and Terry Turner, and stars Shelley Long, Gary Cole and Michael McKean. It also features cameos from Davy Jones, Micky Dolenz, Peter Tork and RuPaul, and the original cast of The Brady Bunch (except Robert Reed, who died in 1992, and Eve Plumb) in new roles. The film places the original sitcom characters, with their 1970s fashion sense and sitcom family morality, in a contemporary 1990s setting, drawing humor from the resulting culture clash. The Brady Bunch Movie was released in the United States on February 17, 1995, and grossed $46.6 million. A sequel titled A Very Brady Sequel was released on August 23, 1996, and a television film titled The Brady Bunch in the White House was aired on November 29, 2002. Plot Larry Dittmeyer, an unscrupulous real estate developer, explains to his supervisor that almost all the families in his neighborhood -- except for the Brady family -- have agreed to sell their property as part of a plan to turn the area into a shopping mall. At the Bradys' house, Mike and Carol are having breakfast prepared by their housekeeper, Alice, while the six children prepare for school. Jan is jealous of her elder, popular sister Marcia. Cindy is tattling about everything she's hearing. Greg is dreaming of becoming a singer (but sings folk songs more appropriate to the seventies). Peter is beginning puberty with his voice starting to break and the numerous titillations he is exposed to, notably sex education and his very attractive teacher Miss Linley. He is also trying to win the affection of the girl he loves, Holly, but his shy and awkward personality prevents him from doing so, or so he thinks. Bobby is excited about his new role as hall monitor at school. Cindy gives Mike and Carol a tax delinquency notice (which was earlier mistakenly delivered to the Dittmeyers) stating that they face foreclosure on their house if they do not pay $20,000 in back taxes. The two initially ignore the crisis, but when Mike's architectural design (which is exactly the same as their house) is turned down by two potential clients, he tells Carol that they may have to sell the house. Cindy overhears this and tells her siblings and they look for work to raise money to save the house, but their earnings are nowhere near enough to reach the required sum. Mike manages to sell a Japanese company on one of his dated designs, thereby securing the money, only for Larry to sabotage it by claiming that Mike's last building collapsed. On the night before the Bradys have to move out, Marcia suggests that they enter a \\"Search for the Stars\\" contest, the prize of which is exactly $20,000. Jan, having originally suggested this and been rejected, runs away from home. Cindy sees her leave and tattles, and the whole family goes on a search for her. They use their car's citizens' band radio, and their transmission is heard by Schultzy (Ann B. Davis), a long-haul trucker who picks up Jan and convinces her to return home. The next day, the children join the \\"Search for the Stars\\" contest. Peter finally builds the confidence to stand up to Eric Dittmeyer, Peter's tormentor and Holly's boyfriend, which earns him a kiss from Holly and turns him into a man. The children's dated performance receives a poor audience response compared to the more modern performances of other bands. However, the judges ‚Äî Davy Jones, Micky Dolenz, and Peter Tork of The Monkees ‚Äî vote for them, and they win the contest as a result. The tax bill is paid and their neighbors withdraw their homes from the market, foiling Larry's plan and securing the neighborhood. Later, Carol's mother (Florence Henderson) arrives and finally convinces Jan to stop being jealous of Marcia, only for Cindy to start feeling jealous of Jan.

Production The film was shot almost entirely in Los Angeles, California, with the Brady house being located in Sherman Oaks. The school scenes were shot at Taft High School in Woodland Hills. Some scenes were filmed at Bowcraft amusement park in Scotch Plains, New Jersey. The producers had sought to film the original house that had been used for exterior shots during the original Brady Bunch series, but the owner of the Studio City, California home refused to restore the property to its 1969 appearance. The filmmakers instead erected a facade around a house in nearby Encino and filmed scenes in the front yard. Release The Brady Bunch Movie was released in theaters on February 17, 1995. The film opened at #1 at the box office with $14.8 million and grossed $46.6 million in the U.S. and Canada. Its television debut was on NBC November 29, 1997 with additional footage not shown in theaters or on home video releases. The Brady Bunch Movie was released on DVD June 10, 2003 and April 25, 2017. The film has also been released digitally on Google Play. Reception The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 62% approval rating based on 42 reviews and an average rating of 5.7/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Though lightweight and silly, The Brady Bunch Movie still charms as homage to the 70s sitcom.\\" Leonard Klady of Variety wrote, \\"For five years back in the early 1970s, U.S. TV homes were in the thrall of The Brady Bunch. Two decades after their small-screen demise, the clean-cut crew is back in mythic form as The Brady Bunch Movie. Part homage, part spoof, the deft balancing act is a clever adaptation‚Äîalbeit culled from less than pedigreed source material.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, \\"The film establishes a bland, reassuring, comforting Brady reality ‚Äì a certain muted tone that works just fine but needs, I think, a bleaker contrast from outside to fully exploit the humor. The Brady Bunch Movie is rated PG-13, which is a compromise: The Bradys themselves live in a PG universe, and the movie would have been funnier if when they ventured outside it was obviously Wayne's World.\\" He and Gene Siskel also agreed that the film offers charmingly bright and silly set decoration but fails to deliver genuine laughs. Event occurs at 7:00-9:20. Common Sense Media said that \\"for those who grew up watching the TV show, The Brady Bunch Movie is deeply satisfying and the best part is its nostalgia. Sure, it's fun to see the Bradys treated as freaks. But the heart of the film is a campy, affectionate interpretation of the TV show.\\" Sequels =A Very Brady Sequel= A Very Brady Sequel, directed by Arlene Sanford, was released theatrically on August 23, 1996. It sees the family routine thrown into disarray when a man claiming to be Carol's long-lost first husband arrives on their doorstep. The family must then follow Carol to Hawaii in order to set things straight. All of the main cast members reprised their roles. =The Brady Bunch in the White House= The second sequel, The Brady Bunch in the White House, sees a convoluted series of mishaps end with Mike and Carol Brady elected as President and Vice President of the United States. Despite innocent efforts to improve the country, the Brady family is beset on all sides by controversy and imagined scandals which threaten to tear them apart. Although the original actors for Mike and Carol return, the children and Alice are all recast for this film, which was released as a filmed-for-television movie.

A psychiatrist is a medical doctor who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders (i.e. behavioural, cognitive and/or emotional disorders), and can thus prescribe medications in treating such disorders - as well as to provide psychotherapy and other supportive counselling. A clinical psychologist is not a medical doctor - but a licensed mental health professional (who usually holds a Master's or Doctoral degree in clinical psychology) who specializes in the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of mental disorders. S/he may provide psychological evaluation, assessment, testing, and treatment, but may not prescribe medications.

A voucher is a bond of the redeemable transaction type which is worth a certain monetary value and which may be spent only for specific reasons or on specific goods. Examples include housing, travel, and food vouchers. The term voucher is also a synonym for receipt and is often used to refer to receipts used as evidence of, for example, the declaration that a service has been performed or that an expenditure has been made. Voucher is a tourist guide for using services with a guarantee of payment by the agency. The term is also commonly used for school vouchers, which are somewhat different. In tourism Vouchers are used in the tourism sector primarily as proof of a named customer's right to take a service at a specific time and place. Service providers collect them to return to the tour operator or travel agent that has sent that customer, to prove they have given the service. So, the life of a voucher is as below: # Customer receives vouchers from tour operator or travel agent for the services purchased # Customer goes to vacation site and forwards the voucher to related provider and asks for the service to be provided # Provider sends collected vouchers to the agent or operator that sends customers from time to time, and asks for payment for those services # Uncollected vouchers do not deserve payment This approach is most suitable for free individual tourist activities where pre-allocation for services are not necessary, feasible or applicable. It was customary before the information era when communication was limited and expensive, but now has been given quite a different role by B2C applications. When a reservation is made through the internet, customers are often provided a voucher through email or a web site that can be printed. Providers customarily require this voucher be presented prior to providing the service. Account voucher A voucher is an accounting document representing an internal intent to make a payment to an external entity, such as a vendor or service provider. A voucher is produced usually after receiving a vendor invoice, after the invoice is successfully matched to a purchase order. A voucher will contain detailed information regarding the payee, the monetary amount of the payment, a description of the transaction, and more. In accounts payable systems, a process called a \\"payment run\\" is executed to generate payments corresponding to the unpaid vouchers. These payments can then be released or held at the discretion of an accounts payable supervisor or the company controller. The term can also be used with reference to accounts receivable, where it is also a document representing intent to make an adjustment to an account, and for the general ledger where there is need to adjust the accounts within that ledger; in that case it is referred to as a journal voucher. Any documentary evidence supporting the entries recorded in the books of accounts, establishing the arithmetic accuracy of the transaction, may also be referred to as a voucher--for example, a bill, invoice, receipt, salary and wages sheet, memorandum of association, counterfoil of paying-in slip, counterfoil of cheque book, or trust deed. Mobile phones A voucher is a recharge number sold to a customer to recharge their SIM card with money and to extend the card's availability period. Vouchers are typically sold at retail outlets, such as phone stores run by the mobile operator or by distributors, grocery stores, and gas stations. Vouchers are the prevalent form of recharge for prepaid mobile phones in many countries such as Italy and Spain where well over 90% of consumers use vouchers, and the UK where over 60% buy vouchers at retail.Time to Top-Up the Prepaid User Experience: How an effective top-up strategy can improve operator performance metrics and accelerate mobile payments. Northstream White Paper, June 2009 http://northstream.se/wp- content/uploads/2009/06/Prepaid_Whitepaper_Jun_2009.pdf In other countries such as the United States, Ireland, and many Nordic countries, there is a growing trend of customers using Card Not Present recharge options such as online payments, or by using their mobile handsets to call the operator and recharge with a representative (CSR) or through their IVR (Interactive Voice Response) system. A growing number of prepaid mobile operators such as Meteor in Ireland and T-Mobile USA are offering the option to send an SMS (text to pay), or use handset applications such as WAP or BREW technology. Internet A voucher can also be used online in the form of an e-voucher. These types of vouchers can be entered when shopping online and the relevant vouchers value added to your order. It can take the form of any code. Many companies have opted to use voucher codes for the last few years but with a massive incline in use towards late 2008 and early 2009. There are many Internet websites devoted to promoting these deals and vouchers online, as well as Facebook groups offering items such as student discounts and 2-for-1 restaurant voucher deals. Many companies have started their business around coupons. It comes under affiliate marketing There are a small number of sites that use a disreputable method of click to reveal method for dropping cookies on the consumer's computer, which has led to the introduction of guidelines for voucher use in Internet marketing. Most video game special editions come with a voucher for exclusive content in-game. Also, pre-ordering games at certain shops may entitle the purchaser to vouchers to content only available if you pre-order at that store.

She starred in at least 78 silent era motion pictures from 1913 to 1917, of which 66 were one and two-reel shorts. She is regarded as Hollywood's first Latin and Hispanic movie star actress.MeXicana encounters: the making of social identities on the borderlands By Rosa Linda Fregoso Gonzalez was best known for her role as Enid Maitland in Vitagraph's six-reel feature length drama The Chalice of Courage (1915) opposite William Duncan. A magazine writer once called her \\"The Virgin White Lily of the Screen.\\" Personal life Myrtle Gonzalez was born in Los Angeles, California on September 28, 1891, the daughter of Manuel George Gonzalez (1868-?) and Lillian L. Cook (1874-1932). Her siblings were Stella M. Gonzalez (1892-1965) and Manuel G. Gonzalez, Jr. (1898-?). Her paternal side comes from a native Hispanic Californio family of Mexico,MeXicana encounters: the making of social identities on the borderlands By Rosa Linda Fregoso while her maternal grandparents were born in Ireland. Her father was a retail grocer, her mother a former opera and popular singer. From early childhood, Myrtle displayed remarkable dramatic talent, and she had a good soprano voice. She appeared in many local concerts and benefits and sang in church choirs. She later played juvenile parts on the stage with Fanny Davenport and Florence Stone. Gonzalez's first marriage was to James Park Jones. They had one son together, James Parks Jones, Jr. (c. 1911-1917), before they divorced. Movie career Film avertisement in The Moving Picture World, 1916 Because she grew up in Los Angeles, the shift of movie production to her hometown was a big advantage for her. Gonzalez worked for such studios as Vitagraph and Universal. She appeared in five movies opposite William Desmond Taylor at Vitagraph, the comedy/drama Her Husband's Friend (1913), the drama Tainted Money (1914), the comedy Millions for Defence (1914), the drama The Kiss (1914), and the drama Captain Alvarez (1914). In many of her roles, Gonzalez typified a vigorous out-of-doors type of heroine. During the last six years of her career, many of the movies she starred in were stories of the snow country and of the forests. Personal life and death On December 1, 1917, she and actor/director Allen Watt (1885-1944) were married in Los Angeles.Los Angeles Times, Dec. 5, 1917, \\"Film Actress Bride Of Army Officer. --- Capt.

Watt, who was formerly an assistant director at Universal, where they met, was then in the U.S. Army and she returned with him to Camp Lewis, in Washington state. Her health was too frail for the climate, however, and Capt. Watt was placed on the retirement list so he could return her to Southern California. He went back to work at Universal and began directing. Gonzalez, at age 27, died during the worldwide Spanish flu pandemic of 1918.

Tropea is a seaside resort with sandy beaches, located on the Gulf of Saint Euphemia, part of the Tyrrhenian Sea, on Italy's west coast. History A legend suggests that the town was founded by Hercules when returning from his labours at the Pillars of Hercules (the modern-day Strait of Gibraltar). Graves of Magna Graecian origin have been found near Tropea. Along Tropea's coast, Sextus Pompey defeated Octavius. The Romans built a commercial port in Formicoli, approximately 3 km south of Tropea.

The painting is known as the Virgin Mary of Romania and is of Byzantine origin. An unconfirmed story asserts that it was carried aboard a ship sailing from the Eastern Roman Empire, when the boat was driven into the port of Tropea by a storm. After repairing the damage, the captain tried to depart, but the ship could not leave the harbour. The bishop of the city, Ambrogio Cordova, dreamed repeatedly that the Virgin Mary was asking him to keep her in Tropea and to protect her. The bishop gathered officials and citizens and went to the ship, where they took the picture. As soon as the painting was brought to shore the ship allegedly left the town. The Virgin Mary is said to have appeared to the bishop several times in his dreams, warning him of an earthquake that would devastate Calabria. On 27 March 1638 a bishop organised a penitential procession for the people from Tropea, which meant they were out of harm's way when the earthquake struck. Other events have been attributed to the Virgin Mary's protection, including Tropea being spared from the worst of the 1783 Calabrian earthquakes and when six bombs fell on the town in Tropea in the Second World War, but failed to explode.

It was historically used solely for the head of the Coptic Orthodox Church in Ethiopia during the more than 1000 years when the Coptic Patriarchate of Alexandria appointed only one bishop at a time to serve its Ethiopian flock. When referred to without a name following, it is Abun, and if a name follows, it becomes Abuna (e.g., Abuna Paulos).  History  Historically the Abun of the Ethiopian Church was appointed by the Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of All Africa, who had diocesan authority over Ethiopia and the rest of Africa, at the request of the Emperor and, in historic times, after paying a substantial fee to the Muslim government for the privilege. The Abun would be selected from the membership of the Monastery of Saint Anthony. Although several Abuns might be appointed at one time, a request in 1140 to appoint enough to consecrate a metropolitan was refused.Margery Perham, The Government of Ethiopia, second edition (London: Faber and Faber, 1969), p. 104 The candidate frequently lacked knowledge of the native language and even with the local customs of the Ethiopian church. As a result, most Abuns had a minimal influence on both Ethiopian religion and politics. His authority eventually was filled in ecclesiastical matters by the Ichege or Abbot of the Monastery of Debre Libanos in Shewa, the sole possessor of this particular title in Ethiopia. (This title is now customarily held by the patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church.) Visitors to Ethiopia at this time, such as Francisco √Ålvares in the 16th century and Remedius Prutky in the 18th century, were amazed at the mass ordination of deacons and priests with little more than a wave of the cross and a prayer, which was the Abun's principal duty. After many centuries, Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia, the last reigning Oriental Christian monarch in the world, reached an agreement with the Coptic Orthodox Church in Alexandria, Egypt, on 13 July 1948. This led to the promotion of the Church of Ethiopia to the rank of an autocephalous Patriarchate. Five bishops were immediately consecrated by the Coptic Orthodox Pope of Alexandria. They later elected an Ethiopian patriarch for their church following the death of Abuna Qerellos IV, the last Copt to lead the Church of Ethiopia.Perham, Government, p. lvii The first Patriarch of Ethiopia was Abuna Basilios, who was consecrated 14 January 1951. The current Patriarch of Ethiopia is Abune Mathias, who succeeded Abune Paulos who died on August 16, 2012. Syriac usage Abuna (Syriac: ‹ê‹í‹ò‹¢‹ê Abuna,  æab≈´nƒÅ, literally 'our father') is also a title used among Syriac Christians , Coptic Christians and Maronite Christians to refer to a priest. The title is used either by itself or with the priest's given name (for example, 'Abuna Tuma' for 'Father Thomas'). This title is not used in self-reference, rather the priest would refer to himself as al-Ab ( al- æAb, literally 'the father').

Description The protocol consists of little more than a Diffie‚ÄìHellman key exchange where the Diffie-Hellman generator g is created from a hash of the password. Here is one simple form of SPEKE: # Alice and Bob agree to use an appropriately large and randomly selected safe prime p, as well as a hash function H(). # Alice and Bob agree on a shared password œÄ. # Alice and Bob both construct g = H(œÄ)2 mod p. (Squaring makes g a generator of the prime order subgroup of the multiplicative group of integers modulo p.) # Alice chooses a secret random integer a, then sends Bob ga mod p. # Bob chooses a secret random integer b, then sends Alice gb mod p. # Alice and Bob each abort if their received values are not in the range [2,p-2], to prevent small subgroup confinement attack. # Alice computes K = (gb mod p)a mod p. # Bob computes K = (ga mod p)b mod p. Both Alice and Bob will arrive at the same value for K if and only if they use the same value for œÄ. Once Alice and Bob compute the shared secret K they can use it in a key confirmation protocol to prove to each other that they know the same password œÄ, and to derive a shared secret encryption key for sending secure and authenticated messages to each other. The use of a key confirmation protocol is optional, as specified in the IEEE P1363.2 and ISO/IEC 11770-4 standards. Unlike unauthenticated Diffie-Hellman, SPEKE prevents man-in-the- middle attack by the incorporation of the password. An attacker who is able to read and modify all messages between Alice and Bob cannot learn the shared key K and cannot make more than one guess for the password in each interaction with a party that knows it. In general, SPEKE can use any prime order group that is suitable for public key cryptography, including elliptic-curve cryptography. However, when SPEKE is realized by using Elliptic-curve cryptography, the protocol is essentially changed by requiring an additional primitive that must securely map a password onto a random point on the designated elliptic curve. (This primitive is called the IOP or Integer-to- Point function in IEEE P1363.2 and ISO/IEC 11770-4.) History SPEKE is one of the older and well-known protocols in the relatively new field of password- authenticated key exchange. It was first described by David Jablon in 1996. In this publication Jablon also suggested a variant where, in step 2 of the protocol, g is calculated as g = gqS with a constant gq. However, this construction turned out to be insecure against dictionary attacks and was therefore not recommended anymore in a revised version of the paper. In 1997 Jablon refined and enhanced SPEKE with additional variations, including an augmented password-authenticated key agreement method called B-SPEKE. A paper published by MacKenzie in 2001 presents a proof in the random oracle model that SPEKE is a secure PAKE protocol (using a somewhat relaxed definition) based on a variation of the Decision Diffie-Hellman assumption. However, the proof treats the key confirmation function in SPEKE as mandatory, which is not how SPEKE is specified in the IEEE P1363.2 and ISO/IEC 11770-4 standards. Since 1999, the protocol has been used by several companies in a variety of products, typically supplementing other cryptographic techniques. In 2014, two attacks are identified against the SPEKE protocol as specified in the original Jablon's 1996 paper and in the IEEE P1363.2 (D26) and ISO/IEC 11770-4 (2006) standards.F. Hao, S.F. Shahandashti. The SPEKE Protocol Revisited. Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on Security Standardisation Research, 2014. The first attack allows an active attacker to impersonate a user without knowing the password by launching two parallel sessions with the victim. The second attack allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to manipulate the session key between two honest users without being detected. The first attack indicates a practical weakness of the protocol while the second attack has theoretical implications on security proofs of SPEKE. During the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27 meeting in Mexico City in October 2014, the two attacks were discussed by the technical committee in ISO/IEC SC 27/Work Group 2, and it had been agreed that the SPEKE specification in ISO/IEC 11770-4 (2006) should be revised to address the identified issues. The proposed patch involves explicitly defining session identities, and including those identities into the key derivation function in a way that does not change the symmetry of the protocol. The patched SPEKE has been published in ISO/IEC 11770-4 (2017).https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:67933:en However, the SPEKE specification in IEEE P1363.2 remains unpatched. Patents describes several variations of the method. This patent expired in March 2017. Standards Standards that describe SPEKE include IEEE P1363.2 and ISO/IEC 11770-4. In the latest ISO/IEC 11770-4 (2017) standard, the SPEKE specification is revised from the previous one in ISO/IEC 11770-4 (2006) to address the two attacks reported by Hao and Shahandashti in 2014.

It derives its name from the Greek mythological figure Stentor. Formed in 1992 to succeed Telecom Canada (which was previously known as the Trans-Canada Telephone System, and before that as the Telephone Association of Canada), the alliance comprised the following companies at the time of inception: * Alberta Government Telephones, now Telus * BC Tel, now part of Telus * Bell Canada * Island Telephone Company, now part of Bell Aliant * Manitoba Telephone System, now Manitoba Telecom Services Bell MTS * Maritime Telephone and Telegraph Company, now part of Bell Aliant * NBTel, now part of Bell Aliant * Newfoundland Telephone, now part of Bell Aliant * Northwestel (associate member) * Qu√©bec T√©l√©phone, now part of Telus (associate member) * SaskTel (Saskatchewan Telecommunications) The Trans-Canada and Telecom Canada alliances were ostensibly formed to provide for the standardization of local and long-distance telephone services across Canada as well as provide for consistency in lobbying efforts with provincial and federal governments. By the time Stentor replaced Telecom Canada, internet service was part of the alliance's objectives. In practice, Stentor was also an advertising unit, coordinating national advertising and sponsorships (such as sponsorship of the Olympic Games). The nine full member companies also participated in revenue pooling, and could quickly introduce new services to all nine members. Other telephone companies had to negotiate with Stentor or its predecessors to offer such services as 800 and 900 service. The alliance controlled the following organizations: * Stentor Resource Centre Inc. (SRCI) * Stentor Telecom Policy Inc. (STPI) * Stentor Canadian Network Management (SCNM) * Signature Service Centre (SSC) On January 1, 1999, SRCI and SSC were disbanded and their roles reassumed by their parent organizations, with SCNM remaining in place in a modified form. The status of STPI is unknown but its role has also diminished as the companies take divergent paths. At time of dissolution, about 1,800 people were employed by Stentor. Many of the Stentor companies have since become competitors, with several joining with Stentor's former competitors (Sprint, Rogers). Bell - the parent of Aliant, NorthwesTel, T√©l√©bec and Northern Telephone - almost immediately entered competition with Telus; Bell's ties with SaskTel have also weakened since then.

They are generally fairly small moths, and as such, they have been traditionally associated with the paraphyletic Microlepidoptera. This superfamily used to contain the Hyblaeidae, Thyrididae, Alucitidae (plus Tineodidae), Pterophoridae, and Pyralidae. The first four families are now each split off as a distinct superfamily. Nowadays, Pyralidae are usually split into the Pyralidae sensu stricto and the Crambidae, as both groups have been shown to be monophyletic and a sister group. Some genera (e.g. Micronix and Tanaobela) still defy easy classification and have been variously assigned to the Crambidae or the Pyralidae. Among all Lepidoptera, pyraloids show the most diverse life history adaptations. The larvae of most species feed on living plants either internally or externally as leaf rollers, leaf webbers leaf miners, borers, root feeders, and seed feeders. Some species live parasitically in ant nests (Wurthiini), prey on scale insects (certain Phycitinae), or live in the nests of bees (Galleriinae). The larvae of the Acentropinae are adapted to life under water, and certain Phycitinae and Pyralinae are adapted to very dry environments and their larvae feed on stored food products. Others feed on animal detritus such as carrion and feces. With such a variety of living habits, pyraloids are used in biodiversity studies. Some species are of economic importance, e.g.: * rice stem borers (Chilo spp.; Scirpophaga spp.) * sod grass webworms (different species of Crambinae) * Indian meal moth (Plodia interpunctella) * European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis) * Indo-Australian coconut spike moth (Tirathaba rufivena) * Cacao moth (Ephestia elutella) * Mediterranean flour moth (Ephestia kuehniella) * wax moths (Achroia grisella, Galleria mellonella) * rice moth (Corcyra cephalonica) * beet webworm (Spoladea recurvalis) * European pepper moth (Duponchelia fovealis) * legume pod borer (Maruca vitrata) * eggplant fruit borers (Leucinodes spp.).

These moths are found only in the New World, with most taxa occurring in the Neotropics. Adult moths are externally similar to those belonging to some of the other Macroheterocera families Bombycoidea and Drepanoidea, and thus have been variously treated as belonging to either one of these or other superfamilies.  Distribution  Mimallonids are restricted to the New World, and are distributed in North America, Central America, South America, and the Caribbean (specifically Cuba and The Bahamas). The vast majority of genera and species are found in the tropical regions of the New World, with only five described species from the United States.  Biology  Not much has been published on the natural history of adult Mimallonidae, though most species are thought to be nocturnal. At least three species have diurnal males. Young caterpillars live inside of folded leaves or beneath silken networks, and build portable or semi-portable cases out of silk, frass, and plant material as they grow. The cases are open on either end and vary from irregular in structure to spindle-shaped. The openings of the cases can be blocked by the head and/or the flattened anal plate of the last segment of the body. The sack-like case-making behavior of the caterpillars have earned them the common name \\"sack-bearers\\". Mimallonidae larvae feed on several families of plants, including (but not limited to): Anacardiaceae, Clusiaceae, Combretaceae, Fagaceae, Melastomataceae, Myrtaceae and Rubiaceae. Research at the Area de Conservaci√≥n, Guanacaste, Costa Rica has resulted in the rearing of many species of Mimallonidae, including some from several additional families of plants.  Systematics and evolution  The current consensus, especially in works based on phylogenetic results, consider Mimallonidae to be the sole family of Mimallonoidea. Other phylogenetic studies of all major Lepidoptera lineages support the placement of Mimallonidae as sister to all Macroheterocera, but within the broader clade Obtectomera. This phylogenetic placement means that mimallonid moths are not more closely related to any one family of Lepidoptera, but are equally related (share a common ancestor with) all members of the extremely diverse clade Macroheterocera. Morphological features, particularly of the larvae, support the uniqueness of this family and distinctness from Macroheterocera. The systematic relationships with Mimallonidae have been subject to two revisions, resulting in two different classification schemes. William Schaus revised the family and named most of the genera, he then separated the genera into two subfamilies: Lacosominae and Mimalloninae. These subfamilies were based on the presence (Lacosominae) or the absence (Mimalloninae) of the frenulum. It was later realized that this character varies within genera, and thus was deemed a sympleisiomorphy. Using molecular phylogenetics, specifically with the technique of anchored hybrid enrichment, the family was reorganized based on the recognition and naming of robustly supported clades, which were further strengthened with morphological apomorphies. The clades which were robustly supported across all analyses were assigned subfamily status, resulting in recognition of seven subfamilies in Mimallonidae. Using both molecular and morphological phylogenetics, all 42 genera (including some newly described ones) were assigned to the named clades. The 300+ species of the family, too, have been formally classified according to their phylogenetic arrangement. Recently, many of the species formally placed in the genus Cicinnus have been transferred to Gonogramma, making Gonogramma one of the most diverse mimallonid genera. = Subfamilies, tribes, and genera = Below are the named clades of Mimallonidae, with their constituent genera assigned to their subfamily and tribe (wherever applicable). * Zaphantinae ** Zaphanta Dyar, 1910 * Roelofinae **Roelofa Schaus, 1928 *Meneviinae **Cunicumara St Laurent, 2016 **Menevia Schaus, 1928 **Tolypida Schaus, 1928 *Aurorianinae **Auroriana St Laurent and C.

In Surinam, Mimallo amilia has been noted as a pest of guava (Psidium gaujava). In Brazil, M. amilia is a known pest of eucalyptus (Eucalyptus urophylla) and Psychocampa callipius a pest of cashew (Anacardium occidentale). In addition to some Mimallonidae species being regarded as pests, others have been considered as potential biological controls of invasive plants. Species belonging to the genus Druentica have been considered as potential control agents of Miconia calvescens (where it is invasive throughout the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii and Australia) and Clidemia hirta in Hawaii. Aceclostria mus has been evaluated as a potential control agent of the Brazilian pepper tree (Schinus terebinthifolius) in the United States.

Lapse At common law, lapse occurs when the beneficiary or the devisee under the will predeceases the testator, invalidating the gift. The gift would instead revert to the residuary estate or be granted under the law of intestate succession. If the deceased beneficiary was intended to inherit part or all of the residuary estate, then that portion of the estate would pass by intestate succession, as though the testator had left no will. This rule is referred to as the doctrine of no residue of a residue, because the portion of the residuary estate that did not itself pass under the will could not be considered part of the residuary estate at all. Under section 2-604(b) of the uniform probate code, \\"if the residue is devised to two or more persons, the share of a residuary devisee that fails for any reason passes to the other residuary devisee, or to other residuary devisees in proportion to the interest of each in the remaining part of the residue.\\" Simply put, if there are two parties in the remainder and one has not survived, the entirety of the remainder goes to the surviving residuary devisee or devisees. In jurisdictions which have adopted the Uniform Simultaneous Death Act, or the 1991 version of the Uniform Probate Code (but not the previous Uniform Probate Code), any devisee who dies within 120 hours after the testator is legally considered to have died before the testator. In such jurisdictions, only a devisee who survives more than 120 hours after the testator is considered to have met this \\"statutory survival test.\\" Anti-lapse statutes Most common-law jurisdictions have enacted an anti-lapse statute to address this situation. The anti-lapse statute \\"saves\\" the bequest if it has been made to parties specified in the statute, usually members of the testator's immediate family, if they had issue that survived the testator. For example, the New York anti-lapse statute specifies brothers, sisters, and issue, specifically. If the anti-lapse statute does indeed apply, then the issue of the deceased beneficiary will inherit whatever was willed to the beneficiary. The testator can prevent the operation of an anti-lapse statute by providing that the gift will only go to the named beneficiary if that beneficiary survives the testator, or by simply stating in the will that the anti-lapse statute does not apply. Another modification to the common law of lapse is the elimination of the \\"no residue of a residue\\" rule where multiple beneficiaries are named to inherit the residue. The modern view is that where a beneficiary was intended to inherit part of the residuary estate who predeceases the testator, and that beneficiary is not covered by the anti- lapse statute, then that beneficiary's inheritance will return to the residuary estate, to be inherited by the other beneficiaries to whom the residue has been willed.

Personal life Robinson was born at the Hollywood Hospital in Hollywood, California.Ann Robinson Film Reference bio She attended Hollywood High School. Her father was employed by the Bank of Hollywood, at the corner of Hollywood and Vine. He taught her how to ride horses, beginning when she was only three. Robinson hence became an accomplished rider, which led to her first professional work in Hollywood as a stunt rider in film Frenchie with Shelley Winters. In 1957, Robinson eloped to Mexico to marry world class bull fighter (matador), Jaime Bravo, with whom she had two sons; Jaime A. Bravo Jr (TV director for ABC Sports and ESPN), and Estefan A. Bravo (actor, seen in White Trash Wins Lotto, a musical by Andy Prieboy).While residing in Mexico, Robinson played minor Hollywood roles, mainly in science fiction films. The couple divorced in 1967. On February 2, 1970, Bravo was killed in an automobile accident on the way to a bullfight. In 1987, Robinson married real estate broker and business manager Joseph Valdez in California, where they took up residence in the Echo Park area of Los Angeles.{{cite webtitle=Echo Park residents scope out proposed Barlow Hospital developmenturl=http://theeastsiderlacitizen.blogspot.com/2009/echo-park- residents-scope-out-proposed.htmldate=September 8, 2009accessdate=2011-06-24 } Acting career As a stunt horse rider, Robinson doubled for Shelley Winters in Frenchie (1950), starring and riding in several westerns during her career such as The Cimarron Kid (1951) with Audie Murphy, Gun Brothers (1956), and Gun Duel in Durango (1957). Paramount Pictures signed Robinson as an actress in the early 1950s. Her first leading role was as \\"Sylvia Van Buren\\" in The War of the Worlds (1953) co-starring with Gene Barry, a role she quasi- reprised in two later films, first as Dr. Van Buren in Midnight Movie Massacre (1988) and then as Dr. Sylvia Van Buren in The Naked Monster (2005). She also reprised the role in three episodes of the television series War of the Worlds (1988). Robinson worked on several other films, including Imitation of Life (1959), and the Doris Day thriller Julie (1956). She also had a starring role opposite Jack Webb and Ben Alexander in Dragnet (1954), a feature film version of the hit television series. From 1955 to 1959, Robinson was cast in ten episodes of the NBC children's western television series Fury as Helen Watkins, the teacher of series character Joey Clark Newton (Bobby Diamond) and romantic interest of his adopted father, Jim Newton (Peter Graves). Robinson's other television roles were on Adam-12, Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Bachelor Father, Ben Casey, Biff Baker, U.S.A., The Bob Cummings Show, The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show, Days of Our Lives, Four Star Playhouse, General Hospital, Gilligan's Island, It's a Great Life, The Millionaire, My Little Margie, Perry Mason, Peter Gunn, Police Woman, Rawhide, Rocky Jones Space Ranger, Rory Calhoun's The Texan, Waterfront, and The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp. In 1955, she appeared as Joan Carter on the TV western Cheyenne in the episode titled Mountain Fortress. Robinson was featured in several commercials for Home Savings of America, Toni home perms, and Chesterfield Cigarettes. She performed a number of film voice-overs also, in English and Spanish. She did the leading actress' voice in To Begin Again, which won the 1984 Oscar for best foreign film. She also did loops for the Bruce Lee series The Dead Are Alive, Tough Guys, and Survive. In 1985, Robinson appeared in a documentary about George Pal titled The Fantasy Film Worlds of George Pal (produced and directed by Arnold Leibovit). In 1988, Ann Robinson reprised her role as Sylvia van Buren from the original The War of the Worlds film for the War of the Worlds television series. In the 2005 Steven Spielberg film, War of the Worlds, she played a cameo role as Tom Cruise's character's mother-in-law, the grandmother of Dakota Fanning's character, alongside her long-ago co-star Gene Barry. Upon completing this role, she retired from acting altogether. References External links Ann Robinson interview, thespectrum.com; accessed August 10, 2016.

He is most known for laying out four ontological goals for intellectuals: to build up the manifestations of Heaven and Earth's spirit, to build up good life for the populace, to develop past sages' endangered scholarship, and to open up eternal peace. Life and work Zhang Zai was born in 1020 CE in Hengqu, province of Shaanxi. In his childhood he showed interest in military affairs, but began to study the Confucian texts. Like many Song philosophers, Zhang was initially frustrated with Confucian thought and studied Buddhism along with Daoism for a number of years. But, he decided that \\"The Way\\" could not be found in Buddhism or Daoism and resorted back to Confucian texts. His exploration of diverse religious thought had a major impact on his own ideals. In 1056 CE Zhang lectured on the Classic of Changes, which would be known as one of his most memorable works. It is suspected that around this time Zhang had first met the Cheng brothers. After passing the highest level of the civil service examinations, he held several minor government posts. In 1069 CE Zhang was suggested to the Emperor and given a place in the capital's government, but not long after he ran into disagreement with the prime minister and retired to his home Hengqu, where he spent his time studying and teaching. This was likely the most productive period of his life for developing and spreading his own philosophical views. In 1076 CE he finished his most significant work, Correcting Ignorance, and presented it to his disciples. Later in 1076 CE he was summoned back to the capital and restored to a high ranked position. However, in the winter he became sick and was forced to resign again. He never reached his home town of Hengqu, dying on the road in 1077. Zhang was enshrined in the Confucian temple in 1241 for his work. Many of Zhang's writings have been lost. Zhu Xi collected selections of Zhang's writings in his anthology of Song Study of the Way known as Reflections on Things at Hand :zh:ËøëÊÄùÈåÑ. His most important surviving works are probably his commentary on the Changes and Correcting Ignorance. After Zhang Zai's death most of his pupils became involved with the Cheng brothers' (Cheng Yi and Cheng Hao) school. His thought became known for the most part through the efforts of the Cheng brothers and Zhu Xi. Zhu Xi honoured Zhang as one of the founders of the Study of the Way. Zhang Zai's philosophy =The meaning and characteristics of Qi according to Zhang Zai= Zhang Zai's metaphysics is largely based on the Classic of Changes. According to Zhang, all things of the world are composed of a primordial substance called qi. For Zhang, qi includes matter and the forces that govern interactions between matter, yin and yang. In its dispersed, rarefied state, qi is invisible and insubstantial, but when it condenses it becomes a solid or liquid and takes on new properties. All material things are composed of condensed qi: rocks, trees, even people. There is nothing that is not qi. Thus, in a real sense, everything has the same essence, an idea which has important ethical implications. The most significant contribution of Zhang Zai to Chinese philosophy is his concern of qi as the basis of his ontocosmology. The qi or vital force is, according to Zhang Zai, the fundamental substance by which all processes of the universe can be explained. First of all, according to Zhang Zai, the qi or vital force is something forever in the process of changing. Second, the perpetual change of the vital force follows a definite pattern of activity according to the two principles, the yin and yang. The changes undergone by qi result from the perpetual activity of the yin and yang principles. Zhang Zai's conclusion is that there is nothing in the universe that cannot be explained in terms of the interaction of the twofold activity of qi. Third, the change of anything from condensation to dispersion, or from visibility to invisibility does not imply the idea of quantitative extinction of the thing in question. Fourth, Zhang Zai stresses the fact that although the creation and transformation of manifold things can be reduced to one uniform pattern (the interaction of the yin and yang) nothing in the entire universe is the repetition of something else. As an example presented by Zhang Zai, there are no two persons whose minds are exactly alike. Fifth, the perpetual motion of the physical world is not originally caused by any outside force. He states that the cosmos depends on nothing to be its first mover, for the qi as such is a vital and self-moving force that alone makes all change and motion possible (Huang (1968)). =Zhang Zai's belief in human goodness= Neo-Confucians primarily valued Zhang Zai's doctrine of the sage \\"forming one body with the universe.\\" This doctrine represents both the Confucian contiguity with its classical Confucian heritage and an enlargement of the Neo-Confucian system. At the center of Zhang Zai's teaching is the idea of ren, humaneness or human-heartedness, in many ways the salient teaching of the classical Confucian tradition. This basic quality, which was for Confucius and Mencius the bond between human society and the ways of Heaven (tian) and hence fundamental to the underlying moral structure of the universe, was expanded by Zhang Zai to encompass the universe itself, since for the sage to form \\"one body with the universe\\" suggests the complementarity and fundamental identify of microcosm and macrocosm. The doctrine illustrates as well Zhang Zai's belief in the fundamental goodness and purpose of the universe and in the potential of the individual to realize the ideal of the sage. In the teaching of \\"forming one body with the universe,\\" Zhang Zai also claimed to distinguish Confucianism clearly from Buddhism and Daoism. For him the universe and its processes have a real existence. In turn, human life is looked upon as intrinsically valuable and ultimately the very foundation for the realization of sagehood. For Zhang Zai, such a view is clearly distinguishable from Daoism and Buddhism, both of which require a radical departure from the universe as it is given in order to fulfill the soteriological quest. In Zhang Zai's terms, Daoism and Buddhism both emphasize escape from the world, while Confucianism finds fulfillment and ultimate identity precisely within the changes found in this world, a world of qi rather than of emptiness. The sage accepts the ultimate reality of qi and its inherent goodness, he acknowledges the infusion of ren throughout the very structure of the universe itself, and thus he can fulfill the ideal of the sage, \\"forming one body with the universe.\\" Descendants Zhang Zai's offspring held the title of Wujing Boshi (‰∫îÁªèÂçöÂ£´; ‰∫îÁ∂ìÂçöÂ£´; W«îjƒ´ng B√≥sh√¨).https://archive.org/stream/presentdaypoliti00brun#page/494/mode/2up In 1452 Wujing Boshi was bestowed upon the offspring of Mengzi-Meng Xiwen Â≠üÂ∏åÊñá 56th generationhttp://www.angelibrary.com/oldies/ms/073.htmhttps://www.kanripo.org/text/KR2m0014/048http://ctext.org/wiki.pl?if=gb&chapter;=754845http://inspier.com/detial.php?id=10214&catid;=&catname;=http://15269682.blog.hexun.com.tw/102536659_d.htmlhttp://blog.xuite.net/working.yam76/wretch?p=23 and Yan Hui-Yan Xihui È°îÂ∏åÊÉ† 59th generation, the same was bestowed on the offspring of Zhou Dunyi-Zhou Mian ÈÄ±ÂÜï 12th generation,http://baike.baidu.com/subview/1569345/6981614.htmhttp://wapbaike.baidu.com/subview/16550/12959826.htm?uid=BED7E56700DC4CAD3DE1942088E35C24&bd;_page_type=1&st;=1&step;=3&net;=1&page;=15&http://www.zhangzhiyong.cn/lishirenwu/zhoudunyi.htmhttp://m.zwbk.org/lemma/87488http://www.zwbk.org/MyLemmaShow.aspx?zh=zh- tw&lid;=87488http://blog.renren.com/share/236154667/1150747291 the two Cheng brothers (Cheng Hao and Cheng Yi-Chen Keren Á®ãÂÖã‰ªÅ 17th generation), Zhu Xi-Zhu Ting Êú±Ê¢¥ (Zhu Chan?) 9th generation,https://www.douban.com/group/topic/1660938/http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_63a85a490102vs55.html in 1456-1457, in 1539 the same was awarded to Zeng Can's offspring-Zeng Zhicui ÊõæË≥™Á≤π 60th generation, in 1622 the offspring of Zhang Zai received the title and in 1630 the offspring of Shao Yong.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248653434_The_Ritual_Formation_of_Confucian_Orthodoxy_and_the_Descendants_of_the_Sage p. 571.Wilson, Thomas A.. 1996. ‚ÄúThe Ritual Formation of Confucian Orthodoxy and the Descendants of the Sage‚Äù.

The federal government may issue a certificate naming a permanent resident or any other non-citizen suspected of violating human rights, of having membership within organized crime, or is perceived to be a threat to national security.Immigration and Refugee, s. 77 Subjects of a certificate are inadmissible to Canada and are subject to a removal order.Immigration and Refugee, s. 81 Where the government has reasonable grounds to believe that the individual named in the certificate is a danger to national security, to the safety of any person or is unlikely to participate in any court proceedings, the individual can be detained.Immigration and Refugee s. 82 The entire process is subject to a limited form of review by the Federal Court. According to the Ministry of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, the overarching agency dealing with the law, the security certificate provision has existed in \\"one form or another for over 20 years.\\"Ministry of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness - Keeping Canadians Safe, Its use has been documented at least as far back as 1979,Security Certificates, Jason Gratl, BC Civil Liberties Association,Jan. 2005 the year after they were implemented.Toronto Star, Did spy's affair taint case against terror suspect?, March 7, 2009 It is housed within the parameters of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (formerly the Immigration and Refugee Act, which replaced the Immigration Act in 1976). It was amended and took on its present structure in 1991, with an additional amendment in 2002. The security certificate process (sections 33 and 77 to 85 of IRPA) was found to be in violation of sections 7, 9 and 10 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of Canada in the landmark Charkaoui case on 23 February 2007. The Supreme Court suspended the effect of its ruling for one year. On 22 October 2007, the Conservative government introduced a bill to amend the security certificate process by introducing a \\"special advocate\\", lawyers who would be able to view the evidence against the accused. However, these lawyers would be selected by the Justice minister, would only have access to a \\"summary\\" of the evidence, and would not be allowed to share this information with the accused, for example in order to ask for clarifications or corrections.Ottawa tackles terror laws, Toronto Star, 23 October 2007, https://www.thestar.com/article/269427 The amendments are modelled on a much-criticized process already in use in the United Kingdom. The bill amending Canada's security certificate regime, with support from the Conservatives and the opposition Liberal Party, was passed by Parliament and received Royal Assent in February 2008, just days before the court-imposed deadline. Issuing and reviewing a certificate Certificates are governed by the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The certificate is prepared by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) and signed by the Solicitor General of Canada (ministerial post superseded by the Minister of Public Safety) or the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration when a non- citizen, either a permanent resident, refugee or foreign national located in Canada, is deemed to be inadmissible on the grounds that the subject is suspected to be a threat to national security, or has violated human rights abroad, or is involved with organized crime. The signed certificate is then referred to a Federal Court judge who reviews the evidence prepared by CSIS. Hearsay is admissible as evidence. All or part of the evidence may be heard in secret, in the absence of the subject of the certificate, if the judge deems that airing it publicly may hurt national security or put the safety of any individual at risk. There is no provision for such evidence or precise allegations to be revealed to the subject being detained or to his or her lawyer, though the judge may provide a summary of the evidence provided. Key terms, such as \\"national security\\", are not defined in the Act. If the judge determines that the certificate is not \\"reasonable\\" (the order of proof used in security certificate cases), the certificate is quashed. If the judge decides that it is \\"reasonable\\", then the certificate becomes a removal order. The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act states that the Federal Court's decision can be appealed \\"only if the judge certifies that a serious question of general importance is involved and states the question\\". Detention and deportation In the case of refugees and refugee applicants, the named person is automatically detained, without the opportunity to apply for release on bail until 120 days after the certificate is upheld by a Federal Court judge. In the case of Permanent Residents, where the government has reasonable grounds to believe that the individual named in the certificate is a danger to national security, to the safety of any person or is unlikely to participate in any court proceedings, the individual can be detained, with the opportunity to apply for release on bail every six months from the beginning of their detention. An individual may be held for several years, without any criminal charges being laid, before the review is completed. In practice, the fact that there is often a risk of torture on the one hand, and a limited legal opportunity to challenge detention, on the other, has meant that named individuals are neither released from prison nor deported after the certificate is upheld. Amnesty International wrote of several security certificate detainees on 2 February 2007, ‚ÄúTheir detention has truly become tantamount to being indefinite as they have limited choices: either remain detained while continuing to pursue legal challenges to the unjust procedure that governs their cases, or agree to be returned to countries where Amnesty International believes they face a serious risk of torture.‚Äù A recent trend has been towards releasing detainees under strict conditions or transferring them to house arrest. People named under certificates are exempted from legal provisions designed to prevent deportations to risk of torture or other human rights abuse. The government's position, following its interpretation of the Supreme Court Suresh ruling, is that a named individual can be deported even if it is found that they risk torture or death. Outstanding security certificates Adil Charkaoui's security certificate was quashed in October 2009 by the Federal Court. Hassan Almrei's security certificate was quashed in December 2009. Three others remain imprisoned under house arrest. The conditions of the three people subject to outstanding certificates are as follows: *Mohammad Zeki Mahjoub, an Egyptian detained in Toronto since June 2000, ordered released under house arrest by a Federal Court judge on February 15, 2007.CTV, Feb 15, 2007 - man held since 2000 ordered released, order issued in Mahjoub v.

He continues to fight for his freedom through legal action. *Mahmoud Jaballah, an Egyptian detained in Toronto since August 2001, also ordered to be released under house arrest by a Federal Court judge on March 6, 2007.Macleans, Mar 7, 2007 - to be released Jaballah remains under strict house arrest while he continues to fight his legal case. *Mohamed Harkat, an Algerian held in Toronto since December 2002 and released on bail in June 2006. He was placed under 24-hour supervision by his wife and must wear an electronic monitoring device. He was ordered deported in July 2006 but remained in Canada as court battles continued until the Supreme Court struck down the legislation in February 2007. A new security certificate was issued in February 2008 under new legislation. This certificate was upheld by Federal Court Justice Simon Noel on 9 December 2010, almost eight years to the day of his original arrest. Harkat is currently fighting the deportation order. Past security certificates In addition to the three people who currently have cases pending, twenty others have been charged under Security Certificate legislation since 1991.Montreal Gazette, July 16, 2003 *Hassan Almrei, a Syrian refugee who was detained in a Toronto jail in October 2001. He was transferred to the \\"Kingston Immigration Holding Centre\\" in April 2006. He has held several prolonged hunger strikes, the longest lasting over 100 days. He was ordered released under house arrest by a Federal Court judge on January 2, 2009. The Federal Court quashed the certificate in December 2009. Mr. Almrei launched a suit of the Canadian government in February 2010. *Adil Charkaoui, a Moroccan-born Montrealer detained from May 2003 until February 2005, when he was freed on strict conditions of release. The 2007 Supreme Court Charkaoui decision become a turning point for Security Certificates. The Supreme Court of Canada concluded that the use of secret evidence under security certificates violated section 7 of the Charter. The government of Canada was given one year to amend the current law which resulted in the introduction of special advocates. Charkaoui's Security Certificate was lifted in September 2009 after the government withdrew evidence rather than disclose it on Court orders. Charkaoui is suing the Canadian government in a bid to hold government officials accountable and to clear his name. *Manickavasagam Suresh, a Sri Lankan, first arrested in 1995 and held til 1998. He was ordered deported, but ongoing court processes kept him in Canada under conditions.Lankannewspapers.com, January 21, 2006 The certificate against him was annulled when the Supreme Court struck down the security certificate legislation in February 2007, and the government did not issue a new certificate against him when new legislation went into effect in February 2008. *Ernst Z√ºndel, a German permanent resident of Canada since 1958 was arrested in May 2003 and deported to Germany in March 2005. *Mourad Ikhlef, an Algerian living in Montreal who gained refugee status in 1994, was arrested in December 2001 and deported in February 2003, when he was handed over directly to Algerian intelligence services.

Nov 16, 2006 11:19 a.m. EST. Accessed on November 16, 2006. Alleged Russian spy arrested in Montreal, Reuters, 16 November 2006 Criticisms A 2004 protest by Christian Peacemaker Teams outside the Toronto office of CSIS. The families of the detainees, supported by thousands of individuals across Canada, have campaigned against the security certificate, arguing that they violate the guarantees of equality and fundamental justice enshrined in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom, creating a two-tiered justice system and allowing individuals to be detained indefinitely, on the basis of secret suspicions, under threat of deportation to torture. Criticism related to violations of civil liberties and due process include the fact that allegations are vague and general, key terms are not defined, precise allegations do not exist or are not disclosed, the low order of proof effectively reverses the burden of proof so that the named person has to prove his innocence, the lack of disclosure of information in the file, the fact that information provided to the court can include hearsay and is known to have included information produced under torture, the fact that evidence has been tainted by destruction of evidence by CSIS, and the lack of appeal. Alexandre Trudeau, son of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau has been vocal in his criticisms of the certificates and has appeared in court to testify in favour of Almrei's and Charkaoui's release, offering to act as a surety on their behalf. Other well-known figures who have joined the campaign against security certificates include Warren Allmand, former Solicitor-General of Canada; Flora MacDonald, former Foreign Affairs Minister of Canada; Denys Arcand; Bruce Cockburn, Naomi Klein, and Maude Barlow. The Canadian Bar Association, Amnesty International Canada, Human Rights Watch, and the Canadian Council for Refugees are among the organisations who have taken a position against security certificates. Members of Parliament from all major political parties in Canada have criticised the measure and called for its abolition. Several have offered to become a surety to some of the detainees. The New Democratic Party has called for the abolition of the measure. Three United Nations committees - the UN Committee against Torture , the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention , and the UN Human Rights Committee - have condemned the security certificate process and called on Canada to reform its legislation. They called on Canada to use criminal law instead of immigration law to deal with its security concerns. In the wake of the Charkaoui decision, a new campaign is developing to call on the government to refrain from introducing new legislation. A pan-Canadian \\"day of action\\" against the introduction of new security certificate legislation was organized on 20 October 2007. It is supported by over sixty organizations and networks, including national unions, migrant justice groups, student organizations, feminist groups, human rights organizations, development associations, community groups, political parties and faith-based organizations. Constitutionality In 2002, the Supreme Court of Canada upheld the security certificate process as constitutional in Suresh v. Canada. The Court ruled that the operative provisions of the security certificate process do not violate Section 7 of the Charter, but that the Immigration Act generally does not allow for the deportation of a person to a country where they will likely be tortured. The Court did rule that deportation to countries suspected of torture may be justified in \\"exceptional circumstances\\".Suresh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2002] 1 S.C.R. 3 at para. 78 The court declined to define those circumstances, instead stating that \\"The ambit of an exceptional discretion to deport to torture, if any, must await future cases.\\" On June 13‚Äì14, 2006, the Supreme Court heard three different appeals from Adil Charkaoui, Hassan Almrei and Mohamed Harkat regarding the constitutionality of the security certificate process. Most of the appellants have argued that the refusal to disclose the evidentiary basis of the certificate violates Section 7 of the Charter. Counsel for Charkaoui also argued that the security certificate process violates judicial independence, the rule of law, and sections 9, 10, 12, and 15 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. On February 23, 2007, the Supreme Court released its decision of Charkaoui v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration). It voted unanimously that the process of certificate review which prohibited the accused from seeing evidence against them violated the Charter. Legislative amendments have been made by the Government of Canada to bring Canada's security certificate regime in compliance with the Court's ruling and were passed in February 2008. The case of Jaballah v. Canada (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) (2006) challenged the constitutionality of detention under the certificate. The Federal Court upheld the detention. It is currently on appeal.

Like his teacher, he was a member of the Old Text School that was challenging the state orthodox New Text School. His contemporary rival was He Xiu (, 129-182). Zheng is notable for his syncretic attempt to bridge the two centuries of rivalry between the two schools. He adopted the strengths of each school in the interpretation of the Confucian classics although he usually favored the Old Text teachings. He was very influential but the government never officially adopted his teachings. The Han Dynasty was already in decline during his lifetime and collapsed a generation after his death. Both schools did not survive the chaos but Zheng's conception of Confucianism would be the mainstream interpretation for centuries. In 200, during the Battle of Guandu, Zheng was ordered by the warlord Yuan Shao to Yuan's stronghold (in modern-day Daming County, Hebei Province), where he died of illness in June.

As a sophomore, he was a first team All- America selection, having run for a school-record 2,542 yards and 18 touchdowns. He capped the season by rushing for 244 yards and three scores in the team's improbable 55‚Äì43 victory over the top-ranked Georgia Southern Eagles in the 1998 NCAA Division I-AA Football Championship Game. As a junior, he was a finalist for the Walter Payton Award, and added another school record‚Äî24 rushing touchdowns‚Äîto his resume to go with 1,846 rushing yards. Shipp finished his college career with 5,383 rushing yards, which currently ranks sixth on the Division I-AA football career record list.  Professional career  = Arizona Cardinals = He signed as an undrafted free agent with the Arizona Cardinals on April 23, 2001. He made the team but played little in 2001, not getting a single rushing attempt. He did return 6 kickoffs. In 2002 Shipp would see many more opportunities. He had his breakout game in a Week 4 win against the New York Giants when he rushed for 92 yards on 17 carries and scored two touchdowns. In Week 11, he rushed for a season high 135 yards and a touchdown against the Oakland Raiders. He finished the year with a team leading 834 rushing yards on 188 carries (4.4 yards per carry) and 9 total touchdowns. At the beginning of the 2003 season Shipp's status was somewhat unclear as the team had signed Emmitt Smith in the offseason. Despite Smith's presence Shipp again led the team in rushing with 830 yards on the season. His yards per carry went down to 3.6 however and he did not score a touchdown. He rushed for a career-high 165 yards against the San Francisco 49ers in a Week 7 win. In training camp in 2004, Shipp broke his leg and dislocated his ankle, forcing him to miss the entire 2004 season. He did not play at all that year. Following the missed 2004 season Shipp still remained with the Cardinals. In 2005, he was again the Cardinals' leading rusher, but this time with only 451 yards on 157 carries, for 2.9 yards per carry. In 2006 Shipp saw much less action, as the Cardinals had signed Edgerrin James. He rushed 17 times for 41 yards. He did have 4 touchdowns, scoring for the first time since 2002, including 3 touchdowns in one game on December 3 against the St. Louis Rams. In 2007, he had limited duty again, with 15 carries for 41 yards, still backing up James. In 2008, Shipp signed a 3-year contract with the Cardinals.

Released in 1997, the game sparked the release of a collection of media centered on the game entitled the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII. The music of the Final Fantasy VII series includes not only the soundtrack to the original game and its associated albums, but also the soundtracks and music albums released for the other titles in the collection. The first album produced was Final Fantasy VII Original Soundtrack, a compilation of all the music in the game. It was released as a soundtrack album on four CDs by DigiCube in 1997. A selection of tracks from the album was released in the single-disc Reunion Tracks by DigiCube the same year. Piano Collections Final Fantasy VII, an album featuring piano arrangements of pieces from the soundtrack, was released in 2003 by DigiCube, and Square Enix began reprinting all three albums in 2004. To date, these are the only released albums based on the original game's soundtrack, and were solely composed by regular series composer Nobuo Uematsu; his role for the majority of subsequent albums has been filled by Masashi Hamauzu and Takeharu Ishimoto. The Compilation of Final Fantasy VII began eight years after the release of Final Fantasy VII with the release of the animated film sequel Advent Children in 2005. The soundtracks for each of the titles in the collection are included in an album, starting with the album release of the soundtrack to Advent Children that year. The following year, Nippon Crown released a soundtrack album to correspond with the video game Dirge of Cerberus, while Square Enix launched a download-only collection of music from the multiplayer mode of the game, which was only released in Japan. After the launch of the game Crisis Core in 2007, Warner Music Japan produced the title's soundtrack. The latest album in the collection, Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII & Last Order: Final Fantasy VII Original Soundtrack, was released by Square Enix the same year as a combined soundtrack album for the game Before Crisis and the animated movie Last Order. The original music received highly positive reviews from critics, who found many of the tunes to be memorable and noted the emotional intensity of several of the tracks. The reception for the other albums has been mixed, with reactions ranging from enthusiastic praise to disappointment. Several pieces from the soundtrack, particularly \\"One-Winged Angel\\" and \\"Aeris' Theme\\", remain popular and have been performed numerous times in orchestral concert series such as Dear Friends: Music from Final Fantasy and Tour de Japon: Music from Final Fantasy. Music from the Original Soundtrack has been included in arranged albums and compilations by Square as well as outside groups. Creation and development Final Fantasy VII was scored by the series' main composer Nobuo Uematsu Nobuo Uematsu composed the music of Final Fantasy VII in less than one year, matching the game's development time, although he had taken two years to create the soundtrack for the previous title, Final Fantasy VI. Final Fantasy VII was the first game in the series to be developed for the PlayStation, and while the media capabilities of the console allowed for pre-recorded Linear PCM (often as Red Book audio tracks on the CD), it was decided to generate the music in real time on the console instead, using samples and note data. This decision has been credited as giving the soundtrack \\"a very distinctive mood and feel\\", forming a strong association for listeners between the game and its soundtrack. Uematsu had initially planned to use vocal performances for the game to take advantage of the console's capabilities, but found that the advanced audio quality required in turn made the game have much longer loading times in each area. Uematsu decided that the quality was not worth the effects on gameplay, though after the release and seeing Suikoden II (1998, PlayStation), which had used higher- quality music instead, he reversed his stance for Final Fantasy VIII. There was a plan to use a \\"famous vocalist\\" for the ending theme to the game as a \\"theme song\\" for the game, but time constraints and thematic concerns, caused the idea to be dropped. Uematsu has stated, however, that the move into the \\"PlayStation era\\", which allowed video game composers to use sounds recorded in the studio rather than from synthesizers, had \\"definitely been the biggest change\\" to video game music. Uematsu's approach to composing the game's music was to treat it like a film soundtrack and compose songs that reflected the mood of the scenes rather than trying to make strong melodies to \\"define the game\\", as he felt that approach would come across too strong when placed alongside the game's new 3D visuals. As an example, he composed the track intended for the scene in the game where Aerith Gainsborough is killed to be \\"sad but beautiful\\", rather than more overtly emotional, creating what he feels is a more understated feeling. Uematsu has additionally said that the soundtrack has a feel of \\"realism\\", which also prevented him from using \\"exorbitant, crazy music\\". The first piece that Uematsu composed for the game was the opening theme; game director Yoshinori Kitase showed him the opening cinematic to the game and asked him to begin the project there. The track was well received in the company, which gave Uematsu \\"a sense that it was going to be a really good project\\". He later stated in the liner notes for the soundtrack album that the music for Final Fantasy VII was his \\"greatest harvest\\" to date. Final Fantasy VII was the first game in the series to include a track with digitized vocals, \\"One-Winged Angel\\". The track has been called Uematsu's \\"most recognizable contribution\\" to the music of the Final Fantasy series, though the composer did not expect it to gain such popularity. The piece, described as \\"a fanfare to impending doom\\", is said to not \\"follow any normal genre rules\\" and has been termed \\"possibly the most innovative idea in the series' musical history\\". Uematsu approached the piece, which accompanies the final battle of the game, in a different manner than previous \\"boss tracks\\": as he felt that using his normal approach would cause unfavorable comparisons to his well-received Final Fantasy VI boss tracks, he instead tried to take a different approach. Inspired by The Rite of Spring by Igor Stravinsky to make a more \\"classical\\" track, and by rock and roll music from the late 1960s and early 1970s to make an orchestral track with a \\"destructive impact\\", he spent two weeks composing short unconnected musical phrases, and then arranged them together into a song, an approach he has never used before or since. The lyrics of \\"One-Winged Angel\\", a Latin choral track that plays at the climax of the game, were taken from the medieval poetry that forms the basis of Carl Orff's Carmina Burana, specifically \\"Estuans Interius\\", \\"O Fortuna\\", \\"Veni, Veni, Venias\\" and \\"Ave Formosissima\\". Uematsu has stated that the intro of \\"One-Winged Angel\\" is based on Jimi Hendrix's \\"Purple Haze\\", that the piece revolves around the image of Sephiroth, and that despite the chorus and orchestra, he still thinks of it as a \\"rock piece\\". He said in a 2005 interview that \\"One-Winged Angel\\" is his favorite tune from the soundtrack, and in 2004 that it was his favorite battle theme from any Final Fantasy game. Final Fantasy VII Albums =Original Soundtrack= Final Fantasy VII Original Soundtrack is a soundtrack album containing musical tracks from the game, composed by Nobuo Uematsu and produced by Uematsu and Minoru Akao. It was originally released on February 10, 1997 through DigiCube and later reissued directly by Square Enix on May 10, 2004. The soundtrack spans 85 tracks over four discs and has a combined duration of 4:39:53. A limited edition was produced along with the original album, containing illustrated liner notes with several pictures of Uematsu's workspace and personal effects, various cutscenes and in-game screen shots from the game, and a discography. The soundtrack covers a wide variety of musical genres, including rock, techno, orchestral, and choral, although the soundtrack as a whole is primarily orchestral. While many of the tracks were intended as background music, reviewers noted the emotional intensity of several tracks, especially \\"Aerith's Theme\\", which plays during a moment described as \\"the most shocking moment in video games,\\" and has been described as the most memorable track from the album. The theme has become popular among fans, and has inspired various arrangements. Other notable tracks include \\"Main Theme of Final Fantasy VII\\". Themes from this track play during several other tunes from the soundtrack, such as \\"Words Drowned by Fireworks\\", to tie the soundtrack together. The regular edition of the album reached No. 3 on the Japan Oricon charts, while the limited edition reached No. 19. Overall, the album sold 148,000 copies as of January 2010, with the limited edition selling a further 21,000. The album was well received by critics. Allmusic awarded Uematsu's original soundtrack a five-star rating.https://www.allmusic.com/album/final-fantasy-vii-mw0001019433 Ben Schweitzer of RPGFan claimed that \\"for the most part, it's a diamond\\", with his primary complaint being the quality of the MIDI sound. He found the tracks to be \\"beautiful\\" and said that \\"One-Winged Angel\\" was \\"possibly the most innovative idea in the series' musical history\\". Patrick Gann of RPGFan concurred and found all of the soundtrack's tunes to be \\"memorable\\" and the Original Soundtrack to be \\"very worth the purchase\\". Philip of Square Enix Music Online, however, disliked the sound quality of the soundtrack and saw several tracks as \\"trivial\\", though he did note that Uematsu \\"has a flair for strong, memorable\\" pieces. In 2006, IGN ranked the album as the best Final Fantasy soundtrack to date and cited the \\"gripping\\" character themes and \\"One- Winged Angel\\" in particular as contributing factors. They also named \\"One- Winged Angel\\" as the best piece of music from the entire Final Fantasy series. The original CDs for both releases were only published in Japan and include only Japanese track names. The official English track names were later added to digital releases of the soundtrack. Track listing =Reunion Tracks= Final Fantasy VII Reunion Tracks is a single-disc album that comprises a selection of tracks from Final Fantasy VII Original Soundtrack. It was initially released through DigiCube on October 22, 1997 and later reissued by Square Enix on February 23, 2005. While the record was never published outside Japan, the music is available in the North American iTunes Store. All of the pieces are the same as on the Original Soundtrack except for \\"Main Theme of Final Fantasy VII\\", \\"One-Winged Angel\\", and \\"Aerith's Theme\\", which were re- recorded with an orchestra and choir. Some versions of the album also contain a hidden pregap track, which can be accessed by rewinding from the start of the album. This track is an instrumental version of \\"One-Winged Angel\\" without the choir. The new arrangements were created by Shir≈ç Hamaguchi. The album spans 1:12:24 over 19 tracks. Final Fantasy VII Reunion Tracks reached No. 20 on the Japan Oricon charts, and sold over 25,600 copies. It received mixed reviews. Gann liked the newly orchestrated tracks, calling them \\"incredibly well-done orchestrations\\", and said that \\"depending on how willing you are to spend money\\" they made the album worth purchasing on their own, although he felt the other tracks offered nothing new to owners of the original soundtrack. Chris of Square Enix Music Online, however, felt that while the orchestrated tracks were well-done, the selection of the other tracks was poor and that the album as a whole was \\"a lousy purchase for most who enjoyed Final Fantasy VIIs score\\". =Piano Collections= Piano Collections Final Fantasy VII is an album featuring piano arrangements of selected Final Fantasy VII pieces composed by Nobuo Uematsu, arranged by Shir≈ç Hamaguchi, and performed by Seiji Honda. The album was released through DigiCube on December 3, 2003 and later reissued by Square Enix on May 10, 2004. It covers a duration of 47:37 over 13 tracks. The album includes light-hearted tracks as well as slower, more emotional pieces, covering a variety of genres such as marches, new-age themes, and jazz. Unlike previous and subsequent Final Fantasy piano albums, Piano Collections Final Fantasy VII was produced many years after the release of the original game. As three of the tracks from this album were reused in the soundtrack to Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, it has been speculated that the album was produced with the intention to provide tunes for Advent Children. Piano Collections Final Fantasy VII reached No. 228 on the Japan Oricon charts, selling 1,200 copies, and was well received by reviewers, with Gann raving that the pieces were fun to listen to, the performer was \\"amazing\\", the choice of tracks was \\"excellent\\", and the album as a whole was a \\"spectacular CD\\". Sophia of Soundtrack Central concurred and stated that the album was \\"quite fulfilling to listen to\\" and that it surpassed her expectations. Compilation albums =Advent Children= Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children is the 2005 CGI film sequel to the original game, and the beginning of the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII. Its soundtrack album, Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Original Soundtrack, was released on September 28, 2005, containing new material created specifically for the movie, as well as arrangements of tunes from the Final Fantasy VII soundtrack. Both the original tracks and the arrangements cover a variety of musical styles, including orchestral, choral, classical piano, and rock music; Variety noted that the styles vary between \\"sparse piano noodlings, pop metal thrashings and cloying power ballads\\". The tracks were composed by Nobuo Uematsu, Keiji Kawamori, Kenichiro Fukui, and Tsuyoshi Sekito, and arranged by Fukui, Sekito, Kawamori, Shir≈ç Hamaguchi, and Kazuhiko Toyama. Upon hearing each track, Nomura would make some changes, and have the composers re-record the piece. The song \\"Calling\\" from 1989 by former Bo√∏wy vocalist Kyosuke Himuro was used in the film's credits. Some of the piano tracks are longer than what was included in the movie. The album spans 26 tracks on two discs, covers a duration of 1:21:41. In addition to the regular release, a limited edition was produced with a foil slipcover and a booklet of credits and lyrics. The soundtrack album reached position #15 on the Japanese Oricon music charts, and stayed on the charts for 10 weeks. A mini-album titled Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Complete Mini Album was released on April 10, 2009 to coincide with the release of the Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Complete version of the movie. The new release of the movie included a new ending theme, \\"Safe and Sound\\", by Kyosuke Himuro and My Chemical Romance singer Gerard Way, and replaced \\"Water\\" with a new song, \\"Anxious Heart\\". The mini-album was five tracks and 29:17 long. The included tracks on the album were new versions of \\"The Chase of Highway\\", \\"Those Who Fight Further\\", \\"Sign\\", \\"Advent: One-Winged Angel\\", and \\"On the Way to a Smile\\", a piece from the Final Fantasy VII-based anime On the Way to a Smile. A larger album, Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Complete: Reunion Tracks, was released with 21 tracks on September 16, 2009. This album contains the tracks from the mini-album, as well as several pieces that were lengthened for the Complete film version but not rearranged. Reunion Tracks appeared on the Oricon charts for a single week at position #108. Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Original Soundtrack sold over 38,900 copies, and was well received by critics. Gann said that Final Fantasy fans have \\"no excuse\\" not to buy the album and noted that his only disappointments were that three of the tracks were the same as on the Piano Collections album, and that as a film score, some of the shifts in the pieces make less sense outside of the context of the visuals. Chris Carle of IGN called it a \\"jagged but beautiful blend of opera, metal and electronica\\", and a \\"richly-layered, complex and utterly listenable soundtrack\\" while praising the variety of musical styles used and the quality of the pieces. In contrast to Gann, he felt that \\"divorced from the film, the score is still amazingly listenable\\". Track listing =Dirge of Cerberus= Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII was released for the PlayStation 2 in January 2006, and its soundtrack, Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII Original Soundtrack, was released a month later. The tracks were composed by Masashi Hamauzu and orchestrations were provided by Yoshihisa Hirano, making it the first Final Fantasy VII-related soundtrack to not include new material from Nobuo Uematsu. Koji Haishima conducted the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra, which performed the music for around half of the album. The soundtrack also contains the songs \\"Longing\\" and \\"Redemption\\" by Japanese musician and actor Gackt, and was released through the artist's ex label, Nippon Crown. The album contains a mix of orchestral and rock tracks, with some orchestral performances of slow compositions and marches and both styles of music used for faster-paced \\"threatening\\" and \\"dynamic\\" tunes. GameSpot describes the music as ranging from \\"quiet, almost nonexistent ambient tunes to dramatic, orchestrated tracks\\". The album was launched on February 15, 2006, and spans 53 tracks over two discs, covering a duration of 2:14:22. The limited edition of the soundtrack includes a case which is designed to hold the soundtrack, along with the game disc and the limited edition of the \\"Redemption\\" single and associated DVD, although these other albums must be purchased separately. Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII Original Soundtrack was given mixed reviews from critics. Gann called it \\"solid, [...], but not awe-inspiring\\" and dismissed the limited edition extras as not worth the purchase. Eduardo of Square Enix Music Online, however, described it as \\"nearly perfect\\" and said that he \\"can, and will, run out of positive adjectives to describe the Dirge of Cerberus Final Fantasy VII Original Soundtrack. It's a work of genius\\". The album reached position #19 on the Oricon charts, and sold over 14,300 copies; the \\"Redemption\\" single sold over 125,000 copies. Track listing Dirge of Cerberus Multiplayer Mode The Japanese version of Dirge of Cerberus included a multiplayer mode absent from other releases, which contained music tracks not used in the single- player game. Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII Multiplayer Mode Original Sound Collections is a download-only soundtrack album for the multiplayer tracks released through the Japanese iTunes Store and the Square Enix Music Download website on August 22, 2006. It spans 1:07:07 over 27 tracks. The soundtrack includes all the music from the multiplayer mode and some music from the single-player game which did not appear on the previous soundtrack album, including two tracks composed by Ryo Yamazaki for the North American release of the game. Eduardo of Square Enix Music Online also appreciated Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII Multiplayer Mode Original Sound Collections, saying that it accented the Original Soundtrack well and that \\"Hamauzu and Yamazaki have delivered strongly and, with a decent mix of electronica, orchestral music, and rock, the entirety of the Dirge of Cerberus musical experience cannot be missed\\". =Crisis Core= Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Original Soundtrack is the soundtrack of the game Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII. It was released on October 10, 2007 by Warner Music Japan and covers 55 tracks over two discs with a total duration of 2:20:59. The music was primarily composed by Takeharu Ishimoto, with a few tracks provided by Kazuhiko Toyama. It was Ishimoto's second major work, after the soundtrack to The World Ends with You; the only titles he had composed for previously were World Fantasista, a little-known soccer game for which he was a co- composer, and the cell phone game Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII. The tracks composed by Ishimoto cover a range of moods, from \\"harsh and in-your-face\\" to \\"stunning and lovely\\", but were primarily used as ambient background music. The soundtrack also includes a large number of arrangements of tunes from the original Final Fantasy VII score, as well as a theme song entitled \\"Why\\", performed by Ayaka. A variety of musical instruments were used for the soundtrack, including piano and synthesizers, but critics noted that Ishimoto used guitars, both electronic and acoustic, more and better than any previous Final Fantasy soundtrack. Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII Original Soundtrack sold over 13,300 copies, while \\"Why\\" sold 60,000 copies. It received mixed reviews by critics, with Don of Square Enix Music Online stating that while some of Ishimoto's and all of Toyama's arrangements were excellent, the original pieces that made up the bulk of the album offered \\"very little that is actually worth a listen\\". Gann was more lenient, praising Ishimoto for writing \\"an excellent soundtrack\\" and being especially happy with the quality of the arrangements of Uematsu's pieces. Gann did, however, note that because Ishimoto's original works were more ambient, his arrangements, and by extension Uematsu's work, far outshone his own new contributions. He also felt that the theme song \\"Why\\" was \\"generic\\" and \\"bland\\". Sophia Tong of IGN described the album as a \\"mixed bag\\", stating that some of the arrangements and new tracks were \\"fantastic\\" while others were \\"not all that compelling\\", and lamented the overuse of a few themes throughout the soundtrack. Track listing =Before Crisis and Last Order= Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII & Last Order: Final Fantasy VII Original Soundtrack is the combined soundtrack album of the original video animation Last Order: Final Fantasy VII and the game Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII. Before Crisis serves as a prequel to Final Fantasy VII while Last Order is a side story to Final Fantasy VII, showing some of the same story elements from Crisis Core and Final Fantasy VII from an alternate viewpoint. The album spans 27 tracks, of which the first 12 are from the game and the remainder are from the animation. The album was released on December 19, 2007 by Square Enix, and was mainly composed by Ishimoto, with some tunes based on works from Final Fantasy VII by Uematsu. Many of the pieces composed for the two works were used either directly or in an arranged form in Crisis Core. As this soundtrack album was released after the soundtrack to Crisis Core, these pieces were generally not included in the Before Crisis album. The album covers a duration of 63:48. Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII & Last Order: Final Fantasy VII Original Soundtrack was poorly received by critics. Gann said that \\"the whole album is a flop compared to the quality composition of Crisis Core\\" and that the contents of the album were \\"the leftovers, B-Sides, and less-impressive tracks from Ishimoto's arsenal of FFVII music\\", especially as many tracks were used in the Crisis Core soundtrack and not repeated in this album. Chris (also known as \\"Dark Cloud\\") of Square Enix Music Online agreed, saying that the album \\"is probably one of the worst I've heard in a very long time\\" and recommended it only for listeners who like \\"loud music without much creativity\\". Legacy The Black Mages, a now defunct band led by Nobuo Uematsu that arranged music from the Final Fantasy series into a rock music style, has arranged four pieces from Final Fantasy VII. These are \\"J-E-N-O-V-A\\" and \\"Those Who Fight Further\\" from The Black Mages, published in 2003, \\"Advent One-Winged Angel\\" from Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Original Soundtrack and \\"Opening ~ Bombing Mission\\" from Darkness and Starlight, published in 2008. Music from Final Fantasy VII has also been used in other games, such as the fighting game Ehrgeiz, and the Kingdom Hearts series. Uematsu continues to perform certain pieces in the Dear Friends -Music from Final Fantasy- concert series. The music of Final Fantasy VII has also appeared in various official concerts and live albums, such as 20020220 Music from Final Fantasy, a live recording of an orchestra performing music from the series including \\"Aerith's Theme\\" and \\"One-Winged Angel\\". Additionally, several pieces from the game were performed by the New Japan Philharmonic Orchestra in the Tour de Japon: Music from Final Fantasy concert series, and in the Video Games Live international concert series. The Advent Children version of \\"One-Winged Angel\\" was performed at the Press Start -Symphony of Games- 2007 concerts in Yokohama and Osaka, Japan, while The Black Mages performed \\"Those Who Fight Further\\" at the Extra: Hyper Game Music Event 2007 concert in Tokyo on July 7, 2007. Independent but officially licensed releases of Final Fantasy VII music have been composed by such groups as Project Majestic Mix, which focuses on arranging video game music. Selections also appear on Japanese remix albums, called d≈çjin music, and on English remixing websites, such as OverClocked ReMix.

Made of beef, it is similar in appearance and texture to salami, though somewhat darker in color. Typically served as a cold cut or appetizer, Lebanon bologna has a distinct tangy flavor, moreso than other generally similar fermented meat products such as summer sausage. Hardwood smoking imparts a strong smokiness to the traditionally prepared versions of the product; increasingly, liquid smoke is used as a substitute for this costly time- and labor-intensive process.  Origin  Lebanon bologna was developed by the Pennsylvania Dutch of Lebanon County, Pennsylvania prior to the 1780s and was a common item by the early 1800s, reflecting the slow-cured and smoked sausage traditions of Western Europe. Still produced primarily in that area, it is found in markets throughout the United States and typically served as a cold cut and as an appetizer. In addition to the original, a sweet version is made.  Manufacture  Typically, curing salts are added to the ground and spiced meat to control microbial growth during processing. The blended and stuffed beef sausage is then aged for 10 days prior to smoking to enrich lactic acid bacteria and allow for the reduction of nitrate to nitrite. Fermentation occurs during a slow cold smoke (kept at a temperature below ) that can last for up to four days. A one pH unit (or more) decline is observed during this step, as well as the development of nitrosohemochrome, the pigment responsible for the red color of cured meats.

Compound modifiers are grammatically equivalent to single-word modifiers, and can be used in combination with other modifiers. (In the preceding sentence, \\"single-word\\" is itself a compound modifier.) The constituents of compound modifiers need not be adjectives; combinations of nouns, determiners, and other parts of speech are also common. For example, man-eating (shark) and one-way (street). The punctuation of compound modifiers in English depends on their grammatical role. Attributive compounds‚Äîmodifiers within the noun phrase‚Äîare typically hyphenated, whereas the same compounds used as predicates will typically not be (if they are temporary compounds), unless they are permanent compounds attested as dictionary headwords. Compound adjectives Words that function as compound adjectives may modify a noun or a noun phrase. Take the English examples heavy metal detector and heavy-metal detector. The former example contains only the bare adjective heavy to describe a device that is properly written as metal detector; the latter example contains the phrase heavy-metal, which is a compound noun that is ordinarily rendered as heavy metal absent an accompanying adjective. In the latter example, however, heavy-metal functions as a compound adjective that modifies the noun detector. Note that whether a word sequence such as \\"heavy + metal + detector\\" implies a compound adjective + noun or bare adjective + compound noun depends on the punctuation. For instance, heavy-metal detector and heavy metal detector can refer to quite different things: heavy-metal detector implies a device that detects heavy metals (wherein heavy-metal functions as a compound adjective that modifies the noun detector). By contrast, heavy metal detector, without the hyphen, refers to a metal detector that is heavy. Heavy is a bare adjective that modifies the compound noun metal detector. Thus, heavy metal detector is a bare adjective + compound noun sequence. A strategy to avoid conflation of compound adjective + noun versus bare adjective + compound noun sequences is to clearly distinguish the usage of an attributive adjective and a noun adjunct. Accordingly, the phrase heavy metallic detector unequivocally employs a compound adjective to describe a weighty detector made of metal. Hyphenation of elements in English Conventionally, and with the support of modern writing guides, compound modifiers that appear before a noun phrase must include a hyphen between each word, subject to certain exceptions. Hyphens are used in this way to prevent confusion; without their use, a reader might interpret the words separately, rather than as a phrase. Hyphens join the relevant words into a single idea, a compound adjective. When a numeral and a noun are used in a compound modifier that precedes a noun, the numeral and the noun take the singular form. =Exceptions= Major style guides advise consulting a dictionary to determine whether a compound adjective should be hyphenated; compounds entered as dictionary headwords are permanent compounds, and for these, the dictionary's hyphenation should be followed even when the compound adjective precedes a noun. According to some guides, hyphens are unnecessary in familiar compounds used as adjectives \\"where no ambiguity could result\\", while other guides suggest using hyphens \\"generally\\" in such compounds used as adjectives before nouns. It may be appropriate to distinguish between compound modifiers whose adverb has the suffix -ly, such as quickly and badly, and those whose adverb does not, such as well.Hyphens ‚Äì Punctuation Rules, GrammarBook.comGuardian and Observer Style Guide (see section on adverbs) The -ly suffix on an adverb allows readers to understand its lexical category (if not in the technical sense, then at least in the sense of the intended meaning), showing that it is intended to modify the adjective that it precedes and so not requiring hyphenation. Quickly and badly are unambiguously adverbs. Other adverbs (such as well can commonly be used as adjectives; these adverbs without the -ly suffix therefore commonly take a hyphen. For example, one could speak of a well-known actress or a little-known actress. If the compound modifier that would otherwise be hyphenated is changed to a post-modifier‚Äîone which is located after the modified noun phrase‚Äîthen the hyphen is conventionally not necessary: the actress is well known. Finally, the word very in a compound modifier is generally not accompanied by a hyphen.Compound Modifiers, DailyWritingTips.com Where both (or all) of the words in a compound modifier are nouns, it is seen as not necessary to hyphenate them, as misunderstanding is unlikely.Compound Modifiers, Writing.com =Examples= *Man-eating shark (as opposed to man eating shark, which could be interpreted as a man eating the meat of a shark) *Wild-goose chase (as opposed to wild goose chase, which could be interpreted as a goose chase that is wild) *Long-term contract (as opposed to long term contract, which could be interpreted as a long contract about a term) *Zero- liability protection (as opposed to zero liability protection, which could be interpreted as there being no liability protection) Other languages =Hungarian= Hungarian orthography describes three types of this modification in spelling, as described in the main article. =Japanese= Japanese equivalents of adjectives can compound. This is quite common for na- adjectives, which function essentially as attributive noun phrases, while it is relatively uncommon for i-adjectives, and is much less common than Japanese compound verbs. Common examples include (noun + i-adjective) and (i-adjective stem + i-adjective).

It is best known for the manufacture of Lego-brand toys, consisting mostly of interlocking plastic bricks. The Lego Group has also built several amusement parks around the world, each known as the LEGOLAND Resorts, and operates numerous retail stores. The company was founded on 10 August 1932 by Ole Kirk Christiansen. The word \\"lego\\" is derived from the Danish words \\"leg godt\\", meaning \\"play well\\". In the first half of 2015, The Lego Group became the world's largest toy company by revenue, with sales amounting to US$2.1 billion, surpassing Mattel, which had US$1.9 billion in sales. On 11 August 2017, Lego announced that Niels B. Christiansen would become the new CEO, effective 1 October of the same year.  History  The history of Lego spans nearly 100 years, beginning with the creation of small wooden playthings during the early 20th century. Manufacturing of plastic Lego bricks began in Denmark in 1947, but since has grown to include factories throughout the world. In 1961, Lego was managed by Samsonite until 1972 in the United States and 1986 in Canada.  Logos  Below are historical images of the Lego logo throughout the company's existence. Lego 1934 logos.jpg1934‚Äì1936 Lego Logo 1936.jpg1936‚Äì1946 Lego Logo 1946.jpg1946‚Äì1948 Lego Logo 1948.gif1948‚Äì1950 Lego Logo 1950.jpg1950‚Äì1953 Lego logos3.jpg1953‚Äì1954 Lego Logo 1954.jpg1954‚Äì1959 Lego 1959.jpg1959‚Äì1964 Lego logos4.jpg1964‚Äì1972 LEGO 1972 logo.png1972‚Äì1998 LEGO logo.svg1998‚Äìpresent  Trademark and patents  Since the expiry of the last standing Lego patent in 1989, a number of companies have produced interlocking bricks that are similar to Lego bricks. The toy company Tyco Toys produced such bricks for a time; other competitors include Mega Bloks and Best-Lock. These competitor products are typically \\"compatible\\" with Lego bricks, and are often marketed at a lower cost than Lego sets. One such competitor is Coko, manufactured by Chinese company Tianjin Coko Toy Co., Ltd. In 2002, Lego Group's Swiss subsidiary Interlego AG sued the company for copyright infringement. A trial court found many Coko bricks to be infringing; Coko was ordered to cease manufacture of the infringing bricks, publish a formal apology in the Beijing Daily, and pay a small fee in damages to Interlego. On appeal, the Beijing High People's Court upheld the trial court's ruling. In 2003, The Lego Group won a lawsuit in Norway against the marketing group Biltema for its sale of Coko products, on the grounds that the company used product confusion for marketing purposes. Also in 2003, a large shipment of Lego-like products marketed under the name \\"Enlighten\\" was seized by Finland customs authorities. The packaging of the Enlighten products was similar to official Lego packaging. Their Chinese manufacturer failed to appear in court, and thus Lego won a default action ordering the destruction of the shipment. Lego Group footed the bill for the disposal of the 54,000 sets, citing a desire to avoid brand confusion and protect consumers from potentially inferior products. In 2004, Best-Lock Construction Toys defeated a patent challenge from Lego in the Oberlandesgericht, Hamburg The Lego Group has attempted to trademark the \\"Lego Indicia\\", the studded appearance of the Lego brick, hoping to stop production of Mega Bloks. On 24 May 2002, the Federal Court of Canada dismissed the case, asserting the design is functional and therefore ineligible for trademark protection. The Lego Group's appeal was dismissed by the Federal Court of Appeal on 14 July 2003. In October 2005, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that \\"Trademark law should not be used to perpetuate monopoly rights enjoyed under now-expired patents\\" and held that Mega Bloks can continue to manufacture their bricks. Because of fierce competition from copycat products, the company has always responded by being proactive in their patenting and has over 600 United States‚Äìgranted design patents to their name.  Financial results  Lego factory in Kladno, Czech Republic, established in 2000. This is one of several sites in the world where Lego toys are manufactured (Denmark, Hungary, China and Mexico are the others). In 2003, The Lego Group faced a budget deficit of 1.4 billion DKK (US$220 million at then current exchange rates; equal to EUR 175 million), causing Poul Plougmann to be replaced by Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen as president. In the following year, almost one thousand employees were laid off, due to budget cuts. However, in October 2004, on reporting an even larger deficit, Kristiansen also stepped down as president, while placing DKK800 million of his private funds into the company. In 2005, The Lego Group reported a 2004 net loss of DKK1,931 million on a total turnover, including Legoland amusement parks, of DKK7,934 million. For 2005, the company returned a profit of DKK702 million, having increased its revenue by 12% to DKK7,050 million in 2005 against DKK6,315 million in 2004. It also cut expenditures and disposed of amusement parks and a factory in Switzerland. In 2011, sales for the company grew 11%, rising from $2.847 billion in 2010 to $3.495 billion in 2011. Profit for 2011 fiscal year increased from $661 million to $776 million. The increased profit was due to the enormous popularity of the new brand Ninjago, which became the company's biggest product introduction ever. In 2012, it was reported that The Lego Group had become the world's most valuable toy company ahead of Mattel with a value at over $14.6 billion. The Lego Group delivered a turnover of DKK14,142m in the first half of 2015 with an increase of 18% compared with the same period in 2014 measured in local currency (i.e. excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate changes). Net profit for the first half of 2015 was DKK3,553m compared with DKK2,715m for the first half of 2014. First half-year sales were driven by double-digit growth across all geographical regions and strong product innovation on themes such as Lego Ninjago, Lego Elves and Lego Creator. The Lego Group announced on 4 September 2017 its intention to cut 1,400 jobs following reduced revenue and profit in the first half of the year, the first reported decrease in 13 years. The revenue losses are due to a more competitive environment, where the company has to compete not only against its traditional competitors Mattel and Hasbro, but also against technology companies such as Sony or Microsoft as more children use mobile devices for entertainment. The job cuts account for 8 percent of the company's total work force. On May 2018, the company made it to Forbes top 100 World's Most Valuable Brands 2018,url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2018/05/23/the-worlds- most-valuable-brands-2018/#392a19fe610c being 97th on the list.  Legoland  Legoland Discovery Centre in Duisburg, Germany The Lego Group has built eight amusement parks around the world, each known as Legoland. Each park features large-scale Lego models of famous landmarks and miniature Lego models of famous cities, along with Lego themed rides. The first Legoland park was built in Lego's home town of Billund in Denmark. This was followed by Legoland Windsor in England, Legoland California in Carlsbad, US and Legoland Deutschland in G√ºnzburg, Germany. In addition, Legoland Sierksdorf was opened in 1973, but soon closed in 1976. In July 2005, the Lego Group announced that it had reached a deal with private investment company the Blackstone Group to sell all four parks for ‚Ç¨375m to the Blackstone subsidiary Merlin Entertainments. Under the terms of the deal, The Lego Group would take a 30% share in Merlin Entertainments and positions on their board. The sale of the theme parks was part of a wider strategy to restructure the company to focus on the core business of toy products. In 2010, Merlin Entertainments opened the first Legoland water park at the Legoland California site. On 15 October 2011, Merlin Entertainments opened their first new Legoland park, Legoland Florida, in Winter Haven, Florida. It is the largest Legoland opened to date at 145 acres, and also only one of the Legoland parks opened in the United States. The other Legoland (opened at a later date) water park was opened near the same location on 26 May 2012 after only 4 months of construction. Merlin Entertainments opened their second new Legoland park in Nusajaya, Malaysia under the name Legoland Malaysia on 22 September 2012. It is the first Legoland in Asia and was quickly followed by another Lego-themed water park in the same area. The first Lego hotel has also opened near the site. People who stay in the hotel will also get tickets to the theme park and water park. Merlin Entertainments has also planned several new Legoland parks: Legoland Dubai, Legoland Nagoya (scheduled to open in 2015), and Legoland Korea (also scheduled to open in 2015). In addition, they have opened four new Legoland Discovery Centres, which take the Legoland concept and scale it down to suit a retail park environment.  Retail stores  A Lego retail store The Lego Group operates 146 retail stores (83 in the United States, 14 in the United Kingdom, 11 in Germany, 10 in Canada, 7 in France, 2 in Spain, 2 in Austria, 2 in Italy, 2 in Serbia, 2 in Denmark, 1 in Belgium, 2 in China, 1 in Sweden, 1 in Poland, 1 in India, 1 in Lithuania and 3 in Mexico.). The Lego Group also franchised its store brand to Majid Al Futtaim Group, which opened 6 stores in 2015 (4 in the United Arab Emirates, and 2 in Kuwait). = Europe = October 2002 saw a significant change in The Lego Group's direct retail policy with the opening of the first so-called Lego Brand Store in Cologne, Germany. The second, in Milton Keynes, UK, followed quickly ‚Äì several dozen more opened worldwide over the next few years, and most of the existing stores have been remodelled on the new Brand Store template. One of the distinctive features of these new stores is the inclusion of a \\"Pick-A-Brick\\" system that allows customers to buy individual bricks in bulk quantities. How a customer buys Lego pieces at a Pick-A-Brick is quite simple: customers fill a large or small cup or bag with their choice of Lego bricks from a large and varied selection and purchase it. The opening of most of these stores, including the 2003 opening of one in the Birmingham Bull Ring shopping centre in England, have been marked by the production of a new, special, limited edition, commemorative Lego DUPLO piece. Lego opened the first brand store in its home country Denmark in Copenhagen on 13 December 2010. There are 2 stores in Austria, 1 store in Belgium, 12 stores in Germany, 13 stores in the United Kingdom, 6 stores in France, 5 stores in Spain, 2 stores are opened in Serbia, 1 store in Sweden, 1 store in Denmark, and 1 store in Lithuania for a total of 41 stores in Europe. In 2016, 2 stores have been opened in Milan (Italy) and another in Verona (Italy) = North America = In 1992, when the Mall of America opened in Bloomington, Minnesota, one of its premier attractions was the Lego Imagination Center (LIC). An imagination centre is a large Lego store with displays of Lego sculptures and a play area with bins of bricks to build with. The store inventory includes a large selection of Lego sets for sale, including sets which are advertised in Lego catalogues as \\"Not Available in Any Store.\\" A second imagination centre opened at the Disney Springs (formerly Downtown Disney) at Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida. Between 1999 and 2005, Lego opened 24 further stores in North America in 23 states. As of 2016, there are 90 Lego stores operating or soon-to-be operating in North America in 32 US states and five Canadian provinces. These stores sell various Lego merchandise, including minifigures, Pick-a-Brick, and custom packaged minifigures. = India = The first Lego store in India was opened in Chennai, Tamil Nadu in March 2014 by Funskool, under licence from the Lego Group.  Lego Interactive  Lego Interactive (formerly Lego Media and later Lego Software) was the video game publishing division of The Lego Group. The company was founded as Lego Media in 1996 and headquartered in London, England. In February 1999, Lego Media announced their move into the girls' software industry, starting with Lego Friends. Eventually, The Lego Group opted out of the video game business and Lego Interactive was shut down. Former Lego Interactive staff opened Giant Interactive Entertainment, which later became part of TT Games. Lego Media also operated a motion picture division, which produced the BBC children's series Little Robots for Cosgrove Hall Films. In 2003, this division was rebranded to Create TV and Film Limited, and became independent from The Lego Group under Lego's majority owner Kirkbi A/S, which allowed Create TV and Film to branch onto other projects. The company later produced Bionicle: Mask of Light, Bionicle 2: Legends of Metru Nui and Bionicle 3: Web of Shadows for Creative Capers Entertainment. In 2005, Kirkbi A/S sold Create TV and Film to its chief executive officer, Vanessa Chapman, and the company was renamed Create Media Ventures Limited. The sale included Little Robots but excluded the Bionicle movies, which were retained by The Lego Group.  Toy production  A Lego injection moulding plant in Neuhof, an area of Baar, Switzerland Lego products are mass-produced, packaged and shipped on a large scale. Lego Produktion AG was a major production facility for Lego. It was founded in Switzerland in 1974. At the time of its announced closing in 2001, 30% of the world production of Lego was produced at the Swiss facility in Baar. The Baar facility eventually closed in 2004. In April 1962, the Lego Group began producing miniature tires; it became the largest tire manufacturing company in 2011, when it produced 381 million tires that year.  Environmental issues  Lego acknowledges the impact of its operations on the environment, in particular in areas such as climate change, resource and energy use and waste. All manufacturing sites are certified according to the environmental standard ISO 14001. The first Borkum Riffgrund 1 wind turbines off the coast of Germany began producing electricity in February 2015, which will help The Lego Group reach its goal of being based 100% on renewable energy by 2020.Lego website , Accessed 3 July 2014 The company claims to recycle 90% of its waste and that it had made its operations nearly one-third more energy efficient over the five-year period ending 31 December 2013.\\"LEGO Group Responsibility Report 2013\\" , pg 12.

He conceptualized the Neo-Confucian cosmology of the day, explaining the relationship between human conduct and universal forces. In this way, he emphasizes that humans can master their qi (\\"vital life energy\\") in order to accord with nature. He was a major influence to Zhu Xi, who was the architect of Neo-Confucianism. Zhou Dunyi was mainly concerned with Taiji (supreme polarity) and Wuji (limitless potential), the yin and yang, and the wu xing (the five phases). He is also venerated and credited in Taoism as the first philosopher to popularize the concept of the taijitu or \\"yin-yang symbol\\". Life Born in 1017 in Yingdao County, Daozhou prefecture, in present-day Yongzhou, southern Hunan, Zhou was originally named Zhou Dunshi. Raised by a scholar-official family, he was changed his name in 1063 to avoid a character in the personal name of the new Emperor Yingzong. His father died when he was fourteen and he was taken in by his uncle Zheng Xiang. He received his first posting in government through his uncle. Although very active in his civil service career, he never did achieve a high position or get the \\"Presented Scholar\\" degree (jinshi). Some of the positions that he held were district record keeper (1040), magistrate in various districts (1046‚Äì1054), prefectural staff supervisor, and professor of the directorate of education and assistant prefect (1061‚Äì1064). He resigned from his last post one year before he died. He died near Mount Lu in Jiangxi province in 1073. After his death, Zhou was commonly called Zhou Lianxi for a name he adopted in his retirement that honored the Lian stream near his home. He was nicknamed the \\"Poor Zen Fellow\\" by Cheng Yi and posthumously honored as the \\"Duke of Yuan\\" (Yuangong) in 1200.

Writings =Taiji Tushuo= The Taijitu of Zhou Dunyi Zhou Dunyi admiring lotuses by Kaih≈ç Y≈´setsu, mid-17th century The Taiji Tushuo (, Explanations of the Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate or Diagram Explaining the Supreme Ultimate) was placed at the head of the neo-Confucian anthology Jinsilu (Reflections on Things at Hand) by Zhu Xi and L√º Zuqian in 1175. He fused Confucian ethics and concepts from the Book of Changes (I Ching) with Daoist naturalism. He developed a metaphysics based on the idea that \\"the many are ultimately one and the one is ultimate.\\" This was the first 11th-century Chinese text to argue for the inseparability of metaphysics or cosmology and ethics, as well as the first major Chinese text to explore the concept of the taijitu or \\"yin- yang symbol\\". It contained his theory of creation, which can be summarized in the following paraphrase of its first section: > \\"In the beginning, there was t'ai chi (taiji) (the great ultimate of being), > which was fundamentally identical with wu chi (wuji) (the ultimate of non- > being). Because of the abundance of energy within t'ai chi, it began to move > and thus produced the yang (the positive cosmic force). When the activity of > the yang reached its limit, it reverted to tranquility. Through tranquility > the yin (the negative cosmic force) was generated. When tranquility reached > its limit, it returned to movement (yang). Thus yin and yang generated each > other. Then, through the union of the yin and the yang the transformation of > both, the five agents (or elements) of metal, wood, water, fire and earth > were brought into being. These five agents are conceived of as material > principles rather than as concrete things. They can therefore be considered > the common basis of all things. The interaction of the yin and yang through > different combinations of the five agents generates all things in a process > of endless transformation.\\"Arrington, 1999, p. 46 Zhou Dunyi postulated that human beings receive all these qualities and forces in their higher excellence and, hence, are the most intelligent of all creatures. He also believed that the five agents corresponded directly to the five moral principles of ren (humanity), yi (righteousness), li (propriety), zhi (wisdom), and xin (faithfulness). =Tong Shu= The Tong Shu (The All- Embracing Book or Penetrating the 'Book of Changes') was a reinterpretation of the Confucian doctrines. It was the basis for ethics in neo-Confucianism. It stated that the sage is a superior man who acts in accordance with the principles of propriety, humanity, righteousness, wisdom, faithfulness, tranquility and sincerity. Sincerity being the basis for moral nature, it can be used to distinguish between good and evil and to perfect oneself. It spoke of principle, nature, and destiny together, which became three cardinal concepts of Confucian thought. He had a Daoist perspective toward nature. There are stories of Zhou Dunyi loving his grass so much that he would not cut it, reinforcing the concept that humans should appreciate life in nature and the importance of non-action. Zhou Dunyi is known to have said that the best quality of life is that of a pure lotus growing out of dirty waters, where the lotus is the natural equivalent of the noble person. He is known for pulling many ideas from Daoism, Buddhism and Confucianism. School Zhou Dunyi had only two students who made any major contribution to Confucianism: his nephews Cheng Yi and Cheng Hao. The Cheng brothers studied under Zhou Dunyi only for a short time when they were younger. The brothers moved on to establish the Cheng-Zhu School, which dominated Chinese philosophy for over 700 years. Zhou Dunyi is considered the founding father of that school although there are no references in the Cheng brothers' writings to his contributions. Zhou Dunyi was a major influence on Zhu Xi, who was considered one of the greatest Confucian thinkers since Confucius himself. Zhu Xi was known to have said that Zhou Dunyi was the first great sage of the Song Dynasty, particularly for his emphasis on the concept of Wuji. Though he never had much influence during his lifetime, he was remembered as warm, humane, and kin with the natural world. Many Confucians believed that he embodied the virtue of \\"authenticity\\". He had great insight into the Way of Heaven. The first major popularization of the taijitu symbol is also credited to Zhou Dunyi; this symbol (in an altered form) is now known worldwide as the commonly accepted symbol for the Chinese concepts of yin and yang.

He was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the second round of the 2005 NFL Draft. He played college football at San Diego State. McCoy has also played for the New Orleans Saints, Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Seattle Seahawks. Early years McCoy attended Tustin High School in Tustin, California. He set the school record for quarterback sacks with 18.5 sacks as a junior. As a senior, he broke his own record with 23 sacks and was named \\"High School Defensive Player of the Year\\" by the Orange County Register. College career McCoy played college football at San Diego State University where he won All-Mountain West Conference honors. He finished his career with eight sacks, 270 tackles (26.5 for losses), four forced fumbles, three fumble recoveries, four pass deflections, and a blocked kick. Professional career =Philadelphia Eagles= McCoy was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the second round of the 2005 NFL Draft as a project linebacker whom Eagles personnel felt they could develop. McCoy was expected to contribute to special teams, but did not contribute in his rookie season. Going into 2006, he was named the weakside linebacker starter by Defensive Coordinator Jim Johnson. Initially he had been praised as having great speed, sideline to sideline pursuit abilities and a high motor, as well as described as a \\"ball hawk\\". He had an injured shoulder later in the year that prevented him from playing as well as he had during the first 6 weeks of the season, and ultimately led to his benching in favor of rookie Omar Gaither.Matt McCoy finished the season with 66 tackles, 2 sacks, 3 forces fumbles, and 5 tackles for loss. At the beginning of the 2007 season, McCoy was listed as a back-up linebacker and a starter on special team kickoffs. In the team's Week 8 game against the Minnesota Vikings, McCoy was flagged for unnecessary roughness after a late hit on punter Chris Kluwe. The following day, he was cut in favor of practice squad linebacker Akeem Jordan. When asked about the penalty's effect on the transaction, head coach Andy Reid said Jordan was more the reason for the move. =New Orleans Saints= After being let go by the Eagles, McCoy was signed by the New Orleans Saints on November 3, 2007. He appeared in four games with the team, recording two solo tackles. McCoy was not tendered a contract by the team as a restricted free agent the following off-season, making him an unrestricted free agent. =Tampa Bay Buccaneers= On March 4, 2008, McCoy signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. After being inactive for the 2009 regular season opener, McCoy recorded one tackle against the Buffalo Bills on September 20. He was released by the Buccaneers on September 26 when wide receiver Mario Urrutia was promoted from the practice squad. He was re- signed on September 29, when Urrutia was waived. McCoy was released again on October 13, to make room for newly signed wide receiver Yamon Figurs. He was re-signed on November 11. =Seattle Seahawks= On March 16, 2010, McCoy signed with the Seattle Seahawks.

Background He was born in Bergen, Norway. He was the son of Knut Johan Johannesen (1900‚Äì1979) and Ingeborg Malene Olsdatter Skaalevik (1902‚Äì1981). Johannesen graduated artium at Bergen Cathedral School in 1949. He studied history, English and Norwegian at University of Oslo and took his master's degree in Literature History in 1960. He wrote his dissertation V√•rmotivet hos Olaf Bull on the poetry of Olaf Bull (1883-1933). From 1960-63, he was a high school lecturer and 1964-69 a freelance author and writer. In 1969 he joined the University of Bergen as assistant teacher at the Nordic Institute. He was a senior lecturer in Scandinavian literature from 1977, associate professor in 1981-86 and in 1996 he was appointed professor in rhetoric. He drowned during 2005 while on vacation in Egypt. Writing career Georg Johannesen's entered the literary scene with a novel, H√∏st i mars ( (1957), a tender love story with a tragic denouement about romance in the face of bourgeois prejudice. The novel was followed by three collections of poetry. The first of these, Dikt 1959 (1959), deals with temporal subjects. The second collection, Ars moriendi (1965), is structured around a rigid formal arrangement inspired by the Seven deadly sins of Christianity. The last, Nye dikt (1966) is more politically-driven. Johannesen stirred controversy in 1967 with his play Kassandra. The play was attacked for its blasphemous content and caused an uproar when it was first performed at the Det Norske Teatret. The play shows Johannesen's genius of creating a socially critical work. Johannesen's love for paradox and delivering political messages in his work continued in Tredje kongebok (1978), Johannes' bok (1978) and Simons bok (1980). These works were laden with paradox and irony, literary devices Johannesen often worked with. These works were allegorical, shedding light on some of contemporary Norway's problems. The Norwegian drive for oil was presented in a satirical manner in the novel Mongstad (1989), which Johannesen published under the pseudonym Kathy Johns. All his writing shows an interest in the power that language has to enshroud true meaning. Johannesen's most important task was to unveil language. His essays show a certain fondness for paradox. Both his plays and his poems bear evidence of inspiration from the work of German dramatist and poet, Bertolt Brecht (1898‚Äì1956).

Clockwise from top right: Cait Sith, Tifa, Barret, Cloud, Aerith, Yuffie, Red XIII, Vincent and Cid Final Fantasy VII, a role-playing video game developed by Square (now Square Enix) and originally released in 1997, features many fictional characters in both major and minor roles. VII has been followed by multiple sequels and prequels, grouped into the multimedia series Compilation of Final Fantasy VII: these include the 2004 mobile game Before Crisis, the 2005 movie sequel Advent Children, the 2006 shooter spinoff Dirge of Cerberus, and the 2007 action game Crisis Core. Other media include spin-off books and the original video animation Last Order. The setting of Final Fantasy VII is a world that has been described as an industrial or post-industrial science fiction setting. It is referred to as \\"the Planet\\" in most of the games, and was retroactively named \\"Gaia\\" in some Square Enix promotional material. VII follows Cloud Strife, a troubled mercenary who joins with an eco-terrorist group to stop Shinra from draining the life of the Planet to use as an energy source. As the story progresses, conflicts escalate and the world's safety becomes their central concern as new forces emerge to challenge the original group. Cloud and his team eventually face off against the game's antagonist, Sephiroth. Other important characters in the series include Aerith Gainsborough, a flower seller who becomes a good friend to Cloud; Zack Fair, Cloud's friend, a former soldier of Shinra and the protagonist of Crisis Core; and Vincent Valentine, a man made immortal by Shinra experimentation and the protagonist of Dirge of Cerberus. The conflict between Cloud and Sephiroth forms the core narrative around which many of the series' stories are built. Other characters include the Turks, a covert group which originally worked for Shinra. The original characters were designed by Tetsuya Nomura, who had done monster designs for Final Fantasy VI and was chosen for the role after his designs impressed producer Hironobu Sakaguchi. Nomura was responsible for many of the characters and their stories. The scenario for the original game was written by Sakaguchi, Yoshinori Kitase and Kazushige Nojima. Nomura, Kitase and Nojima have been involved in other titles in the Compilation. The characters of VII have met with positive reception in contemporary and modern reviews, while their portrayal in the Compilation titles has been mixed: while Crisis Core was generally praised, the focus on secondary characters in Dirge of Cerberus drew mixed opinions from some, while their appearance in Advent Children was generally cited as confusing or poor for newcomers to the series. The entire cast, along with multiple side characters and villains, have remained popular among critics and series fans over the years, with many lists and opinion polls citing them as some of the best characters in the Final Fantasy series. Concept and creation The original concept for Final Fantasy VIIs world was for a fully modern setting, but after the project moved from the 2D Super Nintendo Entertainment System to development for the PlayStation console, the setting altered with it. Elements from the original concept were later used in Final Fantasy VIII and Parasite Eve. The game's producer, Hironobu Sakaguchi, chose character designer Tetsuya Nomura to create the main cast. Nomura had previously worked on monster designs for Final Fantasy VI. Sakaguchi chose Nomura after being amused by the way Nomura did the storyboarding for the cutscenes. Translation Talking of his role as character designer, Nomura stated that when he was brought on, the main scenario had not been completed, but he \\"went along like, 'I guess first off you need a hero and a heroine', and from there drew the designs while thinking up details about the characters. After [he'd] done the hero and heroine, [he] carried on drawing by thinking what kind of characters would be interesting to have. When [he] handed over the designs [he'd] tell people the character details [he'd] thought up, or write them down on a separate sheet of paper.\\" Nomura also created Zack Fair, who was a late addition to the cast meant to add depth to Cloud and Aerith's relationship, and came up with the name for Red XIII, wanting an \\"interesting\\" name that combined a color and a number. Although the game was Nomura's favorite Final Fantasy project, he felt that it was hindered by graphical limitations, and that his designs were, consequently, very plain in comparison to his \\"true\\" style. The game's plot was created by Sakaguchi, although the majority of scenario writing was done by Yoshinori Kitase and Kazushige Nojima, who conceived of the Shinra plot thread, Cloud and Sephiroth's relationship and Cloud's backstory. The Lifestream, the source of life for the planet, was one of the earliest concepts created for VII, but its depiction and purpose changed drastically during development. The concepts behind the Lifestream and Aerith's iconic death scene were sparked in Sakaguchi by the death of his mother, which inspired a wish to create a realistic death for Aerith rather than a \\"Hollywood\\" sacrificial death. The \\"dark\\" theme described by Nomura is continued throughout the Compilation, with characters such as Kadaj, Loz and Yazoo in Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children and the Tsviets in Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII. Producer Yoshinori Kitase stated that voice acting was one of the topics to which the Compilation team paid close attention. As Cloud and Vincent have similar personalities, care was taken to differentiate between them and their dialogue. The compilation was originally conceived as only one title (Advent Children), which focused on Tifa and Cloud, but they eventually expanded it into a collection which included other games focusing on other characters, such as Zack and Vincent. Nomura himself requested Hajime Tabata, the director of Before Crisis, to create a game focusing on the Turks. =Voice actors= Teruaki Sugawara, the voice director behind Kingdom Hearts, recommended Takahiro Sakurai, Cloud's Japanese voice actor, to Nomura for the role. Nomura had originally asked Sakurai to play the protagonist of video game The Bouncer, Sion Barzahd, but found that his voice best suited Cloud after hearing him speak. Sakurai received the script without any accompanying visuals, and first arrived for recording under the impression that he would be voicing a different character other than Cloud. For Advent Children, Nomura wanted to contrast Cloud and Vincent's voices given their similar personalities. As a sequel to the highly popular Final Fantasy VII, Sakurai felt greater pressure performing the role than he did when he voiced Cloud for Kingdom Hearts. The Japanese voice actors remained the same with Sakurai being surprised by this younger take on Cloud, having not voiced in the original PlayStation video game. Sakurai performed alongside Ayumi Ito, who voiced Tifa, for a few scenes. These recordings left him feeling \\"deflated\\", as the \\"exchanges he has with Tifa can be pretty painful\\", Sakurai commenting that Cloud‚Äîwhom he empathized with as his voice actor‚Äîhas a hard time dealing with straight talk. Nomura wanted Cloud and Vincent's voices to contrast with each other due to their similarities in terms of personality. He felt Vincent was older and more mature than Cloud, and as a result, he cast Sh≈çgo Suzuki, who has a very low voice with. In English adaptations, Cloud is voiced by Steve Burton. Burton was first hired to voice Cloud once a man behind Square saw his work in the 2001 movie The Last Castle. Rachael Leigh Cook has stated in an interview for Kingdom Hearts II that she enjoys playing Tifa and described her as \\"very strong physical and emotionally, but also very sensitive,\\" and as \\"very multi-dimensional\\". In voicing the character, Cook listened to Ito's recording as a guide to how the character sounds. Following Advent Children, Cook thanked Nomura for the film he created as she enjoyed it. Mena Suvari explained that Aerith was given a mothering feel with an ephemeral presence. For the English dub, Cody Christian (Cloud) commented on him being Burton's replacement, stating, \\"Steve, you paved the way. You made this character what it is and have contributed in shaping a legacy\\" and thus wanted to not let Burton down with his take on the character. John Eric Bentley did the voice of Barret who made research in order to properly voice him. He was aided by the translators for the Japanese version who gave him the context of the scenes he had to record. For him, one of the biggest challenges in his work was \\"representation\\" and claimed that Barret was more than one- dimensional character. Playable characters  is the protagonist of Final Fantasy VII, Final Fantasy VII:Advent Children, Final Fantasy VII Remake, and a recurring character through the Compilation.

He is also the adoptive father of Marlene, the daughter of his dead friend, Dyne. Initially, he distrusts and dislikes Cloud, believing him to be nothing more than a heartless mercenary- for-hire, but eventually changes his opinion of him for the better. After AVALANCHE disbands, Barret chooses to continue his mission to save the Planet by trying to find a new energy source to replace Mako. He is voiced in English by Beau Billingslea in Advent Children and Dirge of Cerberus, and John Eric Bentley in Final Fantasy VII Remake. His Japanese voice actor is Masahiro Kobayashi.  is a childhood friend of Cloud. She is one of the lead members of AVALANCHE and it is she who initially convinces Cloud to join them in their rebellion against Shinra. She ultimately helps to unlock Cloud's missing memories when they fall into the Lifestream together, and she is originally the only character who knows of Cloud's past. Tifa appears in all the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII titles. She is voiced in English by Rachael Leigh Cook in most media, and Britt Baron in Final Fantasy VII Remake. In Japanese she is voiced by Ayumi Ito in most appearances, Y≈çko Asada in Ehrgeiz (arcade), and Y≈´ko Minaguchi in Ehrgeiz (PlayStation).  is a flower peddler on the streets of Midgar. She is sought after by Shinra's research department because she is the last of the Cetra (also known as the Ancients), and as such, Shinra believes she is the key to finding the fabled Promised Land. She meets Cloud during the first reactor mission and later on he became her bodyguard. Despite her dying at Sephiroth's hands during the events of VII, Aerith's spirit maintains her cognitive powers and she is able to retain her individuality while in the Lifestream. Aerith, or her influence, appears in nearly every title in the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII. Aerith is voiced by Mandy Moore in Kingdom Hearts, Mena Suvari in Advent Children and Kingdom Hearts II, Andrea Bowen in Crisis Core, Dissida 012, Mobius Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts III Re Mind, and Briana White in Final Fantasy VII Remake. Her Japanese voice actress is Maaya Sakamoto.THE PSX GAME  , birth name , is a powerful, intelligent member of an unnamed canine species with the ability to speak. In Final Fantasy VII, he temporarily joins Cloud's team after they rescue him from Hojo at the Shinra building. Red XIII believed that his father, Seto, was a coward who abandoned their home, Cosmo Canyon, during a war with the Gi Tribe. Upon returning to Cosmo Canyon, however, his adoptive grandfather, Bugenhagen, brings Red XIII to the petrified body of Seto and reveals that he had sacrificed his life to save the village and single-handedly fought the entire invading army. Learning the truth, Red XIII becomes inspired and gains the courage to permanently join Cloud's group. Red XIII makes additional appearances throughout the Compilation. In Before Crisis, he defends a female of his species named Deneh and is subsequently captured by the Turks. In the On the Way to a Smile novella \\"Case of Nanaki\\", Red XIII struggles with the knowledge that he will outlive his friends. He also appears briefly in Advent Children and Dirge of Cerberus; in the former, he aids in the fight against the rogue summoned monster Bahamut SIN, and in the latter he is briefly glimpsed resting with Shelke during the ending. In Final Fantasy VII Lateral Biography Turks -The Kids Are Alright-, he saves a young girl from drowning, and briefly encounters Turk member Tseng. Red XIII was the fourth character to be created by Nomura, who wanted a four-legged playable character in the cast despite inevitable graphical difficulties. He was originally conceived as a member of SOLDIER. His standard name, \\"Red XIII\\", was thought up by Nomura during the concept stage because he wanted something that didn't sound like a normal name. The final name came from combining the character's hair color with the number 13, an unlucky number. His real name, Nanaki, was chosen by other staff members. Nomura gave Red XIII tattoos and a general Native American motif. The character's tail having a flame at its tip was made to add more color. The name Nanaki was chosen due to its Native American sound, which linked with Red XIII's theme and backstory. Red XIII's limited appearance in Advent Children was due to difficulties with accurately animating the character's hair in a realistic manner. For his action scenes, four separate CGI layers had to be created and overlapped. In English he is voiced by Liam O'Brien in Advent Children and Max Mittelman in Final Fantasy VII Remake.Max Mittelman Tweet In Japanese he is voiced by Masachika Ichimura in Advent Children, and Kappei Yamaguchi in Remake.  is the daughter of the leader of Wutai, who feels her country has lost its former glory in the aftermath of a war with Shinra and has become a resort town. Yuffie is introduced when she ambushes the protagonist Cloud Strife and his allies in either the Gongaga jungle or the forests south of Junon, appearing as \\"Mystery Ninja\\". If the player defeats her in combat and then chooses the correct series of dialogue choices, she introduces herself and joins the player's party as one of player characters. However, once in Wutai Village, Yuffie steals the party's Materia and hides but is kidnapped by a Midgar crime lord, the lecherous Don Corneo. When the group rescues Yuffie, she returns the stolen Materia and continues working with the party.

Rude is voiced by Crispin Freeman in most appearances and by William Christopher Stephens in Final Fantasy VII RemakeMeet the English voice cast for FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE in English and Taiten Kusunoki in Japanese. *, the newest member of the Turks. Inexperienced and clumsy, but taking her job very seriously, she is an antagonist in VII and minor character in Advent Children. Elena is voiced by Bettina Bush in English and Megumi Toyoguchi in Japanese. *, the leader of the Turks after Veld leaves the Turks in the aftermath of Sephiroth's attack on Nibelheim. Initially portrayed as an antagonist in VII, he acts as an ally in Crisis Core and is a minor character in Advent Children. Tseng is voiced by Ryun Yu in most appearances and by Vic Chao in Final Fantasy VII Remake in English and Junichi Suwabe in Japanese. *, a playable character in Before Crisis and a supporting character in Crisis Core. Bearing the codename . While around Zack, she uses the name \\"Cissnei\\", though it is not her real name. Cissnei is voiced by Carrie Savage in English and Asumi Nakada in Japanese. *, alternately called Verdot, is the former leader of the Turks. Originally a loyal member, he falls out of favor with the company during the struggle against AVALANCHE, which includes bungled operations and the company trying to use the Turks as cannon fodder. Veld eventually resigns his position upon finding out that his daughter, whom he thought dead in a bungled Shinra operation, is still alive under the name \\"Elf√©\\". While he is declared an enemy of Shinra and apparently killed, he is in fact spirited away with his daughter so he can live his life in peace. *, a Turk who acts as one of the main characters of Before Crisis. Generally known under the moniker of \\"Legendary Turk\\", and formally an anti-Shinra activist known as \\"Death God of the Battlefield\\", he is recruited into the Turks by Veld. While he leaves the Turks for a time, he returns after Veld resigns. Antagonists =Sephiroth= is the main antagonist of Final Fantasy VII and Advent Children. Originally a member of Shinra's SOLDIER elite, a traumatic incident involving his true origins drove him insane. This prompts him to abandon his humanity and attempt to attain godhood by absorbing the Lifestream, the source of life on the planet. He manipulates and tortures Cloud over the course of Final Fantasy VII, and kills Aerith at the Forgotten City. Cloud ultimately destroys him at the end of the game, but he returns in Advent Children, where he is reborn and subsequently defeated again by Cloud. Sephiroth also appears in nearly every title in the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII. The character is voiced in English by Lance Bass in the first Kingdom Hearts, George Newbern in most media, and Tyler Hoechlin in Final Fantasy VII Remake. In Japanese he is voiced by Toshiyuki Morikawa in most appearances, and Shin-ichiro Miki in Ehrgeiz. =Jenova= is an extraterrestrial lifeform who crash-landed on the planet two thousand years prior to the events of VII, portrayed in multiple titles in the Compilation as a female humanoid. When Jenova originally crashed, she began infecting the Cetra with a virus, to the point that they were almost wiped out. However, a small group managed to seal Jenova in a tomb, which was later excavated by Shinra. Jenova was mistaken for a Cetra, and samples from her remains were used in the experiments that created SOLDIER and Sephiroth. Sephiroth and Jenova's goal in both Final Fantasy VII and Advent Children is to take control of the planet and use it to roam through space until they find another world to build on. In Advent Children, Jenova's last remains are acquired by Rufus, whilst the Remnants hope to find and use them to resurrect Sephiroth. Jenova is also responsible for the disease Geostigma, which infects all those who came into contact with the tainted Lifestream after Sephiroth was defeated. Jenova's original forms during VIIs development were very different from her final incarnation; the original Jenova was a hostile region of the brain that would awake in people possessing certain genes. The name \\"Jenova\\" was to have been inherited by a book written by the Cetra on the subject. While Jenova's remains in Advent Children are called a \\"head\\", this is not technically accurate. The term was only used because developers couldn't think of a more suitable name. One of the ideas discussed for Sephiroth's resurrection was for the remnant to eat Jenova's remains. The disease caused by Jenova's presence in the Lifestream, Geostigma, was based on a discarded concept for Final Fantasy X.  is the former Vice President of Shinra, who is promoted to President after his father is killed by Sephiroth. Depicted as callous, cunning and ruthless during much of Final Fantasy VII, his attitudes towards how the Shinra Company should be run causes his father to attempt to bar him from ever controlling the company. As shown in Before Crisis, Rufus was anonymously supplying information to AVALANCHE, intending to have them kill his father. This failed and he is placed under house arrest. However, almost immediately upon his father's death, he claims control over the company and quickly begins running it by way of his preferred method. He later leads Shinra's efforts to find the Promised Land, as well as Shinra's military in battling the WEAPONs. Rufus was thought to have died when his office in Shinra Headquarters was hit by an energy blast from Diamond WEAPON, but in Advent Children it is revealed that he survived, albeit after sustaining great injuries. The On the Way to a Smile novella \\"Case of Shinra\\" depicts his survival, as well as his plans for the future, and how he contracts Geostigma. He appears in Advent Children in possession of Jenova's remains, and claims that he intends to repair the damage Shinra had caused to Gaia. In Advent Children, Rufus uses a wheelchair and covers himself with a white sheet, and although these are later shown to be a facade while he was holding Jenova's remains.Kazushige Nojima: The wheelchair is part of his disguise, though he was damaged by the WEAPON. While not seen in Dirge of Cerberus except in a flashback, it is hinted that he is secretly funding the WRO (World Regenesis Organization). Rufus is voiced by Wally Wingert in Advent Children and Josh Bowman in Final Fantasy VII Remake in English. He is voiced by T≈çru ≈åkawa in Japanese.  is the biological father of Sephiroth and was the head of Shinra's \\"Department of Science and Research\\" until he resigned after being attacked by Red XIII at Shinra headquarters. While studying Jenova, he infused his unborn child with its cells; the result of this was Sephiroth, who would eventually grow up to have an element of control over Jenova. He was also responsible for making Vincent immortal. In Final Fantasy VII, Hojo is defeated by Cloud and his allies while trying to aid Sephiroth's plans, but in Dirge of Cerberus, it is revealed he survived long enough to store a digital copy of himself in the worldwide network; he subsequently takes control of Weiss' body and attempts through him to summon Omega WEAPON, which will drain the Lifestream from the Planet and launch into space in search of a new world. He is stopped by Vincent with the help of Nero, who merges with Weiss and frees him from Hojo's control, destroying Hojo in the process. Hojo also briefly appears in Before Crisis, Last Order, and Crisis Core. In English he is voiced by Paul Eiding in Dirge of Cerberus and Crisis Core and James Sie in Final Fantasy VII Remake. In Japanese he is voiced by Nachi Nozawa in Dirge of Cerberus, Last Order and Crisis Core, and Shigeru Chiba in Remake. =Kadaj, Loz and Yazoo= , and are the antagonists of Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. Known as \\"Remnants\\", they are manifestations of Sephiroth's will, driven to find samples of their \\"mother\\" Jenova to trigger Sephiroth's resurrection and get vengeance upon the world. The three frequently come into conflict with the remains of Shinra and Cloud. Eventually, Kadaj is successful in merging with Jenova's cells, triggering Sephiroth's resurrection. Kadaj, like Sephiroth, is mortally wounded by Cloud and dies in his arms, while Loz and Yazoo die in a final attack on Cloud. The remnants were created to represent different aspects of Sephiroth's personality: Kadaj represented his cruelty, Loz represented his strength, and Yazoo represented his allure. To fit in with the film's theme of the \\"next generation\\", they were all made younger than Cloud and Sephiroth. Kadaj's original moniker during production was \\"Lost Name\\". Kadaj, Loz and Yazoo are respectively voiced by Steven Staley/Shotaro Morikubo, Fred Tatasciore/Kenji Nomura and Dave Wittenberg/Yuji Kishi. =Deepground= is a military force created by Shinra which acts as the antagonist of Dirge of Cerberus, created by the company using genetic engineering to be a covert force. The leaders of Deepground are the Tsviets, an elite who were infused with genetic material belonging to Genesis Rhapsodos. The Tsviets' original leaders, the Restrictors, were overthrown when the Tsviets used one of their own who had yet to be fully indoctrinated to kill the Restrictor leader. During the events of Dirge of Cerberus, they are manipulated by Hojo possessing their leader into attempting to awaken OMEGA, a means for the Lifestream to escape the planet during times of catastrophe. Although one of the members, Shelke, is rescued from the group, the others are killed, although Weiss' body is rescued by Genesis and transported somewhere. The Tsviets are: *, leader of the Tsviets and Nero's elder brother. While controlled by Hojo for most of the game, he ultimately acts as the game's true antagonist. Weiss is voiced by J≈çji Nakata in Japanese and Dave Boat in English. *, a member of the Tsviets and Weiss' younger brother. He holds the power to control darkness, and prior to the events of Dirge of Cerberus, he was kept in close confinement as his power was highly dangerous. Nero is voiced by Mike Rock in English and Ry≈çtar≈ç Okiayu in Japanese. *, a physically imposing member who acts as Shalua's handler. He first appeared in Before Crisis as a SOLDIER candidate who attracted Shinra's attention and was indoctrinated into Deepground. Azul is voiced by Brad Abrell in English and Tessh≈ç Genda in Japanese. *, a sadistic member of the group who was mentally damaged by the Deepground training program. She is the one who succeeds in extracting the Protomateria needed to activate OMEGA weapon from Vincent's body. Rosso is voiced by Mary Elizabeth McGlynn in English and Atsuko Tanaka in Japanese. * is the youngest member of the group and the younger sister of Shalua Rui. Kidnapped when she was nine years old, Shelke was experimented on: the experiments give her the ability to send her consciousness into the Planet's worldwide network, but mentally scars her and traps her in a child's body that needs constant Mako injections to stay alive. Shelke is voiced by Kari Wahlgren in English and Fumiko Orikasa in Japanese. =Genesis Rhapsodos= is a character first seen in Dirge of Cerberus who acts as the antagonist of Crisis Core. Genesis was a product of the same program that created Sephiroth, but Genesis was not as stable as Sephiroth and began suffering from a degenerative process called \\"degradation\\" after being wounded during a sparring match with Sephiroth and Angeal. Allying with a rogue Shinra scientist named Hollander, Genesis fights against the company while seeking a way to stop his degradation using Sephiroth's stable cells. Eventually, Genesis is first defeated by Zack, then cured of his degradation by the Lifestream. Genesis was taken in by Deepground, who gave him the codename \\"G\\", and used him to create the Tsviets. Refusing to follow along with the Tsviets' plans after their rebellion, he seals himself in a cave until he is needed. During the secret ending of Dirge of Cerberus, Genesis awakes, determined to protect and defend the planet. Genesis was modeled on the character's Japanese voice actor Gackt, who also composed and performed the theme songs (see \\"Redemption\\") for Dirge of Cerberus. While originally intended as a minor character cameo, Hideki Imaizumi, the producer of Crisis Core, found such a passing use of a character to be a waste and asked Gackt whether he was interested in further involvement. Gackt was eager to continue with the character, ending up being one of the key creative minds behind Genesis' manners and personality. Genesis' outfit became one of Gackt's commonly worn outfits during concerts. Genesis is voiced in English by Robin Atkin Downes in Dirge of Cerberus and Oliver Quinn in Crisis Core. Other characters =AVALANCHE= is an important eco-terrorist organization in the world of Final Fantasy VII. It is introduced as the main rebel force against Shinra, openly opposed to the company's Mako-based energy production, which is draining the planet of life. Two versions of the organization existed: the first acted as the antagonists of Before Crisis, while the second featured many of the protagonists of VII. While the first version of the movement was indirectly destroyed by the actions of their leader, Shinra eventually crush the movement completely, going to the lengths of destroying the sector seven of Midgar. Among its notable members were: *, the scientific brains of AVALANCHE and the antagonist of Before Crisis. Holding a warped view of how humans are harming the Planet, he comes to believe that humanity needs to be destroyed for the planet to heal properly. To do this, he seeks the power of Zirconiade, a powerful summoned monster. While successful in summoning Zirconiade, the summon and Fuhito are defeated by the Turks, then Fuhito is killed by Shears. * is the leader of AVALANCHE, later revealed to be Veld's lost daughter . Originally thought dead in a bungled operation during which her mother died and her town was destroyed, she was in fact taken to a Shinra facility and experimented on by Hojo, who implanted the Zirconiade materia into her body. While saved from death, she is apparently shot with her father by the Turks on orders from Shinra. The shooting was in fact a bluff to give Elf√© and Veld a chance to live in peace. *, AVALANCHE's second-in-command. Intensely loyal to Elf√© and distrustful of Fuhito, he is quick to see that Fuhito only wants to use Elf√© after finding out about the Materia she has in her. Allying with the Turks to save Elf√©, he eventually sacrifices himself to destroy Fuhito. * and are AVALANCHE members who worked with Barret and Cloud to infiltrate and destroy one of the Mako Reactors. They are killed while trying to defend sector seven's pillar. In Final Fantasy VII Remake English release, Biggs and Wedge are respectively voiced by Gideon Emery and Matt L. Jones and in the Japanese release they're voiced by Sh≈´hei Sakaguchi and Takayuki Asai. * is a member of AVALANCHE and colleague/friend of Biggs and Wedge, also involved in the destruction of the Mako Reactor and is killed along with them during the same incident. In the Final Fantasy VII Remake, Jessie has the surname \\"Rasberry\\". It is revealed that Jessie's motive for being a part of AVALANCHE is that her father was injured in an accident at Shinra and left in a coma. She also becomes a potential love interest for Cloud with various flirtateous interactions. In Final Fantasy VII Remake, she is voiced by Erica Lindbeck in the English release and Satomi Moriya in the Japanese release. =Reeve Tuesti= is the former head of Shinra's \\"Department of Urban Development\\", and is controller of the robotic cat Cait Sith. In Final Fantasy VII, Reeve originally worked against AVALANCHE, until later deciding to help them in their quest against Sephiroth: feeling repentant about his role, he aids the group through Cait Sith. He is temporarily arrested after Rufus' apparent death, but is released in time to organize an evacuation of Midgar's population before the arrival of Meteor. He also brings the news of Aerith's death to Elmyra Gainsborough, the adoptive mother of Aerith. Reeve plays a minor role in Before Crisis, as the architect responsible for designing Mako reactors and aiding the Turks with the use of Cait Sith. He is not seen in Advent Children, but is heard leaving a message on Cloud's cell phone. He plays a significant role in Dirge of Cerberus, where he has established the World Regenesis Organization, which is dedicated to restoring the Planet. He also appears in the On the Way to a Smile novella \\"Case of Denzel\\" and its OVA adaptation On the Way to a Smile - Episode: Denzel. He is voiced by Jamieson Price in every major appearance and by Jon Root in Final Fantasy VII Remake in English and by Banj≈ç Ginga in Japanese. =Marlene= is the young daughter of Barret's friends, Dyne and Eleanor, and the adopted daughter of Barret. Eleanor was killed by an attack from Shinra prior to the events of Final Fantasy VII, and Dyne assumes Marlene to be dead as well. In actuality, Barret adopts her, thinking Dyne is dead. Barret later encounters Dyne, who has gone insane. After fighting Barret, Dyne entrusts Marlene to Barret's care and commits suicide. For most of Final Fantasy VII, Marlene is left in the care of Elmyra, Aerith's adopted mother. During Advent Children, she lives with Cloud, Tifa, and Denzel, while Barret is searching for a new power source for the Planet. She is instrumental in making Cloud return to his friends and continue fighting against Sephiroth's Remnants. Marlene is voiced by Grace Rolek in English and Miy≈´ Tsuzurahara in Japanese. In Advent Children Complete, she is voiced by Ariel Winter in English and by Sumire Morohoshi in Japanese. In Final Fantasy VII Remake she is voiced by Brielle Milla in English =Shalua Rui= is a minor character in Before Crisis and a supporting character in Dirge of Cerberus. When her sister Shelke was taken by Shinra for their Deepground unit, Shalua went in search of Shelke, joining AVALANCHE in the hope that they would lead her to her sister. During her time there, she received grave injuries resulting in the loss of her right eye and arm, and massive internal damage. This incident prompted her to leave AVALANCHE for good. In Dirge of Cerberus, she is part of the World Regenesis Organization, and is responsible for saving Vincent after he is overcome by the power of Chaos. She is eventually plunged into a coma while she is helping Vincent and Shelke escape and her life support mechanism, her artificial arm, is destroyed. Her ultimate fate is not specified. Shalua is voiced by Kim Mai Guest in English and Yuu Asakawa in Japanese. =Angeal Hewley= is a SOLDIER 1st Class who is Zack Fair's friend and mentor, the original owner of the Buster Sword, and a close friend of Genesis and Sephiroth. Produced by the same project that birthed Genesis, when he finds out about his origins, he turns against Shinra and works with Genesis for a time. As he begins suffering from the same degradation as Genesis, he begins seeing himself as a monster and leaves Genesis, temporarily allying with Zack. Zack is eventually forced to fight and kill him. Angeal lives on for a while through Lazard Deusericus, the former director of SOLDIER who is made a copy of Angeal, and an animal-like copy. Both eventually die after protecting Cloud from a Shinra attack in Banora. Angeal is voiced by Josh Gilman in English and Kazuhiko Inoue in Japanese. =Lucrecia Crescent= is a Shinra scientist first introduced in VII who acts as an important character in Dirge of Cerberus. A scientist working in Nibelheim under Hojo, she worked on the research into Chaos, which she injected into Vincent while he was a Turk assigned to protect her, and provided the maternal DNA for Sephiroth. Ridden with guilt over her actions, she seals herself inside a crystal, essentially becoming immortal and virtually cut off from the outside world. Her memories are uploaded into Shelke, and through them and recordings left behind for him, she is able to communicate with Vincent, eventually leaving a final message that she is glad he survived. Lucrecia was originally a fairly minor character in VII. It was hard for the staff to recreate her for Dirge of Cerberus as they needed to rely on low-detail concept art and in-game models. To create the new model of Lucrecia, the concept team used Sephiroth's appearance as a base, deciding that the latter would have a maternal rather than paternal resemblance. Lucrecia is voiced by April Stewart in English and Rio Natsuki in Japanese. =Denzel= is a young boy who resides with Cloud, Tifa, and Marlene in the city of Edge. He first appears in Advent Children as a sufferer of the incurable disease Geostigma. He and many other sick children are lured to the Ancient City of the Cetra, where they are brought under Kadaj's control. Denzel regains his senses after Tifa protects him from Bahamut SIN during the final conflict. He is later healed of his Geostigma by drinking the water in Aerith's church. In Advent Children, Denzel is voiced by Benjamin Bryan in English and Kyosuke Ikeda in Japanese, and Advent Children Complete, he is voiced by Aaron Refvem in English and Kazumu Izawa in Japanese. Reception =Critical reception= The characters of VII received near- unanimous praise from critics for their original appearance. In an article on GameSpot, it was stated that, despite the premise not being unique, it was \\"Cloud's interactions with other characters, especially between him and [Sephiroth] which make the story so special\\". Thierry Nguyen of Computer Gaming World found that both the story and character development were strong, saying that as the players progressed through the game, \\"these characters intrigue you, and you get so attached to them that you might jump as a reaction to a shocking event on the first disc. Final Fantasy VII evokes that kind of emotional response.\\" Steve Bauman of Computer Games Magazine called the characters \\"funky\\", saying that the characters \\"worked wonders\\" on some of the poorer dialogue. Simon Parkin of Eurogamer praised the characters' \\"clear motivations, desires and flaws\\". RPGFan generally praised the characters, especially Cloud, Tifa and Sephiroth, and said that \\"while on the surface they certainly do appear to fit certain stereotypes, a second look will reveal that they transcend these qualities and are compelling and complex personalities underneath.\\" While the mobile game Before Crisis, the first Compilation game title to be released, has received limited western commentary, writers at AnimeFringe felt that \\"the chance to reverse the good and bad guy roles should be welcomed by many.\\" Advent Children received mixed views from critics. Carlo Santos of Anime News Network felt that, due to the film's pace and context, viewers were not given enough time to get to know the characters. These sentiments were echoed by John Eriani of Mania Entertainment, who particularly faulted the lack of character names or explanations of the villains' motives. Chris Carle of IGN was critical of the lack of motivation for those who were not familiar with the series, but praised both the English and Japanese voice acting. Michael Beckett of RPGamer, while generally less than impressed by the overall story, said that it \\"[provides] some interesting insights into a few of the less-developed characters of the game, though Cloud receives most of the attention and development as the story unfolds\\". Opinions on the characters of Dirge of Cerberus were again mixed to positive. IGN's Jeremy Dunham was fairly positive, saying that the new characters \\"go through quite a bit of development and even some of the old ones have a chance to shine\\". He was also pleased with Vincent's portrayal and development in the title. Rob Fahey of Eurogamer felt that the focus on characters that were secondary or optional in the original was a weak point of the game, and that those not familiar with the original game would possibly feel lost. GameSpot's Greg Mueller praised the game's focus on Vincent's origins and development, despite finding the large number of new characters a little confusing. Crisis Cores characters were generally praised. GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd said that, despite new and familiar characters appearing, it was the further-explored characters of Zack and Sephiroth that he found himself sympathising with: \\"The way their personal stories weave in and out of each other‚Äîand set the stage for the events in Final Fantasy VII‚Äîmakes Crisis Core not just the finest role-playing experience available on the PSP, but also one of the best Japanese RPGs in years.\\" Ryan Clements, writing for IGN, was pleased by the story's focus on Zack and his interactions with other characters rather than a grand narrative. Gerard Villorria of GameSpy was also positive, saying that exploring the relationships between old characters was \\"a key element\\", while finding the new characters and their backstories \\"equally interesting\\". In regards to remake, IGN called its \\"emotional arcs\\". Despite noting his antisocial attitudes in the remake, IGN and GameSpot commented that Cloud is the character who has the most notable arc in Remake, with Cody Christian's performance helping to improve his appeal. The idea that there are four characters with Sephiroth's name led VG247 to note the remake still had its own mysteries that original players would not understand while the title. Siliconera described this incarnation of the antagonist as haunting, due to how he often appears within Cloud's hallucinations across the plot. Still, the site noticed that despite being a remake, the game explored different situations of the narrative similar to the films known as Rebuild of Evangelion that also retold an anime but with multiple changes. The portrayal of the supporting characters also earned positive response such as the potential Barret was given to develop him in the sequel or Aerith's traits and some ambiguous scenes involving her. =Legacy= The characters of Final Fantasy VII and the Compilation have remained highly popular, often being cited as some of the best characters in both the Final Fantasy series and video games in general by both critics and fans. Reader and critic lists on gaming site IGN have all placed them high, with one reader poll in 2014 having multiple VII characters dominating a list of the top ten characters in the series as a whole. Sephiroth remains one of the most popular villains in video game history, unanimously voted number one by the staff of Electronic Gaming Monthly in their \\"Top 10 Video Game Bosses\\" list in October 2005. In late 2007, Dengeki PlayStation named Cloud Strife the best character of all time in their retrospective awards feature about the original PlayStation. Aerith placed fifth, Tifa placed eighth and three other characters placed in the top 50; Sephiroth at fourteenth, Reno at fifteenth, and Yuffie at forty-second. Cloud placed second in a Famitsu reader poll for Japan's favorite video game character. In a list of the best Final Fantasy characters made by Complex, characters from Final Fantasy VII occupied seven out of the twenty places, with Sephiroth and Cloud coming third and first respectively. The character of Cloud has also influenced character design in the series, having had a profound influence on the design and portrayal of Lightning, the central protagonist of Final Fantasy XIII and its sequels.

After the war the building at Howard Gardens was partially repaired.Cardiff Schools & the Age of the Second World War, The Log Books: A Documentary History 1938-1945, Keith Strange, (undated document) A new technical school was opened in September 1953 with around 200 boys. It was officially named ‚ÄòFitzalan Technical High School‚Äô in December 1953. The Howard Gardens site was to be re-developed (as Cardiff School of Art & Design) and Fitzalan Technical High School acquired new premises on the present site in Lawrenny Avenue, Canton, Cardiff which were opened on Tuesday 3 March 1964. In January 1968 the school was renamed Fitzalan High School (dropping 'Technical'), becoming a comprehensive school. It was announced in 2017 that Fitzalan High School would be one of three major secondary schools in Cardiff to be completely rebuilt and replaced as part of City of Cardiff Council's ¬£284 million improvement plans. Organisation and communications Pupils are grouped according to their abilities with the more able pupils placed in an express set. Pupils with special educational needs receive specialist support in class to ensure that they can access the curriculum fully.FITZALAN HIGH PROSPECTUS 2010 The school has four Houses: Dewi, Llewellyn, Glyndwr, and Hywel. The school has a website, and issues a regular newsletter on school activities. A School Council exists for pupils to raise any issues through this forum. It has many community links and local residents and interest groups, who are allowed to use the extensive facilities. The school has an established and published policy on 'anti- bullying' for all pupils. A Parent Teacher Association (PTA) was formed in 1978 called the ‚ÄòFriends of Fitzalan‚Äõ. It supports the school, raises funds, and helps organise social events. In 2007 the school embarked on a program to reduce its carbon footprint after an audit by the Carbon Trust. Steps taken included installing \\"eco-quiet\\" computers, one of which was to be powered by a demonstration wind turbine. The school was awarded the NAACE Mark for excellence in the use of ICT in November 2005. ;Organised Sports and Arts The school campus includes two gymnasia, a multi use dance studio, two indoor multi-use halls, two fitness suites, a sports hall, a swimming pool, four grass football and rugby pitches and an artificial cricket square. In addition daily access to the Gol Centre, comprising twelve five-a-side artificial football pitches, the Welsh International Athletics Stadium and artificial sports pitches. BTEC sport lessons take place both in the school and in Cardiff City Football Club. * In 1982, the school football team won the English Schools Football Association Cup, the first time that this cup had been taken out of England. * Fitzalan has traditionally had a strong chess team, winning the Welsh Schools Championship in 1984 and 1985, and in 2001 and 2002. * The school hall was used during filming for \\"School Reunion\\", an episode of the long-running British science fiction series Doctor Who, first aired on 29 April 2006. * A BBC2 documentary called \\"Fitzalan ‚Äî School of Dreams\\" was filmed in March 2006. * The school transformed one of its gyms into a drama studio complete with brand new apparatus =Results= In January 2020 a class of sixteen-year-olds, who had had the same maths teacher since they started the school in year 7, all passed their maths GCSE six months ahead of schedule and all achieved A*, the top grade. Only 13% of pupils in Wales who had sat the WJEC GCSE the previous year had achieved A or A*. The achievement was widely reported in the British and international media with the teacher Francis Elive described as 'The Maths Whisperer'.  Facilities  * A ¬£300,000 refurbishment of the school's twenty-metre swimming pool, and named the Peter Perkins Swimming Pool in memory of the former chair of governors. It was officially opened in March 2009. Facilities are open to the local community after school hours. As part of the joint venture between the Sport Wales, City of Cardiff Council‚Äôs Active Communities team and the school, a disused classroom has been turned into a fitness suite and multi-gym facility. * Fitzalan was the first school to install state-of-the-art 5-a-side astro pitches (identical to that of Real Madrid), in partnership with G√¥l Football Centres, and a new ¬£600,000 sports hall. The hall has many uses, including Cricket, Football, Basketball, Netball, Tennis and Badminton. * Two new full-sized astro pitches were recently completed, and are located next to the Leckwith Athletic stadium. * The school introduced a new 5x60 regime ‚Äì a Sport Wales programme aimed at increasing the number of secondary age pupils taking part in sport or physical activity for 60 minutes, at least five times a week.

Among the offices of State located in the building are: *Department of the Taoiseach *Council Chamber (cabinet room) *Office of the Attorney General *Department of Finance *Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Origins Sir Aston Webb, architect of the new Royal College of Science The building that was to become Government Buildings was the last major public building constructed under British rule in what is now the Republic of Ireland. The foundation stone for the building was laid by King Edward VII in 1904. It was built on the site of a row of Georgian houses that were being controversially demolished one by one as the new building was erected. The building itself was designed by Sir Aston Webb, a British architect who was later to redesign the fa√ßade of Buckingham Palace. The final completed building was opened by King George V in 1911. It was owned by the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction, an agency of the Dublin Castle administration, and intended for use by the Royal College of Science. In June 1921, the Council Room was chosen as the location for the first meeting of the new Parliament of Southern Ireland, created under the Government of Ireland Act 1920. It proved a fiasco, as only 4 of 128 members of the House of Commons turned up, and 15 of the 64 Senators. With the coming into existence of the Irish Free State in December 1922, Leinster House, the headquarters of the Royal Dublin Society, located next door to the Royal College of Science, became the provisional seat of the Free State's parliament, Oireachtas Shaorst√°t √âireann. The Executive Council of the Irish Free State immediately commandeered part of the college as temporary office space. Two years later, the Free State decided to buy Leinster House outright from the RDS. Government usage of part of the Royal College of Science also became permanent. =Original government buildings (1922‚Äì1991)= From 1922 to 1991, the former Royal College of Science building was divided between a number of bodies. The wing to the right of the main entrance (the north wing) was used by the Department of the President, later in 1938 renamed Department of the Taoiseach. The Attorney General, the Department of Justice and Equality and other offices also occupied that wing of the building. The south wing was occupied permanently by the Department of Finance. The centre block of the courtyard under the dome was still used by the Royal College of Science, and later when it merged with University College, Dublin, by students from the Faculty of Engineering. Over the decades, some departments moved out to purpose built offices, leaving the north wing for the Taoiseach, Government Secretariat and Attorney General. Current Government Buildings Government Buildings by night In the mid-1980s, increasingly unhappy at the cramped office space, Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald decided to convert the entire building for government use. This policy was implemented by his successor, Charles Haughey, who had the state sell a block of Georgian houses across the road, which up to then had been in state ownership, for ¬£17 million to fund the rebuild. A new engineering faculty was also built on University College, Dublin's Belfield campus at tens of millions of pounds. Military Police soldier on duty at Government Buildings Much of the original interior of the original building was gutted to facilitate the creation of a state-of-the-art new government office. Haughey finally moved into the new building in 1991. Critics of the expenditure, at a time when the Republic of Ireland was in financial difficulties, nicknamed the building the Chaz Mahal. However, criticism of the redesigned building soon died away and it won major architectural awards for its design, with world leaders like British Prime Minister John Major praising it to then Taoiseach Albert Reynolds when he visited the building to meet him. The entrance hall is dominated by light streaming through Evie Hone's critically acclaimed stained glass window, My Four Green Fields. The new building included a state-of-the-art suite of offices for the Taoiseach and staff, a set of committee rooms, new offices, canteen facilities, a helicopter pad and a new press briefing room. Originally the Office of Public Works had planned a new cabinet suite of rooms also. However, the Government opted to continue to use the Council Chamber which had been the cabinet room for all Irish governments since 1922. Government Buildings are protected by the Garda S√≠och√°na and an armed company from the Military Police Corps.

The name is a reference to the former Forest of Arden. In the 2001 census the town had a population of 2,011, increasing to 2,074 at the 2011 census. Henley is known for its variety of historic buildings, some of which date back to medieval times, and its wide variety of preserved architectural styles. The one-mile-long (1.6 km) High Street is a conservation area. Location and geography Henley-in-Arden is approximately 9 miles west of the county town of Warwick, 15 miles southeast of Birmingham, 9 miles east of Redditch and 9 miles north of Stratford upon Avon (where the road between Stratford and Henley was named Henley Street). (in a footnote) It is located in a valley of the River Alne, which separates Henley from the adjacent settlement of Beaudesert. Henley and Beaudesert effectively form a single entity, and share a joint parish council, although Beaudesert is a separate civil parish. The town lies at a crossroads between the A3400 and the A4189 roads and is the starting point for the circular Arden Way path. It also lies on the Heart of England Way. Henley Sidings is a nature reserve managed by the Warwickshire Wildlife Trust. In the 2001 census the population of the civil parish of Henley-in-Arden was 2,011.ONS Neighbourhood statistics Whilst the population of its urban area which includes Beaudesert was 2,797.2001 urban areas headcounts History Aerial photo of Henley-in-Arden Henley-in-Arden is not listed in the Domesday Book and may not have existed until the 12th century. The first record of the town is in a legal instrument drawn during the reign of Henry II. It was originally a hamlet of Wootton Wawen, on Feldon Street, the original route out of the Forest of Arden. In the 11th century, a Thurstan de Montfort constructed Beaudesert Castle, a motte and bailey castle, on the hill above Beaudesert. In 1140, the Empress Matilda granted the right to hold a market at the castleA History of the County of Warwick, URL: http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=56979 Date accessed: 24 November 2011. and Henley soon became a prosperous market town, conveniently located on the busy Birmingham-to-Stratford road. In 1220 in the reign of Henry III, the lord of the manor, Peter de Montfort, procured the grant of a weekly Monday marketWilliam Dugdale The Antiquities of Warwickshire, 1656 and an annual fair to last two days, for the town. The initial prosperity came to an end however during the Second Barons' War when, in 1265, Peter de Montfort died fighting at the Battle of Evesham. The royalist forces won, and the town and castle were burnt in reprisal. The town and castle recovered however and Henley became a borough in 1296. In 1315 all of the recorded townsfolk were freemen. The King stayed at the castle for 7 days in January 1324. By 1336 the market was so prosperous that the inhabitants were able to obtain a licence from Edward III to impose a local sales tax on all goods brought to the market, for a period of three years, in order to pay for the cost of paving the streets. The Lord of the Manor, Peter de Montfort 3rd Baron Montfort, as Commissioner of Array for Warwickshire sent 160 archers to the Battle of Crecy during the Hundred Years' War in 1346. By the 15th century, the lords of the manor were the Boteler family. Ralph Boteler, 1st Baron Sudeley obtained a charter from Henry VI in 1449, confirming the grant of the new weekly market, and a grant for two annual fairs. The Guild Hall of Henley-in-Arden The town suffered another misfortune during the English Civil War, when in 1643 Prince Rupert who was in charge of the Royalist forces, marched his soldiers through the town in 1643 on his way to Birmingham and pillaged the neighbourhood.'Parishes: Henley-in-Arden', A History of the County of Warwick: Volume 3: Barlichway hundred (1945), pp. 206-212. URL: http://www.british- history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=57012 Date accessed: 8 January 2012. As a non-chartered market town, Henley's administration was based upon a manorial court. Under the lord of the manor were a high bailiff, a low bailiff, a third-borough, a constable, and pairs of ale-tasters, Chamberlains, leathersealers, brook lookers, fieldreeves, and affearors. These local borough officials were chosen annually by a meeting of former bailiffs and constables, and were members of the jury of the biannual court leet. The bailiff, accompanied by his predecessors, would formally open the annual town fair. The town hall was inherited from a medieval Guild. The records of the court leet and the court baron in Henley date from 1592 onwards. The court rolls are largely concerned with (in Dyer's words) modest problems, such as preventing the poor from migrating into the town (which burgers considered would become a burden on the rates and result in the destruction of hedges for fuel), the ringing of loose pigs, and the prevention of horses being parked in the streets. The poor were a significant problem for Henley's court leet. In the early 17th century there was a marked increase in the landless poor, squatting on commons and on wasteland in the Forest of Arden, and such people were generally regarded as violent and criminal by townsfolk. Between 1590 and 1620 there were a disproportionate number of people, relative to the size of the population, presented by the court leet for engaging in violent affray, something which Underdown states to be \\"surely no coincidence\\". In Love's Labours Lost Rosaline says \\"Better wits have worn plain Statute Caps.\\". This is believed to be a reference to events in Henley during the writing of that play, before its publication, when the denizens of Henley were prosecuted in the court leet for being in breach of a statute (enacted with the aim of ensuring economic support for the wool industry) that required the wearing of woollen caps on Sundays and other holy days. By 1814, Henley had a weekly market every Monday, three annual fairs (on Lady Day; on Tuesday in Whitsunday-week, for cattle; and on 29 October for horses, cattle, sheep, and hops), and a population in 1811 (according to returns made to Parliament) of 1,055 (with 242 inhabited houses and 12 uninhabited houses). Although the castle no longer remains, several other historical buildings and structures still exist in the town, such as the parish churches of St. Nicholas and St. John the Baptist, the 15th century Guildhall (which has been restored), the medieval market cross (much of the decoration of whose shaft has been mutilated but which has three ranges of kneeling places and sculptures representing the Holy Trinity, the cruxifixion of Jesus, and, it is believed, St Peter), the 16th century White Swan, and several half timbered residences along High Street, the main street of the town. = Lunatic asylums = Historically, Henley has had several private lunatic asylums. The first was licensed in 1744, which housed pauper lunatics at the expense of the parish. Another was run by Thomas Burman in 1795, who charged \\"one guinea/week for board and medicines, the patient finding their own linen and washing. If any person chuses a servant constantly to attend on them, board and wages are separately considered.\\". Transport British Railways Western Region \\"totem\\" for Henley-in-Arden station.

Biography Boutell was born at Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Lewis Henry and Anna (Greene) Boutell. A colonial ancestry entitled him to membership in the Sons of the American Revolution and in the Society of Colonial Wars. He was also an hereditary member of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. His college education was secured at Northwestern (A.B. 1874, M.A. 1879) and Harvard (A.B. 1876, A.M. 1877). After studying law in an office, in 1879 he was admitted to the bar and began practice in Chicago. Although both able and prominent as an attorney (representing, for example, the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad in securing a right of way into Chicago, and in the erection of its terminal therein), his tastes from the beginning ran to public life, and he was soon both active and useful as a worker in the Republican Party. In 1884 he was a member of the lower house of the state legislature, and from 1897 to 1911 a representative of Chicago districts in Congress. There he was a member of the committees on Rules, and on Ways and Means, and was chairman of the Committee on Expenditures of the Navy. He was an effective speaker and of considerable influence, but his tariff views were unacceptable to business interests in Chicago, which forced his retirement. President William Howard Taft then appointed him to the post of Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Portugal, on March 2, 1911. He never assumed its duties, and on April 24, 1911, he was given a similar appointment to Switzerland. In this post he served from May 17, 1911, to July 31, 1913. He did not find the diplomatic service to his liking, and resigned. Before he did so he had declined the chief justiceship of the United States court of claims tendered him by President Taft (January 1913). With this his public career ended, except for service (November 1913) as chairman of a board of arbitration which settled an important dispute between the operatives and officers of the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad. From 1914 to 1923 he taught constitutional law and international law in Georgetown University, in Washington, D.C. He was short of stature, very erect and dignified of carriage, alert in movement. Distinctly of the scholarly type, he was very widely read, and active, so long as he resided in Chicago, in the Literary Club of that city. His speeches, which reflected his reading, were always graceful and sometimes eloquent. In his political opinions he was fairly liberal, but in the regulation of purely personal affairs and conduct he was notably conservative. He was a rare combination of force and urbanity. Although unfailingly careful to avoid giving offense to anybody with whom he came in contact, invariably gracious, and charming in manner, his opinions were not lacking in definiteness, and he was not in any way colorless. These qualities should have won him great distinction either in law or diplomacy, but in politics they left him merely a staunch and dependable \\"party\\" man, whose mental independence and natural talents were hampered by party platforms. He did not win in public life the renown of which his abilities and early professional success gave promise. On December 29, 1880, he was married to Euphemia Lucia Clara Gates of Providence, Rhode Island. He died at Sanremo, Italy. Several children survived him. He was the great nephew of William M. Evarts, great grandson of Jeremiah Evarts and the great-great grandson of Roger Sherman. His father Lewis Henry Boutell (July 21, 1826 ‚Äì January 16, 1899) wrote the book, The Life of Roger Sherman (Chicago: A.C. McClurg and Co., 1896) References *\\"Henry Sherman Boutell\\".

He is also a notable proponent of analytical Marxism, and a critic of neoclassical economics and public choice theory, largely on behavioral and psychological grounds. In 2016, he was awarded the 22nd Johan Skytte Prize in Political Science for his contributions to political science. Biography Elster earned his PhD in 1972 from the Paris Descartes University in Paris with a dissertation on Karl Marx under the direction of Raymond Aron. Elster was a member of the September Group for many years but left in the early 1990s. Elster previously taught at the University of Oslo in the department of history and held an endowed chair at the University of Chicago, teaching in the departments of philosophy and political science. He is now Robert K. Merton Professor of Social Sciences with appointments in Political Science and Philosophy at Columbia University and professeur honoraire at the Coll√®ge de France. He was awarded the Jean Nicod Prize in 1997 and the Skytte Prize in Political Science in 2016. He is a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters. He is also a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, of the American Philosophical Society, of the Academia Europaea, and a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy. He is the son of journalist/author and CEO of the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation Torolf Elster and poet Magli Elster. Elster is doctor honoris causa at the universities of Valencia, Stockholm, Oslo, Trondheim (NTNU), Louvain-la-Neuve, Torcuato di Tella, and the National University of Colombia. He is honorary professor at the University of Chongqing. Philosophical work Much of Elster's writing is characterized by attempts to use analytical theories, especially rational choice theory, as a springboard for philosophical and ethical analysis, with numerous examples from literature and history. \\"Elster has made important contributions to several fields,\\" Daniel Little wrote in a review essay. \\"The breadth and depth of his writings are striking in a time of high specialisation; he is read and discussed by political scientists, legal scholars, economists and philosophers. His work is difficult to summarise in a slogan, but ... it is generally informed by a broad and deep acquaintance with relevant literature in economics, political science, history, philosophy, and psychology.\\"Chapter on Jon Elster by Daniel Little in New Horizons in Economic Thought: Appraisals of Leading Economists, edited by Warren Samuels (Edward Elgar Publishing, 1992) . Also available as download A student of the philosophy of social science (a topic he investigated through case studies in Explaining Technical Change), Elster strongly argued that social scientific explanations had to be built on top of methodological individualism (the belief that only individuals, not larger entities like \\"organizations\\" or \\"societies\\", can actually do things) and microfoundations (explaining big societal changes in terms of individual actions). He criticized Marxists and other social scientists for believing in functionalism (the belief that institutions exist because of their effect on society) and instead tried to give Marxism a foundation in game theory (the economic notion that people make choices based on the expected benefits and the choices others are likely to make). Elster wrote numerous books attempting to use rational choice theory for a wide variety of social explanations. \\"Rational choice theory is far more than a technical tool for explaining behaviour,\\" he once wrote. \\"It is also, and very importantly, a way of coming to grips with ourselves - not only what we should do, but even what we should be.\\" He attempted to apply it to topics as varied as politics (Political Psychology), bias and constrained preferences (Sour Grapes), emotions (Alchemies of the Mind), self-restraint (Ulysses and the Sirens, which was selected for the Norwegian Sociology Canon), Marxism (Making Sense of Marx), and more. In doing so, he elucidated many issues with simplistic notions of rational choice: endogenous preference formation (certain actions today can change preferences tomorrow, so how does one decide which preferences one prefers?), framing (people express different preferences when the same question is asked different ways), imperfect rationality (weakness of the will, emotion, impulsiveness, habit, self-deception) and our adjustments for it, and time preferences, among others. As time went on Elster began to sour on rational choice. A 1991 review in the London Review of Books noted \\"Elster has lost his bearings, or at least his faith. [His latest books], he says, 'reflects an increasing disillusion with the power of reason'.\\"Hollis, Martin, Why Elster is stuck and needs to recover his faith, London Review of Books, 13 January 1991 His magisterial 500-page book Explaining Social Behavior includes something of a recantation: The book discusses both rational behavior, but also irrational behavior, which Elster says is \\"widespread and frequent [but] not inevitable ... we want to be rational\\".Explaining Social Behaviour, p. 232 A more recent book, Le d√©sint√©ressement (part of a two-volume Trait√© critique de l‚Äôhomme √©conomique), explores the ramifications of these insights for the possibility of disinterested action.Review of Le d√©sint√©ressement, by Gloria Origgi, The Possibility of Disinterested Action, The Berlin Review of Books, 8 January 2010.

Designed by Flatow and Moore and completed in 1954, it was the city's first large-scale modernist building and is regarded as \\"Albuquerque‚Äôs best example of the International Style\\". The building was added to the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties in 1997 and the National Register of Historic Places in 1998, only 44 years after it was completed. At in height, the 13-story building was the tallest in New Mexico until the Bank of New Mexico Building was completed across the street in 1961. Its design was inspired by the latest trends in modern architecture, especially the Lever House in New York City, with glass curtain walls and a combination of vertical and horizontal volumes. Sandstone blocks from the previous building on the site, the Commercial Club, were included in the exterior walls. The Simms Building also included an innovative radiant heating and cooling system with limited solar heating capabilities. The building received attention nationally as well as locally and helped catalyze the modern architecture movement in New Mexico. History The Simms Building was commissioned in 1952 by banker and former Congressman Albert G. Simms, who had owned the old Commercial Club building on the site since 1932. To design the building, he hired Max Flatow and Jason Moore, whose recently established firm Flatow and Moore would become one of the largest in New Mexico. In fact, the Simms Building was their first major project as partners. Simms initially planned to build a four- or five-story building, but when the architects showed him a more ambitious 12-story proposal he decided to go ahead with the project even though he felt it was a \\"crazy idea\\". The Simms Building replaced the Richardsonian Romanesque Commercial Club, built in 1892. Some of the sandstone blocks were reused in the new building. Flatow and Moore designed a bold International style tower, reflecting the latest trends in modern architecture; the style had only recently been adapted to highrise buildings like the Lake Shore Drive Apartments (1951) and United Nations Building (1952). Their design drew particular inspiration from the Lever House in New York City, especially the glass curtain walls and the way the tower seemed to float above its horizontal base. While embracing a futuristic design, the architects also chose to keep a link to the past by reusing sandstone blocks from the Commercial Club in some of the ground-floor exterior walls. The Simms Building was intended to be a symbol of progress and modernity for the growing city of Albuquerque. with Construction on the building started in September 1952 and was finished just over two years later in November 1954. The original construction cost was about $2 million. The new building was the tallest in New Mexico, surpassing the First National Bank Building, and boasted novel features like the first use of Thermopane insulating glass in the southwest and an innovative radiant panel heating and cooling system. The Simms Building attracted notice both locally and nationally‚Äîit was featured in its own issue of Albuquerque Progress, a monthly journal published by Albuquerque National Bank, and it was written up in the national publications Progressive Architecture in 1955 (with photos by Julius Shulman) and Architectural Forum in 1957. According to the Progressive Architecture piece, The building was sold to Sandia Savings and Loan Association in 1973 for $1.75 million and was renamed Sandia Savings Building, though the Simms name persisted in local usage. Sandia Savings made a number of changes to the building, enclosing the open-air promenade on the 13th floor for more office space, expanding the ground-level retail area, and adding a multilevel parking garage. The projects added about of space and cost $1.6 million. In 1993 it was given minor renovations and the official name was changed to Simms Tower. A more thorough, $7 million renovation was completed in 2014, including upgrades to the plumbing, electrical, and HVAC systems while maintaining the building's historic character. The building was added to the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties in 1997 and the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. The building was considered \\"exceptionally significant\\", justifying its inclusion even though it was only 44 years old at the time. Architecture The entrance of the Simms Building, including a section of wall built from reused sandstone from the Commercial Club Designed by the firm of Flatow and Moore, the Simms Building was one of the first International style buildings in Albuquerque (one earlier example, albeit on a much smaller scale, is John Gaw Meem's Southern Union Gas Company Building built in 1951). The building is tall and has 13 floors supported by a reinforced concrete frame with 24 columns in a 3-by-8 grid. The ground floor covers most of the block and includes a small courtyard on the north side; most of the exterior walls are aluminum-framed glass but some portions use the recycled sandstone from the Commercial Club. The second story is recessed flush with the structural columns and again mostly glass. Above this is the main ten-story block of the building, faced with a steel-framed curtain wall of Thermopane glass and aluminum panels on the north and south sides, and brick over structural clay tile on the windowless east and west sides. It projects over the ground floor to form covered arcades at the east and west ends, with three columns on each side exposed as pilotis. The recessed thirteenth floor is modeled after the first floor and was added in the 1970s by enclosing the open promenade that originally topped the building. As Albuquerque's first modernist highrise, the building's architecture was very influential locally. For instance, the nearby New Mexico Bank & Trust Building has a very similar design, and many other buildings in the city were inspired either directly or indirectly by the Simms Building. Mechanical system Upon opening in 1954, the Simms Building had an innovative heating and cooling system designed by the engineering firm of Bridgers and Paxton. During normal operation, groundwater from onsite deep wells, available at year-round, was heated or cooled as needed using a heat pump and then circulated through radiant panels built into the exterior curtain walls. In winter, the system could also take advantage of solar heating, in effect using the building's sunny southern side as a giant solar collector which could then provide heat to the northern side. At times, the heating and cooling loads were balanced so that the system could operate self- sufficiently on solar energy alone. This idea was developed further in the all-solar heating system Bridgers and Paxton designed two years later for their pioneering Solar Building. While the system was efficient, it was not without problems. The fact that spent water from the system was re-deposited in the ground after use meant that additives could not be used without contaminating the groundwater, and corrosion soon became an issue. Eventually, it was converted to a closed system in 1965. Afterwards, the system was not properly maintained and stopped working in the 1970s. It was ultimately replaced with conventional heating and cooling systems, somewhat ironically just as the original design was attracting renewed attention due to the 1970s energy crisis. In popular culture The Simms Building appeared frequently in the popular AMC series Breaking Bad, where it portrayed the DEA office of character Agent Hank Schrader.

A reef break is an area in the ocean where waves start to break once they reach the shallows of a reef. Pipeline is known for huge waves that break in shallow water just above a sharp and cavernous reef, forming large, hollow, thick curls of water that surfers can tube ride. There are three reefs at Pipeline in progressively deeper water farther out to sea that activate according to the increasing size of approaching ocean swells. Origin of the name The location's compound name combines the name of the surf break (Pipeline) with the name of the beach fronting it (Banzai Beach). It got its name in December 1961, when surfing legend producer Bruce Brown was driving up north with Californians Phil Edwards and Mike Diffenderfer. Bruce stopped at the then-unnamed site to film Phil catching several waves. At the time, there was a construction project on an underground pipeline on adjacent Kamehameha Highway, and Mike made the suggestion to name the break \\"Pipeline\\". The name was first used in Bruce Brown's movie Surfing Hollow Days. It also lent its name to a 1963 hit Pipeline by surf music rockers The Chantays. Specifics of the break The reef at Pipe is a flat tabletop reef, with several caverns on the inside, creating a giant air bubble that pops on the front of the wave when the wave lurches upwards just before breaking. There are also several jagged, underwater lava spires that can injure fallen surfers. Sand can accumulate on the reef at Pipeline, and that can cause waves to \\"close out\\" (meaning the hollow tube of the wave collapses all at once and thus is impossible to surf). A strong swell (a formation of long-wavelength surface waves) from the west clears out the sand in the reef, and after that, a strong north swell can give rise to the best waves. There are four waves associated with Pipeline. The left (which means the wave breaks from left to right from the perspective of a watcher on shore) known as Pipeline (a.k.a. First Reef) is the most commonly surfed and photographed. When the reef is hit by a north swell, the peak (the highest tipping-point of the wave where it begins to curl) becomes an A-frame shaped wave, with Pipe closing out a bit and peeling off left, and the equally famous Backdoor Pipeline peeling away to the right at the same time. As the size at Pipe increases, over 12 feet usually, Second Reef on the outside (further out into the deeper ocean waters) starts breaking, with longer walls (the unbroken face of the wave that the surfer slides across), and more size. At an extreme size an area called Third Reef even further outside starts to break with giant waves. Shredders Numerous surfers and photographers have been killed at Pipeline, including Jon Mozo and Tahitian Malik Joyeux, who was famous for his heavy charging (gutsy surfing) at Teahupo'o. Many people have died or been seriously injured at Pipeline. Pipeline has been called one of the world's deadliest waves. Its average wave is 9 feet (3 m), but it can be as tall as 20 feet. Especially perilous are sections of shallow reef known as \\"Off the Wall\\" and \\"Backdoor\\". A few of the notable surfers at Pipeline are Phil Edwards (surfer) (who is credited as the first person to surf it), Butch Van Artsdalen, Gerry Lopez, Mike Stewart, Shaun Tomson, Mark Richards, Wayne 'Rabbit' Bartholomew, Peter Townend, Michael Ho, Simon Anderson, Tom Carroll, Sunny Garcia, Kelly Slater, Danny Fuller, Jamie O'Brien, Rob Machado, Andy Irons, Mick Fanning, Gabriel Medina, John John Florence and Italo Ferreira.

It aired as a Disney Channel Original Movie, premiering on the Disney Channel on Friday, October 13, 2000. Plot 13-year-old Adam Hansen (Matt O'Leary) and his best friend Duffy (Jake Epstein) have some tickets for the Headless Horseman concert, and his sister 16-year-old Chelsea (Laura Vandervoort) has a date with her dreamy boyfriend Peter. The only problem is, they are both grounded: Adam is punished because he did not do his homework, instead making up a story using an article from the magazine The Weekly Secret, and Chelsea because she called Adam a dweeb, which their mother, Lynette (Caroline Rhea), happened to hear. Chelsea and Adam will do whatever it takes to get their mother out of the house, even if it includes a chance meeting with a very mysterious man named Dimitri (Charles Shaughnessy). Everything seems to go according to plan, until their 8-year-old little brother Taylor (Myles Jeffrey) realizes that Dimitri is a vampire. His brother and sister do not believe Taylor, so he calls Malachi Van Helsing (Robert Carradine), the vampire hunter. The night that their mother goes out with Dimitri, Taylor follows them. Not wanting their mother to come home and extend their punishments, they follow Taylor and find him outside the restaurant that Lynette and Dimitri are at. Adam and Taylor make the vampire do the spoon test (a fake test made up by Adam to get Taylor to stop calling Dimitri a vampire). Afterwards, Adam discovers that Taylor's hunch about Dimitri was right when he looks in the mirror and notices Dimitri does not have a reflection. So, along with Chelsea, he sets out to stop Dimitri, who puts their mother in a trance and plans to take her to his mansion. Meanwhile, Malachi Van Helsing arrives and begins to hunt down Dimitri, only to discover that he was being followed by Taylor, who (after learning the spoon test was made up by Adam) had also set out to save his mother from Dimitri. In the end, Taylor becomes Van Helsing's partner and they arrive to do battle with Dimitri, who has Lynette in a trance, but even together Taylor, Adam, Chelsea and Van Helsing are unable to defeat Dimitri. Dimitri goes to bite a powerless Adam, but he and Chelsea call out to Lynette, breaking her trance (as only true love for someone can break a vampire's trance). She throws Dimitri into his coffin. Van Helsing seals the coffin with silver-plated nails and explains that he plans to send it to a place where it's always sunny. Shortly after Dimitri is sealed up, Van Helsing asks their mother out on a \\"date\\", after which Adam, Chelsea and Taylor, believing they have heard the word \\"date\\" enough for one night, try to convince her to stay single which is when Lynette confesses, \\"I date. Just not vampires\\". Finally, they all decide to go back to the Hansen house for breakfast as the sun is finally rising.  Cast  * Caroline Rhea as Lynette Hansen. The strict no nonsense divorced mother of Chelsea, Adam, and Taylor. Lynette is overprotective of Taylor. * Matt O'Leary as Adam Hansen, the 13-year-old protagonist.

History Thuringian sausage has been produced for hundreds of years. The oldest known reference to a Thuringian sausage is located in the Thuringian State Archive in Rudolstadt in a transcript of a bill from an Arnstadt convent from the year 1404. The oldest known recipe dates from 1613 and is kept in the State Archive in Weimar, another is listed in the \\"Th√ºringisch-Erfurtische Kochbuch\\" from 1797 which also mentions a smoked variety. Production Only finely minced pork, beef, or sometimes veal, is used in production. Most of the meat comes from the upper part from around the shoulder. In addition to salt and pepper, caraway, marjoram, and garlic are used. The specific spice mixtures can vary according to traditional recipes or regional tastes. At least 51% of the ingredients must come from the state of Thuringia. These ingredients are blended together and filled into a pig or sheep intestine. Thuringian sausages are distinguished from the dozens of unique types of German wursts by the distinctive spices (which includes marjoram) and their low fat content (25% as compared to up to 60% in other sausages). According to German minced meat law, the Hackfleischverordnung, raw sausages must be sold on the day of their creation or until the closing of a late-night establishment. Previously grilled sausages have a shelf-life of 15 days, and sausages immediately frozen after their creation may be stored for 6 months. Preparation The preferred preparation method for Thuringian sausage is roasted over charcoal or on a grill rubbed with bacon. The fire shouldn't be so hot that the skin breaks. However, some charring is desired. The sausages are sometimes sprinkled with beer during the grilling process. Usually, a Thuringian sausage is presented in a cut-open roll and served with mustard.Most often Born Thuringian culture For the people of Thuringia, grilled Thuringian sausage is not merely the local cuisine. The grill is at the very core of Thuringian culture. Mostly beer instead of water is used to cool the grill, and the type of grill is a matter of doctrine. Mustard, preferably local, is the traditional condiment. Most commonly used is \\"Born mustard\\" from a local food company in Erfurt. In some regions the usage of any relish - even mustard - is a strict taboo. In eastern of Thuringia most commonly used is \\"Bautz‚Äôner\\" mustard. In 2006, the Deutsches Bratwurstmuseum, opened in Holzhausen, part of the Wachsenburggemeinde near Arnstadt, the first museum devoted exclusively to the Thuringian sausage. North America In North America, the term Thuringer refers to Thuringer cervelat, a type of smoked semi-dry sausage similar to summer sausage. It is made from a medium grind of beef, blended with salt, cure ingredients, spices (usually including dry mustard), and a lactic acid starter culture. After stuffing into a fibrous casing, it is smoked and dried, then cooked. Hormel Foods Corporation and Usinger's, as well as many regional processors and some small butcher shops, produce the sausage in this fashion Luxembourg Prior to Thuringian sausages acquiring PGI status in the EU, a type of Luxembourgish sausage was locally known as a Th√ºringer. It is now referred to as \\"L√´tzebuerger Grillwurscht\\" ().

He was the editor-in-chief of MacMillan's eight-volume Encyclopedia of Philosophy from 1967, and lectured at New York University, Brooklyn College and the New School for Social Research from the 1960s to the 1990s.Bayot, Jennifer. Edwards' obituary at wasm.us \\"Paul Edwards, Professor and Editor of Philosophy, dies at 81\\" , The New York Times, December 16, 2004. Life and career Edwards was born Paul Eisenstein in Vienna in 1923 to assimilated Jewish parents, the youngest of three brothers. According to Peter Singer, his upbringing was non-religious. He distinguished himself early on as a gifted student and was admitted to the Akademisches Gymnasium, a prestigious Viennese high school. When Germany annexed Austria in 1938, Edwards was sent by his family to Scotland, later joining them in Melbourne, Australia, where the family name was changed to Edwards. He attended Melbourne High School, graduating as dux of the school, then studied philosophy at the University of Melbourne, completing a B.A. and M.A.Singer, Peter. \\"Philosopher insisted on clarity and rigour,\\" The Age (Melbourne), January 14, 2005. He was awarded a scholarship to study in England in 1947, but on his way there, he stopped in New York and ended up staying there for the rest of his life, apart from a brief period teaching at the University of California in Berkeley. He was awarded his doctorate by Columbia University in 1951. While writing his doctoral thesis he contacted Bertrand Russell because he shared Russell's scepticism about religious belief. This led to a lasting friendship and a number of joint projects. Edwards collected Russell's writings on religion and published them in 1957, with an appendix on \\"the Bertrand Russell case,\\" under the title Why I am not a Christian. He taught at New York University until 1966, at Brooklyn College from then until 1986, and at the New School from the 1960s until 1999. Edwards was characterized by Michael Wreen as \\"mixed one part analytic philosopher to one part philosophe\\" with \\"a deep respect for science and common sense.\\" His considerable influence on moral philosophy came from two works he edited, a very widely used introductory anthology he co- edited with Arthur Pap, A Modern Introduction to Philosophy (1957, 1965, 1973) and the Encyclopedia of Philosophy (1967), an eight-volume \\"massive Enlightenment work with notable analytic sensibility.\\"Wreen, Michael. \\"Edwards, Paul,\\" in Ted Honderich (ed.). The Oxford Companion to Philosophy. Oxford University Press, 1955, p. 220. He was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto. Philosopher Timothy Madigan wrote in an obituary: \\"Those who knew Edwards will always remember his erudition and his wicked sense of humour. [ ... ] Given Paul's own biting wit, it's not surprising that he so admired Voltaire and Russell. [ ... ] Never one to hide his own unbelief, he often commented that his two main goals were to demolish the influence of Heidegger and keep alive the memory of Wilhelm Reich, the much-reviled psychoanalyst whose critiques of religion Edwards felt remained valid.\\"\\"Tim Madigan remembers Paul Edwards (1923‚Äì2004)\\" . In: The Bertrand Russell Society Quarterly, Issue Nr. 127, August 2005. Edwards was also sympathetic to the Danish philosopher S√∏ren Kierkegaard, although he detested Kierkegaardian existentialist admirers such as Heidegger and William Barrett for confusing and conflating Kierkegaardian terminology.Edwards, Paul. (1971). Kierkegaard and the 'Truth' of Christianity. Philosophy, 46, pp 89-108. doi:10.1017/S0031819100017150. Encyclopedia of Philosophy Edwards was editor-in-chief of Macmillan's Encyclopedia of Philosophy, published in 1967. With eight volumes and nearly 1,500 entries by over 500 contributors, it is one of the monumental works of twentieth century philosophy. Using his editorial prerogative, Edwards made sure that there were plentiful entries on atheism, materialism and related subjects (which is not surprising considering that such subjects would have been of interest to modern philosophers). He always remained \\"a fervent advocate of clarity and rigour in philosophical argument.\\" When, after four decades, the Encyclopedia was revised by other editors for a new edition, Edwards told Peter Singer that he was \\"distressed that the revisions had diluted the philosophical message and had been too gentle on a lot of postmodern thought.\\" Reincarnation Edwards was highly skeptical of claims regarding reincarnation.Cogan, Robert. (1998). Critical Thinking: Step by Step. University Press of America. pp. 202-203. \\"Edwards catalogs common sense objections which have been made against reincarnation. 1) How does a soul exist between bodies? 2) Tertullian's objection: If there is reincarnation, why are not babies born with the mental abilities of adults? 3) Reincarnation claims an infinite series of prior incarnations. Evolution teaches that there was a time when humans did not yet exist. So reincarnation is inconsistent with modern science. 4) If there is reincarnation, then what is happening when the population increases? 5) If there is reincarnation, then why do so few, if any people, remember past lives?... To answer these objections believers in reincarnation must accept additional assumptions... Acceptance of these silly assumptions, Edwards says, amounts to a crucifixion of one's intellect.\\" He was the author of the book Reincarnation: A Critical Examination (1996), which is notable for criticizing the cases collected by Ian Stevenson. The book has received positive reviews from academics.Dilley, Frank. B. (1997). Reincarnation: A Critical Examination by Paul Edwards. International Journal for Philosophy of Religion. Vol. 42, No. 1. pp. 61-63.Blackwell, Kenneth. (1998). Rationalism and Reincarnation [Review of Paul Edwards, Reincarnation]. Russell: The Journal of Bertrand Russell Studies 18: 187-188. \\"Why should Edwards spend time on such arguments when, to rationalists, they are patently absurd or without empirical foundation? Because there is widespread belief in them... The book is salutary in revealing the persistence of nonsense and the persisting need for education, logic and good sense.\\" Barry Beyerstein wrote that \\"Skeptics who follow my recommendation and read Reincarnation: A Critical Examination will derive much ammunition for arguing not only with reincarnationists but with 'near-death experience' aficionados and afterlife enthusiasts of other stripes as well.\\" Philosopher and parapsychologist Stephen E. Braude criticized the arguments presented in Edwards's book, saying, \\"Apparently Edwards did not realize that his condescending and allegedly hard-nosed attack on reincarnationists was as deeply (and inevitably) metaphysical as the view he opposed.\\" Wilhelm Reich Edwards said that when he arrived in New York in 1947 Wilhelm Reich was \\"the talk of the town\\" and that for years he and his friends regarded Reich as \\"something akin to a messiah\\": \\"There was ... a widespread feeling that Reich had an original and penetrating insight into the troubles of the human race.\\"Edwards, Paul. \\"The Greatness of Wilhelm Reich,\\" The Humanist, March/April 1974, reproduced in Charles A. Garfield (ed.). Rediscovery of the Body. A Psychosomatic View of Life and Death.Dell 1977, pp. 41-50. Twenty years later, as editor-in-chief of the Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Edwards wrote an article about Reich, comprising 11 pages as compared to the four devoted to Sigmund Freud. He pointed out what is of interest to philosophers in Reich: his views concerning the origin of religious and metaphysical needs, the relation between the individual and society and the possibility of social progress, and, above all, the implications of his psychiatry for certain aspects of the mind-body problem. An abridged version of the article appeared in the Encyclopedia of Unbelief (ed. Gordon Stein, 1985). Edwards omitted Reich's orgone therapy from the Encyclopedia article because, he said, \\"it is of no philosophical interest.\\" However, in a BBC interview he said somewhat more: \\"I concede that Reich had no real competence as a physicist... At the same time I am quite convinced that the orgone theory cannot be complete nonsense. For a number of years, largely out of curiosity, I sat in an orgone accumulator once a day.\\" Works =Books= * (1949). Bertrand Russell's Doubts About Induction * (1950).

Parish church The ancient parish church of St Albright, Stanway In the early Medieval period Stanway had two churches; All Saints' next to Stanway Hall, and St Albright's in Little Stanway on the London Road (now the B1408). All Saints' church, first recorded in about 1260, had fallen out of use during the 16th century,'Stanway: Churches', A History of the County of Essex: Volume 10: Lexden Hundred (2001), pp. 270-273.

In the early 18th century the church was said to be \\"utterly decayed\\" and remains a ruin. The current Church of England parish church is dedicated to Saint Albright, who is generally identified with Saint Ethelbert the King, a king of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of East Anglia, who was killed in 794 AD.Buckler, George (1856) Twenty-Two Of The Churches Of Essex: Architecturally Described And Illustrated, Bell and Daldy, London (p. 242) It was in existence in the late 11th century and was a parish church soon afterwards but was referred to as a chapel in later documents. The oldest parts of the present building date from the 12th century and incorporate Roman bricks in the heads of some of the windows. A new chancel was added in 1880 when the church was restored by George Gilbert Scott.

Because waiting time forms part of the costs of transportation, the Mohring effect implies increasing returns to scale for scheduled urban transport services. The effect was named for the University of Minnesota economist Herbert Mohring, who identified this property in a 1972 paper.Mohring, H.(1972). \\"Optimization and Scale Economies in Urban Bus Transportation,\\" American Economic Review, 591-604.  Example  For example, suppose that passengers arrive randomly at a bus stop over the course of an hour, while the bus arrives once per hour. The average waiting time is 30 minutes. If the number of passengers per hour increases sufficiently to justify two buses per hour, then the average waiting time falls to 15 minutes. The presence of additional users lowers the cost of existing passengers. This anti-congestion effect is opposite to the usual road congestion effect, where an increase in the number of the users decreases the speed and the quality of service of the other users.  Transit subsidies  The Mohring effect is often referenced in support of transit subsidies, on the grounds that subsidy is required to achieve marginal cost pricing when the Mohring effect is relevant.William Vickrey (1980). \\"Optimal transit subsidy policy,\\" Transportation, Vol. 9 No. 4, 389-409 The average cost of a passenger-journey includes the average waiting time, while the marginal cost includes only the average waiting time less the diminution in total waiting time caused by the increase in frequency. Average cost thus exceeds marginal cost, and subsidy that bridges the gap is said to improve welfare.

It was written and published between 1868 and 1869 by the Comte de Lautr√©amont, the nom de plume of the Uruguayan-born French writer Isidore Lucien Ducasse. The work concerns the misanthropic, misotheistic character of Maldoror, a figure of evil who has renounced conventional morality. Although obscure at the time of its initial publication, Maldoror was rediscovered and championed by the Surrealist artists during the early twentieth century. The work's transgressive, violent, and absurd themes are shared in common with much of Surrealism's output; in particular, Louis Aragon, Andr√© Breton, Salvador Dal√≠, Man Ray, and Philippe Soupault were influenced by the work. Maldoror was itself influenced by earlier gothic literature of the period, including Lord Byron's Manfred, and Charles Maturin's Melmoth the Wanderer.Knight, pp. 16-19. Synopsis and themes Maldoror is a modular work primarily divided into six parts, or cantos; these parts are further subdivided into a total of sixty chapters, or verses. Parts one through six consist of fourteen, sixteen, five, eight, seven and ten chapters, respectively. With some exceptions, most chapters consist of a single, lengthy paragraph. The text often employs very long, unconventional and confusing sentences which, together with the dearth of paragraph breaks, may suggest a stream of consciousness, or automatic writing. Over the course of the narrative, there is often a first-person narrator, although some areas of the work instead employ a third-person narrative. The book's central character is Maldoror, a figure of evil who is sometimes directly involved in a chapter's events, or else revealed to be watching at a distance. Depending on the context of narrative voice in a given place, the first-person narrator may be taken to be Maldoror himself, or sometimes not. The confusion between narrator and character may also suggest an unreliable narrator. Several of the parts begin with opening chapters in which the narrator directly addresses the reader, taunts the reader, or simply recounts the work thus far. For example, an early passage warns the reader not to continue: Apart from these opening segments, each chapter is typically an isolated, often surreal episode, which does not seem at first to be directly related to the surrounding material. For example, in one chapter, a funeral procession takes a boy to his grave and buries him, with the officiant condemning Maldoror; the following chapter instead presents a story of a sleeping man (seemingly Maldoror) who is repeatedly bitten by a tarantula which emerges from the corner of his room, every night. Another strange episode occurs in an early chapter: the narrator encounters a giant glow-worm which commands him to kill a woman, who symbolizes prostitution. In defiance, the narrator instead hurls a large stone onto the glow-worm, killing it: However, as the work progresses, certain common themes emerge among the episodes. In particular, there is constant imagery of many kinds of animals, sometimes employed in similes. For example, in one case, Maldoror copulates with a shark, each admiring the others' violent nature, while in another, the narrator has a pleasant dream that he is a hog. These animals are praised precisely for their inhumanity, which fits the work's misanthropic tone: Another recurring theme among certain of the chapters is an urban‚Äìrural dichotomy. Some episodes take place in a town or city, while others occur at a deserted shore, with only a few actors. The juxtaposition of urban city scenes and rural shoreline scenes may be inspired by Ducasse's time in Paris and Montevideo, respectively. Other pervasive themes include homosexuality, blasphemy and violent crime, often directed against children. Maldoror's sixth and final part instead employs a definite change in style, while retaining most of the themes already developed. The final part (specifically its last eight chapters), intended as a \\"little novel\\" which parodies the forms of the nineteenth-century novel,Knight, pp. 21-26. presents a linear story using simpler language. In it, a schoolboy named Mervyn returns home to his well-to-do family in Paris, unaware that Maldoror had been stalking him. Maldoror writes Mervyn a love letter, requesting to meet, and Mervyn replies and accepts. Upon their meeting, Maldoror forces Mervyn into a sack, and beats his body against the side of a bridge, ultimately flinging the sack onto the dome of the Panth√©on. This final, violent episode has been interpreted as a killing of the traditional novel form, in favor of Maldorors experimental writing.Knight, p. 21. Influence Les Chants de Maldoror is considered to have been a major influence upon French Symbolism, Dada and Surrealism; editions of the book have been illustrated by Odilon Redon, Salvador Dal√≠ and Ren√© Magritte.Les Chants de Maldoror. With 77 illustrations by Ren√© Magritte; √âditions De \\"La Bo√©tie‚Äú, Brussels 1948. Italian painter Amedeo Modigliani was known to keep a copy of Maldoror available while traveling in the Montparnasse, sometimes quoting from it. Outsider artist Unica Z√ºrn's literary work The Man of Jasmine was influenced by Maldoror; likewise, William T. Vollmann was influenced by the work. Maldoror was followed by Po√©sies, Ducasse's other, minor surviving work, a short work of literary criticism, or poetics. In contrast to Maldoror, Po√©sies has a far more positive and humanistic tone, and so may be interpreted as a response to the former. For a more detailed treatment of Po√©sies, see the author's main article.

It opened its doors in 1996, as part of the multi-purpose Jean Augustine Complex, named for Jean Augustine, the first African Canadian woman elected to Parliament and appointed to the federal cabinet. The complex contains the high school, Rosemount Community Centre, and the City Playhouse Theatre, to which the school is given limited access. The school is part of the York Region District School Board. Westmount is one of the 29 secondary schools in the board which comprises 191 schools altogether. York Region District School Board Westmount is known for its arts program and its strong academic program. Many awards have been given to recognize the art, drama, dance, and music program known as ArtsWest. Mathematics and the sciences were also recognized with York Regional awards. The school is three levels with the first floor hosting many Arts, tech classes and the gymnasium, the second floor is prevalent in languages, and the third floor has many computer based classes, mathematics, business, and sciences. Jean Augustine Complex =Rosemount Community Centre= The community centre, which is attached to the northern edge of the school, contains an arena, a split gymnasium, and recreational rooms used for different events and programs, such as playing bridge. Rosemount also hosts various summer camps and programs, such as summer stock. The name of the community centre was created by merging the names of two nearby elementary schools and subdivisions, Rosedale and Westmount. The school is given access to the gym and arena throughout the years, such as for the school's hockey team. =City Playhouse= Adjoining Westmount from the southern portion of the complex, the City Playhouse is a 386-seat, community-based theatre featuring a wide variety of professional, community and school productions. It also serves the community as a rental house, particularly during the offseason months of May‚ÄìSeptember. The box office is on the south side of the theatre adjacent to New Westminster Drive. Similar to the community centre, the high school is given access to the theatre for use in assemblies, Westmount drama productions as well as other theatrical shows and the bi-annual musical productions, Springfest and Winterfest. Known productions to frequent the theatre include but are not limited to City Youth Players, Starbeat, Characters, Judy & David, and even the in-house City Playhouse Productions. Marquee Productions was also a major company to produce shows for the theatre, among others in the Greater Toronto Area, but are no longer producing for the City Playhouse theatre having finished their last projects there in April 2012. =Nursery= Attached to the west side of the complex, the Butternut Child Centre is a preschool which exists for children aged four and younger. There has been a mutual relationship between this nursery's daily functions and Westmount's student body, such as the observation of daycare kids by students taking Human Growth and Development and likewise, the kids being walked around the school during operating hours. Building The complex was built by MCW Consultants in 1995,http://www.mcw.com/display_pdf.asp?id=80 who later built a similar complex in Newmarket, Ontario, Newmarket High School. It too contains a similar attached community theatre. The older Milliken Mills High School in Markham, Ontario, built in 1988, has a similar layout on the inside to the two; however, it contains a very different fa√ßade and d√©cor. All three schools contain a large open atrium with a grand staircase that handles the highest volume of students getting to and from class. Even though these schools are in three different cities, they are all part of the York Region District School Board. Arts West In 2009, Westmount started to offer an arts program called ArtsWest, where the applicant can either major in Music (Instrumental), Dance, Visual Arts, Vocals, or Drama in the following school year. ArtsWest is the fourth Arts program within York Region. Alumni Westmount has seen over 3,000 graduates since its founding. Notable alumni include Shane Feldman and Sam Schachter.

He wrote plays, poetry, and stories depicting rural life in his native Gudbrandsdal, Norway.Bridgwater, W. & Beatrice Aldrich. (1966) The Columbia- Viking Desk Encyclopedia. Columbia University. p. 11.  Life  Aanrud, who came from a rural family, was born and raised in Auggedalen, a valley in Gausdal (part of Gudbrandsdal). He attended a grammar school and then practised as a private tutor. When he had some success with his literary works he moved to Oslo. There he was a literary and theatre critic. From 1911 to 1923 he was also an adviser at the national theatre of Oslo.Aanrud, Hans. In: Gero von Wilpert (ed.), Lexikon der Weltliteratur (Dictionary of World Literature). Third edition 1988, p. 1.  Works  The Chambers Biographical Dictionary says \\"His delightful children's books... deserve their place among the classics\\".Chambers Biographical Dictionary, , page 1 Aanrud gained fame by his realistic and folksy descriptions of the rural life of his home valley before the industrial age. The way of thinking of the ordinary peasants is presented in partly dialect dialogues and in their simple and friendly mode of expression. The landscape is atmospherically described and most parts of the stories are humorous; there are only sometimes also tragic features. The characters, plot and description of the landscape always form an integrated whole. Often children are the protagonists of Aanruds stories which therefore became popular children‚Äôs books. But Aanrud himself had intended his tales for older readers. These tales were soon translated and found wide distribution especially in the rest of Scandinavia, Great Britain and Germany. One of the most successful tales by Aanrud is his depiction of Sidsel Sids√¶rk (1903), a young Norwegian shepherdess who receives her epithet long skirt because of her much too long skirt, a Christmas present of her brother. The tale of the young shepherd S√∂lve Solfeng (1910), who lives in a valley in Norway, was also widespread. The content of both stories concerns the difficult conditions of the work of the country children who had to eke out a poor existence far away from their parents. In spite of this account of their hard lot an optimistic kind of portrayal is predominant. Two translations of shorter stories by Aanrud also achieved great fame in Germany: the tale collections Kroppzeug (1907) and Jungen (1910). The lower middle-class life in the city was also examined by Aanrud in some comedies in a satiric way, but these comedies were mainly known only in the Norwegian capital and are today nearly forgotten. In the comedy Storken (= stork, 1895), that is playing in Kristiania (the former name of Oslo) at the end of the 19th century, a na√Øve clerk tries to establish contacts to the high society but he is often deceived by a royal authorized representative, who takes advantage of his ignorance. Only at the end the clerk finds out the truth. In this comedy Aanrud mocks at affected and mendacious behaviour. He wanted a positive influence of the healthy rural world on the city life that he regarded as degenerate and rootless; in the end he wanted the rapprochement of the rural and the urban culture.Aanrud, Hans: In: Kindlers Neues Literatur-Lexikon (Kindler‚Äôs new literary dictionary), vol.1, Munich 1988, p. 7-8 Aanrud's works include: * Storken, 1895 * En Vinternat og andre Fort√¶llinger, 1896 * Hanen, 1898 * Sidsel Sids√¶rk (translated into English as Lisbeth Longfrock), 1903 * S√∏lve Solfeng, 1910 * Fort√¶llinger for Barn, 1917 * S√∏lve Suntrap, 1926 * Collected works, 6 volumes, 1914-1915; 3 volumes, 1943 References External links  * Category:1863 births Category:1953 deaths Category:People from Gausdal Category:Norwegian male poets Category:Norwegian theatre directors Category:19th-century Norwegian poets Category:20th-century Norwegian poets Category:Norwegian male short story writers Category:Norwegian dramatists and playwrights Category:19th-century Norwegian male writers Category:20th-century Norwegian male writers ","title":"Hans Aanrud"},{"id":"2159419","text":"Birmingham Moor Street is one of three main railway stations in the city centre of Birmingham, England, along with Birmingham New Street and Birmingham Snow Hill. Today's Moor Street station is a combination of the original station, opened in 1909 by the Great Western Railway as a terminus for local trains, and a newer Moor Street station with through platforms, a short distance from the original, which opened in 1987, replacing the original. The two were combined into one station in 2002, when the original was reopened and restored, and the newer station rebuilt in matching style. Moor Street has become more important in recent years; two of the original terminus platforms were reopened in 2010, and the station is now the terminus of many Chiltern Railways services from London Marylebone, as well as being an important stop for local services on the Snow Hill Lines. It is now the second busiest railway station in Birmingham. History =Earlier history (1909-1987)= At the turn of the 20th Century, suburban rail traffic into Birmingham was growing rapidly. The Great Western Railway greatly expanded their facilities in the city at that time to cope with the demands. Snow Hill station, their main station in Birmingham, was extensively rebuilt and expanded. However, the twin tracked Snow Hill tunnel, which ran underneath the city centre into Snow Hill from the south, did not have enough capacity to accommodate all of the traffic, and widening the tunnel was considered impractical. In order to solve the capacity problem therefore, Moor Street station was built at the opposite end of the tunnel to take terminating local trains from the south and relieve traffic. Moor Street station in 1915, from end of the platform, looking back towards the city centre, with the goods shed to the left. A local train waits at the terminus platforms in 1975. It was a terminus for local trains from , and local trains from via the recently opened North Warwickshire Line. It was opened with temporary buildings in July 1909, and the permanent buildings were completed in 1914. The station was located south of the entrance to Snow Hill tunnel, at the end of a short branch (the Moor Street branch) which connected the station to the main line. It originally had a single 700 ft (213 metre) long island platform with two platform faces. A third side platform, 600 ft (183 metres) long was added in 1930. The through tracks to Snow Hill running alongside, however, were not provided with platforms. Because the station was built on a confined site, it was equipped with two electrically operated traversers at the buffer end of the platforms as a space saving measure, in order to allow locomotives to move sideways between tracks, instead of having to reverse through crossovers. The traversers were removed from service in 1967, when all services to the station switched to diesel multiple unit operation. Trains only used Moor Street during Mondays to Saturdays, on Sundays, Snow Hill station was quiet enough to allow the train to terminate there instead. In 1948, upon nationalisation, Moor Street came under the control of the Western Region of British Railways, transferring to the London Midland Region, in 1963. Snow Hill station was run down during the late 1960s, and on 4 March 1968 the line between the junction with the Moor Street branch and Birmingham Snow Hill, including Snow Hill tunnel closed, leaving Moor Street as an isolated terminus for local trains. Moor Street itself came under threat of closure in 1969, however five local authorities objected and took the case to the High Court, which sided with the local authorities, preventing closure. From 1967 until the mid-1970s, Moor Street was at its lowest ebb; the infrequent local trains used Moor Street during peak hours only, at other times they ran to and from New Street. In the 1970s, local services from the station came under the control of the West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive (WMPTE) under whose auspices service frequencies were improved. From 1975, a regular interval half hourly service was introduced between Moor Street and and . Goods station Part of a 1922 GWR signalling diagram. The through line from Snow Hill (to the left) is at the top, the goods station at the bottom, and the passenger platforms in the middle. Moor Street was originally provided with a large goods station situated adjacent to the passenger station, which opened in 1914. It was built using the increasingly rare Hennebique technique for reinforced concrete. This took many goods trains which would otherwise have passed through Snow Hill tunnel. Because it was built in a confined space on a steep gradient, the goods station was built on two levels, with one high level, and two low level sheds. Three wagon lifts were provided to transfer wagons to and from the low level sheds. The low level sheds were equipped with electric traversers to move wagons between the lifts and sidings where they would be loaded and unloaded. A major source of traffic at the goods station was fresh fruit and vegetables, which would arrive at the station in the mornings, and be taken straight to the nearby market in the Bull Ring. The goods station was finally closed on 6 November 1972, and the main high-level shed was demolished three years later. The site of the former goods station is now partly occupied by the Selfridges Building, and some of the former low-level goods sheds are now used as a car-park. The two through platforms 1 & 2, looking towards Snow Hill tunnel. These were opened in 1987, but were given a makeover in the 2000s to match the style of the original station =Relocation= In the mid-1980s funding became available to reopen a station at Birmingham Snow Hill, along with Snow Hill tunnel. As part of the reopening scheme, a new Moor Street station with through platforms was built at the southern portal of the restored tunnel. On completion of this project, the original Moor Street terminus became redundant, and closed down. The final train, on 26 September 1987, was a steam special hauled by a locomotive from Birmingham Railway Museum, Clun Castle. The old platforms were disconnected from the network, and the new through station came into use on 5 October 1987. In the 1990s the range of services stopping at Moor Street were expanded for the first time since it opened. In 1993, limited stop Network SouthEast services were introduced from London Marylebone to Snow Hill via Banbury and Leamington Spa, stopping at Moor Street, thus making Moor Street a main line station for the first time. This service was taken over by Chiltern Railways following privatisation. In 1995, the completion of the \\"Jewellery Line\\" project north of Snow Hill, meant that through services to Worcester via and Kidderminster were introduced. =Restoration= The original station was not demolished but was mothballed and allowed to deteriorate. By the late 1990s, the former platforms were overgrown and dilapidated, and cracks in the wall were visible from the road side, including some caused by the impact of a runaway bus. In March 1988 the \\"Moor Street Station Historical Society\\" was formed to \\"Save Our Station\\". Dr Bernard Juby, a medical practitioner from nearby Yardley, became its Chairman and immediately set about campaigning for the station and its warehousing to be listed. Large teams of volunteers met each week-end to clean and preserve the various buildings. The existing artifacts were carefully renovated and stored and were subsequently re-used when the station reopened to the public. As a result of their efforts the old station became Grade II listed in 1998. The inspector from English Heritage visited the site in 1988 and agreed that both station and warehouses should be Listed, but it took a further 10 years and (with the help of Councillors Sir Stan Yapp and Fred Chapman) a 14,500+ signature petition to the City Council before the Secretary of State signed it off.Minutes of The Moor Street Station Historical Society. Archives, Central Library The station entrance concourse as redeveloped in 2010 A Chiltern Railway stands in the newly reopened terminus platform 3 In the 2000s, the growth in services on the Snow Hill Lines again strained capacity through Snow Hill tunnel, and so Chiltern Railways and the Birmingham Alliance decided to restore the original terminus and reopen it, to allow some services to terminate there rather than Snow Hill. Between 2002 and 2003 the original Moor Street station building and platforms were renovated and restored to a 1930s style at a cost of ¬£11 million. However, there was a long delay before the old terminal platforms were connected to the network and opened for service, because of delays in carrying out the necessary signalling work by Network Rail. Two of the three former terminal platforms, numbered 3 and 4, were reopened for use on 11 December 2010. The third bay platform 5 remains disused. The restoration project also unified the original station and the 1980s station into one. The main 1980s station entrance was demolished, and a new passenger access was created to the through platforms using the old station's ticket hall. The footbridge and canopies on the through platforms were also rebuilt to match the style of the original station. Station frontage with gilt signage, and canopy, added during restoration Refurbished in 1930s style, the station has reproduction lamps, clock, seating, and signage. The renovation won the Railway Heritage Trust award for 2004 and The Birmingham Civic Society's Renaissance Award for 2005. The station became home to the cosmetically restored second GWR 2884 Class 2-8-0 No. 2885, which, until being removed on 4 June 2013, stood in the disused platform five. Further renovations during 2011‚Äì12 included the installation of GWR-inspired gilt signage on the front and side elevations of the station building. Since the December 2010 timetable change, two of the three south facing bay platforms at Moor Street station are now connected to the network and in use, enabling some of the Chiltern services to and from London Marylebone to terminate at Moor Street instead of Snow Hill. Local Chiltern stopping services to Leamington Spa will also begin and terminate at the new terminal platforms. Chiltern Railways are engaged in a large-scale redevelopment of their route from London Marylebone to Birmingham with improvements to allow higher speeds. A fast train service between Moor Street and London Marylebone was introduced on 5 September 2011 using locomotive-hauled coaches, furthering the competition with Virgin Trains' West Coast Main Line services from Birmingham New Street.  Services  Moor Street is currently served by West Midlands Railway who run local services on the Snow Hill Lines, and by Chiltern Railways who run longer distance services to London Marylebone via the Chiltern Main Line: =Chiltern Railways= Some of the Chiltern London services terminate at Snow Hill, calling at Moor Street's through platforms, while other services terminate at Moor Street's terminal platforms. Some of the through Chiltern services continue beyond Birmingham to during peak hours. The Chiltern service is: * 2 trains per hour (tph) to London Marylebone via , , and . *A two-hourly stopping service to Leamington Spa =West Midlands Railway= Six West Midlands Railway trains per hour call at Moor Street in each direction, running as follows: Eastbound: * 3 trains per hour to : :of which one continues to * 3 trains per hour to :of which one continues to ::in peak hours some West Midlands Railway services continue from Dorridge to Leamington Spa. Westbound: * 6 trains per hour to : :of which four continue to : ::of which two continue to :::(services beyond Worcester, to Malvern and Hereford are irregular, generally about one per hour) On summer Sundays, Moor Street is used by steam locomotives running tourist specials between Snow Hill and Stratford upon Avon and trains between Snow Hill and Tyseley run by Vintage Trains. Links to New Street station Night-time aerial view, showing Moor Street (bottom left) and New Street (centre-right) stations, separated by the BullRing shopping centre Moor Street station is 400 yards (365 metres) away from New Street station; the city's main railway station. There is a signposted route for passengers travelling between New Street and Moor Street stations which involves a short walk through a tunnel under the Bullring shopping centre. Although the railway lines into New Street pass directly underneath Moor Street station, there is no track connection. In 2013 a new direct walkway was opened between the two stations making interchange easier. Proposed future developments The disused bay platform 5 at Moor Street, if the Camp Hill Chords go ahead, this will be reopened, along with a new platform 6 alongside it. Plans are being pursued to introduce new services into Moor Street by constructing new chords linking the station to the Camp Hill Line, which is currently mostly used by freight trains. The new chords would run into Moor Street's terminus platforms, and would allow a new local passenger service south to and beyond, including new stations at Moseley, Kings Heath and Hazelwell. This would also allow for new local services into Moor Street on the lines from Birmingham to and including a new station at . The currently disused third bay platform would be reopened, and an additional new fourth bay platform would be opened to accommodate the new services. In a West Midlands & Chiltern Routes Study it is proposed that services to the South West (via Worcester) and the East Midlands (Nottingham and Leicester) will be rerouted into Moor Street from New Street after the construction of the Camp Hill Chords. Network Rail have predicted that the number of passengers using Moor Street will grow to 8.9 million per year by 2023 and then to over 12 million by 2043. The High Speed 2's Birmingham city centre terminus, Birmingham Curzon Street railway station is planned to be built adjacent to Moor Street station. In March 2019, plans were revealed to redevelop Moor Street station which include a new footbridge to link all 6 platforms with the planned HS2 station and two new platforms (5 and 6), this is to get ready for re-routing of services from East Midlands, South West, Worcester and Hereford to Moor Street. On the 26 June 2019, plans were submitted to the Department for Transport to get funding for the ¬£2 billion investment programme known as the Midlands Rail Hub.More trains an hour through Birmingham Moor Street as part of ¬£2 billion Midlands rail upgrade plans birminghamupdates.com;26 June 2019 p.14 Plans for Moor Street included: * two new platforms (5 and 6) * two extra trains per hour to and * two extra commuter services per hour from via the Camp Hill Line * one extra train per hour to * one extra train per hour to via Worcester * one extra train per hour to * one extra train per hour to  See also  * Transport in Birmingham * Transport for West Midlands * Birmingham Snow Hill railway station * Birmingham New Street railway station * Chiltern Main Line * North Warwickshire Line  References   External links  *Birmingham Civic Society *Vintage Trains page * *Rail Around Birmingham and the West Midlands: Birmingham Moor Street railway station *Warwickshire Railways page *Moor Street station *Moor Street railway station layout Category:Grade II listed buildings in Birmingham Category:Grade II listed railway stations Category:Railway stations in Birmingham, West Midlands Category:Former Great Western Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1909 Category:Railway stations served by Chiltern Railways Category:Railway stations served by West Midlands Trains Category:Disused railway goods stations in Great Britain ","title":"Birmingham Moor Street railway station"},{"id":"2159420","text":"Fluxblog is an MP3 blog created and updated by Matthew Perpetua, music editor of BuzzFeed and contributing writer to Pitchfork, Slate, Vulture, Rolling Stone and MTV, \\"Making the Band: Buzzfeed Hires a Music Editor\\" by Foster Kamer, Observer, 24 July 2012, retrieved 9 October 2018.

The lake is one of only eight upland alkaline lakes in Europe. At an altitude of above sea level it is the highest marl lake in the United Kingdom. Its geology, flora and fauna have led to it being listed under a number of conservation designations. The site is currently owned by the National Trust, who lease part of the site to the Field Studies Council who offer residential and non-residential field courses there. The site was the inspiration for Charles Kingsley's 1863 novel The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby. Geography Malham Tarn is situated in the Yorkshire Dales, a national park in the Yorkshire Pennines. It lies approximately north-west of Bradford and about north of the nearest settlement, Malham. At above sea level it is sometimes, but erroneously, considered the highest lake in England, but there are lakes at higher altitudes such as Innominate Tarn. It is, however, the highest marl lake in Great Britain. The lake is one of only eight upland alkaline lakes in Europe, having a pH between 8.0 and 8.6. The catchment area of the lake is and the main inflow is a stream at the lake's north-west corner. The lake is at its deepest, with an average depth of and the surface area is . It takes approximately 11 weeks for water to leave the lake after it has entered. The primary outflow is a small stream at the southern end of the lake. The outflow stream goes underground after approximately before emerging downstream of Malham Cove as a source of the River Aire. Natural history The position of Malham Tarn in the southern Yorkshire DalesSituated in a limestone area, Malham Tarn itself mainly lies on a bed of silurian slate which is covered with marl deposits. The lake's basin was dammed by a moraine at the end of the last glacial period, approximately years ago. It used to be about twice its current size, having shrunk due to silting at the western shore; this has formed a boggy region called Tarn Moss. Following deforestation during the Iron Age, the land surrounding the lake has been used for grazing which has prevented further tree growth. An embankment and sluice gate were added to the lake in 1791 by Lord Ribblesdale; this has had the effect of raising the level of the lake by approximately . The average annual rainfall over the catchment area is . The lake is home to six species of fish, as well as white-clawed crayfish, great crested grebes, moorhens, coots, tufted ducks and teal. A number of waders such as redshanks, curlews, lapwings and oystercatchers breed in the surrounding area. Two rare benthic copepods, Bryocamptus rhaeticus and Moraria mrazeki, are found in the lake, along with 22 species of molluscs‚Äînine of which are found at their highest altitude in Britain. The lake also contains a number of submerged aquatic plants, while the surrounding area is home to a diverse number of plants including wild cranberry, bearberry, crowberry, dark-leaved willow and purple moor grass. Last seen fifty years ago, captive-bred water voles (Arvicola amphibius) were reintroduced in August 2016. This is the highest reintroduction of water vole in the UK. The lake is located in the Malham and Arncliffe Site of Special Scientific Interest which was established in 1955. In 1992, the lake and its wetlands were designated as a National Nature Reserve. The lake was listed as a Ramsar Convention site in 1993. It is also in the Craven Limestone Complex Special Area of Conservation. History There has been human activity at Malham Tarn dating back to the Mesolithic era when the shores of the lake were used for camping during hunting trips for deer and wild cattle. During the Bronze and Iron Ages, the surrounding area was settled by farmers who used the land for grazing. Following the Roman conquest of Britain the upland areas were not seen as attractive and the only Roman presence in the area was a marching camp on Malham Moor. During the Medieval period the lands were owned by the Monasteries, and their use for grazing continued. A survey undertaken in 1539 at the time of the dissolution of Fountains Abbey makes note of a farmstead on the northern shore of lake. Malham Tarn House now known as Malham Tarn Field Studies CentreFollowing the dissolution of the monasteries, the estates of Malham Moor then changed hands several times until they were eventually acquired by Thomas Lister‚Äîlater to become the first Lord Ribblesdale‚Äîin the mid- to late-18th century. Lister then built a hunting lodge on the site of the old farm in the 1780s. The estate was then sold to businessman James Morrison in 1852. Following Morrison's death the estates were inherited by his son, Walter, in 1857. While visiting Walter Morrison in 1858, author Charles Kingsley was inspired to write the Victorian era novel The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby. Walter Morrison died in 1921 and the estate subsequently changed hands a number times before being broken up. The house and the lake were eventually bought by Walter Morrison's great- niece, Mrs Hutton-Croft, in 1928. In 1946 Mrs Hutton-Croft presented the house to the National Trust, who manage the property and lease the house to the Field Studies Council, now called the Malham Tarn Field Studies Centre. The house exterior and the surrounding countryside can be seen in the 1951 film Another Man's Poison.

His best known work, De Actibus Apostolorum, is a verse history of the Apostles. Biography Arator was probably of Ligurian origin. An orphan, he studied at Milan under the patronage of the Bishop Laurentius and of Magnus Felix Ennodius, then went to Ravenna by the advice of Parthenius, nephew of Ennodius. He took up the career of a lawyer. This cites: *Leimbach, \\"Der Dichter Arator,\\" in Theologische Studien und Kritik (1873) *Manitius, Geschichte der christlich-lateinischen Poesie (1891). Treated with distinction by Theodoric on account of his oration in behalf of the Dalmatians, and protected by Cassiodorus, he entered the service of the Gothic court, but resigned at the time of the struggle with Byzantium (about 536). Pope Vigilius made him Subdeacon of the Roman Church. It was there that he wrote in hexameters two books De Actibus Apostolorum, about 544. He follows the story of the Acts of the Apostles; the first book, dedicated to St. Peter, concludes with Chapter XII; the second, dedicated to St. Paul, with the martyrdom of the two Apostles. Many important events are omitted, others only alluded to. Arator himself declared that his aim was to give the mystical and moral meaning of the book. Accordingly, he often gives strange interpretations of numbers and names. He endeavours to praise St. Peter at the expense of St. Paul and the other Apostles. His style and versification are fairly correct, and he cleverly evades the entanglements of symbolism. The poem was very successful. Vigilius had the author read it in public at the church of San Pietro in Vincoli in Rome. The reading lasted four days, as the poet had to repeat many passages by request of his audience. His works remained popular during the Middle Ages, when they became classics. We have also two addresses in distichs written by Arator to the Abbot Florianus and to Vigilius, as well as a letter to Parthenius. The latter two pieces contain biographical details. The date of the poet's death is unknown. References Sources Tino Licht: Aratoris fortuna, in: Quaerite faciem eius semper, Hamburg 2008, S. 163-179. * see also Roger P. H.

Life Alexander Ramsay (abt 1290-1342) was the eldest of two sons born to Sir William Ramsay of Dalhousie( abt 1235-1320), the other being Sir William Ramsay of Inverleith. =Military career= Sir Alexander became Warden of the Middle Marches in command of Lothian men, and one of the Regent's chief commanders at Boroughmuir, where Guy de Namur, a Flemish ally of England, was defeated. He was present at the capture of Leuchars Castle, at St Andrews in 1335, and in June 1338 he relieved Dunbar Castle and assisted the Countess of Dunbar in her struggle to maintain the stronghold against the English. His tragic story begins when he and his party of men recaptured Roxburgh Castle from the English in 1342. The titular constable of the Castle, Sir William Douglas, had several times tried unsuccessfully to retake it. For his brave and heroic feat, Sir Alexander was appointed constable of Roxburgh and Sheriff of Teviotdale. Sir William Douglas was so outraged by the appointments, that he sought revenge by capturing Sir Alexander and imprisoning him in the dungeon of Hermitage Castle where he was left to starve. Legend has it that he survived for seventeen days by eating small quantities of grain that fell through the cracks in the floor of the castle granary above the dungeon.

Samuel L. Jackson served as a producer, and starred in the film with Lisa Nicole Carson, Jurnee Smollett, Lynn Whitfield, Debbi Morgan, Meagan Good and Diahann Carroll. In 2018, it was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry for being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\\" Plot Eve Batiste (Jurnee Smollett), a 10-year-old girl, lives in a prosperous Creole-American community in Louisiana with her younger brother Poe (Jake Smollett) and her older sister Cisely (Meagan Good) in the 1960s. Their parents are Roz (Lynn Whitfield) and Louis (Samuel L. Jackson), a well-respected doctor in Louisiana's \\"colored\\" community who claims descent from the French aristocrat who founded the town of Eve's Bayou. One night after a raucous party, Eve accidentally witnesses her father having sex with Matty Mereaux (Lisa Nicole Carson), a family friend. However, Cisely, who has a very affectionate relationship with her father, convinces Eve that she misinterpreted an innocent moment. The unreliability of memory and observation remain important themes throughout the film. The summer quickly becomes a chaotic and stressful one for the Batiste family. Eve's relationship with her parents becomes more strained as she discovers more evidence of her father's serial infidelity. Cisely comes into conflict with both her sister and mother as she enters puberty and tries to navigate the difficult transition to adulthood, particularly with regard to her appearance and sexuality. Roz eventually begins to suspect her husband's infidelity, prompting conflict between the two as well. During the chaotic summer, Eve often seeks refuge with her Aunt Mozelle (Debbi Morgan) who works as a \\"psychic counselor\\" and has had three husbands who all died violently; the most recent having died in a car crash. Eve, who has a premonitory dream shortly before the accident occurs, is told by Mozelle that the gift of second sight runs in their family. Mozelle's gift also brings her into direct conflict with Elzora (Diahann Carroll), a fortune teller and possible witch with similar abilities. When asked for a reading by Roz, Elzora implies that an unexpected \\"solution\\" to her problem will arise, but to wait and look to her children in the meantime. When Mozelle grudgingly makes a similar request, Elzora cruelly tells her that she is a \\"black widow,\\" whose future husbands will suffer the same fate as her previous ones. Meanwhile, Eve, frustrated by her father's infidelity, begins to act out, bringing her into conflict with the other members of her family. Cisely begins to behave strangely as well, isolating herself from the family after experiencing her first period. Cisely later confides in Eve the secret behind her strange mood. She tells her that one night, after their parents had a vicious argument, Cisely went to comfort her father and he, while drunk, attempted to molest her. Enraged, Eve seeks out Elzora to commission a voodoo spell to put a fatal curse on her father. While on her way to visit the witch, Eve runs into Lenny Mereaux (Roger Guenveur Smith) and questions him about his teaching job that keeps him away from home. In the conversation, she alludes to a possible tryst between his wife, Matty, and her father. Eve is under the impression that she is going to receive a voodoo doll of her father. When returning to the witch to get her doll, she is informed that there is no doll and that, per her request, a curse has been placed on her father. In an attempt to save him, Eve rushes to bring her father home, finding him in a bar chatting with Matty Mereaux. At the same time, a drunken Lenny arrives to take Matty home. After a confrontation, Lenny and Matty leave the bar, and Lenny tells Louis that he will kill him if he talks to Matty again. After Louis says goodbye to Matty, Lenny shoots and kills Louis. After her father's funeral, Eve soon finds a letter which her father wrote to Mozelle, disputing the accusations. In it, he claims that Cisely had come to him that night and kissed him, first as a daughter and then as a lover. In his drunken state, he reacted violently, slapping her and pushing her to the ground, which made her angry with him. Eve confronts Cisely and uses her second sight to discover what really happened. It ends with the sisters holding hands, gazing at the sunset. Cast * Jurnee Smollett as Eve Batiste * Debbi Morgan as Mozelle Batiste Delacroix * Samuel L.

Most versions released in the 20th century were published by GameTek, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1998. Console games An Atari 2600 adaptation of Wheel of Fortune was planned by The Great Game Co. in 1983, but ended up being cancelled during development. In 1987 the first of GameTek's many Wheel games was published, with Sharedata as its developer; this version was released simultaneously on the Commodore 64 and the Nintendo Entertainment System, and subsequently spawned a second Commodore 64 version of Wheel from Sharedata, as well as a \\"Family Edition\\" and a \\"Junior Edition\\", both of which were exclusive to the NES and were developed by Rare Neither host Pat Sajak nor hostess Vanna White is featured in any of these games; however, White is featured in a later NES game from GameTek and IJE Inc., which was released in 1992 and also appeared on the Sega Genesis, Super NES, and the Game Gear. The magazine Mega gave the Super NES and Genesis versions a score of 22%, saying that there was \\"no challenge\\".Mega review, Future Publishing, issue 3, page 40, December 1992 A \\"Deluxe Edition\\" was also released for the Super NES in 1994. In 1994, Sony Imagesoft released a game based on Wheel for the Sega CD. Next Generation rated it two stars out of five, and stated that \\"Even as a party game, Wheel of Fortune doesn't cut it.\\" Two years later, GameTek made plans to create adaptations for the Sega Saturn and the 3DO, but both were canceled during development. In mid-1997, Take-Two Interactive acquired GameTek's assets, including the rights to develop Wheel of Fortune games for the Nintendo 64. On December 2, 1997, Take-Two Interactive released its first Wheel game for the Nintendo 64; this was Take-Two's last collaboration with GameTek. The Sega CD and N64 versions of Wheel both feature full-motion video footage of White as host. Reviews generally stated that the N64 version did not hold up well to other N64 games but did a decent job of recreating the show, particularly the camera movements and the 3D studio. However, they derided the unnatural- sounding voices of the contestants and the animations of Vanna White walking in front of the puzzles (without touching the panels when they light up). The game received a score of 6.4 out of 10 from IGN and 5.125 out of 10 from Electronic Gaming Monthly. Artech Studios and Hasbro Interactive produced a video game adaptation of Wheel for Sony Computer Entertainment's PlayStation console on December 15, 1998; this version again features White appearing as host via FMV sequences, and a 3-D engine that allows it to have a presentation similar to that of the actual show. This particular version is compatible with a memory card which allows it to avoid previously played puzzles until the entire library has been played through. On September 12, 2000, Hasbro released a second PlayStation version of Wheel, which features a behind-the-scenes interview with White and a qualifying exam for contestant hopefuls. After this, Atari, Inc. released a PlayStation 2 edition in November 2003. On March 19, 2009, Sony Online Entertainment released a version of the show for the PlayStation 3 through the PlayStation Network; Chris Roper of IGN gave that version a 5.8 out of 10, saying that it felt \\"empty and lifeless\\" for not featuring any host or hostess or any voice work whatsoever, and also criticized the graphic quality, saying that the game was \\"not fully polished\\". On November 2, 2010, THQ released video games based on Wheel of Fortune for Nintendo's Wii console. This set of games is the first to feature Sajak as well as White as well as the last to feature announcer Charlie O'Donnell. Another Wii game would be released 4 years later by Nordic Games. In 2012 THQ- published versions developed by Pipeworks Software appeared for the PlayStation 3, the Wii U, and Microsoft's Xbox 360. On November 7, 2017, Ubisoft released video games based on Wheel of Fortune for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The game comes in digital download as well as a bundle retail version with Jeopardy!. This version of Wheel of Fortune features Classic and Quick modes, as well as online multiplayer options like leaderboards and voice chat. It includes over 4,000 puzzles and a leveling system that enables players to unlock 250 new customization items that can be used on contestants or the studio set. This version was later released for Nintendo Switch. Handheld games In 1988, Mattel created a Wheel of Fortune game that allowed playing along with the TV show. At that time, the show would include encoded data at the beginning of each round, seen as flickering in the TV picture, that the Mattel machine could \\"download\\" to receive the puzzle and timing information for when letters were revealed in the puzzle. The game allowed players to spin and guess letters in the puzzle, buy vowels, and solve the puzzle. If a contestant on the TV show solved the puzzle before a person playing the Mattel machine solved it, the machine would reveal the puzzle and terminate the round. In 1990, GameTek created a Wheel of Fortune game for the Game Boy. Then in 1997, Tiger Electronics released two adaptations of the show for its Game.com system, which allows players to use the console's touchscreen to select letters. Additionally, Majesco Entertainment once planned a Wheel adaptation of its own for the Game Boy Color but that was cancelled. On November 2, 2010, THQ published a Nintendo DS Wheel of Fortune video game developed by Griptonite Games, which allows players to customize and name their player character. Additionally, a number of Wheel games have been released for mobile telephones. On May 2, 2005, InfoSpace's Atlas Mobile studio created a tournament-style game based on the show as part of its \\"For Prizes\\" lineup of games allowing players to win free gift certificates; this game is set to a time limit of five minutes and requires players to complete the regular rounds in five turns or less apiece. Subsequent mobile phone incarnations of the show were released by Sony Pictures Mobile in 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012. PC games Wheel of Fortune has also been adapted for personal computers. From 1987 through 1990, GameTek created five Wheel of Fortune computer games for the Apple II, Commodore 64, and MS-DOS. On November 15, 1998, Hasbro Interactive released a PC version of its own, where Vanna White is joined by the then-current Wheel announcer, Charlie O'Donnell (but not Pat Sajak). In 2000 a port for Macintosh was made, released by MacSoft That same year, Hasbro released a second PC version of Wheel, which like the aforementioned PlayStation equivalent features a behind-the-scenes interview and a qualifying exam. Atari's 2003 follow-up also saw a PC version of its own. In 2007 Sony Online Entertainment produced a PC version of the show titled Wheel of Fortune Deluxe, sharing publishing duties with Encore, Inc. Encore followed that up with a \\"Super Deluxe\\" version of the game in 2008. Internet Sony Pictures Digital and Game Show Network's interactive division released a free Wheel of Fortune game on Facebook. It combined most aspects of the TV game show and allowed players to become contestants competing for virtual currency, called \\"Wheel Bucks,\\" by playing a \\"Main Round\\" puzzle on their own and a \\"Bonus Round\\" puzzle allowing them to collaborate with their Facebook friends to increase their winnings. The game was later moved to GSN's \\"Games by GSN Casino\\" with better graphics, faster load times, the ability to amass collections and win trophies, and a full- screen mode, but eventually the game was taken down. The \\"Games by GSN Casino\\" has also featured a \\"Wheel of Fortune Slots\\" game that abides by the basic rules of slots games but incorporates aspects of the actual show in various ways, such as featuring a bonus game where players can spin the Wheel to increase their earnings; this is the only one of Wheels many slots games not to be manufactured by International Game Technology. Neither game features Sajak nor White, and both games support only one player. Other games A Wheel of Fortune pinball machine was released in the fall of 2007 and was developed by Stern Pinball. It was designed by Kevin O'Connor and Margaret Hudson, and features the voices of Sajak and O'Donnell. Although White does appear with Sajak on the marquee, her voice is never heard in the game.

Within this physical description there are two distinct antenna types: The large self-resonant loop antenna has a circumference close to one wavelength of the operating frequency and so is resonant at that frequency. These antennas are used for both transmission and reception. Resonant loop antennas have a two-lobe radiation pattern; they are most sensitive to radio waves in two broad lobes in opposite directions, 180¬∞ apart. Small loop antennas have a small circumference compared to the operating wavelength. They may be used for transmission and reception, although antennas that are very small compared to the wavelength are very inefficient radiators, and so are only used for reception. An example is the ferrite (loopstick) antenna used in most AM broadcast radios. The radiation pattern of a small loop antenna has two sharp nulls in opposite directions. Due to this directional pattern, small loops are used for radio direction finding (RDF), to locate the position of a transmitter. Resonant loop antennas Resonant loop antennas are relatively large, governed by the intended wavelength of operation. They are mainly used at higher frequencies where their size is manageable. They can be viewed as a folded dipole split into an open shape. The loop's shape can be a circle, triangle, square, rectangle, or in fact any closed polygon; the only strict requirement is that its perimeter must be (slightly over) one full-wavelength. The radiation pattern of a resonant loop antenna peaks at right angles to the plane of the loop. At the lower shortwave frequencies a full loop is physically quite large, and can practically only be installed \\"lying flat\\", with the plane of the loop horizontal to the ground, consisting of wires supported at the same height by masts at its corners. This results in a radiation pattern peaking toward the vertical. Above 10 MHz, the loop is more frequently \\"standing up\\", that is with the plane of the loop vertical, in order to direct its main beam towards the horizon. It may be attached to an antenna rotator in order to rotate that direction as desired. Compared to a dipole or folded dipole, the large loop's radiation pattern is lower toward the sky or ground, giving it about 1.5 dB higher gain in the two favored horizontal directions. A quad antenna is a resonant loop in a square shape; this one also includes a parasitic element. Additional gain (and a uni-directional radiation pattern) is usually obtained with an array of such elements either as a driven endfire array or in a Yagi configuration (with all but one loop being parasitic elements). The latter is widely used in amateur radio in the \\"quad\\" configuration (see photo). Loop antennas may be in the shape of a circle, a square or any other closed geometric shape that allows the total perimeter to be one wavelength. The most popular shape in amateur radio is the quad antenna or \\"quad\\", a resonant loop in a square shape so that it can be constructed of wire strung across a supporting ‚ÄòX‚Äô frame. There may be one or more additional loops stacked parallel to the first as parasitic elements, making the antenna system unidirectional with increased gain. This design can also be turned 45 degrees to a diamond shape supported on a ‚Äò+‚Äô frame. Triangular loops have also been used. A rectangle twice as high as its width obtains slightly increased gain and also matches 50 ohms directly if used as a single element. The polarization of such an antenna is not obvious by looking at the loop itself, but depends on the feed point (where the transmission line is connected), and whether it is being operated as a 1, 2, or 3 wavelength loop. If a vertically oriented loop is fed at the bottom at its 1 wavelength frequency, it will be horizontally polarized; feeding it from the side will make it vertically polarized. In all of the large loops described above, the antenna's operating frequency is assumed to be at its first resonance, whose corresponding wavelength almost matches the circumference of the loop. Other loop antenna resonances exist near frequencies where the perimeter is 2 wavelengths, 3 wavelengths, etc., with very different radiation patterns. Low frequency one wavelength loops are sometimes used on higher frequencies where the circumference will be several whole wavelengths. Using the loop at overtone frequencies, the feedpoint impedance will also be very different, so operation will require use of an antenna tuner. Radiation patterns at higher resonances are very different: Most noticeably the maximum radiation is in the plane of the loop, like a small loop (see below), instead of being perpendicular to it. Small loops Small loops (or magnetic loops\\") are ‚Äúsmall‚Äù in comparison to their operating wavelength, typically between 5% and 30% of a wavelength in circumference. As with all antennas, antennas used much below resonance have a much smaller radiation resistance, increasing the relative importance of ohmic losses, resulting in a much poorer antenna efficiency. However, small loops may be resorted to at lower frequencies (wavelengths of tens to hundreds of meters) where resonant loops and half-wave dipole antennas become impractical. nulls off the sides, the small loop (right) has maximum signal in the plane of its wires with nulls broadside to the wires. Contrary to resonant loop antennas, the antenna pattern of small loops peaks in the plane of the loop rather than broadside to it. Small loops have advantages as receiving antennas at frequencies below 10 MHz. Although a small loop's losses can be high, the receiving signal-to-noise ratio may not suffer at these lower frequencies, where received noise is dominated by atmospheric noise and static rather than receiver noise. The ability to rotate a smaller antenna may help to maximize the signal and reject interference. =Small transmitting loops= Size, shape, efficiency, and pattern A loop antenna for amateur radio under construction Small transmitting loops are ‚Äúsmall‚Äù in comparison to a full-wave loop, but considerably larger than the small receiving loop, and unlike receiving loops must be ‚Äúscaled-up‚Äù for longer wavelengths. They are typically used on frequencies between 3-30 MHz. They usually consist of a single turn of large diameter conductor, and are typically round or octagonal to provide maximum enclosed area for a given perimeter. The smaller of these loops are much less efficient than full-sized self-resonant loops, but where space is at a premium the smaller loops can provide effective communications. Loop antennas are relatively easy to build. A small transmitting loop antenna, also known as a magnetic loop, with a circumference 10% of a wavelength or less, will have a relatively constant current distribution along the conductor, and the main lobe will be in the plane of the loop. Loops of any size between 10% and 100% of a wavelength in circumference can be built and tuned to resonance with series reactance. A capacitor is required for a circumference less than a half wave, an inductor for loops more than a half wave and less than a full wave. Loops in this size range may have neither the uniform current of the small loop, nor the double peaked current of the full sized loop and thus cannot be analyzed using the concepts developed for the small receiving loops nor the self resonant loop antennas. Performance is best determined with NEC analysis. Antennas within this size range include the halo (see below) and the G0CWT (Edginton) loop. All small transmitting loops work even better for receiving. Matching to the transmitter In addition to other common impedance matching techniques such as a gamma match, transmitting loops are sometimes impedance matched by connecting the feedline to a smaller feed loop inside the area surrounded by the main loop. Typical feed loops are to the size of the antenna's main loop. The combination is in effect a transformer, with power in the near-field inductively coupled from the feed loop to the main loop, which itself is connected to the resonating capacitor and is responsible for radiating most of the power. Use for land-mobile radio Small loops are used in land- mobile radio (mostly military) at frequencies between 3-7 MHz, because of their ability to direct energy upwards, unlike a conventional whip antenna. This enables Near Vertical Incidence Skywave (NVIS) communication up to 300 km in mountainous regions. In this case a typical radiation efficiency of around 1% is acceptable because signal paths can be established with 1 Watt of radiated power or less when a transmitter generating 100 Watts is used. In military use, the antenna may be built using a one or two conductors 1-2 inches in diameter. The loop itself is typically 6 feet in diameter. Power limits One practical issue with small loops as transmitting antennas is that the loop not only has a very large current going through it, but also has a very high voltage across the capacitor, typically thousands of Volts when fed with only a few Watts of transmitter power. This requires a rather expensive and physically large resonating capacitor with a large breakdown voltage, in addition to having minimal dielectric loss (normally requiring an air-gap capacitor). In addition to making the geometric loop larger, efficiency may be increased by using larger conductors or other measures to reduce the conductor's loss resistance. However, lower loss means higher Q and even greater voltage on the capacitor. This problem is more serious than with a vertical or dipole antenna that is short compared to a wavelength. There matching using a loading coil also generates a high voltage at the antenna end(s). However, unlike with capacitors, the voltage across a physically large inductor is generally not an issue. =Small receiving loops= Small loop antenna used for receiving, consisting of about 10 turns around a 12 cm √ó 10 cm rectangle.LF and MF wavelengths. If the perimeter of a loop antenna is much smaller than the wavelengths intended ‚Äì say to of a wavelength ‚Äì then the antenna is a small loop antenna. Several performance factors, including received power, scale in proportion to loop area. For a given loop area, the length of the conductor (and thus its net loss resistance) is minimized if the perimeter is circular, making a circle the optimal shape for small loops. Small receiving loops are typically used below 3 MHz where human-made and natural atmospheric noise dominate. Thus the signal-to-noise ratio of the received signal will not be adversely affected by low efficiency as long as the loop is not excessively small. A typical diameter of receiving loops with \\"air centers\\" is between 30 cm and 1 meter. To increase the magnetic field in the loop and thus its efficiency, while greatly reducing size, the coil of wire is often wound around a ferrite rod magnetic core; this is called a ferrite loop antenna. Such ferrite loop antennas are used in almost all AM broadcast receivers with the exception of car radios; the antenna is then usually contained inside the radio's chassis. These antennas are also used for radio direction finding. LF, MF, and HF spectrum according CCIR 322 The radiation resistance of a small loop is generally much smaller than the loss resistance due to the conductors composing the loop, leading to a poor antenna efficiency. Consequently, most of the power delivered to a small loop antenna will be converted to heat by the loss resistance, rather than doing useful work. So much wasted power is not acceptable in a transmitting antenna, however in a receiving antenna the inefficiency is not important at frequencies below about 15 MHz. At these lower frequencies, atmospheric noise (static) and man-made noise (radio frequency interference) even in the weak signal from an inefficient antenna are far above the internal thermal or Johnson noise present in the radio receiver's circuits, so the weak signal from a loop antenna can be amplified without degrading the signal-to-noise ratio.CCIR 258; CCIR 322. For example, at 1 MHz the man-made noise might be 55 dB above the thermal noise floor. If a small loop antenna's loss is 50 dB (as if the antenna included a 50 dB attenuator) the electrical inefficiency of that antenna will have little influence on the receiving system's signal-to- noise ratio. In contrast, at quieter frequencies at about 20 MHz and above, an antenna with a 50 dB loss could degrade the received signal-to-noise ratio by up to 50 dB, resulting in terrible performance. Magnetic vs. electrical antennas The small loop antenna is known as a magnetic loop since it behaves electrically as a coil (inductor). It couples to the magnetic field of the radio wave in the region near the antenna, in contrast to monopole and dipole antennas which couple to the electric field of the wave. In a receiving antenna (the main application of small loops) the oscillating magnetic field of the incoming radio wave induces a current in the wire winding by Faraday's law of induction. Radiation pattern and polarization Surprisingly, the radiation and receiving pattern of a small loop is quite opposite that of a large self resonant loop (whose circumference is close to one wavelength). Since the loop is much smaller than a wavelength, the current at any one moment is nearly constant round the circumference. By symmetry it can be seen that the voltages induced in the loop windings along the plane of the loop, will cancel each other when a perpendicular signal arrives on the loop axis. Therefore, there is a null in that direction. Instead, the radiation pattern peaks in directions lying in the plane of the loop, because signals received from sources in that plane do not quite cancel owing to the phase difference between the arrival of the wave at the near side and far side of the loop. Increasing that phase difference by increasing the size of the loop has a large impact in increasing the radiation resistance and the resulting antenna efficiency. Another way of looking at a small loop as an antenna is to consider it simply as an inductive coil coupling to the magnetic field in the direction perpendicular to plane of the coil, according to Amp√®re's law. Then consider a propagating radio wave also perpendicular to that plane. Since the magnetic (and electric) fields of an electromagnetic wave in free space are transverse (no component in the direction of propagation), it can be seen that this magnetic field and that of a small loop antenna will be at right angles, and thus not coupled. For the same reason, an electromagnetic wave propagating within the plane of the loop, with its magnetic field perpendicular to that plane, is coupled to the magnetic field of the coil. Since the transverse magnetic and electric fields of a propagating electromagnetic wave are at right angles, the electric field of such a wave is also in the plane of the loop, and thus the antenna's polarization (which is always specified as being the orientation of the electric, not the magnetic field) is said to be in that plane. Thus mounting the loop in a horizontal plane will produce an omnidirectional antenna which is horizontally polarized; mounting the loop vertically yields a weakly directional antenna with vertical polarization and sharp nulls along the axis of the loop. Receiver input tuning Since a small loop antenna is essentially a coil, its electrical impedance is inductive, with an inductive reactance much greater than its radiation resistance. In order to couple to a transmitter or receiver, the inductive reactance is normally canceled with a parallel capacitance. Since a good loop antenna will have a high Q factor, this capacitor must be variable and is adjusted along with the receiver's tuning. Small loop receiving antennas are also almost always resonated using a parallel plate capacitor, which makes their reception narrow-band, sensitive only to a very specific frequency. This allows the antenna, in conjunction with a (variable) tuning capacitor, to act as a tuned input stage to the receiver's front-end, in lieu of a preselector. Insensitivity to locally generated interference Due to its direct coupling to the magnetic field, unlike most other antenna types, the small loop is relatively insensitive to electric-field noise from nearby sources. No matter how close the electrical interference is to the loop, its effect will not be much greater than if it were a quarter wavelength away. This is valuable since most sources of interference with radio frequency content, such as sparking at commutators or corona discharge, directly produce electric fields in the near-field (much less than a wavelength from the source). Since it is in the AM broadcast band and lower frequencies generally where these small loops are used, the near field region is physically quite large (on the order of 30 m, or 100 feet). This provides a considerable advantage for using an antenna which is relatively insensitive to the main interference sources encountered in that frequency range. The same principle makes a small loop particularly sensitive to sources of magnetic noise in its near field. Likewise, a Hertzian (short) dipole couples directly with the electric field and is relatively immune to locally produced magnetic noise. However at radio frequencies nearby sources of magnetic interference are generally not an issue. In either case the small antenna's immunity does not extend to noise sources outside of the near field: Noise sources over one wavelength distant, whether originating as an electric or magnetic field, are received simply as electromagnetic waves. Noise from outside any antenna's near field will be received equally well by any antenna sensitive to a radio transmitter from the direction of that noise source. =Direction finding with small loops= Loop antenna, receiver, and accessories used in amateur radio direction finding at 80 meter wavelength (3.5 MHz). Since the directional response of small loop antennas includes a sharp null in the direction normal to the plane of the loop, they are used in radio direction finding at longer wavelengths. The procedure is to rotate the loop antenna to find the direction where the signal vanishes - the ‚Äúnull‚Äù direction. Since the null occurs at two opposite directions along the axis of the loop, other means must be employed to determine which side of the antenna the ‚Äúnulled‚Äù signal is on. One method is to rely on a second loop antenna located at a second location, or to move the receiver to that other location, thus relying on triangulation. Instead of triangulation, a second dipole or vertical antenna can be electrically combined with a loop or a loopstick antenna. Called a sense antenna, connecting and matching the second antenna changes the combined radiation pattern to a cardioid, with a null in only one (less precise) direction. The general direction of the transmitter can be determined using the sense antenna, and then disconnecting the sense antenna returns the sharp nulls in the loop antenna pattern, allowing a precise bearing to be determined. =AM broadcast receiving antennas= Small loop antennas are lossy and inefficient for transmitting, but they can be practical receiving antennas for frequencies below 10 MHz. Especially in the mediumwave (520-1710 kHz) band and below, where wavelength-sized antennas are infeasibly large, and the antenna inefficiency is irrelevant, due to large amounts of atmospheric noise. AM broadcast receivers (and other low frequency radios for the consumer market) typically use small loop antennas, even when a telescoping antenna may be attached for FM reception. A variable capacitor connected across the loop forms a resonant circuit that also tunes the receiver's input stage as that capacitor tracks the main tuning. A multiband receiver may contain tap points along the loop winding in order to tune the loop antenna at widely different frequencies. In AM radios built prior to the discovery of ferrite in the mid-20th century, the antenna might consist of dozens of turns of wire mounted on the back wall of the radio - a planar helical antenna - or a separate, rotatable, furniture-sized rack looped with wire - a frame antenna. Ferrite Ferrite loopstick antenna from an AM radio having two windings, one for long wave and one for medium wave (AM broadcast) reception. About 10 cm long. Ferrite antennas are usually enclosed inside the radio receiver. Ferrite loop antennas are made by winding fine wire around a ferrite rod. They are almost universally used in AM broadcast receivers. Other names for this type of antenna are loopstick, ferrite rod antenna or aerial, ferroceptor, or ferrod antenna. Often at shortwave frequencies Litz wire is used for the winding to reduce skin effect losses. Elaborate ‚Äúbasket weave‚Äù patterns are used at all frequencies to reduce self-capacitance in the coil and raise the loop self-resonance above the operating frequency, consequently improving the loop Q factor. The ferrite increases the magnetic permeability and acts as a low-loss magnetic conductor - much better than air. This greater conductance channels thousands of times more magnetic power through the rod, and hence through the loop, allowing the physically small antenna to have a larger effective area. Loop-like antennas Some antennas look very much like loops, but are either not continuous loops, or are designed to couple with the inductive near-field - over distances of a meter or two - rather than to transmit or receive long-distance electromagnetic waves in the radiative far-field. =Halo antennas= Although it has a superficially similar appearance, the so-called halo antenna is not technically a loop since it possesses a break in the conductor opposite the feed point; that totally changes the current pattern since the voltages across the break are opposite and large. It is better analyzed as a dipole (which also has a large voltage and zero current at the ends) which has been bent into a circle. =RFID coils= Strictly speaking, RFID tags and readers interact by induction rather than transmission waves, and so are not antennas. The use of coupling coils for inductive (magnetic) transmission systems including LF and HF (rather than UHF) is outside the scope of this article. These systems do operate at radio frequencies, and do involve the use of small loops which are called \\"antennas\\" in the trade. Although these small loops are sometimes indistinguishable from the small loop antennas discussed here, such systems are not designed to transmit or receive signal waves (electromagnetic waves), and can only operate over short distances. They are near field systems involving alternating magnetic fields, and may be analyzed as poorly coupled transformer windings; their performance criteria are dissimilar to radio antennas as discussed here.

It broadcasts a Christian radio format of music and talk from studios in the Brisbane suburb of Underwood, to a network of more than 720 AM and FM radio frequencies. The station first broadcast on 1 February 1999 as Vision FM, with a single transmitter located at Beaudesert, Queensland. By 2001 it had established around 40 transmission sites, and 156 by 2004. The network's growth was assisted first by the purchase of 16 High-Powered Open Narrowcast (HPON) licenses in Western Sydney in 2002, and thereafter other HPON licenses in Victoria and Western Australia. In 2016, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) reported that it had 507 radio transmitters across Australia in all mainland states. Programming and availability A single national programming feed is broadcast to more than 720 towns, suburbs and cities in Australia, as well as remote areas via the Viewer Access Satellite Television platform. Major centres covered include Brisbane, Western Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth and the Gold Coast. The station broadcasts a mix of contemporary Christian music, messages from Christian national and international speakers and practical teaching. Vision also produces a national news service which is also syndicated to Christian community radio stations in Australia. Controversy In 2016, following an on-air segment with American Bible teacher Chuck Missler in which he criticised the Roman Catholic Church, Vision Christian Radio was found to have breached ACMA's Code of Conduct about acknowledging and responding to written complaints. ACMA dismissed related complaints that the network had perpetuated hatred or vilification during the interview.

The parish of Catshill was formed around the Turnpike Road (A38) in 1844. The population of Catshill in 2011 was 6,858. Education Catshill is home to Catshill First School and Catshill Middle School. The first school Catshill First School and Nursery is located in the centre of the village on Gibb Lane. The Middle School was built in 1939, and was converted from a Secondary Modern to a Middle School in 1970. The village has a small library, though it is not open every day. Catshill also has a village hall in which many different learning activities take place, from karate to IT skills. Transport Catshill is served by regular bus services by First Midland Red, Diamond West Midlands and MRD Travel. There are routes to Birmingham, Halesowen, Merry Hill, Stourbridge, Bromsgrove, Worcester and Droitwich. With nearby access to the M5 and M42 motorways, Catshill is within commuting distance by car to both Worcester and Birmingham and as a result the population of the village has grown in recent years. History In 1828 a Baptist chapel was opened in Little Catshill.Berrow's Worcester Journal, 28 August 1828 Catshill developed in the nineteenth century through nailmaking and by 1914 was one of the few villages in the area which produced nails. Famous people The poet Alfred Edward Housman lived in Catshill. The professional footballer Roy Hartle (Bolton Wanderers) was born here. For more than a quarter of a century Sarah Hilda Haines was the much respected district nurse (plaque in church) who received the royal Maundy in 1980 at Worcester.

The building was completed in 1998 and named in honor of Senator Pete Domenici at a ceremony in 2004. Since its completion it has been joined at the intersection of Fourth and Lomas by two additional courthouses, the Bernalillo County Courthouse on the southwest corner and the Metropolitan Courthouse on the northwest corner. The seven- story courthouse is tall, placing it tenth on the list of Albuquerque's tallest buildings. Planning for the courthouse began in 1993 and after some initial wrangling the city chose a two-block site north of Lomas between Third and Fourth streets. This plan was immediately embroiled in controversy because one of the blocks was the site of McClellan Park, which dated from 1919 and had housed New Mexico's Madonna of the Trail monument since 1928. Though McClellan Park had deteriorated badly by the 1990s, opponents of the courthouse maintained that the park was a historic landmark worthy of preservation. On the other hand, supporters of the courthouse, led by Mayor Martin Chavez, considered the park an eyesore that could be put to a better use as a site for new development. Eventually the city won out, and McClellan Park was bulldozed in 1996 as construction began on the courthouse. The Madonna of the Trail monument was moved to the northwest corner of the courthouse site, where it remains. References  External links  *Pete V.

He was born in Littlefield, Texas but his family moved to Lubbock soon after. He attended Texas Tech University where he drew cartoons for The University Daily student newspaper. He appeared as \\"Uncle Dirk\\" on a local children's program for three years while heading up his advertising agency, West Advertising. Beginning in the 1960s, he cartooned for the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal. Mascot cartoons West's most famous works featured caricatures of the sports mascots of various universities, mostly those of the Southwest Conference (and later the Big 12 Conference), but other schools appeared as well, usually because they were playing Texas Tech. His cartoons appeared in program books, on posters, and in magazines. Two of his characters would eventually be officially adopted by their respective universities: Texas Tech's Raider Red and the University of Nebraska's Herbie Husker.Husker Press Box - Whatever Happened To Harry Husker? West drew a semi-weekly one-panel comic in the Avalanche-Journal's sports section where he would lampoon college mascots and coaches alike, as well as the stereotypes of various universities. Thus there was the dim-witted Texas A&M; Aggie, the devout but overemotional Baylor Bear, the arrogant University of Texas at Austin Longhorn and of course Raider Red, whose bullet-riddled Stetson showed by the number of holes the number of game losses for Texas Tech so far that season. West would alter the image of his characters over the course of a sports season. A winning team's mascot would gradually get larger and tougher, the fans of losing teams would find their mascots growing thinner as the weeks went by. Politics After serving several years on the local Parks and Recreation Board and the city council, West was elected mayor of Lubbock in 1978, but disliked politics so much as a result that he did not run for a second term (his single term ran from 1978-1980). He returned to his advertising agency and his cartooning, both of which he kept up until his death from a heart attack in 1996. An exhibition dedicated to West and his work opened September 25, 2005, at the Museum of Texas Tech University. It ran through January 2006.

History The plan was drafted in 2002 by Dr Barbara Vernon Dr Tracy Reibel, and Dr Sally Tracy as representatives of the Maternity Coalition. It arose out of the recognition that up to 2002, States and Territory maternity lobby groups had worked independently for change, but until they were united in seeking the same outcomes, the Federal and State Governments would not change funding methods. The Plan was launched on 24 September 2002 simultaneously in Canberra, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth. The plan was launched at Parliament House in Canberra by: * Dr Carmen Lawrence, Shadow Minister for the Status of Women, Australian Labor Party * Senator Kerry Nettle, Australian Greens * Senator Aden Ridgeway, Australian Democrats * Senator Meg Lees (Independent) * Jackie Kelly, Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister Life Matters News 1 Oct 2002 The Plan was subsequently launched in Mount Gambier in South Australia and Mareeba in Queensland. Content The NMAP was prepared by a broad coalition of consumer and midwifery representatives and organisations from across Australia. The NMAP outlines the rationale behind the need for major reform of maternity services, and, proposes a strategy for Federal and State/Territory governments to enable comprehensive implementation of community midwifery services in both urban and regional/rural Australia within the public health system. The NMAP calls on both Federal and State/Territory governments to facilitate substantial change to the way in which maternity services are provided, by making available to all women the choice of having a community midwife provide continuous maternity care through the publicly funded health system. Community midwifery services in the main provide continuity of midwifery led care to healthy women throughout the childbearing continuum, in collaboration with other practitioners such as general practitioners and specialist obstetricians, where indicated. Midwives are able to follow individual women across the interface between community and acute health services and to provide care to each woman from early in her pregnancy until the baby is 4-6 weeks of age. Universal access to continuity of midwifery care will ensure savings in health dollars and bring Australia into line with international best practice in addition to meeting community demands for a range of readily accessible and appropriate maternity services. Community midwifery is informed by international best practice standards that acknowledge midwives as ‚Äúthe most appropriate and cost effective type of health care provider to be assigned to the care of women in normal pregnancy and birth, including the risk assessment and the recognition of complications‚Äù (World Health Organization, 1999, Care in Normal Birth). In other western countries, particularly in the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Canada, midwifery is promoted and funded both as a public health and a primary health strategy, since community based care from midwives can be responsive to local needs, particularly with regard to health inequalities and social exclusion. Continuity of midwifery care has been proven to result in fewer women needing expensive obstetric interventions, such as caesarean surgery and operative deliveries. Research also shows that such care contributes to long-term breastfeeding, improved adjustment to parenting, and may lower the incidence of postnatal depression. Widespread access for pregnant women and their families to continuous care provided by community midwives would: * Provide women with care that is as safe as current routine care * Provide women with the choice of a midwife as their lead maternity carer in line with international best practice * Improve maternal and infant outcomes * Reduce the need for costly obstetric interventions in childbirth for the majority of pregnant women * Be at least as, if not more cost effective than conventional models of maternity care.

It is home to about 160,000 people, and is also the native land of the Wassoulou genre of music. Wassoulou surrounds the point where the borders of three present-day countries meet: Mali, Sierra Leone,Ivory Coast, and Guinea. It includes portions of southwestern Mali, northwestern Ivory Coast, and eastern Guinea. It is bordered by the Niger River to the northwest, and by the Sankarani River to the east. The name Wassoulou is alternately spelled Wassulu, Wassalou, and Ouassalou. Culture Wassoulou is the birthplace of Wassoulou music, a style which blends traditional and modern influences with strong female vocalists and a pentatonic hunter's harp. Wassoulou music is one of the two forms of West African music ethnomusicologists believe to be the origin of the American blues, which developed out of music forms dating back to the American slave trade from West Africa. Some of the most famous residents of Wassoulou include the singers Oumou Sangare, Ramata Diakite and Coumba Sidibe. Wassoulou's cultural importance is reflected in the development of internet resources, and the creation of Radio Wassoulou broadcasting from Yanfolila. =Language= Wassoulou is also a dialect of the Eastern Maninkakan language, and is closely related to Kankan Mandinka. Speakers of Wassoulou number some 73,500 in Guinea, with 41,200 speakers estimated in Mali, where the closely related Bamanankan is also spoken. In the far northwest of C√¥te d'Ivoire there are some 21,000 Wassoulou speakers, where it is related to Wojenaka Maninka. Inhabitants are known as Wassulu, Wassulunka or Wassulunke. History The Wassoulou area is a center for the mingling of several ethnic groups. The nomadic Fula people, who were believed to have emigrated from the Fouta Djallon highlands to the west, integrated into the indigenous Mand√© peoples and adopting their language and customs sometime prior to the 18th century, at roughly the same time Islam spread into the area. There are also large populations of Mandinka peoples native to Wassoulou. Wassoulou is also the name of an Islamic state, the Wassoulou Empire (1870‚Äì1898), ruled by Samori Ture and centered on his capital, Bissandugu. In 1870, Samori overthrew an older Wassoulou state within the Kingdom of K√©n√©dougou, whose faama (ruler) was Dyanabufarina Modi, and expanded his empire from there, taking the Wassoulou name. While the history of the Mandinka Wassoulou states remain unclear, the small kingdoms of Kenedugu and Wassulu existed from at least the 1650s, benefiting from gold mining and trade in the area.

Alison left the Church of England at the age of eighteen to join the Roman Catholic Church. He studied at Blackfriars College at the University of Oxford, and earned his bachelor's degree and doctorate in theology from the Jesuit theology faculty in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. He has lived and worked in Mexico, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, and the United States. Currently he works as a travelling preacher, lecturer and retreat giver, based in Madrid, Spain.  Laicisation controversy  Alison was a member of the Dominican order ‚Äì his master's degree is a Dominican lectorate ‚Äì from 1981 to 1995. In 1996, he wrote to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith telling them that he believed his vows to be null as they were based on the \\"false premise of gay people being objectively disordered and thus celibacy being obligatory\\". He offered to let them issue a decree saying that his ordination was null, but they declined, saying it was valid. Instead, the congregation asked him to seek laicisation, but Alison declined: \\"The form for doing that also required that lies to be told, so, on advice of a canon lawyer, I did nothing and heard nothing\\". He told Commonweal magazine in 2012 that he was released from the Dominicans without penalty, and that he is uncertain of the validity of his vow of celibacy. More than 10 years later, a superior in the Dominican order asked if Alison would object to his processing paperwork dismissing Alison from the order. Alison said he did not mind the paperwork, but would not participate as he believed he was never truly a member anyway. He eventually received a letter stating that he was a priest in good standing, not currently incardinated but available to be incardinated if a bishop wished to have him. While living in Brazil, the local bishop asked for Alison's consent to be laicized. Alison declined, but instead offered to be incardinated into the diocese. The bishop declined that offer. The bishop then began a process of laicization without Alison's consent using the norm designed for priest who left their ministry to get married and would not answer requests for cooperation; Alison believed this was not applicable in his situation. A year later, a letter from the Congregation for the Clergy arrived announcing that Alison had been laicized, forbidding him from teaching, preaching, or presiding. According to the letter, this decision was unappealable. For Alison, \\"it was shocking to be tangential to a process in which it is unnecessary to inform the one charged of the charges against him, in which no legal representation is permitted, and whose sentence does not require the signature of the sentencee\\". A friendly bishop, who was once Alison's novice master, hand delivered a letter to Pope Francis in May 2017 appealing his laicization. In the letter, Alison asked the Pope to make his situation regular; he proposed to treat the congregation's letter \\"as null, and to carry on as before\\". On 2 July 2017, Pope Francis called Alison directly. According to Alison, Pope Francis told him, \\"I want you to walk with deep interior freedom, following the Spirit of Jesus. And I give you the power of the keys.\\" Alison believes that, Pope Francis did not perceive the congregation's decision as binding; that he treated him as a priest and granted him the authority to hear confessions.

Mandu can be steamed, boiled, pan- fried, or deep-fried. The styles also vary across regions in Korean Peninsula. Mandu were long part of Korean royal court cuisine, but are now found in supermarkets, restaurants, and snack places such as pojangmacha and bunsikjip throughout Korea.  Names and etymology  The name is cognate with the names of similar types of meat-filled dumplings along the Silk Road in Central Asia, such as Uyghur manta (), Turkish ', Kazakh m√§nti (), Uzbek ', Afghan ' and Armenian mant øi (). Chinese m√°ntou (; ) is also considered a cognate, which used to mean meat-filled dumplings, but now refers to steamed buns without any filling.http://www.fuchsiadunlop.com/dumpling-heaven-in-adelaide/ Mandu can be divided into gyoja () type and poja () type. In Chinese, the categories of dumplings are called ji«éozi (; ) and bƒÅozi () respectively, which are cognates with the Korean words. In Japanese, the former-type dumplings are called gy≈çza (), which is also a cognate. In Mongolian, the latter-type dumplings are called buuz (), which is also a cognate. History Mandu are believed to have been first brought to Korea by Yuan Mongolians in the 14th century during the reign of the Goryeo dynasty. Mandu at Doosan Encyclopedia The state religion of Goryeo was Buddhism, which discouraged consumption of meat. The Mongolian incursion into Goryeo relaxed the religious prohibition against consuming meat, and mandu was among the newly imported dishes that included meat. Another possibility is mandu came to Korea at a much earlier period from the Middle East through the Silk Road. Historians point out many cuisines based on wheat, such as dumplings and noodles which originated from Mesopotamia and gradually spread from there. It also spread east along the Silk Road, leaving many versions of mandu throughout Central and East Asia. Mandu , Hankook Ilbo, 2009-01-21 A Goryeo era folk song Ssanghwajeom tells a story of mandu shop (ssanghwa meaning \\"dumplings\\", and jeom meaning \\"shop\\") run by a foreigner, probably of Central Asian origin.Mandu, Great Food, Great Stories From Korea Varieties If the dumplings are grilled or fried, they are called gun-mandu (Íµ∞ÎßåÎëê); when steamed, jjin-mandu (Ï∞êÎßåÎëê); and when boiled, mul-mandu (Î¨ºÎßåÎëê).Favorite foods, Korean Tourism Organization In North Korea, mandu styles vary in different regions of the country.

Scott and Harold Brown, his solo work, and as a harmonica manufacturer. He continues to play with 3 other original War band members, Harold Brown, Howard Scott and B.B. Dickerson, under the name LowRider Band. Early life and career Born in Copenhagen, Denmark in 1948, Oskar was six years old when a family friend gave him his first harmonica. \\"I came from an area where every kid on the block had a harmonica\\", he remembers. He grew up listening to Danish radio, enjoying all types of music and cites Ray Charles as the biggest influence from that period. When he was 17, Oskar decided that the United States was where a harmonica player should make his career. So he moved to New York at the age of 18 with little more than a harmonica in his pocket. With no money, Oskar played harmonica in the streets of New York. Eventually arriving in Los Angeles, via Toronto and San Francisco, Oskar soon met and joined forces with Eric Burdon who had recently disbanded The Animals and was searching for new collaborators. Together, the harmonica-playing Dane (born Lee Oskar Levitin) and the British blues-rock singer made the rounds of the L.A. clubs, eventually hooking up with the soon-to-be members of War. Burdon agreed to the novel idea of pairing up Oskar's harmonica with Charles Miller's saxophone to form a horn section. This team-up set War apart from the start, giving Oskar room to display the full spectrum of his improvisational prowess. Oskar's harmonica magic was always a vital element in War's music and performances. Oskar continued with War for 24 years non-stop. At the end of 1992, during the time of dispute over the WAR trademark, Oskar took a few years to continue his solo career and to focus on his Lee Oskar Harmonica manufacturing. War Lee Oskar has been described as \\"a virtuoso\\", \\"the harmonica whiz\\", \\"a war hero\\", \\"legendary\\", a master of \\"musical wizardry\\", and considered \\"...among the best rock-blues-soul harmonica players\\". His role as a founding member and former lead harmonica player of the pioneer funk-jazz group War won him international renown for over two and a half decades (1969‚Äì1993). Oskar's signature solos helped to define the War sound from the band's beginning in 1969, adding dashes of color to its R&B;, jazz, rock, and Latin influences. Oskar's position with War was a prominent one from its early days with singer Eric Burdon onward. \\"My playing has become more aggressive over the years\\", he says. \\"In the beginning, my role was playing horn lines. Today, it's evolved to the point where I'm playing a lead instrument. If I'm not doing a solo, I'm playing counterlines ‚Äî I try to paint within certain spaces in the music to help create the overall picture.\\" His biggest worldwide hit was \\"Before The Rain\\". Solo career The eclectic, multicultural nature of War's music is also evident in Oskar's solo projects. Three well regarded albums released between 1976 and 1981 (and recently rereleased on CD) brought critical and popular acclaim including being voted No. 1 Instrumental Artist of the Year for 1976 in Billboard, Cashbox and Record World. The albums, like Oskar's live performances, show the diverse influences of his musicality. A composer, his compositions have been featured on movie sound tracks and television commercials. He has been the recipient of many Gold and Platinum recordings and honored with special ASCAP Writing Awards. His music has more recently influenced the song \\"Timber\\", which was performed by rapper Pitbull and Kesha; which was inspired by Oskar's melodic harmonica playing within his song \\"San Francisco Bay\\". Lee Oskar harmonica In 1983, Oskar formed a company to manufacture high-quality harmonicas. His company, Lee Oskar Harmonica, sells harmonicas suited to many different styles of music, including the most common blues, folk, rock, R&B; and country but Oskar's altered tunings also allows players to explore other genres such as Tango, Clave, Hip Hop, Reggae, Ska, Latin, Gypsy, Yiddish, Eastern European, Asian, and many other types of music. The harmonicas themselves are manufactured by Tombo of Japan. Oskar's harmonica company celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2008 at the NAMM Show. and has now surpassed his 35th anniversary. Lee Oskar harmonicas are praised because of replacement parts which allows changing reed plates when they become fatigued by normal use. This also allows mixing different tunings. Several modern musicians, such as Mike Tetrault, cited Oskar as an important influence. When Junior Wells died, he was buried with a tray of Lee Oskar harmonicas.  Personal life  Oskar lives in Everett, Washington in the United States as of 2019.

It was built in 1927 in the extravagant Art Deco-Pueblo Revival Style architecture, which is a blend of adobe building styles (rounded corners and edges), decorative motifs from indigenous cultures, and the soaring lines and linear repetition found in American Art Deco architecture.For examples of this style of building, see Marcus Whiffen, Pueblo Deco: The Art Deco Architecture of the Southwest (). History The KiMo was conceived by Italian-American entrepreneur Oreste Bachechi (c. 1860‚Äì1928) and his wife, Maria Franceschi Bachechi (c. 1865‚Äì1959). It was Mrs. Bachechi's desire to give a tribute to the Native Americans who had embraced the Bachechi family as part of their own. After much travel and meetings with various architects in both NM and California, the design was accepted from Carl Boller of the Boller Brothers architecture firm, who conducted an extensive investigation into the cultures and building styles of the Southwest before submitting his design. The theater is a three-story stucco building with the stepped massing characteristic of native pueblo architecture, as well as the recessed spandrels and strong vertical thrust of Art Deco skyscrapers. Both the exterior and interior of the building incorporate a variety of indigenous motifs, like the row of terra cotta shields above the third-floor windows. In June 1927, the Albuquerque Journal sponsored a competition to choose a name for the new theater, with a $50 prize for the winner. The rules stipulated that the name \\"must be in keeping with this truly American Theatre, whose architecture is a combination of Aztec, Navajo and Pueblo. It must be an Indian name. The name must not have more than six letters.\\" Over 500 entries were received from around the state. Pablo Abeita, the former governor of Isleta Pueblo, was chosen as the winner for his suggestion of \\"Kimo\\", meaning \\"mountain lion\\" (sometimes loosely translated as \\"king of the beasts\\"). The second-place entry was \\"Eloma\\". The theater opened on September 19, 1927, with a program including Native American dancers and singers, a performance on the newly installed $18,000 Wurlitzer theater organ, and the comedy film Painting the Town. Dignitaries at the event included Senator Sam G. Bratton, former governor Arthur T. Hannett, and Chairman of the City Commission Clyde Tingley, while Hollywood stars including Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks sent congratulatory telegrams. Cecil B. DeMille wrote, \\"The erection of such a theater is definite proof of the great progress being made by this industry of ours.\\" In 1935, the Bachechi family merged their theater interests with those of Joseph Barnett, including the Sunshine Theater, which put most of Albuquerque's theaters under the same ownership. By 1952, the chain, Albuquerque Exhibitors, controlled 10 local theaters and had 170 employees. The company leased its theaters in 1956 to the Texas-based Frontier Theaters chain, which was taken over by Commonwealth Theaters in 1967. Commonwealth closed the theater in 1970, after which it was leased for a few years by Albuquerque Music Theater and then started showing adult films. By 1977, the theater had fallen into disrepair due to a fire. The City of Albuquerque offered to purchase the building at a fraction of its value or condemn it and then demolish it. The family decided that it was best to preserve the theater for future generations and sold the theater to the City of Albuquerque. It has undergone several phases of continuing restoration to return it to its former glory and is once again open to the public for performances. The most recent preservation was completed in 2000 with the installation of new seating and carpet, main stage curtain, new tech booth, lighting positions hid between and behind \\"vigas\\" on the ceiling, and a re- creation of the KiMo's original proscenium arch. The auditorium seating capacity was 650 at completion of the restoration. In 2011, the city commissioned a replica of the theater's original neon sign, which was installed around 1929 and removed sometime in the 1950s. The completed sign, which is tall by wide and cost $16,000, was installed in June 2011. Alleged haunting According to local legend, the KiMo Theatre is haunted by the ghost of Bobby Darnall, a six-year-old boy killed in 1951 when a water heater in the theater's lobby exploded. The tale alleges that a theatrical performance of A Christmas Carol in 1974 was disrupted by the ghost, who was supposedly angry that the staff was ordered to remove donuts they had hung on backstage pipes to appease him. While investigating the legend, writer Benjamin Radford determined that the performance of A Christmas Carol in question actually occurred in 1986, not 1974, and two people he spoke with who were involved in the production did not remember anything unusual. According to Radford, \\"All the evidence points to one inescapable conclusion: The ruined play‚Äîthe very genesis of the KiMo ghost story‚Äîsimply did not occur; it is but folklore and fiction\\". Radford also contacted Bobby Darnall's siblings, who told him they felt \\"exploited by the story\\" and did not appreciate \\"claims that their beloved brother is eating doughnuts or ruining performances at the KiMo Theater\\".Ghosts, Doughnuts, and A Christmas Carol: Investigating New Mexico‚Äôs ‚ÄòHaunted‚Äô KiMo Theater by Ben Radford on csicop.org Gallery File:KiMo theater stage.JPGInterior of the KiMo theater.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, NASA formally studied a cargo-only vehicle, Shuttle-C, that would have supplemented the crewed Space Shuttle. In 2005, NASA was developing the Ares I and Ares V launch vehicles, based in part on highly modified Shuttle components, to enable exploration of the Moon and Mars. The agency also studied a third such vehicle, the Ares IV.  Concepts  SDV concepts are/were proposed even before the Space Shuttle itself began flying. = Shuttle-C = The Shuttle-C was a study by NASA to turn the Space Shuttle launch stack into a dedicated uncrewed cargo launcher. The Space Shuttle external tank and Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) would be combined with a cargo module in place of the shuttle orbiter including the RS-25 engines. Various Shuttle-C concepts were investigated between 1984 and 1995. = National Launch System = The National Launch System (or New Launch System) was a study authorized in 1991 by President George H. W. Bush to outline alternatives to the Space Shuttle for access to Earth orbit. Shortly thereafter, NASA asked Lockheed Missiles and Space, McDonnell Douglas, and TRW to perform a ten-month study. A series of launch vehicles was proposed, based around the proposed Space Transportation Main Engine (STME) liquid-fuel rocket engine. The STME was to be a simplified, expendable version of the Space Shuttle main engine (SSME). The NLS-1 was the largest of three proposed vehicles and would have used a modified Space Shuttle external tank for its core stage. The tank would have fed liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen to four STMEs attached to the bottom of the tank. A payload or second stage would have fit atop the core stage, and two detachable Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters would have been mounted on the sides of the core stage as on the Shuttle. Period illustrations suggest that much larger rockets than NLS-1 were contemplated, using multiples of the NLS-1 core stage. =Constellation program= Comparison of the Ares I, Ares IV, and Ares V rockets. One of the main goals of Constellation program was the development of spacecraft and booster vehicles to replace the Space Shuttle. NASA had already begun designing two boosters, the Ares I and Ares V, when the program was created. Ares I was designed for the sole purpose of launching mission crews into orbit, while Ares V would have been used to launch other hardware which required a heavier lift capacity than the Ares I booster provided. Ares I Ares I was the crew launch vehicle that was being developed by NASA as part of the Constellation program. The name \\"Ares\\" refers to the Greek deity Ares, who is identified with the Roman god Mars. Ares I was originally known as the \\"Crew Launch Vehicle\\" (CLV). NASA planned to use Ares I to launch Orion, the spacecraft intended for NASA human spaceflight missions after the Space Shuttle was retired in 2011. Ares I was to complement the larger, uncrewed Ares V, which was the cargo launch vehicle for Constellation. NASA selected the Ares designs for their anticipated overall safety, reliability and cost-effectiveness. However, the Constellation program, including Ares I was cancelled by U.S. president Barack Obama in October 2010 with the passage of his 2010 NASA authorization bill. Ares V The Ares V (formerly known as the Cargo Launch Vehicle or CaLV) was the planned cargo launch component of the cancelled NASA Constellation program, which was to have replaced the Space Shuttle after its retirement in 2011. Ares V was also planned to carry supplies for a human presence on Mars. Ares V and the smaller Ares I were named after Ares, the Greek god of war. The Ares V was to launch the Earth Departure Stage and Altair lunar lander for NASA's return to the Moon, which was planned for 2019. It would also have served as the principal launcher for missions beyond the Earth-Moon system, including the program's ultimate goal, a crewed mission to Mars. The uncrewed Ares V would complement the smaller, and human-rated Ares I rocket for the launching of the 4‚Äì6 person Orion spacecraft. Both rockets, deemed safer than the then-current Space Shuttle, would have employed technologies developed for the Apollo program, the Shuttle program, and the Delta IV EELV program. However, the Constellation program, including Ares V was cancelled by U.S. president Barack Obama in October 2010 with the passage of his 2010 NASA authorization bill. Ares IV The Ares IV concept combines an Ares I upper stage on top of an Ares V. Specifically, the vehicle would consist of the liquid-fueled core stage from the Ares V design, two five-segment solid rocket boosters, and the liquid- fueled upper stage from the Ares I, as described by NASA in January 2007. The Ares IV would be a combined tall and could be used to reach the Moon. Total payload capacity would be to for direct trans-lunar injection. NASA had considered using Ares IV to evaluate high-speed \\"skip\\" reentry profiles of the Orion capsule in 2007. NASA had planned flight demonstrations of Ares I and Ares V hardware in \\"Heavy Lift\\" configurations beginning in 2013. The \\"Heavy Lift\\" test flights were to test the first stage of the Ares V simultaneously with the Ares I upper stage attached on top to save both time and money. The later Heavy Lift test vehicle configurations are similar to the Ares IV vehicle.Bergin, Chris. \\"Ambitious Ares test flight plan proposed for HLV demonstrations\\". Nasaspaceflight.com, May 10, 2010. Ares V Lite Ares V Lite was an alternative launch vehicle for NASA's Constellation program suggested by the Augustine Commission. Ares V Lite was a scaled down Ares V.Coppinger, Rob. \\"Will Constellation live on?\\". Flight International, August 11, 2009.Madrigal, Alexis. \\"Human Spaceflight Ball in Obama‚Äôs Court\\". Wired, October 22, 2009. It would have used five RS-68 engines and two five-segment SRBs and have had a low Earth orbit payload of approximately . If chosen, Ares V Lite would have replaced the Ares V and Ares I launchers. One Ares V Lite version would have been a cargo lifter like Ares V and the second version would have carried astronauts in the Orion spacecraft.Augustine Committee 2009, pp. 38, 64‚Äì67, 80.  NASA Side-Mount Vehicle  The Shuttle-Derived Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle (HLV) was an alternate super heavy-lift launch vehicle proposal for the NASA Constellation program. It was first presented to the Augustine Commission on 17 June 2009. Based on the Shuttle-C concept which has been the subject of various studies since the 1980s, the HLV was a SDLV that proposed to replace the winged Orbiter from the Space Shuttle stack with a side-mounted payload carrier. The Space Shuttle external tank (ET) and Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) would have remained the same. = Jupiter = The Jupiter family of super heavy-lift launch vehicles was part of the proposed DIRECT Shuttle-Derived Launch Vehicle architecture. It was intended to be the alternative to the Ares I and Ares V rockets. Major benefits were projected from re-using as much hardware and facilities from the Space Shuttle program as possible, including cost savings, experience with existing hardware, and preserving the workforce. =Space Launch System= The Space Launch System (SLS) is a US super heavy-lift expendable launch vehicle, which is under development as of August 2019. It is the primary launch vehicle of NASA's deep space exploration plans, including the planned crewed lunar flights of the Artemis program and a possible follow-on human mission to Mars. =Liberty= Liberty was a 2011 launch vehicle concept proposed by Alliant Techsystems (ATK) and Astrium for phase 2 of the NASA Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) program intended to stimulate development of privately operated crew vehicles to low Earth orbit. Similar to the defunct Ares I project, which consisted of a five segment Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) and a new cryogenic second stage, Liberty would combine a five-segment SRB with the core stage of the European Ariane 5 as a second stage.Canceled NASA Rocket Could Return as Part of Low-Cost Space Taxi  Gallery  File:Shuttle-c launch painting.jpgArtist's concept of the Shuttle-C launch vehicle.

Milling is among the oldest of human occupations. \\"Miller\\", \\"Milne\\", and other variants are common surnames, as are their equivalents in other languages around the world (\\"Melnyk\\" in Russian, Belorussian & Ukrainian, \\"Meunier\\" in French, \\"M√ºller\\" or \\"Mueller\\" in German, \\"Mulder\\" and \\"Molenaar\\" in Dutch, \\"Moln√°r\\" in Hungarian, \\"Molinero\\" in Spanish, \\"Molinaro\\" or \\"Molinari\\" in Italian etc.). Milling existed in hunter- gatherer communities, and later millers were important to the development of agriculture. The materials ground by millers are often foodstuffs and particularly grain. The physical grinding of the food allows for the easier digestion of its nutrients and saves wear on the teeth. Non-food substances needed in a fine, powdered form, such as building materials, may be processed by a miller.  Quern-stone  A bedstone and rind. Dalgarven Mill, Scotland. The most basic tool for a miller was the quern-stone‚Äîsimply a large, fixed stone as a base and another movable stone operated by hand, similar to a mortar and pestle. As technology and millstones (the bedstone and rynd) improved, more elaborate machines such as watermills and windmills were developed to do the grinding work. These mills harnessed available energy sources including animal, water, wind, and electrical power. Mills are some of the oldest factories in human history, so factories making other items are sometimes known as mills, for example, cotton mills and steel mills. These factory workers are also called millers. The rynd in pre-reformation Scotland was often carved on millers' gravestones as a symbol of their trade.  Status  In a traditional rural society, a miller is often wealthier than ordinary peasants, which can lead to jealousy. Millers are often accused of associating with thieves, and were targeted in bread riots at times of famine. Conversely, millers might be in a stronger position vis-a-vis feudal land owners than are ordinary peasants.  Carnival  medieval miller at a festival in Monselice, in Italy. The traditional carnival held annually in the city of Ivrea, Italy, commemorates a spirited \\"Mugnaia\\" (miller's daughter) who supposedly refused to let a local duke exercise his right of the first night, and proceeded to chop the duke's head off and spark a revolution. Whatever the historical validity of the story, it is significant it was the daughter of a miller to whom folk tradition assigned this rebellious role. Miller's thumb As an important part of his job, the miller repeatedly takes into his hand samples of the ground meal coming out of the spout in order to feel the quality and character of the product. The miller rubs the grain between his thumb and forefinger. After years of doing this, the miller's thumb changes shape and becomes broad and flattened. This is known as a \\"miller's thumb\\". Sayings such as \\"worth a millerÀàs thumb\\" and \\"an honest miller hath a golden thumb\\" refers to the profit the miller makes as a result of this skill. The shape of a miller's thumb is said to have the appearance of the head of a fish. The European bullhead (Cottus gobio), a freshwater fish, is commonly called a miller's thumb for this reason.The Athenaeum, Issues 375-426 (London, 1835) p. 297. See also * Gristmill, a name for grain mills * Medieval watermills, a list of early medieval watermills References  Surname  Miller (also known as Millar) is a common surname derived from the old English surname Milleiir.

Despite its medieval origins, to which only a 16th-century palace (Palazzo Pio) of the House of Este bears witness today, it was transformed by the Fascist Minister of Agriculture Edmondo Rossoni, who was born in Tresigallo in 1884. From his ministry in Rome, he developed and supervised the new village map, completely rebuilding it from 1927 to 1934.

The basic ideology of the Parchamites was one of a gradual move towards socialism in Afghanistan. The Parcham faction supported this idea because they felt that Afghanistan was not industrialized enough to undergo a true proletarian revolution as called for in the Communist Manifesto. The Parcham faction had more urban based members who belonged to the middle and upper middle classes. Opposed to the more moderate Parchamis were the radical Khalq faction. The Khalq (meaning \\"People\\") developed a more vigorous line, advocating an immediate and violent overthrow of the government and an establishment of a Soviet-style communist regime. Many pro-Parcham military officers supported Mohammed Daoud Khan's coup of 1973. Afterwards a high number of Parchamites held high-ranking jobs in Khan's cabinet and the Central Committee. Parchamites, then in charge of the Ministry of Interior, are believed to be responsible for the alleged murder of Mohammad Hashim Maiwandwal, an anti-communist former prime minister.https://books.google.com/books?id=hzIDCgAAQBAJ&pg;=PT371 In the next years, Parchamites were purged one by one from Khan's cabinet. In 1977 Parcham reunited with Khalq and following the Saur Revolution of 1978 many Parchamites were represented in the government. Relations with Khalq detoriated again and Parchamites were purged from the government by the Khalqist leadership of Nur Muhammad Taraki. The Parcham faction seized power in the country after the toppling of Hafizullah Amin in December 1979 by the Soviet Union's Operation Storm-333. Parcham leader Babrak Karmal was replaced by Mohammad Najibullah in 1986. In June 1990, the Parcham-led PDPA converted itself into the Watan Party (Homeland Party), with references to Marxism-Leninism removed.

Life and work William Davis Ticknor was born on August 6, 1810, on the outskirts of Lebanon, New Hampshire, the oldest boy of nine brothers and sisters.Tryon, W. S. Parnassus Corner: A Life of James T. Fields, Publisher to the Victorians. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1963: 55. His parents, William and Betsey (Ellis) Ticknor, were prosperous farmers. His cousin was the famous writer and historian George Ticknor. As a boy, Ticknor worked on the family farm during the summers and attended the district school during the winters. In 1827 at age seventeen he left home and went to Boston. He was first employed in the brokerage house of his uncle Benjamin. When his uncle died a few years later he was offered a position at the Columbian Bank, a position he held for a year or two. In 1832 he went into partnership with John Allen forming the publishing house of Allen and Ticknor which operated out of the Old Corner Bookstore. The following year Allen withdrew and Ticknor carried on the house under the name William D. Ticknor and Company, which would remain the legal name of the firm until his death. In 1837 he published the national monthly American Magazine of Useful and Entertaining Knowledge. On December 25, 1832, he married Emeline Staniford Holt. They had seven children together; only five survived into adulthood. Their three sons Howard Malcom, Benjamin Holt and Thomas Baldwin Ticknor all graduated from Harvard and entered into their father's firm. During the Civil War, Benjamin Holt Ticknor enlisted in the Forty-Fifth Regiment of Massachusetts Volunteers and was commissioned as second lieutenant of Company G until May 1863. He was commissioned as second lieutenant in the Second Massachusetts Heavy Artillery. He was later commissioned as captain of Company E and was in command of the recruiting camp at Readville, Massachusetts. He resigned from service shortly after his father's death. In 1845 the imprint of the firm was changed to Ticknor, Reed and Fields, after John Reed and James Thomas Fields were admitted as partners. It continued under this imprint until 1854 when John Reed withdrew and the name was changed to the well-known Ticknor and Fields. James Thomas Fields, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and William Ticknor With the widely varying but well matched talents of the two partners, Ticknor and Fields grew to become one of the leading publishing houses in the 19th century. Ticknor was the first American publisher to pay foreign authors for the rights to their works, beginning with a check to Alfred Tennyson in 1842. From the Old Corner Book Store, Ticknor and Fields published the works of Horatio Alger, Lydia Maria Child, Charles Dickens, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, James Russell Lowell, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Tennyson, Henry David Thoreau, Mark Twain, and John Greenleaf Whittier. The firm also published the Atlantic Monthly, Our Young Folks, and the North American Review. During his life Ticknor was very involved with the Baptist church. He was a director of the Boston Lyceum, treasurer of the American Institute of Instruction, a trustee of the Perkins Institute, and a leading member of the School Committee. He was also a resident member of the New England Historic Genealogical Society. Shortly after the firm contracted for Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter, Ticknor became a close friend and advisor to Hawthorne. =Death= Grave of William Ticknor at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts In the spring of 1864 Hawthorne's health was failing. Both Ticknor and Sophia Hawthorne insisted on a restorative health trip.McFarland, Philip. Hawthorne in Concord. New York: Grove Press, 2004: 288. During their trip, Ticknor's health suddenly failed. He caught what he assumed was a cold before leaving Boston, and Hawthorne later wrote home that his friend had eaten bad oysters. By the time they reached New York, his illness was determined to be pneumonia.Wineapple, Brenda. Hawthorne: A Life. New York: Random House, 2003: 371. Ticknor was more concerned about Hawthorne, writing to Sophia, \\"You will be glad to hear that your patient continues to improve.\\"McFarland, Philip. Hawthorne in Concord. New York: Grove Press, 2004: 289. In Philadelphia, the duo visited Fairmount Park and Ticknor offered Hawthorne his jacket for warmth before they returned to the Continental Hotel. Hawthorne wrote to Fields that \\"our friend Ticknor is suffering under a billious attack... He had previously seemed uncomfortable, but not to an alarming degree.\\"McFarland, Philip. Hawthorne in Concord. New York: Grove Press, 2004: 290. A physician offered various medicines, but Ticknor died on the morning of April 10, 1864. George William Childs arrived shortly after and accompanied the distraught and grieving Hawthorne back to Boston.Wineapple, Brenda. Hawthorne: A Life. New York: Random House, 2003: 372. The sudden loss of Ticknor was devastating to the already failing health of Hawthorne, who would die about a month later on May 19. Ticknor was buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery; the distinguished of both literary and business circles came to pay their final tribute.

It is located in Olsztyn County and has a predominantly Catholic population of approximately 11,400. The countryside surrounding Biskupiec is a popular tourist destination, part of the Masurian Lake District. History Gothic Saint John the Baptist church The town's name derived from the Prince-Bishops of Warmia, who had a castle built in the southeastern outskirts of their realm on the Dymer creek in the late 14th century. The fortress was first mentioned in a 1389 deed, the settlement that had developed nearby received town privileges according to Kulm law by Bishop Henry III Sorbom in 1395. The town sided with the Prussian Confederation, at the request of which King Casimir IV Jagiellon signed the act of incorporation of the region to Poland in 1454. The town and castle were devastated during the subsequent Thirteen Years' War (1454‚Äì66) between the rebellious Prussian Confederation and the State of the Teutonic Order, and with Warmia passed to the Lands of the Polish Crown according to the Second Peace of Thorn in 1466.

With the First Partition of Poland in 1772, Bischofsburg was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia and a year later incorporated into the newly established Province of East Prussia. The town's population was overwhelmingly Polish. According to the 1797 report of the local priest, of the 200 children attending religious education, only 20 were learning German. From 1862 until 1945, it was the seat of Landkreis R√∂√üel (Reszel district), from 1871 part of the German Empire. In 1882, in response to the Germanisation attempts of the authorities, a Polish library was established in the town. According to the 1897 data, 75% of children in the district, as well as in the whole southern Warmia region, spoke Polish. After the German defeat in World War I the 1920 East Prussian plebiscite held in the town resulted in 3461 against 52 votes cast for Germany. Bischofsburg was again 50% destroyed during the East Prussian Offensive of the Red Army in the late days of World War II. In 1945 the town was transferred, along with all of Warmia, to Poland according to the resolutions at the Potsdam Conference. Its remaining German population was expelled and the name changed to the historic . Despite its numerous devastations, the medieval city's layout has been largely preserved. The town's landmark is its 16th century Gothic Church dedicated to Saint John the Baptist (Ko≈õci√≥≈Ç p.w. ≈õw. Jana Chrzciciela), erected from 1505 onwards on the behest of Prince-Bishop Lucas Watzenrode and consecrated in 1580 by Prince-Bishop Marcin Kromer. Gallery Biskupiec, ul.

It is a historically working-class, predominantly residential neighbourhood, with a commercial strip located along Wellington Street West. It is home to the Parkdale Farmer's Market, located along Parkdale Avenue, just north of Wellington. Its eastern border is the O-Train Trillium Line, just west of Preston Street, with Centretown West / Somerset Heights neighbourhood to the east. To the north it is bounded by the transitway (originally the Canadian Pacific Railway main line), along Scott Street, with Mechanicsville beyond. To the south it is bounded by the Queensway (originally the Canadian National Railway main line) (417 Highway) and to the west by Holland Avenue (Hintonburg Community Association borders) or as far west as Island Park Drive. Using the community association's borders, the population of the neighbourhood is 7844 (2016 Census).Population calculated by combining Census Tract 5050043.00 with Dissemination areas 35060383, 35060384, 35060382, 35060390, 35060391, 35060396 Character Saint-Francois d'Assise Church on Wellington Hintonburg is very mixed in its character. The land use is mixed, and this is due to its predating land zoning rules. The area has a mix of heritage buildings and recent additions. In its April 2007 issue, enRoute magazine named Hintonburg one of the top ten emerging neighbourhoods in Canada. The same month, Ottawa Magazine said Hintonburg is \\"hot\\" and credits the QUAD arts district as the reason residents think we're \\"cool\\". Then in June 2007, the Financial Times noted that the 'Burg is \\"thriving again\\". =Description= The area to the north of Wellington Street is very mixed, and is becoming increasingly gentrified. Some industry still exists just south of Scott to the west of Parkdale and along Scott east of Parkdale. The north-east area is almost completely residential, composed primarily of one-hundred-year-old wood 'clapboard' homes, with a small village/enclave nature. Many of the homes are very small, being built by lumber workers in the late 1800s. The area had several lumber mills, 2 as recently as the 1990s - one along Hamilton Avenue and another along Breezehill, both of which were converted to townhouse developments. The area north of Wellington was once considered part of the \\"Mechanicsville\\" neighbourhood, not Hintonburg, but the expansion of the Transitway and Scott Street have cut off this section from the area to the north. The area to the south of Wellington is almost entirely residential of brick-veneer wood-frame construction dating to the 1910 to 1920s. There is very little commercial activity south of Wellington, except for some car repair shops along Gladstone, the Merry Dairy ice cream shop at the intersection of Fairmont and Gladstone Avenues, blumenstudio(a florist/cafe/newspaper shop) on Parkdale Avenue one block south of Gladstone, and along the O-Train Trillium Line to the east, where the Canadian Bank Note Company operates a large facility. There are also some industrial buildings along Breezehill and the Happy Goat Coffee Company, a roastery and cafe at the intersection of Laurel and Loretta North. To the west of Holland, in area known as Elmdale the basic pattern of land-use continues. To the south of Wellington, entirely residential. To the north, mainly residential, with smaller homes close to Scott reflecting the time when a railway ran nearby. The road known as Wellington ends here, and continues west as Richmond Road, at one time leading to the village of Richmond. Commercial activity along this street is predominantly independent businesses and offices. =Main streets= Businesses on Wellington are characterised by a mixture of largely proprietor-operated retail and service shops. In the east, Wellington has not completely recovered from its being bypassed in the 1960s. Several vacant and/or underutilized properties exist. To the west, Wellington is busier, and commercial activities are thriving due to the proximity of Tunney's Pasture and the Parkdale Market. Bars and restaurants have multiplied, especially along the stretch from Parkdale to Holland. The businesses along Wellington have grouped themselves under the banner of \\"Wellington West\\" to promote their businesses. Holland Avenue, a four-lane north-south avenue leading directly south of Tunney's Pasture, has developed a stretch of restaurants and commercial businesses to serve the government complex. At the corner of Holland and Wellington, the Irving Greenberg Theatre Centre was opened in 2007 for live theatre. Parkdale Avenue, a two-lane north-south avenue is a busy road. When the Queensway was built in the 1960s, Parkdale was chosen for an interchange rather than the four-lane Holland Avenue. This leads to daily traffic jams at \\"rush hour.\\" At its north end, some vestiges of the industrial area along the Scott Street rail line exist and are being converted into artists' space. The popular warm-weather Parkdale Market, a farmers' market, just north of Wellington is the home of about 20 stalls, of local and imported produce and flowers. To the south of Wellington, it is residential on both sides. Culture Hintonburg is home to the QUAD. The QUAD, an acronym that stands for Quartier des artistes / Arts District, blends cultural expression, community spirit and heritage character to create a special neighbourhood that embraces all arts disciplines, was established in 2003. Several galleries have opened since 2006 in the vicinity of the Parkdale Market. In 2005, the Hintonburg community Association (HCA) launched the ArtsPark annual event in the Parkdale Market featuring the works of Ottawa artists and musicians to highlight the community's growing role as an arts district in the city. Regular activities are put on at the Hintonburg Community Centre, including outdoor films in the summer. =Live theatre= Hintonburg is the long-time home of the Orpheus Musical Theatre Society, located on Fairmont Avenue. The Society produces several musical productions every year. The productions are mounted at the Centrepointe Theatre in Nepean. In 2007 the Great Canadian Theatre Company (GCTC) relocated to Hintonburg, in a new theatre built at Holland and Wellington. GCTC produces original Canadian plays. =Churches= Hintonburg features a few old churches. Including Saint- Fran√ßois d'Assise parish. It was established in 1890 by members of the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin, refugees from compulsory military service in France, with the construction of a church, school, and monastery (since demolished). In 1902, the buildings, together with an apple orchard, were enclosed by a stone wall the remnants of which today enclose Hintonburg Park. In 1913, the present larger gothic church was built to accommodate the growing parish, reflecting the strong Francophone character of Hintonburg at this time. Today this impressive edifice dominates the neighbourhood and its bells toll the Angelus at noon and 6:00 p.m., as well as a call to Mass (liturgy). History Originally part of Nepean Township the area was first settled in 1826, growing in size the village of Hintonburg was incorporated as a village in 1893. It was named after Joseph Hinton, a community leader who died in 1884. As the city of Ottawa grew it expanded west and Hintonburg was annexed to Ottawa in 1907. The Ahearne's Ottawa Street Railway Company ran a street car line through the area, continuing along further west along Byron Avenue (now a recreational path) and it soon became home to mostly blue collar workers who commuted into downtown. Hintonburg used to be on the main road leading west from downtown Ottawa. Wellington Street, which starts at Parliament Hill, runs through the center of the neighbourhood to this day. Originally, the area north of Wellington was considered Mechanicsville, but over time this has changed. When the NCC took over Lebreton Flats in the 1960s, the bridge over the north-south rail line linking the central Wellington street to the Hintonburg section was demolished, and the central Wellington street was linked to Scott street, making a bypass for the automobile traffic. This led to a decline in commercial business along Wellington Street which with gentrification has been reversed. At one time, there was a department store at the crossroads of Somerset and Wellington. By the 1970s it had become the main office of the used goods charity \\"Ottawa Neighbourhood Services\\" which had to move when it was bought out in 2001 and the buyer broke his verbal contract with ONS several months following the sale. The building was then converted to commercial use, with offices and a carpet store, but which have now houses an LCBO branch and a fabrications store. The 1950s and 1960s was a time of great change in the area. The federal government built the Tunney's Pasture office campus at the north end of Holland Avenue. The rail line along Scott Street was closed and eventually became the Transitway bus roadway. To the south, the Queensway/417 was built, partly on old rail lines, and partly directly through demolition of homes along its path. This provided another bypass around the area, and also lead to an increase of automobile traffic along Parkdale. When a major effort to remove prostitutes from the Byward Market area was made in the early 1990s, the strip along Wellington at Somerset became an area of \\"streetwalkers.\\" One notorious bar, named \\"Grads\\", located at Somerset and Bronson, burned down. It moved to Bayswater and Somerset, bringing its clientele, which used drugs. One incident outside its premises, where a man was beaten to death, led to its closure. By then the surrounding area had become known for its prostitutes, something which was only eradicated through regular crackdowns. The local Community Association worked with police and other city agencies to step up enforcement efforts against drug houses in an effort to reduce prostitution- and drug-related challenges. In one controversial development, residents had targeted \\"johns\\" by tracking and publishing partial licence plates. The Ottawa-Carleton Police set up a 'john school' whereby first-time offenders could attend instead of paying a fine and learn the effects of their trade. Community efforts were recognized with an award in 2009 for helping transform Hintonburg into a place with one of the lowest calls for police services in Ottawa. The area continues to change. In the late 1980s, the Hintonburg Community Association (HCA) was formed, and the local residents now have a better voice in community issues and local City of Ottawa activities. The Hintonburg Community/Recreation Centre was opened, and several in-fill developments have occurred. Several of the older industrial buildings and cottages have become space to artists. The area is adapting to a new role, that of central-area residential neighbourhood, and is comparable to others in Ottawa. In 2003, HCA published Hintonburg & Mechanicsville: A Narrative History by John Leaning, (); it is available in some local bookshops and through the association. A heritage walking tour of the neighbourhood is also available on their website (see link below). In 2005, the Parkdale Fire Station, built in 1923, was renovated into commercial space. It had served as a fire hall until 1986. It then housed a food bank and artists' studios. It was named a heritage building in 1996. It is one of only four pre-1945 fire stations left in Ottawa, 1 on Bruy√®re St. built in 1896, 1 on Arthur St. built in 1913. and another on Sunnyside Dr. built in 1921. Its renovation was one of the first and one of the last projects funded under federal heritage building restoration funds. =Notable events= * In 1896, the very first film projected in Canada using Thomas Edison's revolutionary Vitascope technique was part of a tent show in Hintonburg put on by the Holland Brothers. Transportation Hintonburg is accessible via the Pimisi station, Bayview station, and Tunney's Pasture station on the O-Train, and by the Route 11 and 14 buses, which runs along Wellington/Somerset and Gladstone for the neighbourhood's full length. The Parkdale exit provides car access from the Queensway. Wellington St is a busy bicycle corridor, and the city painted large so called 'sharrows' on the road as well as a dooring strip, where cyclists should not use that part of the road, to avoid being hit by vehicle doors being opened by drivers. Armstrong, one street north of Wellington, is a safer alternative.

It is used to prevent leakage of fluid, such as water or steam, between sliding or turning parts of machine elements. Components A stuffing box of a sailing boat will have a stern tube that is slightly bigger than the prop shaft. It will also have packing nut threads or a gland nut. The packing is inside the gland nut and creates the seal. The shaft is wrapped by the packing and put in the gland nut. Through tightening it onto the stern tube, the packing is compressed, creating a seal against the shaft.\\"Stuffing Box Maintenance\\", WindCheck Magazine, Retrieved April 27, 2016. Creating a proper plunger alignment is critical for correct flow and a long wear life. Stuffing box components are of stainless steel, brass or other application-specific materials.\\"Valve Components\\", Triangle-Pump, Retrieved April 27, 2016 Gland A gland is a general type of stuffing box, used to seal a rotating or reciprocating shaft against a fluid. The most common example is in the head of a tap (faucet) where the gland is usually packed with string which has been soaked in tallow or similar grease. The gland nut allows the packing material to be compressed to form a watertight seal and prevent water leaking up the shaft when the tap is turned on. The gland at the rotating shaft of a centrifugal pump may be packed in a similar way and graphite grease used to accommodate continuous operation. The linear seal around the piston rod of a double acting steam piston is also known as a gland, particularly in marine applications. Likewise the shaft of a handpump or wind pump is sealed with a gland where the shaft exits the borehole. Other types of sealed connections without moving parts are also sometimes called glands; for example, a cable gland or fitting that connects a flexible electrical conduit to an enclosure, machine or bulkhead facilitates assembly and prevents liquid or gas ingress. Applications =Boats= A small boat stuffing box comprising an adjusting nut, a locking nut and a sleeve On a boat having an inboard motor that turns a shaft attached to an external propeller, the shaft passes through a stuffing box, also called a \\"packing box\\"https://catalog.hydrasearchrecreational.com/category/packing-boxes-1 or \\"stern gland\\" in this application. The stuffing box prevents sea water from entering the boat's hull. In many small fiberglass boats, for example, the stuffing box is mounted inboard near the point the shaft exits the hull. The \\"box\\" is a cylindrical assembly, typically of bronze, comprising a sleeve threaded on one end to accept adjusting and locking nuts. A special purpose heavy-duty rubber hose attaches the stuffing box to a stern tube, also called a shaft log, that projects inward from the hull. Marine-duty hose clamps secure the hose to the stern tube and the aft portion of the stuffing box sleeve. A sound stuffing box installation is critical to safety because failure can admit a catastrophic volume of water into the boat. In a common type of stuffing box, rings of braided fiber, known as shaft packing or gland packing, form a seal between the shaft and the stuffing box. A traditional variety of shaft packing comprises a square cross-section rope made of flax or hemp impregnated with wax and lubricants. A turn of the adjusting nut compresses the shaft packing. Ideally, the compression is just enough to make the seal both watertight when the shaft is stationary and drip slightly when the shaft is turning. The drip rate must be at once sufficient to lubricate and cool the shaft and packing, but not so much as could sink an unattended boat. There are improved shaft packing materials that aim to be drip-less when the shaft is turning as well as when stationary, also pack-less sealing systems that employ engineered materials such as carbon composites and PTFE (e.g. Teflon). =Steam engines= A rod coming out of a stuffing box on a steam engine In a steam engine, where the piston rod reciprocates through the cylinder cover, a stuffing box provided in the cylinder cover prevents the leakage of steam from the cylinder.

(It continues to increase very slowly with the field due to paramagnetism.) Saturation is a characteristic of ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic materials, such as iron, nickel, cobalt and their alloys. Different ferromagnetic materials have different saturation levels. Description Saturation is most clearly seen in the magnetization curve (also called BH curve or hysteresis curve) of a substance, as a bending to the right of the curve (see graph at right). As the H field increases, the B field approaches a maximum value asymptotically, the saturation level for the substance. Technically, above saturation, the B field continues increasing, but at the paramagnetic rate, which is several orders of magnitude smaller than the ferromagnetic rate seen below saturation. The relation between the magnetizing field H and the magnetic field B can also be expressed as the magnetic permeability: \\\\mu = B / H or the relative permeability \\\\mu_r = \\\\mu/\\\\mu_0, where \\\\mu_0 is the vacuum permeability. The permeability of ferromagnetic materials is not constant, but depends on H. In saturable materials the relative permeability increases with H to a maximum, then as it approaches saturation inverts and decreases toward one. Different materials have different saturation levels. For example, high permeability iron alloys used in transformers reach magnetic saturation at 1.6‚Äì2.2teslas (T), whereas ferrites saturate at 0.2‚Äì0.5T. Some amorphous alloys saturate at 1.2‚Äì1.3T. Mu-metal saturates at around 0.8T. Due to saturation, the magnetic permeability Œºf of a ferromagnetic substance reaches a maximum and then declines Explanation Ferromagnetic materials (like iron) are composed of microscopic regions called magnetic domains, that act like tiny permanent magnets that can change their direction of magnetization. Before an external magnetic field is applied to the material, the domains' magnetic fields are oriented in random directions, effectively cancelling each other out, so the net external magnetic field is negligibly small. When an external magnetizing field H is applied to the material, it penetrates the material and aligns the domains, causing their tiny magnetic fields to turn and align parallel to the external field, adding together to create a large magnetic field B which extends out from the material. This is called magnetization. The stronger the external magnetic field H, the more the domains align, yielding a higher magnetic flux density B. Eventually, at a certain external magnetic field, the domain walls have moved as far as they can, and the domains are as aligned as the crystal structure allows them to be, so there is negligible change in the domain structure on increasing the external magnetic field above this. The magnetization remains nearly constant, and is said to have saturated. The domain structure at saturation depends on the temperature. Effects and uses Saturation puts a practical limit on the maximum magnetic fields achievable in ferromagnetic-core electromagnets and transformers of around 2 T, which puts a limit on the minimum size of their cores. This is one reason why high power motors, generators, and utility transformers are physically large; to conduct the large amounts of magnetic flux necessary for high power production, they must have large magnetic cores. In applications in which the weight of magnetic cores must be kept to a minimum, such as transformers and electric motors in aircraft, a high saturation alloy such as Permendur is often used. In electronic circuits, transformers and inductors with ferromagnetic cores operate nonlinearly when the current through them is large enough to drive their core materials into saturation. This means that their inductance and other properties vary with changes in drive current. In linear circuits this is usually considered an unwanted departure from ideal behavior. When AC signals are applied, this nonlinearity can cause the generation of harmonics and intermodulation distortion. To prevent this, the level of signals applied to iron core inductors must be limited so they don't saturate. To lower its effects, an air gap is created in some kinds of transformer cores. The saturation current, the current through the winding required to saturate the magnetic core, is given by manufacturers in the specifications for many inductors and transformers. On the other hand, saturation is exploited in some electronic devices. Saturation is employed to limit current in saturable-core transformers, used in arc welding, and ferroresonant transformers which serve as voltage regulators. When the primary current exceeds a certain value, the core is pushed into its saturation region, limiting further increases in secondary current. In a more sophisticated application, saturable core inductors and magnetic amplifiers use a DC current through a separate winding to control an inductor's impedance. Varying the current in the control winding moves the operating point up and down on the saturation curve, controlling the alternating current through the inductor. These are used in variable fluorescent light ballasts, and power control systems. Saturation is also exploited in fluxgate magnetometers and fluxgate compasses. In some audio applications, saturable transformers or inductors are deliberately used to introduce distortion into an audio signal. Magnetic saturation generates odd-order harmonics, typically introducing third and fifth harmonic distortion to the lower and mid frequency range.

The school opened to 36 students in September 1986 and has approximately 750 students at present and about 50 staff members. The school is situated at the end of the River Forest Estate. It is one of two secondary-level schools in Leixlip, the other being Col√°iste Chiar√°in.  History  Before the construction of the original school building in Riverforest in 1994, Confey College teachers taught in nearby Scoil San Carlo on a part-time basis after the primary school closed for the day at 3 pm. After lobbying from teachers and parents, prefabricated buildings were provided on the site which the school currently occupies. With the growth of Leixlip and an expanding teenage population, these facilities were inadequate. With much further teacher and local pressure, what is now the older of the two school buildings was built in 1994, with three prefabs remaining in use as classrooms. The remaining prefabs were removed in 2001 with the construction of a new, larger building. In February 2011, Mary McAleese made a presidential visit to the school in honour of its 25-year anniversary.  Musical productions  The school produces annual musical productions. Past shows include Jack and the Beanstalk, Sleeping Beauty, Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat, Grease, Back to the 80's, Sinbad, Cinderella and Treasure Island. The musical productions were halted in 2014 and instead replaced by a talent competition named 'Show Stoppers!'. But in 2015 the TY group put on a musical Little Shop Of Horrors. The Transition Year group of 2016-17 displayed the musical Hairspray'd. In December 2018, the Transition Year group of 2018-19 performed the musical FAME JR. The transition year group of 2019-2020 performed the musical All Shook Up from 11-13 December 2019.  Green-Schools  Confey College has a Green-Schools committee made up of students and teachers. The committee started in 2009 and has conducted surveys, worked with a local Councillor on cleanup days and has plans to make a garden to mark the school's 25th birthday. The school was awarded its first green flag in 2013 and its second flag in 2014. The committee is currently working on gaining the school's third flag. Sport Confey College have an all-weather 'astro turf' pitch. The pitches are used for school teams as well as PE. In hurling, Confey College secured the Senior Leinster 'C1' Championship in 2010, defeating St. Vincent's C.B.S. 3-11 to 0‚Äì2. In 2010, Confey College's futsal team won the Kildare & Leinster Post Primary Schools Futsal title. They defeated St. Peter's College of Dunboyne 1‚Äì0 in the final.

Its historical leaders were Presidents Nur Muhammad Taraki and Hafizullah Amin. It was also the name of the leftist newspaper produced by the same movement. It was supported by the USSR and was formed in 1965 when the PDPA was born. The Khalqist wing of the party was made up primarily of Pashtuns from non-elite classes. However, their Marxism was often a vehicle for tribal resentments. Bitter resentment between the Khalq and Parcham factions eventually led to the failure of the government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan that was formed as a result of the Saur Revolution in 1978. It was also responsible for the radical reforms and brutal dissident crackdowns that encouraged the rebellion of the religious segments present in the Afghan society, which led to the creation of the Mujahideen and, eventually, to the Soviet military intervention in December 1979. Early political history The People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan held its First Congress on January 1, 1965. Twenty-seven men gathered at Nur Mohammed Taraki's house in Kabul, elected Taraki PDPA Secretary General, Babrak Karmal as Deputy Secretary General, and chose a five-member Central Committee(or Politburo). Finally, Hafizullah Amin was the only Khalqi member of the PDPA to be elected to Parliament in 1969. =Khalq ‚Äì Parcham division of the PDPA= The party was weakened by bitter, and sometimes violent, internal rivalries. The Khalq faction was more tribal, whereas the Parcham had more support among the urban population and middle classes. Especially on the ideological level, Karmal and Taraki differed in their perceptions of Afghanistan's revolutionary potential: * Taraki believed that revolution could be achieved in the classical Leninist fashion by building a tightly disciplined working-class party. * Karmal felt that Afghanistan was too undeveloped for a Leninist strategy and that a national democratic front of patriotic and anti- imperialist forces had to be fostered in order to bring the country a step closer to socialist revolution. The newspaper was highly successful, especially among students. Its first edition sold 20,000 copies, and later editions numbered around 10,000 (there were only six editions altogether). On May 23, 1966, the authorities closed Khalq on the grounds that it was anti- Islamic, anticonstitutional, and antimonarchical. Karmal's faction founded Parcham, a weekly magazine that he published between March 1968 and July 1969. Parcham was shut down in June 1969 on the eve of parliamentary elections. =The Republican Revolution of 1973= Khalq was excluded from the new government because of its lack of good political connections and its go-it- alone policy on noncooperation. Taraki did advocate a united front briefly after former Prime Minister Mohammad Daoud Khan's takeover in an attempt to gain places in the government for his followers, but this effort was unsuccessful. The Khalqis claimed to be more leftist and more independent of the Soviet Union than Parcham, but their base of support was not strong among the masses, and much stronger in the military. Because of this, Khalq abandoned his party's traditional emphasis on working-class recruitment and sought to build his own power base within the officer corps. Khalq's influence at Kabul University was also limited. In 1973 the Khalq faction energetically began to encourage military personnel to join them. Taraki had been in charge of Khalq activity in the military. In 1973 he passed his recruitment duties to Amin. This move was highly successful: by the time of the communist coup, in April 1978, Khalq outnumbered Parcham by a factor of two or three to one. The Moscow-sponsored union of Parcham and Khalq may have been in preparation for his peaceful passage from the scene in the near future. The merger of Parcham and Khalq rapidly became unglued. However, Mir Akbar Khyber, a prominent leftist, was killed by the government and his associates. Although the government issued a statement deploring the assassination, the PDPA leaders feared that Daoud was planning to exterminate them all. In this way, both Khalq and Parcham forgot their internal rivalries and worked to overthrow the government. On the eve of the communist coup, Hafizullah Amin was the only member of the Central Committee that was not arrested. The police did not send him to immediate imprisonment, as it did with Politburo members of the PDPA on April 25, 1978. He was the last person to be arrested, his imprisonment was postponed for five hours, during which time Amin, without having the authority and while the Politburo members were in prison, instructed the Khalqi army officers to overthrow the government. The Khalqist Army cells prepared for a massive uprising. On April 27 the Khalqist military leaders began the revolution by proclaiming to the cells in the armed forces that the time for revolution had arrived. Khalqist Colonel Mohammad Aslam Watanjar was the Army commander on the ground during the Coup, and his troops gained control of Kabul. Colonel Abdul Qadir, the leader of the Air Force squadrons, also launched a major attack on the Royal Palace, in the course of which President Mohammad Daoud Khan and most of his family, including women and children, were assassinated. The Saur Revolution (April 1978 ‚Äì April 1992) The flag of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, in use from October 1978 until April 1980 (after Khalq's ousting from government). The Saur Revolution, as the new government labeled its coup d'√©tat (after the month in the Persian calendar in which it occurred), was almost entirely the achievement of the Khalq faction of the PDPA. Khalq's victory was partially due to Daoud's miscalculation that Parcham was the more serious threat. This success gave it effective control over the armed forces, a great advantage over its Parchami rival. During the first months of the revolution, Cabinet membership was split eleven to ten, with Khalq in the majority. =Khalq as Government (April 1978 ‚Äì December 1979)= However, the initial, moderate, approach to Islam taken by the PDPA was quickly abandoned as the Khalqists sought to consolidate their hold on power. Khalq dominated the Revolutionary Council, which was to serve as the ruling body of the government. The Khalq leadership ran the country by issuing a series of eight edicts. They suspended all laws except those on civil matters. Another exception was the criminal law of the Daoud period, retained as a repressive instrument. They also embarked on a campaign of radical land reform accompanied by mass repression in the countryside that resulted in the arrest and summary execution of tens of thousands. The Khalqi policy of encouraging the education of girls, for example, aroused deep resentment in the villages. By putting Afghanistan on the revolutionary road, the Khalq wing of the PDPA stirred the countryside into revolt. President Nur Mohammad Taraki refused to tolerate any Parchamis in the military and insisted that all officers affiliate with Khalq. By June 1978 an estimated 800 Parchami military personnel were forced to quit the armed forces. Shortly after, the Khalqist wing in the Army, initiated a purge of Parchamis. They accomplished this performing the elimination of the opposition and removal of any restraints posed by the Parchamis. Hafizullah Amin took over as prime minister in March 1979, retaining the position of field marshal and becoming vice-president of the Supreme Defence Council. Taraki remained President and in control of the Army, though now he reportedly devoted a lot of his time at the Royal Palace, which had been renamed the People's Palace. Events also tended to sub-divide the protagonists. The intense rivalry between Taraki and Amin within the Khalq faction heated up. In September 1979, Taraki's followers, with Soviet complicity, had made several attempts on Amin's life. The final attempt backfired. Amin's murder of Taraki divided the Khalqis. Rival military cliques divided the Khalqis further. In late October, Amin made a military sweep against the insurgents, victoriously driving 40,000 people ‚Äì mostly non- combatants ‚Äì across the border into Pakistan. At the end of 1979 there were 400,000 Afghan refugees, mostly in Pakistan. The USSR attempted to temper the Khalqis' radicalism, urging attendance at mosques, inclusion of Parchamis and non-communists in the government, and a halt to the unpopular land reform movement. Most of this advice was ignored. The last Khalq President, Hafizullah Amin, was assassinated after Soviet intelligence forces took control of the government and installed Babrak Karmal, a Parchami, in his place. =The Parcham Government and Soviet invasion (December 1979 ‚Äì April 1989)= Khalqi-Parchami differences began to rend the military as Khalqi leaders, fearful that the Parchamis retained their cellular organization within the military, mounted massive purges of Parchamis. Thanks to Amin's efforts in the 1970s, the officer corps consisted largely of Khalqis. The Army was also not immune to antigovernment sentiment. Soldiers began to desert and mutiny. Herat was the site of an uprising in March 1979 in which a portion of the town's military garrison joined. The rebels butchered Soviet citizens as well as Khalqis. The purging of Parchamis had left the military forces so dominated by Khalqis that the Soviets had no choice but to rely upon Khalqi officers to rebuild the army. Khalq officers and men expressed bitterness over the preferential treatment given their Parcham rivals by the Parcham dominated regime. Disaffected Khalqis often assisted the Mujahideen. Khalqis in the armed forces often accused their Parchami officers of using them as cannon fodder and complained that young Parchami men were exempted from compulsory military service. A show of this was that, in 1980, at the April military parade celebrating the Saur Revolution, many Tank Corps continued to display the Red Flag of Khalq, instead of the new national flag adopted by Babrak Karmal. PDPA-Khalq (1989‚Äìpresent) =Najibullah Administration (1986‚Äì1992)= After the 40th Soviet Army left the country, President Najibullah suffered, to a lesser degree, the same disadvantage that Karmal had when he was installed as General Secretary of the PDPA by the Soviets. This fact was shown by the fierceness of the resistance to Najibullah's appointment within the Parcham faction. This split persisted, forcing President Najibullah to straddle his politics between whatever Parchami support he could maintain and alliances he could win from the Khalqists. In December 1989, 127 Khalqist military officers were arrested for an attempted coup. Twenty-seven officers escaped and later showed up at a press conference with Gulbuddin Hekmatyar in Peshawar. Former Minister of Tribal Affairs, Bacha Gul Wafadar and Minister of Civil Aviation Hasan Sharq were among the conspirators. In March 1990, once again the Mujahideen leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar cooperated in a coup attempt, this time led by the Khalqist Defense minister Shahnawaz Tanai. Tanai was apparently also supported by those important Khalqist who remained in the Politburo, Assadullah Sarwary and Mohammad Gulabzoi, respectively their country's envoys to Aden and Moscow. They were said to have been intimately connected with the coup and with Gen. Tanai. However, Tanai had no direct control of troops inside Kabul. The plot misfired and failed because of faulty communications. =Afghan Civil War (1992‚Äì2001)= At the end, however, the former Khalqists either joined or allied themselves with the Taliban or other Mujahideen warlords after the collapse of President Najibullah's Government in April, 1992. A perfect example of this was that, once Kabul was captured, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar gained the support of some Khalqi (and mostly Pashto) hardliners, including the Minister of Internal Affairs Raz Mohammad Paktin and then Defence Minister Mohammad Aslam Watanjar. Another example of this is the fact that Gen. Tanai has (according to western diplomatic sources) acted as an agent for ISI by providing the Taliban a skilled cadre of military officers. In this way, the Khalqi faction were once again involved in the war, using his pilots to fly the Mig-23 and Sukhoi fighters of what was left of the Afghan Air Force, driving Soviet Tanks and using Soviet Artillery. With no central government and fighting for different groups, Khalq was merely a pawn in the Afghan Civil War between the Afghan Northern Alliance and the Taliban. =Karzai Administration (2002‚Äìpresent)= Other Khalqists have developed fairly close relations with the current regime, after the defeat of the Taliban and the ascendance of Hamid Karzai in 2002. * General Babrak Shinwari, former head of the youth affairs section of the PDPA under Taraki and Amin, who migrated to Peshawar in Pakistan in the winter of 1992. He later helped found the Afghanistan-Pakistan People Friendship Society and was elected member of the Loya Jirga by a council of elders from Nazyan Shinwari area of Nangarhar province. * Another former Khalqist general who has enjoyed the protection of powerful politicians in the current Afghan government is the former PDPA governor of Kandahar, Nur al-Haq Olumi, who enjoys the patronage of Marshal Mohammad Qasim Fahim. * The National Unity Party (Motahed-e Melli Hezb) was established in 2003. In this way, the Khalqi faction of the Homeland Party is once again attempting to participate in Afghan politics. It is now led by former Khalqist General Noorul Haq Uloomi.

Pagter, When You're Up to Your Ass in Alligators: More Urban Folklore from the Paperwork Empire (Wayne State University Press, 1987), , pp.61-62. or similar title) started as an informal \\"drinking club\\" between World War II pilots, self-described as \\"an honorable drinking fraternity composed of ladies and gentlemen of the highest morals and good character, who are never vulgar.\\"  History of the Order  According to Denis P. McGowan of the \\"Ancient and Honorable Order of Turtles\\", his father, the late Captain Hugh P. McGowan, U.S. Army Air Corps/U.S. Air Force Reserve (Ret.) and several pilots of the U.S. Army Air Corps 8th Air Force founded the Ancient and Honorable Order of Turtles in an officers' club while stationed in England during the Second World War: \\"We were flying daytime bombing missions over Hitler's Third Reich. We just wanted a little fun. We had seen a sign showing that the 'Ancient Order of Foresters' and the 'Royal Antediluvian Order of Buffaloes' would meet in the local pub, so I devised the name 'Ancient and Honorable Order of Turtles' for the fun of it. It was not meant to be serious, it had no constitution or by-laws, and was a relief from the horrors and dangers we saw every day on our missions. It spread after the War through the VFW and American Legion posts, and eventually, to Masonic groups, colleges and even to the high schools of the U.S.A.\\"  Qualifying questions  To gain admission, one must correctly answer a number (usually three or four) from a list of questions, each of which suggests a vulgar, lewd, or salacious answer, but the actual correct answer is rather innocuous. It is assumed that all prospective Turtles own a diabetic donkey, or one of a sweet and kindly disposition; therefore once inducted, a member must reply to the question \\"Are you a Turtle?\\" with \\"You bet your sweet ass I am.\\"Wally Schirra & Richard N. Billings, Schirra's Space (Naval Institute Press, 1995), , pp. 91-92 (excerpt available at Google Books). If the member is unable or unwilling (perhaps because of a social restriction on vulgarity) to provide the correct answer, he or she owes to each other turtle present a drink of the recipient's choice. A large part of the tradition of the order involves the qualifying questions that prospective members have to answer. These fun questions are actually small riddles: each suggests a vulgar or lewd answer, but the candidate has to provide a completely innocuous answer. A popular example would be the question: The obvious answer to this question would be \\"pee\\" or \\"urinate\\", but the correct answer is \\"shake hands\\" (as western etiquette demands that a man needs to rise from his seat to shake hands, while a woman needs not). * What does a cow have four of and a woman only two? * What is a four letter word ending in K that means to have intercourse? * What is it on a man that is round and hard, and sticks so far out of his pajamas that you can hang a hat on it? A candidate must answer four from a list of twenty-five of such questions.Ben Evans, Escaping the Bonds of Earth: The Fifties and the Sixties (Springer Publishing, 2009), , pp. 157-158, 164, 448. Excerpts available at Google Books. While there is a traditional set of questions, some modern clubs also make up new initiation questions along the same lines.  Historical references  During the 1962 Mercury-Atlas 8 mission (part of the United States space program), astronaut Wally Schirra was asked by a ground controller whether he was a turtle. Not wanting to use vulgar language while his communications were being broadcast worldwide, he temporarily stopped transmitting while he gave the required response \\"YBYSAIA\\". Deke Slayton, a mere three minutes into Sigma 7s flight, came on the radio, which was open for everyone to hear, and asked, \\"Hey, Wally, are you a turtle?\\" Schirra switched his mic from live to record and uttered the appropriate response. On the open line, he said, \\"Rog.\\"Mercury MA-8, Encyclopedia Astronautica Later, on board the recovery ship , in front of Slayton, Walt Williams and the other astronauts, Walt Williams demanded to know how Schirra replied to Deke's question. Schirra played the recorder. \\"Hey, Wally, are you a turtle?\\" followed by the proper response, \\"YBYSAIA\\". This incident is also recounted in Tom Wolfe's 1979 book The Right Stuff.Tom Wolfe, The Right Stuff (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1979; reprint, Macmillan Publishers, 2008), , p.308 (excerpt available at Google Books). Wally Schirra's membership in the Ancient Order of Turtles came up again during Apollo 7, which was captured by the in- flight recorder: :CAPCOM radioed, \\"Just a minute, Wally. Let's see. Oh, it's a little message to Deke Slayton. A little bit closer Wally. Kind of looks like something about - 'Are you a, are you a‚Äî\\" Schirra acknowledged, \\"That's right.\\" CAPCOM continued, \\"Looks like it says, 'Are you a turtle, Deke Slayton?\\" :Schirra confirmed, \\"That's right.\\" Eisele added, \\"You get an A for reading today Jack.\\" Swigert continued, \\"Here comes another one. Walt, oh, that-a-way, that's the way to turn it. It says, 'Paul Haney, are you a turtle?'\\" Cunningham radioed, \\"You'll get a gold star. Perfect score!\\" Swigert reported, \\"And there is no reply from Paul Haney there.\\" Cunningham asked, \\"You mean he's speechless?\\" :A short while later, CAPCOM Cernan informed Schirra, \\"Wally, this is Gene. Deke just called in, and we've got your answer, and we've got it recorded for you return.\\" Schirra acknowledged, \\"Roger. Real fine.\\" :Shortly thereafter, Schirra asked CAPCOM Swigert, \\"Have you got Haney's answer yet?\\" Swigert replied, \\"No, Haney's isn't talking, Wally.\\" Swigert then added, \\"Somebody tells me he isn't talking, but just buying.\\" A pleased Schirra responded, \\"He is buying. Thank you very much. Very good.\\" :This exchange about turtles was a reference to the notorious Turtle's Club drinking club of which Wally Schirra held the title of a Grand Potentate. During Schirra's Mercury flight Deke Slayton had radioed up to Schirra asking Schirra if he was a turtle.Apollo 7 Mission Log, Earth to the Moon :A membership card for the \\"Interstellar Association of Turtles (Outer Shell Division)\\" signed by astronauts Scott Carpenter, Gordon Cooper and Wally Schirra sold at auction for $1,952 on May 5, 2011.

When the beeswax from brood comb is rendered to produce clean wax, it leaves behind the pupa casings, skins shed by molting larvae, excrement from larvae, wax moth cocoons, and other residual debris included in the original material. Less slumgum can be expected from rendering of cappings or honey comb. Slumgum is slightly heavier than wax and sticks to the bottom of the wax cake. It is brown to black in color, and burns readily. Melted slumgum can be poured over pine cones to make fire starters. Lumps of slumgum are very attractive to bees, especially when heated by the sun. They can be used to attract bee swarms, and some people therefore prefer applying melted slumgum on the sides of supers. Slumgum is also used as a fertilizer in some agricultural crops like ornamentals; it has been shown that slumgum contains several nutrients that are required for the growth of these crops. Depending on how well the rendering was performed, slumgum may still contain significant amount of wax that is possible to extract in larger factories using more complex equipment.

The two shrines, an upper and a lower, lie in a corner of the old capital which was known as the due to traditional geomancy beliefs that the north-east corner brought misfortune.

The formal names of corollary jinja memorialize vital roots in a history which pre-dates the founding of Japan's ancient capital. Although now incorporated within boundaries of the city, the Tadasu no Mori location was a site planning factor.Terry, Philip. (1914). Terry's Japanese empire, p. 479. It is theorized that this forest was the primeval forest home of the sacerdotal Kamo clan, who were the exclusive caretakers of the shrine from prehistoric times.Nelson, pp. 67-69. The boundaries of today's smaller forest encompasses approximately 12.4 hectares, which are preserved as a national historical site („ÇíÂõΩ„ÅÆÂè≤Ë∑°). The woods of this sacred grove are designated by UNESCO as a World Cultural Heritage site along with other Shinto shrines in its environs.Shimogamo-jinja: \\"Tadasu- no-mori (Forest of justice)\\" This pathway leads through Tadasu no Mori (the \\"Forest Where Lies are Revealed\\"). The shrine's annual festival, Kamo no Matsuri, also called Aoi Matsuri, is the oldest of Kyoto's three major festivals. The others are Jidai Matsuri and Gion Matsuri. Shinto belief The popular name for Kamo-wakeikazuchi jinja is the Kamigamo jinja or Kamigamo Shrine, also called Upper Shrine. In part, it is called the \\"upper\\" shrine because it is situated on the east bank of the up-stream from its non- identical twin.Shively, Donald H. (1999). The Cambridge History of Japan: Heian Japan, p. 181. The more commonly used name for Kamo-mioya jinja is the Shimogamo jinja or Shimogamo Shrine, also called the Lower Shrine. In part, it is called the \\"lower\\" shrine because it is situated at the confluence of the and the Kamo River down-stream from its twin. The Kamo Shrine is so named because its rituals and festivals are designed to assist in the veneration of the Kamo family of kami and other associated deities; and Kamo kami (kami-no- Kamo) is referenced in other Shinto contexts. In the \\"Congratulatory Words of the Chieftain of Izumo,\\" the \\"sacred grove of Kamo\\" is mentioned along with other wooded Shinto sanctuaries at ≈å-miwa, Unade and Asuka: ::Then, ≈å-namochi- no-mikoto said: ::\\"The Sovereign GrandhildHere the term \\"Sovereign Grandchild\\" refers to the Emperor of Japan. will dwell peacefully in the land of Yamato.\\" ::Thus saying, he attached his peaceful spirit ::To a mirror of large dimensions, ::Eulogizing it by the name ::Yamato-no-≈å-mono-nushi-Kushi-mika- tama-no-mikoto, ::And had it dwell in the sacred grove of ≈å-miwa. ::He caused the spirit of his son ::Aji-suki-taka-hiko-ne-no-mikoto ::To dwell in the sacred grove of Kamo in Kaduraki;Mt. Kaduraki -- see Ashkenazi, Michael. (2003). Handbook of Japanese mythology, p. 166. ::Caused the spirit of Koto- shiro-nushi-no-mikoto ::To dwell in Unade; ::And caused the spirit of Kayanarumi-no-mikoto ::To dwell in the sacred grove of Asuka.de Bary, Theodore et al. (2001). Sources of Japanese Tradition, p. 39, citing Philippi, Donald L. Norito, pp. 73-74. At the Kamigamo Shrine, Kamo Wake-ikazuchi, the kami of thunder, is the focus of attention and reverence.Ponsonby-Fane, Richard. (1964). Visiting Famous Shrines in Japan, pp. 119-175. Shimogamo Shrine is dedicated to the veneration of Kamo Wake-ikazuchi's mother, Kamo Tamayori- hime. Shimogamo is also dedicated to Kamo Taketsune, who is the father of Kamo Taayori-hime.Ponsonby-Fane, Visiting Shrines, pp. 1-118. All feature prominently in the annual Aoi Festival, which occurs in May. Featured in this event are a procession between the two shrines, horse races, and demonstrations of mounted archery (yabusame). Kamigamo Shrine's two large conical sand mounds memorialize the holy trees that once served to welcome spirits. Shimogama Shrine has since become one of the key shrines in the area, being associated with prayers to ensure the success of the annual rice harvest. The Shrine is located within Tadasu no Mori (Á≥∫„ÅÆÊ£Æ), 'the forest of truth,' a primeval forest that is reputed to have never been burned down. The forest has, in fact, suffered some damage over the centuries when all of Kyoto was burned during successive revolts and wars; but the forest growth has rebounded again and again. Tadasu no mori is left to grow in its natural state. It is neither planted nor pruned. Although Kamigamo and Shimogamo shrines are considered to be paired or twinned, they are not located next to each other. Approximately 2 km. distance separates these two Shinto shrine complexes, which can be explained in part because shrines on the outskirts of Heian-ky≈ç were developed to prevent the infiltration of demons. The Kamogawa river descnds from an ill-omened direction; and the shrines along the flow were positioned in order to prevent demons from using the river to enter the city.Miyazaki, \\"Defending Heiankyo.\\" Although Kamo-jinja is not directly on the banks of the Kamo River, the site locations were positioned as part of a plan for mitigating the consequences of periodic flooding.Katsuya Atsuo. \\"Historical Study on Kamo-Wakeikazuchi Shrine and Myojin River in the Kamigamo Area.\\" Bulletin of the Institute for National Land Utilization Development (Kyoto Sangyo University), No. 21, pp. 13-31 (2000). History Sazare-Ishi (conglomerate rock) alludes to pebbles which are said to grow into boulders as described in the lyrics of Kimi ga Yo.Guichard-Anguis, Sylvie et al. (2009). The shrine became the object of Imperial patronage during the early Heian period.Breen, John et al. (2000). Shinto in History: Ways of the Kami, pp. 74-75. In 965, Emperor Murakami ordered that Imperial messengers were sent to report important events to Japan's guardian kami, including those venerated at the Kamo Shrine. These heihaku were initially presented to 16 shrines.Ponsonby-Fane. Studies, pp. 116-117. The lower shrine is that of a kami mother; and the upper shrine is that of her kami offspring. The head priests of both have the same title, Kamo-no-Agata-no Nushi.Wheeler, Post. (1976). The sacred scriptures of the Japanese, p. 482. In agata-no-nushi titles, the appended noun is typically a place name; but in a Taih≈ç ritsury≈ç consolidation, the Kamo mirror the Yamato clan's amalgamating conventions in merging the area, its name, its sacred centers and its kami within a single nominative identifier.Nelson, p. 95. =Kamigamo Shrine= Tatesuna are a pair of standing cones of sand in front of Sai-Den at Kamigamo-jinja. They are traditionally construed as allusions to a pair of sacred mountains.JapanVisitor: Kamigamo From 1871 through 1946, the Kamigamo Shrine was officially designated one of the , meaning that it stood in the first rank of government supported shrines.Ponsonby-Fane, Richard. (1959). The Imperial House of Japan, pp. 124. It is famous for its haiden (worship hall), rebuilt in 1628-1629 (Kan'ei 6). A number of priests' residences are situated on its grounds, and one, the Nishimura House, is open to the public. =Shimogamo Shrine= The Shimogamo Shrine was officially designated Kanpei-taisha in 1871. Shimogamo Shrine is believed to be 100 years older than Kamigamo Shrine, dating back to the 6th century. A shrine structure was erected in 678 during the reign of the Emperor Tenmu, and this became the principal building during the reign or of the Emperor Kanmu when he transferred the capital from Heij≈ç- ky≈ç, and Nagaoka-ky≈ç to Heian-ky≈ç.GoJapanGo: Shimgamo Shrine =Imperial progresses to the shrines= *January 16, 795 (Enryaku 13, 21st day of the 12th month): Emperor Kanmu made an Imperial progress to both Kamo shrines.Ponsonby-Fane, Richard.

He was the editor of the biweekly the eXile in Moscow, from its founding in 1997 until its closure in 2008. Ames has also written for the New York Press, PandoDaily, The Nation, Playboy, The San Jose Mercury News, Alternet, –ü—Ç—é—á Connection, GQ (Russian edition), and is the author of three books. He co- hosts the podcast Radio War Nerd along with John Dolan.https://www.patreon.com/radiowarnerd Biography Ames was raised in Saratoga, California, where he attended an Episcopalian private school. He graduated from Saratoga High School in 1983. He later wrote about a 2003 alleged bombing attempt at his alma mater in Going Postal‚ÄîRage, Murder and Rebellion: From Reagan's Workplaces to Clinton's Columbine and Beyond. After leaving Saratoga, Ames attended the University of California, Berkeley, while living with his father (his parents divorced when Ames was eight years old). He later described how his college years shaped his later political views in a section of the book The Exile: Sex, Drugs, and Libel in the New Russia: After college, Ames lived in New York City, Boston, San Francisco, and Prague, and played briefly in a punk band. He also tried writing screenplays. In August 1991, he visited Europe, spending two weeks in St. Petersburg (at that time called Leningrad). Though he returned to live in Foster City, California, he continued thinking of Russia, and delved into Russian literature. After spending mid-1992 to early 1993 in Prague, Ames moved to Moscow. In 1995, he published \\"The Rise and Fall of Moscow's Expat 'Royalty'\\" in the English- language Moscow newspaper The Moscow Times, and was shortly thereafter hired by its competitor Living Here.http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/1995/10/04/032.html In 1997, he established the eXile, where he served as writer and editor, and shortly after founded it, he hired Matt Taibbi. In The eXile, Ames wrote on politics, organized crime in Russia, prostitution, and drug use. The paper played practical jokes on Pravda staffers and public figures including Mikhail Gorbachev. In 2000 Ames and Taibbi published The Exile: Sex, Drugs, and Libel in the New Russia. Chicago Reader contributor Martha Bayne reviewed the book, and wrote: \\"The product of Ames and Taibbi's union is rude, cruel, pornographic, self-aggrandizing, infantile, and breathtakingly misogynist, with a dozen pages of news and another dozen of gonzo entertainment listings. It's also one of the biggest success stories of the tiny, incestuous world of expatriate Moscow. Pranks are sharper--and meaner--than others, but they're all conceived under a towering belief in the righteousness of the paper's mission. The Exile has kept up a holy racket, railing away against stupidity, corruption, and influence peddling . . . It has covered mind-numbingly complex topics like privatization in a straightforward style that's not only comprehensible but actually interesting to a reader with no background in Russian economic history and little enthusiasm for acquiring one.\\" Ames spoke about his sex life in Moscow during an interview with The New York Observer in 2000: \\"'Russian women, especially on the first date, expect you to rape them,' said Mr. Ames. 'They‚Äôll go back home with you and say, ‚ÄòNo, no, no,‚Äô and if you‚Äôre an American, you‚Äôve been trained to respect the ‚ÄòNo,‚Äô because you‚Äôre afraid of sexual harassment or date rape, and so you fail over and over. But it took me a while to learn you really have to force Russian girls, and that‚Äôs what they want, it‚Äôs like a mock rape.\\" In June 2008, the eXile website was closed down by the Russian government and Ames returned to the U.S. Ames continues to edit the eXile in an online-only format: eXiledonline.The Exiled: We're Back, and We're Very Pissed Off The eXile Retrieved on November 27, 2009 Ames became senior editor at Paul Carr's Not Safe For Work Corporation website in August 2012.https://www.nsfwcorp.com/dispatch/taking-ames/ In October 2017, in the context of the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations and a new book release by Taibbi, passages from the book were highlighted in the media.

It is the longest suspension bridge in Brazil. The central span was considered quite long (but not the longest, at 340 metres) at the time of its opening and is still one of the 100 largest suspension bridges. Construction commenced on 14 November 1922 with the bridge being inaugurated on May 13, 1926. The total length is 819.471 metres, with 259 metres of viaduct from the island, a central span of 339.471 metres and 221 metres of viaduct from the mainland. It was closed to the public on May 13, 1991 and reopened after complete restoration on December 30, 2019. Historical background The bridge was commissioned by Herc√≠lio Luz, then governor of the state of Santa Catarina, to be the first permanent link between the island and the mainland. In addition to benefiting the then 40,000 residents of Florian√≥polis that were dependent on ferries to cross between the island and the mainland, Luz wanted to build the bridge to strengthen the position of Florian√≥polis as the state capital. At the time, other cities in the state considered the island to be too remote to be the administrative and political centre and consequently there was a movement to transfer the capital to Lages. Construction Aerial view of Hercilio Luz Bridge The bridge was designed by the firm of Robinson & Steinman, and was built by the American Bridge Company (ABC). All the material it used was brought from the United States. It has the fairly unusual feature that the truss carrying the roadway (a continuous stiffening component) is above the roadway itself and meets up with the eyebar chains making it non-uniform in height. A similar bridge, the Walter Taylor Bridge, was built over the Brisbane River in Brisbane, Australia in 1936. When completed the bridge was the longest eyebar suspension span in existence at that time. The 1,113‚Äô long design features towers with rocker bearings. ABC brought to the project its own experimental heat-treated eyebars, and as project contractor pioneered stiffening techniques that saved materials and money while providing greater rigidity. Another bridge of similar design, the Silver Bridge over the Ohio River in the U.S., collapsed in 1967 due to a failure in one of the eyebars. Luz didn't get to see his bridge completed, dying in 1924 twelve days after having inaugurated a wooden replica built in XV Square specifically for the symbolic act. Originally intended to be named the Independence Bridge this was changed after Luz's death in a posthumous tribute. The bridge was inaugurated on May 13, 1926. The steel structure weighs approximately 5,000 tons, and the foundations and pillars consumed 14,250 m¬≥ of concrete. The two towers rise 74 metres from sea level, and the central span is 43 metres tall. Financing From the beginning, the funding process was complicated. The first bank that had lent to the Catarina government failed. Thus, a new loan had to be obtained delaying the works. In addition, a manoeuvre of the U.S. bankers arranging the financing made the state of Santa Catarina liable for debts of the failed institution. In the end, the cost reached 14.478 trillion reis, ten times the original estimate and almost double the state budget at the time. The repayment of loans, made by U.S. banks, was completed in 1978, more than 50 years after the inauguration of the bridge. Closure With two other bridges (Colombo Sales Bridge and Pedro Ivo Bridge) now linking the island to the mainland, the Herc√≠lio Luz Bridge was closed in 1982 on safety concerns. It reopened again on March 15, 1988 to pedestrian traffic, bicycles, motorcycles and horse-drawn vehicles only. It closed completely on July 4, 1991, after a report analyzing the feasibility of reopening the bridge to vehicular traffic was presented in February 1990. In 1997 the landmark bridge was declared a historical and artistic monument. Restoration of the bridge was investigated by a partnership involving the Federal Government, State Government, and the Municipality of Florian√≥polis. Submission of restoration plans occurred in mid-2013. Restoration Restoration work in February 2017 Construction of the midspan piers for the repair work in August 2015 Restoration work on the approach spans began in 2006, and was completed in 2008 at a cost of . Restoration work on the main span was supposed to begin in 2009, but after delays by the contractor the contract was split into two parts. Rehabilitation of the bridge was started in 2016 by the Portuguese company Teixeira Duarte. Four midspan piers and an under-deck truss were constructed to support the bridge deck during the restoration. The restoration was extensive, involving the replacement of the entire eyebar suspension system, and the pin joints at the bases of the towers. Once reopened the bridge ie carrying one traffic lane in each direction, as well as bicycle and pedestrian paths. Several additions have been made to the original contracted cost. The final cost of the restoration is currently expected to be The first eyebar was replaced on March 21, 2018 and the bridge's re-opening was on December 30, 2019, although some of the temporary supporting structures will not be removed until March 2020. In December 2019, the state government confirmed the reopening of traffic on the bridge, which occurred on 30 December 2019. On that day, more than 200,000 people attended the event celebrating its reopening. The end of construction, however, will occur in 2020, with the removal of auxiliary structures over the central bridge span, alongside the installation of scenic lighting. Initially, only pedestrians and cyclists were able to cross the bridge, but in January 2020, buses and emergency vehicles were allowed to begin crossing. In March, the bridge was opened to all traffic.

UN agencies claim sexual and reproductive health includes physical, as well as psychological well-being vis-a-vis sexuality. Reproductive health implies that people are able to have a responsible, satisfying, healthy reproductive system and safer sex life and that they have the capability to reproduce and the freedom to decide if, when and how often to do so. One interpretation of this implies that men and women should be informed of and have access to safe, effective, affordable and acceptable methods of birth control; also access to appropriate health care services of sexual, reproductive medicine and implementation of health education programs to stress the importance of women to go safely through pregnancy and childbirth could provide couples with the best chance of having a healthy infant. Individuals do face inequalities in reproductive health services. Inequalities vary based on socioeconomic status, education level, age, ethnicity, religion, and resources available in their environment. It is possible for example, that low income individuals lack the resources for appropriate health services and the knowledge to know what is appropriate for maintaining reproductive health.  Reproductive health  The WHO assessed in 2008 that \\"Reproductive and sexual ill-health accounts for 20% of the global burden of ill-health for women, and 14% for men.\\" Reproductive health is a part of sexual and reproductive health and rights. According to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), unmet needs for sexual and reproductive health deprive women of the right to make \\"crucial choices about their own bodies and futures\\", affecting family welfare. Women bear and usually nurture children, so their reproductive health is inseparable from gender equality. Denial of such rights also worsens poverty. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, fertility starts to drop considerably around the age of 32, and around 37, it has a particularly deep nose dive.The Truth About Pregnancy Over 40 By age 44, chances of spontaneous pregnancy approach zero. As such, women are often told to have children before the age of 35, and pregnancy after 40 is considered a high risk. If pregnancy occurs after the age of 40 (geriatric pregnancy), the woman and baby will be monitored closely for:What You Should Know About Having a Baby at 40 * high blood pressure * gestational diabetes * birth defects (i.e. Down syndrome) * miscarriage * low birth weight * ectopic pregnancy  Adolescent health  Teenage birth rate per 1,000 females aged 15‚Äì19, 2000‚Äì2009Live births by age of mother and sex of child, general and age-specific fertility rates: latest available year, 2000‚Äì2009 ‚Äî United Nations Statistics Division ‚Äì Demographic and Social Statistics Adolescent health creates a major global burden and has a great deal of additional and diverse complications compared to adult reproductive health such as early pregnancy and parenting issues, difficulties accessing contraception and safe abortions, lack of healthcare access, and high rates of HIV, sexually transmitted infections and mental health issues. Each of those can be affected by outside political, economic and socio- cultural influences. For most adolescent females, they have yet to complete their body growth trajectories, therefore adding a pregnancy exposes them to a predisposition to complications. These complications range from anemia, malaria, HIV and other STI's, postpartum bleeding and other postpartum complications, mental health disorders such as depression and suicidal thoughts or attempts. In 2016, adolescent birth rates between the ages of 15-19 was 45 per 1000. In 2014, 1 in 3 experienced sexual violence, and there more than 1.2 million deaths. The top three leading causes of death in females between the ages of 15-19 are maternal conditions 10.1%, self-harm 9.6%, and road conditions 6.1%. The causes for teenage pregnancy are vast and diverse. In developing countries, young women are pressured to marry for different reasons. One reason is to bear children to help with work, another on a dowry system to increase the families income, another is due to prearranged marriages. These reasons tie back to financial needs of girls' family, cultural norms, religious beliefs and external conflicts. Adolescent pregnancy, especially in developing countries, carries increased health risks, and contributes to maintaining the cycle of poverty. The availability and type of sex education for teenagers varies in different parts of the world. LGBT teens may suffer additional problems if they live in places where homosexual activity is socially disapproved and/or illegal; in extreme cases there can be depression, social isolation and even suicide among LGBT youth.  Maternal health  Maternal mortality rate worldwide, as defined by the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births from any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management, excluding accidental or incidental causesCountry Comparison: Maternal Mortality Rate in The CIA World Factbook. Date of Information: 2010 99% of maternal deaths occur in developing countries, and in 25 years, the maternal mortality globally dropped to 44%. Statistically, a woman's chance of survival during childbirth is closely tied to her social economic status, access to healthcare, where she lives geographically, and cultural norms. To compare, a woman dies of complications from childbirth every minute in developing countries versus a total of 1% of total maternal mortality deaths in developed countries. Women in developing countries have little access to family planning services, different cultural practices, have lack of information, birthing attendants, prenatal care, birth control, postnatal care, lack of access to health care and are typically in poverty. In 2015, those in low-income countries had access to antenatal care visits averaged to 40% and were preventable. All these reasons led to an increase in the maternal mortality ratio (MMR). One of the international Sustainable Development Goals developed by United Nations is to improve maternal health by a targeted 70 deaths per 100,000 live births by 2030. Most models of maternal health encompass family planning, preconception, prenatal, and postnatal care. All care after childbirth recovery is typically excluded, which includes pre-menopause and aging into old age. During childbirth, women typically die from severe bleeding, infections, high blood pressure during pregnancy, delivery complications, or an unsafe abortion. Other reasons can be regional such as complications related to diseases such as malaria and AIDS during pregnancy. The younger the women is when she gives birth, the more at risk her and her baby is for complications and possibly mortality. Map of countries by fertility rate (2020), according to the Population Reference Bureau There is a significant relationship between the quality of maternal services made available and the greater financial standings of a country.Borghi, Jo. ‚ÄúMobilising Domestic Financial Resources for Development.‚Äù 2002, doi:10.14217/9781848597655-4-en. Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia exemplify this as these regions are significantly deprived of medical staff and affordable health opportunities.Filippi, V√©ronique, et al. ‚ÄúMaternal Health in Poor Countries: the Broader Context and a Call for Action.‚Äù The Lancet, vol. 368, no. 9546, 28 Sept. 2006, pp. 1535‚Äì1541., doi:10.1016/s0140-6736(06)69384-7. Most countries provide for their health services through a combination of funding from government tax revenue and local households. Poorer nations or regions with extremely concentrated wealth can leave citizens on the margins uncared for or overlooked. However, the lack of proper leadership can result in a nation's public sectors being mishandled or poorly performing despite said nation's resources and standing. In addition, poorer nations funding their medical services through taxes places a greater financial burden on the public and effectively the mothers themselves. Responsibility and accountability on the part of mental health sectors are strongly emphasized as to what will remedy the poor quality of maternal health globally. The impact of different maternal health interventions across the globe stagger variously and are vastly uneven. This is the result of a lack of political and financial commitment to the issue as most safe motherhood programs internationally have to compete for significant funding. Some resolve that if global survival initiatives were promoted and properly funded it would prove to be mutually beneficial for the international community. Investing in maternal health would ultimately advance several issues such as: gender inequality, poverty and general global health standards.Nyamtema, Angelo S, et al. ‚ÄúMaternal Health Interventions in Resource Limited Countries: a Systematic Review of Packages, Impacts and Factors for Change.‚Äù BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth, vol. 11, no. 1, 2011, doi:10.1186/1471-2393-11-30. As it currently stands, pregnant women are subjugated to high financial costs throughout the duration of their term internationally that are highly taxing and strenuous. In addition, if the woman and/or the man has a genetic disease, there is risk of these being passed on to the children. Birth control or technical solutions (assisted reproductive technology) can be an option then.Choosing not to choose: reproductive responses of parents of children with genetic conditions or impairmentsGenetic disorders and choices about reproduction  Contraception  Combined oral contraceptive pill A page from De Morbo Gallico (On the French Disease), Gabriele Falloppio's treatise on syphilis. Published in 1564, it describes an early use of condoms. Margaret Sanger, birth control advocate, and her sister Ethyl Byrne, on the courthouse steps in Brooklyn, New York City, January 8, 1917, during their trial for opening a birth control clinic. Contraception has been and still remains in some cultures a controversial issue. Access to reproductive health services is very poor in many countries. Women are often unable to access maternal health services due to lack of knowledge about the existence of such services or lack of freedom of movement. Some women are subjected to forced pregnancy and banned from leaving the home. In many countries, women are not allowed to leave home without a male relative or husband, and therefore their ability to access medical services is limited. Therefore, increasing women's autonomy is needed in order to improve reproductive health, however doing may require a cultural shift. According to the WHO, \\"All women need access to antenatal care in pregnancy, skilled care during childbirth, and care and support in the weeks after childbirth\\". The fact that the law allows certain reproductive health services, it does not necessary ensure that such services are actually in use by the people. The availability of contraception, sterilization and abortion is dependent on laws, as well as social, cultural and religious norms. Some countries have liberal laws regarding these issues, but in practice it is very difficult to access such services due to doctors, pharmacists and other social and medical workers being conscientious objectors. In developing regions of the world, there are about 214 million women who want to avoid pregnancy but are unable to use safe and effective family planning methods. When taken correctly, the combined oral contraceptive pill is over 99% effective at preventing pregnancy. However, it does not protect from sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Some methods, such as using condoms, achieve both protection from STIs and unwanted pregnancies. There are also natural family planning methods, which may be preferred by religious people, but some very conservative religious groups, such as the Quiverfull movement, oppose these methods too, because they advocate the maximization of procreation. One of the oldest ways to reduce unwanted pregnancy is coitus interruptus - still widely used in the developing world. There are many types of contraceptives. One type of contraceptive includes barrier methods. One barrier method includes condoms for males and females. Both types stop sperm from entering the woman's uterus, thereby preventing pregnancy from occurring. Another type of contraception is the birth control pill, which stops ovulation from occurring by combining the chemicals progestin and estrogen. Many women use this method of contraception, however they discontinue using it equally as much as they use it. One reason for this is because of the side effects that may occur from using the pill, and because some health care providers do not take women's concerns about negative side effects seriously. The use of the birth control pill is common in western countries, and two forms of combined oral contraceptives are on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications needed in a basic health system.http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/93142/EML_18_eng.pdf;jsessionid=C5CB19A852D621A6715FF150E2291B8E?sequence=1 There are many objections to the use of birth control, both historically and in the present day. One argument against birth control usage states that there is no need for birth control to begin with. This argument was levied in 1968 when Richard Nixon was elected president, and the argument stated that since birth rates were at their lowest point since World War II ended, birth control was not necessary. Demographic planning arguments were also the basis of the population policy of Nicolae Ceau»ôescu in communist Romania, who adopted a very aggressive natalist policy which included outlawing abortion and contraception, routine pregnancy tests for women, taxes on childlessness, and legal discrimination against childless people. Such policies consider that coercion is an acceptable means of reaching demographic targets. Religious objections are based on the view that premarital sex should not happen, while married couples should have as many children as possible. As such, the Catholic Church encourages premarital abstinence from sex. This argument was written out in Humanae Vitae, a papal encyclical released in 1968. The Catholic Church bases its argument against birth control pills on the basis that birth control pills undermine the natural law of God. The Catholic Church also argues against birth control on the basis of family size, with Cardinal Mercier of Belgium arguing, \\"...the duties of conscience are above worldly considerations, and besides, it is the large families who are the best\\" (Reiterman, 216). Another argument states that women should use natural methods of contraception in place of artificial ones, such as having sexual intercourse when one is infertile. Support for contraception is based on views such as reproductive rights, women's rights, and the necessity to prevent child abandonment and child poverty.https://www.who.int/news-room/fact- sheets/detail/family-planning- contraceptionhttps://www.unfpa.org/resources/rights-contraceptive-information- and-services-women-and-adolescents The World Health Organization states that \\"By preventing unintended pregnancy, family planning /contraception prevents deaths of mothers and children\\".  Sexually transmitted infection  Estimated prevalence in % of HIV among young adults (15‚Äì49) per country as of 2011. Deaths from syphilis in 2012, per million persons Disability- adjusted life year for gonorrhea per 100, 000 inhabitants Condoms offer effective protection from STIs. A Sexually transmitted infection (STI) --previously known as a sexually transmitted disease (STD) or venereal disease (VD)-- is an infection that has a significant likelihood of transmission between humans by means of sexual activity. The CDC analyses the eight most common STI's: chlamydia, gonorrhea, hepatitis B virus (HBV), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human papillomavirus (HPV), syphilis, and trichomoniasis. There are more than 600 million cases of STI's worldwide and more than 20 million new cases within the United States. Numbers of such high magnitude weigh a heavy burden on the local and global economy. A study conducted at Oxford University in 2015 concluded that despite giving participants early antiviral medications (ART), they still cost an estimated $256 billion over 2 decades. HIV testing done at modest rates could reduce HIV infections by 21%, HIV retention by 54% and HIV mortality rates by 64%, with a cost-effectiveness ration of $45,300 per Quality-adjusted life year. However, the study concluded that the United States has led to an excess in infections, treatment costs, and deaths, even when interventions do not improve over all survival rates. There is a profound reduction on STI rates once those who are sexually active are educated about transmissions, condom promotion, interventions targeted at key and vulnerable populations through a comprehensive Sex education courses or programs. South Africa's policy addresses the needs of women at risk for HIV and who are HIV positive as well as their partners and children. The policy also promotes screening activities related to sexual health such as HIV counseling and testing as well as testing for other STIs, tuberculosis, cervical cancer, and breast cancer. Young African American women are at a higher risk for STI's, including HIV. A recent study published outside of Atlanta, Georgia collected data (demographic, psychological, and behavioral measures) with a vaginal swab to confirm the presence of STIs. They found a profound difference that those women who had graduated from college were far less likely to have STIs, potentially be benefiting from a reduction in vulnerability to acquiring STIs/HIV as they gain in education status and potentially move up in demographic areas and/or status.  Abortion  Globally, an estimated 25 million unsafe abortions occur each year. The vast majority of such unsafe abortions occur in developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. The abortion debate is the ongoing controversy surrounding the moral, legal, and religious status of induced abortion. The sides involved in the debate are the self-described ‚Äúpro-choice‚Äù and ‚Äúpro-life‚Äù movements. ‚ÄúPro-choice‚Äù emphasizes the right of women to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy. ‚ÄúPro-life‚Äù emphasizes the right of the embryo or fetus to gestate to term and be born. Both terms are considered loaded in mainstream media, where terms such as ‚Äúabortion rights‚Äù or ‚Äúanti-abortion‚Äù are generally preferred. Each movement has, with varying results, sought to influence public opinion and to attain legal support for its position, with small numbers of anti-abortion advocates using violence, such as murder and arson. Articles from the World Health Organization call legal abortion a fundamental right of women regardless of where they live, and argue that unsafe abortion is a silent pandemic. In 2005, it was estimated that 19-20 million abortions had complications, some complications are permanent, while another estimated 68,000 women died from unsafe abortions. Having access to safe abortion can have positive impacts on women's health and life, and vice versa. \\"Legislation of abortion on request is necessary but an insufficient step towards improving women's health. In some countries where it abortion is legal, and has been for decades, there has been no improvement in access to adequate services making abortion unsafe due to lack of healthcare services. It is hard to get an abortion due to legal and policy barriers, social and cultural barriers (gender discrimination, poverty, religious restrictions, lack of support), health system barriers (lack of facilities or trained personnel). However, safe abortions with trained personnel, good social support, and access to facilities, can improve maternal health and increase reproductive health later in life. The Maputo Protocol, which was adopted by the African Union in the form of a protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, states at Article 14 (Health and Reproductive Rights) that: \\"(2). States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to: [...] c) protect the reproductive rights of women by authorising medical abortion in cases of sexual assault, rape, incest, and where the continued pregnancy endangers the mental and physical health of the mother or the life of the mother or the foetus.\\" The Maputo Protocol is the first international treaty to recognize abortion, under certain conditions, as a woman's human right. The General comment No. 36 (2018) on article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, on the right to life, adopted by the Human Rights Committee in 2018, defines, for the first time ever, a human right to abortion - in certain circumstances (however these UN general comments are considered soft law, and, as such, not legally binding). > \\"Although States parties may adopt measures designed to regulate voluntary > terminations of pregnancy, such measures must not result in violation of the > right to life of a pregnant woman or girl, or her other rights under the > Covenant. Thus, restrictions on the ability of women or girls to seek > abortion must not, inter alia, jeopardize their lives, subject them to > physical or mental pain or suffering which violates article 7, discriminate > against them or arbitrarily interfere with their privacy. States parties > must provide safe, legal and effective access to abortion where the life and > health of the pregnant woman or girl is at risk, and where carrying a > pregnancy to term would cause the pregnant woman or girl substantial pain or > suffering, most notably where the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest > or is not viable. [8] In addition, States parties may not regulate pregnancy > or abortion in all other cases in a manner that runs contrary to their duty > to ensure that women and girls do not have to undertake unsafe abortions, > and they should revise their abortion laws accordingly. [9] For example, > they should not take measures such as criminalizing pregnancies by unmarried > women or apply criminal sanctions against women and girls undergoing > abortion [10] or against medical service providers assisting them in doing > so, since taking such measures compel women and girls to resort to unsafe > abortion. States parties should not introduce new barriers and should remove > existing barriers [11] that deny effective access by women and girls to safe > and legal abortion [12], including barriers caused as a result of the > exercise of conscientious objection by individual medical providers. [13]\\" When negotiating the Cairo Programme of Action at the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), the issue was so contentious that delegates eventually decided to omit any recommendation to legalize abortion, instead advising governments to provide proper post-abortion care and to invest in programs that will decrease the number of unwanted pregnancies. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women considers the criminalization of abortion a \\"violations of women‚Äôs sexual and reproductive health and rights\\" and a form of \\"gender based violence\\"; paragraph 18 of its General recommendation No. 35 on gender based violence against women, updating general recommendation No. 19 states that: \\"Violations of women‚Äôs sexual and reproductive health and rights, such as forced sterilizations, forced abortion, forced pregnancy, criminalisation of abortion, denial or delay of safe abortion and post abortion care, forced continuation of pregnancy, abuse and mistreatment of women and girls seeking sexual and reproductive health information, goods and services, are forms of gender based violence that, depending on the circumstances, may amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.\\" The same General Recommendation also urges countries at paragraph 31 to [...] In particular, repeal: a) Provisions that allow, tolerate or condone forms of gender based violence against women, including [...] legislation that criminalises abortion\\". In 2008, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, a group comprising members from 47 European countries, has adopted a resolution calling for the decriminalization of abortion within reasonable gestational limits and guaranteed access to safe abortion procedures. The nonbinding resolution was passed on April 16 by a vote of 102 to 69. Accesses to abortion is not only a question of legality, but also an issue of overcoming de facto barriers, such as conscientious objections from medical stuff, high prices, lack of knowledge about the law, lack of access to medical care (especially in rural areas). The de facto inability of women to access abortion even in countries where it is legal is highly controversial because it results in a situation where women have rights only on paper not in practice; the UN in its 2017 resolution on Intensification of efforts to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls: domestic violence urged states to guarantee access to \\"safe abortion where such services are permitted by national law\\". There are two primary arguments for maintaining legalized abortion today in the U.S. The first is recognizing the full citizenship of women. The Roe v. Wade court case on abortion compared the citizenship of women and fetuses Because the Constitution defines born people as citizens, Justice Harry Blackmun ruled that fetuses were not citizens. The citizenship of women is emphasized because fetuses are not individual entities that can exist without the woman. Another reason why the full citizenship of women is defined by advocates for abortion is that it recognizes the right of women to manage their own bodies. Fertility affects women's bodies. The argument for abortion prevents others from making decisions that alter a woman's body. Pro- choice advocates also attempt to confirm that state-mandated education or other outside biases don't attempt to influence these decisions. Feminists argue that women throughout history have had to justify their citizenship politically and socially. The right to manage one's own body is a matter of health, safety, and respect. The citizenship of women and the right to manage their own bodies is a societal confirmation that feminists highlight as a pro- choice justification. The second primary argument to uphold legalized abortion and creating better access to it is the necessity of abortion and the health and safety of pregnant women. There are two events that largely changed the course of public opinion about abortion in the U.S. The first is Sherry Finkbine, who was denied access to an abortion by the board of obstetrician- gynecologists at her local hospital. Although she was privileged enough to afford the trip, Finkbine was forced to travel to Sweden for an abortion to avoid caring for a damaged fetus in addition to four children. The other event that changed public opinion was the outbreak of rubella in the 1950s and 60s. Because rubella disrupted the growth of fetuses and caused deformities during pregnancy, the California Therapeutic Abortion Act was signed in 1967. This Act allowed doctors to perform abortions when the pregnancy risked the physical or mental health of the pregnant person. These two events are commonly used to show how the health and safety of pregnant women are contingent upon abortions as well as the ability to give birth to and adequately take care of a child. Another argument in favor of legalized abortion to service necessity are the reasons why an abortion might be necessary. Nearly half of all pregnancies in the United States are unintended, and over half of all unintended pregnancies in the United States are met with abortion. Unintended pregnancy can lead to serious harm to women and children for reasons such as not being able to afford to raise a baby, inaccessibility to time off of work, difficulties facing single motherhood, difficult socio- economic conditions for women. Unintended pregnancies also have a greater potential for putting women of color at risk due to systematically produced environmental hazards from proximity to pollution, access to livable income, and affordable healthy food. These factors as threats to the health and safety of pregnant women run parallel to data that shows the number of abortions in the United States did not decline while laws restricting legal access to abortion were implemented. At a global level, the region with the strictest abortion laws is considered to be Latin America (see Reproductive rights in Latin America), a region strongly influenced by the Catholic Church in Latin America.  Female genital mutilation  Prevalence of FGM by country, according to a 2013 UNICEF report Anti-FGM road sign, Bakau, Gambia, 2005 Female genital mutilation (FGM), also known as female genital circumcision or cutting, is the traditional, non-medical practice of altering or injuring the female reproductive organs, often by removing all or parts of the external genitalia. It is mostly practiced in 30 countries in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia, and affects over 200 million women and girls worldwide. More severe forms of FGM are highly concentrated in Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Sudan. The WHO categorizes FGM into four types: * Type I (Cliteridectomy) is the removal of all or part of the clitoris. This may or may not include removing the prepuce along with the clitoral glans. * Type II (Excision) is the removal of the clitoris along with all or part of the labia minora. This may or may not include removing all or part of the labia majora. * Type III (Infibulation) is the act of removing the inner or outer labia and sealing the wound, leaving only a narrow opening. * Type IV refers to \\"all other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes (piercing, scraping, cauterizing of the genital area).\\" FGM often takes the form of a traditional celebration conducted by an elder or community leader. The age that women undergo the procedure varies depending on the culture, although it is most commonly performed on prepubescent girls. Certain cultures value FGM as coming of age ritual for girls, and use it to preserve a woman's virginity and faithfulness to the husband after marriage. It is also closely connected with some traditional ideals of female beauty and hygiene. FGM may or may not have religious connotations depending on the circumstances. There are no health benefits of FGM, as it interferes with the natural functions of a woman's and girls' bodies, such as causing severe pain, shock, hemorrhage, tetanus or sepsis (bacterial infection), urine retention, open sores in the genital region and injury to nearby genital tissue, recurrent bladder and urinary tract infections, cysts, increased risk of infertility, childbirth complications and newborn deaths. Sexual problems are 1.5 more likely to occur in women who have undergone FGM, they may experience painful intercourse, have less sexual satisfaction, and be two times more likely to report lack of sexual desire. In addition, the maternal and fetal death rate is significantly higher due to childbirth complications. FGM can have severe negative psychological effects on women, both during and after the procedure. These can include long-term symptoms of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and low self-esteem. Some women report that the procedure was carried out without their consent and knowledge, and describe feelings of fear and helplessness while it was taking place. A 2018 study found that larger quantities of the hormone cortisol were secreted in women who had undergone FGM, especially those who had experienced more severe forms of the procedure and at an early age. This marks the body's chemical response to trauma and stress, and can indicate a greater risk for developing symptoms of PTSD and other trauma disorders, although there are limited studies showing a direct correlation. Legislation has been introduced in certain countries to prevent FGM. A 2016 survey of 30 countries showed 24 had policies to manage and prevent FGM, although the process to provide funding, education, and resources were often inconsistent and lacking. Some countries have seen a slight decline in FGM rates, while others show little to no change. The Istanbul Convention prohibits FGM (Article 38).https://rm.coe.int/168046031c Child and forced marriage Poster against child and forced marriage The practice of forcing young girls into early marriage, common in many parts of the world, is threatening their reproductive health. According to the World Health Organization: > \\"The sexual and reproductive health of the female in a child marriage is > likely to be jeopardized, as these young girls are often forced into sexual > intercourse with an older male spouse with more sexual experience. The > female spouse often lacks the status and the knowledge to negotiate for safe > sex and contraceptive practices, increasing the risk of acquiring HIV or > other sexually transmitted infections, as well as the probability of > pregnancy at an early age.\\" Niger has the highest prevalence of child marriage under 18 in the world, while Bangladesh has the highest rate of marriage of girls under age 15.https://www.unicef.org/media/files/Child_Marriage_Report_7_17_LR..pdf Practices such as bride price and dowry can contribute to child and forced marriages.  International Conference on Population and Development, 1994  The International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) was held in Cairo, Egypt, from 5 to 13 September 1994. Delegations from 179 States took part in negotiations to finalize a Programme of Action on population and development for the next 20 years. Some 20,000 delegates from various governments, UN agencies, NGOs, and the media gathered for a discussion of a variety of population issues, including immigration, infant mortality, birth control, family planning, and the education of women. In the ICPD Program of Action,ICPD Program of Action 'reproductive health' is defined as: > a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and...not merely > the absence of disease or infirmity, in all matters relating to the > reproductive system and its functions and processes. Reproductive health > therefore implies that people are able to have a satisfying and safe sex > life and that they have the capability to reproduce and the freedom to > decide if, when and how often to do so. Implicit in this last condition are > the right of men and women to be informed [about] and to have access to > safe, effective, affordable and acceptable methods of family planning of > their choice, as well as other methods of birth control which are not > against the law, and the right of access to appropriate health-care services > that will enable women to go safely through pregnancy and childbirth and > provide couples with the best chance of having a healthy infant.ICPD > Programme of Action, paragraph 7.2. This definition of the term is also echoed in the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women,United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women or the so- called Beijing Declaration of 1995.The United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women However, the ICPD Program of Action, even though it received the support of a large majority of UN Member States, does not enjoy the status of an international legal instrument; it is therefore not legally binding. The Program of Action endorses a new strategy which emphasizes the numerous linkages between population and development and focuses on meeting the needs of individual women and men rather than on achieving demographic targets. The ICPD achieved consensus on four qualitative and quantitative goals for the international community, the final two of which have particular relevance for reproductive health: * Reduction of maternal mortality: A reduction of maternal mortality rates and a narrowing of disparities in maternal mortality within countries and between geographical regions, socio-economic and ethnic groups. * Access to reproductive and sexual health services including family planning: Family planning counseling, pre-natal care, safe delivery and post- natal care, prevention and appropriate treatment of infertility, prevention of abortion and the management of the consequences of abortion, treatment of reproductive tract infections, sexually transmitted diseases and other reproductive health conditions; and education, counseling, as appropriate, on human sexuality, reproductive health and responsible parenthood. Services regarding HIV/AIDS, breast cancer, infertility, delivery, hormone therapy, sex reassignment therapy, and abortion should be made available. Active discouragement of female genital mutilation (FGM). The keys to this new approach are empowering women, providing them with more choices through expanded access to education and health services, and promoting skill development and employment. The programme advocates making family planning universally available by 2015 or sooner, as part of a broadened approach to reproductive health and rights, provides estimates of the levels of national resources and international assistance that will be required, and calls on governments to make these resources available.  Sustainable Development Goals  Half of the development goals put on by the United Nations started in 2000 to 2015 with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Reproductive health was Goal 5 out of 8. To monitor the progress, the UN agreed to four indicators: *Contraceptive prevalence rates *Adolescent birth rate *Antenatal care coverage *Unmet need for family planning Progress was slow, and according to the WHO in 2005, about 55% of women did not have sufficient antenatal care and 24% had no access to family planning services. The MDGs expired in 2015 and were replaced with a more comprehensive set of goals to cover a span of 2016-2030 with a total of 17 goals, called the Sustainable Development Goals. All 17 goals are comprehensive in nature and build off one another, but goal 3 is \\"To ensure health lives and promote wellbeing for all at all ages\\". Specific goals are to reduce global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births, end preventable deaths of newborns and children, reduce the number by 50% of accidental deaths globally, strengthen the treatment and prevention programs of substance abuse and alcohol. In addition, one of the targets of the Sustainable Development Goal 5 is to ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health. By region =Africa= World AIDS Day 2006 event in Kenya Prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Africa HIV/AIDS in Africa is a major public health problem. Sub-Saharan Africa is the worst affected world region for prevalence of HIV, especially among young women. 90% of the children in the world living with HIV are in sub-Saharan Africa. In most African countries, the total fertility rate is very high, often due to lack of access to contraception and family planning, and practices such as forced and child marriage. Niger, Angola, Mali, Burundi, Somalia and Uganda have very high fertility rates. According to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Africa has the lowest rate of contraceptive use (33%) and highest rate of unmet need for contraceptives (22%). The updated contraceptive guidelines in South Africa attempt to improve access by providing special service delivery and access considerations for sex workers, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex individuals, migrants, men, adolescents, women who are perimenopausal, have a disability, or chronic condition. They also aim to increase access to long acting contraceptive methods, particularly the copper IUD, and the introductions of single rod progestogen implant and combined oestrogen and progestogen injectables. The copper IUD has been provided significantly less frequently than other contraceptive methods but signs of an increase in most provinces were reported. The most frequently provided method was injectable progesterone, which the article acknowledged was not ideal and emphasised condom use with this method because it can increase the risk of HIV: The product made up 49% of South Africa's contraceptive use and up to 90% in some provinces. Tanzanian provider perspectives address the obstacles to consistent contraceptive use in their communities. It was found that the capability of dispensaries to service patients was determined by inconsistent reproductive goals, low educational attainment, misconceptions about the side effects of contraceptives, and social factors such as gender dynamics, spousal dynamics, economic conditions, religious norms, cultural norms, and constraints in supply chains. A provider referenced and example of propaganda spread about the side effects of contraception: \\"There are influential people, for example elders and religious leaders. They normally convince people that condoms contain some microorganisms and contraceptive pills cause cancer\\". Another said that women often had pressure from their spouse or family that caused them to use birth control secretly or to discontinue use, and that women frequently preferred undetectable methods for this reason. Access was also hindered as a result of a lack in properly trained medical personnel: \\"Shortage of the medical attendant...is a challenge, we are not able to attend to a big number of clients, also we do not have enough education which makes us unable to provide women with the methods they want\\". The majority of medical centers were staffed by people without medical training and few doctors and nurses, despite federal regulations, due to lack of resources. One center had only one person who was able to insert and remove implants, and without her they were unable to service people who wanted an implant inserted or removed. Another dispensary that carried two methods of birth control shared that they sometimes run out of both materials at the same time. Constraints in supply chains sometimes cause dispensaries to run out of contraceptive materials. Providers also claimed that more male involvement and education would be helpful. Public health officials, researchers, and programs can gain a more comprehensive picture of the barriers they face, and the efficacy of current approaches to family planning, by tracking specific, standardized family planning and reproductive health indicators.

Designed by Ottawa architect George.M.Moiseyev, who was also project architect for the Children's hospital of eastern Ontario, the church is located at 99 Stonehurst Avenue in the Mechanicsville area of Ottawa. It is part of the Montreal and Canada Diocese of ROCOR. History The first Orthodox parish to be organized in Ottawa was the Holy Trinity Bukowinian Church. It was started in 1913 by a small group of immigrants from Bukovina who, on the feast of the Dormition of the Mother of God in 1918, consecrated the first Orthodox church in Ottawa. During the 1920s and 1930s, Holy Trinity Church was a place of worship for all Orthodox Christians in the Ottawa area. In the following decades, most of the various Orthodox ethnic groups organized their own parishes in the nation‚Äôs capital. Russians, however, continued to pray at the Bukowinian church as it was a member of the Eastern Canadian Diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia. Icon of the Protection, 19th century, Russia Intercession of the Theotokos. By the mid-sixties, the Russian community in Ottawa decided to organize its own Orthodox parish. With the blessing of Archbishop Vitaly (Ustinov) of Montreal and Canada, the Protection of the Virgin Mary parish opened in Ottawa on October 21, 1965. At first this new community met in the home of Claudia P. Gitalenko, one of the founding members of the parish. Visiting priest-monks from the St. Job of Pochaev brotherhood in Montreal served at the new church several times a month. Only two years after forming, the parish was able to buy a two-story house at 10 Arthur Street. The building was converted into a church, parish hall, and apartment for the rector. Fr. Theodore, one of the monks of the St. Job of Pochaev brotherhood, was active in furnishing the new church, with the help of the diocesan administration. In 1968 Fr. Vladimir Chikanovsky was assigned as the first rector of the Protection parish. During his short stay, a sisterhood and parish school were organized. Fr. Vladimir was replaced as rector by Archimandrite Gregory Moiseevsky in May 1969. Although Fr. Gregory stayed only one year in Ottawa, he is remembered for his love of the church services and for his care in teaching the young people of the parish reading and singing on kliros. In 1970 Fr. Michael Milonow was assigned as the new rector, but was soon transferred to London, Ontario, after which Fr. Dimitri Sever became the parish priest. By the end of the sixties it became clear that the recently purchased house- church was not sufficient for the needs of the community, and a search began for a building to replace it. In May 1970 the parish acquired a location at a former Protestant church at 267 Richmond Road. In the several months that followed, the interior of this building was completely rebuilt and decorated to make it suitable for Orthodox worship. Icons were painted by Kirill M. Kotkov for the newly built iconostasis. The exterior of the church was crowned with two Russian cupolas constructed and donated by the church warden from Montreal. For the next eighteen years this church was to be the centre of prayer and fellowship for the Russian Orthodox community in Ottawa. On October 18, 1970, only six months after its purchase, the church on Richmond Road was consecrated by Archbishop Vitaly. Frs. Theodore and Gregory, who had worked diligently to establish the parish, participated in the consecration. In the early eighties the parish began exploring the possibility of building a large Russian Orthodox church to house the growing community. Soon it was decided to build not only a new church, but also a large senior citizens‚Äô residence to house elderly Orthodox Christians who wished to live close to church. This ambitious project was dedicated as a monument to the upcoming 1000-year anniversary of the baptism of Russia. In 1986 Fr. George Skrinnikow was assigned as the assistant rector. In the same year, a large piece of land was acquired at 89 and 99 Stonehurst Avenue for the construction of the future St. Vladimir‚Äôs Russian Seniors‚Äô Residence and Holy Virgin Protection Church. Throughout the mid-1980s, Orthodox Christians from all over the world sent donations to help build the new church. St. Vladimir‚Äôs residence, with 65 apartments for seniors, was completed in 1987. The newly built memorial church was consecrated on August 6, 1989, by Metropolitan Vitaly, Archbishop Laurus (≈†kurla) of Holy Trinity Monastery, and Archbishop Paul (Pavlov) of Australia who in the sixties, while still a priest-monk, had travelled from Montreal to serve at the newly organized Protection parish in Ottawa. In 1989 T. N. Vartanova was commissioned to paint the icons for the five-tiered iconostasis. Fr. Dimitri was removed as the rector of the Protection of the Holy Virgin parish in September 1999. The following years proved difficult for the parish. In 2002, after several other priests had served as rectors, Fr. George Skrinnikow was assigned as the new parish priest and life began to return to normal. In 2004 Fr. Stelian Liabotis was assigned as the assistant rector and, in 2006 replaced Fr. George, who retired, as the senior priest. Under their guidance the parish school was reestablished and classes for adults organized. People were again catechized, baptized, and married. Work on the iconostasis resumed and was finally completed in 2011. In 2013 Archbishop Gabriel (Chemodakov), the ruling bishop of the Canadian Diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia and the rector of the parish assigned Fr. Alexis Pjawka as his assistant in Ottawa. For the past half century, the Protection of the Holy Virgin parish in Ottawa has served the Russian Orthodox community in Ottawa and southeastern Ontario. Former members of the parish include a bishop, a deacon, nuns, choir conductors, and seminarians, serving God in various parts of Canada. Today the parish is a multi-ethnic community with Orthodox Greeks, Serbs, Bulgarians, Ukrainians, Arabs, Romanians and Canadian converts joining with Russians from all three immigrations and their descendants to worship God. Present Several charitable fundraisers are held by the church throughout the year. In the spring, the parish hosts a Blini. Since October 2012, the parish has held its annual Taste of Russia Festival in which local artists present a variety of performances and wares including traditional Russian dance, paintings, and genuine Russian products. The licensed event provides a unique opportunity in Ottawa for attendants to purchase Russian beverages and homemade Russian cuisine.

It is used in oil-filled transformers, some types of high-voltage capacitors, fluorescent lamp ballasts, and some types of high-voltage switches and circuit breakers. Its functions are to insulate, suppress corona discharge and arcing, and to serve as a coolant. Transformer oil is most often based on mineral oil, but alternative formulations with better engineering or environmental properties are growing in popularity. Function and properties Oil transformer with air convection cooled heat exchangers in the front and at the side Transformer oil's primary functions are to insulate and cool a transformer. It must therefore have high dielectric strength, thermal conductivity, and chemical stability, and must keep these properties when held at high temperatures for extended periods. Typical specifications are: flash point 140 ¬∞C or greater, pour point ‚àí40 ¬∞C or lower, dielectric breakdown voltage 28 kV (RMS) or greater. To improve cooling of large power transformers, the oil-filled tank may have external radiators through which the oil circulates by natural convection. Power transformers with capacities of thousands of kVA may also have cooling fans, oil pumps, and even oil-to-water heat exchangers.Kenneth R. Edwards, Transformers, American Technical Publishers Ltd., 1996 pp.138-14 Power transformers undergo prolonged drying processes, using electrical self- heating, the application of a vacuum, or both to ensure that the transformer is completely free of water vapor before the insulating oil is introduced. This helps prevent corona formation and subsequent electrical breakdown under load. Oil filled transformers with a conservator (oil reservoir) may have a gas detector relay (Buchholz relay). These safety devices detect the buildup of gas inside the transformer due to corona discharge, overheating, or an internal electric arc. On a slow accumulation of gas, or rapid pressure rise, these devices can trip a protective circuit breaker to remove power from the transformer. Transformers without conservators are usually equipped with sudden pressure relays, which perform a similar function as the Buchholz relay. Mineral oil alternatives Mineral oils are still widely used in the industry. Mineral oil is generally effective as a transformer oil, but it has some disadvantages, one of which is its relatively low flashpoint versus some alternatives. If a transformer leaks mineral oil, it can potentially start a fire. Fire codes often require that transformers inside buildings use a less flammable liquid, or the use of dry-type transformers with no liquid at all. Mineral oil is also an environmental contaminant, and its insulating properties are rapidly degraded by even small amounts of water. Transformers are well equipped to keep water outside the oil for this reason. Pentaerythritol tetra fatty acid natural and synthetic esters have emerged as an increasingly common mineral oil alternative, especially in high-fire-risk applications such as indoors or offshore, due to their low volatility and high fire point, which can be over 300 ¬∞C. They also have a lower pour point, greater moisture tolerance, and improved function at high temperatures, and they are non-toxic and readily biodegradable. Silicone or fluorocarbon-based oils, which are even less flammable, are also used, but they are more expensive than esters, and less biodegradable. A 380 kV transformer with vegetable oil Researchers are experimenting with vegetable-based formulations, using coconut oil for instance. As yet these are unsuitable for use in cold climates or for voltages over 230 kV. Researchers are also investigating nanofluids for transformer use; these would be used as additives to improve the stability and thermal and electrical properties of the oil. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) Polychlorinated biphenyls are a man-made substance first synthesized over a century ago and found to have desirable properties that led to their widespread use. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were formerly used as transformer oil, since they have high dielectric strength and are not flammable. Unfortunately, they are also toxic, bioaccumulative, not at all biodegradable, and difficult to dispose of safely. When burned, they form even more toxic products, such as chlorinated dioxins and chlorinated dibenzofurans. Beginning in the 1970s, production and new uses of PCBs were banned in many countries, due to concerns about the accumulation of PCBs and toxicity of their byproducts. For instance, in the USA, production of PCBs was banned in 1979 under the Toxic Substances Control Act. In many countries significant programs are in place to reclaim and safely destroy PCB contaminated equipment. One method that can be used to reclaim PCB contaminated transformer oil is the application of a PCB removal system, also called a PCB dechlorination system. PCB removal systems use an alkali dispersion to strip the chlorine atoms from the other molecules in a chemical reaction. This forms PCB-free transformer oil and a PCB-free sludge. The two can then be separated via a centrifuge. The sludge can be disposed as regular non-PCB industrial waste. The treated transformer oil is fully restored, meeting the required standards, without any detectable PCB content. It can, thus, be used as the insulating fluid in transformers again. PCBs and mineral oil are miscible in all proportions, and sometimes the same equipment (drums, pumps, hoses, and so on) was used for either type of liquid, so PCB contamination of transformer oil continues to be a concern. For instance, under present regulations, concentrations of PCBs exceeding 5 parts per million can cause an oil to be classified as hazardous waste in California.California Code of Regulations, Title 22, section 66261 Testing and oil quality Transformer oils are subject to electrical and mechanical stresses while a transformer is in operation. In addition there is contamination caused by chemical interactions with windings and other solid insulation, catalyzed by high operating temperature. The original chemical properties of transformer oil change gradually, rendering it ineffective for its intended purpose after many years. Oil in large transformers and electrical apparatus is periodically tested for its electrical and chemical properties, to make sure it is suitable for further use. Sometimes oil condition can be improved by filtration and treatment. Tests can be divided into: # Dissolved gas analysis # Furan analysis # PCB analysis # General electrical & physical tests: #* Color & Appearance #* Breakdown Voltage #* Water Content #* Acidity (Neutralization Value) #* Dielectric Dissipation Factor #* Resistivity #* Sediments & Sludge #* Flash Point #* Pour Point #* Density #* Kinematic Viscosity The details of conducting these tests are available in standards released by IEC, ASTM, IS, BS, and testing can be done by any of the methods. The Furan and DGA tests are specifically not for determining the quality of transformer oil, but for determining any abnormalities in the internal windings of the transformer or the paper insulation of the transformer, which cannot be otherwise detected without a complete overhaul of the transformer. Suggested intervals for these test are: * General and physical tests - bi-yearly * Dissolved gas analysis - yearly * Furan testing - once every 2 years, subject to the transformer being in operation for min 5 years. On-site testing Some transformer oil tests can be carried out in the field, using portable test apparatus. Other tests, such as dissolved gas, normally require a sample to be sent to a laboratory. Electronic on-line dissolved gas detectors can be connected to important or distressed transformers to continually monitor gas generation trends. To determine the insulating property of the dielectric oil, an oil sample is taken from the device under test, and its breakdown voltage is measured on- site according to the following test sequence: * In the vessel, two standard- compliant test electrodes with a typical clearance of 2.5 mm are surrounded by the insulating oil. * During the test, a test voltage is applied to the electrodes. The test voltage is continuously increased up to the breakdown voltage with a constant slew rate of e.g. 2 kV/s. * Breakdown occurs in an electric arc, leading to a collapse of the test voltage. * Immediately after ignition of the arc, the test voltage is switched off automatically. * Ultra fast switch off is crucial, as the energy that is brought into the oil and is burning it during the breakdown, must be limited to keep the additional pollution by carbonisation as low as possible. *The root mean square value of the test voltage is measured at the very instant of the breakdown and is reported as the breakdown voltage. * After the test is completed, the insulating oil is stirred automatically and the test sequence is performed repeatedly. * The resulting breakdown voltage is calculated as mean value of the individual measurements.

This overwhelming growth in population made it nearly impossible for the previously established law enforcement to regulate any longer which resulted in the organization of vigilantes. These militias hanged eight people and forced several elected officials to resign. Each Committee of Vigilance formally relinquished power after three months. 1851 Hanging of Samuel Whittaker and Robert McKenzie, August 24, 1851 The 1851 Committee of Vigilance was inaugurated on June 9 with the promulgation of a written doctrine declaring its aims The Rivals: William Gwin, David Broderick, and the Birth of California By Arthur Quinn, 1997, p. 109 and hanged John Jenkins of Sydney, Australia, on June 10 after he was convicted of stealing a safe from an office in a trial organized by the committee: grand larceny was punishable by death under California law at the time.Johnson, John. Historic US Court Cases. Pg. 49. Routelidge, 2001 The June 13 Daily Alta California printed this statement: It boasted a membership of 700 and claimed to operate in parallel to, and in defiance of, the duly constituted city government. Committee members used its headquarters for the interrogation and incarceration of suspects who were denied the benefits of due process. The Committee engaged in policing, investigating disreputable boarding houses and vessels, deporting immigrants, and parading its militia. Four people were hanged by the Committee; one was whipped (a common punishment at that time); fourteen were deported to Australia; fourteen were informally ordered to leave California; fifteen were handed over to public authorities; and forty-one were discharged. The 1851 Committee of Vigilance was dissolved during the September elections, but its executive members continued to meet into 1853. A total of four were executed: John Jenkins, an Australian from Sydney accused of burglary, who was hanged on June 10, 1851; James Stuart, also from Sydney and accused of murder, who was hanged on July 11, 1851; and Samuel Whittaker and Robert McKenzie, associates of Stuart accused of \\"various heinous crimes\\", who were hanged on August 24, 1851. The lynching of Whittaker and McKenzie occurred three days after a standoff between the Committee and the nascent police force trying to protect the prisoners; the Committee nabbed Whittaker and McKenzie after storming the jail during Sunday church services.Hittell, T.H. History of California Vol 3 (1897), pp. 313-330. The Committee also tried to punish arsonists.Gordon Morris Bakken, Law in the western United States, Norman, University of Oklahoma Press, 2000, p. 110. 1856 1856 Committee of Vigilance medallion inscribed: \\"Organized 9th June 1851. Reorganized 14th May 1856. Be Just and Fear Not.\\" The eye symbol was borrowed from Freemasonry, but in its 1856 vigilante context conveyed surveillance as a means of social discipline, not the Masonic meaning of scientific and aesthetic knowledge. Note that Lady Justice is not blindfolded. The Committee of Vigilance was reorganized on 14 May 1856 by many of the leaders from the first one and adopted an amended version of the 1851 constitution. Unlike the earlier Committee, and the vigilante tradition generally, the 1856 Committee was concerned with not only civil crimes but also politics and political corruption. The catalyst for the Committee was a murder, in the guise of a political duel in which James P. Casey shot opposition newspaper editor James King of William. King, along with many San Francisco residents, was outraged by Casey's appointment to the city board of supervisors and believed that the election had been rigged. The motivation behind this murder came from King's publishing an article in the Daily Evening Bulletin accusing Casey of illegal activities, and serving a prison term for Grand Larceny in New York. The combination of the political unrest surrounding the election and the article resulted in Casey's shooting of James King. The 1856 Committee was also much larger than the Committee of 1851, claiming 6,000 in its ranks. The Committee worked very closely with the formal government of San Francisco. President of the vigilance committee, William T. Coleman was a close friend of Governor J. Neely Johnson and the two men met on several occasions working towards the shared goal of stabilizing the town. Another important figure at this time who would later come to make a name for himself in the Civil War is William T. Sherman. Sherman was running a bank when Governor Johnson requested he become the commander of the San Francisco branch of the state militia. Sherman accepted the position two days before the murder of King by Casey. The 1856 Committee of Vigilance dissolved on 11 August 1856, and marked the occasion with a \\"Grand Parade.\\" Political power in San Francisco was transferred to a new political party established by the vigilantes, the People's Party, which ruled until 1867 and was eventually absorbed into the Republican Party. The vigilantes had thus succeeded in their objective of usurping power from the Democratic Party machine that hitherto dominated civic politics in the city. Notable people included William Tell Coleman, Martin J. Burke, San Francisco mayor Henry F. Teschemacher, and San Francisco's first chief of police James F. Curtis. Vigilante headquarters in 1856 consisted of assembly halls, meeting rooms, a military kitchen and armory, an infirmary, and prison cells, all of which were fortified with gunny sacks and cannons. Four people were officially executed again in 1856, but the death toll also includes James \\"Yankee\\" Sullivan, an Irish immigrant and professional boxer who killed himself after being terrorized and detained in a Vigilante cell. The 1856 Committee also engaged in policing, investigations, and secret trials, but it far exceeded its predecessor in audacity and rebelliousness. Most notably, it seized three shipments of armaments intended for the state militia and tried the chief justice of the California Supreme Court. The Committee's authority, however, was bolstered by almost all militia units in the city, including the California Guards. Controversy From the Daily Evening Bulletin, James King of William, Editor. May 14, 1856: The hanging of Cora and Casey There remains historical controversy about the vigilance movements. For example, both Charles Cora and James Casey were hanged in 1856 as murderers by the Committee of Vigilance: Cora shot and killed U.S. Marshal William H. Richardson who had drunkenly insulted Cora's mistress, Belle Cora,Asbury, Herbert. The Barbary Coast: An Informal History of the San Francisco Underworld. p. 84. Basic Books, 2002. while Casey shot James King of William, editor of rival newspaper The Evening Bulletin, for publishing an editorial that exposed Casey's criminal record in New York.Asbury, Herbert. The Barbary Coast: An Informal History of the San Francisco Underworld. pp. 86‚Äì87. Basic Books, 2002. King had also denounced the corruption of City Officials who he believed had let Cora off the hook for Richardson's murder: Cora's first trial had ended in a hung jury, and there were rumors that the jury had been bribed. Casey's friends sneaked him into the jail precisely because they were afraid that he would be hanged. This hanging may have been a response by frustrated citizens to ineffectual law enforcement, or a belief that due process would result in acquittals. Popular histories have accepted the former view: that the illegality and brutality of the vigilantes was justified by the need to establish law and order in the city. One prominent critic of the San Francisco vigilantes was General W. T. Sherman, who resigned from his position as Major- general of the Second Division of Militia in San Francisco. In his memoirs, Sherman wrote: > As [the vigilantes] controlled the press, they wrote their own history, and > the world generally gives them the credit of having purged San Francisco of > rowdies and roughs; but their success has given great stimulus to a > dangerous principle, that would at any time justify the mob in seizing all > the power of government; and who is to say that the Vigilance Committee may > not be composed of the worst, instead of the best, elements of a community? > Indeed, in San Francisco, as soon as it was demonstrated that the real power > had passed from the City Hall to the committee room, the same set of > bailiffs, constables, and rowdies that had infested the City Hall were found > in the employment of the \\"Vigilantes.\\" Influence in British Columbian affairs A former member of the San Francisco Committee of Vigilance, physician Max Fifer, moved to Yale, British Columbia at the time of the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush, and participated in the organization of a Vigilance Committee on the Fraser River in 1858 to address issues of lawlessness and a vacuum of effective governmental authority created by the sudden influx of prospectors to the new British colony.Donald J. Hauka, McGowan's War, Vancouver: New Start Books, 2003, p. 136 The Vigilance Committee, which in San Francisco had persecuted disgraced Philadelphia lawyer Ned McGowan, played a role in the bloodless McGowan's War on the lower Fraser in 1858‚Äì1859. At the end of the so-called \\"War\\", McGowan was convicted by Judge Matthew Baillie Begbie of an assault against Fifer in British ColumbiaHauka, p. 180 but McGowan's defense statement, which described some of the activities of the San Francisco vigilantes and his own personal experience of vigilantism, impressed and disturbed Begbie who, like Colonial Governor James Douglas was determined to prevent conditions in the goldfields of British Columbia from deteriorating into mob rule.Hauka, p. 182 In popular culture *The Californians (TV series) *Death Valley Days: Episode: \\"The Battle of San Francisco Bay\\" See also *Sydney Ducks *Samuel Brannan *William Tell Coleman *McGowan's War *List of incidents of civil unrest in the United States References Bibliography * John Boessenecker , ed.

Many communities such as Seven Meadows, Grand Lakes, and Cinco Ranch are zoned to the school. While the school has a Katy address, it is within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of Houston, and is a high school of the Katy Independent School District (KISD). History The school was originally planned by Katy ISD to relieve overcrowding at Cinco Ranch High School and Katy High School and to better facilitate the influx of students due to new development planned in the general Katy area. The school plan was the same general design used for two other KISD schools, Morton Ranch High School and Cinco Ranch High School, and was designed by PBK Architects. The school's first year in operation was the 2005-2006 school year and had its first graduating class of 408 students in the 2007-2008 school year. The school was nominated a \\"National Blue Ribbon School of 2008.\\"\\"2007-2008 Seven Lakes High School Profile.\\" Katy Independent School District. Accessed September 28, 2008. Background The school is located in the Katy Independent School District, and has the distinction of being the largest high school construction project at one time in the state of Texas.KatyISD - Communications Seven Lakes was designed by PBK Architects, as were many other area schools. It is also the second largest, as well as the most expensive, school in the United States to be built at one time. The total cost of the school came around to $77,424,704 after construction was complete. The name of the school is derived from two major communities that are zoned to it, Seven Meadows and Grand Lakes, taking \\"Seven\\" from the name of the Seven Meadows community and \\"Lakes\\" from the name of the Grand Lakes community. While the school is meant only for a maximum of 3,000 students, schools in Katy ISD often become overcrowded due to the rapid development in the area as was the case in 2012, when Seven Lakes reached its peak of 3,957 students. The school maintains a rivalry of sorts with Cinco Ranch High School, another high school also located in the same school district as Seven Lakes (Katy Independent School District) and located 3 miles away. Logically, much of the area now zoned to Seven Lakes was originally zoned to Cinco Ranch High School before Seven Lakes opened, and much of the area zoned to the new Tompkins High School was previously zoned to Seven Lakes.

It was written by Amy Spies and stars Sarah Jessica Parker, Lee Montgomery, Morgan Woodward, Jonathan Silverman, Shannen Doherty, and Helen Hunt.GIRLS JUST WANT TO HAVE FUN Monthly Film Bulletin; London Vol. 52, Iss. 612, (Jan 1, 1985): 280. Its story follows Janey, a new girl in town who meets Lynne, both share a passion for dancing (Dance TV). Together the two enter a competition to be a new Dance TV regular couple, however Janey's father doesn't approve. The film was produced by Chuck Russell and was released on April 12, 1985. It grossed $1.7 million in its opening weekend and $6.3 million worldwide, against a budget of $5 million. It received generally negative reviews and has a 38% approval rating based on 13 votes on Rotten Tomatoes. Despite its negative reviews, the film was regularly aired on Comedy Central, Lifetime, USA Network, Lifetime Movie Network and ABC Family for several years and has become a cult film. Plot Janey Glenn is an army brat whose father Robert has retired from the Army and relocated to Chicago, the home of her favorite dance show Dance TV. At her Catholic girls school, she quickly makes a new friend in Lynne Stone due to their shared love of Dance TV. Although Robert nixes the idea of her traveling to downtown Chicago to try out as a dancer for Dance TV, Janey accompanies Lynne to the auditions anyway. At the auditions, an enemy is made of spoiled rich girl Natalie Sands when she narrowly misses Lynne while parking her car. The auditions are going well until Lynne's partner is cut (it is later discovered that Natalie bribed Lynne's partner to sabotage her audition). Janey and a local high school kid, Jeff, both shine, and are partnered together once they make the finals. Jeff loves to dance, though he feels pressured to attend trade school after graduation, like his father did before him. The two butt heads initially due to their disparate upbringings. Despite Jeff's natural ability to dance, he has never taken a class. Janey has been taking both gymnastics and dance classes for ten years. Helping them to get off on the wrong foot is also Janey's inability to practice, due to her strict father's rules. Things are further complicated by Natalie's meddling as she finds out that Janey skipped choir practice to meet Jeff and calls her father to tell, posing as \\"Sister Natalie\\". An excellent opportunity for both girls to get back at Natalie presents itself when Jeff is invited to her coming out party. They make hundreds of copies of her invitation (provided by Jeff's best friend Drew) and pass them out to quite a few odd characters all over town. Jeff and Drew attend the party and watch the chaos ensue when all of the oddballs that were given invites show up (as do Lynne, Janey and Jeff's sister Maggie, watching from the window). Janey and Jeff have become close through their rehearsals. One night, he tells her to meet him not at the rehearsal studio but at a club. While they are enjoying some unstructured dance time, Jeff is taken away by a girl who locked her keys in her car. Meanwhile, a large admirer moves in on her. On Jeff's return, a fight ensues and after Jeff sucker punches the much larger man, they run out of the club together. Once at Janey's house, she is aglow over what her life has become: she is in the running to become a Dance TV regular, has a great best friend, as well as a boyfriend. They finally kiss before she excitedly runs inside. Given the total wreck the party became, the rivalry with Natalie has intensified. She convinces her father to become more involved in ensuring her win. This is an easy feat considering that her father owns the company that Jeff's father works for. One day, Natalie's father, J.P. Sands, corners Jeff and tells him that if Natalie does not win, Jeff's father will lose his job. This puts him in a bad mood and he has a falling-out with Janey when he arrives at rehearsal. Her mood quickly matches his when she arrives home and sneaks into the house only to find that her father has installed a security system. He then grounds her for her continuous deception, making it virtually impossible for her to attend the dance contest final the next day. Meanwhile, Jeff's surly attitude and decreased desire to be in the contest is noticed by his father. Once he finally gets his son to talk, he simply asks if he can win the contest. When Jeff answers yes, he is instructed to do so and not to worry about his father's job. However, Janey is still on restriction and does not know Jeff has changed his mind. However, that changes when her little brother brings her a message that Jeff will compete and she employs Lynne to get her out of the house undetected. Once Lynne arrives, Janey cuts the wires to the security system and escapes the clutches of the guard dog. When they arrive at the station, Janey makes the elevator up to the studio and Lynne does not. She barely makes the beginning of the show, embracing and kissing Jeff as she arrives. The show begins and the competition is underway. At home, Janey's family turns on the television and sees her dancing. Her father, furious, storms out of the house, on the way to the studio. Meanwhile, Jeff's father watches the show from his neighborhood pub, surrounded by friends who are all cheering on Jeff and Janey. After all of the dancers have performed on the live show, the decision comes back: there is a tie between Janey and Jeff and Natalie and her partner. A dance-off ensues. Natalie goes first and when done, strolls off the stage proudly, believing she has won. But after Janey tells Jeff \\"Let's do it\\", they pull out all the stops with a series of synchronized gymnastics Janey has taught Jeff over their time together. When the judges deliberate again, the decision is unanimous: Jeff and Janey win. Natalie is furious and begins to berate her partner over costing her the contest. When she goes to her father to complain, he finally puts his foot down and tells his spoiled daughter to shut up, to her amazement. When Janey spots her father in the studio, she thinks she is in for trouble, but he smiles and shows his enthusiasm at her obvious talent.

The Oxford Electric Bell or Clarendon Dry Pile is an experimental electric bell that was set up in 1840 and which has run nearly continuously ever since. It was one of the first pieces purchased for a collection of apparatus by clergyman and physicist Robert Walker. It is located in a corridor adjacent to the foyer of the Clarendon Laboratory at the University of Oxford, England, and is still ringing, albeit inaudibly due to being behind two layers of glass. Design The experiment consists of two brass bells, each positioned beneath a dry pile (a form of battery), the pair of piles connected in series. The clapper is a metal sphere approximately 4 mm in diameter suspended between the piles, which rings the bells alternately due to electrostatic force. As the clapper touches one bell, it is charged by one pile, and then electrostatically repelled, being attracted to the other bell. On hitting the other bell, the process repeats. The use of electrostatic forces means that while high voltage is required to create motion, only a tiny amount of charge is carried from one bell to the other, which is why the piles have been able to last since the apparatus was set up. Its oscillation frequency is 2 hertz.Oxford Electric Bell, Atlas Obscura. The exact composition of the dry piles is unknown, but it is known that they have been coated with molten sulphur for insulation and it is thought that they may be Zamboni piles. At one point this sort of device played an important role in distinguishing between two different theories of electrical action: the theory of contact tension (an obsolete scientific theory based on then-prevailing electrostatic principles) and the theory of chemical action. The Oxford Electric Bell does not demonstrate perpetual motion. The bell will eventually stop when the dry piles have distributed their charges equally if the clapper does not wear out first.The World's Longest Experiment , The Longest List of the Longest Stuff at the Longest Domain Name at Long Last.The Latest on Long-Running Experiments , Improbable Research. The Bell has produced approximately 10 billion rings since 1840 and holds the Guinness World Record as \\"the world's most durable battery [delivering] ceaseless tintinnabulation\\". Operation Apart from occasional short interruptions caused by high humidity, the bell has rung continuously since 1840. The bell may have been constructed in 1825.

She was the General Secretary of the National Regeneration Movement between 2017 and 2020. She was the Party of the Democratic Revolution's nominee for Governor of the State of Mexico in the 2005 election and served as a senator from the State of Mexico from 2006 to 2012.  Early life and name change Daughter of Guillermina Camacho Amezcua and Colonel Cuitl√°huac Ib√°√±ez Trevi√±o, she had a difficult childhood. First, the unstable Ib√°√±ez-Camacho marriage ended in divorce when Yeidckol (then called Citlali) was still a very little girl, at a time when Mexican society viewed women separated from their husbands as immoral. Seeking protection from her ex- husband, Mrs. Camacho pretended to be a relative of Mexican President Manuel √Åvila Camacho, an assertion that would later cause great problems for the family. In 1970 the chaos of her family life reached its most extreme when Citlali, only 12 years old, became pregnant in very controversial circumstances for the time. She had to leave school. Wanting to protect her family from further social derision, her mother changed all of her children's names and adopted Yeidckol's newborn son as her own. In a press conference on 2 March 2005, Polevnsky explained that her original name is Citlali Ib√°√±ez Camacho, but that due to family conflicts, her mother decided to change it to \\"Yeidckol\\", which in Hebrew means \\"the call of God.\\" http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/724563.html Polevnsky stated in another interview that her name was Polish.http://www.cronica.com.mx/nota.php?id_nota=309401  Professional career  She studied psychology at the Universidad An√°huac in Mexico City. She has served various positions inside the C√°mara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformaci√≥n (CANACINTRA) (es), including a period in 2002 as first woman president.  Political career  In 2005 she was nominated by the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) as the candidate for governor for the 2005 State of Mexico election. She lost to PRI's Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, who would later on become President of Mexico in 2012. In the 2006 general election she supported the presidential campaign of Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador and was elected to the Senate, representing the State of Mexico. In 2014, she resigned from the PRD and joined the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) and ran as a mayoral candidate for Naucalpan, State of Mexico, for the 2015 elections. Following the loss during the 2015 elections, on 20 November 2015, she was elected as General Secretary of MORENA.

Founded in 1870 by northern Baptists, it was originally a teachers' college. It has since expanded to offer majors in many disciplines across the liberal arts. The campus includes buildings in the Benedict College Historic District, a historic area listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History Benedict College was founded in 1870 on land that had been a plantation in Columbia, South Carolina. Bathsheba A. Benedict of Pawtucket of Rhode Island provided the $13,000.00 to purchase the land as part of the American Baptist Home Mission Society. Benedict Institute opened on December 12, 1870, on the grounds of a plantation formerly worked by slaves, to educate African-Americans recently freed from slavery. Benedict's first class consisted of ten freedmen and one teacher, the Reverend Timothy L. Dodge, D.D. He was a college-trained preacher from the North, who became president of the Institute. Benedict Institute set out from humble beginnings in a dilapidated former slaveholder's mansion to prepare men and women to be \\"powers for good in society\\". The dilapidated mansion, built in 1839, served as the first schoolhouse, where grammar school subjects, along with Bible and theology, were taught. Eventually, other subjects were added to the curriculum to address the original objective of the school: to train teachers and preachers. On November 2, 1894, the institution was chartered as a liberal arts college by the South Carolina Legislature and the name Benedict Institute was changed to Benedict College. From 1870 to 1930, Benedict College was led by a succession of seven northern white Baptist ministers, all college trained. On April 10, 1930, the Reverend John J. Starks, who earned his bachelor's degree from the college in 1891, became the first African-American president of the college. Five African-American presidents have succeeded him. =Late 20th century to present= In 1994, with a strategic planning process in place, Benedict College set an enrollment goal of \\"2000 by the year 2000\\". The goal was achieved in 1996 with an enrollment of 2,138 students. The fall 2002 enrollment was 3,000. Benedict College is engaged in an ongoing strategic planning process, which will guide the college in the 21st century. The college is implementing a $50 million campus improvement plan, which includes land acquisition and the completion of a comprehensive athletics complex. Campus facilities improvements over the past nine years have included installation of air-conditioning, fire sprinkler systems, and security systems in residence halls; completion of an activities field and community park; renovation of historic Antisdel Chapel, Bacoats and Alumni Halls, and restoration of historic Morgan, Pratt, and Starks halls, including the Student Leadership Development Center. During this period, new construction has included three residence halls, a parking garage, a campus center/dining hall, an Administration Building, and a Business Development Center. Additionally, buildings were acquired to house a fitness center, and the Division of Community Development/Center for Excellence. Three apartment complexes have been purchased for student housing. As a part of the college's community development thrust, more than 50 dilapidated properties in the adjacent community have been renovated. Benedict College Historic District The Benedict College Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. It encompasses five buildings constructed between 1895 and 1937: Morgan Hall (1895), Pratt Hall (1902), Duckett Hall (1925), Antisdel Chapel (1932), and Starks Center (1937). and accompanying map Academics Benedict offers 29 degrees from 12 departments.

The Bristol Channel floods, 30 January 1607, drowned many people and destroyed a large amount of farmland and livestock. The known tide heights, probable weather, extent and depth of flooding, and coastal flooding elsewhere in the UK on the same day all point to the cause being a storm surge rather than a tsunami. Description Flood plaque, in St Mary's Church, Goldcliff, near Newport. On 30 January 1607, around noon, the coasts of the Bristol Channel suffered from unexpectedly high floodings that broke the coastal defences in several places. Low-lying places in Devon, Somerset, Gloucestershire, and South Wales were flooded. The devastation was particularly severe on the Welsh side, extending from Laugharne in Carmarthenshire to above Chepstow in Monmouthshire. Cardiff was the most badly affected town, with the foundations of St Mary's Church destroyed. It is estimated that 2,000 or more people were drowned, houses and villages were swept away, an estimated of farmland inundated, and livestock destroyed, wrecking the local economy along the coasts of the Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary. The coast of Devon and the Somerset Levels as far inland as Glastonbury Tor, from the coast, were also affected. The sea wall at Burnham-on-Sea gave way, and the water flowed over the low-lying levels and moors. Thirty villages in Somerset were affected, including Brean which was \\"swallowed up\\" and where seven out of the nine houses were destroyed with 26 of the inhabitants dying. For ten days the Church of All Saints at Kingston Seymour, near Weston-super-Mare, was filled with water to a depth of . A chiselled mark remains showing that the maximum height of the water was 7.74 metres (25 feet 5 inches) above sea level. A number of commemorative plaques still remain, up to above sea level, showing how high the waters rose on the sides of surviving churches. For example, at Goldcliff near Newport the church has a small brass plaque, inside on the north wall near the altar, today about above ground level, marking the height of the flood waters. The plaque records the year as 1606 because, under the Julian calendar in use at that time, the new year did not start until Lady Day, 25 March. The resultant financial loss in the parish was estimated as ¬£5,000. The flood was commemorated in a contemporary pamphlet entitled God's warning to the people of England by the great overflowing of the waters or floods. Contemporary accounts of the flood were written by people such as the Puritan pamphleteer, William Jones: Cause There are similarities to descriptions of the 1953 floods in East Anglia which were caused by a storm surge. A 2006 paper by Horsburgh and Horritt demonstrated that the tide and probable weather at the time were capable of generating a surge consistent with the observed inundation. They point to an exceptionally high spring tide in the Bristol Channel on 30 January 1607 of 7.86m, a severe south-westerly gale with peak winds measured at Barnstaple from 3am to noon, and coastal flooding in East Anglia at night on the 30th consistent with a storm tracking eastward. =Tsunami hypothesis= An earlier 2002 research paper, following investigations by Professor Simon Haslett of Bath Spa University and Australian geologist Ted Bryant of the University of Wollongong, suggested that the flooding may have been caused by a tsunami, after the authors had read some eyewitness accounts in the historical reports which described the flood. The British Geological Survey has suggested that, as there is no evidence of a landslide off the continental shelf, a tsunami would most likely have been caused by an earthquake on a known unstable fault off the coast of southwest Ireland, causing the vertical displacement of the sea floor. One contemporary report describes an earth tremor on the morning of the flood; however, other sources date this earthquake to a few months after the event. Haslett and Bryant's evidence for the tsunami hypothesis included massive boulders that had been displaced up the beach by enormous force; a layer up to thick composed of sand, shells and stones within an otherwise constant deposit of mud that was found in boreholes from Devon to Gloucestershire and the Gower Peninsula; and rock erosion characteristic of high water velocities throughout the Severn Estuary. However, in attributing the flood to a storm surge in their 2006 paper, Horsburgh and Horritt show that those proposing a tsunami hypothesis underestimate the volume of water and coastal damage involved in storm surges, and failed to account both for flooding on the opposite side of the country on the same day. There is also a lack of evidence for the event impacting West Wales, Cornwall or southern Ireland. Their tsunami modelling showed that it would not be possible for a tsunami not to affect these areas and cause flooding elsewhere in the country. Contemporary sources also indicate the flooding proceeded for a period of five hours, which is consistent with a storm surge rather than a tsunami. Future recurrence While the risk of similar events in the foreseeable future is considered to be low, it is estimated that the potential cost caused by comparable flooding to residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural property could range from ¬£7 to ¬£13 billion at 2007 insured values. There has also been concern that the nuclear power stations at Hinkley Point and Oldbury could be endangered. On the 400th anniversary, 30 January 2007, BBC Somerset looked at the possible causes and asked whether it could happen again in the county.

It is located on a plateau with an elevation of 823 meters. It became a city in 1856. History Panari√°, an extinct J√™ language, was once spoken near the town. The town was founded in 1809 by the sergeant Ant√¥nio Eust√°quio da Silva e Oliveira. The city's name is derived from Tupi language and it means \\"bright water\\". It was classified as an indigenous territory in February 1811 and then as freguesia (parish) in 1809 with the name of Santo Ant√¥nio e S√£o Sebasti√£o do Uberaba. It became a city on February 22, 1836. Uberaba is located in the Brazilian's region known as Tri√¢ngulo Mineiro.

Clark saved from destruction a large portion of Kentucky's printed history, which later became a core body of documents in the Kentucky Department for Libraries and Archives. Often referred to as the \\"Dean of Historians\\" Clark is best known for his 1937 work, A History of Kentucky. Clark was named Historian Laureate of the Commonwealth of Kentucky in 1991. Early years Born in Louisville, Mississippi to a cotton farmer and a schoolteacher, Thomas Clark received his primary education in a neighborhood school to the third grade . After that he made it only to the seventh grade at his mother's school. He dropped out of school to work at a sawmill and as many southern boys did in those days, helped out on the family farm. At sixteen, he took a job on a dredge boat that scoured the bed of the Pearl River. His mother urged him to get back in school. In an interview, Clark recalled: > I left the boat in September 1920. Without a job. Without a future, really. > I accidentally met a boy who told me about an agricultural high school > Choctaw County Agricultural High School. I went down and within 10 minutes > of getting off the train I'd registered. The old superintendent didn't ask > me one thing about my education. He didn't know if I could read or write. > Said you look like a big stout boy. You look like you'd make a good football > player. So I was admitted as a football player. I went to that school for > four years [and obtained] reasonably basic preparation. =University of Mississippi= Clark had decided that farming, manual labor and river work were not going to meet his needs. At the urging of his parents, he entered the University of Mississippi in September 1925. While there, he met his first mentor, historian Charles S. Sydnor, who held a Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University. Even though Clark had but one class under Sydnor, British history, which wasn't even within his interests, the two had \\"deep conversations\\" about the rich heritage of the old South. Sydnor encouraged Clark to follow his interests into post graduate studies in the field of History. It was at Ole Miss that Clark discovered the significance of his birthday and understood for the first time what Bastille Day was about. Clark \\"fell in love with learning\\" at that time, improved his use of the English language and began to develop writing and study habits that framed the disciplines through which he was to accomplish great things later in his life. Clark had financed his education at Ole Miss with a cotton crop on land his father had given him but before he graduated the funds had all but run out. He then found a golf course that needed tending and took the job. It turned out that budding writer, William Faulkner, also having a hard time with finances, helped Clark tend the golf course. Clark was later quite surprised to see that Faulkner had \\"hit the bigtime\\" with his writing. He graduated with honors earning a BA in 1928. =University of Kentucky= Clark, through his new- found interest in history had begun attending meetings of the American Historical Association (AHA). It was there that Clark claims to have been exposed to the profession of the historian through two major personalities he saw at the AHA meeting in Indianapolis, Indiana (December 1928): *Ulrich Phillips - with Slavery: The Central Theme of Southern History *James Breasted - with The New Crusade, Upon hearing the presentations Clark recalls, \\" I came home thoroughly convinced I wanted to be a historian.\\" Receiving scholarships to both the University of Cincinnati and to the University of Kentucky, he chose the latter. Clark went on to receive his master's degree in history but when he would go further, the financial dilemma struck again. At the last minute, he was offered a fellowship at Duke. =Duke University= At Duke, Clark centered his research on the American frontier, the development of Midwestern railroads, and slavery issues of the South. While there, he met Martha Elizabeth Turner who was to become his wife of 62 years and mother of his two children . He completed his doctorate in History in 1931. From there, it was back to the University of Kentucky, where he was to teach history by day and develop library resources by night. =Professorship at UK= Clark became a professor at the University of Kentucky in 1931. With few resources at his disposal, he almost single-handedly built Kentucky's history department into a major doctoral program in southern history. At one point its star- studded faculty included Albert D. Kirwan, Clement Eaton, James F. Hopkins, Holman Hamilton, Steven A. Channing, and Charles P. Roland. Clark began a 70-year-long enterprise at cataloging, organizing, rescuing, and preserving Kentucky's history. He established at UK a culture of respect for the heritage and documentation of the past. He re-organized the History department, bringing revolutionary innovations to the way the subject was researched and taught. His comprehensive methods were inclusive and exhaustive in scope and detail yet presented to his students in a logical and eloquent manner. Upon receiving news that irreplaceable historical documents were being abused and defaced in Frankfort, Dr Clark rushed to the scene from Lexington. There he found that pages of military records of Kentuckians involved in the Battle of 1812, the Mexican war and the Civil War were being used as temporary sleeping cots and pipe lighters. He appealed to the newly elected Gov. A.B. \\"Happy\\" Chandler to have the documents moved to the Lexington campus. If not for this intervention, vast portions of Kentucky's History would have been missing from the Archives that are preserved to this day. Clark's subsequent appeals to the Legislature and the Governors led to the eventual establishment of the Kentucky Archives Commission in 1957. Dr Thomas Clark became head of the history department in 1941 and a distinguished professor in 1950. His good- natured, down-to-earth style and gentle charm made him a favorite among students and fellow faculty which made it possible for him to recruit the vast amount of help needed to build and maintain the growing Kentucky archives. He labored to lead the effort toward completion and retained the workforce even after his retirement as department head in 1965 and his final retirement as professor in 1968. Clark remained a respected and influential adviser to various government agencies throughout his tenure at the university. He was outspoken in matters of timber and natural resource conservation, fiscal responsibility, constitutional and education reform, and especially human rights. He was capable and articulate in framing current policy against the lessons of history and careful to skillfully represent only primary sources whenever possible ‚Äì a praxis which earned him immense respect, not only in Kentucky and the US, but around the world. His public visibility earned him a name for taking an appreciation of history to the people ‚Äì not hiding in the halls of academia. Clark fought to preserve cultural heritage for the benefit of future generations and to promote public awareness and appreciation of the same in his own day: Clark remained an active member of the American Historical Association and spoke on countless occasions in many venues both academic and non-academic. He was a proponent of the Kentucky Education Reform Act of 1991. He lived to see the dedication and opening of the Kentucky History Center in Frankfort in April 1999. The Center was renamed after Clark in 2005 as the Thomas D. Clark Center for Kentucky History. Clark died on June 28, 2005 at the age of 101.

It takes place in a world of truehumans, truedragons, and dragonlords - beings which have both human and dragon souls and can change from human to dragon and vice versa at will. The Last Dragonlord refers to a central character of the book, Linden Rathan, so called because he is the last dragonlord to have been born in more than 600 years. He is also the only dragonlord without a soultwin, who is another dragonlord with the other half of his dragon and human souls. The Last Dragonlord was published in 1998. It was followed by two sequels, Dragon and Phoenix in 1999 and Bard's Oath in 2012. The Dragonlords watch over the Five Kingdoms, serving as impartial juries in disputes between kingdoms or involving high ranking nobles as they are seen as above the common interests due to their extremely long lives. When the Queen of Cassori dies in suspicious circumstances, leaving behind only a young son as her heir, Linden and the two other dragonlords are called in to investigate, and to prevent a civil war as two rival human nobles vie for the regency. As the court infighting escalates, Linden becomes a target of the Fellowship, a secret society of humans who feel that dragonlords should stay out of human politics and who are willing to use black magic to kill the dragonlords if necessary to get their way. Linden is helped in his investigation by his old friend, Bard Otter, and by the ship captain he meets through him, Maurynna, who may be the only one who can help Linden bring Cassori back from the brink of civil war.

The hollow point made the express bullet lighter, faster, and disabled thin-skinned animals more quickly than a solid bullet, at the expense of penetration power and bullet sturdiness. The term express was first applied to hunting rifles and ammunition beginning in the middle 19th century, to indicate a rifle or ammunition capable of higher than typical velocities. The early express cartridges used a heavy charge of black powder to propel a lightweight, often hollow point bullet, at high velocities to maximize point blank range. Later the express cartridges were loaded with nitrocellulose based gunpowder, leading to the Nitro Express cartridges, the first of which was the .450 Nitro Express. The term express is still in use today, and is applied to rifles, ammunition, and a type of iron sight. With the widespread adoption of small bore, high velocity rifle cartridges, the meaning of express has shifted in modern usage, and refers to high velocity, large bore rifles and ammunition, typically used for hunting large or dangerous game at close range. History The name originates with a rifle built by James Purdey in 1856 (based on a pattern established a year earlier by William Greener) and named the Express Train, a marketing phrase intended to denote the considerable velocity of the bullet it fired. It was not the first rifle or cartridge of this type but it was Purdey's name express that stuck. To understand the context of the express cartridge, it is necessary to go back to the weapons that preceded them. Early hunting firearms were typically smoothbore, usually firing a spherical projectile. This meant that a given bore size must fire a given weight of projectile, which put significant limits on the external and terminal ballistics of the gun. The significant arc of the slow round ball limited the maximum point-blank range to very short distances, and the spherical nature of the ball required a large bore diameter to carry a ball large and heavy enough to provide a quick kill on large game. These early smoothbore guns were typically measured by gauge, as most modern shotguns still are, rather than by caliber. Typical gauges used ranged from 12 to 4; the 4 gauge, used for large game, fired a massive ball of 1500 grains weight (97 g). In the 19th century, rifled firearms increasingly gained popularity, and the cylindrical (conical) bullet was introduced. This allowed a wide range of bullet weights to be used with a single bore size; the .450 Black Powder Express, for example, was loaded with bullets ranging from a 270 grain hollow point bullet for small game such as deer, to a 360 grain solid bullet for use on dangerous game, to even heavier hardened bullets for use on elephant. The early black powder express cartridges used paper patched lead bullets, to prevent lead buildup in the bore at the high velocities. These bullets were made of soft lead, and even in solid form they expanded readily and provided great killing power. Typically the trajectory height would not be greater than 4.5 inches at and the rifle would have a muzzle velocity of at least . While is not fast by modern standards, it was relatively fast in the era of black powder and spherical balls. As nitro powders were introduced and became the standard, bores grew smaller, and velocities grew ever larger, until the term express grew to mean something other than just high velocity. William Greener, for example, splits British sporting rifles at the turn of the 20th century into four classes: *Large bore smoothbores, or Elephant guns *Medium bore high velocity rifles, the express rifle *Small bore, higher velocity rifles, the long range express rifle *Miniature, short range rifles, or Rook rifle Since then, express has gradually changed to denote a large bore diameter combined with high velocity. The 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica, for example, lists express cartridges ranging from .360 to .577 caliber. The traditional express rifles were break action designs, either single- or double-barrel designs, and express rifles are still made in this form today. With the advent of repeating actions, many bolt-action rifles were chambered in express cartridges, and often the same cartridge will be found in \\"flanged\\" and \\"rimless\\" form, the flanged for break-open actions, and the rimless for easier feed from a bolt- action rifle's magazine. Many modern rifle cartridges fire large-caliber, heavy bullets at velocities of well over , and the designation express applies solely to British calibres whereas the word magnum applies to American calibres. With a few exceptions, such the .242 Rimless Nitro Express from the 1920s, and a brief period around 1980 when Remington renamed their .280 Remington cartridge the 7 mm Express Remington, the label express is today used for short range, big game rifles pushing large, fast bullets. Another item to bear the name express is the iron sight combination, used by William Greener and still found on express rifles today, consisting of a bead front sight and shallow \\"V\\" rear sight. The large, usually white bead is easily seen in low light and the shallow \\"V\\" notch provides an unobstructed view of the surrounding area. Ammunition Traditional express cartridges tend to be long cases, working at low pressures. This is partially due to their black powder roots, but the low pressure cases are also more reliable under extreme conditions, such as found in African hunting. Modern designs may use the belted magnum design; older ones may be rimmed for break actions or rimless for bolt-action rifles. The bullets were typically short, light, hollow-point designs intended for maximum velocity and ranges out to the maximum point blank range with fixed sights. Early cartridges were loaded with black powder, and many later converted to cordite or other smokeless powders, often yielding two similar cartridges with different loadings, such as the .450 Black Powder Express and the .450 Nitro Express. Older express cartridge ballistics are fairly similar to modern shotgun slug ballistics, while modern big game cartridges, such as the .577 Tyrannosaur and the .585 Nyati, provide ballistics that push the physical limits of the hunter with their tremendous power and recoil. =Examples= There is a large variety of express rounds, including the Nitro Express family of cartridges. Older black powder express cartridges include: * .450/400 Black Powder Express * .450 Black Powder Express * .500/450 No 1 Black Powder Express * .500/450 Magnum Black Powder Express * .500 Black Powder Express * .577/500 No 2 Black Powder Express * .577 Black Powder Express * 20/577 Alexander Henry Rifle design Express rifles historically came in two forms, singles (single shot) and doubles, both break-actions. The side-by-side double was among the earliest, but by the early 20th century the bolt action began to replace it. The double rifle has two barrels, either side-by-side or over-and-under, and either single or double triggers. Most parts of the mechanism that fire the gun are duplicated for redundancy. In the unlikely event that a mechanical failure such as a broken spring or firing pin should occur, the hunter can still fire the second barrel. This design allows the hunter to fire two shots rapidly‚Äîthe second shot used when the animal is missed or not stopped with the first. If the hunter were using a bolt-action rifle, he would have to work the bolt, taking additional time and possibly affecting the aim. Bolt-action rifles for hunting typically have a small magazine of about five rounds rather than the ten, thirty, or more found on more modern military rifles firing smaller rounds (the maximum number of rounds a hunting rifle can take is fixed by law in many jurisdictions; 2 in the magazine and one in the chamber is the limit in the UK.) Modern express rifles are generally either single-shot or bolt-action designs. Doubles are still made but are quite expensive; getting both barrels to shoot to the point of aim is a labor-intensive process. Single-shot rifles are not often used when hunting dangerous game because follow-up shots are not made as quickly. Single-shot express rifles, such as the Ruger No. 1 Tropical, are more compact than bolt actions, but while they can weigh less, reduced weight tends to increase felt recoil. Lighter rifles are more likely to be in the hunter's hands, ready for a quick shot when game is found. =Examples= *Sturm, Ruger See also *James Purdey and Sons *John Rigby & Company *Eley Brothers *Heym *Holland & Holland *Westley Richards *Table of handgun and rifle cartridges References * See Rifle in the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition * Review of the Ruger M77MKII Magnum in .458 Lott External links * M77 MKII Magnum and #1 Tropical rifles, in calibers from .375 H&H; to .458 Lott Category:Hunting equipment Category:Rifles ","title":"Express (weaponry)"},{"id":"2159930","text":"Edward Clarke Cabot (August 17, 1818 - January 5, 1901) was an American architect and artist. Early life 250px Cabot's father was Samuel Cabot Jr., a shipping businessman. His mother was Eliza Perkins Cabot. He had six siblings: Thomas Handasyd Cabot (b. 1814), Samuel Cabot III (b. 1815), James Elliot Cabot (b. 1821), Stephen Cabot (b. 1826), Walter Channing Cabot (b. 1829), and Louis Cabot (b. 1837). Career Cabot designed the Gibson House for widow Catherine Hammond Gibson and her son Charles Hammond Gibson Jr, as well as the new building for the Boston Athenaeum between 1847 and 1849. After the opening of the Boston Athenaeum, he became a leading figure in Boston architectural circles. The Athenaeum was influenced by Charles Barry's Italianate club house in London. He is also noted for producing several distinguished Queen Anne Style houses in the 1870s. Cabot later formed a firm \\"Cabot and Chandler\\" which built numerous residences in the Back Bay and Boston environs. In 1879, Cabot & Chandler responded to H.H. Richardson's introduction of the Stick Style of Architecture into the U.S. by his Sherman Watts House in Newport, with Cabot's splendid mansion for Elbridge Torrey at 1 Melville Avenue in Dorchester, MA. The same year the firm designed 12 Fairfield Street in Boston's Back Bay for Georgiani Lowell. Personal life In 1842, Cabot married Martha Eunice Robinson. In 1873, he married Louisa Winslow Sewall. He was the father of football player Norman Winslow Cabot.

Nu√±o Beltr√°n de Guzm√°n, on December 3, 1531, hired Crist√≥bal de O√±ate to establish a village in Nochistl√°n; the village would be named Guadalajara to honor Guzm√°n for having been born in Guadalajara. Guadalajara was founded in Nochistl√°n on January 5, having as officials Crist√≥bal de O√±ate, Sancho Ortiz de Z√∫√±iga and Miguel Ibarra. They worked at this project for only 16 months and created the first layout of Guadalajara. The first news that we have regarding the natives of these lands points to the Tecuexe. These people established settlements around 1000. Later in the 12th century a new group of people moved in, these people were called Caxcan and they were from the valley in Tuitl√°n, which is now found in the municipality of Villanueva, Zacatecas. The Caxcan established Nochistl√°n by driving out the Tecuexe by force. Pueblo Magico After its 841st anniversary of foundation, Nochistlan was named \\"Pueblo M√°gico\\" or \\"Magic town\\" by the Secretary of Tourism (Mexico), Gloria Guevara Manzo. Nochistl√°n was the fifth town to be named \\"Pueblo M√°gico\\" in the state of Zacatecas. To be nominated for this category, a town must have symbolic attributions, legends, history, significant cultural traditions, and attract tourists. Nochistl√°n met all of these requirements, which made it eligible to be taken into further consideration. Music Nochistl√°n is known for its traditions as well as its music. It is also often referred to as, ‚ÄúLa tierra de los m√∫sicos‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe land of musicians‚Äù. Nochistl√°n has been given this nickname because within the town, there is always music playing. From Mariachi groups, to bands, as well as choirs, it is proud of their different styles of music and is not ashamed of them. In fact, Nochistl√°n's music is one of the main reasons tourists visit so much, aside from the beautiful architecture. In addition, it is also one of the reasons it was named, ‚ÄúPueblo M√°gico‚Äù because of its music. Many of the musicians that form groups come from families that were also in musical groups, which explains why Nochistl√°n is such a musical place. Economic activities There are 3 main activities that contribute to the economy: agriculture, livestock, and trade. Transportation Nochistl√°n is a very rural place with active transportation. Transportation in this town mostly consists of walking since everything is within walking distance, cars, buses, trucks, as well as horses. Because of this, Nochistlan gives people a very welcoming and an all-original feeling that is unparalleled in a sense. Most of the people who inhabit Nochistlan live by nature. That is, a lot of their resources are native, making Nochistlan somewhat old-fashioned. Nonetheless, in recent years it has been modernizing their ways of living. A common form of transportation es la combi or motorcycles. Traditions = El Papaqui = The oldest tradition in Nochistl√°n is ‚Äúla fiesta del Papaqui‚Äù or translated as, ‚Äúthe party of el Papaqui.‚Äù This party is celebrated every year from January 12 to January 20. El Papaqui is a celebration in which the whole town honors and venerates St. Sebastian. St. Sebastian is a very important figure to those who live and are from Nochistl√°n. During these eight days, everyone walking in the plaza has their face covered with flour, and crack colored eggs filled with confetti on their heads. They also throw oranges, These actions symbolize what was going on during the war between the Natives and Spanish. The flour symbolizes the dirt people would put on their faces to create a more savage look. It is not most about war it is just to celebrate San Sebasti√°n, the Saint most admired from that pueblo. = El Jard√≠n = Another tradition Nochistl√°n is famous for is their tradition of every Sunday night. Every Sunday night, people gather in the plaza or, ‚Äúel Jard√≠n‚Äù of Nochistl√°n for \\"la Serenata\\" the serenade. All the men of the town form a circle around the plaza while the women walk inside the circle. As the women walk inside the circle, if a man finds a woman attractive, in original tradition, he would give her a Gardenia flower (in most recent, modern tradition, he puts confetti in her hair, or hollowed out eggs with confetti inside) there is also another circle, within the inner circle, where children and married women go around to get confetti too but also they are there so men know they are married or in a relationship. The Gardenia flower (recent tradition, modern tradition, the colorful confetti) symbolizes the beauty of the woman just as flowers (recent tradition, modern tradition, colors) are beautiful. This tradition originally began to honor women and moreover, to make them feel appreciated by men. = Las Fiestas de Octubre = The Virgin of Toyahua is a respected figure in Nochistl√°n because she is known to grant miracles. Most of the residents of Nochistl√°n pray to her when they are in need of a marvel. Although Nochistl√°n is small in size, it is big in religion. The feast of October are religious parties to honor St. Francis of Assisi that are celebrated on the first Sunday of October. During these parties, people gather in the plaza to enjoy music from many bands and mariachi groups. Aside from the music, even though the feast is meant for religious events, it's just a big party with very famous bandas come and perform the parties will last from early 8:00 p.m. and sometimes carry on until 5:00 a.m. all the women in the town come together to make food for those participating in the celebration. The festivities also consist of authentic dances, horse races, and rooster tournaments.

Biography Smyth was born in Northern California and started his career in the female-fronted melodic progressive metal band Ariah after graduation in 1988. Ariah never released an official studio album, but they recorded a few songs and played local shows with bands like Vicious Rumors and King Diamond. Ariah disbanded in 1992. After a three- year hiatus, he joined the power metal band Vicious Rumors to replace guitarist Mark McGee who had left the band after the death of Vicious Rumors vocalist Carl Albert. Something Burning (1996) was the first album which Smyth played on. It was followed by Cyberchrist in 1998, and now he participated in songwriting too. In 1999, Smyth left Vicious Rumors and joined Testament. The Bay Area thrash legend had just released The Gathering album, but lead guitarist James Murphy was diagnosed with a brain tumor, so Testament were in want of a new guitarist for the forthcoming tour. In the next 5 years Smyth toured with Testament all around the globe and played uncountable shows as a member of the band. He wanted to make a studio album with Testament but that remained a dream for him. On the other hand, Smyth formed the band Dragonlord as a side project with guitarist Eric Peterson and bassist Steve DiGiorgio of Testament in 2000. This symphonic black metal outfit have released two albums: Rapture (2001) and Black Wings of Destiny (2005). Seattle-based Nevermore had been friends with Smyth prior to his joining of the band. Initially jokingly, he asked if he could join Nevermore. He joined Nevermore as a touring guitarist, and in 2004, Smyth officially joined the band after helping them tour in Europe. He played guitar in the band along with Jeff Loomis and co- wrote some songs on the critically acclaimed album This Godless Endeavor (2005). On April 30, 2006, Smyth released a message explaining to fans that he has been diagnosed with kidney failure due to a congenital birth defect. Updates followed on May 30, June 3, and August 9, 2006 on his official website. On December 12, 2006, Smyth had a successful kidney transplantation. Smyth guest starred as Snazz of Pickles' former band Snakes n' Barrels in two episodes of Metalocalypse. In the summer of 2007, Smyth left Nevermore due to \\"personal and business differences\\". At that time he was working on an all- instrumental album in the vein of progressive rock with his former Ariah bandmate and bassist Steve Hoffman. This side project was named \\"EssenEss\\" after their same first names, as a transcription of S'n'S (Steve and Steve). Self-titled The EssenEss Project debut album released on November 5, 2007. Smith currently is teaching at the London Institute of Contemporary Music Performance and is now a member of Forbidden. Smyth at the Byron Bay Bluesfest 2015 Steve started an international metal band with classic and modern influences, featuring members carefully selected by Smyth: Mikkel Sandager (Mercenary) on vocals, Jamie Hunt (Biomechanical) sharing guitar duties, rounded out by a powerhouse rhythm section with Tomas \\"O'Beast\\" Koefoed (MNEMIC) on bass guitar and Michele Sanna on drums (although former drummer Raphael Saini of Italian band Chaoswave played on the album). http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/one-machine-featuring-ex-testament-mercenary- ex-mnemic-members-distortion-lyric-video/#3Y2vD6VClhMyKURm.99 Their debut album The Distortion of Lies and the Overdriven Truth was released on February 18, 2014 via Scarlet Records.

Biography He was born in Wewak, Papua New Guinea, the third son in a family of four children of John, an Australian Government doctor, and Eve Akerman (d. 2003), a newspaper columnist and reviewer. The family left PNG for India in 1951, before returning to Perth, Western Australia. He attended Guildford Grammar School, where he remained until his expulsion, when he was \\"asked to leave\\" following a dispute with the headmaster. He spent the last few months of his schooling at Christ Church Grammar School but did not complete his final exams. Career He worked for a time at British national newspaper, The Times, and spent ten years as a foreign correspondent in the United States. On returning to Australia, he was editor of The Advertiser, Adelaide (1988) and The Sunday Herald Sun, Melbourne (1990). During 1990-92 he was editor-in-chief of the Herald & Weekly Times group in Melbourne before becoming a vice-president of Fox News, USA in 1993. Mark Latham was known to weave complaints about Akerman's writing into his speeches. Periodically, Akerman was a regular panelist on ABC Television's political commentary program Insiders, until his 16 June 2013 participation. This incident involved unfounded allegations about the then Prime Minister's de facto partner. Akerman had also appeared on the ABC's political program Q&A.; Controversies =Climate change scepticism= Akerman is a climate change sceptic with a history of public opposition to a carbon price. He approvingly quotes the work of the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC), run by Fred Singer. In a November 2006 article in The Daily Telegraph, Akerman mis-quoted senior IPCC scientist John T. Houghton saying \\"Unless we announce disasters, no one will listen\\", attributing the quotation to his 1994 book Global Warming, The Complete Briefing. The mis-quote became widely used among climate change sceptics to argue that climate change scientists showed a propensity to exaggerate their case. However, the mis-quote does not appear in any edition of the book. Houghton denied saying any such thing and believes the opposite to be true, commenting \\"I would never say we should hype up the risk of climate disasters in order to get noticed.\\" In February 2010, Akerman responded by citing a September 1995 article in which Houghton was correctly quoted as saying \\"If we want a good environmental policy in the future, we'll have to have a disaster\\", adding that this passage was not much different to the misquotation Houghton had distanced himself from. A subsequent report by Media Watch noted that Houghton's full remark did not carry the same meaning: \\"If we want a good environmental policy in the future we'll have to have a disaster. It's like safety on public transport. The only way humans will act is if there's been an accident.\\"Jonathan Holmes. Malice, misquotes and Media Watch abc.net.au, 24 February 2010. =Sexual harassment= Five former employees, three of whom agreed to be named, have said they witnessed Akerman \\"sexually harass\\" female members of his staff, according to a 1991 story in The Sunday Age. =Assault threat= One of the most controversial episodes in Akerman's life was his alleged threat to assault the literary editor of The Advertiser, Shirley Stott Despoja.

Biography Glenford Andrew Tetley, Jr. was born on February 3, 1926 in Cleveland, Ohio.Allen Robertson, \\"Glen Tetley\\", in International Encyclopedia of Dance, vol. 6, ed. Selma Jeanne Cohen (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), 145. While in medical school, Tetley found a passion for dance. After graduating from Franklin and Marshall College in 1946, Tetley moved to New York City to study dance.Allen Robertson, \\"Glen Tetley\\". He began his career as a dancer, dancing in Hanya Holm's Broadway production of Kiss Me, Kate in 1948 and Juno in 1959, as well as with the New York City Opera Ballet, John Butler's American Dance Theatre, and the Joffrey Ballet where he was an original member.Allen Robertson, \\"Glen Tetley\\". Later he danced with American Ballet Theatre and Jerome Robbins's Ballets: USA.Allen Robertson, \\"Glen Tetley\\". Tetley's choreographic style rises from his experiences with modern dance teachers like Hanya Holm and Martha Graham as well as his time with ballet teachers such as Antony Tudor and Margaret Craske.American Ballet Theatre, \\"Glen Tetley\\". Because of this mix in dance education, Tetley's choreography is a distinct blend between ballet and modern dance.Glen Tetley, in Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Tetley wanted to achieve a mix of \\"modern dance's visceral earthiness with the ethereal lyricism of classical ballet\\".Michael F. Crabb, Glen Tetley (1926-2007), Dance Magazine, January 2007. Mary Hinkson, a former dancer from the original Martha Graham company, has assisted Glen Tetley all over the world. Her knowledge of the Graham technique helped shaping ballet dancers into Tetley's choreography. Choreography What made Glen Tetley stand out among other choreographers was his ability to seamlessly mix ballet and modern dance. Tetley choreographed over 50 ballets for some of the world's most famous dance companies. Tetley made his choreographic premier in 1962 with Pierrot Lunaire which he choreographed for his newly formed chamber company.Allen Robertson, \\"Glen Tetley\\". Tetley based this piece on music of the same name by composer Arnold Schoenberg. Though this piece was one of his first choreographic ventures, it is heralded by many as one of his best and most iconic. It is also here where audiences first saw his iconic mix of ballet and modern dance.Allen Robertson, \\"Glen Tetley\\". Other works choreographed by Tetley include: Contredances, Gemini, Odalisque, Ricercare, Le Sacre du Printemps, Sargasso, Sphinx, and Voluntaries.American Ballet Theatre, \\"Glen Tetley\\". Tetley moved to Europe and became the Artistic Director for the Netherlands Dance Theatre in 1969 and the Stuttgart Ballet where he also danced from 1974‚Äì1976, before returning to North America to work with the National Ballet of Canada.American Ballet Theatre, \\"Glen Tetley\\". While in Europe and Canada, Tetley choreographed many new pieces such as Alice in 1986 for the National Ballet of Canada.Allen Robertson, \\"Glen Tetley\\". At the time of his departure, many in the American dance community would either train in ballet or modern dance, but never both. Some believe that because of this rigidity and inability to accept the fusion of modern dance and ballet, Tetley moved to Europe where the atmosphere was more artistically free.Michael F. Crabb, \\"Glen Tetley (1926-2007)\\". =Style= Throughout his choreography Tetley displayed \\"fervid intensity, sinuous nonstop propulsion, and voluptuous physicality\\".Allen Robertson, \\"Glen Tetley\\". While Tetley does not intentionally create abstract pieces, he uses his movement in order to \\"convey his meditations on themes from myth, music, theater, and literature\\".Allen Robertson, \\"Glen Tetley\\". Personal life His long term partner of 40 years was Scott Douglas. On January 26, 2007, Tetley died in Florida, aged 80, following a battle with skin cancer. Dancers, such as Karen Kain, a member of the National Ballet of Canada, remember Tetley as a choreographer who had a \\"ferocious demand for total artistic commitment\\", while David Allan recalls that Tetley \\"fired up your imagination and made you look at yourself differently\\".Michael F. Crabb, \\"Glen Tetley (1926-2007)\\". Among the members of his chamber company was Christopher Bruce, the lead in his signature work, Pierrot Lunaire who cites Tetley as one of his inspirations.

This is usually done for pathways whose products may be needed in different amounts at different times, such as hormone production. Regulatory enzymes exist at high concentrations (low Vmax) so their activity can be increased or decreased with changes in substrate concentrations. The enzymes which catalyse chemical reactions again and again are called regulatory enzymes.  Overview  Generally, it is considered that a hyperbolic structured protein in specific media conditions is ready to do its task, it is active, but some specific deactivation, are responsible for the regulation of some metabolism pathways. Regulatory enzymes are commonly the first enzyme in a multienzyme system: the product of the reaction catalyzed by the first enzyme is the substrate of the second enzyme, so the cell can control the amount of resulting product by regulating the activity of the first enzyme of the pathway. There are many strategies of activation and deactivation of regulatory enzymes. Regulatory enzymes require an extra activation process and need to pass through some modifications in their 3D in order to become functional, for instance, catalyzing enzymes (regulatory enzymes). The regulation of the activation of these catalyzing enzymes is needed in order to regulate the whole reaction speed, so that it is possible to obtain the amount of product required at any time, that makes regulatory enzymes have a biological importance. Therefore, regulatory enzymes, by its controlled activation and are of two types: allosteric enzymes and covalently modulated enzymes; however, an enzyme can combine both types of regulation.  Allosteric enzymes  In a) the allosteric enzyme functions normally. In b), it is inhibited This type of enzymes presents two binding sites: the substrate of the enzyme and the effectors. Effectors are small molecules which modulate the enzyme activity; they function through reversible, non-covalent binding of a regulatory metabolite in the allosteric site (which is not the active site). When bound, these metabolites do not participate in catalysis directly, but they are still essential: they lead to conformational changes in a concrete part of the enzyme. These changes affect the overall conformation of the active site, causing modifications on the activity of the reaction. Properties Allosteric enzymes are generally larger in mass than other enzymes. Different from having a single subunit enzyme, in this case they are composed of multiple subunits, which contain active sites and regulatory molecule binding sites. They present a special kinetics: the cooperation. In here, configuration changes in each chain of the protein strengthen changes in the other chains. These changes occur at the tertiary and quaternary levels of organisation. Based on modulation, they can be classified in two different groups: * Homotropic allosteric enzymes: substrate and effector play a part in the modulation of the enzyme, which affects the enzyme catalytic activity. * Heterotropic allosteric enzymes: only the effector performs the role of modulation. = Feedback inhibition = In some multienzyme systems, the enzyme is inhibited by the end product whenever its concentration is above the requirements of the cell. So, the velocity of the reaction can be controlled by the amount of product that is needed by the cell (the lower the requirement is, the slower the reaction goes). Feedback inhibition is one of the most important function of proteins. Due to feedback inhibition, a cell is able to know whether the amount of a product is enough for its subsistence or there is a lack of the product (or there is too much product). The cell is able to react to this kind of situation in a mechanical way and solve the problem of the amount of a product. An example of feedback inhibition in human cells is the protein aconitase (an enzyme that catalyses the isomeration of citrate to isocitrate). When the cell needs iron, this enzyme loses the iron molecule and its form changes. When this happens, the aconitase is converted to IRPF1, a translation repressor or mRNA stabilizer that represses the formation of iron- binding proteins and favours formation of proteins that can get iron from the cell's reservations  Covalently modulated enzymes  Here, the active and inactive form of the enzymes are altered due to covalent modification of their structures which is catalysed by other enzymes. This type of regulation consists of the addition or elimination of some molecules which can be attached to the enzyme protein. The most important groups that work as modifiers are phosphate, methyl, uridine, adenine and adenosine diphosphate ribosyl. These groups are joined to or eliminated from the protein by other enzymes. The most remarkable covalent modification is phosphorylation. Serine, Threonine and Tyrosine are common amino acids that participate in covalent modifications and are used to control enzyme‚Äôs catalytic activities. Kinase and phosphatases are commonly known enzymes that affect these modifications, which result in shifting of conformational states of the binding affinity to substrate. = Phosphorylation = Phosphorylation of an enzyme Phosphorylation is the addition of phosphate groups to proteins, which is the most frequent regulatory modification mechanism in our cells. This process takes place in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells (in this type of cells, a third or a half of the proteins experience phosphorylation). Because of its frequency, phosphorylation has a lot of importance in regulatory pathways in cells. The addition of a phosphoryl group to an enzyme is catalysed by kinase enzymes, while the elimination of this group is catalysed by phosphatase enzymes. The frequency of phosphorylation as a regulatory mechanism is due to the ease of changing from phosphorylated form to dephosphorylated form. Phosphorylation or dephosphorylation make the enzyme be functional at the time when the cell needs the reaction to happen. The effects produced by the addition of phosphoryl groups that regulate the kinetics of a reaction can be divided in two groups: *Phosphorylation changes the conformation of an enzyme to a more active or inactive way (e.g. regulation of glycogen phosphorylase). Each phosphate group contains two negative charges, so the addition of this group can cause an important change in the conformation of the enzyme. The phosphate can attract positively charged amino acids or create repulsive interactions with negatively charged amino acids. These interactions can change the conformation and the function of the enzyme. When a phosphatase enzyme removes the phosphate groups, this enzyme returns to its initial conformation. *Phosphorylation modifies the affinity of the enzyme to the substrate (e.g. phosphorylation of isocitrate dehydrogenase creates electrostatic repulsion which inhibits the union of the substrate to the active center). Phosphorylation can take place in the active center of the enzyme. It can change the conformation of this active center, so it can recognize the substrate or not. Also, the ionized phosphate can attract some parts of the substrate, which can join to the enzyme. Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation may take place as a result of the response to signals that warn about a change in the cell state. This means that some pathways where regulatory enzymes participate are regulated by phosphorylation after a specific signal: a change in the cell. Some enzymes can be phosphorylated in multiple sites. The presence of a phosphoryl group in a part of a protein may depend on the folding of the enzyme (which can make the protein more or less accessible to kinase proteins) and the proximity of other phosphoryl groups. = Proteolysis = Chymotrypsinogen (the precursor of Chymotrypsin). Painted in red the residue ILE16 and in green the residue ARG15 both involved in the enzyme activation. In dark blue the residue ASP 194 that will later interact with ILE 16. Gamma-Chymotrypsin. In red the residue ILE16 that is now interacting with ASP194, in dark blue. First step of the enzyme activation: the peptide bond ARG15-ILE16 has been hydrolyzed releasing the ILE16 amine, positively charged in physiologic conditions. The amine will strongly interact with the negatively charged radical from ASP194, an ionic bond will be established. Gamma-Chymotrypsin, a complex of Alpha-Chymotrypsin. Images modified from pdb Some enzymes need to go through a maturation process to be activated. A precursor (inactive state, better known as zymogen) is first synthesized, and then, by cutting some specific peptide bonds (enzymatic catalysis by hydrolytic selective split), its 3D conformation is highly modified into a catalytic functional status, obtaining the active enzyme. Proteolysis is irreversible and normally a non-specific process. The same activator can modulate different regulatory enzymes : once trypsin is activated, it activates many other hydrolytic enzymes. Proteolysis can also be fast and simple so the hydrolysis of a single peptide bond can be enough to change the conformation of the protein and build an active zone, allowing the interaction between the enzyme and the substrate, for instance, chymotrypsin activation (as it can be seen in the images). Many different types of proteins with different roles in metabolism are activated by proteolysis for big reasons: *Powerful hydrolytic enzymes, for instance, digestive enzymes, are activated by proteolysis so we can ensure that they are unable to hydrolyze any unwilling protein until they get to the right place: hydrolyzing protein zymogens are synthesized at the pancreas and accumulated in vesicles where they remain harmless. When they are needed, some hormonal or nervous stimulus triggers the release of the zymogens right to the intestine and they are activated. *Some eventual responses must be immediate so enzymes that catalyze those reactions need to be prepared but not active, for that reason a zymogene is synthesized and stays ready for being rapidly activated. Coagulation response is based on enzymatic cascade proteolysis maturation. So, by activating one first catalyzing enzyme a big amount of the following enzymes is activated and the amount of product required is achieved as it is needed. *Connective tissues proteins as collagen (zymogen: procolagen), hormones like insulin (zymogen: proinsulin) and proteins involved in development processes and apoptosis (programmed cell death) are activated by proteolysis too. Proteolysis is irreversible, which implies the need of a process of enzyme deactivation. Specific inhibitors, analogous to the substrate, will strongly join the enzyme, blocking the substrate to join the enzyme. This union may last for months.

They formed in 1982 in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. Steve Walsh had been in the band Kansas and Mike Slamer has been in several other bands, including Britain's City Boy. He was also a session guitarist. Greer and Gehrt were regional players who had seen success with bands in Tennessee and Atlanta, respectively. Gehrt was working with ex-Deep Purple bassist Glenn Hughes when Walsh recruited him for Walsh's first solo effort, Schemer-Dreamer. Walsh had noticed him when one of Gehrt's earlier bands had opened for Kansas. The two became friends and eventually spoke of forming a band together. Slamer had never met Walsh until he showed up for the audition. \\"I decided that I wanted to move to America,\\" says Slamer. \\"The kind of music that I wanted to make wasn't being played at all in England, so I came here.\\" Streets made its debut performance at Charlie Daniels' annual Volunteer Jam in January, 1983. The band played on another band's equipment and only played four songs. The debut LP was released later that year on Atlantic Records. \\"We got out there and proved that we could play,\\" said Walsh. \\"We go out there and we did damn good. We proved to ourselves that we could pull it off and that we were on the right track. Starting over was very humbling. But we got a lot of good feedback to the album. We were playing live every night and being onstage (was) very renewing for us...\\" \\"I wanted to form a democratic band,\\" said Walsh. \\"I did not want to be a solo singer with a band of sidemen.

Polk to John K. Kane outlining his beliefs on tariffs, free trade, and protectionism during his 1844 campaign for President of the United States. Polk's letter contained a polished and succinct statement espousing support for moderate tariff relief. Many historians saw this letter as a \\"masterly straddle\\", but in recent years it has been viewed as Polk's only official position on the contentious and politically divisive tariff issue. His opponent Henry Clay by contrast, produced hundreds of letters and public statements on the tariff, including seemingly contradictory views aimed at different audiences. Clay, a staunch supporter of protectionism, lost support when voters perceived his tariff position to be contradictory and favored Polk's consistent and indeed only position in the Kane letter. Pennsylvania Democrats put Polk's and Clay's views on protectionism side by side. Polk was hailed as a better protectionist due to Clay's mistake of excessive public statements. Upon thinking about the letter at length and the strong stance it took, Polk sent another letter on July 2 to Kane requesting that Kane not publish it. By then it was printed widely and Polk was worried about the dangerous words the letter contained (\\"protection\\" and \\"discrimination\\", used several times within the document). The Whigs used the letter as leverage against Polk, dredging up Polk's old statements strongly opposing tariffs. Polk was subsequently called upon by the Whigs to make a public statement regarding his position on the Tariff of 1842, which he meekly declined. Two members of the United States Senate, George McDuffie and Robert Barnwell Rhett, were furious with the publication of the Kane Letter. McDuffie called for a secession of the South, and threatened raising the \\"Banner of Disunion\\". Franklin H. Elmore, Polk's Public Advisor, quickly took hold of the situation in Charleston, persuading McDuffie and his followers that Polk was \\"a southern man ‚Äì a friend of free trade.\\" Polk was no different from many of the political candidates of that time, appealing to the side he was currently speaking to. James K. Polk was simply a better manipulator of men than Clay and so \\"defeated the ticket\\" in 1844.

He was one of the first African Americans in the United States Congress elected during the Reconstruction Era, and the first black person to be elected to Congress from Florida. He also served four terms in the Florida Senate.  Early life and education  Josiah Walls was born into slavery in 1842 near Winchester, Virginia. During the American Civil War, he was forced to join the Confederate army and work in support. He was captured by the Union Army in 1862 at Yorktown. He voluntarily joined the United States Colored Troops in 1863 and rose to the rank of corporal. He was discharged in Florida and settled in Alachua County, Florida.  Political career  = State government = Walls served as a delegate to the state constitutional convention of 1868, representing Alachua County. Later that year, he was elected to the Florida House of Representatives from Alachua, along with his friend, Henry Harmon, serving in Florida's first Reconstruction Legislature. When State Senator Horatio Jenkins was appointed to a county judgeship, Walls decided to run in the special election to succeed him. He was elected to the Alachua and Levy County district on December 29, 1868, and took office in January. Walls served as state senator for the 1869 and 1870 legislative session.People of Lawmaking in Florida = Congress = In 1870, Walls was nominated as the Republican candidate for Florida's sole at-large congressional seat after a contentious party convention. A moderate faction of mostly white carpetbaggers, led by U.S. Senator Thomas W. Osborn, supported the freedman Robert Meacham, while the majority of black delegates were split between several more radical black candidates, including Walls. Walls won the nomination on the 11th ballot, after the other black candidates withdrew to prevent Meacham from winning. Walls went on to win the 1870 general election and serve in the 42nd Congress, but the vote was contested by Democrat Silas L. Niblack. The House Committee on Elections eventually unseated Walls after finding election irregularities. Walls ran for the at-large congressional seat again in the 1872 election and won. In office, Walls introduced bills to establish a national education fund and aid pensioners and Seminole War Veterans. In 1874, Walls ran for re-election to Congress in the newly redistricted 2nd district. Walls won the election but Democrat Jesse J. Finley, a former Confederate colonel, contested the results of the election. Finley was eventually declared the winner by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives. = Return to state politics = Walls again sought the Republican nomination for the 2nd congressional district in 1876. After the black delegates split between Walls and another black candidate, the nomination went to a ‚Äúwhite carpetbagger‚Äù, Horatio Bisbee. Walls instead ran for his old state senate seat, and served a four-year term. He lost re- election in 1880.  Legal career  Walls was admitted to the bar in Alachua County in April 1873. In June 1874, Walls formed a law partnership in Gainesville with Henry S. Harmon, who had been the first African-American admitted to the bar in Florida, and William U. Saunders. The next year Harmon and Saunders moved their legal practice to Tallahassee.  Later life  Leaving politics, Walls operated a successful farm in Alachua County until the disastrous freeze of 1894‚Äì95, which destroyed his crops. He took a teaching position as Farm Director of the State Normal and Industrial College for Colored Students, which much later would become Florida A&M; University, in Tallahassee. After nearly a decade there, he died on May 5, 1905. See also * List of African-American United States Representatives References Further reading *Klingman, Peter D.

Spearman Whispering Smith (1916 film) Frank Hamilton Spearman (September 6, 1859 ‚Äì December 29, 1937) was an American author. Career overview Spearman was known for his books in the Western fiction genre and especially for his fiction and non-fiction works on the topic of railroads. The books were illustrated by leading artists, such as N. C. Wyeth for Whispering Smith. Although he wrote prolifically about railroads, his actual career was that of a bank president in McCook, Nebraska, and did not himself work for a railroad. Spearman was also a devout Roman Catholic convert and held political views best described as proto-Libertarian, both of which beliefs are also reflected in his novels. His western novel Whispering Smith‚Äîthe title character of which was modeled on real-life Union Pacific Railroad detectives Timothy Keliher and Joe Lefors (though the name of the titular hero was apparently derived from another UPRR policeman, James L. \\"Whispering\\" Smith)‚Äîwas made into a movie on eight separate occasions, four silent films in 1916, 1917, 1926, and 1927, with later versions in 1930, 1935, 1948, and 1952. In 1961, NBC aired twenty episodes of the television series Whispering Smith, starring Audie Murphy in the title role and Guy Mitchell as detective George Romack.\\"Whispering Smith\\", IMDb. Most of his novels have been reprinted frequently. For example, The Paper Tiger press brought out reprints in 1996, complete with the original illustrations.
