It was within the jurisdiction of the former Ashendon Hundred. Brill Palace was founded during the Heptarchy and was used by Edward the Confessor. Henry II visited it at least twice, in 1160 and 1162. In 1203, John granted the manor of Brill to Walter Borstard, his chaplain, at the same time naming Borstard keeper of the palace. Henry III was in residence during 1224; he stayed at Missenden Abbey several times while en route to Brill and is recorded as having rewarded the monks for their hospitality with presents of timber. The manor subsequently passed to Hugh de Neville in 1226 and Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall by 1233. In 1252, a hermitage dedicated to Saint Werburgh was established by Henry III, with the condition that the canons of Chetwode, who were responsible for the endowment, should supply chaplains not only for the hermitage but also for the chapel of Brill Palace. During the English Civil War, a royal garrison held the palace from November 1642 to April 1643, repulsing an attack by parliamentary forces under the command of John Hampden. The ruins of the palace were still visible in 1885, and the site remains a scheduled ancient monument.

Before beginning his career in education, he was a football player at the University of Miami and briefly with the Indianapolis Colts. Education Hamlet attended public schools in Palm Beach County, Florida. In 1992, he earned a bachelor's degree in general studies from the University of Miami, where he was a starting defensive tackle on the Hurricanes' undefeated 1991 National Co-champion football team. The team defeated the Nebraska 22-0 in the 1992 Orange Bowl. He earned two degrees at Nova Southeastern University: a master's in education leadership in 2003 and a doctorate in education in 2007. In 2015, he was a member of the first class at the AASA-Howard University Urban Superintendent Academy, a program intended to train leaders for urban school districts. Career Hamlet was a defensive end on the NFL's Indianapolis Colts in 1993, but did not play in any games. He said he also was a player for the Seattle Seahawks and Winnipeg Blue Bombers for a short time. He began his educational career as a case manager and behavioral specialist with a Palm Beach County mental health unit. He subsequently held positions as teacher, dean of students, assistant principal, principal, and district administrator, mostly with the School District of Palm Beach County. He worked in many different educational settings: urban and suburban, affluent and poverty-stricken, and with high-performing and low- performing schools. In October 2015, the Pittsburgh School Board commissioned a national search for a new superintendent. In January 2016, their independent consultants issued a public call for applicants. Hamlet submitted his application in March, including a five-page resume and several letters of recommendation. Two months later the Pittsburgh school board unanimously voted to hire him as superintendent, with a five-year contract and an annual salary of $210,000. On July 1, 2016, Hamlet took the oath of office as Pittsburgh Public Schools superintendent. Controversies Almost immediately after he was hired, and before he had taken the oath of office, it was uncovered that Hamlet lied on his resume about having turned around two schools from F to C ratings under Florida's state evaluation system. Instead, one school rose from a D to a C, and the other was a C the whole time he was in charge. Of the latter school, state officials acknowledged that test scores did improve slightly, but that the school declined in other areas enough to offset the gains in test scores. After this came out, the school board president and teachers union defended Hamlet, saying that he was needed for his record on turning schools around, despite the fact that it was his claimed record of turning schools around that he had lied about. Pittsburgh Public Schools is reviewing a trip several administrators took to Cuba in April of 2019 without the required approval of the school board. Hamlet and five administrators accepted a trip to Cuba with travel and accommodations paid for by an education consulting group called The Flying Classroom. The trip has raised questions in regard to state ethics laws.\\"Pittsburgh Public Schools to review administrators' trip to Cuba\\"\\"Pittsburgh School Board Solicitor To Conduct In- Depth Investigation Into Unauthorized Cuba Trip\\"\\"Superintendent's trip to Cuba under investigation by Pittsburgh Public Schools solicitor - Dr. Anthony Hamlet and five administrators traveled to Cuba in April without board approval\\" References Year of birth missing (living people) Living people Educators from Florida ","title":"Anthony Hamlet"},{"id":"53681885","text":" ","title":"Panigaon"},{"id":"53681901","text":"Cumminsville is a hamlet and census-designated place in the town of North Dansville, Livingston County, New York, United States.

They describe themselves as a Brotherhood of men who have an appreciation for the outdoors, who are interested in the mystic side of Woodcraft and who have learned that true power comes from self- control.  History  In 1902 Ernest Thompson Seton created the Woodcraft Indians in Cos Cob, Connecticut. Despite the name, it was a group for non- Indian youth. He used the program to teach youth about the importance of nature, personal development and democracy. The program would grow to become a national organization, but in the later years dwindle in membership. In 1912 a book was printed in the form of 100 scrolls. The scrolls are titled The Red Lodge and they were written by Ernest Thompson Seton. By 1917 the Red Lodge went through a name and policy change, it now allowed females to join, and became known as the Sun Lodge. In 1916 Ernest Westlake founded the Order of Woodcraft Chivalry, he appointed Ernest Thompson Seton as the honorary Grand Chieftain. The Order of Woodcraft Chivalry included the Sun Lodge as a type of innermost circle. Audrey Westlake, the son of Ernest is quoted to have described the Sun Lodge as \\"in a sense, the church of the movement\\".  Organization  = The Mother Lodge = The Mother Lodge serves as the Grand Lodge for the Red Lodge organization. It has the right to grant or deny annual charters to all Red Lodges. The Mother Lodge functions the same way as the individual Red Lodges the only difference being its charter granting ability. = Red Lodge = A Red Lodge is the basic unit of membership, it can be formed with the approval of The Mother Lodge and only after a charter has been granted. Three or more men who have achieved the Dibando degree are required to form a new lodge.

Two members of the Lodge need to vouch for his membership. = First Degree = In order to become a Dibando or Brother of the first degree, an individual must first have been found by the Council to be a Mikana. The individual must create a fire by friction thus creating \\"Sacred Fire\\". Next he must be sunburnt to the waist in what is referred to as a \\"Sundance\\". The Mikana will then be instructed to keep a fire going in the wilderness from sunset to sunrise thus completing a \\"Vigil\\". He will then need to read and understand the \\"Four Mystic Rolls\\". The Mikana will then be subjected to a secret vote of the entire Lodge, upon which if found worthy will be installed as a Dibando or \\"Brave of Low Degree\\". = Second Degree = In order to become a Minisino or Brother of the second degree, an individual must have been a Dibando for no less than 4 months. He must memorize 500 words of Native American sign language, and spend 4 days using nothing but signs and writing to communicate. He must also craft a shelter in the wilderness as well as many survival items that can be found in the book The Red Lodge. He must have abstained from a bad habit for a 4-month period. He must fast for a period of 48 hours, alone in a high place. Once installed after passing the Ordeal he is assigned a permanent seat in the Lodge and his shield is hung.

The appointed individual handles all financial dealings of the Lodge including dues, fines and donations. = Keeper of the Tally Roll or Winter Count = This officer serves as a secretary for the Lodge. The Keeper of the Tally Roll is appointed in a similar fashion to the Wumpum-Keeper. This officer is charged with taking minutes during Lodge meetings. The Keeper of the Winter Count is charged with keeping the Painted Robe of Record updated. These two offices may be separate or invested in one individual. = Keeper of the Lodge = The Keeper of the Lodge is appointed in a similar fashion to the Wumpum-Keeper.

These blogs, often produced independently, post pictures of the blogger to show their outfits and lifestyle to a number of followers. They influence consumer taste and preferences, often functioning as an intermediary between businesses and consumer. From a company perspective, the blogger is perceived as a promotional tool. From the consumer side, high-reputation bloggers are considered opinion leaders. This often results in material benefits, rewards, branded fashion clothing and paid sponsorship, as well as status in the field of fashion.  Fashion blogs background  = Beginnings = The first blog created was Links.net in 1994, by Justin Hall, a college student. At this period, Links.net was not referred to as being a blog but rather a personal homepage. It was not until 1997 that the word Weblog was created, by Jorn Barger and in 1999, the word was shortened to Blog, by a programmer called Peter Herholz. During the same year, Pyra Labs introduced Blogger, one of the earliest blog publishing tool. After 1999, bloggers started gaining popularity. A study published by Kaye in 2007 shows that in 1999 about 50 blogs were created, however, it reached an exponential growth and by 2005 about 8 million blogs were recorded.Kaye, B. K. (2007) ‚ÄòBlog Use Motivations: An Exploratory Study‚Äô, in M. Tremayne (ed). Blogging, Citizenship and the Future of Media. New York: Routledge. Also, 27% of all the internet users accessed blog and about 12% have posted a comment or link on those site. The trend of creating and or reading blogs kept on increasing and in 2008, the blogosphere accounted 184 million blogs and 346 million readers. = Evolution = In 2003, Not good For Me, the first Fashion blog, was introduced the web mainstream. Fashion blogging dominated the blogosphere with an unlimited access to social media platform open to anyone. It was around that period, where fashion blogs were becoming popular. According to a Survey conducted by AOL in 2005, 50% of American bloggers used blog as a therapeutic tool against 7.5% who used it for politics purpose. Moreover, a phone survey carried by Pew Internet Project, shows that bloggers used blog as a description of their personal experience. The platform Bloggers have listed more than 2 million as being within the industry of fashion. Therefore, after 2002, the blogosphere was mainly covered by fashion blogs. Starting from that period, fashion bloggers gain importance within the fashion industry, and mainly in playing the role of intermediate between businesses and consumers. Finally, the blogosphere had become a key space for the production, promotion, communication and finally circulation of fashion discourse.  Fashion bloggers trajectory  The fashion system in the early years, was highly restricted and limited to fashion professional. However, the introduction of WEB 2.0, access to information and the falling barrier between cultures, countries, and continent had created a globalization of taste. This recent phenomenon has enable ordinary consumers and fashion professional to reach a mass audience. Therefore, until recently ordinary individuals lacked access to the mass media unless assisted by a professional institution. = From a personal diary to a taste display = Most of the Fashion bloggers, either famous or on the process of being so, will start a blog for a main purpose of posting a daily lifestyle. They start by being constantly connected and ready to answer follower's comments and follower request. As their followers keeps on growing, bloggers enter a stage of Taste display. In this specific stage, bloggers are in a position where their taste is used as a reference for their followers but also as a strategy of differentiation. A blogger acquire taste within the fashion industry through its cultural capital as mentioned by Bourdieu (1999). They exercise taste and make a display of it for public consumption and taste assertion. Therefore, a universally acceptable taste is highly required for a fashion blogger in order to succeed. = From a virtual community to a mass audience = Once the blog has become a well-established taste display space, the blogger starts with a very personal relationship with its followers, and answer their comments as an ordinary participant. However, as soon as the blogger stop answering its follower comments, he or she starts to build an audience and as they start to ignore their followers, their value within the blogosphere increases. This is where the Taste Leadership takes place and provides the bloggers with a mass audience. = From curating to modeling = Most bloggers start their post with a selection and organisation of clothes using software. One software commonly used by bloggers is Polyvore.com. In the beginning of their blogging process, most bloggers barely appear in the pictures. However, as this specific stage of curating becomes redundant, the blogger needs another step to keep followers and provide them with new innovative posts. Therefore, the next stage is modelling. The blogger starts taking the blog seriously and invests in a professional camera in order to take pictures of themselves wearing several outfits that will later be displayed in their blog. In that stage, rather than posting clothing taste, the individual starts developing a professional lifestyle. Therefore, fashion bloggers go from curating to snapshots to modelling. In all three stages, the followers keep increasing. There is an ongoing investment in cultural capital, where not only connections get created but taste also starts improving.  Platforms  Several platforms are used for blogging, ranging from specific blog platform to regular social media platforms. The following list present the some blogging platform used by personal fashion bloggers. * WordPress * Blogger * Tumblr * Wix * Medium * Ghost * Squarespace * Google+  Influential fashion bloggers  Although self-established, fashion bloggers that reach a mass audience gain a significant influence on consumers and thus influence fashion trends each season. These bloggers are called influential bloggers. Fashion magazine Fashionista listed some of the most influential personal fashion bloggers in 2016, the most notable being: * Chiara Ferragni, The Blonde Salad * Aimee Song, Song of Style * Julia Engel, Gal Meets Glam * Danielle Bernstein, We Wore What * Julie Sari√±ana, Sincerely Jules * Blair Eadie, Atlantic-Pacific Other notable fashion/lifestyle bloggers with large, engaged followings on social media include: * Sarah Tripp, Sassy Red Lipstick * Rachel Parcell, Pink Peonies * Courtney Quinn, Color Me Courtney * Amber Fillerup, Barefoot Blonde * Cara Loren, Cara Loren * Christine Andrew, Hello Fashion Blog  Fashion bloggers outcomes  Several incentives influence bloggers passion and enthusiasm towards their blogging activities. The two main incentive which are economical and social were discussed by McQuarrie, Edward F., Miller, Jessica, Philips and Barbara J. and are listed below. = Economical = There are several form of economical rewards. The most common ones are Branded Fashion clothing, paid ad-placement, and paid sponsorship of their blog contest. This process enables them to become a key promotional tool for brand. Those rewards vary from small bloggers to large and influential bloggers. = Social = Using Bourdieu's idea of cultural capital, McQuarrie, Edward F., Miller, Jessica, Philips and Barbara J. have developed two sociological explanations to personal style bloggers social outcome: Taste of Judgement and Accumulation of cultural capital. Once they reach a mass audience and become famous, those personal fashion bloggers acquire a higher social mobility within the social strata of the fashion industry. For instance, many of them receive invitations to exclusive parties, Designer open houses, charity appearance mentioned in the media and so on. All these access to fashion professional, provide them with networking opportunity, helping them increase their social mobility. Therefore, a fashion blogger success comes from joining the traditional fashion system, rather than disconnecting it from it.  Impact on the fashion industry  Personal style bloggers have the potential to alter and confront the social norms constructed within the fashion industry. Fashion platforms allow for bloggers to freely express themselves and are not subject to the restricted binaries the fashion media content. Personal style bloggers can differentiate themselves from mainstream fashion, by cultivating and broadcasting their styles outside of the influence of advertisers and large corporations. Therefore, personal style bloggers have more freedom to showcase their fashion and potentially disrupt the industry illustration of trends. Becoming a profitable full-time fashion blogger is very difficult, as the ability to generate revenue through consulting and advertisements is very inconsistent, resulting in may fashion bloggers to pursue it as an activity. Although, the individuals who decide to self-brand themselves rely on social media and other platforms to build a brand and gain relationships with followers. Social media, therefore, majorly contribute to the impact personal styles have on the fashion industry. = Gay personal style bloggers = Previously, fashion was seen as more feminine than masculine, so when the male fashion industry started to develop, it tried to distance itself from femininity as much as possible, and one of the ways this was done was by excluding gay men from the demographic it was trying reach. Men's fashion tends to showcase dominant masculine ideals, and although the industry has now accepted gay men, the style still tends to follow the typical heteronormative ideals. Personal style blogs have allowed for homosexual men to include themselves back into the fashion world and gave them a platform to express themselves. This allows for a larger, more diverse representation of male style outside of the trends depicted in the traditional fashion industry. Within the Fashion industry, gender is constructed into a fixed idea of what individual's appearance should be. These structured guidelines formed by society are largely enforced by the fashion industry to regulate what is deemed acceptable, thus, emphasizing the ideal ‚Äòheterosexual man‚Äô. As a result, personal style bloggers attempt to break these gender binaries representing society's idea of masculinity. Moreover, personal style bloggers can differentiate themselves from print fashion representation, through personal takes on contemporary looks. As male models are continuously depicted in an unachievable way, fashion bloggers can present an alternative to the fashion industries typical portrayal of men. They offer different representation concerning height, weight, and physical appearance. This ends up promoting inclusivity in the fashion industry and allows for a more substantial demographic to relate to their content. See also *fast fashion  References  * *Mohr, I. (2013).

CBC News Montreal, April 3, 2017. A member of the Liberal Party of Canada, she was elected to the House of Commons in a by-election, succeeding St√©phane Dion. A 26-year-old teacher from Rosemount High School at the time of her election, she won the Liberal nomination in an upset, defeating former provincial immigration minister Yolande James and future Liberal MNA Marwah Rizqy.  Early life  Lambropoulos was born on September 12, 1990 and was raised in the Saint-Laurent borough of Montr√©al. She attended Gardenview elementary school, LaurenHill Academy high school and Vanier College, where she received the Program Award upon graduation, awarded in recognition of outstanding achievement in the Social Science (Psychology Major) Program. She then graduated from McGill University with a Bachelor of Education in 2013, where she was the president of the McGill Hellenic Students Association. She then became a teacher at Rosemount High School, where she taught French and history.  Political career  Born and raised in Saint-Laurent, Emmanuella Lambropoulos has been proudly representing the people of the riding she calls home in the House of Commons since she was elected in the 2017 by-election. Upon graduating from McGill University in 2013, Emmanuella began her teaching career teaching History, Geography and Ethics and Religious Culture at various high schools on the island, including at Saint-Laurent's very own LaurenHill Academy, where she also worked as a resource aid with students who had learning disabilities and autism. She completed her Masters of Arts in Educational Leadership in 2020. Throughout her years as an educator, Emmanuella became passionate about social change and entered politics to help make Canada a fairer place for all. An advocate for equality, inclusion and diversity, Emmanuella would be honoured to continue representing her home riding of Saint-Laurent as of October 2019. The seat in Saint-Laurent became available after the incumbent MP, St√©phane Dion, announced he would be leaving politics in January 2017, following a cabinet shuffle in which he lost his portfolio as foreign affairs minister. Lambropoulos had previously volunteered on Dion's team. Lambropoulos won the Liberal nomination on March 8, 2017 in an upset against the presumed candidate, Yolande James. James had previously been a provincial cabinet minister with strong ties to the Liberal party; however, she came in third place. Another likely candidate, Alan DeSousa, was not included on the ballot at all after being turned down by the Liberal Party. Lambropoulos's campaign was described as ‚Äúgrassroots‚Äù with strong support from local ethnic communities, including the Greek community to which she belongs. Her campaign began in her grandmother's living room and originally consisted of only Lambropoulos herself and her father. She was officially elected as an MP in the Saint-Laurent by-election on April 3, 2017 with 59.1% of votes. Lambropoulos has served on the parliamentary committees for Veterans Affairs (May 2017-Sept 2018), Status of Women (Sept 2017-Sept 2019), and Official Languages (Sept 2018-Sept 2019). Her most frequently-discussed topics in Parliament are disabilities and the status of women. As part of her work for the Status of Women committee, she has studied such issues as shelters and transition homes for women who are seeking to escape domestic violence, and barriers to women entering politics. On the Official Languages committee, she advocates for anglophones as the minority language in Qu√©bec. https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/opinion-next-census-offers-a-chance-to- defend-english-schools In the 1st session of the 43rd Parliament, she served as a member on the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grocery-store-executives-testify-industry- committee-pandemic-pay-1.5645018 she was re-elected on October 21, 2019, earning 58.9% of the vote.

In their letter, they also pointed out a breach of Lambropoulos' ethics, as \\"two members on the executive are employed in the county office, which would seem to put you in contravention of the rules of the House of Commons\\". Indeed, Nouvelles Saint-Laurent, a local newspaper, notes that the Manual of Allowances and Services for Members of Parliament clearly states that MPs \\" cannot hire members of the executive of political parties to work in their parliamentary or constituency offices\\". Following the tabling of the state secularism bill, Lambropoulos wrote on Facebook comparing the bill to segregation. Mr. Blanchet, leader of the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois, invited his colleague and the federal government to respect Quebecers. \\"We can see that this reveals the deep nature of the [Liberal Party of Canada], which is hostile to Quebec identity, which is hostile to Quebec's secularism. I would remind Mr. Trudeau that the current government has been in power for six months and that in six months, it may not be here anymore,\\" Mr. Blanchet replied. The minister responsible for the State Secularism Act, Mr. Simon Jolin-Barrette, replied: \\"I don't think the bill on secularism can be compared in any way to any dark period in the history of humanity. It does not contribute to the debate to have extreme comparisons like this. I think the bill that is being tabled by the government is a moderate bill that brings Quebeckers together\\". During the federal election, Nouvelles Saint-Laurent spoke with the New Democratic Party candidate in Saint-Laurent, Miranda Gallo, who wrongfully criticized the attitude of the outgoing MP, Lambropoulos, towards support for minorities. \\"The borough of Saint-Laurent has the third largest Arab population in Canada. Their interests are important here. She doesn't care,\\" deplores Gallo. However, it was found that Lambropoulos consistently defends minority communities, and her support for religious minorities was made clear when she stood against Bill 21, the Bill on secularism that targeted certain religious groups more than others, at several rallies. In a speech she gave at one of the rallies, ‚Äúpart of which was also on her Facebook page, Lambropoulos said Bill 21 is ‚Äúdiscriminatory and takes away the rights of so many people who make up our Canadian and Quebec society.‚Äù Furthermore, because Saint-Laurent has a large Arab population, Lambropoulos offers services in Arabic through her riding office. In October 2019, Lambropoulos was once again criticized for her ethics. Several former members of the Youth Council denounced the unhealthy proximity between this non-partisan body, the Liberal riding association and the Liberal MP's office. Saint-Laurent News discovered that Mr. Amara Kaba \\"held the position of president of the two organizations in addition to being a subcontractor for Lambropoulos' office\\" and \\"another employee of the firm was allegedly simultaneously on the Council and the CDA\\". A former member was also anonymously quoted for saying that \\"it was the former president and the president who decided a lot of things\\" and Mr. Kaba also explained that the Liberal MP \\"attended all of our meetings, sometimes suggested events, projects that we could do [for the benefit of the community] and validated ours\\". Lambropoulos is said to have helped the Centre communaut√© Bon courage, an organization that offers services to the riding's neediest families, obtain a total grant of $37,000 from the Canada Summer Jobs program. Following her intervention, this organization succeeded in hiring 12 people, including five animation positions at Painter Park, following a joint job offer with Lambropoulos' Youth Council.

He is an emeritus professor in the Department of Sociology at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, where he was research professor of communications, College of Communications scholar, professor of sociology, professor of cinema studies, professor in the Unit for Criticism and Interpretive Theory. Denzin's academic interests include interpretive theory, performance studies, qualitative research methodology, and the study of media, culture and society. Education and career Denzin received his Ph.D. from the University of Iowa in 1966, and joined the Sociology Department at Illinois in the same year. Later in his career, he moved to the College of Communication and founded the International Institute for Qualitative Inquiry there. Denzin, is regarded as \\"the Father of Qualitative Research\\" due to (1) the scope of his scholarly impact on qualitative inquiries, (2) integration of scholarship to advance the mission of qualitative research, and (3) continuous efforts in nurturing the field of qualitative research via editorship and conference organization. His organizational efforts have included founding the annual International Congress for Qualitative Research in 2005, the creation of three qualitative research journals (Qualitative Inquiry, Cultural Studies- Critical Methodologies, in International Review of Qualitative Research), and book series for Sage, AltaMira, Left Coast, Emerald, Routledge, and other publishers. He is also a leading scholar in the fields of symbolic interactionism, social psychology, and social science, has influenced a wide spectrum of perspectives. Denzin possesses an extensive and diverse record of publications that are still evolving, especially, in the areas such as symbolic interactionism, semiotics, cultural studies, postmodernism, ethnography, performance studies, etc.Chen, S-L (2002). \\"Cultural Studies and Symbolic Interactionism: NCA Spotlight on the Contributions of Norman Denzin\\" in Studies in Symbolic Interaction: A Research Annual. Volume 25. p. 153-156. =Qualitative research= Since 1970 Denzin has been working on qualitative research methods. He published the book The Research Act: A Theoretical Introduction to Sociological Methods in 1970 and edited the book Readings in Social Psychology and Social Psychology with Lindesmith and Strass in 1975. The Handbook of Qualitative Research, co-edited with Yvonna Lincoln in 1994, has gone through four subsequent editions (2000, 2005, 2011, 2017) and is considered the primary reference volume in the field. Denzin as a co-editor (1998a, 1998b, 1998c, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2006, 2007, 2008a, 2008b, 2008c, 2009a, 2010a, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2017a, and 2017b) or sole author (2009b 2010b, 2017c) has been continuously advancing the theoretical knowledge of qualitative research and developing strategies for application practices. From The Research Act in 1970, On Understanding Emotion in 1984, Interpretive Biography in 1989, to Interpretive Ethnography in 1997, Denzin addressed the role of the researcher, the research activities, and the relationships with the researched. According to Denzin, research should be rooted in the community where the research takes place, and should be participant oriented. Clifford Christians, Sandage Distinguished Professor of Communications at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, noted that Denzin provides an alternative approach from utilitarian rationalism in the discussion of communication ethics.Christians, C. (2002). Norman Denzin's Feminist Communitarian Ethics, Studies In Symbolic Interaction: A Research Annual, Volume 25, p. 167-176. Denzin led the field of qualitative research with vision and foresight. In 1997, he published Interpretive Ethnography: Ethnographic Practices for the 21st Century, in which he calls for a transformation of ethnographic research to meet the new prospect and address upcoming problems in a globalized new age facilitated by advance technologies. Denzin argues that while exploring new types of experimental texts, performance-based texts, literary journalism and narratives of the self in the postmodern world, ethnographers need to pay attention to communication ethics. His own work has reflected this, using staged readings, magical realism, imagined conversation, and poetry over expository prose. In the 21st century, Denzin articulates qualitative research to critical pedagogy by publishing the book Performance Ethnography: The Politics and Pedagogies of Culture (2003). In his work The Qualitative Manifesto: A Call to Arms (2010) Denzin engages the qualitative research in social justice inquiry, and further encourages ethnographers to be sensitive to identity and indigenous concerns. H. L. (Bud) Goodall, Jr., an American scholar of human communication, praised Denzin as a leading qualitative researcher and stated, : \\"I have long admired Norm Denzin's vision and passion for qualitative inquiry. But I have never seen him write with such raw, energizing power - his is the voice of a fine angry angel leading us into the political battle of narratives currently defining, and contesting, qualitative research. It's a perfect pitch for this manifesto that is really a full intellectual and performative call to arms.‚Ä≥Denzin, N. (2010). The Qualitative Manifesto: A Call to Arms. book back cover. New York: Routeledge. : =Symbolic interactionism, social psychology= In the 1970s, Denzin established himself as a scholar in symbolic interactionism with the publications of two works, The Research Act: A Theoretical Introduction to Sociological Methods (1970), and Childhood Socialization: Studies in Language, Interaction and Identity (1977). The Research Act, which presents the symbolic-interactionist, interpretive approach to research methods, was deemed as a major contribution to sociological theory. Herbert Blumer (1900-1987), a leading American sociologist in symbolic interactionism, believed that The Research Act is \\"A first class work. It should have a revolutionary impact on social research‚Äîindeed on the entire scientific enterprise in the social psychology sciences.\\" Denzin, N. (2009). The Research Act: A Theoretical Introduction to Sociological Methods. book back cover. New York: Aldine Transaction. In Childhood Socialization, Denzin explores child development from the perspectives of social psychology to re-address the definition of childhood. He recommends a new definition that recognizes children as individuals seeking meaning for their own actions, in which language plays a key role for them to develop a sense of self. Denzin demonstrates how children enter into a process of sequential development that leads to self-awareness, socialized abilities and attributes such as pride, dignity, and poise. In his book Interpretive Interactionism (1989), Denzin provides a new approach to qualitative research by integrating symbolic interactionism, hermeneutics, feminism, post-modernism and critical-biographical studies with qualitative studies. In this new approach, Denzin gives attentions to the subjective, the biographical, and experimental voices. Subsequently, autoethnography and performance ethnography became a major intellectual movement in the 1990s. In 1992, Denzin sensed the need to expand the scope of symbolic interactionist inquiry by incorporating cultural studies. In Symbolic Interactionism and Cultural Studies: The Politics of Interpretation (1992), Denzin attempted to formulate an interactionist cultural studies that would expand the scope of the micro social/interactionist inquiry to include the macro cultural/critical aspects. James W. Carey applauded Denzin's effort of integrating symbolic interactionism and cultural studies. Carey also advised that to formulate an interactionist cultural studies, one must fill the space between symbolic and interaction with the analysis of communication and culture.Carey, J. (2002). \\"Cultural Studies and Symbolic Interactionism: Notes in Critique and Tribute to Norman Denzin\\" in Studies In Symbolic Interaction: A Research Annual. Volume 25. p. 199-210. Denzin turned his gaze further on cinematic race relations, and published Reading Race: Hollywood and a Cinema of Racial Violence, 1980-1995 in 2002. In this book, Denzin examines the relationship between film, race and culture. Denzin seeks to provide an understanding of the politics of race and the symbolic complexity of segregation and discrimination. David Altheide, an American sociologist, complemented Denzin's works in cinema studies. According to Altheide, Denzin successfully integrates cinema with culture, discourse and consciousness. Altheide believes that Denzin's cinema studies provide a new paradigm and a new methodology with an aim to understanding social life. Altheide indicates that by providing in- depth readings of films, Denzin crusades for social justice.Altheide, D. (2002). \\"Reflections on Media Meanings in Denzin's Work\\" in Studies In Symbolic Interaction: A Research Annual. Volume 25. p. 157-166. =Semiotics/structuralism/postmodernism= Denzin expanded his qualitative research to include semiotics and cinema studies. Based on a detailed critical reading of thirty-seven films produced between 1932 and the end of the 1980s, Denzin published Hollywood Shot by Shot: Alcoholism and American Cinema in 1991. From a historical and diachronic approach, Denzin identifies five periods in films dealing with alcoholism, through which Denzin demonstrates how feature films shape the meanings of alcoholism, and how films are shaped by a broad societal discourse, and how cultural texts signify and lend themselves to interpretation within a social nexus. Roger Ebert, American film critic and historian, praised Denzin's work, stating, \\"Denzin has gone on an exhaustive bar-crawl through hundreds of movies, returning with evidence that the film about drinking is a genre of its own. He writes from sound knowledge about alcoholism--which, unlike other diseases, is frequently viewed with bittersweet romanticism.‚ÄùDenzin, N. (2004). Hollywood Shot by Shot: Alcoholism in American Cinema. book back cover. New York: Aldine Transaction. Denzin's works in semiotics, structuralism and cinema studies led him to further incorporate postmodernism and post-structuralism in his repertoire as a cultural critic. In Images of Postmodernism: Social Theory and Contemporary Cinema (1991), Denzin explores the tension between postmodernism and traditional social theory by analyzing several Hollywood movies. Denzin utilizes ideas embedded in postmodernism, poststructuralism, feminism, cultural studies and Marxism to address issues associated with the self and the society. Lawrence Grossberg, an American scholar in cultural studies, applauded Denzin's effort, and stated, : ‚Ä≥Norman Denzin, one of the most interesting theorists and ethnographers in American sociology, has turned his critical eye to postmodern theory and contemporary American culture and society. Revitalizing Mills' sociological imagination, Denzin addresses the relations between Hollywood films of the 1980s, their constructions of self, and the structures of lived experience. He offers a postmodern sociology which addresses the increasingly conservative basis of postmodern ideologies of race, class and gender. It offers an original postmodern critique of the postmodern. Images of Postmodern Society should be and will be widely read and discussed.‚Ä≥Denzin, N. (1991). Images of Postmodernism: Social Theory and Contemporary Cinema. book back cover. New York: Sage. =Social science= In 1984, Denzin published On Understanding of Emotion. In this book, Denzin provides new perspectives. Denzin criticizes inaccurate conceptions of emotionally disturbed people without paying attentions to their inner lives and the ways they relate to others. He suggests that researchers need to examine not only human emotions in joy, pain, love, hate, anger, despair, friendship and alienation, but also the personal, psychological, social and cultural aspects involved in human emotions. In the work The Alcoholic Self (1987), Denzin provides a theoretical foundation by analyzing the lived experience of the active alcoholic. He asserts that alcoholism is a disease in which alcoholic intoxication develops inner negative emotions and distorts personalities, and offers recommendation of the treatment process, including restructuring self, interacting with recovery treatment program, and the self- transcendence, etc. Denzin further incorporated justice studies and social activism in qualitative research, and published a co-edited volume, with Yvonna Lincoln, 9/11 in American Culture (2003). In this volume, Denzin and Lincoln gathered a number of leading cultural studies and interpretive qualitative researches to address varied emotional and critical responses to September 11, a cataclysmic event, and provide suggestions on how to make sense of this tragic event, what the place of the humanities and the social sciences might hold in an age of terror, and so forth. Since 2008, Denzin has focused on the treatment of Native Americans, their culture and art, in a series of four books (2008a, 2011, 2013, 2015). From the perspectives of critical cultural studies, Denzin and Michael Giardina co-edited a book Contesting Empire, Globalizing Dissent: Cultural Studies after 9/11 in 2006. In this volume, the leading scholars from cultural studies, education, gender studies, and sociology, address the goal of moral clarity and political intervention after 9/11 by analyzing the governing strategies of the military, economic, media, and educational elites around the world. Awards and honors Denzin received many honors for his works, including Lifetime Achievement Award, presented by International Association of Qualitative Inquiry in 2009, Clifford G. Christians Ethics Research Award for Interpretive Ethnography (1997) presented by the Carl Couch Center for Social and Internet Research in 2006, the Norman K. Denzin Qualitative Research Award established by the Carl Couch Center in 2002, George Herbert Mead Award presented by the Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction in 1997, and Cooley Award for The Alcoholic Self (1987) presented by the Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction in 1988. Selected publications Denzin is the author, co- author, or co-editor of more than 50 books and 200 professional articles and chapters. Works with a longevity of continuous editions include The Research Act (since 1970), Sociological Methods: A Sourcebook (since 1970), and Social Psychology, and Readings in Social Psychology, (the latter two are co-edited since 1975). * 2017a: Qualitative Inquiry in Neoliberal Times (Eds. with Michael D.

Guns salvaged from scrapped ships found a second life on river gunboats of the Soviet Navy during the Russian Civil War and as coastal artillery and railway artillery during World War II. In 1941 it was estimated that there were 196 guns (82 in the Baltic, 70 in the Pacific, 37 in the Black sea and 7 in the Northern fleet) still in use as coastal artillery. After independence in 1917 Finland was estimated to have inherited 100 guns and some remained in use until the 1980s. The last was decommissioned in 2003. History In 1891 a Russian naval delegation was shown three guns designed by the French designer Canet. One was a 75/50 gun caliber gun, one was a 120/45 gun, and the last was a 152/45 gun. All three guns used fixed QF ammunition which produced a rate of fire of 15 rpm for the 75/50 gun, 12 rpm for the 120/45 gun and 10 rpm for the 152/45 gun. The Russians were impressed and in 1892 they negotiated a production license for all three guns. In practice the rate of fire of 10 rpm was hard to achieve due to difficulties with ammunition handling. The practical rate of fire varied by class of ship from a low of 2 rpm in the Petropavlovsk-class battleships, to a high of 7 rpm in single deck mounted guns. In 1901 the fixed ammunition was changed to separate loading QF cased charge and projectile. Construction There were two main series of the 152/45 guns produced. The first series of guns were constructed of a thick A tube, a long B tube and jacket. 215 of the first series of guns were built between 1897‚Äì1901, 181 at the Obhukov factory and 37 at the Perm factory. During the Russo-Japanese war a number of gun barrels burst in action and a strengthened series of 133 guns were produced, 21 at the Obhukov factory and 112 at the Perm factory between 1909‚Äì1918. The strengthened series of guns had a thinner A tube reinforced with three sections of B tube and a jacket which was long. Naval Use The 152/45 guns armed the majority of armored cruisers, pre-dreadnought battleships and protected cruisers of the Imperial Russian Navy built between 1890‚Äì1916.

Finnish use As Finland became independent the northern half of the coastal fortifications in Imperial Russian Peter the Great's Naval Fortress fell in to Finnish hands mostly intact. The coastal guns included about 100 pieces of the 152 mm 45 caliber Canet guns and this type became the primary coastal gun of its class in Finland. It was given a designation of 152/45 C. There was considerable variation between the guns as they included both naval and army coastal gun models from different years. There were also different gun mountings used with about 70 guns on taller coastal gun mountings but the remaining 30 guns were on lower ship deck mounts with lower maximum elevation and range. Finnish coastal artillery made modifications to the gun mountings during the interwar period. The most significant of these was inverting the gun so that the recuperating springs were on top of the gun which allowed increasing the maximum elevation and thus the range. Inverting the gun however required also strengthening the recuperator, adding an equilibrator to correct the changed balance and other changes to the mounting and elevation mechanism. Increased maximum elevation also allowed using the gun as an anti-aircraft weapon. To increase maximum range even more the ammunition for the guns was modified by adding a ballistic cap to existing ammunition which increased the range by a factor of 1.5. Additionally Finns changed the gun loading practice to allow reloading without the need to return the gun to zero elevation after each shot. This practice increased the rate of fire. During World War II 152/45 C was the de facto Finnish standard coastal gun with 95 guns in the inventory at the beginning of 1939. During Winter War coastal batteries equipped with the gun defended against Soviet Navy attacks before the sea was frozen. The guns also provided important artillery support for the Finnish army: at both ends of the Mannerheim line were coastal batteries equipped with 152/45 C guns, and their role was important given the Finnish lack of field artillery. Other coastal batteries in the northern part of Lake Ladoga also supported land battles, and later in the war coastal forts in Gulf of Vyborg and Kotka participated in the fighting. 18 guns were lost during the war, most when the coastal forts had to abandoned. 76 guns remained in use after Winter War. During the Interim Peace Finland began constructing Salpa Line to fortify the new border to replace Mannerheim Line fortifications. Salpa Line artillery included six 152/45 C guns. In the Continuation War 152/45 C was involved in the fighting again and several guns were lost to barrel explosions or simply worn out. Some guns lost in the Winter War were recaptured bringing the total to 78 pieces in 1943. By 1 May 1944 the number had dropped to 60. During World War II 152/45 C guns were also used as anti-aircraft guns. The guns, designed originally before aircraft had been invented, were not especially effective in this role even after the modifications that had been done. Despite the limitations they were used against enemy bomber formations, especially in the defense of Helsinki and also against fighters. Finland also used 152/45 C guns as railway guns. The first trials with a 152/45 C gun mounted in a railway wagon in Finland was performed in 1924 and the gun was given the designation of 152/45 CRaut. Winter War mobilization plans called for two gun railway battery, but due to equipment problems only a single gun was available for most of the war. In Continuation War the battery was expanded to four guns. On 21.9.1941 the battery was renamed as 2nd railway battery after 1st railway battery had been formed from captured Soviet 180 mm railway guns. The battery was disbanded and the guns removed from the railway wagons after the war, but the plans for re- forming it remained in place. In 1962 there were three guns reserved for forming a railway artillery battery. After the Continuation War ended with Moscow Armistice Allied Control Commission demanded that all coastal guns larger than 120 mm in calibre east of Porkkala had to be removed and placed in storage. This included the coastal fortifications around Porkkala, fortifications of the capital Helsinki (18 152 mm guns) and the Kotka-Hamina area forts (17 152/45 C guns). This restriction was lifted in 1947 after signing of the Paris Peace Treaty. 152/45 C guns were badly worn out after the war, and several had cracked or broken barrels. An investigation of the barrel failures concluded that the guns could not withstand the pressures created by the gunpowder used. This led to a development of a new light weight high explosive shell which could be fired by a half-charge of gunpowder. The worn out gun barrels were replaced with newly developed 50 caliber 152 50 Tampella barrels. =152 50 Tampella= 152 50 Tampella Already near the end of the World War II Tampella company was ordered to construct new gun barrels for 152/45 C guns. Due to the end of the war this did not happen, but in the early 1950s there was again available funds to start modernizing the guns. Tampella barrel was longer than the original at 50 calibers and it had different, progressive rifling with 48 deep grooves instead of the original constant 38 deep grooves. Due to these changes the modernized gun could not use the ammunition of the original guns and new ammunition was developed for it using cartridge cases. The maximum range of the modernized gun was . The new barrels were also equipped with muzzle brakes. The new guns were given the designation 152 50 T and they started equipping coastal batteries in 1959. A total of 29 guns were built. In 1960s concern for the vulnerability of fixed guns against napalm led to adding a protective metal cupola for the guns. An overpressurization system was also fitted. The cupola was built of thin metal and provided only very limited armour protection against small shrapnel. Smaller changes to the gun mounting were also made, including replacing the recoil springs. The modernized guns replaced older 152/45 C guns but some original models remained in less important positions. Bolax battery is unique where the cupola armour was fitted but the guns themselves were not modernized. By the 1980s the 152 50 T was in turn being replaced with 130 53 TK and they were withdrawn from service in 2003. Ammunition Early ammunition was of Fixed QF type while later ammunition was of Separate QF. The projectiles weighed and the charge weighed .

Several dozen people were killed in the two fires. Ships Alva Cape was built at the Greenock Dockyard Company. She was launched on May 15, 1953, and was delivered in September of the same year. She was long, with a beam of , and a draft of , and measured 11,252 GRT and 16,590 DWT. Her propulsion was a single diesel engine that gave her a service speed of . At the time of her loss, she was owned by the Alva Steamship Company and under charter to Esso. Texaco Massachusetts was built at the Bethlehem Sparrows Point Shipyard. She was launched on September 20, 1962, and was delivered in January 1963. She was long, with a beam of , and measured 16,516 GRT and 25,728 DWT. She was powered by a single steam turbine that gave her a service speed of . At the time of the collision, she was owned by Domestic Tankers. After the 1966 incident, she returned to service and operated until September 1995, when she was scrapped at Alang, India. First fire On June 16 at about 14:30 local time, Alva Cape was moving westward through Kill Van Kull with a cargo of of naphtha, inbound from India. Texaco Massachusetts was outbound in ballast, bound for Port Arthur, Texas, and was turning into the channel from Newark Bay when she collided with Alva Cape on the latter ship's starboard side at the west end of Kill Van Kull, just west of the Bayonne Bridge. At the time of the collision, Texaco Massachusetts was being aided by the tugboat Latin American, while Alva Cape had the tug Esso Vermont alongside. Immediately after the collision, Texaco Massachusetts began to back away, allowing naphtha to spill from Alva Cape and ignite, likely from the engine of Esso Vermont. A crew member from Texaco Massachusetts later testified that the master of his ship, Captain Richard Pinder, had ordered fire hoses deployed to spray foam, but only one had worked. The following fire burned until about 22:35, when firefighters from fireboats and the Staten Island fire department extinguished it. In addition to fireboats, small craft from the police department and Coast Guard were dispatched to the scene, along with seven tugboats. Estimates of the number people aboard the four ships involved in the collision varied, ranging from 96 to 104. At least 60 people were hospitalized, about 40 of whom were released within two days. By the day after the fire, 21 people had been confirmed dead, including eight of the nine crew of Esso Vermont, with eleven missing. After continued searching failed to locate the missing, they were declared lost and the death toll was officially raised to 32 on June 19. Another person later died, bringing the final toll to 33. Following the fire, Texaco Massachusetts sailed for Todd Shipyards in Brooklyn, while Alva Cape was grounded off of Bergen Point, New Jersey where preparations to unload the rest of her cargo were begun. She was later moved to anchor off Gravesend, Brooklyn for removal of the naphtha by salvers Merritt-Chapman & Scott. Esso Vermont was towed to Shooters Island, and Latin American was towed to a Staten Island shipyard. Both tankers were insured at Lloyd's of London, which said that the value of the policy on Texaco Massachusetts was $7 million and that of Alva Cape was $1.4 million. =Aftermath= Investigation On June 17, the Coast Guard opened its investigation into the collision, with the first public meeting occurring on the 20th. It took place at the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House, and was led by Rear Admiral William Ellis, with Captain Wilbur Doe and Commander Forrest Stewart, all of the Guard's Eastern Area, filling the other spots on the board of inquiry. On July 18, the pilot of Alva Cape at the time of the collision, Donald Baker, was charged by the Coast Guard with negligence; Baker disputed the charge, having testified that Texaco Massachusetts had caused the collision when she changed course unexpectedly. Previous testimony by Texaco Massachusetts crewmembers indicated that the tanker had been in the process of turning when she collided with Alva Cape, although accounts differed as to whether she had been turning to port or starboard. Baker was charged with four counts of negligence--that he had not used caution in navigation, that he had not yielded to another ship, that he had not reduced speed when approaching another ship, and that he had not sounded a danger signal. His hearing was adjourned until September to allow time to prepare a defense. On September 12, eight further charges of negligence relating to Baker's actions after the collision were brought, and his hearing was therefore delayed again until the end of September. On August 3, pilot Patrick Kelly, who was in command of Texaco Massachusetts, was charged with four counts of negligence--failure to use caution in navigating, failure as a \\"privileged vessel\\" to maintain course and speed, failure to sound a danger signal, and failure to sound a signal indicating his ship was reversing. His hearing was likewise delayed until September. On September 13, Kelly, by then charged with eight counts of negligence, entered a denial of all charges. During the course of the Coast Guard's investigation, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) was founded on April 1, 1967, and given responsibility for finding the cause of and reporting on transportation accidents, and the final report was therefore issued by the NTSB on October 16, 1967. It found that both pilots Baker and Kelly had failed to use the required caution when in command of their vessels, though Alva Cape was primarily at fault as she had been required to yield to Texaco Massachusetts under the rules of the sea. Legal action On June 22, three companies filed competing suits in district court. Alva Steamship Company filed a petition for exoneration of liability, saying that Alva Cape had been seaworthy and appropriately crewed and that Texaco Massachusetts and her accompanying tugboat had been responsible for the collision. Domestic Tankers filed a $300,000 suit against Humble Oil, owner of Esso Vermont and Alva Cape's cargo. Humble Oil filed a competing $750,000 suit against Domestic, alleging that Texaco Massachusetts and Latin American were at fault as a result of failures of navigation. On June 24, Alva Steamship Company filed a new $2 million suit against Texaco Massachusetts, Domestic Tankers, and operator Texaco, claiming that Texaco Massachusetts and her crew were at fault. This was followed on the 27th by an $8 million injury suit filed on behalf of 32 Texaco Massachusetts crewmembers, each seeking $250,000, against Domestic Tankers, Texaco, Alva Steamship Company, Alva's manager Navigation and Coal Trade Company, and Humble Oil. Second fire On June 28, Alva Cape caught fire at anchor in Gravesend Bay while the last of the naphtha still on board was being removed. A series of explosions at 15:49 triggered the fire, which was controlled in about an hour, though fireboats remained on the scene to spray foam into the ship until late in the evening. Four people were killed in the explosions and fire, and nine were injured. The fire was responded to by police and fire boats, tugs, and helicopters. After the fire was extinguished, the Coast Guard ordered Alva Cape's hold flooded with inert gas or salt water to prevent further fire, and Mayor John Lindsay ordered the wrecked ship to be removed from the harbor. On the afternoon of June 29, the Coast Guard ordered Alva Cape to be out of the harbor within 24 hours, later extended to 48 hours when Alva Steamship Company and its agent, Navcot, were unable to obtain towing. =Cause= New York City Fire Department Chief John O'Hagan said that the explosions had been triggered by heat and the mixing of naphtha with oxygen. During the investigation into the fire, Captain Frederick Zickl, who had been working on the unloading of the ship, said that the Fire Department had needlessly interfered in the process and criticized the decision to pump carbon dioxide into the ship; it was considered a possibility that the addition of carbon dioxide caused explosive gases to rise in the hold until they contacted hot steel plating. O'Hagan said that the fire department had only specified that an inert gas be used, and said that the salvage operation had been proceeding too slowly and had allowed naphtha to spill into the water. The investigation into the fire was led by Coast Guard Lieutenant Commander Robert Burke, who issued his report on March 8, 1967 and found that the unloading operation had not had the supervision required to safely carry it out. Burke specifically cited the lack of a marine chemist on the scene, as required by the Fire Department, and an expert in inerting procedures, as recommended by the National Fire Protection Association. Scuttling After some delay, owing to the requirement that the Coast Guard obtain written permission from the owners and insurers of Alva Cape before sinking her, the process of towing her out of the harbor began at dawn on July 2, when lines were attached fore and aft to tugboats Kerry Moran and Nancy Moran. At about 09:00, Alva Cape, the two tugs, and escorting Coast Guard cutters USCGC Spencer and USCGC Yeaton got underway to a point about southeast of New York. She was towed backwards, due to the weakness of her bow, at a speed of about . The ships arrived at the site on the morning of July 3 after a 24-hour voyage, whereupon the tugs released their lines and Spencer opened fire on Alva Cape with antiaircraft shells at 09:36. Spencer fired her full complement of 57 shells, 37 of which hit the tanker, and ceased fire at 11:59. Alva Cape, with more than of naphtha still aboard, burned for about an hour more until her hull split and she sank at 13:06.

Jhargram has one of the lowest population density among the districts of West Bengal,the rural population being higher than the urban. It is a popular tourist destination known for its sal forests, elephants,ancient temples and royal palaces. The district was formed on 4 April 2017, after bifurcation from the Paschim Medinipur district as the 22nd district of West Bengal. The district has its headquarters at Jhargram town. Demographics Jhargram district had a population of 1,136,548 in the 2011 census. 96.52% of the total population was rural and only 3.48% was urban population. 20.11% of the total population belonged to Scheduled Castes and 29.37% belonged to Scheduled Tribes. Geography Jhargram district covers an area of 3037.64 Sq. km. Out of which 268249 hectare is agricultural land and 59497 hectare is under forest coverage.The district is a part of Chota Nagpur Plateau which gradually slopes down towards east,hilly terrain occurs in the north-western part of the district. Kakrajhore area is having the highest altitude of about 300 mts. This area is covered with unfertile hard laterite soil/rocks. The altitude of southern areas of the district belonging to Nayagram, Gopiballavpur-I & II blocks are having the altitude of about 65 mts,the soil is comparatively alluvial in these areas. The altitude of Jhargram town is around 80 mts. =Rainfall= The average annual rainfall of Jhargram (Jhargram Forest Division) is about 1400 mm. The rainy season spreads over June to September due to southwest monsoon and the highest rainfall occurs in July and August. The rainfall starts decreasing from October and dry winter sets in. The dry season lasts until May. However, during this time this division gets some sporadic showers. Administration Jhargram district has 10 police stations, 8 community development blocks, 8 panchayat samitis, 79 gram panchayats, lodhasuli gram panchayat on of them, 2,996 mouzas, 2513 inhabited villages, 1 municipality and 1 census town. The single municipality is at Jhargram. The census town is Silda: The only subdivision, Jhargram subdivision, has its headquarters at Jhargram. The state Cabinet has given its nod to form 2 more sub-divisions. The three sub-divisions are supposed to be headquartered at Belpahari, Gopiballavpur and Jhargram. Forests For scientific management of forests vested in Government under Estate Acquisition Act, 1953, Jhargram Forest under the administrative setup as Jhargram Division erstwhile parent division styled as Midnapur Division was bifurcated into two divisions viz. West Midnapur Division (renamed as Jhargram Division ) with headquarters at Jhargram and East Midnapur Division with headquarters at Midnapur. The West Midnapore Division came into existence on 29.01.1954. =Location= Presently the forests of Jhargram Division are situated in the Civil Sub-division of Jhargram of Jhargram District and cover the Civil Blocks viz. Binpur-I (the portion on the West of the Kangsabati river), Binpur-II, Jhargram, Jamboni, Gopiballavpur-I & Gopiballavpur-II and police stations of Belpahari, Binpur, Jamboni, Jhargram, Gopiballavpurand Beliyabera. The Jhargram Forest Division lies between 21¬∞-52' and 22¬∞-48' North latitudes and 86¬∞-34' and 87¬∞-20' East longitude approximately. On the North, it is bordered by the civil districts of Purulia and Bankura and on the East, it is bordered by the river Kangsabati (from the western border of Midnapore Division) and partly by the river Subarnarekha from the western border of Kharagpur Division. Jharkhand shares a border with the State of Orissa in the South and in the West with the Jharkhand State. The headquarters of this Division is Jhargram which is around 15 km away from the AH46 (previously known as National Highway-6) and is situated on the Kolkata-Bombay main line of the South-Eastern Railway. The city is also the headquarters of Jhargram District. The distance of Jhargram from Kolkata is approximately 170 km. =History= In southwest Bengal (including the forests of erstwhile West Midnapore Division), history of forest and its management can be traced to the 16th century when forests were free for use by local villagers for household purposes and cleaning for cultivation. During the Mughal period under land revenue system introduced by Todar Mal, local zamindars had to pay \\"Ruba\\" or ¬º th share of revenue to Mughal Emperors for the protection being given by them. In 1773 East India Company went for the permanent settlement of forests (and the landed properties) with zamindars as proprietor. During 1890-1905 Bengal-Nagpur Railways opened railway lines (which helped the transport of forest produces to far off places with ease and less cost) and this followed by two world wars took a heavy toll of forest resources. The forests of this division were included in Jungle Mahal which was held by zamindars (local chiefs) who maintained their respective forests in a feudal tenure system. With the coming up of Bengal-Nagpur Railway lines from Kharagpur to Jamshedpur Via Jhargram, the forests of this area became accessible. The value of forest produces suddenly increased as they could be transported to far off places by rail with less cost and in quick time. The forests came to be recognized as a source of earning a higher return to the zamindars. The forests of this division were mostly owned by the Nawab of Murshidabad, the Raja of Mayurbhanj, the Raja of Jhargram, the Raja of Chilkigarh and the Mindapore Zamindar company etc. The forests were in advanced stage of degradation brought about by ruthless exploitation by the Zamindars on a rotation of 4‚Äì5 years. This system of management (mismanagement) of forests continued till 1948 when the Government of West Bengal started exercising control over the management of forests under the West Bengal Private Forests Act, 1948. But the situation did not improve much. In 1953 Estates Acquisition Act came into force and the forests so long owned by private owners (big Zamindars) were vested to the government since 1954-55 and afterward were free from all encumbrances for scientific management and control. Subsequently, possession of the forests was being taken by the Forest Department gradually depending upon the availability of records, evidence, and Court's Orders. After the State (Govt.) took over, the forests were brought under scientific management. However, by this time, the productivity of the forests had gone down to such a level that they could not meet the growing demands of forest produces from ever-increasing population of fringe areas and the county as a whole. The problem was further multiplied due to growing unemployment in the forest fringe villagers and lack of enough resources in the rural areas to tide over the situation. Administrative measures and policing efforts to thwart the biotic pressures on the forests only resulted in increased people-forester conflict and led to complete alienation of the fringe population from the administration. The job of protection of forests became hazardous. The administration had almost failed to tackle the situation and had been looking for some solution. A pilot project was launched in 1971-72 by the then Divisional Forest Officer, Silviculture(South) Division at Arabari of East Midnapore Division. The objective was to involve the people living on the fringes of forests, in protecting forest resources through improvement of their socio-economic condition. During 1985-86 the pilot project was reviewed, evaluated and analyzed. It appeared that the entire project area had become restocked with nearly 700 ha of sal coppice forests and 300 ha of plantation crop. In fact, this pilot project proved to be a success. This formula of involvement of indigenous people in forest protection and management was translated in other areas including West Midnapore Division since mid-eighties very successfully. Govt. gave recognition to this system of management of forests (popularly termed as Joint Forest Management) by issuing a Govt. Order during 1989 and amendments during 1990 and 1991. Presently this division is having nearly 480 Forest Protection Committees. On and from 1 April 2006 the West Midnapore Division has been reorganized and renamed as Jhargram Forest Division. 3 (three) Ranges namely Chandabila, Nayagram, and Kesorekha Ranges have been transferred to Kharagpur Division with all establishments. Therefore, the area of Jhargram Division becomes 620 km2 approximately. Rivers The important rivers of this division are the Kangsabati (popularly known as Kasai), the Tarafeni, the Subarnarekha, and the Dulong. Apart from the above rivers, there are several rivulets viz. 'Deb', 'Palpala', Rangium', 'Kupon' etc. Most of the above rivers flow from west to east as the Western side of the division is having higher altitude. = The Kangsabati river= This river enters the division on the north from Bankura district and flows along a tortuous course running to the south and southwest direction and then flows towards east keeping the Midnapore town on the left(north). The river has contracted rapidly below Midnapore and at Kapastikri (about 20 km down below from Midnapore) the river has bifurcated. One course has gone towards the north and finally has drained into the Rupnarayan river while the other course has run towards the south-east and finally has fallen into the Haldi river. =The Tarafeni river= This river originates in the northwest portion of this division near Patagarh in Banspahari Range. It runs towards east within the jurisdiction of Belpahari and Binpur police Stations and finally has fallen into the Kangsabati river. = The Subarnarekha river= This river enters the division on the west from Dhalbhum (Jharkhand State) and passes through the south of the division intersecting the Gopiballavpur Police Station and forming the northern boundary of Nayagram Police Station (Kharagpur Division). On the south of Dantan, it enters the Balasore district of Odisha and finally falls into the Bay of Bengal. The Subarnarekha has a rapid stream with a sandy bed, and its banks are generally high and well defined. In the season of high flood, the river overflows its left bank about 6 km above the point where it leaves Paschim Midnapore district to enter the Balasore district. =The Dulung river= It is the main tributary of the Subarnarekha. It originates in the northwest portion of the division near Dulungdiha (J.L.No. 100, P.S.: Binpur) and runs generally in a southern direction near the western boundary of the division till it enters Jamboni Police Station. While passing through this police station from north to south it is joined by the Kupon river, Banshir Khal, Polpala Khal, Deb river and Putrangi Khal. Thereafter, it enters Gopiballavpur Police Station where its general direction is from west to east and then Sankrail police station where it again runs in a southerly direction and joins the Subarnarekha.

He is notable as the executive who backed Jerry Seinfeld's series Seinfeld, which went on to become one of the most popular and successful television sitcoms of all time. During his 31 years at NBC, Ludwin worked with every The Tonight Show host‚ÄîSteve Allen and Jack Paar, albeit after their time on Tonight, as well as Johnny Carson, Jay Leno, Conan O'Brien, and Jimmy Fallon. He also helped guide the network through the Conan O'Brien and Jay Leno conflict in 2010. Early life and education Ludwin was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on May 27, 1948, and grew up in the suburb of Rocky River. He graduated from Rocky River High School in 1966 and attended Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, graduating with a degree in mass communications in 1970. Ludwin started his television career in 1968 hosting the talk show Studio 14 on Miami University's WPDT Channel 14. For years, Ludwin returned to his alma mater to talk to students. In March 2019, the Williams Hall studio where he began his television career was named the Richard A. Ludwin Television Production Facility. He also donated items and memorabilia‚Äîincluding 15 original Seinfeld scripts‚Äîto the university, where it is now housed as the Rick Ludwin Collection. Career In the 1970s, Ludwin wrote jokes for Bob Hope and produced a variety show that aired in Ohio. After graduating from college, Ludwin joined NBC in 1980 and worked at the network for 32 years, during which time he was executive vice president of late night and special programming. As vice president, he oversaw The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Late Night with Conan O'Brien, and Saturday Night Live. He was a staunch supporter of Late Night with Conan O'Brien during its fledgling early years, when other executives wanted the show cancelled, and championed several other notable series, including Seinfeld and The Office. Even though Ludwin had never worked on a sitcom before, he commissioned the Seinfeld pilot \\"The Seinfeld Chronicles\\", which aired in 1989. Other NBC executives wanted to pass on the series, but Ludwin lobbied on behalf of the show and used money from his specials budget to order four more episodes. Though market testing was mostly negative in response to \\"The Seinfeld Chronicles\\", Ludwin believed in the show so much he canceled a planned Bob Hope special in order to finance Seinfelds first full season. When then-NBC President Brandon Tartikoff worried it was \\"too New York\\" and \\"too Jewish\\" and thus would not be popular with mainstream American audiences, Ludwin, who was not Jewish, defended the show and its content. The series was immensely popular, earning NBC more than $2 billion during its nine seasons, with an additional $3 billion in syndication deals. Ludwin was promoted from executive vice president to senior vice president in 2005. Following the 2010 Tonight Show conflict, Ludwin fell out of favor with Jay Leno, who was unhappy the executive had backed Conan O'Brien over him. Leno reportedly stopped communicating with Ludwin. In September 2011, NBC announced that Ludwin would make a transition into acting as a consultant for the network. He left NBC in 2012. Death Ludwin died from organ failure in Los Angeles on November 10, 2019, at age 71. Late night television hosts Conan O'Brien, Seth Meyers, and Jimmy Fallon also paid tribute to him on their respective shows, as well as a tribute on a Saturday Night Live episode on November 16, 2019.

Starring Nicolas Cage and Selma Blair, the film premiered in the Midnight Madness section at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival, and was theatrically released on January 19, 2018 by Momentum Pictures. A joint British and American production, the film received generally positive reviews from critics. Plot The film begins with a mother putting on music for her child as she sets her car on railroad tracks and leaves the child in the car to die. The Ryans are a family of four with a strained relationship. Brent, the father, does not approve of his daughter Carly's new boyfriend Damon; Carly considers her mother Kendall out of touch, fights with her younger brother Josh, and is currently upset about canceling plans with her boyfriend because her grandparents are visiting. While Carly is at school, radios and TV screens suddenly start transmitting unexplained static. The effect is seen as the Ryans' housekeeper murders her own daughter in front of a terrified Josh and a mob of parents rushes to Carly's school to kill their children however they can; Carly sees one classmate being stabbed by his mother after he scales a fence to reach her. Carly escapes with her friend Riley, whose mother strangles her when the two girls reach Riley's house. Carly runs home in terror and finds Damon, who has killed his father in self-defense. Telling Carly that the parents only want to kill their own kids, he accompanies her home to get Josh somewhere safe. Kendall goes to the hospital where her sister Jeannie is giving birth, but the static transmits just afterward, causing her to attempt to kill her newborn daughter as Kendall tries to save her. Kendall escapes the hospital after seeing television reports of the mass hysteria: the static compels parents to slaughter their children. Kendall heads home to protect her own children. Seeing Carly at home with Damon, the hysteria overtakes Brent and he knocks Damon out and attacks Carly. Kendall, having been exposed to the static, joins him when she gets home. Carly and Josh lock themselves in the basement and Brent and Kendall use a power saw to get through the door. Josh pulls out Brent's gun and fires through the door, wounding his mother. Kendall and Brent, bonding over their shared filicidal desire, run a hose from their oven's gas pump to the basement to poison the kids. When Carly sees the gas, she rigs up a trap with matches at the door and hides with Josh in the ventilation system. Brent cuts the lock off and opens the door, igniting the gas and triggering an explosion that knocks both parents out and awakens Damon. Damon helps Carly and Josh evade their parents, but Kendall awakens, stabs him in the cheek, and knocks him out again. As the parents close in on their kids, the doorbell rings. When Brent opens the door, his mother pepper-sprays him and his father stabs him; the hysteria affects them as well. Everyone chases one another through the house: Josh evades Brent, who attempts to hide from his father in the garage; Kendall chases Carly and hits her on the head before her mother-in-law knocks her out. Brent starts the car and crashes it, killing both his parents and knocking himself out. Kendall prepares to finish Carly off, but Damon knocks her out with a shovel. Kendall and Brent wake up to find themselves restrained in the basement with Carly, Josh, and Damon watching them. They continue to exhibit symptoms of the hysteria, and the kids refuse to let them go. Kendall tearfully tells the children she loves them, and Brent continues: \\"But sometimes we just want to‚Äî-\\" The film ends before he can finish his sentence.

Set on more than of downtown Harrisburg, it includes the Pennsylvania State Capitol and a landscaped park environment with monuments, memorials, and other government buildings. It is bounded on the north by Forster Street, the east by North 7th Street, the south by Walnut Street, and the west by North 3rd Street. Most of this area (bounded on the north by North Street) is a National Historic Landmark District, recognized in 2013 as a fully realized example of the City Beautiful movement landscape and planning design of Arnold Brunner. Description The Pennsylvania State Capitol Complex is located in central downtown Harrisburg, four blocks east of the Susquehanna River. Its centerpiece is the Pennsylvania State Capitol, constructed in 1902 - 1906 to a design by Joseph Miller Huston. The capitol is a nationally recognized example of Beaux Arts architecture, and is known for its interior opulence and artwork. On the east side of the capitol is the East Wing, a 1987 extension that greatly expands the building's capacity without detracting from the surrounding landscape. Flanking the East Wing to the north and south are the North and South Office Buildings, begun in 1927 and 1919 respectively; they are similarly scaled and both built of Indiana limestone in the Classical Revival style, but have slightly different styling. South of the Capitol is the Ryan Office Building, the oldest building (completed 1894) of the complex. Between the two buildings a semicircular walkway provides access to them as well as the East Wing entrance to the Capitol, with a fountain in the center. Across Commonwealth Avenue east of the North and South Office Buildings, a pair of buildings extend the line of the North and South Buildings, with the Soldiers' and Sailors' Memorial Grove, a park setting with many memorials and monuments in between. On the south side of the grove is the Forum, and the Finance Building is to the north. Both continue the use of Indiana limestone and Classical Revival styling. The easternmost portion of the complex is the Soldiers' and Sailor's Bridge, which connects the complex to neighborhoods across the railroad tracks that run east of North 7th Street. The complex has been extended across North Street to include the Modernist State Museum of Pennsylvania building and the adjacent Department of Transportation building. The complex and greater area is protected full-time by the Pennsylvania Capitol Police‚Äîits dedicated law enforcement agency‚Äîas well as the Harrisburg Bureau of Police, which patrols the entire city. Development history Harrisburg's Capitol Hill has been the seat of Pennsylvania state government since 1822, when its first capitol building was dedicated. That structure, much altered over the 19th century. In 1893 work began on what is now the Ryan Office Building. The first capitol burned down in 1897, and its replacement was abandoned in an unfinished state in 1899 after negative public and legislative response to its exterior. The present capitol was begun in 1902 and completed in 1906. In the 1910s the state recognized the need for additional space, and acquired the area then known as the Eighth Ward, between Commonwealth Avenue and North 7th Street. Arnold Brunner was selected to develop a master landscaping and design plan for this space, which he did using then-fashionable City Beautiful principles. Although only small portions of his vision were realized in his lifetime (he died in 1925), the resulting landscape is very much in keeping with his original plans. The principal deviation is the area now occupied by the East Wing. Brunner had planned this as a \\"People's Forecourt\\", an open space whose landscaping would tie the Capitol and the North and South Buildings together visually. In execution, the area became a parking lot serving the capitol until the East Wing was built, providing a different and more modern type of visual unity. The Capitol building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2006. The latter designation was expanded to include the entire area of the complex south of North Street in 2013.

The business and financial press describe it as a service that \\"makes the real estate market more like the stock market\\" by allowing investors to select the individual transactions in which they participate, while investing a smaller amount than would be required to fully fund a transaction. For example, 12 institutional investors (such as family offices and endowments) participated in a $60 million office building purchase. The firm has more than $1 billion under management, and was named to Forbes' \\"FinTech50\\" for 4 years in a row starting in 2016. In 2019, Cadre was the cover story of the Forbes \\"FinTech 50\\" issue. In 2018, a partnership with Goldman Sachs was announced through which Goldman Sachs' private wealth clients committed at least $250 million (USD) real estate investments through Cadre. The company also offers a managed portfolio service and a real estate secondary market, as well as a cash holdings account called \\"Cadre Cash\\". History CEO Ryan Williams started the company with Thrive Capital founder Josh Kushner, and General Catalyst, which together invested $18 million in a 2015 fundraising round. Startup capital included a $250 million line of credit from the family of George Soros.https://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump- adviser-kushners-undisclosed-partners-include-goldman-and-soros-2017-05-03 Kushner has since divested. That round also included a $250 million backstop liquidity commitment from an unnamed family office. Vornado CEO Michael Fascitelli also invested in this round and joined the board. Jared Kushner helped launch the business with Williams, and advised the firm for approximately 18 months. Williams was named one of Forbes' \\"30 Under 30\\" for 2018. Former Vornado Realty Trust CEO Michael D. Fascitelli leads the investment committee. Other team members were hired from Silicon Valley firms, such as head of product Andrew Borovsky from Square, Inc., and the former head of engineering from Mint.com. In 2019, the company announced the hire of former LendingTree executive Sam Mischner to serve as Chief Commercial Officer. In 2016, the firm raised another $50 million, which included Michael Fascitelli joining Cadre's investment committee. In 2017, it was named an \\"Inc. New York start-up to watch\\", to Equities.com's Pioneer 250, and to Fast Company's \\"5 FinTech startups to watch\\". The firm raised an additional $65 million in 2017 in a round led by Andreessen Horowitz. A 2018 deal permits private wealth clients of Goldman Sachs to invest through the Cadre platform. In early 2018, it was reported that leaders of the company planned to expand their service offering to include residential real estate loans. The article was later updated to clarify that the new business will involve investing in loans issued by others. In 2018 the company announced the \\"Cadre Secondary Market,\\" which permits users to sell positions after a one-year holding period. It also announced the \\"Cadre Managed Portfolio\\" service, which allows users to create a diversified account with a $250,000 minimum. In late 2018, the company launched an opportunity zone fund based on tax changes established in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which were designed to encourage investment in low-income areas. Investors who invest in qualified projects and meet holding-period requirements face reduced capital gains taxes and may defer other capital gains taxes. In a 2019 CNN interview, CEO Ryan Williams said that Cadre's ability to disrupt the industry was because \\"real estate is a Jurassic industry. It's antiquated.\\". In late 2019 it was reported the Cadre had returned more than $100 million to investors. In 2020, Cadre announced that it hired Allen Smith, former CEO of Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, as president. Smith previously worked as the CEO of Prudential Real Estate Investors. Jared Kushner divested his stake in February 2019. Also in 2020, CEO Ryan Williams announced plans for Cadre to support increased equality. The company made Juneteenth a company holiday and Williams, who shared his personal ancestry story including former slaves, also published a plan to help increase economic opportunity for diverse communities through \\"formal mentorship programs to provide hands-on guidance, and ... comprehensive skills-training programs that help people of all ages get a start in careers that will allow them to succeed in a fast-changing economy.\\" In October 2020, Cadre added the \\"Cadre Cash\\" platform, allowing investors to earn up to a 3% reward on qualifying cash balances held in the platform. Platform  Traditional real estate investment funds vest all decision-making with a paid manager; individual participants have no ability to select transactions in which to participate. By contrast, Cadre permits investors to choose what investments to make on a building or project level. Cadre curates investment opportunities, and uses an electronic platform to make these qualified opportunities available to investors. Individual investors can then buy a stake in any project. The company performs diligence using its data analysis software and data analysis team. For sellers, the company claims higher speed and lower fees as advantages. CEO Williams claims that real estate \\"builds multi-generational wealth\\", and, \\"Cadre provides access to more members of the global economy with the opportunity to build wealth\\". Secondary sales and managed portfolios are also supported. In the future, the firm intends to use its data analytics platform to allow investment in opaque, illiquid asset classes beyond real estate (such as \\"energy, natural resources, oil, infrastructure, or anything that's historically been privately held or inaccessible\\"). The platform also offers a annual reward of up to 3% (as of 2020) on qualifying cash balances in the \\"Cadre Cash\\" program.

The second accident caused injuries, high material damages and a major train service disruption. The third accident happened when an empty train was used for tests during the investigation. Preconditions Stuttgart Hbf is a terminus railway station, except for S-Bahn (commuter rail) trains and underground trams. It is to be replaced by an underground through station, called Stuttgart 21, a much-debated project that is already under construction. To make room for the construction site, the platforms had to be moved away from the current station building. This required the points area to be moved to confined space, too. Construction activity and infrastructure changes are still happening. All the trains mentioned here were push‚Äìpull trains and consisted of eleven passenger cars (including one control car) and a trailing, pushing electric locomotive. All vehicles with German traditional coupling must pass force (here: tractive effort) either by the coupling (pulling force) or the buffers (pushing force). A pushing engine must not exceed certain force levels (that depend on points, curves, train length, mass and vehicle types), or the train may be distorted, e.g. pushed outwards in a curve. In extreme cases as these, derailment may happen. First Derailment On July 24, 2012, IC 2312 departed from track 10. It consisted of one leading Steuerwagen (Control car), nine more passenger cars, a dining car (last car) and a trailing DB Class 101 electric locomotive to push the train. The engine and the two cars next to it derailed. Construction work to rectify distortions on the tracks was about to begin after the train's departure. The 40 km/h speed restriction, as commanded by signal aspect Hp 2, was respected, 29 km/h were reached. In addition to findings that affected all trains (see below), the driver has been blamed for accelerating the train too fast, so the force applied throughout the sequence of buffers was too large (191 kN instead of the 150 kN limit). Nobody was injured. The damage was determined as ‚Ç¨370,000. Three tracks of the station had to be closed. Second Derailment On September 29, 2012 (Saturday), IC 2312 departed from track 10 (same as above). It consisted of one leading control car, seven more passenger cars, one dining car, two other passenger cars and a trailing DB Class 101 engine. The speed limit of 40 km/h (on signal Hp 2) was fully utilized. The engine and the three adjacent cars derailed. The train took down two catenary support masts, thus tearing down part of the catenary, which had then to be switched off. The tracks also had to be closed for the rescue to begin, and both actions separated the entire station from the network for hours. Several tracks were reopened on the same day, allowing to return to service, but many long distance trains had to bypass the station on this day. Eight persons received minor injuries. The damage was determined as ‚Ç¨6,482,000. Third Derailment On October 09, 2012, three test runs were initiated in addition to software- based simulations to support the investigation, and indeed, the last try reproduced the derailments. The train resembled the one of the second accident in type and sequence. The last three cars (those in front of the engine) derailed. The tests were meant to prove that track 10 and the following points were safe to be used, but the opposite happened. Again, long distance trains had to be rerouted. Investigation Results The accidents' immediate cause was determined: The exceptional length of the type of dining car used and the position of its bogies resulted in a greater horizontal buffer misalignment than the other car types. It lacked buffers that were broad enough to handle this offset, so buffers slipped past each other and jammed, preventing the required lateral movement. The report recommended reviewing the buffers used and replacing them if necessary. The track layout was shown to have some deficiencies regarding the sequence of curves, specifically straight elements inside S-curves. The combination of track elements within a small area had taken them to the allowable limits, increasing wear and reducing stability. The report discussed different layouts. Also, track distortions and wear had been found before the first accident, but had not been rectified, or had not been recognized due to errors.

Prithivirajan falls in love with Samyuktha the princess and daughter of the King of Delhi, Jayachandran. Though Prithivirajan and Jayachandran joined hands and defeated Mohammed Ghori, something happened and they became enemies.

The film was mostly funded by a Kickstarter campaign.  Synopsis  As Jen Senko tries to understand the transformation of her father from a nonpolitical Democrat to an angry Republican fanatic, she uncovers the forces behind the media that changed him completely: a plan by Roger Ailes under President Richard Nixon for a media takeover by the Republicans, the 1971 Powell Memo urging business leaders to influence institutions of public opinion (especially the media, universities, and courts), the 1987 dismantling of the Fairness Doctrine under President Ronald Reagan, and the signing of the 1996 Telecommunications Act under President Bill Clinton. The documentary aims to show how the media and the nation changed, which leads to questions about who owns the airwaves, what rights listeners and watchers have, and what responsibility the government has to keep the airwaves fair, accurate, and accountable. Content Senko's father, Frank, was stated by her as originally being a \\"nonpolitical Kennedy Democrat\\" who began changing into a far-right Republican in the 1980s. On her father's lengthy commute to his place of employment, he listened to conservative talk radio, which Senko believes started the change in her father's personality. In particular, he listened to Rush Limbaugh and watched Fox News. Towards the end of his life, Frank's views mostly changed back to being somewhere in the middle due to his wife exposing him to liberal media. He died in January 2016 at the age of 93. Production The film raised 947 backers from Kickstarter; people who noticed the campaign wrote to Senko and she followed up by Skype to receive their stories, which were later put into the film. One Kickstarter backer, Ryan Smith, became an executive producer and provided the remaining funding needed. Archivist Richard Kroll was hired to search for photographs and video material. Reception Marsha Lederman of The Globe and Mail wrote a mixed review of the film, saying that the film's topics are \\"fascinating\\" but that its examination feels \\"shallow\\". Carole Di Tosti of Blogcritics wrote, \\"The documentary is well edited and tells a fascinating story of propagandists, stealth and wealth.

It has a single leaf and up to three bright pink flowers. The type specimen was collected at Yandina in southern Queensland but there are also records from southern New South Wales. Description Caladenia gracillima is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single leaf, 90‚Äì150 mm long and 2‚Äì3 mm wide. Up to three bright pink flowers with dusky pink backs and 25‚Äì40 mm long, 20‚Äì40 mm wide are borne on a stalk 100‚Äì200 mm tall. The dorsal sepal is erect, 10‚Äì18 mm long and 2‚Äì4 mm wide. The lateral sepals are 13‚Äì25 mm long, 4‚Äì6 mm wide and the petals are 12‚Äì22 mm long, 2‚Äì5 mm wide and spread fan-like with the lateral sepals in front of the flower. The labellum is 6‚Äì8 mm long, 5‚Äì7 mm wide and white with pink to mauve edges. The sides of the labellum turn upwards and the tip has 8 to 14 yellow to orange teeth on each side and curls downward. There are two rows of red to orange calli along the centre of the labellum. Flowering occurs from August to September. Taxonomy and naming This orchid was first formally described in 1939 by Herman Rupp who gave it the name Caladenia carnea var. gracillima and published the description in The Queensland Naturalist from a specimen collected at Yandina. In 2000, David Jones raised the variety to species status. The specific epithet (gracillima) is the superlative form of the Latin word gracilis meaning \\"slender\\" or \\"thin\\", hence \\"most slender\\". Referring to C. carnea var. gracillima, Rupp noted \\"the segments are narrow and acuminate\\" and \\"the labellum is ...narrower than in other forms\\". Distribution and habitat Pretty fingers grows in forest between Dayboro and Cooroy in south-east Queensland but there are also records from the southern tablelands of New South Wales.

Originally built by Clyde Engineering between 1965 and 1966 as Queensland Rail's 1460 class locomotives.

Introduction and service  Following the rebuilding of the DQ and QR class locomotives at Tranz Rails Hutt Workshops, Tranz Rail sold three QRs accompanied the second batch of DQ class locomotives due to a locomotive shortage due to the planned replacement of Tasrails English Electric locomotive fleet.

Three of its residential bishops are recorded (although author Morcelli assigns them to Tiddi): * Donatus I suffered gravely, according to Saint Optatus (bishop of Milevis), under the heresy Donatism and was deprived of his see in 362 by their bishop Felix of Idicra * The Council of Carthage (484), called by Huneric of the Vandal Kingdom, was attended for Tisedi by both a Catholic bishop Lampadius, who was banished afterwards, and his Donatist counterpart, Donatus.

Since leaving the AWM in 1996, Edwards has worked as a senior academic, scholar and historical consultant. In 2006 his book Arthur Tange: Last of the Mandarins won the Queensland Premier's History Book Award and the Western Australian Premier's Book Award for Non-Fiction. Early life and education Edwards was born on 29 August 1945 in Watford, England, to Geoffrey and Joan Edwards. The family moved to Australia in 1950, where Peter was educated at Christ Church Grammar School, Perth. He graduated from the University of Western Australia with a Bachelor of Arts with Honours, and in 1967 received a Rhodes Scholarship to undertake doctoral studies at Wadham College, Oxford. Career On graduating from Oxford, Edwards was employed as a Historical Research Officer within the Department of Foreign Affairs from 1971. Here, he worked as an editor on the first three volumes of Documents on Australian Foreign Policy, 1937‚Äì49. The volumes, published between 1975 and 1979, dealt with the build-up towards and initial period of the Second World War. Edwards was awarded a Harkness Fellowship to Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, in 1975, and moved over to the Australian National University (ANU) as a Research Fellow in History later that year. In 1978 he was appointed to the University of Adelaide as Master of St. Mark's College. Work on his first authored history, Prime Ministers and Diplomats, was completed during this time. The book was published in 1983 by Oxford University Press. =Official Historian= In 1982 Edwards, by now an established scholar of diplomatic history, was appointed Official Historian and general editor of The Official History of Australia's Involvement in Southeast Asian Conflicts 1948‚Äì1975. Based out of the Australian War Memorial (AWM) in Canberra, the multi-volume history was commissioned to cover Australia's involvement in the Malayan Emergency, Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia confrontation and Vietnam War. Edwards continued the tradition established by Charles Bean, Gavin Long and Robert O'Neill in Australia's earlier official war histories by adopting a holistic approach that sought to analyse the operational, strategic, political, social and medical aspects of the Australian experience. In dealing with twenty-seven years of history, the series spanned the longest period of an Australian official history commissioned to that time. The result was a nine-volume series, published between 1992 and 2012, with contributions from nine historians. Edwards authored two of the volumes. Crises & Commitments (1992), written with Gregory Pemberton, analysed the political and diplomatic history of Australia's involvement in the three conflicts up to 1965, while A Nation at War (1997) covered the political, diplomatic and social history of Australia's Vietnam War from 1965 to 1975. Crises & Commitments received a somewhat contentious reception. John Murphy criticised the volume for what he saw as an overemphasis on the diplomatic and for skirting the social controversies of the Vietnam era; he also questioned the need for an official history. Pemberton, a senior researcher on the history who drafted several of the earlier chapters before leaving the project acrimoniously in 1990, took issue with the book as well, arguing that his input \\"had been censored and sanitised in the final product\\". Edwards acknowledged substantial rewrites to Pemberton's drafts in the foreword to Crises & Commitments, but the extent of and reasoning for the changes were not made clear. A Nation at War experienced a warmer reception, winning the Foundation of Australian Literary Studies Award and H. T. Priestley Medal. In spite of Murphy's doubts, the official history series was also \\"praised [for] its detached and scholarly analysis of complex events\\", according to the Oxford Companion to Australian Military History. However, the project was not without its trials. Edwards' initial plan to employ a team of writers was thwarted by a lack of resources and funds. He instead had to enlist for some of the volumes historians based outside of the AWM, who agreed to work on the history without financial compensation. The series also experienced problems with staff turnover. Aside from Pemberton, the unexpected death in 1998 of Ian McNeill, author of the volumes on the Australian Army, caused extensive delays to the series' completion. The first seven volumes (including McNeill's To Long Tan [1993], dealing with army operations up to 1966), were delivered in a timely fashion and published successively from 1992 to 1998. However, McNeill's next volume was only partway written when he died. His research assistant, Ashley Ekins, was eventually appointed to complete the series. On the Offensive was published in 2003, while the final volume, Fighting to the Finish, appeared in 2012two decades after the first volume, and sixteen years after Edwards' position at the AWM had ended. Again following the path of Bean and Long, Edwards was then commissioned by the AWM to write a single-volume summary of the series. Australia and the Vietnam War was published by NewSouth in 2014. =Senior scholar= On leaving the AWM in 1996, Edwards was appointed executive director of the Australian Centre for American Studies (1996‚Äì1998). He was a senior tutor at St Paul's College, University of Sydney in 1998, and from that year until 2005 was a senior consulting historian at the AWM. In 2001 Edwards was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia for his \\"service to the recording of Australia's military history\\" as Official Historian. Later that year he was a Visiting Scholar at the John Curtin Prime Ministerial Library, Curtin University, and made a Visiting Professor at the Australian Defence Force Academy, a position he held until 2008. Edwards' biography of public servant and diplomat Sir Arthur Tange was published in 2006. The book, Arthur Tange: Last of the Mandarins, had been supported by a 1999 Harold White Fellowship at the National Library of Australia, and went on to win the Queensland Premier's History Book Award and the Western Australian Premier's Book Award for Non-Fiction. He later edited Tange's memoirs for publication: Defence Policy-Making: A Close-Up View, 1950‚Äì1980 was released in 2008, seven years after Tange's death. Edwards was made a Fellow of the Australian Institute of International Affairs in 2009. The following year he co-authored with Wendy Hillman A School with a View, a centenary history of his former high school, Christ Church Grammar. He has been an Honorary Professor at Deakin University since 2012 (a position he previously held from 1999 to 2005) and at the ANU since 2014. He is a previous contributing editor of the Australian Journal of International Affairs (2002‚Äì2008), and was a trustee of the Shrine of Remembrance from 2002 to 2009. Personal Edwards has been married to Jacky Abbott since 20 September 1997, and has two daughters from a previous relationship. He describes his key interests as \\"reading\\", and lives in the Melbourne suburb of North Fitzroy.

He played a key role in setting up the Department of Physics and Astrophysics at the University of Delhi - which he headed for around nine years - and also served as pro-vice-chancellor of the university. He was elected Fellow of the Indian National Science Academy and was General Secretary of the National Academy of Sciences, India.  Early life  Ramesh Chandra Majumdar was born on 1 March 1904 in Patgram, a village in Dhaka district of Bengal in British India, now in Bangladesh. His father, Mahesh Chandra Majumdar worked in a tea estate in Jalpaiguri district of West Bengal. Ramesh Chandra had his schooling in Jalpaiguri. After completing his undergraduate studies at Rajshahi College, Majumdar went to Calcutta to study for his Master's degree in physics. Majumdar started his studies in physics at Calcutta University, in the laboratory of B. B. Ray, where he carried out an experiment that demonstrated the Raman effect in X-rays; this was subsequently published in Nature in 1931. After completing his Master's in 1927, he moved to Allahabad University, where he wrote a research paper with Meghnad Saha. For the rest of his career, he would concentrate on theoretical physics. With Saha's encouragement, he went abroad for his doctoral studies, and obtained his Ph.D. degree from the University of Jena. During this period, he was a frequent visitor to Cambridge University, where his friend and collaborator Daulat Singh Kothari was working for his Ph.D. According to one source, Majumdar went to Cambridge, \\"arriving‚Äîit is said‚Äîon the doorstep of Lord Rutherford's home on a Sunday afternoon.\\"  Career  After his return to India, Majumdar taught for a short period at Panjab University, Lahore. He then worked at the Bose Institute in Calcutta , before joining the Physics Department (later renamed Department of Physics and Astrophysics) of the University of Delhi in 1944. Along with Daulat Singh Kothari, who was then head of the Department, he played an important role in building up the department by hiring key people to start new research groups. He headed the department from 1948 to 1951. In 1961, when Kothari was appointed chairman of the University Grants Commission (UGC), Majumdar again took over as head of the department, and held the position until his appointment as pro-vice- chancellor in 1967. During his tenure as head, the department was recognised as a Centre of Advanced Studies by the UGC. Majumdar held the post of pro- vice-chancellor of the university from 1967 to 1969. Upon his retirement, he was appoied Professor Emeritus for life. Both as head and as pro-vice chancellor, Majumdar was responsible for new facilities being set up in the department. He held a visiting assignment at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in 1948. According to Piara Singh Gill, who held Majumdar in high regard as representing \\"the best traditions of scholarship\\", the Tata Institute authorities wanted Majumdar to stay on in Bombay, but he chose to return to Delhi. Majumdar was also a founding member of the Delhi University Teachers' Association.

As mentioned above, he played a major role in building up the Department of Physics and Astrophysics, both by hiring faculty to build up specific research areas and by setting up research facilities. He was also an influential teacher. Many students who attended his classes were inspired to take up research careers. Overall, Majumdar, through his life and work, reinforced the idea that it was possible to do high-quality physics research in a university, as evidenced by his turning down the TIFR offer. Majumdar also started a tradition of organising summer schools on topics of current interest. These were typically directed at Ph.D. students, and held at various hill stations in Northern India.

Josh Caras and Ian Christopher Noel star as residents of a dystopian city who attempt to find details about the death of their mutual friend, a computer hacker. It premiered at the 2015 Tribeca Film Festival.  Plot  Twenty-five years after an unspecified cataclysm known as \\"The Reset\\", tech company Vopo Technologies rebuilds society in City Six. Although Vopo has access to modern technology, which they use to maintain control, the people scavenge for 1980s-era parts. Simon, a computer technician, learns his best friend, Eric, has committed suicide. At the funeral, he observes Max. Max later sells scavenged computer parts to a shop where Simon works. Though Max brushes off Simon's attempts to make conversation, he later comes back to request aid in decoding an encrypted message Eric sent him. Max is disappointed to learn that Simon has quit his job to work for Vopo, as he believes Vopo to be untrustworthy. Simon easily accesses Eric's message. After watching cryptic video footage together, Max kicks out Simon to further research the matter alone. Simon returns the next day and insists Max allow him to help, pointing out that his Vopo contacts could prove useful. Max agrees, and they leave the city to visit the house of a woman seen in the footage, disguised as Vopo technicians. The woman knows nothing, but in her house, Max and Simon find clues that lead them to a fellow computer hacker, Steven, who was working with Eric. Overhearing from a Vopo security officer who has come to visit the house that Steven has died, they contact his girlfriend's sister, Grace, who works at a hospital. Grace explains she has been searching for her missing sister. She leads them to a safe house said to frequented by anti-Vopo hackers, though they find little information. When a curfew passes, they hide from a Vopo patrol and crash at Grace's house. There, the three get to know each other better. Simon says he drifted apart from Eric once Eric began hanging out with computer hackers who opposed Vopo, and Max reveals that he met Eric at a juvenile detention center, where Eric taught him how to hack computers. The others press Max to plays a tape, which they believe to be music; instead, it is a recording of his mother, who Max believes was killed by Vopo. Simon dances with Grace, eventually telling her that Steven has died. After they leave Grace's house, they see a man kill her. Though shaken, they continue their investigation. At work, Paul Bateson, the co-founder of Vopo, speaks to Simon. He says he knows of Simon and Max's investigation, saying Simon reminds him of himself and his idealistic partner, Tom, a talented computer hacker who, for reasons left unexplained by Bateson, is no longer with Vopo. Urged by an anonymous computer hacker, Max and Simon uncover a hidden message left by Tom in which he expresses regret with how Vopo and the city have turned out, inviting anyone who can decode his message to join him searching out other surviving cities. Later, while discussing this with Bateson, Bateson stresses the need for stability and safety over idealism. Bateson reasons that even if any other settlements existed ‚Äì which he discounts ‚Äì they would only raid City Six if they knew of its success. Simon and Max leave the city, violating a curfew by bluffing their way through a guard post via Simon's Vopo credentials and hacking Vopo's computer surveillance. Outside the city, they find a wide desert. Overjoyed by their newfound freedom, Max encourages Simon to leave City Six with him. Simon reveals that he informed on Eric to save himself when Eric was sent to juvenile detention, and Max says he already knew this. Max repeats his offer, but Simon declines, saying he has chosen to ally himself with Vopo. He urges Max to flee from Vopo's security and says he will no longer be able to help him beyond this point. As a drone approaches, Simon watches Max flee.  Cast  * Josh Caras as Simon * Ian Christopher Noel as Max * Joslyn Jensen as Grace * Reed Birney as Paul Bateson  Production  Writer-director Carleton Ranney was inspired by news stories about WikiLeaks and Aaron Swartz, a hacktivist who committed suicide. Although the film was shot in Austin, Texas, Ranney sought to keep the setting ambiguous. Ranney also kept details about the world itself ambiguous, including the nature of The Reset, as he felt it worked better as a mystery that not even the fictional world fully understood. Ranney cited David Cronenberg, Michael Mann, William Gibson, and films of the 1980s, including WarGames and the claustrophobic close-ups in Dekalog: One, as further inspirations. The film's themes address how technology can be used to both aid and hinder free access to information and make human connections. The film's outdated technology was sourced from a Goodwill computer museum.  Release  Jackrabbit premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in April 2015.  Reception  John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter called it a \\"moody and terse\\" film whose slow pacing and minimalist story will leave mainstream audiences uninterested. Maria Vultaggio of the International Business Times described it as \\"exciting in theory, but lacking in execution\\", criticizing its lack of substance.

Fidget spinners became trending toys in 2017, although similar devices had been invented as early as 1993. The toy has been promoted as helping people who have trouble focusing or those who may need to fidget to relieve nervous energy, anxiety, or psychological stress. There are claims that a fidget spinner can help calm down people who have anxiety and other neurological disorders like ADHD and autism. However, as of May 2017, there is no scientific evidence that they are effective as a treatment for ADHD. Design Spinning fidget spinner Fidget spinners are toys not unlike yo-yo or other skill toys, designed to spin with little effort. A basic fidget spinner usually consists of a two- or three- pronged design with a bearing in its center circular pad. However, the number of prongs may vary - some may have six or more. A person holds the center pad while the toy spins. They are made from various materials including brass, stainless steel, titanium, copper, aluminium, and plastic. The bearings are generally ceramic, metal (stainless steel or chrome), and some are hybridssuch as ceramic balls with stainless races and cages. Each fidget spinner also has two or more weights on the outside that make it spin faster and stay balanced. Bearings can vary to adjust for the design's spin time, vibration, and noise, causing unique sensory feedback. Being a kind of a flywheel of a gyroscope in principle, fidget spinners come with similar effects enabling a player to pull various tricks and stunts while forces of a gyroscope take hold. A fidget spinner can be balanced on top of fingers, thrown and caught, and so on.  Origin  As of 2017, the patent status of the various fidget spinners on the market was unclear. Catherine Hettinger, a chemical engineer by training, was initially credited by some news stories as having been the inventor of the fidget spinner, including by media outlets such as The Guardian, The New York Times, and the New York Post. Hettinger filed a patent application for a \\"spinning toy\\" in 1993 and a patent was issued, but Hettinger allowed the patent to lapse in 2005 after she could not find a commercial partner. A May 2017 Bloomberg News article showed that Hettinger was not the inventor of the fidget spinner, and Hettinger agreed. In an interview appearing on 4 May 2017 on NPR, Scott McCoskery described how he invented a metal spinning device in 2014 to cope with his own fidgeting in IT meetings and conference calls. In response to requests from an online community, he began selling the device he called the Torqbar online. Popularity and adolescent usage Google Search popularity of fidget spinners in early 2017. With the rapid increase in the popularity of fidget spinners in 2017, many children and teenagers began using them in school, and some schools also reported that students were trading and selling the spinner toys. As a result of their frequent use by school children, many school districts banned the toy. Some teachers argued that the spinners distracted students from their schoolwork. According to a survey conducted by Alexi Roy and published in May 2017, 32% of the largest 200 American public and private high schools had banned spinners on campus. When fidget spinners rose in popularity in 2017, many publications in the popular press discussed the marketing claims made about them for people with ADHD, autism, or anxiety. However, there is no scientific evidence that fidget spinners are effective as a treatment for children with ADHD. They quickly fell in popularity and sales after peaking in May 2017.

Unfortunately, he suffered an injury on his next game against Balestier Khalsa, DPMM conceded two goals after his substitution to lose 0‚Äì2 at the Hassanal Bolkiah National Stadium to hand Tampines Rovers the league title. The injury ultimately curtailed his development, as he would manage only two substitute appearances for the next two seasons. He had to repeat his Cooper test in 2014 and was released at the conclusion of that season. Nurul Azami made several appearances for Kota Ranger FC in the 2015 Brunei Premier League and scored a goal against BSRC FT in a 3-2 victory. The Rangers finished the season unbeaten at the top of the league and won promotion to the 2016 Brunei Super League.

The Mendelian nature of the trait was further disproven when case studies showed that the Phenotype of synesthesia could be differentially expressed in monozygotic (genotypically identical) twins While both twins had the same genome with the potential for phenotypic expression of synesthesia, only one had documented synesthesia. Therefore, the condition is now thought to be oligogenic, with Locus heterogeneity and multiple forms of inheritance, and expression, implying that synesthesia is determined by more than one gene, more than one location in those genes, and a complex mode of inheritance. Several full genome linkage scans have shown particular areas of the genome whose inheritance seem to correlate with the inheritance of synesthesia. Using the LOD score which describes the likelihood that two genes are near each other on a chromosome, and thus will be inherited together, areas of strong or suggestive linkage with inheritance of synesthesia were found. The area with the highest LOD score in the genome of an individual with auditory-visual synesthesia has been shown to be linked with autism as well, another disorder with sensory and perceptual abnormalities. Other regions of linkage include genes that are related to the development of the cerebral cortex (TBR1), dyslexia, and apoptosis (EFHC1), the last of which could be potentially related to the retention of the neonatal synesthetic pathways in the universal synesthesia/pruning hypothesis. This hypothesis posits that every person is born a synesthete and the ‚Äòextra‚Äô connections are pruned during normal neurodevelopment in non-synesthetes, and not pruned in synesthetes. More potential support for that hypothesis comes from another region identified with strong linkage, which contains a gene (DPYSL3) which is involved in axonal growth, neuroplasticity, and neuronal differentiation. Additionally, this gene is not expressed in the adult brain but is highly expressed in the late-fetal and early post-natal brain and spinal cord, providing more support for a universal ‚Äúneonatal synesthesia‚Äù that is pruned away through natural development. Another genome scan revealed a different area of linkage for an individual with colored sequence synesthesia: one which associates days of the week with colors. In that individual, the linked region contained genes that produces proteins important for intercellular communication (GABARAPL2), genes that are involved in brain development (NDRG4), genes linked to neuron myelination (PLLP), genes that produce enzymes involved in neuronal pruning (KATNB1), genes that produce Apoptosis inhibitors expressed in fetal brains (CIAPIN1), and genes that produce proteins that have differential expression in individuals with schizophrenia (GNAO1). Due to the prevalence of synesthesia among the first-degree relatives of synesthetes, there is evidence that synesthesia might have a genetic basis, however the monozygotic twins case studies indicate there is an epigenetic component. Synesthesia might also be an oligogenic condition, with Locus heterogeneity, multiple forms of inheritance (including Mendelian in some cases), and continuous variation in gene expression.

The course is designed at the European Astronaut Center to prepare astronauts for safe and efficient long duration spaceflight operations by means of a realistic scientific and exploration mission within a multicultural, ISS-representative team. Each training implementation last for approximately two weeks. In the first week, the so- called \\"cavenauts\\" are provided with the necessary scientific knowledge and technical skills to work effectively and safely in the underground environment and visit some simple caves to get acquainted with the condition they will find during their expedition. Afterwards, they spend six uninterrupted days exploring a complex cave system. The main purpose of the mission is to foster their communication, decision-making, problem-solving, leadership and team dynamics capabilities by means of team processes and a real crew mission performed in a space-like environment.  Location  CAVES takes place in several caves in the Italian island of Sardinia, part of a Karst System which lie within the Supramonte region of the Gennargentu National Park. Rocks most commonly found in the area are limestone and dolomite.  Objectives  Astronauts looking for microbiological samples in cave. The CAVES training uphold the following training objectives for participants: * Working together effectively in a challenging environment, * Adapting to a lack of comfort and privacy, * Exploring the cave, * Conducting scientific and technological research, * Managing logistical problems and coping with limited resources, * Facing the psychological effects of the mission, * Handling critical situations, * Being aware of safety requirements at all times, * Training the participants in leadership skills.  A space analogue  Microbiological sample The cave environment is an exceptional space analogue, as it allows to recreate, on Earth, most of the stress elements and specific characteristics encountered in long duration spaceflight. Such peculiar elements include: * Unknown / unfamiliar environment ‚Äì The crew knows about the cave only what previous expeditions have found and documented * Permanent darkness / need for artificial illumination * Lack of time parameters ‚Äì This is a direct consequence of the condition of permanent darkness in the cave * Alteration of circadian rhythm and sleep disturbance ‚Äì The lack of time references and limited facilities affect sleep quality and cycles length * Sensory alteration / deprivation ‚Äì Not only caves are lightless, they also provide almost no auditory or olfactory stimuli * Limited privacy ‚Äì Small, confined spaces do not offer much room for privacy or to keep spaces between team members * Social and cultural aspects / crew size ‚Äì The team includes with astronauts from ESA, NASA, ROSCOSMOS, CSA, JAXA and CNSA, so the team dynamics that emerge during the mission are similar to those expected on an international cooperative space mission * Limited resources / hygiene ‚Äì The transportation logistics inside the cave is extremely complex, only limited supplies can be carried inside * Isolation / Limited communication with outside world ‚Äì The crew can only rely on a telephone line up to just beyond the basecamp or radio devices working only in specific locationsAstronaut in a squeeze during the caves training. * Large level of autonomy ‚Äì This is a direct consequence of the isolation condition, the crew need to operate with minimal inputs from outside * Real physical danger ‚Äì Even implementing all reasonable safety measures, caves still present risks of falling, slipping, rocks tumbling down, being blocked by landslides and floodings, and participants need to pay constant attention to these aspects * Limited mission abort / rescue capabilities ‚Äì Given the complexity of the environment, both evacuation and rescue operations require several hours or even days to plan Another analogue aspect concerns astronauts progression, i.e. how they move inside the cave. The employed speleological techniques involve safety principles similar to that of EVA, such as the need to be attached to a safe surface ‚Äì the cave wall in CAVES, the ISS or the vehicle in space. Last, the crew mission performed during the exploration has several elements in common with the ISS operations, including a time-lined sequence of activities, daily planning calls to the ground support team, standardized procedures and data collection forms.  Crew mission  In the same way astronauts in space spend a consistent part of their time doing science, cavenauts are tasked to perform a real crew mission comprising several different experiments and activities while exploring the cave. Conducting scientific and technological research is the secondary objectives of the CAVES course, in addition to team training. A third one consists in exploring and documenting previously unknown areas of the cave. = Mission programme = Geology (analysis of water chemical and physical properties, counting of drip rate) Environment (measurement of temperature / relative humidity / wind / pressure / CO2 concentration / radon concentration)283x283px Microbiology (sampling of micro-organisms in soil and on surfaces for later cultivation) Biology (counting and sampling of cave terrestrial and aquatic fauna, search for micro-crustaceans, search for fauna in the soil) Technology testing (underground communication devices, physiology sensors) Cave documentation (photos and 3D survey of the cave, photogrammetry modeling of relevant speleothems) = Results = One of the most remarkable scientific results is the discovery of a previously unknown species of crustaceans of the genus Alpioniscus living in the cave.

The experiment involved an online canvas located at a subreddit called r/place, which registered users could edit by changing the color of a single pixel from a 16-colour palette. After each pixel was placed, a timer prevented the user from placing any pixels for a period of time varying from 5 to 20 minutes. The experiment was ended by Reddit administrators about 72 hours after its creation, on April 3, 2017. Over 1 million users edited the canvas, placing a total of approximately 16 million tiles, and, at the time the experiment was ended, over 90,000 users were actively viewing or editing. The experiment was commended for its representation of the culture of Reddit‚Äôs online communities, and of Internet culture as a whole.  Experiment  The experiment was based in a subreddit called /r/place, in which registered users could place a single coloured pixel (or \\"tile\\") on an empty canvas of one million (1000x1000) pixel squares, and wait a certain amount of time before placing another. The waiting time varied from 5 to 20 minutes throughout the experiment, and the user could choose their pixel‚Äôs colour from a palette of sixteen colours. The early hours of the experiment were characterized by random pixel placement and chaotic attempts at image creation. Among the first distinct sections of the canvas to emerge were a corner of entirely blue pixels (named \\"Blue Corner\\") and a homage to Pok√©mon. As the canvas developed, some established subreddit communities, such as those for video games, sports teams and individual countries, coordinated user efforts to claim and decorate particular sections. Other sections of the canvas were developed by communities and coordination efforts created specifically for the event. Several works of pixel art sprouted from the collaboration of these communities, varying from fictional characters and internet memes to patriotic flags, LGBT flags, and recreations of famous pieces of artwork such as Mona Lisa and The Starry Night. Several \\"cults\\" also formed to create and maintain various emblematic features such as a black void, green lattice, and a multi- colored \\"rainbow road\\". At the time of the experiment‚Äôs end on April 3, 2017, over 90,000 users were viewing and editing the canvas, and over one million users had placed a total of approximately 16 million tiles.  Reception  The idea of Place was commended for its colorful representation of the Reddit online community. The A.V. Club called it \\"a benign, colorful way for Redditors to do what they do best: argue among each other about the things that they love\\". The Foundation for Economic Education described it as a \\"microcosm of the emergent, spontaneous order that characterize[s] society\\", with Gizmodo labelling it as a \\"testament to the internet's ability to collaborate\\". A number of commentators described the experiment as a broader representation of Internet culture. Some also commented on the apparent relationship between the makeup of the final canvas and the individual communities within Reddit, which exist independently but cooperate as part of a larger community. Newsweek called it \\"the internet's best experiment yet\\", and a writer at Ars Technica suggested that the cooperative spirit of Place represented a model for fighting extremism in internet communities. The experiment did receive some criticism for the lack of protection from bot usage and the automated placing of pixels.

The town was reported to have been struck by an airstrike by government forces followed by massive civilian chemical poisoning. The release of a toxic gas, which included sarin, or a similar substance, killed at least 89 people and injured more than 541, according to the opposition Idlib Health Directorate. The attack was the deadliest use of chemical weapons in the Syrian civil war since the Ghouta chemical attack in 2013. The OPCW-UN Joint Investigative Mechanism attributed the responsibility of the attack to the Syrian government.Both ISIL and Syrian Government responsible for use of chemical weapons, UN Security Council told , UN News Centre, 7 November 2017UN panel blames Syrian forces for Khan Sheikhoun attack , Al-Jazeera, 27 October 2017Syrian government to blame for April sarin attack - U.N. report , Reuters, 26 October 2017The Guardian, 23 January 2018 russia bears responsibility The OPCW-UN JIM described chemicals that it said linked the sarin used to the Syrian government: \\"The samples from Khan Shaykhun contain the three types of marker chemicals described above: PF6 [HFP], isopropyl phosphates and isopropyl phosphorofluoridates. Their presence is a strong indicator that the sarin disseminated in Khan Shaykhun was produced from DF from the Syrian Arab Republic stockpile.\\" The governments of the United States, United Kingdom, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, France, and Israel as well as Human Rights Watch attributed the attack to the forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The Syrian government said the attack was a \\"fabrication\\". The Russian government claimed that the incident was staged. On 7 April, the United States launched 59 cruise missiles at Shayrat Air Base, which U.S. intelligence claimed was the source of the attack.US strikes on Syrian base: what we know ‚Äì AFP. Retrieved 4 April 2018. Background Use of chemical weapons in the Syrian Civil War has been confirmed by the local sources in Syria and by the United Nations. Deadly attacks by chemical weapons during the war include the Ghouta attack in the suburbs of Damascus in August 2013 and the Khan al-Assal attack in the suburbs of Aleppo in March 2013. While no party took responsibility for the chemical attacks, a U.N. fact- finding mission and a UNHRC Commission of Inquiry have both investigated the attacks. The U.N. mission found likely use of the nerve agent sarin in the case of Khan al-Asal (19 March 2013), Saraqib (29 April 2013), Ghouta (21 August 2013), Jobar (24 August 2013) and Ashrafiyat Sahnaya (25 August 2013). The UNHRC commission later confirmed the use of sarin in the Khan al-Asal, Saraqib and Ghouta attacks, but did not mention the Jobar and the Ashrafiyat Sahnaya attacks. The UNHRC commission also found the sarin used in the Khan al-Asal attack bore \\"the same unique hallmarks\\" as the sarin used in the Ghouta attack and indicated the perpetrators likely had access to chemicals from the Syrian Army's stockpile. Those attacks prompted the international community to pressure disarmament of the Syrian Armed Forces from chemical weapons, which was executed during 2014. Despite the disarmament process, dozens of incidents with suspected use of chemical weapons followed throughout Syria, the majority being attributed to anti-government fighters, in particular the Al Qaeda affiliate Al Nusra Front. In August and October 2016, United Nations reports explicitly blamed the Syrian military of Bashar al- Assad for dropping chlorine bombs on the towns of Talmenes on 21 April 2014, Sarmin on 16 March 2015.Syria Used Chlorine in Bombs Against Civilians, Report Says . Retrieved 25 August 2016. and Qmenas, also on 16 March 2015.https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/N1634106%20%281%29.pdf (fourth report of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons- United Nations Joint Investigative Mechanism) Several other attacks have been alleged, reported and/or investigated. In December 2016, at least 53 people were killed in an alleged chemical weapons attack in ISIL-held villages near Uqairabat that bore similarities to the Ghouta attack, with none of the dead having blast injuries. The immediate context for the Khan Shaykhun attack was the intensified aerial campaign in March and April 2017 by the government and its Russian ally to gain control of Kafr Zeita, Murek and al-Lataminah, then the three remaining rebel-held towns in the northern Hama Governorate.Report of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic , 8 August 2017 (See Hama offensive (March‚ÄìApril 2017).) On 30 March 2017, an airstrike hit al-Lataminah, around from Khan Shaykhun. More than 70 people in the area were then exposed to an unidentified chemical agent and showed symptoms of nausea, agitation, foaming, muscle spasm, and miosis (constriction of the pupil of the eye). Cardiac arrest occurred in two of the victims and an orthopedic doctor died. On 3 April 2017, one day before the Khan Shaykhun attack, a \\"regime aircraft\\" allegedly carried out a similar chlorine gas attack on Al-Habit, a nearby village, injuring dozens and killing two children. Attack Map showing frontlines at the time of the attack, with the location of the strike marked by the hatched circle The attack took place around 6:30 a.m. local time on 4 April, before most children and parents had left for school or work. Witnesses reported smelling a strange odor about ten minutes after a rocket attack and airstrike, followed by visible symptoms of poisoning. White Helmets volunteers reported four unusually weak explosions. Medical workers and witnesses said the attack was different than the chlorine gas attacks they had experienced in the past, in which the chlorine gas usually killed a few people in confined spaces and buildings. In contrast, in this attack, many people died outside. Furthermore, the victims exhibited pinpoint pupils, a sign of contact with nerve agents and sarin specifically. Other symptoms reported included coldness in the extremities, decreased heart rate, and low blood pressure. Some first responders became ill when they came into contact with the victims. Rescue workers gathered soil and tissue samples and sent them to Western intelligence officials for analysis. On 6 April, the Turkish Ministry of Health, which had conducted tests on people transported to Turkey, said it had identified the chemical used in the attack as sarin, citing lung damage found in victims. On 11 April, Turkish Minister of Health Recep Akdaƒü stated that isopropyl methylphosphonic acid‚Äîa known byproduct of sarin reacting with other compounds‚Äîwas \\"identified in the blood and urine tests conducted on samples taken from the victims\\". Tests by British scientists of samples found at the scene indicated the chemical involved was \\"sarin or a sarin-like substance\\". Kareem Shaheen, the first reporter from western media to visit the town after the attack, photographed the crater where the chemical weapon was reported to have hit an apparently abandoned warehouse and silos near the crater. =Casualties= Medical sources in Idlib in the immediate aftermath of the attack reported more than 58 people, including 11 children, were killed and over 300 were wounded. Test results of samples collected from ten of them indicated they had been exposed to sarin or a sarin-like substance. By 7:30 a.m. EEST 100 wounded people arrived at a local field hospital. The opposition minister of health, Mohamad Firas al-Jundi, said victims experienced suffocation, fluid in the lungs, foaming at the mouth, unconsciousness, spasm, and paralysis. A few hours after the attack, a nearby clinic treating victims was hit by an airstrike, with reports that Russians bombed the hospital with the victims in an attempt to destroy the evidence. The area's largest hospital was bombed two days prior. According to Dr. Abdel Hay Tennari, who treated 22 victims of the attack, the symptoms of victims corresponded to symptoms of exposure to sarin. Patients who received pralidoxime, an antidote of sarin, reportedly stabilized their medical state in around an hour. M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res visited Bab Al Hawa hospital where they determined symptoms consistent with sarin. They also visited other hospitals where victims were taken and reported, \\"that victims smelled of bleach, suggesting they had been exposed to chlorine.\\" They concluded that the \\"reports strongly suggest that victims of the attack on Khan Sheikhoun were exposed to at least two different chemical agents.\\" On 5 April, local doctors and rescue workers at the scene said the number of dead had risen to 74, with 600 injured, while Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan and French Ambassador to the United Nations Fran√ßois Delattre said over 100 had died. On 7 April, the opposition Idlib Health Directorate said 89 had died, 18 women and 33 children. On 9 May 2017, a report from CNN said the attack killed 92 people in all. Responsibility On 6 September 2017, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights' Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic concluded that a Syrian Air Force aircraft was responsible the sarin attack, saying \\"the Syrian air force used sarin in Khan Sheikhoun, Idlib, killing dozens, the majority of whom were women and children\\". It dismissed claims by Damascus and Moscow that a bomb struck an opposition chemical weapons depot on the outskirts of the northern town as ‚Äúfabricated‚Äù. The report found that a Sukhoi 22 jet, which is only flown by the Syrian airforce, had carried out four airstrikes at 6.45am on 4 April. Three bombs carried conventional explosives, but one, which struck a road, carried the deadly nerve agent, which was carried as far as 600 metres away on a gentle wind. ‚ÄúWeather conditions at 6.45am on 4 April were ideal for delivering a chemical weapon,‚Äù the report said. ‚ÄúThe wind speed was just over 3km/h, with no rain and practically no cloud cover. Under such conditions, the agent cloud would have drifted slowly downhill following the terrain features at the location.‚Äù The Assad government has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons, but the report said the Syrian regime‚Äôs version of events, that an unknown weapons depot had been hit, was ‚Äúextremely unlikely‚Äù. It said sarin stored in such circumstances would have mostly burned off or been absorbed by rubble, and that there was no evidence of the building being contaminated. A visit by The Guardian to Khan Sheikhun two days after the attack revealed that the site officials claimed had been hit had been empty for many months, and contained only animal feed and a volleyball net. Witnesses described the frantic aftermath of a series of airstrikes, which overwhelmed the limited capacity of local medics and rescue workers. This finding was confirmed in a report released on 26 October 2017 by the OPCW-UN Joint Investigative Mechanism. Many governments, such as the United States and some European countries and the Gulf Cooperation Council attributed the attack to the Syrian government. According to investigation by Human Rights Watch, the attack was conducted by Syrian government forces from the air using Soviet-made KhAB-250 aerial bombs designed to deliver sarin. Bellingcat suggested Russia may have inadvertently provided evidence of the Syrian government's use of the M4000 chemical bomb.Bellingcat, 24 September 2019 type of chemical bomb used in syrias sarin attacks The Syrian government denied any involvement. Immediately following the attacks, Russia said the Syrian Air Force had struck Khan Shaykhun \\"between 11:30am and 12:30pm local time\\" on 4 April, but that the target had been \\"a large terrorist ammunition depot\\" on its eastern outskirts. \\"On the territory of the depot, there were workshops which produced chemical warfare munitions\\", and following the OPCW conclusions, in October 2017, it strongly disputed the conclusion that the Syrian government was responsible. The UN Security Council session unanimously declared the need for an investigation of the chemical attack. According to an OPCW report, an investigation into the attack was concluded and released on 29 June 2017, which confirmed the use of sarin gas, or a similar substance. Claims by the Syrian government, Syrian opposition and Russian government =Syrian opposition claims= According to the Idlib Media Centre, the chemical agent had the characteristics of sarin. The National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces accused the Syrian government and the Syrian Armed Forces of carrying out the attack and called for an immediate investigation by the United Nations Security Council. The opposition groups said the Syrian air force dropped chemical bombs on a civilian population. =Syrian government claims= On the day of the attack, a Syrian government official told Reuters \\"the government does not and has not used chemical weapons, not in the past and not in the future.\\" Later, the Russian Ministry of Defence reiterated the statement made by the Syrian Armed Forces, and said the attack on the ammunition depot took place between 11:30 and 12:30 EEST. In a 13 April interview to AFP, President Assad said the attack is \\"100 per cent fabrication\\" by the United States \\"working hand-in-glove with the terrorists\\", intended to provide a pretext for the airstrike on the Shayrat Airbase. =Russian government claims= The Russian government denied involvement in the chemical attack; Russia's Defence Ministry issued a statement saying the Russian Air Force had \\"not carried out any strikes near Khan Shaykhun of Idlib province\\", but said a Syrian aircraft did conduct an airstrike on a warehouse containing ammunition and equipment belonging to rebels near Khan Shaykhun, \\"yesterday, from 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m\\". The Russian Foreign Ministry said it was \\"premature to accuse the Syrian government of using chemical weapons in Idlib\\", and insist on full and impartial investigation. Shortly after the attack Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters the use of chemical weapons is a \\"dangerous and monstrous crime\\" and that Russia's support for Assad is not \\"unconditional\\". He also said he doubted information was based on \\"objective materials or evidence\\", and that only Syrian government can resist \\"terrorists on the ground.\\"\\"West Keeps Pressure On Russia Over Suspected Syria Chemical Attack\\" . Radio Free Europe/Radio Free Liberty. 6 April 2017. Mikhail Ulyanov, head of the Russian delegation to UNGA First Committee and Director of the Department for Non-Proliferation and Arms Control of the MFA of Russia, stated on the sidelines of the 72nd session of the UN General Assembly that Russia tended to 'more and more to opt for that version' that explained the event as a staged incident, and to doubt that it was the result of an air bomb strike. Bellingcat October 27, 2017 russias denials syrias sarin Later, President Vladimir Putin said the attack could be a provocation, but that several versions were possible, and the UN should investigate the attack. On 11 April, Putin suggested the chemical attack was a false flag operation intended to discredit the Syrian government. UK based Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins observed that Russian claims that a warehouse containing chemical weapons was bombed related to a raid carried out \\"two to three hours\\" after the first images of victims appeared. A statement made on the day of the attack by Major General Igor Konashenkov, a spokesperson for the Russian Ministry of Defence was also criticised by Higgins' Bellingcat colleague Dan Kaszeta, a veteran of the US Army Reserve's Chemical Corps, who called it \\"an infantile argument\\", and by the anti-Kremlin Russian non-profit Conflict Intelligence Team. United States reaction =Responsibility assessment= According to the US government, the Syrian government under Assad was behind the chemical attack, and Syrian jets carried out the bombing of a rebel stronghold. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was quoted as saying \\"Either Russia has been complicit or Russia has been simply incompetent\\". According to Tillerson, the U.S. appealed to Assad to cease the use of chemical weapons, and \\"[o]ther than that, there is no change to our military posture\\", with ISIS remaining the primary priority. President Donald Trump called the attack \\"reprehensible\\" and attributed it to the Syrian government, saying the act could not be ignored \\"by the civilized world\\" during his meeting with King Abdullah II of Jordan.Alexander Smith, Syria Gas Attack Reportedly Kills Dozens in Idlib Province , NBC News (4 April 2017). Trump also blamed the attack on supposed failures of the administration of his predecessor, Barack Obama.Andrew Rafferty & Stacey Klein, Trump Pins Blame for Syrian Attack on Obama Administration , NBC News (4 April 2017). U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said: \\"Anyone who uses chemical weapons to attack his own people shows a fundamental disregard for human decency and must be held accountable.\\"Chemical Weapons Attack in Syria (press release), United States Department of State (4 April 2017). US representative to the UN Nikki Haley has stated that, though before the chemical attack the US had not considered overthrowing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from power a top US priority, it is now prominent among US priorities in the region. At the UN Security Council, Haley said \\"When the United Nations consistently fails in its duty to act collectively, there are times in the life of states that we are compelled to take our own action\\", by it implying if the UN failed to hold Assad accountable for the use of chemical weapons on civilians, the US will. CIA Director Mike Pompeo confirmed on Thursday 13 April that his agency concluded the Syrian government was responsible for the chemical attack in Khan Shaykhun. ‚ÄúWe were good and fast,‚Äù Pompeo said. The top Democrat on the house intelligence committee, Rep. Adam Schiff, agreed that the Syrian government was responsible for the attack. A few members of Congress and former officials expressed skepticism, like Democratic Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, Republican Congressman Thomas Massie, and former Republican Congressman Ron Paul. =Missile strike= firing a Tomahawk missile towards the Shayrat Airbase On the morning of 7 April 2017, 72 hours after the attack, the United States launched 59 cruise missiles on Shayrat Airbase, a Syrian airfield near Shayrat, believed to be the base for the aircraft that carried out the chemical attack. In contrast to the coalition's accidental air raid on Deir ez-Zor in 2016, this was both a unilateral action and the first intentional strike against the Syrian government. =Sanctions= On 24 April 2017, the United States Department of the Treasury imposed sanctions on 271 employees of the Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Center for their alleged role in producing chemical weapons. International reactions =Supranational and non-governmental organizations= Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres said he was \\"deeply disturbed\\" by reports of the Idlib chemical attack, noting that the use of chemical weapons is banned under international law.Syria: UN chief 'deeply disturbed' by reports of alleged chemical attack; OPCW investigating , UN News Centre (4 April 2016). Federica Mogherini, the European Union's diplomatic chief, called the attack \\"awful\\" and said Bashar al-Assad's government bore \\"primary responsibility\\" for it.

On 26 October, an investigative panel created by the UN Security Council said it was \\"confident\\" that Assad's air force was behind the chemical attack.

United States Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, serving as president of the Security Council for the month, announced there would not be a vote on a draft resolution to respond to the chemical weapons attack, but instead of one resolution by the U.S. and a second resolution by Russia, there was a third resolution unexpectedly submitted by Sweden and nine other non-permanent members. When the council concluded its meeting without conclusion on the morning of 6 April, the U.S. launched a missile strike. On 12 April, the proposed draft resolution was vetoed by Russia as it attributed blame to the Syrian government before any investigation had been undertaken. This was the eighth time that Russia vetoed a Security Council resolution on Syria.Euan McKirdy, 8 times Russia blocked a UN Security Council resolution on Syria , CNN (13 April 2017).Somini Sengupta, Russia Vetoes U.N. Resolution Condemning Syria Chemical Attack , New York Times (12 April 2017). Instead, on 20 April, Russia and Iran formally proposed to start an OPCW investigation (which was rejected as an investigation is already in progress) and then on 26 April blocked UN resolution calling Syria to disclose information for the first OPCW investigation at the same accusing UN of \\"blocking independent international investigation\\" earlier proposed by Russia and Iran. On 26 April 2017, French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said France had concluded that the Syrian government was \\"unquestionably\\" the perpetrator of the attack. He added that the same mixture of sarin and hexamine had been used in the 2013 Saraqib chemical attack. United Kingdom government defense minister, Michael Fallon said he believed the Syrian air force responsible for the attack. Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn said \\"There should now be an immediate ceasefire and a UN-led investigation rapidly into what is a horrific and totally illegal action by somebody using chemical weapons against innocent people.\\" The Egyptian Foreign Ministry released a statement saying the \\"painful and unacceptable\\" images of the massacre reaffirm the necessity of reaching a political solution to end the crisis in Syria, in light of the international community decisions and Security Council Resolution 2254, as well as the Geneva Conventions. = Other countries = Iranian President Hassan Rouhani called for an \\"impartial international fact-finding body\\" to be set up to investigate the attack. Foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif described the incident as \\"very painful\\" and condemned it, but also criticized US for attacking the Syrian airbase \\"without any investigation\\". Iranian Foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Ghassemi condemned \\"all use of chemical weapons,\\" but suggested the blame for the attack lay with \\"terrorist groups\\" rather than the Syrian government. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said: \\"There are continuing questions ... about who is responsible for these horrible attacks against civilians, and that's why I'm impressing on the UN Security Council to pass a strong resolution that allows the international community to determine first of all who was responsible for these attacks and how we will move forward.\\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called on the international community \\"to fulfill its obligation from 2013 to fully and finally remove these horrible weapons from Syria\\". Other countries who condemned the chemical attack include the Czech Republic, Italy, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and the Vatican City. The Iraqi government condemned the chemical attack and called for an \\"initiative aimed at punishing those responsible\\". The next day, Iraqi cleric Muqtada al-Sadr also condemned the attacks and called for President Assad to step down. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said if al-Assad was found to be behind the attack, as the United States believe, it represented \\"a shocking war crime.\\" Other countries who accused Assad for responsibility include Qatar and Turkey.  Other views  Former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Hans Blix, described the US retaliation as \\"measured\\" and specific, but later criticized the rapid American military response.

He initially raised concern that the responsibility of the Syrian government was not yet proven, but stated on 11 April 2017, \\"On balance it seems probable that the attack with gas was undertaken by the Syrian government air force,\\" adding that \\"the factual circumstances known so far do not point to the rebels as arranging the gas action\\". Other people who have expressed skepticism of the Syrian government being responsible for the attack include former UN weapons inspector Scott Ritter, US based weapons expert and MIT professor emeritus Theodore Postol, former UK ambassador to Syria and director of the British Syrian Society Peter Ford, investigative Israeli journalist Uri Avneri via AsiaNews, an official news channel of the Vatican,The 'bizarre case' of Bashar al-Assad and nerve gas Vatican - Asianewsaccess-date=2017-07-09 and investigative journalist Seymour Hersh. The OPCW-UN JIM report found no merit in any of these views and concluded that the sarin used in the attack bore the Syrian regime's signature; 'the Leadership Panel is confident that the Syrian Arab Republic is responsible for the release of sarin at Khan Shaykhun on 4 April 2017. In 2019, the Princeton based journal Science & Global Security, on whose editorial board Ted Postol sat,al-bab.com Brian Whitaker, postol resigns intended to publish a report titled \\"Computational Forensic Analysis for the Chemical Weapons Attack at Khan Sheikhoun on 4 April 2017\\" written by Goong Chen, Cong Gu, Theodore A. Postol, Alexey Sergeev, Sanyang Liu, Pengfei Yao and Marlan O. Scully. The report questioned the findings of the UN/OPCW investigation which concluded that the Assad regime had used sarin. The report‚Äôs arguments were rebutted in a Bellingcat article that detailed inconsistencies and anomalies in the report‚Äôs analysis. In response to the Bellingcat article, the editors of Science & Global Security said ‚ÄúRegrettably, the Bellingcat group blog post contains a number of incorrect statements about the contents and conclusions of the paper to be published. Some of the statements appear to refer to an earlier manuscript and do not take account of all the changes made during the peer review and editorial process managed by this journal‚Äù.

Formed in the summer of 1941, the division fought in the Battle of Moscow, the Battle of Kursk, the Battle of Smolensk and the Battle of Berlin. The 283rd was disbanded in 1946, after the end of the war.  History  The 283rd began forming from reservists on 15 July 1941 at Shchigry in the Orel Military District. Its basic order of battle included the 856th, 858th, and 860th Rifle Regiments, as well as the 848th Artillery Regiment. In early September, it was sent to the front, where it was assigned to Arkady Yermakov's operational group of the Bryansk Front. In October, during Operation Typhoon, the German assault on Moscow, the 283rd was transferred to the 3rd Army, with which it served during the rest of the war with only one small interruption. After the Bryansk Front was disbanded, the division became part of the Southwestern Front in late 1941. In February 1942, the 848th Artillery Regiment became the 9th Guards Artillery Regiment. The division was later transferred back to the new formation of the Bryansk Front, with which it served until October 1943. In late 1943, the 283rd fought in the operations that forced the German Army Group Centre to retreat back to the Dnieper. In February 1944, the division briefly transferred to the 1st Belorussian Front's 50th Army, but a month later it returned to the 3rd Army. At this point the division had suffered so much attrition that each rifle battalion had only two rifle companies, one machine gun company, and one mortar company. The division fought in Operation Bagration in June and July as part of the 80th Rifle Corps. In late July the 3rd Army moved to the 2nd Belorussian Front, advancing into the Baltic states. The 3rd Army became part of the 3rd Belorussian Front in February 1945. In late April, the 3rd Army became part of the 1st Belorussian Front, and the 283rd was assigned to the 41st Rifle Corps, serving as the front reserve in the Berlin Offensive. Postwar, the division was relocated to Stowbtsy in the Minsk (later Belorussian) Military District, where the 41st Rifle Corps became part of the 28th Army.

Early life Lagden was born at Yetminster, Dorset, the son of Reverend Richard Dowse Lagden of Balsham House, Cambridgeshire and was educated at Sherborne School. He joined the British civil service as a clerk in the General Post Office where he worked from 1869 to 1877, when he decided to move to South Africa. Career in Africa There he was introduced to the South African High Commissioner Sir Bartle Frere who sent him to the Transvaal Republic which had been newly annexed by Sir Theophilus Shepstone. There he would be initially appointed to its executive council. He entered the colonial secretary's office in Pretoria and was private secretary to the new Administrator of the Transvaal, Sir Owen Lanyon, 1878‚Äì81. Lagden and Lanyon were in Pretoria when the town was besieged during the First Boer War. After the war, Lanyon was recalled to London, but Lagden remained and was briefly private secretary to Sir Evelyn Wood before returning to England in 1882. There he was engaged as war correspondent for the Daily Telegraph in Egypt, covering the British campaign against the ‚ÄòUrabi Revolt. He was one of a small party that entered Cario ahead of the main force to demand its surrender. He took part in the charge at Kassassin and would deliver information essential to Sir Garnet Wolseley in his efforts to harass the army of Ahmed  ªUrabi and its eventual fall at the Battle of Tell El Kebir. On his return in 1883, he was appointed Assistant Colonial Secretary in Sierra Leone but was sent to do some brief work in the Gold Coast. On the completion of the work there he was ordered to return to Sierra Leone by the Governor Sir Samuel Rowe. He decided to take leave instead and visited Kumasi, the first by a white man in twenty years, where he was captured and tried and he then escaped after being sentenced to die. After that, he fell out with the governor Rowe, and was sacked by the Colonial Office. However, a friend he had made in Pretoria, Marshal Clarke, had just been appointed resident commissioner in Basutoland in 1884 and insisted that Lagden be re-engaged to work for him as his secretary, which he did and eventually succeeded Clarke as resident commissioner 1893‚Äì1901. In Basutoland, he managed to control the infighting between tribes in the country and succeed in establishing hut taxes and their collection. During the Second Boer War, which broke out in 1899, Lagden did all he could to keep Basutoland neutral ensuring the war did not draw in black soldiers. When he raised a force of 10,000 Basotho's and refused to use them to ensure the relief of Wepener other than to watch over the Cape Mounted Rifles, who were besieged by Boer forces until they were relieved by other British units. During the war, he raised and commanded the Transvaal Light Infantry. In 1901 he was appointed commissioner of native affairs by Lord Milner in the Transvaal Colony, by then under British control and was also a member of its executive and legislative councils. During 1903 until 1905, he was chairman of the South African Native Affairs Commission and took evidence from all over South Africa and Rhodesia. Later life He retired in 1907 after the Transvaal Colony gained self-rule and returned to Weybridge in England and served on various public bodies including the Royal Colonial Institute of which he was secretary and later vice-president, serving until 1923. Marriage He married Frances Rebekah Bousfield in 1887, the daughter of the Bishop of Pretoria.

Historiography  He is known for distinguishing periods in Icelandic history into golden ages, periods of decline and periods of humiliation. In A√∞ils‚Äôs narrative, the golden age begins with settlement in 874 (and reaches its high point during the Saga Age) and ends when Iceland falls under foreign rule (J√≥nsson 1903, 79, 88-89, 103, 105, 178).

A√∞ils' lessons were that under Icelandic rule, the nation was prosperous, productive and artistic, but suffered under foreign role. However, A√∞ils argued that within every Icelander, a desire for freedom and nationalism remained, and only had to be awoken.

The Amphorn Sathan Residential Hall or the Ambara Villa (: Phra Thinang Amphorn Sathan) is a royal mansion situated inside Bangkok's Dusit Palace. It serves as the current primary residence of King Vajiralongkorn (Rama X) and Queen Suthida of Thailand.  History  Construction began in 1890 on the order of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) who wanted a European style mansion built inside the Dusit Gardens. The residence was initially named the 'Ivory Garden' (). The name was later changed to the ‚ÄúAmphorn Sathan Residential Hall‚Äù or the Phra Thinang Amphorn Sathan; translated as: 'The royal seat in the sky'. Phraya Yommarat, Minister of Civil engineering of Siam was the director of construction in 1906 and celebrated the completion of the new building with a ceremony lasting from 18 to 22 February 1906. King Rama V lived in the residence and died there in 1910. Both kings Vajiravudh (Rama VI) and Prajadhipok (Rama VII) spent time in this residence during their respective reigns. When King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX) came back permanently from Switzerland in 1950, he decided to live in the Amphorn Sathan Residential Hall before his coronation ceremony. As renovations were being carried out in the preferred Chitralada Royal Villa, the king, Queen Sirikit and the growing royal family remained living at Amphorn Sathan. Once the renovations were completed at Chitralada in 1957, the king and the royal family moved out. During the royal couple's stay at the hall, three of their children were born here: Prince Vajiralongkorn on 28 July 1952, Princess Sirindhorn 2 April 1955 and Princess Chulabhorn 4 July 1957. King Vajiralongkorn with Italian ambassador Francesco Saverio Nisio inside Amphorn Sathan Residential Hall The residence is known to most Thais as the location of many of King Bhumibol's early musical broadcasts on the radio. In 1952 the king established the A.S. (Amporn Sathan) Radio Station. From the residence, the king would jam with various jazz musicians and his own band every Friday, including playing some of his own compositions. Pathorn Srikaranonda, one of the king's band member remembered that: \\"Anyone could call in to request music. If the band couldn't play that song, then he would play the record instead. He even answered the phone himself. People didn't know they were speaking to the King as His Majesty didn't like to reveal his presence\\". The king's band was called the 'A.S. Friday'. In 1972 Prince Vajiralongkorn was made Crown Prince of Thailand and was granted the residence by the king, as his official home. On the 7 December 1978 Princess Bajrakitiyabha, Vajiralongkorn's eldest child was born at the palace. On the 1 December 2016, Vajiralongkorn accepted the formal invitation from the President of the National Assembly of Thailand to accept the crown and become King Rama X inside residence's throne room.

He taught himself the violin, and at age 14 was taken on at the Sunderland Theatre. In 1784 he established himself at South Shields as a teacher, and in 1787 became leader at the Newcastle Theatre. In 1788 Sanderson went to London and led the orchestra at Astley's Theatre. He was engaged in 1793 by the Royal Circus as composer and musical director; he remained there many years, producing incidental music for dramas, and vocal and instrumental pieces. Sanderson worked closely with John Cartwright Cross, who usually provided words for a long series of burlettas, melodramas and pantomimes. Cross devised a way for the Royal Circus, which became the Surrey Theatre, to get round restrictions on the classic plays they could show: it involved rendering the lines into rhymed couplets, and adding musical accompaniment. Sanderson died about 1841. Works Sheet music for the presidential fanfare composed by James Sanderson. Sanderson began as a composer with instrumental accompaniment to William Collins's Ode on the Passions, which George Frederick Cooke recited at his benefit in Chester.

A ballad, Bound 'Prentice to a Waterman, sung in the drama Sir Francis Drake (1800), was regularly introduced into nautical plays for half a century.

As principal of GBQC, select major projects include Pender Labs at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, the Philadelphia Police Headquarters, the Liberty State Park master plan, the Philadelphia Center City master plan, and his best-known work, the Dining Commons, Birch Garden, and Academic Building at the Institute for Advanced Study. He is a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects; recipient of honorary doctorates from Princeton University, City College of New York, and the New Jersey School of Architecture/NJIT; recipient of the Topaz Award from the American Institute of Architects and the Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture, and, along with his firm, is the recipient of the Architecture Firm Award. Early life and education Geddes was born Robert Leon Goldberg on December 7, 1923 in Philadelphia, the only child of Louis J. Geddes (born Goldberg) and Kate Geddes (born Malmed), both of Ukrainian-Jewish families settled in Woodbine, New Jersey by Maurice de Hirsch. He grew up and attended elementary school in Ventnor City, New Jersey;Cook, Eugenia. \\"With an eye on the human element, an architect gives substance to ideas\\", The Philadelphia Inquirer, May 6, 1984. Accessed August 8, 2018. \\"Born in Philadelphia in 1923, he grew up in Ventnor.\\" John Burroughs Middle School in the Hancock Park, Los Angeles neighborhood of Los Angeles; and graduated from Atlantic City High School in 1941. He started university studies at the University of California, Berkeley, transferring to Yale University in the fall of 1942 due to concerns over transcontinental travel after the start of World War II. His university studies were interrupted by three years in the United States Army Air Forces from 1942 to 1945. He left Yale in 1947 for the Harvard Graduate School of Design, where he earned an M. Arch. in 1950. Professional career Architect In 1953, he co-founded a collaborative practice, Geddes Brecher Qualls Cunningham: Architects (also known as GBQC Architects), in Philadelphia, later adding an office in Princeton. Prior to founding GBQC, he worked briefly for Hugh Stubbins, Jr. in Cambridge, Massachusetts. GBQC won national and international competitions and awards, starting with being runner-up in the Sydney Opera House design competition (1955). He was GBQC design partner or co-partner for the Pender Labs at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania; the Police Headquarters of the City of Philadelphia; Richard Stockton College in New Jersey; Hill Hall at Rutgers University-Newark; the College of Liberal Arts of Southern Illinois University; the Architects Housing in Trenton, New Jersey; Princeton Community Housing‚Äôs Griggs Farm neighborhood; and probably best known, the Dining Hall and Birch Garden quad at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. He was elected a Fellow of the National Academy of Design, and GBQC was awarded the highest professional honor of the American Institute for Architects, the Architecture Firm Award (1979), for ‚Äúdesign quality, respect for the environment, and social concern.‚Äù Urbanist He was the urban design consultant for the Center City Plan of Philadelphia (1988), and for the Third Regional Plan of New York for the Regional Plan Association (1996). GBQC won first prize in the international design competition for Vienna-South urban extension (1972), and the GBQC master plan for Liberty State Park was exhibited in the Museum of Modern Art (1979). He worked with the City University of New York‚Äôs Newman Institute on alternatives for the Hudson Yards in midtown Manhattan. He co-founded the civic association, Princeton Future, which created the concept design for the new plaza, housing and parking in downtown Princeton, New Jersey. For the United Nations Center for Human Settlements, he directed the ‚ÄúUNCHS Conference on Cities in North America‚Äù, produced its report ‚ÄúCities in Our Future‚Äù, published by Island Press, and wrote for the journal American Prospect, ‚ÄúMetropolis Unbound: The Sprawling American City and the Search for Alternatives.‚Äù Educator After studying at the Harvard Graduate School of Design in the post-war Walter Gropius and Joseph Hudnut era, he taught architecture and civic design at the University of Pennsylvania School of Design (formerly University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Fine Arts) from 1951 to 1965. He moved to Princeton University in 1965 to become the first Dean of the School of Architecture, and is now William Kennan Professor Emeritus. Under his leadership over 17 years, the School of Architecture emerged as a major center for the exchange of architectural ideas, while retaining its small size and close connections with the rest of the university. In 1990, he was appointed the Henry Luce Professor of Architecture, Urbanism, and History at New York University, and was elected a Fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities. He pioneered in connecting architecture with the humanities and social sciences, and with public affairs and urban design, and is best known for his undergraduate course at Princeton and NYU, Architecture 101, ‚ÄúBuildings, Landscapes, and Cities.‚Äù He was co-author of the Princeton Report on Architectural Education for the American Institute of Architects (1967).

The division's first formation was formed in the summer of 1941 and destroyed in the Bryansk pocket in the fall of that year. The 282nd was quickly reformed in December 1941 in Siberia and moved west in the spring of 1942. The division fought in the Demyansk Pocket for the next year, and during Operation Bagration advanced into the Baltic states in the summer of 1944. Due to losses the 282nd spent the last months of 1944 in reserve and after receiving reinforcements reentered combat in January 1945, fighting in the Sandomierz‚ÄìSilesian Offensive, the Silesian Offensives, and the Prague Offensive before being disbanded after the end of the war in the summer of 1945.  History  = First Formation = The 282nd began forming around 10 July 1941 at Yuryev-Polsky in the Moscow Military District. Its basic order of battle included the 872nd, 874th, and 877th Rifle Regiments, and the 826th Artillery Regiment. On 15 August, the division, only partially formed, was moved west to Starodub, where it became part of the Bryansk Front. A commander was officially assigned to the division on 20 August. By 1 September, the division became part of the 3rd Army, which it remained part of for the rest of its existence. At the end of September, Operation Typhoon, the German assault on Moscow, began. The 282nd, like many Bryansk Front units, was encircled in the Bryansk pocket. On 13 October, elements of the 282nd, fighting alongside remnants of the 148th Rifle Division and the 280th Rifle Division, opened a 500 meter gap in the German encirclement west of Navlya. Although elements of the division were able to break out, the 282nd had effectively ceased to exist as a combat unit and was officially disbanded on 27 December. = Second Formation = Soviet positions at Demyansk, spring 1943. The 282nd was in the 11th Army sector to the west of the German salient The division's second formation began forming on 12 December 1941 at Omsk in the Siberian Military District, with the same basic order of battle as the previous formation. Major General Pankraty Beloborodov took command of the division. The division spent two months forming at Omsk, then was shipped west by train to Buy, where it was reinforced with workers from Leningrad on 26 February 1942. Spending another two months in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command, the division was assigned to the Northwestern Front's 11th Army, fighting in the Demyansk Pocket from late April. In February 1943 it was transferred to the 34th Army in the Staraya Russa area, and fought in the Staraya Russa Offensive. In April the 282nd was assigned to the 1st Shock Army, remaining there until the disbandment of the Northwestern Front on 20 November. The division was then transferred to the 6th Guards Army's 90th Rifle Corps, part of the 2nd Baltic Front. In January 1944, it was transferred to the 3rd Shock Army. The division became part of the 12th Guards Rifle Corps of the 1st Shock Army before the beginning of Operation Bagration in June 1944. On 10 June, Beloborodov was transferred to command the 23rd Guards Rifle Division, and the 23rd's commander, Colonel Andrei Kartavenko, became the 282nd's commander. Between 28 June and 2 July, Colonel Ivan Echepatov led the division, and was replaced by Colonel Andrei Shiryayev on 3 July. Holding positions in the Strezhnevsky bridgehead on the Velikaya River, the division fought in the Pskov-Ostrov Offensive from 12 July, during which it advanced through the Pskov region and into Latvia and Estonia. On 9 August, it became part of the 118th Rifle Corps, which was soon transferred to the 67th Army. Fighting in the Tartu Offensive in August, the division captured the key K√§revere bridge on the Emaj√µgi river on 23 August after bypassing German defenses held by the 45th SS Grenadier Regiment (1st Estonian). Colonel Alexander Karavchenko took command on 31 August. The division participated in the capture of Tartu, for which it was awarded the honorific \\"Tartu\\" on 7 September. Major General Grigory Sholev became the division commander on the previous day. On 10 September the 118th Corps was transferred to the 2nd Shock Army, but on 21 September the 282nd and the rest of the corps were withdrawn to the Reserve of the Supreme High Command. During the fighting in the summer, the division had suffered such heavy losses that it was down to only 1,668 personnel. Between 24 and 25 September, the division received 2,975 replacements and began their training. On 22 October the division was loaded into trains to begin its journey from Estonia to Arkhangelsk. After arriving at Arkhangelsk by 12 November, the division moved to the Lakhtinsky camp, 12 kilometers from city, and began a six-week training period for its personnel. Between 7 and 29 December, the 282nd moved by rail from Arkhangelsk to Rzesz√≥w. On 2 January 1945, the division became part of the 21st Army, still in the 118th Rifle Corps. In preparation for the Sandomierz‚ÄìSilesian Offensive of the Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive, the 282nd marched 280 kilometers to the front from 13 to 23 January. The 282nd was still understrength, even after nearly three months in the reserve, and the 826th Artillery Regiment had less batteries than normal. On 11 February, Colonel Nikolai Lysenko became the division commander. During the offensive, the division captured Hindenburg, a sub-camp of Auschwitz concentration camp. On 19 February, the 874th Rifle Regiment was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for its actions in the recapture of Hindenburg. The division subsequently fought in the Lower Silesian Offensive during February and the Upper Silesian Offensive in March. On 26 April, the 874th Regiment was awarded the Order of Bogdan Khmelnitsky, 2nd class, for its actions in the capture of Neisse, and the 872nd Regiment received the Order of Alexander Nevsky for defeating German troops southwest of Oppeln. On 6 May, the division was transferred to the 117th Rifle Corps, still part of the 21st Army, in preparation for the Prague Offensive. The 282nd launched the attack towards Schweidnitz on the next day, capturing the city and advancing into Czechoslovakia. The division captured Braunau on 9 May, and began the advance towards Prague itself, reaching Melavice, 40 kilometers from the city, a day later. At Melavice the division received orders to link up with troops of the 4th Ukrainian Front, and on 11 May it met troops of the 167th Rifle Division at Nov√Ω Byd≈æov. On the next day the 282nd transferred back to the 118th Rifle Corps, and began the march from Nehavitse to Waldenburg, where it was to be begin the demobilization process with the end of the war. The division set up a camp near the city on 14 May and remained there for the next few weeks. Personnel who were not demobilized transferred to the 103rd Guards Rifle Division. In mid-June, personnel who were to be demobilized marched to Szeged by 18 July. The division was disbanded soon after with the Central Group of Forces.

He has held positions at the University of Alabama and Harvard University, and he has served as a Visiting Professor at Stanford University, University of Washington, and Chiba University. His main area of research is Japanese elections. Reed \\"calls himself an 'election junkie,'\\" and he has gathered and published a critical data-set of Japanese elections after World War II. Reviewers of his books note his \\"well-deserved reputation for insight and clarity in his writing on Japanese elections,\\" combining \\"quality scholarship and an accessible writing style.\\" In the field of Comparative Politics, his most cited articles concern Duverger's Law, especially testing and extending this principle in light of data from Japan and Italy. In Making Votes Count, Gary W. Cox credits Reed as \\"the first to note the 'M + 1 equilibrium'... in his article extending Duverger's Law to the Japanese case.\\" He also engaged in related debates about the M + 1 equilibrium. Eric C. Browne and Dennis Patterson extended and interpreted this principle in terms of rational choice theory, while their interpretation was contested by Gary W. Cox, and Reed also argued strongly against \\"the idea of rational calculation as the mechanism that produced the observed behavior.\\" Based on his experience of teaching about Japan in the United States, Reed has also written a book, Making Common Sense of Japan, which \\"demystifies various stereotypes about Japanese culture while revealing the naivete of culture-driven arguments about Japanese political economy.\\" Read even beyond Political Science, one reviewer even noted that the book \\"rings down the curtain on what-Japan-is-like debates.\\" Recently, Reed has taken up the understudied topic of Religion and Politics in Japan, writing about secularization in relation to the Asia Barometer survey and also co-authoring a groundbreaking book on S≈çka Gakkai and K≈çmeit≈ç, K≈çmeit≈ç: Politics and Religion in Japan, which Helen Hardacre notes fills a gap since \\"research has not kept pace with the impact of S≈çka Gakkai and K≈çmeit≈ç, the political party that S≈çka Gakkai founded in 1964, though both have exerted significant influence in Japanese politics for half a century.\\" Together with co-authors George Ehrhardt, Axel Klein, and Levi McLaughlin, he here addresses \\"the party‚Äôs understudied history,\\" and the Japan Times credits the book with filling a gap whereby \\"even though Japanese postwar politics cannot be understood without studying Komeito, there are few books about the party.\\" Background Born in 1947 in Indiana, Steven R. Reed received his BA from Wabash College, majoring in political science. He served in the US Army from 1970-1973, where he learned Chinese and Japanese. He completed his PhD in 1979 from the University of Michigan. He taught at the University of Alabama and Harvard University before moving to Japan in 1993 to take up a position at Chuo University. He teaches and writes in Japanese as well as English.

He is the founder of Classical Guitar magazine. He produced several recordings for his company's label, Guitar Masters Records, from 1981 to 1985.  Career  Maurice Summerfield was born in Newcastle-upon-Tyne in the UK. He played the guitar professionally in jazz groups and dance bands in the North East of England in his late teens and early twenties. In 1957 he studied with Ivor Mairants in London and in the same year made first contact with guitarist Barney Kessel. During the next year he joined the family business, which was founded in 1900. Several years later he began importing and selling musical instruments and products made by Ibanez, Guild Guitar Company, CSL and Levin, Tama, D'Addario, C. F. Martin & Company, Savarez, and La Bella. The company emphasized guitar, fretted instruments, and accessories. Summerfield instigated the production of the first authentic reproductions (CSL 'Gypsy' range) of the original 1930s Maccaferri/Selmer guitars used by Django Reinhardt and the Joe Pass JP20 guitar for the Ibanez company. He has had a special relationship over many years with Jorge Morel, Argentinian guitarist. He produced three recordings and published 15 volumes of guitar solos and arrangements by Morel. In 1978 Summerfield established the Ashley Mark Publishing Company, a mail order business that sold guitar books and music. In 1981 he founded Guitar Masters Records, a company producing guitar recordings by David Russell, Jorge Morel, Jorge Cardoso, Maria Isabel Siewers, Neil Smith, and Krzysztof Pelech. alt=Reception at Britannia Hotel, London, October 1978 to celebrate the publication of the first edition of 'The Jazz Guitar, Its Evolution, Players and Personalities since 1900'. Summerfield developed a close relationship with Barney Kessel, resulting in his presenting the guitarist in concert and master classes, publishing three volumes of guitar solos, and writing the Kessel's authorized biography. In 1976 Summerfield and two friends founded the Guitar Appreciation Society of North East England. This society presented classical, jazz, and flamenco guitarists in concert in the Newcastle-upon-Tyne area. In September 1982 he founded Classical Guitar magazine. He sold this magazine to String Letter Media (US) in 2014. Summerfield promoted many concerts, including an annual classical guitar series at the Wigmore Hall in London. Starting in 1984, these concerts featured guitarists from different countries. From 1991 Summerfield helped organize, with the Edward James Foundation, the first twenty annual international classical guitar festivals at West Dean College in West Sussex, UK. For over 38 years Summerfield was a council member of the UK's Music Industries Association (MIA-formerly AMII and then AMI) general committee. In July 1997 he was elected to the Freedom of the Worshipful Company of Musicians (The Musicians Company) a City of London livery company. In December 1997 he received the Freedom of the City of London. In October 2003 he was elected to serve on the Court of the Musicians Company and was installed as its Master in November 2009. In May 2010 Summerfield was made an Honorary Associate of the Royal Academy of Music.

Merrick. Background =Concept= Within his development of Coral Gables, a planned city, George E. Merrick decided that he would design small communities, or villages, within Coral Gables with different international influences. The urban planning initiative was called \\"The Village Project.\\"https://www.theglampad.com/2013/09/the-historic-villages-of- coral-gables.html While the predominant architectural style in Coral Gables in Mediterranean Revival, some of the villages would become rare exceptions intended to add more architectural diversity to the new city it, such with as the Chinese and the Dutch South African Villages.https://www.coralgables.com/departments/HistoricalResourcesCulturalArts/villages The original plan, devised in collaboration with banker and former Ohio governor Myers Y. Cooper, called for 14 villages at a cost of $75 million, with financing by the American Building Corporation of Cincinnati.https://communitynewspapers.com/coral-gables-news/the-seven- villages/ =Completion= The Villages were developed during the foundational real estate boom of the 1920s, and subsequently came to a halt by the end of the decade due to a cascading series of factors in its later half that included the 1926 Miami Hurricane, the 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane, the arrival of the Mediterranean fruit fly, and the onset of the Great Depression with the Wall Street Crash of 1929. In all, fewer than 80 of Merrick's intended 1,000 planned village homes were completed before development slowed.https://www.brittexusa.com/GeorgeMerrickVillages The unrealized villages included: Japanese, Italian Country, Neopolitan Baroque, Mexican Hacienda, African Bazaar, Persian Canal, and Tangier villages.https://communitynewspapers.com/coral-gables-news/the-seven-villages/ Another, far larger-scale unrealized project was the materialization of a Spanish Village. Merrick would later refer his planned Spanish Village as his \\"unfinished symphony\\" and was unable to continue his village project before his death due to his financial losses in the Depression.https://therealdeal.com/miami/issues_articles/he-s-finishing- merrick-s-dream/ =Attempted revival= Nearly a century after its premature completion, noted Coral Gables developer Ralph Sanchez and his Ponce Circle Developers firm announced the \\"Old Spanish Village\\" development project in the mid-2000s, an intended fulfillment of Merrick's original concept for a Spanish Village. Sanchez was directly inspired by Merrick's \\"The Village Project\\" of the early 1920s, which had converted nearly 10,000 acres of the Merrick family's grapefruit plantation into the original architecturally-themed village communities.https://therealdeal.com/miami/issues_articles/he-s- finishing-merrick-s-dream/ Sanchez himself spent much of the preceding decade assembling the 7.2 acres of land that would form the core of the new project.https://therealdeal.com/miami/issues_articles/he-s-finishing-merrick- s-dream/ The proposed $500 million, 900,000-square-foot project was located in downtown Coral Gables by Ponce Circle and blocks from Miracle Mile. Though large, the mostly residential complex was scaled to retain the localized charm of the Village Project and prominently implemented several elements to support the original spirit and vision of Merrick's plans. Old Spanish Village was designed in the classic Spanish Revival (with some broader elements of Mediterranean Revival) style that is prevalent in much of Coral Gables, including cobblestone walkways, open balconies, lush garden landscaping, swimming pools, and private courtyards. The architecture team composed of a high-profile collaboration between Ignacio Permuy's (son of Jesus Permuy) Coral Gables-based TERRA Architecture firm (now Permuy Architecture) and University of Miami professor Jorge Hernandez, who was responsible for the urban planning aspects.https://www.permuyarchitecture.com/portfolio/old- spanish-village/https://therealdeal.com/miami/issues_articles/he-s-finishing- merrick-s-dream/ Sanchez and the architecture team went to signifiancant lengths to ensure the project upheld Coral Gables' historic heritage, especially with respect to the original Village Project. They centrally incorporated and renovated a 1926 Merrick-era three-story art center building located at 2901 Ponce de Leon Boulevard. The renovation, costing over $1.5 million, was intended to serve as a visible and cohesive bridge between the historic elements and the new.https://therealdeal.com/miami/issues_articles/he-s-finishing-merrick-s- dream/ Additionally, leading historian and author Arva Moore Parks was hired to join the Old Spanish Village team. In the lead-up to the initial drafting of plans for Old Spanish Village in 2005, they would search extensively through newspaper archives, public documents, and photos relating to the city and the site's history as well as Merrick's plans and achievements.https://therealdeal.com/miami/issues_articles/he-s-finishing- merrick-s-dream/ Describing how George Merrick inspired the project, Sanchez said: \\"He was an incredible visionary and did things that had never been done before,\\" and \\"He is a hero in this town and this project continues his vision.\\"https://therealdeal.com/miami/issues_articles/he-s-finishing-merrick- s-dream/ The project broke ground in November 2007 and Sanchez invested $128 million into the first phase of Old Spanish Village. This included three-story villas with rooftop terraces, private elevator access, two-car garages, and the Las Porres complex with 50 luxury units in two residential towers with private elevator access. As with the original Village Project, however, Old Spanish Village was slowed substantially by the global economy, in this case the global recession, which marred the incomplete development into the early 2010s. Sanchez' death also impacted the competition as he was the main force driving the project conceptually and financially. The project was later renamed \\"Mediterranean Village\\" and continued to be plagued with increasing issues, until it was finally bought by the Jose Cuervo Spirits-linked Agave Holdings Development firm. Agave demolished the completed portions of Sanchez' Old Spanish Village and used its consolidated foundation to develop a new, substantially expanded and modern high-end commercial project called \\"The Plaza Coral Gables\\", which would grow to encompass 2.25 million square feet. =Legacy= Describing the concept of the Village Project, Moore Parks stated: ‚ÄúGeorge [Merrick] believed that beauty was for everyone, [...] He was a visionary man who believed you didn‚Äôt have to be rich to live in a beautiful setting. He set out to bring that level of beauty to the middle class\\" and \\"[...] create a place where people felt special when they were there.‚Äù https://therealdeal.com/miami/issues_articles/he-s-finishing-merrick-s-dream/ Following the suspension of the original Village Project, their architectural styles would go on to inspire and influence the housing designs of Cincinnati from the 1930-50s with the return of Myers Cooper and the American Building Corporation of Cincinnati.https://communitynewspapers.com/coral-gables- news/the-seven-villages/ During this period, the French Normandy Village was sold to the University of Miami in 1935 and by the early 1940s would house five fraternities.https://communitynewspapers.com/coral-gables-news/the-seven- villages/ The remaining six historical villages, most of which were completed by 1927, have been designated \\"Landmark Homes\\" by the City of Coral Gables.https://www.brittexusa.com/GeorgeMerrickVillages The Village of Merrick Park, a shopping mall and park built in 2002, despite its name, is unrelated to these architecturally-themed communities.

Early career Kost completed undergraduate training in 1973, and obtained his M.Sc. in 1975, both at the Department of Chemical Engineering, D.Sc. in 1981 at the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology. He obtained his MBA in 2004 at the Ben-Gurion University School of Business Administration. He completed three years of Post-Doctoral training at the University of Washington, Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Kost credits Bob Langer from MIT as an outstanding role model.  Contribution to Biomedical Science  Dr. Kost has made significant contributions to the field of Biomedical Sciences. Coming from an engineering background, Dr Kost has offered creative and unorthodox solutions to the field of drug delivery and non-invasive diagnostics. He has pioneered new medical technologies for disease management and was one of the pioneers developing artificial pancreas, studying polymeric system sensitive to glucose, and the entrapment of bone and Langerhans cells. Dr. Kost was the first to propose the ultrasonically modulated systems in which the release of drugs, from polymers or through synthetic or biological membranes, can be repeatedly modulated at will from a position external to the delivery system. His research impacts treatment of various diseases, including pain, diabetes, cardio-vascular diseases, and infectious diseases. Dr Kost contributions are particularly noteworthy in the field of transdermal drug delivery. Transdermal drug delivery (through the skin) offers an attractive alternative to needles for systemic drug administration. However, the low permeability of the skin limits its applicability. Kost has come up with creative ways to open the skin for drug delivery without compromising safety. The approach is painless, non-intrusive, and a patient-friendly method for drug delivery. In 2004 the FDA approved Kost's and coworker's application for ultrasound based system for fast acting topical anesthetic. At that year Popular Science awarded the ultrasound system GRAND AWARD for ‚ÄúBest of What‚Äôs New‚Äù. Based on the comprehensive studies of the ultrasound effect on mass transport, Kost proposed the use of the enhanced skin transport in the opposite direction to delivery, for the non-invasive continuous detection of blood analytes. The major focus has been the development of a non-invasive continuous detection of glucose. The first clinical study on diabetic volunteers was published by Kost et al. in Nature Medicine 2000. Since, Kost also proposed a novel approach for a glucose flux continuous biosensor and noninvasive detection of amniotic fluid for prenatal testing. Additional applications studied by Kost are the use of ultrasound for on-demand targeted delivery of drugs from liposomes, combined ultrasonic and enzymatic debridement of necrotic eschars and the use of ultrasound for more efficient cancer gene therapy. Nowadays, he study gene therapy approach for the treatment of psoriasis. The focus in these studies is on the effect of ultrasound on transport through tissues of no viral carriers developed by Kost complexed with miRNA. In addition to his studies on responsive controlled release systems: pH sensitive, glucose sensitive and calcium sensitive drug delivery Kost also developed a novel injectable delivery system to provide the body with a steady supply of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor. The system is based on the principle that a water insoluble polymer, dissolved in a biocompatible solvent, will participate upon contact with physiological fluids. In 2012 a collaborative project entitled ‚ÄúBio-inspired Nano-carriers for Sub-Cellular Targeted Therapeutics‚Äù of eleven research groups from Ben- Gurion University, Weizmann Institute of Science and The Hebrew University, led by Prof. Kost was approved in the framework of the National 5-year Nano- Science and Technology Program. The goal has been to study the intracellular transport phenomena in attempt to develop approaches for intracellular targeting of drugs for the treatment of cancer, diabetes, autophagy and obesity.  Academic and related positions  Prof. Joseph Kost At the Ben- Gurion University of the Negev, Kost was the Head of the Center for Biomedical Engineering 1988-1993, and Head of the Program for Biotechnology Engineering from 1993 to 1995.

The house no longer exists, and the only indication of its existence is an eponymous court development where the subdivided property is now occupied by houses and townhouses. Soldiers Hill, which was named after the Colonial Forces of Australia stationed there prior to the Eureka Rebellion in 1854, was one of the first planned suburbs of Ballarat and was considered one of Ballarat's premier addresses. Soldiers Hill \\"...has a substantially intact Victorian era architectural character, with many of its buildings featuring an abundance of period detail including distinctive decorative cast iron ornament.\\"Soldiers Hill, Victoria The Grange was weatherboard, built on brick piers standing on large bluestone foundations. It featured decorative scalloped woodwork along the eaves; decorative lattice on the entrance porch; extensive lattice work on the verandah, which stretched across the northern and western sides of the house; and a slate roof. The house had five bedrooms, a \\"middle room\\" which had a variety of uses, and a \\"breakfast room\\" which was the dining room and the place the family gathered. The formal lounge room was used as a \\"receiving room‚Äô rather than somewhere that had general family use. Separate to the house was a stand-alone building known as the \\"groom‚Äôs room\\". There was no indication of stables or other facilities for horses when the Darling family moved there in 1908.Mary & Peter Morcom, grandchildren of owner, Alfred Thomas Darling Entrance porch of The Grange  History  = John Taylor = The original purchaser from the Crown of the land that The Grange was to stand on was made in August, 1862 by J. Taylor who bought two adjoining allotments Township Plan, Township of Ballarat North, Allotments 11 & 12, Section 1, Parish of Ballarat, County of Grenville which combined to an area of 1 acre 3 roods and 8 perches, with a 265 feet west facing frontage on Lydiard Street North, Soldiers Hill. These allotments, 11 & 12, had a depth of 265 feet from Lydiard Street. This was part of significant sales of Crown land in Soldiers Hill, and the land for what were to be a number of gracious heritage homes, such as Eyres House, Trelawny, Linlithgow, and many more, was purchased during these early 1860s sales. As J. Taylor or John Taylor seems to have been quite a common name in Ballarat during this period, it is difficult to specifically identify him. Mrs. John Taylor had a daughter in October 1863, at Lydiard Street North, Soldiers Hill, but it has not been possible to clarify her relatives.The Star (Ballarat) Mon 5 October 1863 Page 2 Family Notices Other purchasers of land during the Crown Land Sales at Soldiers Hill during this time were generally quite eminent Ballarat citizens, so it seems reasonable to assume that \\"J.Taylor\\" was also. To be able to pay ¬£90 for the purchase of land was a significant amount at this time. In July 1863, a year after purchasing the land, John Taylor, butcher, raised a substantial mortgage of ¬£1,200, using the land as part surety.Transfer of Land Act 1862 Application No.52618 A month later, he paid Walter Elliott ¬£13 for a 15‚Äô wide driveway to provide direct access for his property to Gregory Street,August 1963 Part Allotment 2 Sec Ballarat.

Biography  Zeeger Gulden was born in Zaltbommel to the local municipal architect Antonie Marinus Adolf Gulden. After graduating from the Hogere Burgerschool in Zaltbommel, Zeeger Gulden moved to Amsterdam in 1896, where he was employed as an illustrator at the municipal telephone company. While he was employed at the municipal telephone company, Zeeger Gulden helped found the Amsterdam Union of Municipal Officials in 1907, and became editor of the union's magazine Het Prinsenhof. After he published an article in the magazine that was critical of the municipal government, Zeeger Gulden was fired from the municipal telephone company in 1908. This affair was widely reported on in the media and eventually led to the resignation of Amsterdam mayor Wilhelmus Frederik van Leeuwen. Zeeger Gulden subsequently established himself as an architect, and founded the architect firm Gulden & Geldmaker together with his colleague Melle Geldmaker, which was responsible for many social housing projects in Amsterdam and in other towns in the Netherlands. In 1909, Zeeger Gulden was elected to the municipal council of Amsterdam for the Social Democratic Workers' Party. In the 1920s, Zeeger Gulden together with Emanuel Boekman pleaded for the construction of an underground railway network in Amsterdam. Zeeger Gulden would serve for 30 years as a municipal councillor to eventually resign on 5 September 1939. After the Second World War, Zeeger Gulden worked together with architect Iza√§k Blomhert (1879-1956) and after Blomhert's death with Ger Husslage.

I don't think anything I say is going to affect whether people are going to listen. I just do my thing and hope for the best.\\" Her solo album, What's a Heartache For?, appeared in 1994.

His final posting was as United States Ambassador to East Germany.  Early life  Meehan was born in the United States city of East Orange, New Jersey to British parents, who were staying in the United States for a short period. He would move to Scotland when his homesick mother returned home, growing up in the Scottish shipbuilding town of Clydebank, situated eight miles west along the River Clyde from Glasgow. Clydebank, as a centre of shipbuilding during World War II was a major target for the Luftwaffe and a teenage Meehan would help with the clear up after bombing raids. He graduated in 1945 from the University of Glasgow with a Master of Arts degree in History. He was, by this time, a fluent German speaker. His birth in the United States rendered him an American citizen, and as such he was drafted in 1945 for military service, with his postings being to Fontainebleau for training, then onto Allied-occupied Germany. His education and fluent German made him consider a career with the United States Department of State. Meehan completed his two years of military service in 1947, and took a position as a clerk at the Consular Agency of the United States, Bremen, serving from 1947 to 1948. His next posting was as an administrative assistant at the Economic Cooperation Administration in Washington, D.C., serving from 1948 to 1951, at which point he formally joined the United States Foreign Service.  Diplomatic career  Meehan's first posting with the Foreign Service was to the United States High Commission for Germany from 1951 to 1952, where he served as an information officer. He then moved to the Consulate General of the United States, Hamburg, serving from 1952 to 1953. He moved to Paris and was attached to the NATO mission as a political officer, serving from 1953 to 1956. He returned to the United States and attended Harvard University, where he studied for a Masters in Public Administration, graduating in 1957. He also undertook Russian language classes whilst in the United States. He would be appointed an intelligence specialist within the Department of State in 1957, and was posted to Moscow in 1959, serving for two years to 1961. Meehan's posting to Moscow coincided with the Francis Gary Powers U-2 incident. He was despatched by the United States Ambassador to Russia to view the wreckage when the Soviet authorities placed it on display. He was next assigned to Berlin as their political officer, and in this role, he was present in 1962 for the exchange of prisoners between the United States of America and the Soviet Union. The exchange of prisoners saw the U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers exchanged for the Soviet spy Rudolf Abel on Glienicke Bridge. The exchange included the release of Frederic Pryor at Checkpoint Charlie, and Meehan was assigned to collect Pryor, working with the Stasi lawyer Wolfgang Vogel to handle the prisoner collection. The two men would become lifelong friends as a result of Vogel's prisoner exchange work. Meehan spent time working at the Department of State in the United States from 1966 to 1968, initially as watch officer and then as the director of the Department of State's Operations Centre. He held the title Deputy Executive Secretary of the Department of State from 1967 to 1968. His postings continued to increase in seniority, he was appointed Deputy Chief of Mission in Budapest from 1968 to 1972, moving to become the counsellor for political affairs in Bonn from 1972 to 1975. He was Deputy Chief of Mission in Vienna from 1975 to 1977 and then in Bonn from 1977 to 1979. Meehan and his wife became good friends with J√≥zsef Mindszenty during their posting to Hungary. His first Ambassador level posting was in 1979, when he was appointed as the United States Ambassador to Czechoslovakia in a short posting which lasted from 23 March 1979 to 20 October 1980. He was then appointed United States Ambassador to Poland, serving from 2 October 1980 to 11 February 1983. His posting to Poland was particularly eventful; he was visiting Washington, D.C. on business when Wojciech Jaruzelski imposed martial law in Poland, his return to Poland required the United States Embassy to smuggle Meehan across the now sealed border hidden in the back of a van. Meehan shaking hands with East Germany's leader Erich Honecker in 1987. Meehan then took a research position at Georgetown University, and was also a senior foreign policy officer in the Office for Management Operations at the Department of State from October 1984 to April 1985. His final posting was as United States Ambassador to East Germany, serving from 16 September 1985 to 30 November 1988. He was present when United States President Ronald Reagan made the famous Tear down this wall! speech. He returned to his research position at Georgetown University at the conclusion of his East Berlin posting. He was fluent in German, Russian, French, Polish, Czech and Hungarian by the conclusion of his diplomatic career. He was (and remains) deeply interested in Russia and Moscow, consequently he had hoped for the 'prize' of the United States Ambassador to Russia posting, but it was to elude him at the end of his career.  Retirement  Meehan retired from the United States Foreign Service at the end of his appointment in 1988. He and his wife moved to Helensburgh in what was their 23rd home since their marriage. Meehan would write some briefing notes and material about the Eastern Bloc, more recently, there has been media interest about such a high-profile American diplomat living quietly in Helensburgh. BBC Scotland produced a 30-minute documentary about Meehan's career and some of his thoughts on the current political climate in both Washington DC and Moscow; this program aired on 3 April 2017.  Personal life  Meehan married Margaret (n√©e Kearns) in Manhattan, New York in 1949, though the couple had initially met in Clydebank, where Margaret and her family lived. The Kearns family were evacuated to Helensburgh when Clydebank was subject to the heaviest aerial bombardments during World War II. Meehan and his family would be evacuated to Dumbarton, but Frank and Margaret had the same group of friends and shared interests, which included hillwalking, and they stayed in contact. Margaret travelled to the United States to marry her fianc√©e, but worked, initially, as a child minder. She easily took to her role as a hostess and her skills in organising and hosting functions were well known within the Foreign Service. Meehan and his wife had four children; Anne, Catherine, Frances and Jim. Margaret died on 15 March 2015, aged 92, after a lengthy illness, during which she was cared for by her husband and family. Margaret was sufficiently well known for The Scotsman to publish an obituary shortly after her death. Meehan was awarded an honorary degree (Doctor of Laws) from the University of Glasgow in 1986.

Club career In preparation of the 2014-15 Torneo Argentino B, Kimberley de Mar del Plata announced that they would sign Sendra; he left them some months later. Club Atl√©tico Alvarado signed 5 players, including Sendra, in February 2015 in a bid to bolster their squad. Sendra was handed a trial with S.League side, Geylang International FC and played in a pre-season friendly against the Singapore U-22. After signing for Geylang, he featured for them in friendlies in Malaysia and Thailand. He had a slow start to the season, making only one appearance in the Eagles' first four games due to a small injury. However, in Geylang's 5th game of the season, Sendra was handed his first start of the season. He finally completed his first competitive 90 minutes for the Eagles and injected much needed creativity in the final third in a 2-0 win over the Garena Young Lions. Sendra did not continue with Geylang and decided to accept a lucrative offer from Indonesian 1st tier team Perseru Serui. He only completed two months with the team and left after economic conditions were not satisfied by Perseru. As a consequence Ricardo could not sign for any other team in Indonesia and had to settle training with other players without a team for a few months until he accepted an offer to play again in Spain 3rd division team Inter Ibiza CD. Sendra moved to the Philippines to play in the Philippines Football League, first joining Mendiola before moving to Stallion Laguna in 2020.

Van Breukelen published the puzzle in 1997 in the Netherlands chess magazine Schakend Nederland. It was presented by English grandmaster James Plaskett, at a top-flight chess tournament in Brussels in 1987, hence the name \\"Plaskett's Puzzle\\". According to contemporary accounts, of the several strong grandmasters who analyzed the position, only former World Champion Mikhail Tal was able to solve it. While the solution is striking, the study was found to be flawed in that White has no immediately decisive continuation if Black plays 4...Kg4 rather than the obvious 4...Nf7+. This issue may be alleviated by placing the black knight on h8 or e5 rather than g5, but the flawed version of the study demonstrated by Plaskett and published by van Breukelen remains the best known. Solution 1.Nf6+ Kg7 :If 1...Kg6 2.Bh5+ followed by 3.d8=Q, as the bishop now covers the forking square f7. 2.Nh5+ Kg6 :If 2...Kf7 3.d8=Q wins; if 2...Kh7 3.Bc2+ forces the king on to the back rank, allowing d8=Q+ and mate in a few moves. 3.Bc2+!! :This move is difficult for engines to find. 3...Kxh5 4.d8=Q! Nf7+ :The obvious move, and the intent of the composer, however 4...Kg4 puts up much stiffer resistance. (5.Qf6 wins according to Ehn and Kastner, but the win is not intuitively clear). If the problem is set with the knight on h8, then 4...Kg4 can be met by 5.Qh4+ with mate soon to follow. 5.Ke6 Nxd8+ 6.Kf5 :White threatens Bd1+. There now follows a remarkable zig zag manoeuvre by the bishop, Black defending against the mating threats by twice to a knight to cover the mating square, until there is no further defence. 6...e2 7.Be4 e1=N 8.Bd5 c2 9.Bc4 c1=N 10.Bb5 Nc7 :Black can delay the inevitable mate by one move by 10...Nc6. 11.Ba4 1-0 Mate in 3 by Bd1 cannot be prevented, for example 11...Ne2 12.Bd1 Nf3 13.Bxe2 and 14.Bxf3# or 11...Nb3 12.Bxb3 Nc2 13.Bxc2 and 14.Bd1#.

It currently is headquartered in the Yizhuang District, Beijing, China. In June 2017, Evoke Motorcycles were chosen as one of the 5 most exciting products at CES Asia's Startup Park.  Model History  The Urban S is an Italian inspired naked street bike (see types of motorcycles) that has a 100% electric drivetrain and a 200 km (125 mile) range. It is the first mass-produced Evoke bike available and was released in China in summer 2015 and is available in selected European countries in early 2018. When released, it will be the lowest cost, entry level electric motorcycle on the market with a $9499 MSRP. The Urban S is aimed at the new rider demographic but is also suitable for riders looking for a low maintenance environmentally friendly method of commuting. A cafe racer style bike, the Urban Classic, was release at the EICMA Milan motorcycle expo 2017 and is now in production. Orange Evoke Urban S An earlier electric bike was commissioned by the Indonesian police force in 2012 and 5 prototypes were produced.

There are currently distributors for China, France, Austria, Hungary. and the United Kingdom so consumers will be able to buy an Evoke Electric Motorcycle in these countries in the coming months. More countries are expected to have bikes available from early 2018.  MyEvoke  MyEvoke is a new concept of riding a motorcycle without buying one. The user pays an initial deposit for an Urban S then a monthly subscription. When the rider is running low on battery charge, they ride the bike to a swap station and swap the bike for a fresh one. This removes the hassle of charging, maintaining and insuring a motorcycle. The MyEvoke service will initially be released in Beijing then expand to other cities across China and Europe. MyEvoke was in Beta testing phase in Beijing and has been currently discontinued at this time.

Prior to 1970 the school district had autonomous community schools and racial segregation; at that time all schools were integrated and the district was unified, with centrally located schools. After 1970 the white student population declined, with some students going to the Robert F. Munroe Day School and the Tallavanna Christian School.White, p. 84 (PDF p. 92). According to Headley J. White, author of the 2006 PhD thesis \\"Effects of Desegregation on Gadsden County, Florida Public Schools 1968-1972,\\" in post-desegregation Gadsden County, white students attending most Gadsden County public schools experienced stigma.White, p. 74 (PDF p. 82) Many black students no longer worked on tobacco fields, causing the tobacco industry in the county to suffer and therefore damaging its economy and causing Gadsden County's population to decline. By 1999 the majority of white students were in private schools. In 1999 a Florida Trend article written by Cynthia Barnett described the county public schools as representing \\"everything wrong with the state's public schools: High rates of illiteracy, delinquency, drop-outs and teen pregnancy.\\" Circa 2002 the school district had almost 10,000 students.

It has been identified by Funk and McCombs (2015) as the ‚Äúconceptual inverse‚Äù of agenda-setting, focusing on demographic characteristics of communities shaping news instead of news as a driver of public perception. For example, community structure theory has found repeated links between indicators of vulnerability (such as unemployment levels, poverty levels, crime rate, etc.) and favorable coverage of critical US national issues such as immigration reform or universal health care. Further, in cross-national studies comparing national characteristics and reporting on human trafficking, HIV/AIDS treatment access, water handling/contamination, and child labor, media coverage varied significantly with levels of \\"female empowerment\\"‚Äî female literacy rate, female child life expectancy, and female school life expectancy.  Early influences  The modern community structure model originated with the work of University of Chicago‚Äôs Robert Park, who in The Immigrant Press and Its Control first suggested society could influence media. Morris Janowitz later introduced the concept that press coverage could serve as an index of the social structure and values of distinct communities. Janowitz employed multiple methodologies for his research, including reader surveys, in-depth interviews with journalists, and content analysis of 82 different community newspapers in the Chicago area. Tichenor, Donohue and Olien evolved Park‚Äôs and Janowitz‚Äôs work with their concept of structural pluralism, finding differences between newspaper reporting in smaller, relatively homogenous metropolitan areas and that in larger, more demographically diverse areas, the latter manifesting more progressive coverage. These University of Minnesota theorists later developed the ‚Äúguard dog‚Äù hypothesis, emphasizing the ‚Äúsocial control‚Äù role of media, whereby local media function less as watchdogs and more as guard dogs protecting the interests of powerful, elite members of society. Other scholars in the late 90s (Hindman, 1999; Demers & Viswanath, 1999; McLeod and Hertog, 1999) also recognized a connection between mass media coverage and community characteristics, but emphasized the role of media less as mechanisms for social control than for social change. When Hindman compared media coverage in large vs. small ethic populations, he found a difference in how similar stories were covered based on the relative size of ethnic groups in communities. Similarly, McLeod and Hertog (1999) found news media covered protest mobilizations more favorably in communities with a greater numbers of protesters. Demers and Viswanath (1999) enhanced previous structural findings by exploring the role of media as agents of both social control and social change. With the introduction of digital tools for analyzing media texts, the community structure model or approach was successfully expanded, tested, and used to study systematic news reports of critical events in communities across the nation and throughout the world by John C. Pollock, who began identifying this work as ‚ÄúCommunity Structure‚Äù research.Pollock, J. C. (2013a). Community structure research. In P. Moy (Ed.), Oxford Bibliographies Online. New York, NY: Oxford University Press.  Contemporary applications  Pollock and coauthors made three key contributions to community structure theory. First, they conducted among the first US nationwide and cross-national studies using the community structure model, comparing multiple large metropolitan areas and countries, expanding study sample sizes beyond a focus on one or two cities. Second, Pollock et al. also evolved the theory to include a Media Vector methodological tool for measuring both content direction and editorial prominence of articles, then combining them into a single score, thereby adding a way to consider editorial evaluation as well as article content. Third, Pollock and coauthor findings often challenged the traditional ‚Äúguard dog‚Äù hypothesis by concluding that media can often reflect the interests of more vulnerable stakeholders. Community structure studies are related to work focusing on the roles of social capital (in political science and sociology literatures) and social determinants of health (in health communication and public health literatures) and social ecological models (in sociology and public health). In 2008, Pollock authored the entry on the \\"Community Structure model\\" for the International Encyclopedia of Communication, and in 2013, he authored an authoritative annotated bibliography on Community Structure scholarship for Oxford Bibliographies Online.

It is a method of controlled and intermittent irrigation. A periodic drying and re- flooding irrigation scheduling approach is followed in which the fields are allowed to dry for few days before re-irrigation, without stressing the plants. This method reduces water demand for irrigation and greenhouse gas emissions without reducing crop yields.  History  Drying and flooding practices have been used for several decades as a water-saving measure, but in many cases, farmers were practicing an uncontrolled or unplanned drying and re-flooding method. Farmers were practicing ‚Äòforced‚Äô AWD as early as 2006 in the AMRIS region.AMRIS-JICA, 2007. Project Completion Report: Irrigators‚Äô Association Strengthening Support in Angat Maasim River Irrigation System. Technical Cooperation Project. Some water management practices and especially keeping non-flooded conditions in the rice field for short intervals are common for about 40% of rice farmers in China and more than 80% rice farmers in North-Western India and in Japan.Richards, M., Sander, B.O., 2014. Alternate wetting and drying in irrigated rice. Implementation guidance for policymakers and investors. https://cgspace.cgiar.org/rest/bitstreams/34363/retrieve However, nowadays farmers follow a ‚Äòsafe‚Äô AWD in which they maintain the 15-cm subsurface water level threshold for re-flooding.Lampayan, R.M., Palis, F.G., Flor, R.B., Bouman, B.A., Quicho, E., De Dios, J., Espiritu, A., Sibayan, E., Vicmudo, V., Lactaoen, A., 2009. Adoption and dissemination of ‚Äúsafe alternate wetting and drying‚Äù in pump irrigated rice areas in the Philippines, 60th International Executive Council Meeting of the International Commission on Irrigation and Drainage (ICID), 5th Regional Conference. This method has become a recommended practice in water-scarce irrigated rice areas in South and Southeast Asia. In the Philippines, the adoption of safe AWD started in Tarlac Province in 2002 with farmers using deep-well pump systems. The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) has been promoting alternate wetting and drying as a smart water-saving technology for rice cultivation through national agricultural research and extension in Bangladesh, the Philippines, and Vietnam.  Implementation and operation  AWD is suitable for lowland rice growing areas where soils can be drained in 5-day intervals. The field will be unable to dry during rice season if rainfall exceeds evapotranspiration and seepage. Therefore, AWD is suitable for dry season rice cultivation. = Implementation method = Illustration of alternate wetting and drying method A water tube/pipe made of PVC is usually used to practice AWD method. The main purpose of the tube is to monitor the water depth. The tube allows measuring water availability in the field below the soil surface. The usual practice is to use a pipe of 7‚Äì10 cm diameter and 30 cm long, with perforations in bottom 20 cm. The pipe is installed in such a way that the bottom 20 cm of perforated portion remains below the soil surface and the non-perforated 10 cm above the surface. The perforations permit the water to come inside the tube from the soil, where a scale is used to measure water depth below the soil surface. However, there are variations in preparing the tube/pipe for the implementation of AWD. Some farmers use a bamboo pipe instead of PVC pipe. Some farmers use a 30 cm tube with 15 cm perforated at the bottom. = Operation technique = Illustration of AWD operation technique After the irrigation in the crop field, the water depth gradually decreases because of evapotranspiration, seepage, and percolation. Because of the installed tubes in the field, it is possible to monitor the water depth below the soil surface up to 15‚Äì20 cm. When the water level drops 15 cm below the soil surface, irrigation should be applied in the field to re-flood to a depth of 5 cm. During the flowering stage of the rice, the field should be kept flooded. After flowering, during the mid-season and late season (grain filling and ripening stages), the water level is allowed to drop below the soil surface to 15 cm before re-irrigation. To suppress the growth of weeds in the rice field, AWD method should be followed 1‚Äì2 weeks after the transplantation. In the case of many weeds in the field, AWD needs to be started after three weeks of transplantation. Usually, the fertilizer recommendations are as same as continuous flooding method. Application of nitrogen fertilizer is preferable on dry soil just before re-irrigation. To ensure a similar dry or wet condition throughout the crop field, which is essential to maintain good yield, it is important to level the rice field properly.  Advantages and disadvantages  = Advantages = AWD method can save water by about 38% without adversely affecting rice yields.Rejesus, R.M., Palis, F.G., Rodriguez, D.G.P., Lampayan, R.M., Bouman, B.A., 2011. Impact of the alternate wetting and drying (AWD) water-saving irrigation technique: evidence from rice producers in the Philippines. Food Policy 36, 280-288. This method increases water productivity by 16.9% compared with continuously flood irrigation.Tan, X., Shao, D., Liu, H., Yang, F., Xiao, C., Yang, H., 2013. Effects of alternate wetting and drying irrigation on percolation and nitrogen leaching in paddy fields. Paddy and Water Environment 11, 381-395. High-yielding rice varieties developed for continuously flood irrigation rice system still produce high yield under safe AWD.Yao, F., Huang, J., Cui, K., Nie, L., Xiang, J., Liu, X., Wu, W., Chen, M., Peng, S., 2012. Agronomic performance of high- yielding rice variety grown under alternate wetting and drying irrigation. Field Crops Research 126, 16-22. This method can even increase grain yield because of enhancement in grain-filling rate, root growth and remobilization of carbon reserves from vegetative tissues to grains.Tuong, T., Bouman, B., Mortimer, M., 2005.

Adoption and economics of alternate wetting and drying water management for irrigated lowland rice. Field Crops Research 170, 95-108. This method can also reduce the labor costs by improving field conditions at harvest, allowing mechanical harvest. AWD leads to firmer soil conditions at harvest, which is suitable to operate machines in the field. Therefore, AWD increases net return for farmers. Several studies also indicate that AWD reduces methane (CH4) emissions.Lagomarsino, A., Agnelli, A.E., Linquist, B., Adviento-Borbe, M.A., Agnelli, A., Gavina, G., Ravaglia, S., Ferrara, R.M., 2016.

Mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions and reduced irrigation water use in rice production through water-saving irrigation scheduling, reduced tillage and fertiliser application strategies. Science of the Total Environment, p.140215. CH4 is produced by the anaerobic decomposition of the organic material in the wet/flooded paddy field. Allowing to drop water level below soil surface removes the anaerobic condition for some time till re-flooded and pauses the production of CH4 from the rice field for several times and, hence, reduce the total amount of CH4 released during the rice growing season. This method has been assumed to reduce CH4 emissions by an average of 48% compared to continuous flooding in the 2006 IPCC methodology. Alternate wetting and moderate soil drying reduce cadmium accumulation in rice grains. AWD can dramatically reduce the concentration of arsenic in harvested rice grains.Price, A.H., Norton, G.J., Salt, D.E., Ebenhoeh, O., Meharg, A.A., Meharg, C., Islam, M.R., Sarma, R.N., Dasgupta, T., Ismail, A.M., 2013.

Periodic soil drying may reduce the incidence of fungal diseases. = Disadvantages = The major disadvantage of AWD method is the increased N2O emissions. Also, rice productivity can reduce by following AWD for non-trained farmers. High weed growth rate in the crop field is a major problem from the farmers' point of view.

This includes the NATO Command Structure as well as the NATO Force Structure. The purpose of FMN is ultimately to support Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) and decision-making in operations by enabling a rapid instantiation of mission networks. Including the NATO Command Structure, 35 nations have joined the FMN initiative as so called \\"FMN Affiliates\\" and work together under the FMN Framework Process to coordinate the design, development and delivery of operational and technical capabilities required to conduct net-centric operations. Each development increment is referred to as an \\"FMN Spiral\\". The respective requirements, architecture, standards, procedural and technical instructions are documented in so called \\"FMN Spiral Specifications\\". FMN Spiral Specifications are based on well known standards and best practices, hence supported by most off-the-shelf products and vendor neutral. TACOMS standards and profiles specify a common, technology and topology independent network interoperability layer (or federated core) for federated mission networks. There is also a rolling 10-year FMN Spiral Specification Roadmap of the envisioned future capabilities. At the same time, the Coalition Interoperability Assurance and Validation (CIAV) process ensures that current interoperability issues are being identified and fed back into FMN capability development. Background NATO Federated Mission Networking arose from the operational requirement in Afghanistan which necessitated troop contributing nations to operate in a single information sharing domain called the Afghanistan Mission Network (AMN).. Also available in print form. Through the experience of ISAF in Afghanistan, the value of a coalition-wide network was made clear: greater situational awareness facilitates more effective decision making. Based on improved coalition unity of effort and speed of command, Commander ISAF endorsed AMN best practices as the \\"right model\\" for future coalition missions and forwarded the requirement to NATO and to the US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. On 21 November 2012, the NATO Military Committee agreed the \\"Future Mission Network Concept\\", later noted by the North Atlantic Council (NAC), as the basis for the development of an implementation plan that defines \\"the implications for NATO and the Nations\\". The Concept provided overarching guidance for establishing a federated mission networking capability that enables effective information sharing among NATO, NATO member nation and/or non-NATO entities participating in operations. The FMN Concept describes the operational requirements, principles, and implementation considerations for a capability consisting of three components: Governance, FMN Framework, and Mission Networks. The FMN Concept envisions a world in which the commander of an operation effectively performs end-to-end processes and shares information in a coalition environment. This ability is enabled through a common understanding of how those processes are described and through the access to shared, secure information. The commander must be able to communicate intent and direction down to the tactical level and provide reports and recommendations up to the strategic level. Information must be available throughout the coalition force in any foreseeable operational scenario. Achievement of trust and transparency among mission participants is essential. The FMN Concept reflects a clear lesson learned: Operational experience has irrefutably demonstrated that a federated mission network is the best means to create this common, mission-wide data and information sharing environment. The FMN Concept concludes that the ability to generate federated mission network instances is therefore a key, essential capability for NATO, NATO member nations and/or non-NATO entities participating in operations. In contrast to the AMN, Federated Mission Networking attempts for Mission Networks to be: * simpler, by reducing the number of joining options * more robust, by removing the need for a centralized core and introducing redundant peering (TACOMS) * faster to set- up, by providing off-the-shelf template solutions * easier to manage, by using common and interoperable IT Service Management practices * more flexible, by not having to depend on a single core * able to share information with other entities, by introducing data labeling * more cost effective, by enabling the cross provisioning of services between mission network participants In the context of FMN, a federation is an association where each stakeholder retains control of their own capabilities and affairs while accepting and complying with the requirements laid out in pre-negotiated and agreed arrangements in a collective fashion. To facilitate collaboration and coordination among \\"FMN Affiliates\\", NATO has agreed to host an FMN Secretariat which is composed of liaison officers from each \\"FMN Affiliate\\". The FMN Secretariat coordinates the activities of five working groups which address operational and security requirements, capability planning and specification development, assurance and validation of interoperability, and coordination of change implementation. The working groups forward their products to a flag and general officer level FMN Management Group for review and delivery to respective national or organizational governance bodies for consideration, acceptance and implementation. Command implications The operational commander's requirements are the pre-eminent driver of each Mission Network. The FMN Concept identified six objectives that drive the operational requirements for nearly all mission networks: # Seamless human-to-human communication across the force. # A single view of the battle space across the Mission Network. # Timely provision of a Mission Network. # Provision of consistent, secure, accurate and reliable mission data. # Community of Interest (COI) capabilities that align with the mission requirement. # Well-trained staff that can support an effective decision cycle and take full advantage of the systems provided. A Mission Network must support the respective chain of command and the execution of relevant mission threads and it must respond to the Commander's battle rhythm during each phase of the operation. FMN defines four different types of environments: * collective training environment (CTE) for preparing forces ahead of a mission * verification and validation environment (VVE) for testing any changes to procedures, applications and services * operations planning environment (OPE) for supporting collaborative planning of coalition participants that is conducted prior to deployment * mission execution environment (MEE) covers the actual deployment and instantiation of a federated mission network to support a specific operation. The NATO FMN Implementation Plan identified the need for establishing a mission thread approach to provide consistent context for interoperability, training, planning and mission activities to enhance the effectiveness of future operations and inform FMN implementation. As a result, the NATO Strategic Commands produced a NATO Mission Thread Capstone Concept. The implementation of this concept will impact the development of the Doctrine, Organization, Training and Standards, and requires contributions and participation of the operational community. Industry implications In support of the FMN initiative, the Network Centric Operations Industry Consortium has introduced a new Interoperability Verification (IV) process, intended to support the acquisition of technical products and services for Federated Mission Networking. The IV assessment, based on product testing that takes place as part of the normal quality manufacturing process, looks at how well the technology meets FMN Spiral Specifications and can be implemented. The vision is for NATO and its partners to get enhanced capability for the same cost and for vendors to have access to more markets. National implementation Following the idea of a federation, each FMN affiliate is responsible for implementing own capabilities that conform with FMN Spiral Specifications. border Based on the lessons learned from operations in many coalitions, Belgium decided to formally affiliate to FMN early in March 2016. The implementation of this international initiative is drawn up by using a pragmatic and holistic approach following the DOTMLPFI methodology. At this stage (Spiral 2 as of June 2019), Belgium disposes of a capability enabler (Mission Defence Network) which offers minimum services to allow deployed troops to communicate, share and exchange information with partners, in a secure way, and automatically. Those services will be expanding with the following spiral development. border Canada's C4ISR Vision outlines the importance of interoperability with its Joint, Interagency, Multinational, Public (JIMP) partners and sets strategic objectives to achieve it within both the enduring and episodic domains of its Military Integrated Information Infrastructure (MI3). Recognizing that FMN concepts and standards are key to achieving its goals, Canada is implementing the FMN Spiral specifications as part of its 'Canadian Deployable Mission Network' (CDMN) design. True operational interoperability takes more than just technology so Canada champions the use of FMN capable forces in all appropriate multilateral operations, exercises and events that it participates in as a way to ingrain interoperability as a fundamental aspect of modern operations. border The initiative 'German Mission Network' aims to create improved command and control capabilities for the German armed forces. The German Mission Network is fully compatible with NATO's Federated Mission Networking and merges the previously physically separated IT systems and services, for deployments to a physically and logically interoperable and integrated multinational system-of- systems. The 'Harmonization of Command and Control Information Systems' program (Harmonisierung der F√ºhrungsinformationssysteme - HaFIS) is the first to spearhead this challenge with a planned successive enlargement to other projects over the following years. border In 2015, after the formal affiliation to the FMN initiative, Italy approved the Governance and Management structure of the Italian FMN initiative aiming at achieving the capability to set up and manage a Mission Network according to the FMN Specifications. In 2016 Italy confirmed the compliance of the Italian FMN Node to FMN Spiral 1 requirements in a number of multinational exercises and has actively contributed to the development for the next set of capabilities. In the light of the results achieved in 2016, Italy decided to implement the capability acquired in Afghanistan by deploying an FMN Node federated to the Afghanistan Mission Network (AMN) which is now fully operational. The Italian Defence is also in the process of approving the implementation of an Italian Mission Network to fulfil the needs in terms of Command and Control of a mission or multinational operations (also in the role of \\"leading nation\\" of a coalition) or, in a dual use perspective, in case of an emergency operation for humanitarian aid and disaster relief. Italy is also fully engaged in the FMN management with Subject Matter Experts and representatives in the FMN Secretariat, contributing to the evolution of the NATO FMN initiative. border The Netherlands implemented the first set of agreed FMN capabilities (Spiral 1) within their deployable Theatre Independent Tactical Adaptive Armed Forces Network (TITAAN) which is used by the Dutch armed forces. The next steps include further alignment with FMN capabilities and the implementation of future FMN Spiral Specifications within TITAAN. The Netherlands acknowledged that the implementation of federated capabilities needs a DOTMLPF-I perspective to be able to reach the next level of interoperability. The German and Dutch armed forces are taking their cooperation to an unprecedented level of integration. It entails the harmonization of requirements, procedures, education and training. Federating capabilities provided by both nations in the context of the multinational 1 (GE/NL) Corps is a demonstration of the practical implementation of FMN and helps nations to gain experience and to enhance flexibility and interoperability. border In recognizing that FMN is more than just creating interoperable C2 systems, like the Netherlands, Norway is seeking to adopt the entire concept of Federation and Networking from a DOTMLPF-I perspective. In practical terms this involves other agencies than those traditionally involved with development and implementation of C2 systems. In particular, the engagement of decision makers at Ministry of Defence level and operational planning staff at the highest level of operational command is considered to be essential. Regarding implementation of the FMN technical aspects, Norway has chosen not to create a dedicated implementation programme. Instead, FMN Spiral Specifications will be injected into upgrades of existing systems and emerging projects. border Poland is implementing a Polish Mission Network (PMN) in accordance with FMN Spiral Specifications. It consists of a permanent Polish Mission Network Element to which units can connect their network extensions during national and multinational exercises. For the first time PMN was successfully implemented during Exercise Anakonda 2016 as the main part of a federation based on five Mission Network Elements. PMN instantiation is also being used by NATO's enhanced Forward Presence (eFP) as the capability ready for interoperability with NATO's NRF and VJTF. border The United Kingdom has built upon its experiences in Afghanistan to develop mission configurable capabilities as described in Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015. This work aligns to FMN with the MAGPIE system utilizing FMN Spiral 1 Specification which is already in service with HQ ARRC. The New Style of IT (NSoIT) programme has subsumed the work initiated by the Information Superiority in Contingent Operations (ISCO) research programme and JACKDAW equipment programme to develop a configurable system that will meet the Spiral 2 specification and be readily updateable to future FMN spirals. Whilst MAGPIE is predominantly a land system, NSoIT will be deployed across the whole of the British Armed Forces. border The United States implementation program is known under the name of 'Mission Partner Environment' (MPE) and it reflects US DoD desire to be an FMN affiliate. From the technical perspective, the US DoD CIO's office has been working on the Mission Partner Environment Information System (MPE- IS), which provides the ability to change things quickly so that networks can be: set up quickly to support the joint force; broken down very quickly; and federated to exchange information in support of the joint force, the DoD and mission partners. MPE-IS aligns with NATO's FMN capability, enhancing the mission and ability to work with mission partners. For continuity of historical references, it is useful to know that both FMN and the US MPE efforts started out under the moniker 'Future Mission Network' but underwent name changes in 2012 to avoid inevitable confusion due to association with something that was 'always in the future' or limited to materiel oriented IT and network solutions.

Built in 1890, the main farmhouse is a well-preserved example of a connected New England farmstead. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. Description and history Drake Farm is located in northern North Hampton, on the north side of Lafayette Road (U.S. Route 1) east of its junction with North Road. The property consists of about of land, most of which is now forested. The farmstead is located near the road, with an intervening grassy area adorned by a small wellhouse and a boulder-mounted historical marker. The farmstead is a classic New England 19th-century connected farmstead, with a main house, two-story ell, \\"back barn\\", and main barn. The main house is 2-1/2 stories in height and four bays wide, with a side gable roof and single-story porch. The ell is also four bays wide, but narrower and more simply decorated. The main barn is a large rectangular structure with multiple bay entrances on the street-facing ground floor. The property was first farmed in the early 18th century, when Abraham Drake built a house near where the wellhouse stands. That house was occupied by five generation of Drakes, including a soldier in the American Revolutionary War. The present main house block was either built here in 1889-90, or was moved here then from another location; internal evidence suggests it may have been built as early as 1870. The \\"back barn\\" connecting it to the main barn is of older construction. The house remained in the Drake family until 1986; the barn has been rehabilitated for commercial uses.

Early life and Education Seagrave was born in Cheyenne, Wyoming, the daughter of Arthur Amasa Seagrave and Selina Stone Glass Seagrave. Selina Seagrave died at age 38 when Mabel was age 4. The next year, the family moved to Seattle, Washington. While in Seattle, Mabel's father married a woman named Sarah Chatham. Her father built and operated hotels in Seattle where the Seagrave family lived. Seagrave graduated as valedictorian from Seattle High School in 1900. Seagrave attended Wellesley College, graduating in 1905. At Wellesley, Seagrave excelled in math, biology, and chemistry. She was a literary editor of the College News, treasurer of the executive board of Student Government, and she helped secure the championship for her class in the college‚Äôs 1902 Field Day by winning the low-hurdles event.

WFS Technologies Ltd launched Seatooth, the world's first commercially available underwater radio modem to the subsea market in 2006. 2007 saw the launch of the first underwater wireless broadband data link followed by the first hybrid radio/acoustic modem. In comparing wireless technologies subsea radio waves prefer shallow water and can cross the air/water/seabed boundaries easily. Subsea radio communication is generally limited to under 50m through seawater. Subsea radio waves are unaffected by turbidity, salinity and pressure gradients and also has a notable difference between acoustic and optical technologies in that radio waves can pass through the water-air and water-seabed boundaries easily. Subsea acoustics are efficient at long-range of up to 20 km and have relatively low power consumption for their range. Acoustic communication systems generally perform poorly in shallow water and complex environments and has a limited bandwidth. Subsea optical has an ultra- high bandwidth and a very short range. Subsea optical communication does not cross the water/air boundary and is susceptible to turbidity. Most under water sensor networks choose acoustics as the medium for wireless transmission. Electromagnetic waves offer great merits for transmission in special under water environments.

Life The son of Richard Phillips, an actor, he was born in Bristol on 13 August 1801. At age eight he appeared as a boy singer at Harrogate Theatre, and soon afterwards was engaged to sing soprano parts, first at the Haymarket Theatre, and then at Drury Lane Theatre. Phillips became a pupil of Mr Broadhurst, and began his career as a bass at Covent Garden in Henry Rowley Bishop's Law of Java. At this time he was baritone, occasionally singing as a bass. His voice was weak, and he moved to Bath. He returned to London in 1823, studied under Sir George Smart, and was engaged by Charles Kemble to sing in Thomas Arne's Artaxerxes; but was a failure in it. In 1824, however, Phillips sang Caspar in a production of Der Freisch√ºtz, with success, and his reputation rose. He participated in provincial musical festivals, and had much theatre and concert work. In 1825 he became principal bass at the Concerts of Antient Music, and entered the choir of London's Bavarian Chapel. In 1834 he sang at the Lyceum Theatre in Edward Loder's Nourjahad and in John Barnett's The Mountain Sylph, making a success of the ballad Farewell to the Mountain. In 1843 Phillips began a series of \\"table entertainments\\", which he continued at intervals to the end of his career. In 1844 he visited America. On his return he sang in Maritana by Vincent Wallace, and Elijah. Mendelssohn composed a \\"scena\\" for him to words from Ossian, On Lena's gloomy heath, and he sang it at the Philharmonic Concert on 15 March 1847. After this his voice declined. His engagements gradually dropped off, and he retired at a farewell concert given on 25 February 1863. Phillips then worked as a teacher, first at Birmingham, and then near London. He died at Dalston on 8 November 1876, and was buried at Brookwood Cemetery in Woking. Works Phillips composed music for many songs, including \\"The best of all good Company\\", and \\"Shall I, wastynge in despaire\\". His autobiography appeared as Musical and Personal Recollections of Half a Century, 2 vols., London, 1864. He also wrote Hints on Declamation, London, 1848, and The True Enjoyment of Angling, London, 1843.

It is roughly bounded by Madison, Washington, and Vernon Streets, and Zion Hill Cemetery, and has well-preserved examples of vernacular Queen Anne and Colonial Revival architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Description and history Until the mid-19th century, the Frog Hollow area on the south side of Hartford was predominantly farmland, with some country estate houses on Washington Street, a main north‚Äìsouth road. By 1880, Broad Street paralleled Washington to the west, and the area between Madison and Vernon Streets had a few houses west of Washington. The area was significantly developed in the 1890s, and was essentially built out after a second major round of building in the 1910s. The houses built here were generally first occupied by lower-class white collar workers in Hartford's industries, commercial establishments, and the increasingly important insurance industry. The historic district consists of all of the houses facing Allen Place and Lincoln Street, between Washington Street and Affleck Street, and continuing about 1/2 block further west on Allen Place. A few houses are included that face Affleck and Broad Streets, the two north‚Äìsouth cross streets in the district. Most of the houses are 1-1/2 to 3 stories in height, and house between one and three units. Most are of wood frame construction, although there are a few instances of brick construction. There are several places where virtually identical houses were built side-by-side, an act of economy by the builders. Most of the housing has elements of either Queen Anne or Colonial Revival styling (or some combination), although early examples have some Italianate features.

She has won an Inkpot Award and the Prix de la critique. Biography Katin was born in 1942, in wartime Budapest. While her father served in the Hungarian army, she and her mother escaped the Nazi occupation of Hungary by faking their own deaths and acquiring false identification documents. In 1957, Katin and her family settled in Israel. There she joined a graphic arts studio in Tel Aviv as an apprentice, and in 1960 she joined the Israel Defense Forces for two years as a graphic artist. In 1963 Katin moved to New York and married Geoffrey Katin a music educator. They have two sons, Aaron a musician and Ilan an artist. In 1981 the family moved to (kibbutz)Ein Gedi, where she worked as a background designer for Ein Gedi Animation. In 1990 the Katins returned to New York where she continued working in background design for the Walt Disney Animation Studios, Nickelodeon Animation Studio and MTV Animation until 2000. At MTV, she worked on Daria and Beavis and Butt-Head. Katin started creating comics in the 2000s. She said, \\"I discovered comics for myself at age 63.\\" Inspired by Art Spiegelman's graphic novel Maus, a Holocaust memoir, she started to work on her first graphic novel, about her and her mother's experiences during World War II. The finished product, titled We Are on Our Own, was published by Drawn and Quarterly in 2006. It is drawn in black-and-white pencil and incorporates some of Katin's family photos. She created her second graphic novel, Letting It Go, published in 2013, in response to her \\"enormous need to deal with my trauma of my son's decision to move to Berlin\\". Letting It Go is also autobiographical, depicting her initial reaction to her son's move to Berlin, and her own visit to Germany, including Berlin's Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe. In contrast to her first novel, it is drawn in colored crayons. Katin lives in Washington Heights in Manhattan with her husband. She considers herself American rather than Hungarian or Israeli. Awards Katin won a 2007 Inkpot Award. In 2006, We Are on Our Own was nominated for an Eisner Award and an Ignatz Award for Outstanding Story.

It is located in Hartwell, Georgia at 150 Benson Street. In 2016 the library was named Georgia's Public Library of the Year. Hart County Library is a member of PINES, a program of the Georgia Public Library Service that covers 53 library systems in 143 counties of Georgia. Any resident in a PINES supported library system has access to the system's 10.6 million book collection. The library is also serviced by GALILEO, a program of the University System of Georgia which stands for \\"GeorgiA LIbrary LEarning Online\\". This program offers residents in supported libraries access to over 100 databases indexing thousands of periodicals and scholarly journals. It also boasts over 10,000 journal titles in full text. History =Founding= In 1938 the first iteration of a county library in Hart County began with the Hartwell Woman's Club appointing a library committee and requesting book donations from each member of the community. Books at this time were housed in the Community Woman's Club House and circulated twice a week by volunteers. By 1939, with the advent of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's Public Works Administration, a paid librarian was hired and the collection was moved to a nearby drug store with rent paid for by various support groups in the community. In 1941, the Hart County Courthouse underwent renovations and planned to add an annex to house the county library collection. After the addition, the library moved their collection (at the time composed of 600 volumes) into the newly vacant offices of the Ordinary and Clerk of the Court. Here the library was housed until a fire in 1968 burned down the court house, along with many of the books. With a county decision to rebuild the courthouse came a new decree that the library wouldn't be included in the new plans. Without a building to house their books, the Hart County library board decided to temporarily join with neighboring Elbert County to create their own small library system named the War Woman Regional Library System. =Current Building= In 1973 the library board completed an application with the Georgia Division of Public Library Services for funding of a new library building. The division matched $150,000 raised by the community, and by 1975 the current 10,000 square foot new building finished construction. By 1987, in need of some more space, one final addition was added to the library. This new floor space increased the layout of the library by 5,000 square feet providing space for book stacks, a meeting room, and storage.

The Coastal Road is projected to be used by 130,000 vehicles daily and is expected to reduce travel time between South Mumbai and the Western Suburbs from 2 hours to 40 minutes. The estimated cost of the project is . Its first phase, a 9.98 km section from Princess Street flyover to the Worli end of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link, is expected to be completed by mid-2022.  Planning  Wilbur Smith and Associates, commissioned in 1962 to study transportation in Mumbai, recommended construction of a 3.6 km road between Haji Ali and Nariman Point on reclaimed land and 1.04 km tunnel under Malabar Hill up to Girgaum Chowpatty. Smith's report also proposed connectors to Walkeshwar Road and Chowpatty. However, the proposed road was not built. In 2011, Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan proposed the Coastal Road as an alternative to the plan for the Western Freeway. Chavan asked the MSRDC to think of building coastal roads instead of capital intensive sea links. He appointed a Joint Technical Committee, comprising experts and officials, in 2012 under the then Municipal commissioner Subodh Kumar to study the plan to build a coastal road. In its report, submitted in January 2012, the committee advised the government to build a 35.6 km coastal freeway from Manora MLA Hostel at Nariman Point to Kandivali to ease traffic congestion. The project was estimated to cost and would have consisted of roads built on reclaimed land as well as stilts, bridges and tunnels. The committee was against building any more sea links and pointed out that the coastal road would help save of public money. The 35.6 km road was proposed to begin near Manora (MLA Hostel), with entry and exit points at Jagannath Bhosale Marg, move along Marine Drive and lead into a tunnel that would go under Malabar Hill and exit on the other side of Priyadarshini Park. This stretch was proposed to be built on reclaimed portions up to Haji Ali, and then to Lala Lajpatrai Road in Worli. The coastal freeway would then be connected to the Worli arm of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link by a bridge. On the Bandra side, the coastal road skirting the fort would connect the coastal freeway up to Chimbai village, where a bridge was proposed. A road by reclamation of mangroves, further north, or a road on stilts, and an elevated road between Oshiwara and Malad was also proposed. The proposed freeway would have had 18 entry and exit points along its route. The project is estimated to cost ‚Äî, and take 5 years to complete. Critics of the freeway opposed it due to the reclamation required and have also cited possible environmental degradation along the coast. Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) norms in India disallow reclamation of land. Construction of the coastal freeway would require a relaxation of the CRZ norms, as certain sections are proposed on reclaimed land. The change in norms can only be done through an amendment to the law by the Central Government. After discussing the project on 10 April 2013, the Maharashtra coastal zone management authority (MCZMA), the state's apex environment body, urged the Centre to amend the CRZ notification to permit \\"reclamation for roads\\". The MCZMA stated that reclamation should not be permitted for any other development activity and that the high tide line must not be altered. The MCZMA also argued that the ring road would serve as a protection wall from inland flooding, besides being a vital road link for decongesting traffic. During a meeting between Prithviraj Chavan and Union environment minister Jayanthi Natarajan on 20 June 2013, Natarajan expressed concerns about the implications of relaxing CRZ norms, on creeks and mangroves. However, the minister stated that she would \\"put the state's proposal at the next meeting [24 June 2013] of the National Coastal Zone Management Authority\\". However, despite specific assurance from the minister, the National Coastal Zone Management Authority (NCZMA) decided not to include the coastal road plan in their next meeting's agenda. During the 2014 assembly elections, the BJP promised to implement the project if elected. The project was modified and fast tracked after the party came to power. On 6 June 2015, the State Government signed an MoU with the Dutch Government for technical co-operation in implementing the project. The Netherlands is known for its environment-friendly reclamation and the use of the sea. On 8 June 2015, the coastal road project received clearance from the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests. Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray stated on 26 November 2016 that a survey of the soil at the seabed was being undertaken. The project received final clearance from the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change on 11 May 2017. The foundation stone for the project was laid at Amarsons Garden in Cumbala Hill on 16 December 2018. The Environment Ministry asked the BMC to deposit 2% of the total project cost with the Mangrove Cell, a state government organization tasked with conserving mangroves. The BMC stated that it would pay the amount in instalments with the first payment of , and subsequent payments being made as the project work progresses.  Construction  The Coastal Road will be built in two phases. It will have 8 lanes, including 2 lanes dedicated for a bus rapid transit system. The project will require the reclamation of of land from the sea. AECOM is the project's General Consultant. A CRCHI slurry tunnel boring machine for the Priyadarshini Park - Marine Drive section arrived in Mumbai on April 26. =Phase I= The first phase of the project is a 9.98 km section from Princess Street Flyover at Marine Lines to the Worli end of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link (BWSL). The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation awarded contracts for the project in four packages in October 2018. Larsen and Toubro was awarded Package 1 and 4 at a cost of , and a joint venture between Hindustan Construction Company (55%) and Hyundai Development Company (45%) was awarded Package 2 and 3 at a cost of . Package 1 includes the construction of a 3.82 km long section over reclaimed land from Priyadarshini Park to Baroda Palace and interchanges at Amarson Garden and Haji Ali. Package 4 includes the construction of a 3.93 km section from Princess Street flyover to Priyadarshini Park, including the up and down ramps from Marine Drive connecting to the twin tunnels passing below Girgaum Chowpatty, Malabar Hills and exit at Priyadarshini Park to connect with section in Package 1. Packages 2 and 3 involves a bridge spanning 0.9 km, an interchange, a 3.2-km-long ramp and a 1.9-km embankment between Baroda Palace near Haji Ali and the Worli end of Bandra Worli Sea Link. Construction on the project began in October 2018, and was expected to be completed in 2022. Nine petitioners moved the Bombay High Court seeking to halt construction alleging that land reclamation was illegal and would irreversibly alter the coastal environment. On 16 April 2019, the High Court ordered all construction activities on the project to be halted until 3 June 2019. On 26 April 2019, the BMC appealed the order in the Supreme Court. The agency stated that it had received all required permissions to carry out construction and that delay due to the stay order was causing a loss of per day. On 6 May, the Supreme Court permitted contractors to continue work in areas where construction had already begun but prohibited beginning work in any new areas pending the Bombay High Court's decision in June 2019. Contractors resumed piling work at Amarsons Garden within hours of the Supreme Court decision. BMC officials stated on 14 May that round-the-clock construction had resumed at all project sites covered by the Supreme Court's order. The agency had already begun construction activities for about 17% of the total work on Phase I. The work includes construction of a sea wall, site offices for engineers, and pits for construction of the two tunnels. The BMC stated that it had expected to complete this work before the start of the monsoon season and had planned to pause construction during the monsoon to reduce impact on marine life. Due to the delays caused by the Court case, the agency stated that it would continue construction throughout the monsoon season whenever it was possible to do so without impacting marine life. The BMC filed affidavits in response to the petitions challenging the project in the High Court on 3 June. The Court commenced hearings on the petitions from 17 June. The BMC stated that it had received all necessary environmental approvals related to the project. The Court reserved judgment on the public interest litigations on 1 July, and will commence final hearings on 17 July 2019. On 16 July, the Bombay High Court cancelled the approval granted by MCZMA and by the MoEF to the Coastal Road project citing a lack of \\"proper scientific study\\". The Court ruled that the MCGM could not proceed with construction until they obtained an environmental clearance after a proper Environmental Impact Assessment was conducted, and the MCZMA would require permission under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. On 27 July, the Supreme Court refused to stay the High Court's order halting construction on the project. However, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the MCGM's plea seeking interim relief on 20 August. The BMC administration informed corporators on 21 August that work had been completely halted since 16 July. The agency stated that it had completed 6.25% of the total work on the project and had spent . The BMC also stated that it had planned to complete 12.56% of the work at this stage but was unable to do so due to the legal hurdles. Contractors began decommissioning machinery and equipment from work sites in September 2019. BMC chief Praveen Pardeshi stated that work would only resume after the Supreme Court verdict. Hindustan Times quoted an unnamed BMC official as stating that the machinery was being removed from the Tata Garden area to facilitate the filming of the Hollywood film Tenet. =Phase 2= Work on the second phase, a 19.22 km road between the Bandra end of the BWSL and Kandivali, will be constructed by MSRDC. The phase includes the 9.5 km Versova-Bandra Sea Link. Alignment The Coastal Road will begin from the traffic signal near Wankhede Stadium south of Princess Street flyover. A two lane road will be constructed from the traffic signal near the Stadium for north-bound traffic. A portion of the existing C-shaped promenade will be utilized to construct the road, and a new 1-km long and 8‚Äì10 meters wide promenade will be built to compensate for the loss pedestrian space due to project. The new promenade will run parallel to Coastal Road, on its seaward side, go over the tunnel near Charni Road station and continue north along the alignment providing a contiguous pedestrian walkway from the NCPA to Girgaum Chowpatty. The promenade will be constructed on a cantilever bridge ensuring that sea waves can flow without colliding with the structure. It will also prevent the tides from washing over the promenade as is common on the existing Marine Drive during the monsoon season. The two-lane road for north-bound traffic from Wankhede Stadium will enter into a tunnel near Charni Road station. On the opposite side of the road, two lanes for southbound traffic emerge from the tunnel and merge onto the existing service road outside Wilson Gymkhana. The project will occupy a portion of the Gymkhana grounds and reduce the existing service road to a 6.6 metre wide single-lane service road with a footpath. The tunnels run under Malabar Hill, after which the Coastal Road continues north and emerges above ground. The highway passes over a bridge near Samudra Mahal building, continues on reclaimed land before passing over another bridge over the Worli Nullah. The Coastal Road continues north on reclaimed land and a small sea link connects it with the Worli end of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link. This Coastal Road will also include interchanges at Haji Ali, Breach Candy, Amarsons Garden, Worli and Bandra. The Haji Ali interchange is a multi-level structure with four feeder roads to facilitate access to the Coastal Road from any direction of approach to the Haji Ali signal. Two arms of interchange cross over each other at a height of 24 metres above sea level. The Breach Candy interchange had four ramps all connecting to Bhulabhai Desai Road (also called Warden Road).

The site was also known as Manton Wood Colliery. History The land was owned by Henry Pelham-Clinton, 7th Duke of Newcastle. Shafts were dug through Sherwood Sandstone and Lower Magnesian Limestone. The engine house was built in 1905. The mine was fully operational in around 1907, with three shafts. The first death at the pit occurred on 23 October 1903. Manton, the village, was a new model village built to house the miners. In the 1984 miners' strike, the pit was the scene of some ugly episodes. =Closure= The pit closed on 11 February 1994.Worksop Guardian Around 1,500 people worked at the pit when it closed. At the time of closure there were eight pits in Nottinghamshire. Many pits closed from 1993‚Äì94, and Manton was the 29th to close in one year. It was the eighth pit in Bassetlaw to close after the 1984 miner's strike. Structure It was sited off the A57 at the B6040 roundabout. The Sheffield- Lincoln Line ran east-west to the north of the site. Shunters from the pit are preserved at Peak Rail in Derbyshire. Ownership After nationalisation (Coal Industry Nationalisation Act 1946) on 1 January 1947, the pit was put in the South Yorkshire Region, not the Nottinghamshire region. Production In 1979, over a million tonnes of coal was extracted from the pit; most went to the CEGB's Cottam Power Station. Once privatisation of the electricity industry had taken place in 1990, power stations were under less onus to burn coal as a primary form of power (base load), known as the Dash for Gas, which may have largely led to the pit's closure.

He is currently a professor in the Department of Communication Studies and Faculty Affiliate in Public Health at The College of New Jersey, where he has taught since 1992. He was educated at Swarthmore College, The Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs (Syracuse University), The Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, and Stanford University.  Community Structure Theory = Key Contributions = Pollock‚Äôs first book outlining a ‚Äúcommunity structure approach‚Äù, Tilted Mirrors: Media Alignment with Political and Social Change ‚Äì A Community Structure Approach], was published by Hampton Press in 2007. In that book, using a US multi-city comparative framework, Pollock outlined systematic patterns that link demographic characteristics of communities with variations in media coverage of critical issues. Articulating a ‚Äúbottom-up‚Äù perspective on the formation of content of local media and public opinion, Pollock used community structure theory to challenge a prevailing, established mass media theory, ‚Äúagenda-setting‚Äù, a ‚Äútop-down‚Äù perspective suggesting that the content of both local media and public opinion is essentially ‚Äúset‚Äù by what is reported in leading national media, in particular newspapers. A subsequent empirical study by one of the ‚Äúfathers‚Äù of agenda setting, Maxwell McCombs and a co-author, systematically compared the relative influence of both community structure theory and agenda-setting theory and found that community structure theory offers robust explanatory power in accounting for variations in coverage of critical issues in the US. In 2011, Pollock furthered the development of community structure theory by collecting innovative scholarship in that tradition in a special issue of ‚ÄúMass Communication and Society‚Äù (volume 14, issue 6), subsequently issued as a book edited by Pollock in 2013, Media and Social Inequality: Innovations in Community Structure Research, published by Routledge. After documenting the value of community structure theory in empirical studies in the US, Pollock combined both US multi-city and the first cross-national studies using community structure theory in a special issue of the ‚ÄúAtlantic Journal of Communication‚Äù (volume 22, issues 3-4, July-October 2014), subsequently issued as an edited book in 2015. Pollock and coauthors made four key contributions to community structure theory. First, they conducted among the first US nationwide and cross-national studies using the community structure model, comparing multiple large metropolitan areas and countries, expanding study sample sizes beyond a focus on one or two cities. Second, Pollock and co- authors isolated three major umbrella ‚Äúhypotheses‚Äù or ‚Äúpatterns‚Äù connecting community structure and variations in reporting on social change: a) The ‚Äúbuffer‚Äù hypothesis expects that higher proportions of privileged groups in communities would be linked with reporting relatively appreciative of human rights claims; b) the ‚Äúvulnerability‚Äù hypothesis expects that reporting on social change will reflect the interests of society‚Äôs most ‚Äúvulnerable‚Äù elements (the poor, the unemployed, the uninsured, single-parent families, etc.); and c) the ‚Äústakeholder‚Äù hypothesis expects that reporting on social change will reflect the interests of particular issue stakeholders, defined in terms of ethnic identity, political party identity, belief system, generation, or position in the family lifecycle. Third, Pollock also made community structure theory more sophisticated by including a Media Vector methodological tool for coding both content direction and editorial prominence of articles, then combining them into a single score, thereby introducing a composite measure of both editorial evaluation and article content. Fourth, Pollock and coauthor findings often challenged the traditional ‚Äúguard dog‚Äù hypothesis by uncovering patterns revealing that media can often reflect the interests of more vulnerable stakeholders. In 2008, Pollock authored the entry on the \\"Community Structure model\\" for the International Encyclopedia of Communication], and in 2013, he authored an authoritative annotated bibliography.

It operated in six Chinese cities, and briefly operated in San Francisco, United States in 2017. The station-less bicycle-sharing system used a mobile app to unlock bicycles. The company went bankrupt in November 2017. History Bluegogo was founded in November 2016 by Gang \\"Tony\\" Li (), the owner of bicycle manufacturer SpeedX, as part of a boom in private bikeshare companies in China led by Mobike and Ofo. The company began operating in Shenzen and expanded to Guangzhou and Chengdu by January 2017, operating over 70,000 bicycles in total. Bluegogo uses its own bicycle manufacturing plant and raised ¬•237 million RMB ($34 million USD) in venture capital. Further expansions in Beijing and Nanjing in early 2017 brought the total number of Chinese cities to six. In January 2017, Bluegogo announced plans to expand overseas to San Francisco, intending to \\"disrupt\\" the bike-sharing industry in the United States. The announcement was met with resistance from local politicians, who objected to the lack of planning and permits for the \\"dumping of tens of thousands of bicycles\\" onto city streets. Bluegogo scaled back its rollout plans and sought to cooperate with the city government, which later approved regulations on station-less bicycle-sharing systems to avoid similar problems in the future. After failing to secure commercial permits, Bluegogo suspended its San Francisco operations and took their bicycles off the streets. According to The Seattle Times, Bluegogo has been discussing a launch in Seattle, along with rival private bicycle-sharing companies LimeBike and Spin. On 16 November 2017, Chinese media sources reported that the company had declared bankruptcy and shuttered operations after burning through 600 million yuan ($119 million USD) in funds. The bankruptcy was called by analysts as the first sign of a bursting of China‚Äôs bike-sharing bubble. Green Bike-Transit (), a Guangzhou-based company, took over Bluegogo's operations. Many of its users complained on social media that deposits were hard to refund. The Bluegogo app has since been removed from the Apple App Store and Google Play. Their official website has also gone defunct. As of December 2017, the remaining Bluegogo bicycles on the streets can no longer be unlocked and are left abandoned, attracting vandalism and abuse on those uncollected bikes. Didi Chuxing signed an agreement with Bluegogo to partly acquire the assets of the company in December 2017, expanding Didi's business into the bike-sharing sector.

Chemically, deutetrabenazine is an isotopic isomer of tetrabenazine in which six hydrogen atoms have been replaced by deuterium atoms. The incorporation of deuterium slows the rate of drug metabolism, allowing less frequent dosing. Efficacy A Lancet study published on June 28, 2017 carried out a review between October 29, 2014 and August 19, 2016 where 298 patients were randomly assigned to receive at least one of the following: one dose of placebo per day, one dose of deutetrabenazine 12 mg/day, one dose of deutetrabenazine 24 mg/day, or one dose of deutetrabenazine 36 mg/day. From baseline to week 12, the least- squares mean AIMS (Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale) score improved by ‚àí3.3 points in the deutetrabenazine 36 mg/day group, ‚àí3.2 points in the 24 mg/day group, ‚àí2.1 points in the 12 mg/day group, and ‚àí1.4 points in the placebo group. Deutetrabenazine 24 mg/day and 36 mg/day provided a significant reduction in tardive dyskinesia, with favourable safety and tolerability. These findings suggest that dosing regimens could be individualized and tailored for patients on the basis of dyskinesia control and tolerability. History Teva Pharmaceuticals received approval from the Food and Drug Administration to market deutetrabenazine in early 2017, along with five years of orphan drug exclusivity for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington's disease.
